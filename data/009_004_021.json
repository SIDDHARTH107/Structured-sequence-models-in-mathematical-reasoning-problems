    "message_2": "To determine the position equation of a damped mass-spring system, we need to consider the damped harmonic oscillator equation:\n\nm * x''(t) + c * x'(t) + k * x(t) = 0\n\nwhere m is the mass (2 kg), c is the damping coefficient (1.2 kg/s), k is the spring constant (5 N/m), and x(t) is the position of the mass as a function of time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the characteristic equation of the system:\n\n2 * r^2 + 1.2 * r + 5 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation:\n\nr = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2, b = 1.2, and c = 5.\n\nr = (-1.2 ± √(1.2^2 - 4 * 2 * 5)) / (2 * 2)\nr = (-1.2 ± √(-38.8)) / 4\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\nr = -0.3 ± √(9.7) * i\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the damped harmonic oscillator:\n\nx(t) = e^(-0.3t) * (A * cos(√9.7 * t) + B * sin(√9.7 * t))\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we need to use the initial conditions. The system is initially displaced 3 cm (0.03 m) from its equilibrium position:\n\nx(0) = 0.03 = e^(0) * (A * cos(0) + B * sin(0))\n0.03 = A\n\nThe initial velocity of the system is 0 since it is released from rest:\n\nx'(t) = -0.3 * e^(-0.3t) * (A * cos(√9.7 * t) + B * sin(√9.7 * t)) + e^(-0.3t) * (-A * √9.7 * sin(√9.7 * t) + B * √9.7 * cos(√9.7 * t))\n\nx'(0) = 0 = -0.3 * (0.03) + B * √9.7\nB = 0.009\n\nFinally, we can write the position equation for the damped mass-spring system:\n\nx(t) = e^(-0.3t) * (0.03 * cos(√9.7 * t) + 0.009 * sin(√9.7 * t))"
