    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole is 53°. If the flagpole is 20 feet tall, how far is the point from the base of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance from the point on the ground to the base of the flagpole as x. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation, the height of the flagpole, and the distance x.\n\nThe tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (in this case, the height of the flagpole) to the adjacent side (the distance x) in a right triangle. So, we have:\n\ntan(53°) = (20 feet) / x\n\nTo find the distance x, we can rearrange the equation and solve for x:\n\nx = (20 feet) / tan(53°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 20 / 1.3333\nx ≈ 15.01 feet\n\nSo, the point is approximately 15.01 feet away from the base of the flagpole."
