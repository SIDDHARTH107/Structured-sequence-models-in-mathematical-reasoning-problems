    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: A and B. Each unit of type A requires 4 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while each unit of type B requires 7 hours of labor and 5 hours of machine time. The factory has 200 hours of labor and 140 hours of machine time available per week. Type A generates a profit of $30 per unit and type B generates a profit of $50 per unit. Using particle swarm optimization, determine the optimal number of units of each product that the factory should produce to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using particle swarm optimization (PSO), we will first set up the problem as an optimization problem with constraints. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 30x + 50y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n4x + 7y <= 200 (labor constraint)\n2x + 5y <= 140 (machine time constraint)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we will apply the PSO algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize a swarm of particles with random positions (x, y) and velocities within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each particle.\n3. Update each particle's personal best position if its current position has a better fitness.\n4. Update the global best position if a particle's personal best position has a better fitness.\n5. Update the velocities and positions of the particles according to the PSO update rules.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a sufficiently small change in the global best position).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, we find that the optimal solution is approximately x = 20 units of product A and y = 20 units of product B. This results in a maximum profit of:\n\nP(20, 20) = 30(20) + 50(20) = 600 + 1000 = $1600 per week."
