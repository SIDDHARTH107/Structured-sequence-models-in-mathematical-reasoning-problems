    "message_2": "There are five distinct isomorphism classes possible for a group of order 20. These classes are:\n\n1. Cyclic group: A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. In this case, the group is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 20, denoted as Z_20 or C_20. An example of a group in this class is the set of integers modulo 20 under addition, {0, 1, 2, ..., 19}.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: The group can be represented as the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 4 and 5, which are coprime. This group is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_5 or C_4 × C_5. An example of a group in this class is the set of ordered pairs of integers modulo 4 and modulo 5 under component-wise addition, {(0,0), (0,1), ..., (3,4)}.\n\n3. Dihedral group: The dihedral group of order 20, denoted as D_10 or D_20, is the group of symmetries of a regular decagon, including rotations and reflections. An example of a group in this class is the set of symmetries of a regular decagon.\n\n4. Dicyclic group: The dicyclic group of order 20, denoted as Dic_10 or Dic_20, is a non-abelian group that is a generalization of the dihedral group. It can be defined by the presentation: ⟨a, b | a^10 = b^2 = e, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩. An example of a group in this class is the set of 20 elements generated by a and b satisfying the given relations.\n\n5. Semidirect product of Z_5 and Z_4: The group can be represented as the semidirect product of Z_5 and Z_4, denoted as Z_5 ⋊ Z_4 or C_5 ⋊ C_4. This group is non-abelian and can be defined by the presentation: ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^4 = e, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩. An example of a group in this class is the set of 20 elements generated by a and b satisfying the given relations."
