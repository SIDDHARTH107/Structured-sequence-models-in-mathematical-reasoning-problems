    "message_1": "In constructing the Sierpinski tetrahedron, you start with a large tetrahedron with an edge length of 16 cm. For each step, you remove the inner tetrahedron with an edge length of half the previous tetrahedron. How many vertices does the Sierpinski tetrahedron have after 5 steps of construction?",
    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron is a fractal that is constructed by recursively removing tetrahedra from the initial tetrahedron. After each step, the number of vertices remains the same, since the removed tetrahedron shares its vertices with the remaining tetrahedra.\n\nThe initial tetrahedron has 4 vertices. After each step, no new vertices are added, so the Sierpinski tetrahedron will still have 4 vertices after 5 steps of construction."
