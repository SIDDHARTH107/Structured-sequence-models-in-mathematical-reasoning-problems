    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x for -π < x < π with a single discontinuity at x = 0, we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients. To find the b_n coefficients, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[x * sin(nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(nx) dx\nThen, du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[x * sin(nx) dx] = x * (-1/n) * cos(nx) - ∫[(-1/n) * cos(nx) dx]\n\nNow, integrate (-1/n) * cos(nx) with respect to x:\n\n∫[(-1/n) * cos(nx) dx] = (-1/n^2) * sin(nx)\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n∫[x * sin(nx) dx] = x * (-1/n) * cos(nx) - (-1/n^2) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from -π to π:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [((π * (-1/n) * cos(nπ) - (-1/n^2) * sin(nπ)) - (-π * (-1/n) * cos(-nπ) - (-1/n^2) * sin(-nπ)))]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ) = 0, the expression simplifies to:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1)^n * π^2 / n - (-1)^n * π^2 / n] = 0\n\nSo, all the b_n coefficients are also zero. However, due to the discontinuity at x = 0, we need to find the average value of the function over the interval -π < x < π. The average value of the function is given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) dx] from -π to π\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[x dx] from -π to π\n\nIntegrating x with respect to x, we get:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2 / 2] from -π to π = (1/π) * [(π^2 / 2) - (-π^2 / 2)] = π\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x for -π < x < π with a single discontinuity at x = 0 is:\n\nf(x) = π"
