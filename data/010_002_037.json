    "message_2": "1) To study the uniform convergence of the sequence (f_n), we need to find the limit function f(x) and check if the convergence is uniform.\n\nFor x in [0, 1], we have:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) f_n(x) = lim (n -> ∞) x^n\n\nIf 0 ≤ x < 1, then lim (n -> ∞) x^n = 0, because x^n goes to 0 as n goes to infinity.\n\nIf x = 1, then lim (n -> ∞) x^n = 1^n = 1.\n\nSo, the limit function f(x) is defined as:\n\nf(x) = { 0 if 0 ≤ x < 1,\n         1 if x = 1 }\n\nNow, let's check for uniform convergence. For a given ε > 0, we need to find an N such that for all n ≥ N and all x in [0, 1], we have |f_n(x) - f(x)| < ε.\n\nLet's consider the case when x is in [0, 1):\n\n|f_n(x) - f(x)| = |x^n - 0| = x^n\n\nSince x^n is continuous and x^n -> 0 as n -> ∞ for x in [0, 1), there exists an N such that for all n ≥ N and x in [0, 1), we have x^n < ε. However, for x = 1, we have:\n\n|f_n(1) - f(1)| = |1^n - 1| = 0\n\nSo, for x = 1, the convergence is trivially uniform.\n\nTherefore, the sequence (f_n) converges uniformly on [0, 1].\n\n2) The limit function f(x) is continuous on [0, 1]. To see this, consider the two cases:\n\na) For 0 ≤ x < 1, f(x) = 0, which is a constant function and therefore continuous.\n\nb) For x = 1, f(x) = 1. The function f(x) is continuous at x = 1 if the left limit and the value of the function at x = 1 are equal:\n\nlim (x -> 1-) f(x) = lim (x -> 1-) 0 = 0\n\nHowever, f(1) = 1, so the limit function f(x) is not continuous at x = 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the sequence (f_n) converges uniformly on [0, 1], but the limit function f(x) is not continuous on [0, 1]."
