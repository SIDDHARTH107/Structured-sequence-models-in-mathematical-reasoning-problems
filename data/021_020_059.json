    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. Each unit of A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine processing, while each unit of B requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine processing. The company has 1000 hours of labor and 700 hours of machine processing available each week. The profit per unit of A is $150 and the profit per unit of B is $200. Use the artificial bee colony algorithm to find the optimal number of units of A and B that the company should produce each week to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm that simulates the foraging behavior of honey bees. In this case, we will use the ABC algorithm to find the optimal number of units of A and B that the company should produce each week to maximize its profit.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Number of employed bees (n): 50\n- Number of onlooker bees (m): 50\n- Maximum number of iterations (MaxIter): 1000\n- Limit for abandoning a food source: 100\n\nStep 2: Initialize the population\nRandomly generate n initial solutions (food sources) within the feasible region. Each solution represents a pair of values (x_A, x_B), where x_A is the number of units of A and x_B is the number of units of B.\n\nStep 3: Employed bees phase\nFor each employed bee, generate a new solution by modifying the current solution using a neighborhood search. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution. If the new solution is better, replace the current solution with the new solution. Otherwise, keep the current solution.\n\nStep 4: Onlooker bees phase\nCalculate the probability of selecting each food source based on its fitness. Onlooker bees select food sources based on these probabilities. For each onlooker bee, generate a new solution by modifying the selected food source using a neighborhood search. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution. If the new solution is better, replace the current solution with the new solution. Otherwise, keep the current solution.\n\nStep 5: Scout bees phase\nIf a food source has not been improved for a certain number of iterations (the limit), abandon the food source and replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n\nStep 6: Update the best solution\nUpdate the global best solution if a better solution is found.\n\nStep 7: Termination condition\nRepeat steps 3 to 6 until the maximum number of iterations (MaxIter) is reached.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm with the given parameters and constraints, we obtain the optimal solution for the number of units of A and B that the company should produce each week to maximize its profit. The optimal solution may vary depending on the initial population and random factors in the algorithm. However, the ABC algorithm should provide a near-optimal solution for this problem."
