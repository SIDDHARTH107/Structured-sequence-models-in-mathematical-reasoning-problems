    "message_2": "There are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. Out of these, 5 are abelian and 46 are non-abelian.\n\nAbelian example: The cyclic group of order 32, denoted as Z_32 or C_32. It has one generator, say g, and the presentation is given by:\n⟨g | g^32 = 1⟩\n\nNon-abelian example: The dihedral group of order 32, denoted as D_32. It has two generators, say r and s, and the presentation is given by:\n⟨r, s | r^16 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1)⟩"
