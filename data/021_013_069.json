    "message_1": "Consider a function f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 5, where x lies between -10 <= x <= 10. Use the simulated annealing method to find the global minimum value of the function f(x) and the value of x that yields the minimum value. Take the starting point to be x = 0 and the temperature at the start to be T = 1000. Run the algorithm for 100 iterations and take the cooling factor to be 0.95.",
    "message_2": "To use the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(x) and the initial parameters.\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution.\n3. Calculate the energy difference between the current solution and the neighboring solution.\n4. If the neighboring solution is better, accept it. If not, accept it with a probability based on the temperature.\n5. Update the temperature by multiplying it with the cooling factor.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the desired number of iterations.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 2 * x**2 - 8 * x + 5\n\ndef simulated_annealing(start_x, T, cooling_factor, iterations):\n    current_x = start_x\n    current_energy = f(current_x)\n\n    for i in range(iterations):\n        # Generate a random neighboring solution\n        neighbor_x = random.uniform(-10, 10)\n        neighbor_energy = f(neighbor_x)\n\n        # Calculate the energy difference\n        delta_energy = neighbor_energy - current_energy\n\n        # Accept the neighboring solution based on the temperature\n        if delta_energy < 0 or math.exp(-delta_energy / T) > random.random():\n            current_x = neighbor_x\n            current_energy = neighbor_energy\n\n        # Update the temperature\n        T *= cooling_factor\n\n    return current_x, current_energy\n\nstart_x = 0\nT = 1000\ncooling_factor = 0.95\niterations = 100\n\nmin_x, min_value = simulated_annealing(start_x, T, cooling_factor, iterations)\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x) =\", min_value, \"at x =\", min_x)\n```\n\nPlease note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the simulated annealing algorithm. Running the algorithm multiple times can help to get a more accurate result."
