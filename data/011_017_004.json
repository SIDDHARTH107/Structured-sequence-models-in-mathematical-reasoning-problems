    "message_2": "A Latin square of order n is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and once in each column. In the case of order 4, we have a 4x4 grid filled with 4 different symbols (usually numbers 1 to 4).\n\nTo count the number of Latin squares of order 4, we can use the following method:\n\n1. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to fill the first row, which is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3! ways to arrange the remaining symbols in each column, which is 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2! ways to arrange the remaining symbols in each column, which is 2! = 2 × 1 = 2 ways.\n\n4. The fourth row is determined by the previous rows since there's only one symbol left for each column.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways for each row: 24 × 6 × 2 = 288.\n\nHowever, this count includes Latin squares that are row and column permutations of each other. To account for this, we divide by the number of row permutations (4!) and the number of column permutations (4!), which is 4! × 4! = 576.\n\nSo, the number of distinct Latin squares of order 4 is 288 / 576 = 0.5. Since we can't have half a Latin square, we must have made an error in our calculation.\n\nThe correct approach is to use the fact that there are 4! ways to fill the first row and 3! ways to fill the second row. However, for the third row, we need to consider the possible arrangements of the remaining symbols that don't violate the Latin square property. There are 4 possible arrangements for the third row:\n\n1. (1, 3, 4, 2)\n2. (1, 4, 2, 3)\n3. (2, 4, 1, 3)\n4. (2, 3, 1, 4)\n\nThe fourth row is determined by the previous rows.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways for each row: 4! × 3! × 4 = 576.\n\nSo, there are 576 Latin squares of order 4."
