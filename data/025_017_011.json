    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective surface with Kähler-Einstein metric of positive scalar curvature. Suppose that there exists a birational morphism f:X→Y to a smooth projective variety Y such that the anticanonical divisor −KX is f-ample. Compute the degree of the canonical map ϕΩX→f∗ΩY where ΩX denotes the canonical bundle of X.",
    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the canonical map ϕ: ΩX → f∗ΩY, we first need to understand the relationship between the canonical bundles ΩX and ΩY. Recall that for a smooth projective surface X with Kähler-Einstein metric of positive scalar curvature, the canonical bundle ΩX is the line bundle associated to the canonical divisor KX. Since −KX is f-ample, we have that KX = -f^*(KY) for some divisor KY on Y.\n\nNow, consider the canonical map ϕ: ΩX → f∗ΩY. Since ΩX is the line bundle associated to KX and f∗ΩY is the line bundle associated to f^*(KY), we have:\n\nϕ: O_X(KX) → f∗O_Y(KY).\n\nTo compute the degree of this map, we need to compute the degree of the induced map on global sections:\n\nϕ*: H^0(X, O_X(KX)) → H^0(Y, f_*O_X(KX)).\n\nBy the projection formula, we have:\n\nf_*O_X(KX) = O_Y(f_*KX) = O_Y(-KY).\n\nThus, ϕ* is a map between the global sections of the canonical bundles:\n\nϕ*: H^0(X, O_X(KX)) → H^0(Y, O_Y(-KY)).\n\nNow, let's compute the dimensions of these spaces. Since X has a Kähler-Einstein metric of positive scalar curvature, the canonical bundle ΩX is positive, and so h^0(X, O_X(KX)) > 0. On the other hand, since −KX is f-ample, the anticanonical bundle ΩY^(-1) is positive, and so h^0(Y, O_Y(-KY)) > 0.\n\nSince both spaces have positive dimensions, the degree of the canonical map ϕ is the ratio of the dimensions of the target space to the source space:\n\ndeg(ϕ) = dim(H^0(Y, O_Y(-KY))) / dim(H^0(X, O_X(KX))).\n\nIn general, this degree depends on the specific birational morphism f and the geometry of the varieties X and Y. However, this expression gives a way to compute the degree of the canonical map ϕ in terms of the dimensions of the global sections of the canonical and anticanonical bundles on X and Y."
