    "message_2": "The surface area of a cone can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 6 cm and l = 10 cm.\n\nSurface Area = π(6)(6 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(6)(16)\nSurface Area = 96π\n\nNow, we can round the answer to the nearest hundredth:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 301.59 cm²"
