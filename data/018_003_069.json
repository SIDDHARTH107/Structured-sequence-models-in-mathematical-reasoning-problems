In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}.\n\nNow, let's show algebraically that the union of A and B is a superset of each individual set.\n\nA set X is a superset of set Y if every element of Y is also an element of X. In other words, if Y ⊆ X.\n\n1. We need to show that A ⊆ (A ∪ B):\n\nFor every element x in A, we need to show that x is also in A ∪ B. Let's check each element of A:\n\n- 1 ∈ A: Since 1 is in A, it is also in A ∪ B.\n- 2 ∈ A: Since 2 is in A and B, it is also in A ∪ B.\n- 3 ∈ A: Since 3 is in A, it is also in A ∪ B.\n\nSince every element of A is in A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ⊆ (A ∪ B).\n\n2.
