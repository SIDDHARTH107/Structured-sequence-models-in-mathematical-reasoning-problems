    "message_2": "To use the inverse matrix method, we first need to write the system of linear equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |\n    | 2  3  2 |\n    | 3  1  1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 6  |\n    | 16 |\n    | 13 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we will first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 1(3*1 - 2*1) - 1(2*1 - 2*1) + 1(2*1 - 3*1)\n       = 1(1) - 1(0) + 1(-1)\n       = 1 - 0 - 1\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the matrix A is singular, and it does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot use the inverse matrix method to solve this system of linear equations."
