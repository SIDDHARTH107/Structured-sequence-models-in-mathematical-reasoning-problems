    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with a 2x2 encryption matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the letters in the message to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25): M=12, A=0, T=19, H=7.\n2. Break the message into pairs of letters: (M, A) and (T, H).\n3. Represent each pair as a column vector: [12; 0] and [19; 7].\n4. Multiply each vector by the key matrix [5 7; 3 8].\n\nLet's perform the matrix multiplication:\n\nFor the first pair (M, A):\n[5 7; 3 8] * [12; 0] = [5*12 + 7*0; 3*12 + 8*0] = [60; 36]\n\nFor the second pair (T, H):\n[5 7; 3 8] * [19; 7] = [5*19 + 7*7; 3*19 + 8*7] = [168; 137]\n\n5. Convert the resulting vectors back to letters: [60; 36] corresponds to (O, L) and [168; 137] corresponds to (S, P) after taking the mod 26.\n6. Combine the encrypted letter pairs to form the encrypted message: \"OLSP\".\n\nSo, the encrypted message for \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with the key matrix [5 7; 3 8] is \"OLSP\"."
