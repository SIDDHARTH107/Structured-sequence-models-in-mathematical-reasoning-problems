    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 120 and 36 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform a series of divisions with remainder until the remainder is 0. Then, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder.\n\nStep 1:\nDivide 120 by 36:\n120 รท 36 = 3 with a remainder of 12\n\nStep 2:\nNow divide the previous divisor (36) by the remainder from the previous step (12):\n36 รท 12 = 3 with a remainder of 0\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder, which is 12, is the GCD of 120 and 36.\n\nSo, the GCD(120, 36) = 12."
