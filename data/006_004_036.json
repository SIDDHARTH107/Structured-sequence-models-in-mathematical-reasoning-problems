    "message_1": "A game involves rolling a fair six-sided die. If you roll a 4 or higher, you win. What is the probability of winning this game on a single roll?",
    "message_2": "There are 3 winning outcomes (rolling a 4, 5, or 6) and 6 possible outcomes in total (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). The probability of winning the game on a single roll is the ratio of winning outcomes to total outcomes:\n\nP(winning) = (number of winning outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game on a single roll is 1/2 or 50%."
