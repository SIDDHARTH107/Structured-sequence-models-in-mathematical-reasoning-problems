    "message_2": "First, we can find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients, which is 5. We can factor out the GCF from the polynomial:\n\n5(x^2 - 4x + 3).\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to 3 and add to -4. These numbers are -3 and -1. So, we can factor the quadratic expression as:\n\n5(x - 3)(x - 1).\n\nTherefore, the completely factored form of the polynomial 5x^2 - 20x + 15 is 5(x - 3)(x - 1)."
