    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 over the field ℤ11, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of points on the curve for each x-coordinate in the field ℤ11.\n2. Add 1 to the total number of points to account for the point at infinity.\n\nFor each x-coordinate in the field ℤ11, we will substitute the x-value into the equation y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 and check if there is a corresponding y-value in the field ℤ11.\n\n1. For x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 5*0 + 7 = 7\nThere are no y-values in ℤ11 that satisfy this equation.\n\n2. For x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 5*1 + 7 = 13 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\nThere are no y-values in ℤ11 that satisfy this equation.\n\n3. For x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 5*2 + 7 = 27 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\ny = 4, 7 (two points)\n\n4. For x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 5*3 + 7 = 61 ≡ 6 (mod 11)\nThere are no y-values in ℤ11 that satisfy this equation.\n\n5. For x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 5*4 + 7 = 103 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\ny = 2, 9 (two points)\n\n6. For x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 5*5 + 7 = 157 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\nThere are no y-values in ℤ11 that satisfy this equation.\n\n7. For x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 5*6 + 7 = 223 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\nThere are no y-values in ℤ11 that satisfy this equation.\n\n8. For x = 7:\ny^2 = 7^3 + 5*7 + 7 = 301 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\ny = 2, 9 (two points)\n\n9. For x = 8:\ny^2 = 8^3 + 5*8 + 7 = 391 ≡ 6 (mod 11)\nThere are no y-values in ℤ11 that satisfy this equation.\n\n10. For x = 9:\ny^2 = 9^3 + 5*9 + 7 = 493 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\ny = 3, 8 (two points)\n\n11. For x = 10:\ny^2 = 10^3 + 5*10 + 7 = 607 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\nThere are no y-values in ℤ11 that satisfy this equation.\n\nNow, we count the total number of points found:\n2 (for x = 2) + 2 (for x = 4) + 2 (for x = 7) + 2 (for x = 9) = 8 points\n\nFinally, we add 1 to account for the point at infinity:\n8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, the order of the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 over the field ℤ11 is 9."
