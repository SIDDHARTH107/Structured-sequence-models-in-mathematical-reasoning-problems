    "message_2": "In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the classification of closed two-dimensional manifolds embedded in it can be determined by the classification theorem for compact surfaces. According to this theorem, every compact, connected, and orientable 2-manifold (surface) can be classified into one of the following types:\n\n1. The sphere $S^2$: This is the simplest closed surface, which can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as the boundary of a solid ball.\n\n2. The connected sum of $g$ tori, denoted as $T^g$: This is a surface formed by taking the connected sum of $g$ tori (i.e., gluing together $g$ tori along small disks). For example, when $g=1$, we have a single torus, which can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as the boundary of a solid torus. As $g$ increases, we get more complicated surfaces, but they can still be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nEvery compact, connected, and non-orientable 2-manifold (surface) can be classified into one of the following types:\n\n1. The connected sum of $k$ projective planes, denoted as $\\mathbb{RP}^2\\#k$: This is a surface formed by taking the connected sum of $k$ projective planes (i.e., gluing together $k$ projective planes along small disks). For example, when $k=1$, we have a single projective plane, which can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as the boundary of a solid projective plane. As $k$ increases, we get more complicated surfaces, but they can still be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nIn summary, the classification of closed two-dimensional manifolds embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of:\n\n1. The sphere $S^2$.\n2. The connected sum of $g$ tori, $T^g$, for any non-negative integer $g$.\n3. The connected sum of $k$ projective planes, $\\mathbb{RP}^2\\#k$, for any positive integer $k$."
