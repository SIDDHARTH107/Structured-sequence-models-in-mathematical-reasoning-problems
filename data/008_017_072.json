    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n| 2  4  6 | |x|   |10|\n| 4  9 12 | |y| = |16|\n| 6 12 15 | |z|   |20|\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to simplify the matrix:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 | |x|   | 5|\n| 4  9 12 | |y| = |16|\n| 6 12 15 | |z|   |20|\n```\n\n2. Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 | |x|   | 5|\n| 0  1  0 | |y| = |-4|\n| 0  0 -3 | |z|   |-10|\n```\n\n3. Divide the third row by -3:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 | |x|   | 5|\n| 0  1  0 | |y| = |-4|\n| 0  0  1 | |z|   |10/3|\n```\n\n4. Subtract 3 times the third row from the first row:\n\n```\n| 1  2  0 | |x|   |-5/3|\n| 0  1  0 | |y| = |-4  |\n| 0  0  1 | |z|   |10/3|\n```\n\n5. Subtract 2 times the second row from the first row:\n\n```\n| 1  0  0 | |x|   | 3|\n| 0  1  0 | |y| = |-4|\n| 0  0  1 | |z|   |10/3|\n```\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = 3\ny = -4\nz = 10/3"
