Pair (1, 2): We can choose the open sets U = {1} and V = {1, 2, 3}. Since 1 ∈ U and 2 ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅, this pair satisfies the T1 separation axiom.\n\n2. Pair (1, 3): We can choose the open sets U = {1} and V = {1, 2, 3}. Since 1 ∈ U and 3 ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅, this pair satisfies the T1 separation axiom.\n\n3. Pair (1, 4): We can choose the open sets U = {1} and V = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Since 1 ∈ U and 4 ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅, this pair satisfies the T1 separation axiom.\n\nHowever, let's consider the pair (2, 3):\n\nThere is no open set U ∈ τ that contains 2 but not 3, and no open set V ∈ τ that contains 3 but not 2. Therefore, we cannot find disjoint open sets U and V such that 2 ∈ U and 3 ∈ V. Thus, this pair does not satisfy the T1 separation axiom.\n\nSince we found a pair of distinct points that do not satisfy the T1 separation axiom, the topological space (X, τ) does not satisfy the T1 separation axiom."
