    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 2xe^(-x^2), we'll use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nHere, f(x) = 2xe^(-x^2) and k is the frequency variable. Let's plug in f(x) into the definition and solve the integral:\n\nF(k) = ∫[2xe^(-x^2) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we'll use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = 2e^(-x^2) * e^(-2πikx) dx. Then, du = dx and v = ∫2e^(-x^2) * e^(-2πikx) dx.\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of v. To do this, we'll use a substitution. Let t = x^2, so dt = 2x dx. The integral becomes:\n\nv = ∫e^(-t) * e^(-2πik√t) dt/2, from 0 to ∞\n\nThis integral is not easy to solve analytically. However, we can express the result in terms of a special function called the Fourier transform of the Gaussian function. The Fourier transform of the Gaussian function is given by:\n\nG(k) = (1/√(4π)) * ∫e^(-t) * e^(-2πik√t) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nComparing this with our integral for v, we have:\n\nv = (1/2) * √(4π) * G(k)\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts:\n\nF(k) = uv - ∫v du, from -∞ to ∞\nF(k) = x * (1/2) * √(4π) * G(k) - ∫(1/2) * √(4π) * G(k) dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nThe first term, x * (1/2) * √(4π) * G(k), vanishes at both -∞ and ∞ because x goes to 0. So, we're left with:\n\nF(k) = - ∫(1/2) * √(4π) * G(k) dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can take the constants out of the integral:\n\nF(k) = - (1/2) * √(4π) * ∫G(k) dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral represents the Fourier transform of the Gaussian function, which is itself a Gaussian function. Therefore, the Fourier transform of f(x) = 2xe^(-x^2) is:\n\nF(k) = - (1/2) * √(4π) * G(k)\n\nwhere G(k) is the Fourier transform of the Gaussian function."
