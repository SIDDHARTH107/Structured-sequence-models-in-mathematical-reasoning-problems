    "message_2": "To prove that G is a cyclic group, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince G is a group of prime order p = 7, we know that |G| = 7, which means G has 7 elements. Let's denote these elements as {e, g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g1 ≠ e in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Since G has prime order 7, the possible orders of subgroups are 1 and 7. The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup {e}, so any non-identity element must generate a subgroup of order 7.\n\nLet H = ⟨g1⟩ be the subgroup generated by g1. Since g1 ≠ e, the order of H must be 7. This means that H = {e, g1, g1^2, g1^3, g1^4, g1^5, g1^6}. Notice that H has the same number of elements as G, and since G is a group, it must be closed under the group operation. Therefore, the elements of H must be the same as the elements of G.\n\nSo, we have shown that there exists an element g1 in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g1. This means that G is a cyclic group, as required."
