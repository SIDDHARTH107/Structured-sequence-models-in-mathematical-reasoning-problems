    "message_2": "Since P is a necessary condition for Q, Q can only be true when P is true. We know that P is true in 60% of the cases. However, we don't have information about the percentage of cases where Q is true when P is true. Let's assume that Q is true in x% of the cases when P is true.\n\nNow, Q is a necessary condition for R. This means that R can only be true when Q is true. Since Q is true in x% of the cases when P is true, R can be true in at most x% of the cases when P is true.\n\nSince P is true in 60% of the cases, R can be true in at most (60% * x%) of the cases. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact percentage of cases where R is true."
