    "message_2": "Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be the subgroups generated by $P_1$ and $P_2$, respectively. Let $G = G_1 \\cap G_2$ be the intersection of these subgroups. We want to find the order of $G$.\n\nSince $P_1$ and $P_2$ are points of finite order, there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $mP_1 = 0$ and $nP_2 = 0$, where $0$ denotes the identity element of the Abelian variety $E$. Let $d = \\gcd(m, n)$. \n\nNow, consider any element $Q \\in G$. Since $Q \\in G_1$ and $Q \\in G_2$, there exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $Q = aP_1$ and $Q = bP_2$. Then, we have $aP_1 = bP_2$. Multiplying both sides by $mn$, we get $(amn)P_1 = (bmn)P_2$. Since $mP_1 = 0$ and $nP_2 = 0$, we can rewrite this as $(adn)P_1 = (bdm)P_2$. \n\nNow, note that $d$ divides both $adn$ and $bdm$. Thus, we can write $adn = dk_1$ and $bdm = dk_2$ for some integers $k_1$ and $k_2$. Then, we have $(dk_1)P_1 = (dk_2)P_2$. Dividing both sides by $d$, we get $(k_1)P_1 = (k_2)P_2$. Since $P_1$ and $P_2$ have orders $m$ and $n$, respectively, it follows that $k_1$ is a multiple of $m$ and $k_2$ is a multiple of $n$. Therefore, $Q$ is a multiple of both $P_1$ and $P_2$, and hence, $Q$ is a multiple of their least common multiple, which is $\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)$.\n\nThis shows that every element of $G$ is a multiple of $\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)$. Conversely, any multiple of $\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)$ is clearly in both $G_1$ and $G_2$, and hence in $G$. Therefore, the order of $G$ is equal to the number of multiples of $\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)$ that are less than or equal to $\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)$, which is simply the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$, i.e., $|G| = \\gcd(m, n)$."
