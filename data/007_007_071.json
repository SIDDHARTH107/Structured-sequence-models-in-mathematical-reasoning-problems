    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x + 5y = 4\n\nNow, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 5, and express it as a linear combination of 3 and 5:\n\n3 * 2 + 5 * (-1) = 1\n\nSince the GCD of 3 and 5 is 1, and 1 divides 4, there exists a solution to the Diophantine equation. We can multiply the linear combination by 4 to get a particular solution:\n\n3 * (2 * 4) + 5 * (-1 * 4) = 4\n\n12x + (-20)y = 4\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x, y) = (1, -4). Now, we can find the general solution by adding multiples of the nullspace vector, which is the vector (5, 3):\n\nx = 1 + 5k\ny = -4 + 3k\n\nwhere k is an integer. This gives us all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation 9x + 15y = 12."
