    "message_2": "First, we will write the system of linear equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n[ 2  3 | 13 ]\n[ 4  6.1 | 27.1 ]\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to find the values of x and y.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n[ 1  1.5 | 6.5 ]\n[ 4  6.1 | 27.1 ]\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row to eliminate the x term in the second row:\n\n[ 1  1.5 | 6.5 ]\n[ 0  0.1 | 1.1 ]\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 0.1 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n[ 1  1.5 | 6.5 ]\n[ 0  1 | 11 ]\n\nStep 4: Replace the first row with the first row minus 1.5 times the second row to eliminate the y term in the first row:\n\n[ 1  0 | -10 ]\n[ 0  1 | 11 ]\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n[ 1  0 | -10 ]\n[ 0  1 | 11 ]\n\nFrom this matrix, we can read off the solutions for x and y:\n\nx = -10\ny = 11\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy the system of equations are x = -10 and y = 11."
