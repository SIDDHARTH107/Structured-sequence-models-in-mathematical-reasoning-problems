    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) with four affine transformations. The area of the fern after each iteration can be calculated using the areas of the individual fronds.\n\nThe largest frond is created by the first transformation, which has a scaling factor of 0.85 in both the x and y directions. The other three transformations have scaling factors of 0.2, 0.15, and 0.1 in the x direction and 0.26, 0.28, and 0.12 in the y direction, respectively.\n\nAfter the 7th iteration, the total area of the fern can be calculated as the sum of the areas of all the fronds created by each transformation. The area of the largest frond will be (0.85^7) times the area of the initial frond, and the total area will be the sum of the areas of all the fronds created by each transformation.\n\nThe ratio of the area of the largest frond to the total area of the fern after the 7th iteration can be calculated as:\n\nArea of largest frond / Total area = (0.85^7) / (0.85^7 + 0.2^7 + 0.15^7 + 0.1^7)\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nArea of largest frond / Total area = (0.2916) / (0.2916 + 0.000128 + 0.000017 + 0.0000001)\n\nArea of largest frond / Total area = 0.2916 / (0.2917451)\n\nArea of largest frond / Total area â‰ˆ 0.9995\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the ratio is approximately 1.00."
