    "message_2": "To find the most common letter in an English plaintext message encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a key of 18, we need to consider the frequency of letters in the English language. The most common letter in English is 'E'.\n\nA Caesar cipher shifts the letters by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. In this case, the key is 18, so we need to shift the letter 'E' 18 positions back in the alphabet.\n\nE -> D (1 shift)\nD -> C (2 shifts)\nC -> B (3 shifts)\nB -> A (4 shifts)\nA -> Z (5 shifts)\nZ -> Y (6 shifts)\nY -> X (7 shifts)\nX -> W (8 shifts)\nW -> V (9 shifts)\nV -> U (10 shifts)\nU -> T (11 shifts)\nT -> S (12 shifts)\nS -> R (13 shifts)\nR -> Q (14 shifts)\nQ -> P (15 shifts)\nP -> O (16 shifts)\nO -> N (17 shifts)\nN -> M (18 shifts)\n\nAfter 18 shifts, the letter 'E' becomes 'M'. Therefore, the most common letter in an English plaintext message encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a key of 18 would be 'M'."
