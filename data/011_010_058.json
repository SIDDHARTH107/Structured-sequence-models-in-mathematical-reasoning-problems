    "message_2": "To find the number of possible combinations, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (t-shirts), k is the number of items you want to choose (3 t-shirts), and ! denotes the factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number).\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and k = 3.\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(6, 3) = (720) / (6 × 6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo there are 20 possible combinations of t-shirts you can buy."
