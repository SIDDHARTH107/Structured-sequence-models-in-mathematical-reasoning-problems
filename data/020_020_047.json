The tank will have a square base and an open top, and the material for the sides and bottom of the tank cost $10 per square meter, while the material for the top of the tank costs $20 per square meter. Determine the dimensions of the tank that will minimize the cost of materials.\n\nHints:\n- Let x be the length of one side of the square base and y be the height of the tank.\n- Write an expression for the surface area of the tank in terms of x and y.\n- Use the fact that the tank will hold 1000 cubic meters of water to write an equation relating x and y.\n- Write the cost of materials for the tank in terms of x and y.\n- Use optimization techniques to find the dimensions of the tank that will minimize the cost of materials.",
