    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MISSISSIPPI\", we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset:\n\nNumber of arrangements = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of letters, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the counts of each distinct letter.\n\nIn this case, n = 11 (total letters), n1 = 4 (number of S's), n2 = 4 (number of I's), n3 = 2 (number of P's), and n4 = 1 (number of M's).\n\nNumber of arrangements = 11! / (4! * 4! * 2! * 1!)\n\n= 39,916,800 / (24 * 24 * 2 * 1)\n\n= 39,916,800 / 1,152\n\n= 34,650\n\nSo there are 34,650 ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MISSISSIPPI\" if all the letters are used exactly once."
