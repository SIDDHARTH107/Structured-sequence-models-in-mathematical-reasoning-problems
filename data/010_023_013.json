    "message_2": "The knot shown in the image is a trefoil knot, which is the simplest nontrivial knot. The minimum number of crossings required to unknot the trefoil knot is 3. This is because the trefoil knot has a crossing number of 3, meaning it cannot be simplified to have fewer than 3 crossings. To unknot the trefoil knot, you would need to remove all 3 crossings."
