    "message_2": "A smooth map is a function that has continuous derivatives of all orders. To determine if the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4 is a smooth map on the interval [1, 4], we need to check if its derivatives are continuous on this interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 3x + 4) = 2x - 3\n\nNow let's find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (2x - 3) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is a constant, all higher-order derivatives will be zero:\n\nf'''(x) = f''''(x) = ... = 0\n\nAll the derivatives (f'(x), f''(x), f'''(x), ...) are continuous functions on the interval [1, 4]. Therefore, the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4 is a smooth map on the interval [1, 4]."
