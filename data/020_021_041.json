The company has 40 hours available for production per day. The time needed for each unit of product in each stage is as follows:\n\nStage 1: 4 hours per unit\nStage 2: 5 hours per unit\nStage 3: 3 hours per unit\n\nWhat is the minimum number of days required to produce 500 units of the product?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of days required to produce 500 units of the product, we first need to determine the total time needed to produce one unit of the product.\n\nTotal time for one unit = Stage 1 time + Stage 2 time + Stage 3 time\nTotal time for one unit = 4 hours + 5 hours + 3 hours = 12 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the total time required to produce 500 units.\n\nTotal time for 500 units = 500 units * 12 hours per unit = 6000 hours\n\nThe company has 40 hours available for production per day. To find the minimum number of days required, we will divide the total time needed by the available hours per day.\n\nMinimum number of days = Total time for 500 units / Available hours per day\nMinimum number of days = 6000 hours / 40 hours per day = 150 days\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of days required to produce 500 units of the product is 150 days."
