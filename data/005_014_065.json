    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to factor analysis:\n\nA researcher wants to investigate whether there are underlying factors that explain the scores on four tests: math, science, English, and history. She collected scores for 100 students and conducted a principal component analysis on the data. The results showed that the first two principal components explained 70% of the total variation in the data.\n\na) How many factors are likely to be underlying the test scores according to this analysis?\n\nb) What percentage of the total variation is explained by the first principal component?\n\nc) Which test has the highest loading on the first principal component?\n\nd) Suppose the researcher decides to retain only the first principal component. She wants to create a composite score that combines the four test scores weighted by their factor loadings on the first principal component. What would be the composite score for a student who scored 80 in math, 70 in science, 85 in English, and 75 in history?",
    "message_2": "a) Since the first two principal components explain 70% of the total variation in the data, it is likely that there are 2 underlying factors that explain the test scores according to this analysis.\n\nb) To determine the percentage of the total variation explained by the first principal component, we would need more information about the individual contributions of the first and second principal components. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem.\n\nc) We cannot determine which test has the highest loading on the first principal component without more information about the factor loadings for each test.\n\nd) To calculate the composite score for a student who scored 80 in math, 70 in science, 85 in English, and 75 in history, we would need the factor loadings for each test on the first principal component. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem. If we had the factor loadings, we would multiply each test score by its respective factor loading and sum the results to obtain the composite score."
