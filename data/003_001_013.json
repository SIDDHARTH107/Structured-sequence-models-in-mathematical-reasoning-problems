    "message_2": "To find how far up the wall the ladder reaches, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function relates the ratio of the opposite side (the height up the wall) to the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder) in a right triangle.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees, and the hypotenuse (the ladder) is 5 meters long. We want to find the opposite side (the height up the wall).\n\nsin(60) = height / 5\n\nTo find the sine of 60 degrees, we can use a calculator or remember the value from the unit circle. sin(60) = √3/2.\n\n(√3/2) = height / 5\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 5 * (√3/2)\n\nheight ≈ 4.33 meters\n\nSo, the ladder reaches approximately 4.33 meters up the wall."
