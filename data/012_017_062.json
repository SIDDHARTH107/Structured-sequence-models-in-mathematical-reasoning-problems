    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In this graph, there are 5 vertices, which means a perfect matching is not possible because there will always be one vertex left unconnected (since perfect matching requires an even number of vertices).\n\nHowever, we can find a maximum matching, which is a set of edges with the maximum possible number of vertices connected without sharing any vertex. In this case, we can choose the following edges:\n\n1. A-B with a weight of 2\n2. C-D with a weight of 3\n\nThis maximum matching connects 4 out of the 5 vertices, and its total weight is 2 + 3 = 5."
