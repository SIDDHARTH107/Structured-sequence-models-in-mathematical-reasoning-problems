    "message_2": "To find the even integers between 50 and 70 that can be written as the sum of two prime numbers, we can use the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Let's check the even integers between 50 and 70:\n\n1. 50 = 3 + 47 (both are prime numbers)\n2. 52 = 5 + 47 (both are prime numbers)\n3. 54 = 7 + 47 (both are prime numbers)\n4. 56 = 3 + 53 (both are prime numbers)\n5. 58 = 5 + 53 (both are prime numbers)\n6. 60 = 7 + 53 (both are prime numbers)\n7. 62 = 13 + 49 (49 is not a prime number, so we need to find another pair)\n   62 = 31 + 31 (both are prime numbers)\n8. 64 = 3 + 61 (both are prime numbers)\n9. 66 = 5 + 61 (both are prime numbers)\n10. 68 = 7 + 61 (both are prime numbers)\n11. 70 = 3 + 67 (both are prime numbers)\n\nAll the even integers between 50 and 70 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers."
