    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, and it is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\n$H(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_1^2 + p_2^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(q_1^2 + q_2^2) + \\alpha q_1^2 q_2 - \\frac{\\beta}{3}q_2^3$\n\nwhere $q_1$, $q_2$, $p_1$, and $p_2$ are the generalized coordinates and momenta, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the parameters of the system.\n\nThe largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions, and it is used to characterize the chaotic behavior of the system. The LLE is typically computed numerically, as there is no general analytical expression for it.\n\nFor the Henon-Heiles system with parameter values $\\alpha=1/2$ and $\\beta=1/3$, the LLE has been computed numerically in various studies. However, the exact value of the LLE depends on the initial conditions and the energy level of the system.\n\nTherefore, without specifying the initial conditions and energy level, it is not possible to provide a specific value for the largest Lyapunov exponent."
