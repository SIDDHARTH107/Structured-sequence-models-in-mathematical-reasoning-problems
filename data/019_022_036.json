    "message_1": "A student is a college choosing between two courses: Calculus and Statistics. The student thinks there is a 70% chance they will enjoy Calculus and a 90% chance they will enjoy Statistics. Based on their enjoyment, there is a 60% chance they will get an A in Calculus and a 75% chance they will get an A in Statistics. If the student wants the best chance of getting an A in their chosen course, which course should they choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which course the student should choose, we need to calculate the probability of getting an A in each course based on their enjoyment. We can do this by multiplying the probability of enjoying the course by the probability of getting an A given their enjoyment.\n\nFor Calculus:\nProbability of enjoying Calculus = 0.7\nProbability of getting an A in Calculus given enjoyment = 0.6\nProbability of getting an A in Calculus = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42\n\nFor Statistics:\nProbability of enjoying Statistics = 0.9\nProbability of getting an A in Statistics given enjoyment = 0.75\nProbability of getting an A in Statistics = 0.9 * 0.75 = 0.675\n\nSince the probability of getting an A in Statistics (0.675) is higher than the probability of getting an A in Calculus (0.42), the student should choose the Statistics course for the best chance of getting an A."
