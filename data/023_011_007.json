    "message_1": "A company produces a soundproof wall that is 3 meters high and 5 meters long. The soundproofing material used in the wall has an absorption coefficient of 0.8 at 150 Hz. What is the total absorption of the soundproofing material at that frequency in square meters? Use the Fourier transform to analyze the behavior of the sound waves in the room.",
    "message_2": "To find the total absorption of the soundproofing material at 150 Hz, we first need to calculate the surface area of the wall. The surface area can be found by multiplying the height and length of the wall:\n\nSurface area = height × length\nSurface area = 3 meters × 5 meters\nSurface area = 15 square meters\n\nNow, we can find the total absorption by multiplying the surface area by the absorption coefficient:\n\nTotal absorption = surface area × absorption coefficient\nTotal absorption = 15 square meters × 0.8\nTotal absorption = 12 square meters\n\nTo analyze the behavior of the sound waves in the room using the Fourier transform, we would need more information about the room's dimensions, the location of the sound source, and the frequency content of the sound. The Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that can be used to analyze the frequency content of a signal, such as a sound wave. In this context, it would help us understand how the sound waves interact with the soundproof wall and other surfaces in the room, and how the absorption properties of the wall affect the overall sound environment.\n\nHowever, without more information about the room and the sound source, we cannot perform a detailed analysis using the Fourier transform."
