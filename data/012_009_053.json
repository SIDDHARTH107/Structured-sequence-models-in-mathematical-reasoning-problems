    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G with 7 vertices and degree sequence {4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1} can be connected, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the properties of connected graphs.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15. Since 15 is an odd number, it is not possible for the graph to satisfy the Handshaking Lemma, as the sum of degrees should be an even number (twice the number of edges).\n\nHowever, let's further investigate the connectivity of the graph. A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices. In a connected graph with 7 vertices, the minimum degree of a vertex should be at least 1, which is satisfied in this case.\n\nNow, let's try to construct the graph with the given degree sequence:\n\n1. Vertex A has a degree of 4, so it connects to vertices B, C, D, and E.\n2. Vertex B has a degree of 3, and it's already connected to A, so it connects to vertices F and G.\n3. Vertex C has a degree of 3, and it's already connected to A, so it connects to vertices F and G.\n4. Vertex D has a degree of 2, and it's already connected to A, so it connects to either F or G (let's say F).\n5. Vertex E has a degree of 1, and it's already connected to A.\n6. Vertex F has a degree of 1, and it's already connected to B, C, and D.\n7. Vertex G has a degree of 1, and it's already connected to B and C.\n\nThe constructed graph is connected, as there is a path between every pair of vertices. So, despite the sum of degrees being odd, the graph with the given degree sequence can be connected."
