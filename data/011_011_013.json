    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 identical balls to be distributed into 3 distinct boxes. In how many ways can we distribute the balls such that each box has at least one ball?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the stars and bars method. Since each box must have at least one ball, we can first place one ball in each box. Now, we have 7 balls left to distribute among the 3 boxes.\n\nWe can think of this as placing 2 dividers among the 7 remaining balls. For example, if we have the arrangement:\n\nBall Ball | Ball Ball Ball | Ball Ball\n\nThis represents placing 2 balls in the first box, 3 balls in the second box, and 2 balls in the third box.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of ways to place 2 dividers among the 7 balls. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of the 7 + 2 = 9 positions (7 balls and 2 dividers).\n\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 9 and k = 2:\n\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9-2)!) = 9! / (2!7!) = (9 * 8) / (2 * 1) = 36\n\nSo, there are 36 ways to distribute the 10 identical balls into the 3 distinct boxes such that each box has at least one ball."
