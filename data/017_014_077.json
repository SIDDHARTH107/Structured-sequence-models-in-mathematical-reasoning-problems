    "message_2": "To find the distinct non-abelian groups of order 20, we first note that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of a group G is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5. Therefore, we need to find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 5. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, we consider the cases for n_2:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, which must be normal in G. Since n_5 = 1, there is also a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, which must be normal in G. In this case, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are C4 and C5. The direct product of C4 and C5 is C20, which is abelian. This case does not give us a non-abelian group.\n\n2. If n_2 = 5, then there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4. Since n_5 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, which must be normal in G. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, PQ is a subgroup of G with order 20. Thus, G is isomorphic to the semi-direct product of P and Q.\n\nThe Sylow 2-subgroup P can be either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If P is C4, then there is only one possible semi-direct product, which is the dihedral group D10. However, D10 is non-abelian, so this is one possible non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nIf P is V4, then there is only one possible semi-direct product, which is the group G = V4 ⋊ C5. This group is non-abelian and not isomorphic to D10. To see this, note that D10 has an element of order 10 (a rotation), while G does not. Thus, there are two distinct non-abelian groups of order 20: D10 and V4 ⋊ C5.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two distinct non-abelian groups of order 20: the dihedral group D10 and the semi-direct product V4 ⋊ C5. Neither of these groups is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, as they are both non-abelian, while C20 is abelian."
