    "message_2": "To determine which of the following groups of order 120 are isomorphic, we will analyze their properties and structures.\n\n1. C120: This is the cyclic group of order 120. It is abelian, and its structure is simple, with one element generating the entire group.\n\n2. A5 × C2 × C2: This group is a direct product of the alternating group A5 (order 60) and two cyclic groups C2 (order 2). A5 is non-abelian, while C2 and C2 are abelian. The direct product of these groups will be non-abelian as well. The structure of this group is more complex than C120.\n\nNow, let's analyze the first four non-abelian groups of order 120, G1 to G4. Since they are non-abelian, they cannot be isomorphic to C120, which is abelian. We will focus on comparing them to A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nG1, G2, G3, and G4 are non-abelian groups of order 120. To determine if any of them are isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2, we need to look at their properties and structures. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze their structures.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups in a group of order 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 must satisfy certain conditions:\n\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 15 (3 * 5) and be congruent to 1 mod 2.\n- The number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 40 (2^3 * 5) and be congruent to 1 mod 3.\n- The number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 24 (2^3 * 3) and be congruent to 1 mod 5.\n\nFor A5 × C2 × C2, we have:\n\n- One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 (C2 × C2 × C2).\n- One Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3 (A5 has one Sylow 3-subgroup).\n- One Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5 (A5 has one Sylow 5-subgroup).\n\nNow, we need to analyze the Sylow subgroups of G1, G2, G3, and G4. If any of these groups have the same number of Sylow subgroups as A5 × C2 × C2, they might be isomorphic.\n\nAfter analyzing the Sylow subgroups of G1, G2, G3, and G4, we find that none of them have the same number of Sylow subgroups as A5 × C2 × C2. Therefore, none of the first four non-abelian groups of order 120 are isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the given groups (C120, A5 × C2 × C2, G1, G2, G3, and G4) are isomorphic to each other."
