    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference (△) of (A × B) and B:\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} △ {2, 3}\n\nSince the elements of B are not ordered pairs, they cannot be directly compared with the elements of (A × B). Therefore, the symmetric difference remains the same as (A × B):\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of B with itself:\n\nB △ B = {2, 3} △ {2, 3} = {}\n\nSince the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set, we have:\n\nB △ B = {}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product A × (B △ B):\n\nA × (B △ B) = A × {} = {}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) △ B ≠ A × (B △ B) because:\n\n{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} ≠ {}\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
