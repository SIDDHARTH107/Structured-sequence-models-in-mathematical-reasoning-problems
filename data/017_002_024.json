    "message_2": "First, let's understand the elements of the group G. Since G is a cyclic group generated by 8, it means that every element in G can be written as a power of 8. So, the elements of G are of the form {8^0, 8^1, 8^2, ...}.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H = {1, 8, 64}. We can rewrite the elements of H in terms of powers of 8:\n\n1 = 8^0\n8 = 8^1\n64 = 8^2\n\nSince all the elements of H can be written as powers of 8, H is a subgroup of G. Now, we need to determine if H is cyclic.\n\nA group is cyclic if there exists an element in the group that generates the entire group. In other words, if there exists an element h in H such that every element in H can be written as a power of h, then H is cyclic.\n\nLet's check if any of the elements in H can generate the entire group H:\n\n1. For h = 1 (8^0):\n1^1 = 1\n1^2 = 1\n1^3 = 1\nWe can see that 1 cannot generate the entire group H, as it only generates the element 1.\n\n2. For h = 8 (8^1):\n8^1 = 8\n8^2 = 64\n8^3 = 512 (which is not in H)\nWe can see that 8 can generate the entire group H, as it generates all the elements {1, 8, 64}.\n\nSince we found an element (8) that can generate the entire group H, we can conclude that H is a cyclic subgroup of G."
