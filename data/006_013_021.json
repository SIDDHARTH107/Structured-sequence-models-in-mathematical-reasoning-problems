    "message_1": "What is the probability of a major earthquake (magnitude 7.0 or higher) occurring in a particular region in the next 30 years, given that the historical probability of such occurrences is 0.5% per year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. Instead of directly calculating the probability of a major earthquake occurring in the next 30 years, we can calculate the probability of no major earthquake occurring in the next 30 years and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least one major earthquake occurring.\n\nThe probability of no major earthquake occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.005 = 0.995.\n\nFor 30 years, the probability of no major earthquake occurring in any of those years is (0.995)^30.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one major earthquake occurring in the next 30 years:\n\n1 - (0.995)^30 â‰ˆ 0.1394\n\nSo, the probability of a major earthquake (magnitude 7.0 or higher) occurring in the particular region in the next 30 years is approximately 13.94%."
