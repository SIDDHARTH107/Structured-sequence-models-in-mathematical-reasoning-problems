    "message_2": "To find the value of the Riemann theta function for this genus 2 hyperelliptic curve, we first need to compute the Riemann matrix (also known as the period matrix) associated with the curve. The Riemann matrix is a 2x2 symmetric matrix with complex entries, which can be computed using the Abel-Jacobi map and the integration of holomorphic differentials over a basis of cycles on the curve.\n\nHowever, computing the Riemann matrix for a specific curve is a highly non-trivial task and usually requires numerical methods or specialized software. Once the Riemann matrix is obtained, we can compute the Riemann theta function using the following formula:\n\nθ(z; Ω) = ∑ exp(πi (n + z) Ω (n + z)^T + 2πi (n + z) z^T),\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all integer vectors n in Z^2, z is a complex vector, and Ω is the Riemann matrix.\n\nGiven the complexity of this problem and the lack of specific numerical values for the Riemann matrix, it is not possible to provide an explicit complex number as the value of the Riemann theta function for this curve. The solution would require specialized software and numerical methods to compute the Riemann matrix and evaluate the Riemann theta function."
