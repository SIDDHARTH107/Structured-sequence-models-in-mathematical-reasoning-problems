    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that consists of a square divided into 9 smaller squares, with the central square removed. In each subsequent iteration, the same process is applied to the remaining 8 squares.\n\nTo find the number of squares in the 4th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 4th iteration:\n\nNumber of squares = (8^4 - 1) / 7\nNumber of squares = (4096 - 1) / 7\nNumber of squares = 4095 / 7\nNumber of squares = 585\n\nSo, there are 585 squares in the 4th iteration of the Sierpinski carpet fractal."
