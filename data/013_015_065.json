    "message_1": "Suppose that there is a principal who wants to hire an agent to sell a particular product. The principal can only observe the outcome of the sales, but not the effort that the agent exerts. The outcome of the sales depends on the effort that the agent exerts, with an unknown probability function. The principal can offer a fixed salary of $2000 or a 20% commission on sales. The agent has two effort levels: Low and High. If the agent chooses low effort level, the probability of selling the product is 0.2, and if the agent chooses high effort level, the probability of selling the product is 0.8. The product is priced at $100 for each unit sold. Which effort level should the agent choose to maximize his or her expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "To determine which effort level the agent should choose to maximize their expected payoff, we need to calculate the expected payoff for each effort level under both the fixed salary and commission payment schemes.\n\n1. Fixed salary of $2000:\n\na) Low effort level:\nThe agent's payoff is fixed at $2000 regardless of the number of products sold.\n\nb) High effort level:\nSimilarly, the agent's payoff is fixed at $2000 regardless of the number of products sold.\n\n2. 20% commission on sales:\n\na) Low effort level:\nThe agent has a 0.2 probability of selling the product. If the product is sold, the agent earns a 20% commission, which is $20 (0.2 * $100). The expected payoff for the agent is 0.2 * $20 = $4 per product.\n\nb) High effort level:\nThe agent has a 0.8 probability of selling the product. If the product is sold, the agent earns a 20% commission, which is $20 (0.2 * $100). The expected payoff for the agent is 0.8 * $20 = $16 per product.\n\nNow, let's compare the expected payoffs:\n\n1. Fixed salary:\nBoth low and high effort levels result in a payoff of $2000.\n\n2. 20% commission on sales:\nLow effort level results in an expected payoff of $4 per product, while high effort level results in an expected payoff of $16 per product.\n\nTo maximize their expected payoff, the agent should choose the high effort level when offered a 20% commission on sales. However, the agent must also consider the number of products they expect to sell. If the agent expects to sell more than 100 products (since $2000 / $20 = 100), they should choose the 20% commission with high effort level. If they expect to sell fewer than 100 products, the fixed salary would be more beneficial."
