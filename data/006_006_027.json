    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the free throw accuracy rate)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of free throw shots)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (in this case, making exactly 6 shots)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 8 (the number of free throw shots)\n- k = 6 (the number of successful shots we want to find the probability for)\n- p = 0.75 (the free throw accuracy rate)\n\nFirst, let's find nCk (8 choose 6):\n8! / (6!(8-6)!) = 8! / (6!2!) = (8*7*6!)/(6!*2) = 28\n\nNow, let's find p^k:\n0.75^6 ≈ 0.178\n\nNext, let's find (1-p)^(n-k):\n(1-0.75)^(8-6) = 0.25^2 = 0.0625\n\nFinally, let's plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\nP(X = 6) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k) = 28 * 0.178 * 0.0625 ≈ 0.311\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player will make exactly 6 of the 8 free throw shots is approximately 31.1%."
