    "message_1": "Suppose Company A and Company B are the only producers of a certain type of goods in the market. Their cost functions are given by:\n\nC_A = 50 + 2Q_A\nC_B = 60 + Q_B\n\nwhere Q_A and Q_B are their respective quantities produced. If the market demand for this good is:\n\nQ_D = 150 - 3P\n\nwhere P is the price of the good, what will be the Nash equilibrium quantity produced by each company in a Cournot competition?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium in a Cournot competition, we first need to derive the reaction functions for both companies. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity a company should produce given the quantity produced by the other company.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse demand function by solving the demand function for P:\n\nQ_D = 150 - 3P\n3P = 150 - Q_D\nP = (150 - Q_D) / 3\n\nSince Q_D = Q_A + Q_B, we can rewrite the price function as:\n\nP = (150 - (Q_A + Q_B)) / 3\n\nNow, we need to find the profit functions for both companies. Profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost:\n\nΠ_A = P * Q_A - C_A\nΠ_B = P * Q_B - C_B\n\nSubstitute the price function and cost functions into the profit functions:\n\nΠ_A = ((150 - (Q_A + Q_B)) / 3) * Q_A - (50 + 2Q_A)\nΠ_B = ((150 - (Q_A + Q_B)) / 3) * Q_B - (60 + Q_B)\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order conditions by taking the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to the respective quantities:\n\n∂Π_A / ∂Q_A = 50 - 2Q_A - Q_B\n∂Π_B / ∂Q_B = 50 - Q_A - 2Q_B\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the Nash equilibrium quantities:\n\n50 - 2Q_A - Q_B = 0\n50 - Q_A - 2Q_B = 0\n\nSolving for Q_A in the first equation:\n\n2Q_A + Q_B = 50\nQ_A = (50 - Q_B) / 2\n\nSubstitute this expression for Q_A into the second equation:\n\n50 - (50 - Q_B) / 2 - 2Q_B = 0\n\nSimplify and solve for Q_B:\n\n50 - 25 + Q_B / 2 - 2Q_B = 0\n25 + Q_B / 2 = 2Q_B\nQ_B = 25\n\nNow, substitute Q_B back into the expression for Q_A:\n\nQ_A = (50 - 25) / 2\nQ_A = 25 / 2\nQ_A = 12.5\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium quantities in this Cournot competition are Q_A = 12.5 and Q_B = 25."
