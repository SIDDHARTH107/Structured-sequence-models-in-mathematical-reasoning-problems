    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, which is a prime power (3^3), we know that G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides the order of G. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, which we will denote by P.\n\nNow, let's consider the center of G, denoted by Z(G). Since G is a p-group, we know that Z(G) is nontrivial (i.e., it contains more than just the identity element). Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: |Z(G)| = 3\nIn this case, Z(G) is a normal subgroup of G, and we can form the quotient group G/Z(G). The order of G/Z(G) is 27/3 = 9. Since 9 is a prime power (3^2), G/Z(G) is also a p-group, and by the same argument as before, its center is nontrivial. However, since the order of G/Z(G) is 9, its center must be the whole group, which means G/Z(G) is abelian. Therefore, G/Z(G) is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C_9, C_3 × C_3, where C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n.\n\nNow, we can use the correspondence theorem to find subgroups of G that contain Z(G) and have order 9. If G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C_9, then G has a subgroup of order 9 that contains Z(G), and G is isomorphic to the direct product of this subgroup and Z(G), which is a cyclic group of order 3. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIf G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3, then G has two subgroups of order 9 that contain Z(G), and G is isomorphic to the direct product of one of these subgroups and Z(G). In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: |Z(G)| = 9\nIn this case, Z(G) is a normal subgroup of G with order 9, which means Z(G) is isomorphic to C_9 or C_3 × C_3. If Z(G) is isomorphic to C_9, then G is a cyclic group of order 27, since any element of order 9 in Z(G) will generate a cyclic subgroup of order 27 in G.\n\nIf Z(G) is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of Z(G) and a cyclic group of order 3 (since the order of G is 27). In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is cyclic, or G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
