    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(ω) of the signal f(t) = cos(5πt) + 2sin(10πt), we will use the given formula:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[0,1] f(t) exp(-2πiωt) dt\n\nFirst, we will break the integral into two parts, one for each term in the signal:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[0,1] (cos(5πt) exp(-2πiωt) + 2sin(10πt) exp(-2πiωt)) dt\n\nNow, we will solve each integral separately:\n\n∫[0,1] cos(5πt) exp(-2πiωt) dt:\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = cos(5πt) and dv = exp(-2πiωt) dt. Then, du = -5πsin(5πt) dt and v = (-1/(2πiω))exp(-2πiωt).\n\nApplying integration by parts formula:\n\nuv - ∫v du = (-1/(2πiω))cos(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) |[0,1] + (5π/(2πiω))∫[0,1] sin(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) dt\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\n∫[0,1] sin(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) dt\n\nAgain, using integration by parts, let u = sin(5πt) and dv = exp(-2πiωt) dt. Then, du = 5πcos(5πt) dt and v = (-1/(2πiω))exp(-2πiωt).\n\nApplying integration by parts formula:\n\nuv - ∫v du = (-1/(2πiω))sin(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) |[0,1] - (5π/(2πiω))∫[0,1] cos(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) dt\n\nNotice that the remaining integral is the same as the one we started with. Let's call it I:\n\nI = (-1/(2πiω))sin(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) |[0,1] - (5π/(2πiω))I\n\nNow, we can solve for I:\n\nI(1 + 5π/(2πiω)) = (-1/(2πiω))sin(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) |[0,1]\n\nI = (-1/(2πiω(1 + 5π/(2πiω))))sin(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) |[0,1]\n\nNow, we will solve the second integral:\n\n∫[0,1] 2sin(10πt) exp(-2πiωt) dt\n\nUsing a similar process as before, we get:\n\nI2 = (-1/(5πiω(1 - 10π/(5πiω))))sin(10πt)exp(-2πiωt) |[0,1]\n\nFinally, we combine the results of both integrals:\n\nF(ω) = I + I2\n\nF(ω) = (-1/(2πiω(1 + 5π/(2πiω))))sin(5πt)exp(-2πiωt) |[0,1] + (-1/(5πiω(1 - 10π/(5πiω))))sin(10πt)exp(-2πiωt) |[0,1]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform F(ω) of the given signal f(t) = cos(5πt) + 2sin(10πt)."
