    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products A and B, which require 2 and 3 resources respectively. The company has 600 units of resource 1, 900 units of resource 2, and 1200 units of resource 3. Product A sells for $10 per unit and product B sells for $20 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are as follows:\n\nResource 1: 2x + 3y ≤ 600\nResource 2: x + y ≤ 900\nResource 3: 2x + y ≤ 1200\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 20y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 600\n   y ≤ (600 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. x + y ≤ 900\n   y ≤ 900 - x\n\n3. 2x + y ≤ 1200\n   y ≤ 1200 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. We will find these intersection points:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n2x + 3y = 600\nx + y = 900\n\nSolving the system of equations, we get:\nx = 300\ny = 600 - 2x = 600 - 2(300) = 0\n\nIntersection point (300, 0)\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 3:\n2x + 3y = 600\n2x + y = 1200\n\nSolving the system of equations, we get:\ny = 1200 - 2x\n2x + 3(1200 - 2x) = 600\n2x + 3600 - 6x = 600\n4x = 3000\nx = 750\n\ny = 1200 - 2x = 1200 - 2(750) = -300 (This is not possible since y must be non-negative)\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and 3:\nx + y = 900\n2x + y = 1200\n\nSolving the system of equations, we get:\ny = 900 - x\n2x + (900 - x) = 1200\nx = 300\n\ny = 900 - x = 900 - 300 = 600\n\nIntersection point (300, 600)\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 0): Profit = 10(0) + 20(0) = $0\n2. (300, 0): Profit = 10(300) + 20(0) = $3000\n3. (300, 600): Profit = 10(300) + 20(600) = $3000 + $12000 = $15000\n\nThe maximum profit is $15,000, which occurs when the company produces 300 units of product A and 600 units of product B."
