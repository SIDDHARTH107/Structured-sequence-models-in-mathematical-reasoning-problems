    "message_1": "Suppose you have a message consisting of 50 characters and you want to create a hash value of 128 bits using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. What is the maximum number of different messages that can have the same hash value?",
    "message_2": "The SHA-256 cryptographic hash function generates a fixed-size output of 256 bits, not 128 bits as mentioned in the question. Assuming the question meant to ask about SHA-256, I will proceed with the answer.\n\nA hash function like SHA-256 maps an input (in this case, a message) to a fixed-size output (256 bits). Since the output size is fixed, there is a finite number of possible hash values. For a 256-bit hash, there are 2^256 possible hash values.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the maximum number of different messages that can have the same hash value. This is essentially asking about the probability of a hash collision, which occurs when two different messages have the same hash value.\n\nThe maximum number of different messages that can have the same hash value can be estimated using the Birthday Paradox. The Birthday Paradox states that in a set of N randomly chosen items, the probability of a pair of items being identical is approximately 50% when N is approximately equal to the square root of the total number of possible items.\n\nIn the case of a 256-bit hash, there are 2^256 possible hash values. The square root of 2^256 is 2^(256/2) = 2^128. Therefore, when there are approximately 2^128 different messages, there is a 50% probability of a hash collision occurring.\n\nSo, the maximum number of different messages that can have the same hash value is approximately 2^128."
