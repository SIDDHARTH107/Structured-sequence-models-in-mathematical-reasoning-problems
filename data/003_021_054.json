    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nTwo vectors A and B have magnitudes of 3 and 5, respectively. The angle between them is 60 degrees. Using trigonometry, find the cosine of the angle between A and B.",
    "message_2": "To find the cosine of the angle between two vectors A and B, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nA • B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere A • B is the dot product of the two vectors, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n|A| = 3\n|B| = 5\nθ = 60 degrees\n\nWe want to find cos(θ). Since we already know the angle (60 degrees), we can directly find the cosine of the angle using a calculator or a trigonometric table.\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5\n\nSo, the cosine of the angle between vectors A and B is 0.5."
