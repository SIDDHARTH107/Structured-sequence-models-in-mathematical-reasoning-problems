    "message_1": "Suppose that a set of 50 test scores has a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 5. If a student scores 90 on the test, is this score considered an outlier? Use the 3-sigma rule to determine if the score is an outlier.",
    "message_2": "The 3-sigma rule states that approximately 99.7% of the data points in a normal distribution lie within three standard deviations of the mean. In this case, the mean is 70 and the standard deviation is 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the range within which 99.7% of the data points lie:\n\nMean - 3 * Standard Deviation = 70 - 3 * 5 = 70 - 15 = 55\nMean + 3 * Standard Deviation = 70 + 3 * 5 = 70 + 15 = 85\n\nSo, according to the 3-sigma rule, 99.7% of the test scores should lie between 55 and 85.\n\nThe student's score is 90, which is outside of this range (greater than 85). Therefore, the score of 90 can be considered an outlier."
