    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we can analyze the given presentation and compare it to the presentations of C20, D10, and the non-abelian group of order 20.\n\n1. Cyclic group C20: The cyclic group of order 20 has a single generator, say c, and its presentation is <c | c^20 = 1>. Since G has two generators, a and b, it cannot be isomorphic to C20.\n\n2. Dihedral group D10: The dihedral group of order 20 (D10) has a presentation <x, y | x^10 = y^2 = 1, yx = x^9y>. Comparing this to the presentation of G, we can see that a^4 = x^10 and b^5 = y^2. However, the relation ba = a^3b does not match the relation yx = x^9y. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to D10.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 20: The non-abelian group of order 20 has a presentation <a, b | a^4 = b^5 = 1, ba = a^3b>. This presentation matches the presentation of G exactly.\n\nThus, the group G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20."
