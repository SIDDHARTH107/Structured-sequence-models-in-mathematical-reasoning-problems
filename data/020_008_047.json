The costs of shipping a package from each warehouse to each destination are given by the following table:\n\n|     | Dest1 | Dest2 | Dest3 | Dest4 | Dest5 | Dest6 | Dest7 | Dest8 |\n| --- | ---   | ---   | ---   | ---   | ---   | ---   | ---   | ---   |\n| Wh1 |  22   |  15   |  35   |  18   |  28   |  12   |  25   |  10   |\n| Wh2 |  12   |  25   |  27   |  13   |  19   |  34   |  21   |  16   |\n| Wh3 |  30   |  19   |  14   |  28   |  20   |  17   |  23   |  11   |\n| Wh4 |  19   |  24   |  26   |  11   |  15   |  22   |  13   |  18   |\n| Wh5 |  31   |  28   |  27   |  33   |  24   |  16   |  22   |  18   |\n\nThe company wants to determine the optimal shipping plan to minimize costs. How many packages should be shipped from each warehouse to each destination to minimize total cost? What is the minimum total cost of shipping?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using linear programming techniques, specifically the transportation problem. To find the optimal shipping plan, we need to minimize the total cost of shipping packages from warehouses to destinations. Let x[i][j] represent the number of packages shipped from warehouse i to destination j.\n\nObjective function: Minimize the total cost = sum(x[i][j] * cost[i][j]) for all i and j.\n\nConstraints:\n1. The number of packages shipped from each warehouse should be non-negative: x[i][j] >= 0 for all i and j.\n2. The number of packages shipped from each warehouse should not exceed its supply: sum(x[i][j]) <= supply[i] for all i.\n3. The number of packages shipped to each destination should meet its demand: sum(x[i][j]) >= demand[j] for all j.\n\nAssuming that the supply and demand values are given, we can use linear programming solvers like the simplex method or specialized transportation problem algorithms to find the optimal shipping plan and the minimum total cost.\n\nHowever, since the supply and demand values are not provided in the problem, we cannot determine the exact optimal shipping plan and minimum total cost."
