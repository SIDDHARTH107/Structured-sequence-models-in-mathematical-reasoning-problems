The expected annual returns and standard deviation (risk) for each security are:\n\n- Stock A: expected return 11%, standard deviation 20%\n- Stock B: expected return 7%, standard deviation 10%\n- Bond C: expected return 4%, standard deviation 5%\n\nThe correlation between stock A and B is 0.6, between stock A and bond C is -0.2, and between stock B and bond C is 0.4. What is the optimal investment portfolio that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal investment portfolio, we need to calculate the expected return and risk (standard deviation) for different combinations of investments in stock A, stock B, and bond C. We will use the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to find the optimal portfolio.\n\nLet x, y, and z be the proportions of the investment in stock A, stock B, and bond C, respectively. Since the total investment is $100,000, we have:\n\nx + y + z = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\n\nRp = x * 11% + y * 7% + z * 4%\n\nThe risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated as:\n\nσp² = (x * 20%)² + (y * 10%)² + (z * 5%)² + 2 * x * y * 0.6 * 20% * 10% + 2 * x * z * (-0.2) * 20% * 5% + 2 * y * z * 0.4 * 10% * 5%\n\nWe need to find the combination of x, y, and z that maximizes the expected return (Rp) while minimizing the risk (σp). This can be done using optimization techniques, such as the Efficient Frontier.\n\nUsing the Efficient Frontier, we can find the optimal portfolio that lies on the curve where the risk-return trade-off is the best. This point is called the Tangency Portfolio. To find the Tangency Portfolio, we need to calculate the Sharpe Ratio for different combinations of x, y, and z:\n\nSharpe Ratio = (Rp - Rf) / σp\n\nWhere Rf is the risk-free rate. Assuming a risk-free rate of 2%, we can calculate the Sharpe Ratio for different combinations of x, y, and z.\n\nBy calculating the Sharpe Ratio for different combinations of x, y, and z, we can find the optimal portfolio that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk. This can be done using optimization software or tools like Excel Solver.\n\nAfter running the optimization, we can find the optimal investment proportions for stock A, stock B, and bond C that maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk. The optimal portfolio will depend on the investor's risk tolerance and preferences."
