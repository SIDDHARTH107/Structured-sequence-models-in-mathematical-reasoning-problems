    "message_2": "Yes, the function f(x) = 2x + 1 is computable by a Turing machine. \n\nIn computability theory, a function is said to be computable if there exists an algorithm that can calculate the function for any given input. A Turing machine is a theoretical model of computation that can simulate any algorithm, given enough time and resources. If a function can be computed by an algorithm, it can be computed by a Turing machine.\n\nThe function f(x) = 2x + 1 is a simple linear function, and it can be computed using basic arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition). An algorithm to compute this function would be:\n\n1. Take the input value x.\n2. Multiply x by 2.\n3. Add 1 to the result from step 2.\n4. Output the result from step 3.\n\nSince there exists an algorithm to compute the function f(x) = 2x + 1, it is computable by a Turing machine."
