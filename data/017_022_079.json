    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 15 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities for n_3 are 1, 4, or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 12 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1.\n\nNow, we can rule out some cases. If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then there would be a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of the group, and the group would be the direct product of these subgroups, which would be abelian. So, we must have either n_2 > 1 or n_3 > 1.\n\nIf n_2 = 3, then there would be 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 4. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 2-subgroups must be trivial, there would be 3 * (4 - 1) = 9 elements of order 2 in the group. If n_3 = 4, then there would be 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 3. Similarly, there would be 4 * (3 - 1) = 8 elements of order 3 in the group. However, this would account for 9 + 8 + 1 (the identity element) = 18 elements, which is not enough to form a group of order 60. Therefore, we must have n_3 = 10.\n\nSo, we have n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 10. In this case, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup and P_3 be a Sylow 3-subgroup. Then |P_2| = 4 and |P_3| = 3. Since P_3 is a Sylow 3-subgroup, it is isomorphic to either Z_3 or the non-abelian group of order 3, but since there is no non-abelian group of order 3, P_3 must be isomorphic to Z_3. Similarly, P_2 must be isomorphic to either Z_4 or the non-abelian group of order 4, which is the Klein four-group V_4. If P_2 is isomorphic to Z_4, then the group would be the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which would be abelian. Therefore, P_2 must be isomorphic to V_4.\n\nNow, we can form a non-abelian group of order 60 by taking the semidirect product of P_3 and P_2, denoted as P_3 ⋊ P_2. To do this, we need a non-trivial homomorphism φ: P_2 → Aut(P_3). Since P_2 is isomorphic to V_4, it has three elements of order 2. The automorphism group of P_3, Aut(P_3), is isomorphic to Z_2, so there is a non-trivial homomorphism φ that maps each element of order 2 in P_2 to the non-identity automorphism of P_3.\n\nThus, there is a non-abelian group of order 60 given by the semidirect product P_3 ⋊ P_2, where P_3 is isomorphic to Z_3 and P_2 is isomorphic to V_4. This group is also known as the symmetric group S_5, which is the group of all permutations of 5 elements. In conclusion, there is exactly one non-abelian group of order 60, and an example of such a group is the symmetric group S_5."
