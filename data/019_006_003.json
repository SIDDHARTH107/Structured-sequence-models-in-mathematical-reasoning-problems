    "message_1": "Unfortunately, I cannot provide a numerical problem related to Deontic logic as it is a branch of logic that deals with ethical concepts such as duty, obligation, and permission, and does not involve numerical computations. However, here is a sample question related to Deontic logic:\n\nAssume there is a rule that says \"All students must attend at least 80% of their classes to pass the course.\" If a student attended 75% of their classes, what obligations or permissions can be attributed to them according to Deontic logic?",
    "message_2": "According to Deontic logic and the given rule, a student must attend at least 80% of their classes to pass the course. Since the student attended only 75% of their classes, they have not fulfilled the obligation to attend 80% of the classes. Therefore, the student is not permitted to pass the course based on the attendance requirement."
