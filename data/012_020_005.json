    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, and it is a subgroup of the symmetric group on the vertex set.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the automorphisms by considering the possible permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. Let's denote the vertices as V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5, corresponding to the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the graph.\n\n1. The identity automorphism: (V1)(V2)(V3)(V4)(V5)\n2. Swap V2 and V3, and V4 and V5: (V1)(V2 V3)(V4 V5)\n3. Swap V1 and V4, and V2 and V5: (V1 V4)(V2 V5)(V3)\n4. Swap V1 and V4, and V3 and V5: (V1 V4)(V2)(V3 V5)\n5. Swap V1 and V5, and V2 and V4: (V1 V5)(V2 V4)(V3)\n6. Swap V1 and V5, and V3 and V4: (V1 V5)(V2)(V3 V4)\n7. Swap V2 and V3: (V1)(V2 V3)(V4)(V5)\n8. Swap V4 and V5: (V1)(V2)(V3)(V4 V5)\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms that preserve the adjacency relation in the given graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of the graph is:\n\n{ (V1)(V2)(V3)(V4)(V5), (V1)(V2 V3)(V4 V5), (V1 V4)(V2 V5)(V3), (V1 V4)(V2)(V3 V5), (V1 V5)(V2 V4)(V3), (V1 V5)(V2)(V3 V4), (V1)(V2 V3)(V4)(V5), (V1)(V2)(V3)(V4 V5) }"
