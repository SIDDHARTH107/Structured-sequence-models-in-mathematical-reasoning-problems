    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 (cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (Klein-4 group), we can examine the properties of the elements in G.\n\nFirst, let's recall the structures of C4 and V4:\n\nC4 = {1, a, a^2, a^3}, where a is a generator and a^4 = 1.\nV4 = {1, a, b, c}, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1 and ab = c, bc = a, ac = b.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G:\n\nSince G has order 4, there are 4 elements in G. Let's denote them as 1 (identity), x, y, and z.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nIf G has an element of order 4, say x, then G = {1, x, x^2, x^3}, and x^4 = 1. This structure is the same as C4, so in this case, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 4.\nIf G has no element of order 4, then the maximum order of any element in G is 2. This means that x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = 1. Now, we can analyze the product of two distinct elements, say xy. Since x and y are distinct, xy â‰  1. Also, (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = 1, so xy must be an element of order 2. The only remaining element of order 2 is z, so xy = z. Similarly, we can show that xz = y and yz = x. This structure is the same as V4, so in this case, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 depending on whether it has an element of order 4 or not."
