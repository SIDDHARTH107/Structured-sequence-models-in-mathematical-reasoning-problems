    "message_2": "The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_n+1 = 1 - a * x_n^2 + y_n\ny_n+1 = b * x_n\n\nwhere a and b are parameters. In this case, a = 1.4 and b = 0.3.\n\nA fixed point of the Hénon map is a point (x, y) that remains unchanged under the map, i.e., it satisfies:\n\nx = 1 - a * x^2 + y\ny = b * x\n\nTo find the fixed points, we can solve this system of equations. First, we can express y in terms of x from the second equation:\n\ny = b * x = 0.3 * x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\nx = 1 - a * x^2 + 0.3 * x\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation in x:\n\na * x^2 + (0.3 - 1) * x + 1 = 0\n1.4 * x^2 - 0.7 * x + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for x:\n\nx = (-B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4 * A * C)) / (2 * A)\n\nwhere A = 1.4, B = -0.7, and C = 1. Plug in the values:\n\nx = (0.7 ± sqrt((-0.7)^2 - 4 * 1.4 * 1)) / (2 * 1.4)\n\nCalculate the discriminant (B^2 - 4 * A * C):\n\n(-0.7)^2 - 4 * 1.4 * 1 = 0.49 - 5.6 = -5.11\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for x. Therefore, there are no fixed points for the Hénon map with parameter values a = 1.4 and b = 0.3. The maximum number of fixed points is 0."
