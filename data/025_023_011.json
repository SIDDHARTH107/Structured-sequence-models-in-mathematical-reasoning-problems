    "message_1": "Let X be a non-singular cubic surface in projective 3-space P^3 over the field of complex numbers. Let L be the symmetric matrix of intersection numbers among the twelve lines in P^3 that are contained in X. \n\nWhat is the rank of L?",
    "message_2": "The rank of L is 7.\n\nTo see why, consider the Plücker coordinates of the twelve lines contained in X. These twelve lines are in the Grassmannian Gr(1,3), which is a 4-dimensional projective space. The Plücker coordinates of the lines are given by the 4x4 Pfaffians of a 4x6 matrix, which is the matrix of intersection numbers of the twelve lines.\n\nThe rank of this matrix is the dimension of the linear space spanned by the Plücker coordinates, which is at most 4. However, since X is non-singular, the twelve lines are in general position, and the Plücker coordinates span a 4-dimensional linear space. Therefore, the rank of the matrix of intersection numbers is 4.\n\nNow, consider the symmetric matrix L of intersection numbers among the twelve lines. The rank of L is the same as the rank of the matrix of intersection numbers, which is 4. However, since L is symmetric, its rank is even. Therefore, the rank of L must be at least 6.\n\nFinally, note that the twelve lines form a configuration known as the Schläfli double six, which consists of two sets of six lines, each of which intersect in a configuration known as the Schläfli hexad. The intersection numbers between lines in the same hexad are all 1, while the intersection numbers between lines in different hexads are all 0. This configuration implies that the rank of L is at least 7.\n\nPutting all these facts together, we conclude that the rank of L is 7."
