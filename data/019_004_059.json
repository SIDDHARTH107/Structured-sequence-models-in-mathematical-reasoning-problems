    "message_1": "Consider a temporal logic statement \"At every even second in time, the proposition P is true\". If P is true at time 0 (i.e., P(0) is true), is P true at time 6?",
    "message_2": "Yes, P is true at time 6.\n\nSince the given temporal logic statement says that \"At every even second in time, the proposition P is true\", we can deduce that P is true at all even time instances. Time 6 is an even number (as it is divisible by 2), so according to the statement, P is true at time 6."
