    "message_1": "In a block design, there are 15 treatments and every pair of treatments occurs together in exactly 3 blocks. How many blocks are in the design?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of blocks in the design, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of blocks = (Number of pairs * Number of times each pair occurs together) / (Number of treatments - 1)\n\nThere are 15 treatments, so there are C(15, 2) pairs of treatments, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. \n\nC(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * (15 - 2)!) = 105 pairs\n\nEach pair occurs together in exactly 3 blocks. Therefore, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nNumber of blocks = (105 * 3) / (15 - 1) = 315 / 14 = 22.5\n\nSince the number of blocks must be an integer, there is an error in the problem statement or the block design does not exist with the given conditions."
