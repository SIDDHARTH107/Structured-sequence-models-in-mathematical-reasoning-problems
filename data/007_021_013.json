    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding the prime factors of a composite number. Here's how we can apply it to find the prime factorization of 504:\n\n1. Choose a random starting point x_0 and a function f(x). A common choice for f(x) is f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod N), where N is the number we want to factor. Let's choose x_0 = 2.\n\n2. Generate a sequence of numbers using the function f(x) and the previous number in the sequence: x_i = f(x_(i-1)) (mod N).\n\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between two numbers in the sequence and N. If the GCD is not 1 or N, it is a non-trivial factor of N.\n\nLet's start generating the sequence and calculating the GCD:\n\ni | x_i | GCD(x_i - x_(i-1), 504)\n--------------------------------\n1 | 5   | GCD(5 - 2, 504) = 1\n2 | 26  | GCD(26 - 5, 504) = 1\n3 | 677 | GCD(677 - 26, 504) = 3\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, 3. Now we can divide 504 by 3 to get 168. We'll repeat the process for 168:\n\ni | x_i | GCD(x_i - x_(i-1), 168)\n--------------------------------\n1 | 5   | GCD(5 - 2, 168) = 1\n2 | 26  | GCD(26 - 5, 168) = 3\n\nWe found another factor, 3. Divide 168 by 3 to get 56. Repeat the process for 56:\n\ni | x_i | GCD(x_i - x_(i-1), 56)\n-------------------------------\n1 | 5   | GCD(5 - 2, 56) = 1\n2 | 26  | GCD(26 - 5, 56) = 7\n\nWe found a factor, 7. Divide 56 by 7 to get 8. Since 8 is not prime, we'll repeat the process for 8:\n\ni | x_i | GCD(x_i - x_(i-1), 8)\n-------------------------------\n1 | 5   | GCD(5 - 2, 8) = 1\n2 | 26  | GCD(26 - 5, 8) = 2\n\nWe found a factor, 2. Divide 8 by 2 to get 4. Repeat the process for 4:\n\ni | x_i | GCD(x_i - x_(i-1), 4)\n-------------------------------\n1 | 5   | GCD(5 - 2, 4) = 2\n\nWe found another factor, 2. Divide 4 by 2 to get 2, which is prime.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 504 is 2^3 * 3^2 * 7^1, or 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 7."
