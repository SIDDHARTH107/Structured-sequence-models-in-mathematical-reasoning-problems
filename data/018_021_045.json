    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1, 2, 3}\nB - A = {7, 8}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection is the set of elements which are in both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to verify that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B. The distributive property states that:\n\nA ∆ (B ∩ C) = (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ C)\n\nLet's find A ∆ (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 5, 6}\nA - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3}\n(A ∩ B) - A = {}\n\nSo, A ∆ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ (A ∩ B)):\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}\nA ∆ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3}\n\nSo, (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ (A ∩ B)) = {1, 2, 3}\n\nSince A ∆ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3} and (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ (A ∩ B)) = {1, 2, 3}, the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B."
