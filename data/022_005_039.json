Thus, we need to find the second derivative of the function (z-π/3)^3 * f(z) at z = π/3.\n\nFirst, let's find the function (z-π/3)^3 * f(z):\n\ng(z) = (z-π/3)^3 * (cos z)/[(z-π/3)^3] = cos z\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of g(z):\n\ng'(z) = -sin z\ng''(z) = -cos z\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at z = π/3:\n\ng''(π/3) = -cos(π/3) = -cos(π/3) = -1/2\n\nFinally, we apply the formula for the residue:\n\nRes[f(z), z = π/3] = (1/(3-1)!) * g''(π/3) = (1/2!) * (-1/2) = -1/4\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) = (cos z)/[(z-π/3)^3] at z = π/3 is -1/4."
