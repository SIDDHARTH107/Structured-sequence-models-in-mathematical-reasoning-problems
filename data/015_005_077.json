    "message_2": "To compute the largest Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler system, we first need to linearize the system around a trajectory. Let's denote the Jacobian matrix of the system as J:\n\n$J = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial z'}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial z'}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial z'}{\\partial z} \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$J = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0.1 & 0 \\\\ z & 0 & x-5.7 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we need to compute the Lyapunov exponents by analyzing the behavior of the system near its attractor. This typically involves numerically integrating the system and computing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at each point along the trajectory. The largest Lyapunov exponent is then given by the average growth rate of the largest eigenvalue.\n\nHowever, calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent for a specific system like the Rössler system requires numerical simulations and cannot be done analytically. There are several numerical methods available to compute the Lyapunov exponents, such as the Wolf algorithm or the Rosenstein algorithm.\n\nIn summary, the largest Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler system cannot be determined analytically, and numerical simulations must be used to compute it."
