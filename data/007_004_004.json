    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 120, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (120) by the smaller number (72) and find the remainder:\n   120 รท 72 = 1, remainder 48\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (72) and the smaller number with the remainder (48) from the previous step:\n   72 รท 48 = 1, remainder 24\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0:\n   48 รท 24 = 2, remainder 0\n\nThe last non-zero remainder (24) is the greatest common divisor of 72 and 120. So, the GCD(72, 120) = 24."
