    "message_1": "Sure, here is an example question for a math student to solve related to Beauty Contest Game:\n\nIn a Beauty Contest Game, there are 100 participants who must choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game is the person whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the chosen numbers. Assuming that all participants are rational and strategic, what number should you choose to maximize your chances of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. If all participants choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average would be 50. In this case, 2/3 of the average would be 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\n2. However, all participants are rational and strategic, so they will also think about choosing 33.33. If everyone chooses 33.33, the new average would be 33.33, and 2/3 of this new average would be 2/3 * 33.33 ≈ 22.22.\n\n3. Participants will take this into account and adjust their choices accordingly. If everyone chooses 22.22, the new average would be 22.22, and 2/3 of this new average would be 2/3 * 22.22 ≈ 14.81.\n\n4. This process of iteratively adjusting the chosen number will continue until the chosen number converges to a stable value. In this case, the stable value is 0.\n\nSo, as a rational and strategic participant, you should choose 0 to maximize your chances of winning the Beauty Contest Game."
