    "message_2": "A Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that can be constructed by iteratively replacing each line segment with a pattern of smaller line segments. The total perimeter of a Vicsek fractal after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = P * (5/3)^n\n\nwhere P is the initial perimeter (in this case, 4, since there are 4 unit line segments in the initial square) and n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor a Vicsek fractal with four iterations and unit line segments of length 1, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (5/3)^4\n\nPerimeter ≈ 4 * 625/81\n\nPerimeter ≈ 30.8642\n\nSo, the total perimeter of a Vicsek fractal with four iterations and unit line segments of length 1 is approximately 30.8642."
