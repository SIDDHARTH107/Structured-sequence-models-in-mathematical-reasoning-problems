    "message_2": "To determine the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we first need to understand the definitions of these terms.\n\nA cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge (also known as a cut edge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nSince we are given a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the following properties to help us determine the number of cut vertices and bridges:\n\n1. A connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges is a tree, and it has no cycles.\n2. A connected graph with n vertices and more than n-1 edges must have at least one cycle.\n\nIn our case, the graph has 7 vertices and 10 edges, which means it has more than 6 edges (7-1), so it must have at least one cycle.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible cases:\n\n1. If the graph is connected, we can use the following facts:\n   a. A vertex with a degree of 1 cannot be a cut vertex.\n   b. A vertex with a degree of 2 can be a cut vertex if and only if it is part of a bridge.\n   c. A vertex with a degree of 3 or more can be a cut vertex.\n\n2. If the graph is not connected, we can't determine the number of cut vertices and bridges without more information about the structure of the graph.\n\nSince we don't have enough information about the connectivity of the graph, we cannot determine the exact number of cut vertices and bridges. However, we can say that the graph has at least one cycle and that the number of cut vertices and bridges depends on the specific structure of the graph."
