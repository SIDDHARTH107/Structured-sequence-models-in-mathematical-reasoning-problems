The growth rate is estimated to be 3% per year. Write a differential equation that models the growth of the population and use it to predict the population after 5 years.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first write the differential equation that models the growth of the population, and then we'll use it to predict the population after 5 years.\n\nStep 1: Write the differential equation\nThe population growth is proportional to its size, so we can write the differential equation as follows:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time in years, and k is the growth rate constant.\n\nWe are given that the growth rate is 3% per year, so k = 0.03.\n\nNow, our differential equation becomes:\n\ndP/dt = 0.03P\n\nStep 2: Solve the differential equation\nTo solve this differential equation, we'll first separate the variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.03 dt\n\nNow, we'll integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.03 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we'll use the initial condition that the population is 15,000 when t = 0:\n\nln(15000) = 0.03(0) + C\nC = ln(15000)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution to the differential equation:\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + ln(15000)\n\nTo solve for P, we'll take the exponential of both sides:\n\nP(t) = e^(0.03t + ln(15000))\nP(t) = e^(0.03t) * e^(ln(15000))\nP(t) = 15000 * e^(0.03t)\n\nStep 3: Predict the population after 5 years\nNow, we'll use the equation we found to predict the population after 5 years (t = 5):\n\nP(5) = 15000 * e^(0.03 * 5)\nP(5) ≈ 15000 * e^(0.15)\nP(5) ≈ 15000 * 1.1618\nP(5) ≈ 17427\n\nSo, the predicted population of the small city after 5 years is approximately 17,427."
