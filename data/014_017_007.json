    "message_1": "A person intercepted an encrypted message that was encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. After performing a frequency analysis on the message, the person identified that the most frequent letter is 'E'. If the message is in English language, what is the probability that a randomly selected letter from the message is 'E'?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that a randomly selected letter from the message is 'E', we need to know the frequency of the letter 'E' in the English language. According to the letter frequency analysis, the letter 'E' is the most common letter in the English language, appearing approximately 12.7% of the time.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected letter from the message is 'E' is approximately 0.127 or 12.7%."
