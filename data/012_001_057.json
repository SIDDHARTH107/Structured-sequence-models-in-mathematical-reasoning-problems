Create a set of unvisited vertices and initialize the distance to the starting vertex (vertex 1) to 0 and the distances to all other vertices to infinity.\n\n```\nUnvisited: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nDistances: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞}\n```\n\n2. Select the vertex with the smallest distance (vertex 1) and mark it as visited.

Select the vertex with the smallest distance among the unvisited vertices (vertex 5) and mark it as visited. Since this is the destination vertex, we can stop the algorithm.\n\n```\nVisited: {1, 3, 2, 5}\nUnvisited: {4}\nDistances: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 5, 5: 4}\n```\n\nThe shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 5 has a distance of 4. To find the path itself, we can backtrack from vertex 5:\n\n- Vertex 5 has a distance of 4 and is connected to vertex 3 (distance 2) with an edge weight of 2. So, the previous vertex in the path is vertex 3.\n- Vertex 3 has a distance of 2 and is connected to vertex 1 (distance 0) with an edge weight of 2. So, the previous vertex in the path is vertex 1.\n\nThus, the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 5 is 1 → 3 → 5."
