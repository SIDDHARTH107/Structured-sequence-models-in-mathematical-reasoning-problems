Let $\\mathcal{M}(D)$ denote the space of maps $u: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ which are asymptotic at infinity to $D$. Define the Floer homology group $HF^*(D)$ of $D$ as the homology of a complex which is generated by the critical points of an appropriate functional on $\\mathcal{M}(D)$. Compute the Floer homology group $HF^*(D)$ for $D$ being the core curve of a genus-$2$ handlebody.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology group $HF^*(D)$ for $D$ being the core curve of a genus-2 handlebody, we first need to understand the structure of the handlebody and the curve $D$. A genus-2 handlebody can be thought of as a 3-dimensional solid with two \"holes\" or handles, and its boundary is a closed oriented surface $\\Sigma$ of genus 2. The core curve $D$ is a simple closed curve that runs through one of the handles.\n\nNow, let's consider the space of maps $\\mathcal{M}(D)$ and the functional on this space. The functional should be chosen such that its critical points correspond to the intersection points of $D$ with a representative of a homology class in $H_1(\\Sigma)$. In this case, we can choose the functional to be the symplectic action functional, which measures the symplectic area enclosed by a curve in the space of maps.\n\nThe Floer homology group $HF^*(D)$ is then the homology of a chain complex generated by the critical points of this functional. To compute this homology group, we need to understand the differential on the chain complex, which counts the number of gradient flow lines between critical points. In this case, the gradient flow lines correspond to holomorphic curves in the space of maps with boundary on $D$.\n\nFor a genus-2 handlebody, the core curve $D$ is homologically non-trivial, and it intersects a representative of a non-trivial homology class in $H_1(\\Sigma)$ exactly once. Therefore, the chain complex has only one generator, corresponding to the intersection point of $D$ with this homology class.\n\nSince there is only one generator, the differential on the chain complex must be trivial, i.e., the boundary of the generator is zero. Therefore, the Floer homology group $HF^*(D)$ is isomorphic to the homology of the chain complex, which is a one-dimensional vector space generated by the intersection point of $D$ with the non-trivial homology class.\n\nIn conclusion, the Floer homology group $HF^*(D)$ for $D$ being the core curve of a genus-2 handlebody is a one-dimensional vector space."
