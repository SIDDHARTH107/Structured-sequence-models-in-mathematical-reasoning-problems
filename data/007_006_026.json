    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 84 and 132 using the Euclidean algorithm, we will perform a series of divisions with remainder until we reach a remainder of 0. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (132) by the smaller number (84) and find the remainder:\n   132 รท 84 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 48.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (132) with the smaller number (84) and the smaller number with the remainder (48) from the previous step, and then divide again:\n   84 รท 48 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 36.\n\n3. Repeat the process:\n   48 รท 36 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 12.\n\n4. Continue the process:\n   36 รท 12 = 3 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\nNow that we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 12. So, the GCD of 84 and 132 is 12."
