    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA ∆ B = {2, 3, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) and B, denoted as (A ∆ B) ∩ B. The intersection is the set of elements that are in both sets.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {3}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B. \n\nA ∩ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∩ B) and B, denoted as (A ∩ B) ∆ B.\n\n(A ∩ B) ∆ B = {1, 3, 4}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) ∩ B and (A ∩ B) ∆ B.\n\n((A ∆ B) ∩ B) ∆ ((A ∩ B) ∆ B) = {3} ∆ {1, 3, 4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection. We want to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C)\n\nLet's consider an element x that belongs to (A ∆ B) ∩ C. This means that x belongs to A ∆ B and x belongs to C. There are two cases:\n\n1. x belongs to A and not B: In this case, x belongs to A ∩ C and not B ∩ C, so x belongs to (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C).\n2. x belongs to B and not A: In this case, x belongs to B ∩ C and not A ∩ C, so x belongs to (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C).\n\nNow, let's consider an element x that belongs to (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C). There are two cases:\n\n1. x belongs to A ∩ C and not B ∩ C: In this case, x belongs to A and C, and not B, so x belongs to (A ∆ B) ∩ C.\n2. x belongs to B ∩ C and not A ∩ C: In this case, x belongs to B and C, and not A, so x belongs to (A ∆ B) ∩ C.\n\nSince we have shown that the elements of (A ∆ B) ∩ C and (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) are the same, we can conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C)"
