    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 5^3 = 125. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 mod 5 and divides 125. The only possibilities are 1 and 25. \n\nCase 1: There is only one Sylow 5-subgroup of G.\nIn this case, the unique Sylow 5-subgroup is normal in G. Let P be this Sylow 5-subgroup. Since |P| = 5^3, P is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P is either a cyclic group of order 125 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 5^2. Since P is normal in G and G has no other proper nontrivial subgroups, G must be isomorphic to P. Thus, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 5^2.\n\nCase 2: There are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\nLet P be one of these Sylow 5-subgroups. Since |P| = 5^3, P is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P is either a cyclic group of order 125 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 5^2. \n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of its Sylow 5-subgroups by conjugation. This action is transitive, and the stabilizer of P is the normalizer of P in G, denoted N_G(P). By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, |G:N_G(P)| = 25. Since |G| = 125, we have |N_G(P)| = 5. \n\nLet H be a subgroup of G such that P ⊆ H ⊆ N_G(P). Then, |H| = 5 or |H| = 25. If |H| = 25, then H is a normal subgroup of G, as it has index 5 in G. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 5^2, as desired.\n\nIf |H| = 5, then H = P, and P is a normal subgroup of G. In this case, G is isomorphic to P, which is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 5^2, as desired.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 5^3 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 5^2."
