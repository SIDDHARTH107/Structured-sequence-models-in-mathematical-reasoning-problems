    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the matrix of variables, and B is the matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |       X = | x |       B = |  6  |\n    | 2 -3  2 |           | y |           | -1  |\n    | 3  1 -1 |           | z |           |  7  |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 1(-3*-1 - 2*2) - 1(2*-1 - 3*2) + 1(2*1 - 3*-3)\n       = 1(3 - 4) - 1(-2 - 6) + 1(2 + 9)\n       = 1(-1) + 1(4) + 1(11)\n       = -1 + 4 + 11\n       = 14\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the adjugate of A and then divide each element by the determinant to get A^(-1).\n\nadj(A) = | (-3*-1 - 2*2)  (2*-1 - 3*2)  (2*1 - 3*-3) |\n         | (1*-1 - 1*2)   (1*1 - 1*3)   (1*1 - 1*-1) |\n         | (1*2 - 1*2)    (1*1 - 1*1)   (1*1 - 1*3)  |\n\nadj(A) = | -1  -8  11 |\n         | -3   2   2 |\n         |  0   0  -2 |\n\nNow, we find A^(-1) by dividing each element of adj(A) by the determinant (14).\n\nA^(-1) = 1/14 * | -1  -8  11 |\n                | -3   2   2 |\n                |  0   0  -2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -1/14  -4/7  11/14 |\n         | -3/14   1/7   1/7  |\n         |   0     0   -1/7  |\n\nNow, we can find the solution matrix X by multiplying A^(-1) with B.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -1/14  -4/7  11/14 |  |  6  |\n    | -3/14   1/7   1/7  |  | -1  |\n    |   0     0   -1/7  |  |  7  |\n\nX = | (-1/14)*6 + (-4/7)*(-1) + (11/14)*7 |\n    | (-3/14)*6 + (1/7)*(-1)  + (1/7)*7   |\n    |  0         +  0          + (-1/7)*7 |\n\nX = | -6/14 + 4/7 + 77/14 |\n    | -18/14 - 1/7 + 7/7   |\n    | -1                  |\n\nX = | 75/14 |\n    |  1/14  |\n    | -1     |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 75/14, y = 1/14, and z = -1."
