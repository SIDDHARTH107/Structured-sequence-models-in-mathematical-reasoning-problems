    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at point A(1,1,2), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4. Then,\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we evaluate the partial derivatives at point A(1,1,2):\n\n∂F/∂x|_(1,1,2) = 2(1) = 2\n∂F/∂y|_(1,1,2) = 2(1) = 2\n∂F/∂z|_(1,1,2) = 2(2) = 4\n\nThe gradient vector at point A is (2, 2, 4). This vector is normal to the tangent plane, so we can use it to find the equation of the tangent plane.\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n\n2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) + 4(z - 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2x + 2y + 4z - 14 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane at point A(1,1,2) is:\n\n2x + 2y + 4z = 14"
