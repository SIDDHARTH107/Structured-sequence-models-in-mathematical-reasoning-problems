    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle |z|=1 under the mapping f(z)=z/(z-1), we can substitute z = e^(iθ) into the function, where θ is the angle in polar coordinates and |z|=1.\n\nf(z) = f(e^(iθ)) = e^(iθ) / (e^(iθ) - 1)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of f(e^(iθ)):\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |e^(iθ) / (e^(iθ) - 1)|\n\nUsing the property |a/b| = |a|/|b|:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |e^(iθ)| / |e^(iθ) - 1|\n\nSince |e^(iθ)| = 1 (as it lies on the unit circle):\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = 1 / |e^(iθ) - 1|\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of the denominator:\n\n|e^(iθ) - 1| = |cos(θ) + i*sin(θ) - 1|\n\nUsing the distance formula in the complex plane:\n\n|e^(iθ) - 1| = sqrt((cos(θ) - 1)^2 + (sin(θ))^2)\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expression for |f(e^(iθ))|:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = 1 / sqrt((cos(θ) - 1)^2 + (sin(θ))^2)\n\nThis expression represents the magnitude of the image of the circle |z|=1 under the mapping f(z)=z/(z-1). To find the image of the circle, we need to find the curve in the complex plane that has this magnitude.\n\nLet w = f(e^(iθ)), then w = u + iv, where u and v are the real and imaginary parts of w, respectively. We can write:\n\nu + iv = (cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)) / (cos(θ) - 1 + i*sin(θ))\n\nNow, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nu = (cos(θ)(cos(θ) - 1) + sin(θ)sin(θ)) / ((cos(θ) - 1)^2 + (sin(θ))^2)\nv = (sin(θ)(cos(θ) - 1) - cos(θ)sin(θ)) / ((cos(θ) - 1)^2 + (sin(θ))^2)\n\nThese parametric equations describe the image of the circle |z|=1 under the mapping f(z)=z/(z-1). The image is a circle with radius 1/2 centered at 1/2 in the complex plane."
