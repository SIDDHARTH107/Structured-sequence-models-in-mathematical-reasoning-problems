    "message_1": "A factory produces laptops, and the probability that a produced laptop is defective is 0.05. If 500 laptops are produced in a given week, what is the probability that at least 25 of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective laptops\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of laptops produced (500 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective laptops (we want at least 25)\n- p is the probability of a laptop being defective (0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a laptop not being defective (0.95)\n\nSince we want the probability of having at least 25 defective laptops, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 25 to k = 500.\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] for k = 0 to 24\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the sum:\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - Σ[C(500, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 24\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so we can use a statistical software or calculator to find the result. Using a binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF) calculator, we find:\n\nP(X >= 25) ≈ 1 - P(X < 25) ≈ 1 - 0.0114 ≈ 0.9886\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 of the 500 laptops produced in a given week will be defective is approximately 0.9886 or 98.86%."
