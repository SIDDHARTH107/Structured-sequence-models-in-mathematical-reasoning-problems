    "message_2": "To find the optimal price that maximizes the company's total revenue, we first need to find the revenue function. The revenue function is given by R(P) = P * Q(P), where R is the total revenue and Q(P) is the demand function.\n\nWe are given the demand function Q(P) = 400 - 2P. Now, we can find the revenue function:\n\nR(P) = P * (400 - 2P)\n\nR(P) = 400P - 2P^2\n\nTo find the optimal price that maximizes the revenue, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function. We do this by taking the first derivative of R(P) with respect to P and setting it equal to zero:\n\nR'(P) = dR(P)/dP = 400 - 4P\n\nNow, set R'(P) = 0:\n\n400 - 4P = 0\n\n4P = 400\n\nP = 100\n\nSo, the optimal price that maximizes the company's total revenue is $100 per unit."
