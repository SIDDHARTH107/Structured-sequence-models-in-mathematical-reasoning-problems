    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum sample size required for estimating the population mean with a given confidence level and margin of error, we can use the formula:\n\nn = (Z * σ / E)^2\n\nwhere n is the sample size, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, σ is the population standard deviation, and E is the margin of error.\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table). The population standard deviation (σ) is given as 2.5, and the margin of error (E) is given as 0.5.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nn = (1.96 * 2.5 / 0.5)^2\nn = (4.9)^2\nn ≈ 24.01\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a sample, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum sample size required is 25."
