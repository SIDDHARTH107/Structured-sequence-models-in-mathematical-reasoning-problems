We can find a bijective function between them as follows:\n\nf(1) = a\nf(2) = b\nf(3) = e\nf(4) = c\nf(5) = d\n\nThis function is a bijection, as it maps each vertex in G to a unique vertex in H, and vice versa. The edges in G and H are also preserved under this mapping, which confirms that the graphs are isomorphic."
