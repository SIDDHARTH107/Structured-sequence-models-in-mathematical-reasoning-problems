    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation $2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 2 = 0$, we can try to find its roots using various methods such as factoring, synthetic division, or the rational root theorem. In this case, we will use the rational root theorem to find possible rational roots.\n\nThe rational root theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root, it must be of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nFor the given polynomial, the constant term is 2 and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of 2 are 1 and 2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are:\n\n$\\frac{\\pm1}{\\pm1}$ and $\\frac{\\pm2}{\\pm1}$, which simplifies to:\n\n$\\pm1$ and $\\pm2$\n\nNow, we will test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial equation:\n\n1. For $x = 1$:\n$2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 1 + 2 = 2 - 3 + 1 + 2 = 2$\n\n2. For $x = -1$:\n$2(-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 + (-1) + 2 = -2 - 3 - 1 + 2 = -4$\n\n3. For $x = 2$:\n$2(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 2 + 2 = 16 - 12 + 2 + 2 = 8$\n\n4. For $x = -2$:\n$2(-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 + (-2) + 2 = -16 - 12 - 2 + 2 = -28$\n\nNone of these possible rational roots are actual roots of the polynomial. This means that the polynomial has no rational roots. To find the roots, we would need to use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator to approximate the real roots."
