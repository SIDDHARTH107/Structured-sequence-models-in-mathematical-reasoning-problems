    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. Then, we'll use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations is:\n\n```\n| 2  3  4 | 12 |\n| 1  4  2 | 13 |\n| 5 -2  1 |  5 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nDivide the first row by 2:\n\n```\n| 1  1.5  2 |  6 |\n| 1  4    2 | 13 |\n| 5 -2    1 |  5 |\n```\n\nSubtract the first row from the second row and the first row multiplied by 5 from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  1.5  2 |  6 |\n| 0  2.5  0 |  7 |\n| 0 -9.5 -9 | -25|\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nDivide the second row by 2.5:\n\n```\n| 1  1.5    2 |  6  |\n| 0  1   0    |  2.8|\n| 0 -9.5 -9   | -25 |\n```\n\nAdd the second row multiplied by 9.5 to the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  1.5    2 |  6  |\n| 0  1   0    |  2.8|\n| 0  0  -9   | -11.6|\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nDivide the third row by -9:\n\n```\n| 1  1.5    2 |  6  |\n| 0  1   0    |  2.8|\n| 0  0   1    |  1.29|\n```\n\nz ≈ 1.29\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find y and x.\n\nSubstitute z into the second row to find y:\n\ny ≈ 2.8 - 1.29 = 1.51\n\nSubstitute y and z into the first row to find x:\n\nx ≈ 6 - 1.5(1.51) - 2(1.29) ≈ 0.995\n\nSo, the approximate solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx ≈ 0.995\ny ≈ 1.51\nz ≈ 1.29"
