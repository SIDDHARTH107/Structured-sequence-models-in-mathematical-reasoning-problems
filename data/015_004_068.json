    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a complex fractal, and calculating its exact area is a challenging task. However, it is known that the Mandelbrot set is contained within the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. This circle has an area of π(2^2) = 4π.\n\nThe exact area of the Mandelbrot set is not known, but it has been estimated to be approximately 1.50659177 square units. This value is obtained through numerical approximations and computer simulations. It is important to note that this is an approximation, and the true area of the Mandelbrot set may be slightly different."
