    "message_1": "Suppose the heights of male students in a college are normally distributed with mean 175 cm and standard deviation 7 cm. If a random sample of 40 male students is selected, what is the probability that their average height is greater than 178 cm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we are given the following information:\n- The population mean (μ) is 175 cm.\n- The population standard deviation (σ) is 7 cm.\n- The sample size (n) is 40.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The mean of the sampling distribution (μx̄) is equal to the population mean (μ), which is 175 cm.\n\nμx̄ = μ = 175 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx̄). This is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation (σ) by the square root of the sample size (n):\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n = 7 / √40 ≈ 1.107\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is greater than 178 cm. To do this, we will use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μx̄) / σx̄\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (178 - 175) / 1.107 ≈ 2.71\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that corresponds to this z-score. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area to the right of the z-score (since we want the probability that the sample mean is greater than 178 cm). \n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the area to the right of z = 2.71 is approximately 0.0033. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the average height of the 40 male students is greater than 178 cm is approximately 0.0033 or 0.33%."
