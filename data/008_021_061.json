    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method on the augmented matrix. We will perform a series of row operations to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 5 & 2 & 12 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 & 6 \\\\ 4 & 7 & 3 & 15 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-2/3)Row 1 + Row 2 and Row 3 with (-4/3)Row 1 + Row 3:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 5 & 2 & 12 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1/3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1/3 & -5 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n3. Multiply Row 2 by -1:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 5 & 2 & 12 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1/3 & 6 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1/3 & -5 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with Row 2 + Row 3:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 5 & 2 & 12 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1/3 & 6 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nNow we have reached the row-echelon form. Since the last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 1, which is a contradiction, we can conclude that the system of linear equations has no solution."
