    "message_1": "A furniture company wants to determine the maximum profit it can earn by producing two types of chairs: a standard chair and a deluxe chair. The standard chair requires 4 units of wood, 2 units of labor, and can be sold for $100. The deluxe chair requires 6 units of wood, 3 units of labor, and can be sold for $150. The company has 32 units of wood and 16 units of labor available for production. How many standard chairs and deluxe chairs should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of standard chairs and y be the number of deluxe chairs. The constraints for wood and labor can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 32 (wood constraint)\n2x + 3y ≤ 16 (labor constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 100x + 150y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 32\n2x + 3y ≤ 16\n\nDivide the first inequality by 2:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 16\n\nNow we have the same inequality twice, so we only need to consider one of them:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 16\n\nTo find the feasible region, we'll find the intercepts and graph the inequality:\n\nx-intercept: set y = 0, then 2x ≤ 16, so x ≤ 8\ny-intercept: set x = 0, then 3y ≤ 16, so y ≤ 16/3 ≈ 5.33\n\nNow we need to test the corner points of the feasible region to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. (0, 0): P(0, 0) = 100(0) + 150(0) = $0\n2. (8, 0): P(8, 0) = 100(8) + 150(0) = $800\n3. (0, 5): P(0, 5) = 100(0) + 150(5) = $750\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 8 standard chairs and no deluxe chairs, with a profit of $800."
