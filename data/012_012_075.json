    "message_2": "To find the girth of the graph, we need to identify the shortest cycle in the graph. A cycle is a closed path in which the first and last vertices are the same, and no vertex is visited more than once (except for the first and last vertex).\n\nIn this graph, we can see several cycles:\n\n1. A-B-C-A (length 3)\n2. B-D-E-B (length 3)\n3. C-E-F-C (length 3)\n4. D-E-G-D (length 3)\n5. E-F-G-E (length 3)\n\nAll these cycles have a length of 3, which is the shortest possible cycle in the graph. Therefore, the girth of the graph is 3."
