    "message_1": "Two drivers are driving on a road towards each other. The first driver decides to swerve at the last second to avoid a collision, while the second driver decides not to swerve. If both drivers swerve, they both get a payoff of 0. If neither driver swerves, they both get a payoff of -10. If one driver swerves and the other does not, the driver who does not swerve gets a payoff of 10, while the other driver gets a payoff of -5. \n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for each driver and what will be their payoffs?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for each driver, we can create a payoff matrix:\n\n```\n                  Driver 2\n                  Swerve    No Swerve\nDriver 1\nSwerve           (0, 0)     (-5, 10)\nNo Swerve         (10, -5)   (-10, -10)\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze the matrix:\n\n1. If Driver 1 swerves and Driver 2 swerves, both get a payoff of 0.\n2. If Driver 1 swerves and Driver 2 does not swerve, Driver 1 gets a payoff of -5 and Driver 2 gets a payoff of 10.\n3. If Driver 1 does not swerve and Driver 2 swerves, Driver 1 gets a payoff of 10 and Driver 2 gets a payoff of -5.\n4. If neither driver swerves, both get a payoff of -10.\n\nThe optimal strategy for each driver is to choose the action that maximizes their minimum possible payoff (minimax strategy). \n\nFor Driver 1:\n- If they swerve, their minimum payoff is -5 (if Driver 2 does not swerve).\n- If they do not swerve, their minimum payoff is -10 (if Driver 2 does not swerve).\n\nFor Driver 2:\n- If they swerve, their minimum payoff is -5 (if Driver 1 does not swerve).\n- If they do not swerve, their minimum payoff is -10 (if Driver 1 does not swerve).\n\nBoth drivers should choose to swerve, as it maximizes their minimum possible payoff. In this case, their payoffs will be (0, 0)."
