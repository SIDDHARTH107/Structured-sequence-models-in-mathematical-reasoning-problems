    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of X, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, we will divide the square into two open sets U and V such that U covers the top and bottom sides of the square and V covers the left and right sides of the square. The intersection of U and V will be a cross shape in the middle of the square.\n\nNow, let's consider the identifications. The top and bottom sides of the square are identified, so U is homeomorphic to a cylinder. Similarly, the left and right sides of the square are identified, so V is also homeomorphic to a cylinder. The intersection of U and V is homeomorphic to a cross shape, which deformation retracts onto a wedge of two circles.\n\nUsing the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we have:\n\nπ1(X) = (π1(U) * π1(V)) / π1(U ∩ V)\n\nSince U and V are both homeomorphic to cylinders, their fundamental groups are isomorphic to the integers Z:\n\nπ1(U) = π1(V) = Z\n\nThe intersection U ∩ V is homeomorphic to a wedge of two circles, so its fundamental group is the free product of two copies of Z:\n\nπ1(U ∩ V) = Z * Z\n\nNow, we can compute the fundamental group of X:\n\nπ1(X) = (Z * Z) / Z\n\nThe fundamental group of X is the free product of two copies of Z, which is isomorphic to the free group on two generators:\n\nπ1(X) = F_2\n\nSo, the fundamental group of X at any point is the free group on two generators."
