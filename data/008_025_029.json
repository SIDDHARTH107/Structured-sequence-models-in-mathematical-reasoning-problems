    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 10\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 10\n2x + 3y = 10\n\nSince the equations are the same, they represent the same line in the coordinate plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, as every point on the line is a solution. We can express the general solution in terms of one variable, for example, y:\n\nFrom the equation 2x + 3y = 10, we can solve for x:\n\n2x = 10 - 3y\nx = (10 - 3y) / 2\n\nSo the general solution is x = (10 - 3y) / 2, where y can be any real number."
