    "message_1": "A traveling salesman wants to visit 5 different cities in a certain order, minimizing the total distance he travels. The distances between each city are given below:\n\nCity 1 to City 2: 10 km\nCity 1 to City 3: 5 km\nCity 1 to City 4: 8 km\nCity 1 to City 5: 12 km\nCity 2 to City 3: 7 km\nCity 2 to City 4: 9 km\nCity 2 to City 5: 6 km\nCity 3 to City 4: 3 km\nCity 3 to City 5: 4 km\nCity 4 to City 5: 8 km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance that the salesman can travel to visit all 5 cities in the given order?",
    "message_2": "Since the salesman needs to visit the cities in a certain order, we can simply add up the distances between each consecutive city in the given order.\n\nThe shortest possible distance is:\n\nCity 1 to City 2: 10 km\nCity 2 to City 3: 7 km\nCity 3 to City 4: 3 km\nCity 4 to City 5: 8 km\n\nTotal distance: 10 + 7 + 3 + 8 = 28 km\n\nThe shortest possible distance the salesman can travel to visit all 5 cities in the given order is 28 km."
