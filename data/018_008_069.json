    "message_2": "To calculate A x B and B x A, we need to find the Cartesian product of the sets. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\n\nNow, let's find A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, A x B and B x A are not equal, since the ordered pairs in each set are different. The elements in A x B have the first element from set A and the second element from set B, while the elements in B x A have the first element from set B and the second element from set A."
