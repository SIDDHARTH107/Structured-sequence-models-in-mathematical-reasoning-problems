    "message_2": "To find the Ricci curvature tensor of the Riemannian manifold M, we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols, then the Riemann curvature tensor, and finally contract the indices to obtain the Ricci tensor.\n\nThe metric tensor g is given by:\n\ng = dy^2 + dx^2\n\nIn matrix form, the metric tensor g_ij is:\n\ng_ij = | 1  0 |\n       | 0  1 |\n\nThe inverse metric tensor g^ij is the same as g_ij since it's a diagonal matrix with ones on the diagonal:\n\ng^ij = | 1  0 |\n       | 0  1 |\n\nNow, we compute the Christoffel symbols Γ^k_ij using the formula:\n\nΓ^k_ij = (1/2) * g^(kl) * (∂g_il/∂x^j + ∂g_jl/∂x^i - ∂g_ij/∂x^l)\n\nSince the metric tensor g_ij is constant, all its derivatives with respect to x^i and x^j are zero. Therefore, all the Christoffel symbols Γ^k_ij are zero.\n\nNext, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor R^l_ijk using the formula:\n\nR^l_ijk = ∂Γ^l_ij/∂x^k - ∂Γ^l_ik/∂x^j + Γ^l_mk * Γ^m_ij - Γ^l_mj * Γ^m_ik\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols are zero, the Riemann curvature tensor R^l_ijk is also zero.\n\nFinally, we compute the Ricci curvature tensor R_ij by contracting the indices of the Riemann curvature tensor:\n\nR_ij = R^k_ikj\n\nSince the Riemann curvature tensor is zero, the Ricci curvature tensor R_ij is also zero.\n\nThus, the Ricci curvature tensor of the flat torus M with the given metric tensor is:\n\nR_ij = | 0  0 |\n       | 0  0 |"
