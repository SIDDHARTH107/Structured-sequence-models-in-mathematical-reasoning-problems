    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To find the minimum number of vertices needed to form a vertex cover, we can use the concept of maximum matching.\n\nA matching in a graph is a set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex. A maximum matching is a matching with the maximum possible number of edges. According to König's theorem, in a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine if the given graph G is bipartite or not. Therefore, we cannot directly apply König's theorem. Instead, we can use an upper bound for the size of the maximum matching to estimate the minimum vertex cover.\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a matching is half the number of vertices (rounded down) since each vertex can be part of at most one edge in the matching. In this case, with 7 vertices, the maximum number of edges in a matching is floor(7/2) = 3.\n\nNow, since each edge in the maximum matching can cover at most 2 edges in the graph, the minimum vertex cover size is at least half the number of edges, rounded up. So, the minimum vertex cover size is ceil(10/2) = 5.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices needed to form a vertex cover for G is 5."
