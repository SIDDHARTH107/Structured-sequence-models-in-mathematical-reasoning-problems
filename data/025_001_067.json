    "message_2": "To apply Bezout's theorem, we first need to determine the degrees of the two curves C1 and C2. The degree of a curve is the highest total degree of any term in its defining equation.\n\nFor C1, the highest total degree is 3 (from the term x^3). So, the degree of C1 is 3.\n\nFor C2, the highest total degree is 2 (from the terms 2x^2 and -y^2). So, the degree of C2 is 2.\n\nNow we can apply Bezout's theorem, which states that the number of intersection points between two algebraic curves in the complex projective plane is equal to the product of their degrees, counting multiplicities and including points at infinity.\n\nIn this case, the number of intersection points is:\n\n3 (degree of C1) * 2 (degree of C2) = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 intersection points between C1 and C2 in the complex projective plane, counting multiplicities and including points at infinity."
