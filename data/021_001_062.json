    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n   [ 2  3 -1 |  1 ]\n   [ 4 -2  3 |  7 ]\n   [-3  4  1 | -5 ]\n\n2. Perform row operations to get an upper triangular matrix:\n\n   - Multiply the first row by 2 and subtract it from the second row:\n     R2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n\n   [ 2  3 -1 |  1 ]\n   [ 0 -8  5 |  5 ]\n   [-3  4  1 | -5 ]\n\n   - Multiply the first row by -3/2 and add it to the third row:\n     R3 = R3 + (-3/2) * R1\n\n   [  2   3  -1 |  1 ]\n   [  0  -8   5 |  5 ]\n   [  0   0 1/2 | -3 ]\n\n3. Now, perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n   - From the third row, we have:\n     (1/2)z = -3\n     z = -6\n\n   - Substitute z into the second row and solve for y:\n     -8y + 5(-6) = 5\n     -8y - 30 = 5\n     -8y = 35\n     y = -35/8\n\n   - Substitute y and z into the first row and solve for x:\n     2x + 3(-35/8) - (-6) = 1\n     2x - 105/8 + 6 = 1\n     2x = 1 + 105/8 - 48/8\n     2x = 57/8\n     x = 57/16\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 57/16, y = -35/8, and z = -6."
