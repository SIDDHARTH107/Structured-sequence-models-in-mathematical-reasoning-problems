    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 54 and 24 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (54) by the smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n   54 รท 24 = 2 with a remainder of 6.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (54) with the smaller number (24) and the smaller number with the remainder (6).\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n\n   24 รท 6 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6. Therefore, the GCD of 54 and 24 is 6."
