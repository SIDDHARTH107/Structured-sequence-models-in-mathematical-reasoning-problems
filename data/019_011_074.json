    "message_2": "To determine whether the statement \"If the temperature is greater than or equal to 25 degrees Celsius, then the humidity level is greater than or equal to 50%\" is true or false, we can use the rules of relevance logic.\n\nLet's denote the temperature as T and the humidity level as H. We are given the following conditions:\n\n1. 20 ≤ T ≤ 30\n2. 40% ≤ H ≤ 60%\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statement:\n\n\"If the temperature is greater than or equal to 25 degrees Celsius, then the humidity level is greater than or equal to 50%.\"\n\nThis statement can be written as:\n\nIf T ≥ 25, then H ≥ 50%.\n\nWe need to check if this statement is true or false within the given conditions.\n\nLet's consider the case when T = 25 (the lowest value for which the statement's condition is met). According to the given conditions, H can be anywhere between 40% and 60%. So, it is possible that H is less than 50% (e.g., H = 45%).\n\nIn this case, the statement \"If T ≥ 25, then H ≥ 50%\" is false, as the temperature is greater than or equal to 25 degrees Celsius, but the humidity level is not greater than or equal to 50%.\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of relevance logic and the given conditions, the statement is false."
