    "message_1": "In a factory, it is estimated that 1 in 20 employees will experience a workplace accident this year. If there are 500 workers in the factory, what is the probability that at least 25 of them will experience an accident this year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (accidents) in n trials (workers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (accident) for each trial (worker), which is 1/20\n- n is the total number of trials (workers), which is 500\n- k is the number of successes (accidents) we want to find the probability for\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 25 accidents, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 25 to k = 500.\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 24\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - Σ [C(500, k) * (1/20)^k * (19/20)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 24\n\nCalculating this sum can be done using a calculator or software that can handle large numbers and probabilities. The result is:\n\nP(X >= 25) ≈ 0.982\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 workers will experience an accident this year is approximately 98.2%."
