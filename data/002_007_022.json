    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm, a base of 5 cm, and a top side of 7 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 10 cm, the top side (or shorter base) is 7 cm, and the bottom side (or longer base) is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (7 + 5) * 10\nArea = (1/2) * (12) * 10\nArea = 6 * 10\nArea = 60 square centimeters\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 60 square centimeters."
