    "message_2": "Since f(z) is analytic on the open set {z: |z|<1}, we can represent f(z) as a power series converging to f(z) in this region. We are given that f(z) = 1/(1-z) for all z such that |z|<1. We can expand this function as a geometric series:\n\nf(z) = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + ...\n\nNow, we want to find the value of f(2). However, 2 is not in the region of convergence (|z|<1), so we cannot directly substitute 2 into the power series. Since f(z) is only defined and analytic for |z|<1, we cannot determine the value of f(2) based on the given information."
