    "message_1": "A certain airline has a record of 85% on-time flights departing from New York to San Francisco. If a group of 5 people are taking this flight, what is the probability that all 5 of them will experience an on-time departure?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that all 5 people will experience an on-time departure, we need to multiply the probability of each person's flight being on-time. Since the probability of an on-time flight is 85% (or 0.85 as a decimal), the calculation is as follows:\n\n0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.85^5 â‰ˆ 0.4437\n\nSo, the probability that all 5 people will experience an on-time departure is approximately 44.37%."
