    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a possible question for a math student to solve related to Population growth models using differential equations:\n\nSuppose a population of rabbits increases at a rate proportional to its size, with a doubling time of 4 years. If the population starts with 100 rabbits, find the population after 8 years.\n\nHint: Let P(t) be the population at time t, and use the differential equation dP/dt = kP, where k is the proportionality constant. Then solve for P(t) using the initial condition P(0) = 100 and the fact that P doubles every 4 years.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll follow the hint and use the differential equation dP/dt = kP. First, we need to find the proportionality constant k. We know that the population doubles every 4 years, so when t = 4, P(4) = 2 * P(0) = 200.\n\n1. Solve the differential equation dP/dt = kP:\n\nSeparate variables and integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫k dt\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nP(t) = e^(kt + C) = e^C * e^(kt)\n\n2. Apply the initial condition P(0) = 100:\n\n100 = e^C * e^(k * 0)\n\n100 = e^C\n\nC = ln(100)\n\n3. Plug C back into the equation for P(t):\n\nP(t) = e^(kt + ln(100))\n\nP(t) = 100 * e^(kt)\n\n4. Use the fact that P(4) = 200 to find k:\n\n200 = 100 * e^(4k)\n\n2 = e^(4k)\n\nln(2) = 4k\n\nk = ln(2) / 4\n\n5. Plug k back into the equation for P(t):\n\nP(t) = 100 * e^((ln(2) / 4) * t)\n\n6. Finally, find the population after 8 years, P(8):\n\nP(8) = 100 * e^((ln(2) / 4) * 8)\n\nP(8) = 100 * e^(ln(2) * 2)\n\nP(8) = 100 * (e^(ln(2)))^2\n\nP(8) = 100 * 2^2\n\nP(8) = 100 * 4\n\nP(8) = 400\n\nSo, the population of rabbits after 8 years will be 400."
