A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nFor A:\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor B:\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of A and B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B."
