    "message_2": "First, let's check if the origin $(0,0)$ is included in the set. Plug in $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the equation:\n\n$(0)^2(0)+(0)(0)^2-2(0)^2-2(0)^2+4(0)+4(0)-4=0$\n\n$-4=0$\n\nSince this is not true, the origin $(0,0)$ is not included in the set.\n\nNow let's find the set of all points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$xy(x+y)-2x^2-2y^2+4x+4y-4=0$\n\nFactor out $x+y$ from the first two terms:\n\n$(x+y)(xy-2x-2y)+4x+4y-4=0$\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: $u=x+y$ and $v=xy$. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$u(v-2u)+4u-4=0$\n\nNow, solve for $v$:\n\n$v-2u+4=0$\n\n$v=2u-4$\n\nNow, substitute back $x+y$ for $u$ and $xy$ for $v$:\n\n$xy=2(x+y)-4$\n\nNow, we need to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:\n\n$y=\\frac{2(x+y)-4}{x}$\n\n$y=\\frac{2x+2y-4}{x}$\n\n$x*y=2x+2y-4$\n\n$x*y-2y=2x-4$\n\n$y(x-2)=2x-4$\n\n$y=\\frac{2x-4}{x-2}$\n\nSo, the set of all points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation is given by:\n\n$y=\\frac{2x-4}{x-2}$ for $x\\neq2$\n\nNote that we exclude $x=2$ because it would make the denominator zero, which is not allowed."
