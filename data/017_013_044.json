Cyclic group C18:\nThe Cayley table for the cyclic group C18 is a 18x18 table where each element is generated by the powers of a single generator g, with g^18 = e (the identity element). The table is filled by taking the product of the elements in each row and column, modulo 18.\n\n2. Non-abelian group of order 18 (semidirect product of C3 and C6):\nThis group can be represented as a semidirect product of C3 and C6, with elements {(a, b) | a in C3, b in C6}, and the group operation defined as (a1, b1) * (a2, b2) = (a1 * a2, b1 * a1^(b2) * b2). The Cayley table for this group is a 18x18 table, where the elements are ordered as pairs (a, b), and the table is filled by taking the product of the elements in each row and column using the group operation defined above.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 (C3 x C6):\nThis group can be represented as a direct product of C3 and C6, with elements {(a, b) | a in C3, b in C6}, and the group operation defined as (a1, b1) * (a2, b2) = (a1 * a2, b1 * b2). The Cayley table for this group is a 18x18 table, where the elements are ordered as pairs (a, b), and the table is filled by taking the product of the elements in each row and column using the group operation defined above.\n\nTo classify each group, we can look at the properties of their Cayley tables:\n\n- If the table is commutative (i.e., symmetric about the main diagonal), then the group is abelian. If the group is abelian and has a single generator, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18.\n- If the table is not commutative and the group has a non-trivial center (i.e., elements that commute with all other elements), then the group is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 (C3 x C6).\n- If the table is not commutative and the group has a trivial center (i.e., only the identity element commutes with all other elements), then the group is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18 (semidirect product of C3 and C6)."
