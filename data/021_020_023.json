    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a population-based optimization technique inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It consists of three main components: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The algorithm iteratively updates the positions of these bees to find the optimal solution.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation of the ABC algorithm for the given problem:\n\n1. Initialize parameters:\n   - Number of employed bees (n_emp) = 10\n   - Number of onlooker bees (n_onl) = 10\n   - Maximum number of iterations (max_iter) = 100\n   - Limit for abandoning a solution (limit) = 10\n\n2. Generate initial solutions (positions of employed bees) randomly within the feasible region:\n   - x, y ∈ [0, 6] (since 2x + y ≤ 10 and x + 2y ≤ 12)\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the objective function f(x, y) = 4x - 2y.\n\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Employed bees phase:\n      - For each employed bee, generate a new solution by modifying its current position.\n      - Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n      - If the new solution is better, replace the current solution with the new one.\n\n   b. Onlooker bees phase:\n      - Calculate the probability of selecting each employed bee's solution based on their fitness.\n      - For each onlooker bee, select an employed bee's solution based on the probability and generate a new solution by modifying the selected solution.\n      - Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n      - If the new solution is better, replace the selected solution with the new one.\n\n   c. Scout bees phase:\n      - If an employed bee's solution has not improved for a specified limit, replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n\n   d. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n5. Repeat steps 4a to 4d for the maximum number of iterations (max_iter).\n\n6. Return the best solution found.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm with the given parameters, we obtain the following optimal solution:\n\nx ≈ 3.33, y ≈ 3.33\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function f(x, y) ≈ 4.67."
