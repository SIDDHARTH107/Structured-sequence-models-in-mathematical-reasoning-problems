    "message_2": "Yes, this is a valid degree sequence for a simple graph. To justify this, we can use the Havel-Hakimi theorem, which states that a non-increasing sequence of non-negative integers is graphical (i.e., can be the degree sequence of a simple graph) if and only if the sequence obtained by deleting the first number and subtracting 1 from the next k numbers is graphical, where k is the first number in the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given degree sequence in non-increasing order: {4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2}. Now, let's apply the Havel-Hakimi theorem:\n\n1. Remove the first number (4) and subtract 1 from the next 4 numbers: {3, 2, 1, 1, 2}.\n2. Rearrange the sequence in non-increasing order: {3, 2, 2, 1, 1}.\n3. Remove the first number (3) and subtract 1 from the next 3 numbers: {1, 1, 0, 1}.\n4. Rearrange the sequence in non-increasing order: {1, 1, 1, 0}.\n5. Remove the first number (1) and subtract 1 from the next 1 number: {0, 0, 0}.\n\nWe have reached the sequence of all zeros, which means that the original degree sequence is graphical and can represent a simple graph."
