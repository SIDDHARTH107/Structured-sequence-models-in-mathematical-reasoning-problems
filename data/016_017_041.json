    "message_2": "The length of the Heighway Dragon Curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial segment length) * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 7th iteration. So, n = 7.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^7) = 1 * 128 = 128 units\n\nThe length of the Heighway Dragon Curve after the 7th iteration is 128 units."
