    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x. \n\nGiven equation: x^2 + y^2 = 25\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (y^2) = d/dx (25)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n2x + 2y * (dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y * (dy/dx) = -2x\n\n(dy/dx) = -2x / 2y\n\n(dy/dx) = -x / y\n\nNow, we can find the derivative at the point (3,4):\n\n(dy/dx) = -3 / 4\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at the point (3,4) is -3/4."
