The wave equation describing the sound wave is given by:\n\nu(x, t) = A * sin(kx - wt)\n\nwhere u is the displacement of the wave at position x and time t, A is the amplitude, k = 2π/λ is the wave number (λ is the wavelength), and w = 2πf is the angular frequency (f is the frequency).\n\nIf the sound wave has a frequency of 200 Hz and a wavelength of 1.65 meters, what is the maximum displacement of the wave at a position x = 0.5 meters and time t = 0.01 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum displacement of the wave at position x = 0.5 meters and time t = 0.01 seconds, we need to first find the amplitude A, wave number k, and angular frequency w.\n\nGiven:\nFrequency, f = 200 Hz\nWavelength, λ = 1.65 meters\n\nWe can find k and w using the given formulas:\nk = 2π/λ\nw = 2πf\n\nk = 2π/1.65 ≈ 3.80 m^(-1)\nw = 2π(200) ≈ 1256.64 s^(-1)\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude A. Since the wave speed is given as 330 m/s, we can use the formula:\n\nWave speed = frequency × wavelength\n\n330 = 200 × λ\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 330/200 = 1.65 meters (which is given)\n\nNow, we can use the wave equation to find the displacement u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = A * sin(kx - wt)\n\nWe are given x = 0.5 meters and t = 0.01 seconds. Plugging these values into the equation:\n\nu(0.5, 0.01) = A * sin(3.80 * 0.5 - 1256.64 * 0.01)\n\nTo find the maximum displacement, we need to find the maximum value of the sine function, which is 1. Therefore, the maximum displacement occurs when:\n\nsin(3.80 * 0.5 - 1256.64 * 0.01) = 1\n\nA * 1 = A\n\nThus, the maximum displacement of the wave at position x = 0.5 meters and time t = 0.01 seconds is equal to the amplitude A. However, we do not have enough information to determine the value of A. If you provide the amplitude, we can find the maximum displacement."
