    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the differential evolution algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 50 random solutions (x-values) within the interval [-10, 10].\n2. For each iteration, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each solution in the population, create a trial vector by selecting three other random solutions, and applying the mutation and crossover operations.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the trial vector using the function f(x).\n   c. If the trial vector has a better fitness (lower value of f(x)) than the original solution, replace the original solution with the trial vector.\n3. Repeat steps 2a-2c for 1000 iterations.\n4. Find the solution with the best fitness in the final population.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the differential evolution algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return np.sin(x) * (1 + np.sin(3 * x / 2))\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, mutation_factor, crossover_prob, iterations):\n    population = np.random.uniform(-10, 10, size=pop_size)\n    fitness = f(population)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            a, b, c = population[np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)]\n            trial_vector = a + mutation_factor * (b - c)\n            if np.random.rand() < crossover_prob:\n                trial_vector = population[i]\n\n            trial_fitness = f(trial_vector)\n            if trial_fitness < fitness[i]:\n                population[i] = trial_vector\n                fitness[i] = trial_fitness\n\n    best_solution = population[np.argmin(fitness)]\n    best_fitness = np.min(fitness)\n\n    return best_solution, best_fitness\n\npop_size = 50\nmutation_factor = 0.7\ncrossover_prob = 0.9\niterations = 1000\n\nbest_solution, best_fitness = differential_evolution(pop_size, mutation_factor, crossover_prob, iterations)\nprint(f\"Minimum value of f(x) = {best_fitness} at x = {best_solution}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the minimum value of the function f(x) and the corresponding x-value after 1000 iterations using the specified parameters. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm."
