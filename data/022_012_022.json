    "message_1": "Suppose that $f(z) = \\frac{(z^2 - 4)(z^2 - 9)}{(z-1)^3}$ is a meromorphic function on the complex plane. Find the poles and their orders of $f(z)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the poles of the meromorphic function $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator of the function is equal to zero. In this case, the denominator is $(z-1)^3$. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$(z-1)^3 = 0$\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we find that the only pole of $f(z)$ is at $z = 1$. Now, we need to find the order of this pole. The order of a pole is the number of times it appears as a root of the denominator. Since the denominator is $(z-1)^3$, the order of the pole at $z = 1$ is 3.\n\nNow let's analyze the zeros of the numerator to see if there are any other poles. The numerator is given by $(z^2 - 4)(z^2 - 9)$. Factoring this expression, we get:\n\n$(z+2)(z-2)(z+3)(z-3)$\n\nThis expression has zeros at $z = \\pm 2$ and $z = \\pm 3$. However, these zeros do not correspond to poles of the function $f(z)$, as they do not cause the denominator to be zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the meromorphic function $f(z) = \\frac{(z^2 - 4)(z^2 - 9)}{(z-1)^3}$ has one pole at $z = 1$ with order 3."
