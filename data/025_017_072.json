Let Y be the blow-up of X at p, and let E denote the exceptional divisor. Show that there exists a unique line bundle M on Y of degree 2g-2 which restricts to L on X \\ {p} and has no global sections vanishing on E. Determine the degree deg(M) of the line bundle M on Y.",
    "message_2": "To show the existence of the line bundle M on Y, we first note that the blow-up Y is also a smooth projective curve. Let π: Y → X be the blow-up morphism. We have an exact sequence of sheaves on Y:\n\n0 → O_Y(-E) → O_Y → π^*O_X → 0\n\nTensoring this sequence with π^*L, we get:\n\n0 → π^*L(-E) → π^*L → π^*(L ⊗ O_X) → 0\n\nSince L has a non-zero global section that vanishes at p, we have a non-zero global section of π^*L that vanishes along E. Thus, we can define M = π^*L(-E). This line bundle M restricts to L on X \\ {p} because π^*L(-E)|_(X\\{p}) = π^*L|_(X\\{p}) = L|_(X\\{p}).\n\nNow, we show that M has no global sections vanishing on E. Suppose there exists a global section s of M that vanishes on E. Then s is also a global section of π^*L, and since s vanishes on E, it must vanish at p. But this contradicts the definition of M, which is supposed to have no global sections vanishing on E. Therefore, there are no global sections of M vanishing on E.\n\nTo show the uniqueness of M, suppose there exists another line bundle M' on Y with the same properties. Then M' = π^*L'(-E) for some line bundle L' on X. Since M and M' both restrict to L on X \\ {p}, we have π^*L(-E)|_(X\\{p}) = π^*L'(-E)|_(X\\{p}). This implies that L = L', and hence M = M'.\n\nFinally, we determine the degree of M. We have:\n\ndeg(M) = deg(π^*L(-E)) = deg(π^*L) - deg(E)\n\nSince π^*L has degree 2g-2 and E has degree 1 (as the exceptional divisor of a blow-up at a single point), we get:\n\ndeg(M) = (2g-2) - 1 = 2g-3\n\nThus, the degree of the line bundle M on Y is 2g-3."
