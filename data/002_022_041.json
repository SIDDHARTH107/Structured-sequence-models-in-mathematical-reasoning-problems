    "message_1": "A torus has an outer radius of 10 cm and an inner radius of 6 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (the major radius), and r is the radius of the tube (the minor radius).\n\nIn this case, the outer radius is 10 cm and the inner radius is 6 cm. To find the major radius R, we can take the average of the outer and inner radii:\n\nR = (10 + 6) / 2 = 8 cm\n\nThe minor radius r is the difference between the outer and inner radii divided by 2:\n\nr = (10 - 6) / 2 = 2 cm\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 8 * 2^2\nVolume = 2 * (3.14159)^2 * 8 * 4\nVolume ≈ 2 * 9.8696 * 8 * 4\nVolume ≈ 628.3184 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 628.32 cm^3."
