    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve construction is a fractal pattern that starts with an equilateral triangle and iteratively removes smaller equilateral triangles at each stage. The number of triangles removed at each stage follows a geometric progression.\n\nIn the first stage, there is 1 triangle removed (the original triangle).\nIn the second stage, there are 3 triangles removed (1 original + 2 new ones).\nIn the third stage, there are 9 triangles removed (3 original + 6 new ones).\nIn the fourth stage, there are 27 triangles removed (9 original + 18 new ones).\n\nIn general, the number of triangles removed at the nth stage is given by the formula:\n\nT(n) = 3^(n-1)\n\nSo, for the 5th stage:\n\nT(5) = 3^(5-1) = 3^4 = 81\n\nThere are 81 triangles in the 5th stage of the Sierpinski sieve construction."
