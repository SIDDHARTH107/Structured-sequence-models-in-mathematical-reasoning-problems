    "message_1": "Suppose you want to find the approximate value of the constant π. Use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π by simulating the random throwing of darts at a unit square of side 1. Assume that the darts always hit the square and that the probability of hitting any point within the square is the same. Conduct 10,000 trials and calculate the value of π based on the number of darts that land within the quarter circle inscribed in the unit square (i.e., the upper right quadrant of a unit circle centered at the origin).",
    "message_2": "To estimate the value of π using Monte Carlo simulation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate random points (x, y) within the unit square (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1).\n2. Determine if the point lies within the quarter circle with radius 1 (upper right quadrant of a unit circle centered at the origin). This can be done by checking if x^2 + y^2 ≤ 1.\n3. Count the number of points that lie within the quarter circle.\n4. Calculate the ratio of points within the quarter circle to the total number of points (10,000 trials).\n5. Multiply this ratio by 4 to estimate the value of π.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef monte_carlo_simulation(num_trials):\n    points_inside_circle = 0\n\n    for _ in range(num_trials):\n        x = random.random()\n        y = random.random()\n\n        if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:\n            points_inside_circle += 1\n\n    pi_estimate = 4 * (points_inside_circle / num_trials)\n    return pi_estimate\n\nnum_trials = 10000\npi_estimate = monte_carlo_simulation(num_trials)\nprint(\"Estimated value of π after\", num_trials, \"trials:\", pi_estimate)\n```\n\nThe output will be an approximation of π, which should be close to the actual value of π (3.14159...). Note that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the number of trials, and the result may vary slightly each time the simulation is run due to the random nature of the process."
