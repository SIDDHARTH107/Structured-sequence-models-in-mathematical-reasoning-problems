    "message_2": "The probability that a randomly selected person from the community has attended the music festival is the number of people who attended the festival divided by the total number of people in the community. \n\nIn this case, 300 people attended the festival and there are 1000 people in the community. So, the probability is:\n\n300/1000 = 3/10 = 0.3\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected person from the community has attended the festival is 0.3 or 30%."
