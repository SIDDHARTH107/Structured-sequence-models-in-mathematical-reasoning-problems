    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. The universal set U consists of all single-digit positive integers, which are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. \n\nNow, we can find the complement of A, denoted as A', by removing the elements of A from U:\n\nA' = {1, 8, 9}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of A and A', which means we need to find the elements that are common to both A and A'. However, by definition, the complement of A contains elements that are not in A. Therefore, there are no common elements between A and A', and their intersection is an empty set:\n\nA ∩ A' = {}"
