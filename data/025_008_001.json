Compute the dimension of the complex vector space $H^1(X,\\mathbb{C})$, where $H^1(X,\\mathbb{C})$ denotes the first cohomology group of $X$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{C}$ using the Hodge decomposition theorem.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the complex vector space $H^1(X, \\mathbb{C})$, we will use the Hodge decomposition theorem. The Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a compact KÃ¤hler manifold $X$, the cohomology group $H^k(X, \\mathbb{C})$ can be decomposed as a direct sum of the Hodge groups $H^{p, q}(X)$, where $p + q = k$. In our case, we are interested in $H^1(X, \\mathbb{C})$, so we have:\n\n$H^1(X, \\mathbb{C}) = H^{1, 0}(X) \\oplus H^{0, 1}(X)$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the dimensions of the Hodge groups $H^{1, 0}(X)$ and $H^{0, 1}(X)$. For a non-singular projective algebraic curve $X$, the dimension of $H^{1, 0}(X)$ is equal to the genus $g$ of the curve. To compute the genus of the curve given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2$, we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d - 1)(d - 2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, the degree of the curve is $3$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3 - 1)(3 - 2)}{2} = 1$.\n\nThus, the dimension of $H^{1, 0}(X)$ is $1$. Since $X$ is a non-singular projective algebraic curve, it is also a compact Riemann surface. For compact Riemann surfaces, the dimensions of the Hodge groups $H^{1, 0}(X)$ and $H^{0, 1}(X)$ are equal, so the dimension of $H^{0, 1}(X)$ is also $1$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the dimension of the complex vector space $H^1(X, \\mathbb{C})$ as the sum of the dimensions of the Hodge groups:\n\n$\\dim H^1(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\dim H^{1, 0}(X) + \\dim H^{0, 1}(X) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the complex vector space $H^1(X, \\mathbb{C})$ is $2$."
