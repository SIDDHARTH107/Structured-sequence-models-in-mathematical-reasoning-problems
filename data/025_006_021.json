    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ for a projective plane curve $X$ of degree 4 with no singularities, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that if $X$ is a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ and $H$ is a hyperplane section of $X$, then the restriction map $H^k(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^k(H, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism for $k < n$ and injective for $k = n$.\n\nIn our case, $X$ is a smooth projective plane curve of degree 4, which means it has dimension 1. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that the restriction map $H^k(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^k(H, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism for $k < 1$ and injective for $k = 1$. Since we are interested in the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we have $k = 2 > 1$, so the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem does not directly apply.\n\nHowever, we can use the fact that $X$ is a curve in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$. The cohomology groups of $\\mathbb{P}^2$ are given by $H^k(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ for $k = 0, 2, 4$ and $H^k(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k$ odd. Since $X$ is a curve of degree 4, we can use the adjunction formula to compute the canonical divisor $K_X$ of $X$:\n\n$K_X = (K_{\\mathbb{P}^2} + [X])|_X = (-3[\\mathbb{P}^1] + 4[\\mathbb{P}^1])|_X = [\\mathbb{P}^1]|_X$.\n\nThis implies that the canonical bundle $\\omega_X$ of $X$ is isomorphic to the restriction of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^2}(1)$ to $X$. In particular, we have $H^2(X, \\omega_X) = H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nNow, we can use the Gysin sequence associated to the inclusion $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{P}^2$:\n\n$0 \\to H^0(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^2(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^2(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^4(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\n\nSince $H^0(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = H^4(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H^2(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, we have:\n\n$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$.\n\nFrom this exact sequence, we can deduce that $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the second cohomology group of a projective plane curve of degree 4 with no singularities is $\\mathbb{Z}$."
