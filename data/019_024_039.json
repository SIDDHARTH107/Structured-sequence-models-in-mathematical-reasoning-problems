    "message_1": "Assume that there are three possible answers A, B, and C to a multiple-choice math question. The Abductive logic suggests that a student has a 1/3 chance of guessing the correct answer. If a student guesses on three questions, what is the probability that they will get all three questions wrong?",
    "message_2": "If a student has a 1/3 chance of guessing the correct answer, then they have a 2/3 chance of guessing the wrong answer for each question. To find the probability of getting all three questions wrong, we multiply the probabilities of getting each question wrong:\n\n(2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 8/27\n\nSo, the probability of the student getting all three questions wrong is 8/27."
