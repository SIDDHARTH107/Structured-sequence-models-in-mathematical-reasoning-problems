Otherwise, if G contains an element of order 10 but not of order 20, prove that G is isomorphic to D10. Finally, if G contains no element of order 10 or 20, prove that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20.",
    "message_2": "Case 1: G contains an element of order 20.\nLet a be an element of order 20 in G. Then, by definition, a^20 = e (identity element) and a^n ≠ e for any n < 20. Consider the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>. Since a has order 20, the order of <a> is also 20. Since the order of <a> is equal to the order of G, we have G = <a>. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 20, and it is isomorphic to C20.\n\nCase 2: G contains an element of order 10 but not of order 20.\nLet b be an element of order 10 in G. Then, by definition, b^10 = e and b^n ≠ e for any n < 10. Consider the cyclic subgroup generated by b, denoted by <b>. Since b has order 10, the order of <b> is also 10. Now, since the order of G is 20, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 20. The only possibilities are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. We know that G does not have an element of order 20, and it has an element of order 10 (b). Let c be an element in G that is not in <b>. The order of c must be either 2, 4, or 5. If the order of c is 5, then G would have an element of order 20, which is a contradiction. If the order of c is 4, then the order of bc would be 20, which is also a contradiction. Therefore, the order of c must be 2.\n\nNow, we have an element b of order 10 and an element c of order 2. We can show that G is isomorphic to D10, the dihedral group of order 20. D10 has a presentation D10 = <x, y | x^10 = e, y^2 = e, yxy = x^(-1)>.\n\nDefine a map φ: G → D10 by φ(b^i * c^j) = x^i * y^j for 0 ≤ i < 10 and 0 ≤ j < 2. We can show that φ is an isomorphism:\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since b has order 10 and c has order 2, b^10 = e and c^2 = e. Also, since c is not in <b>, bc ≠ cb. Thus, G has 20 distinct elements of the form b^i * c^j, and φ maps them to distinct elements in D10.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let g1 = b^i * c^j and g2 = b^k * c^l in G. Then, φ(g1 * g2) = φ(b^(i+k) * c^(j+l)) = x^(i+k) * y^(j+l) = (x^i * y^j)(x^k * y^l) = φ(g1)φ(g2).\n\n3. φ is bijective: Since φ maps 20 distinct elements of G to 20 distinct elements of D10, it is both injective and surjective.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to D10.\n\nCase 3: G contains no element of order 10 or 20.\nIn this case, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20. This group has a presentation G = <a, b | a^4 = e, b^5 = e, bab^(-1) = a^(-1)>. Since G does not have elements of order 10 or 20, it must have elements of orders 2, 4, and 5. This group satisfies these conditions and is non-abelian, so G is isomorphic to this non-abelian group of order 20."
