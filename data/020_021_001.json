What is the minimum number of employees required to complete the workload every day, assuming that each employee works continuously and takes no breaks?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out the total processing time required for 120 packages.\n\nProcessing time per package = 5 minutes\nTotal packages = 120\n\nTotal processing time = 5 minutes/package × 120 packages = 600 minutes\n\nNow, let's convert the 8 hours of work per employee into minutes.\n\n8 hours/employee × 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/employee\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of employees required to complete the workload.\n\nMinimum number of employees = Total processing time / Time available per employee\nMinimum number of employees = 600 minutes / 480 minutes/employee\n\nMinimum number of employees = 1.25\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an employee, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of employees required to complete the workload every day is 2."
