    "message_1": "A certain region experiences flooding once every 5 years on average. If the probability of flooding in the next 2 years is 0.3, what is the probability that flooding will occur in the next 3 years?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of flooding in the next 3 years as P(3). Since the region experiences flooding once every 5 years on average, the probability of not flooding in any given year is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of not flooding in the next 2 years, which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. This means that if there is no flooding in the next 2 years, there must be flooding in the 3rd year for the probability of flooding in the next 3 years to be true.\n\nSo, the probability of flooding in the next 3 years can be calculated as the probability of flooding in the next 2 years (0.3) plus the probability of not flooding in the next 2 years (0.7) multiplied by the probability of flooding in the 3rd year (1/5):\n\nP(3) = 0.3 + 0.7 * (1/5)\nP(3) = 0.3 + 0.14\nP(3) = 0.44\n\nTherefore, the probability of flooding in the next 3 years is 0.44 or 44%."
