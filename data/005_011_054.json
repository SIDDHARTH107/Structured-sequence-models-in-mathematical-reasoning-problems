    "message_1": "A soft drink company is conducting an experiment to see if their new drink will increase sales. They randomly select 100 stores and provide them with the new drink to sell for one month. They also choose another 100 stores as a control group that will continue selling the old drink. At the end of the month, they compare the average sales of the new and old drinks in each group. The data shows that the new drink had an average sale of $1,200 with a standard deviation of $100, while the old drink had an average sale of $1,000 with a standard deviation of $80.\n\nCalculate the t-statistic and p-value for this experiment, assuming a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the t-statistic, we will use the formula:\n\nt = (M1 - M2) / sqrt((SD1^2 / N1) + (SD2^2 / N2))\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the means of the two groups, SD1 and SD2 are the standard deviations of the two groups, and N1 and N2 are the sample sizes of the two groups.\n\nIn this case, M1 = $1,200, M2 = $1,000, SD1 = $100, SD2 = $80, N1 = N2 = 100.\n\nt = (1200 - 1000) / sqrt((100^2 / 100) + (80^2 / 100))\nt = 200 / sqrt(10000 / 100 + 6400 / 100)\nt = 200 / sqrt(100 + 64)\nt = 200 / sqrt(164)\nt = 200 / 12.806\nt â‰ˆ 15.61\n\nNow, we need to find the p-value. Since we have a large sample size (N1 = N2 = 100), we can use the normal distribution to approximate the p-value. We will use a two-tailed test because we want to see if there is a significant difference in sales between the two drinks, regardless of the direction.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the p-value for a z-score of 15.61. This value is extremely small and virtually zero, which means it is much less than our significance level of 0.05.\n\nSince the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in sales between the new and old drinks. The new drink appears to have increased sales compared to the old drink."
