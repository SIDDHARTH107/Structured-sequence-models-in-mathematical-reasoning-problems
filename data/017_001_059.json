    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on its order and the properties of groups.\n\nSince the order of G is 4, there are 4 elements in G. Let's denote these elements as {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element. We know that the order of the identity element is 1, and the order of any other element in G must divide the order of G (by Lagrange's theorem). Thus, the possible orders of elements a, b, and c are 1, 2, or 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume that the order of element a is 4. Then, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, and the group operation is defined by the powers of a. This structure is precisely the cyclic group of order 4, C4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C4 in this case.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements of G have order 2.\nIn this case, we have the following properties for elements a, b, and c:\n1. a^2 = e\n2. b^2 = e\n3. c^2 = e\n\nNow, let's consider the product of two distinct non-identity elements, say ab. Since G is a group, the product ab must also be in G. We have three possibilities for the product ab: e, a, or b.\n\n1. If ab = e, then b = a^(-1), which contradicts our assumption that a and b are distinct non-identity elements.\n2. If ab = a, then b = e, which contradicts our assumption that b is a non-identity element.\n3. If ab = b, then a = e, which contradicts our assumption that a is a non-identity element.\n\nThus, the only remaining possibility is that ab = c. Similarly, we can deduce that ac = b and bc = a. This structure is precisely the Klein four-group V4, which has the following group operation table:\n\n```\n  e  a  b  c\ne e  a  b  c\na a  e  c  b\nb b  c  e  a\nc c  b  a  e\n```\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to V4 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, since we have exhausted all possible cases for the structure of G, we can say that the group G of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
