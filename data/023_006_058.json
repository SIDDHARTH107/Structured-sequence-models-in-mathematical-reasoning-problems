What is the frequency associated with the highest magnitude peak in the spectrum, and what is the corresponding coefficient value?",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of f(t), we can use the following formula:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nHowever, since f(t) is a sum of sinusoidal functions, we can directly find the Fourier coefficients using Euler's formula and the properties of sine and cosine functions.\n\nf(t) = 4*sin(2*pi*t) + 5*cos(4*pi*t)\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite the sine and cosine functions as complex exponentials:\n\nsin(x) = (e^(jx) - e^(-jx)) / (2j)\ncos(x) = (e^(jx) + e^(-jx)) / 2\n\nSo, f(t) can be rewritten as:\n\nf(t) = 4 * (e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)) / (2j) + 5 * (e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) / 2\n\nf(t) = 2 * (e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)) / j + 5/2 * (e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt))\n\nNow, we can see that the Fourier transform of f(t) has two non-zero coefficients:\n\nF(2π) = 2 / j\nF(4π) = 5/2\n\nThe magnitude spectrum can be plotted with two peaks at frequencies 2π and 4π, with corresponding magnitudes |2/j| and |5/2|.\n\nThe highest magnitude peak in the spectrum is at frequency 4π, with a corresponding coefficient value of 5/2."
