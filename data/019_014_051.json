    "message_2": "Proof by induction:\n\nBase case (n = 1): \nf^1(x) = f(x) = x^2 = x^(2^1), which is true.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume that the statement is true for some positive integer k, i.e., f^k(x) = x^(2^k).\nNow, we need to show that the statement is true for k+1, i.e., f^(k+1)(x) = x^(2^(k+1)).\n\nConsider the composition of f with itself k+1 times:\nf^(k+1)(x) = f(f^k(x))\n\nBy the inductive hypothesis, we know that f^k(x) = x^(2^k). So, we can substitute this into the equation:\nf^(k+1)(x) = f(x^(2^k))\n\nNow, apply the function f(x) = x^2:\nf^(k+1)(x) = (x^(2^k))^2\n\nUsing the exponentiation rule (a^b)^c = a^(b*c), we get:\nf^(k+1)(x) = x^(2^k * 2)\n\nSince 2^(k+1) = 2^k * 2, we have:\nf^(k+1)(x) = x^(2^(k+1))\n\nThus, by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of f^3(2) and f^4(3):\n\nf^3(2) = 2^(2^3) = 2^8 = 256\n\nf^4(3) = 3^(2^4) = 3^16 = 43,046,721\n\nSo, f^3(2) = 256 and f^4(3) = 43,046,721."
