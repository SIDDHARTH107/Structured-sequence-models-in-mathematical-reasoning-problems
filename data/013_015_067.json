    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to perform a task. The agent's effort determines the outcome of the task, which is either success or failure. The principal values success at $100$ and failure at $0$, while the agent values success at $80$ and failure at $20$. However, the agent's effort affects the probability of success, with effort costing $10$ units of effort that results in a $80\\%$ chance of success and $20$ units of effort that increases the chance of success to $90\\%$. Assume that effort is a continuous variable.\n\nWhat is the agent's optimal effort level in terms of maximizing their own payoff?\n\nWhat is the principal-agent welfare under that effort level?",
    "message_2": "Let e be the agent's effort level, and let p(e) be the probability of success as a function of e. We are given that p(10) = 0.8 and p(20) = 0.9. Since effort is a continuous variable, we can assume that p(e) is a linear function of e. Thus, we can write p(e) = a * e + b, where a and b are constants.\n\nUsing the given values, we have two equations:\n\n0.8 = a * 10 + b\n0.9 = a * 20 + b\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that a = 0.01 and b = 0.7. So, p(e) = 0.01 * e + 0.7.\n\nNow, let's find the agent's payoff as a function of e. The agent's payoff is the probability of success times the value of success, plus the probability of failure times the value of failure, minus the cost of effort:\n\nPayoff(e) = p(e) * 80 + (1 - p(e)) * 20 - e\n\nSubstituting the expression for p(e), we get:\n\nPayoff(e) = (0.01 * e + 0.7) * 80 + (1 - (0.01 * e + 0.7)) * 20 - e\n\nTo find the optimal effort level, we need to maximize the agent's payoff. To do this, we can take the derivative of the Payoff(e) function with respect to e and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Payoff(e))/de = 0\n\nCalculating the derivative, we get:\n\n0.8 * e - 60 = 0\n\nSolving for e, we find that the optimal effort level is e = 75.\n\nNow, let's find the principal-agent welfare under this effort level. The welfare is the sum of the principal's and agent's payoffs. The principal's payoff is the probability of success times the value of success, plus the probability of failure times the value of failure:\n\nPrincipal_Payoff(e) = p(e) * 100 + (1 - p(e)) * 0\n\nSubstituting the expression for p(e) and the optimal effort level e = 75, we get:\n\nPrincipal_Payoff(75) = (0.01 * 75 + 0.7) * 100 = 85\n\nThe agent's payoff at the optimal effort level is:\n\nAgent_Payoff(75) = (0.01 * 75 + 0.7) * 80 + (1 - (0.01 * 75 + 0.7)) * 20 - 75 = 40\n\nSo, the principal-agent welfare under the optimal effort level is:\n\nWelfare = Principal_Payoff(75) + Agent_Payoff(75) = 85 + 40 = 125."
