    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we use the notation T_G(x, y), where x and y are variables. The Tutte polynomial can be computed recursively using the following rules:\n\n1. If G has no edges, then T_G(x, y) = x^(number of isolated vertices) * y^(number of connected components without isolated vertices).\n2. If G has an edge e that is not a bridge (i.e., its removal does not disconnect the graph), then T_G(x, y) = T_(G-e)(x, y), where G-e is the graph obtained by removing edge e from G.\n3. If G has a bridge e, then T_G(x, y) = x * T_(G/e)(x, y), where G/e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e in G.\n\nNow, let's find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G with five vertices and five edges. Since G has five edges, it must have at least one cycle. Let's consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: G has a 5-cycle (C5)\nIn this case, G is a simple cycle with five vertices and five edges. Since there are no bridges in a cycle, we can remove any edge e without disconnecting the graph. Therefore, T_G(x, y) = T_(G-e)(x, y), where G-e is a path with five vertices and four edges (P4). Now, we can remove another edge from P4 without disconnecting it, so T_(G-e)(x, y) = T_(P4-e')(x, y), where P4-e' is a path with five vertices and three edges (P3). Finally, removing one more edge from P3 will result in a disconnected graph with two connected components: a single vertex and a path with three vertices and two edges (P2). Thus, T_(P3-e'')(x, y) = x * T_(P2)(x, y) = x * (x^2 * y). Therefore, T_G(x, y) = x^3 * y.\n\nCase 2: G has a 4-cycle and a pendant edge\nIn this case, G has a 4-cycle with an additional edge connected to one of the vertices of the cycle. Since there are no bridges in a 4-cycle, we can remove any edge e from the cycle without disconnecting the graph. Therefore, T_G(x, y) = T_(G-e)(x, y), where G-e is a tree with five vertices and four edges. The Tutte polynomial of a tree T with n vertices is given by T_T(x, y) = x^(n-1). Thus, T_(G-e)(x, y) = x^4, and T_G(x, y) = x^4.\n\nCase 3: G has a 3-cycle and two pendant edges\nIn this case, G has a 3-cycle with two additional edges connected to one of the vertices of the cycle. Since there are no bridges in a 3-cycle, we can remove any edge e from the cycle without disconnecting the graph. Therefore, T_G(x, y) = T_(G-e)(x, y), where G-e is a tree with five vertices and four edges. As before, the Tutte polynomial of a tree T with n vertices is given by T_T(x, y) = x^(n-1). Thus, T_(G-e)(x, y) = x^4, and T_G(x, y) = x^4.\n\nSince these are all the possible cases for a simple undirected graph G with five vertices and five edges, we can conclude that the Tutte polynomial of G is either T_G(x, y) = x^3 * y (for a 5-cycle) or T_G(x, y) = x^4 (for a 4-cycle with a pendant edge or a 3-cycle with two pendant edges)."
