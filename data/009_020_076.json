The input u(t) is subject to the constraint:\n\n|u(t)| <= 1\n\nDetermine the optimal input u*(t) that minimizes the cost functional:\n\nJ(u) = ∫[0,T] (y(t) - r(t))^2 dt\n\nwhere T is a given time and r(t) is a given reference signal. \n\nFind the optimal value of J(u) and the corresponding input u*(t) that satisfies the constraint |u*(t)| <= 1 for all t.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, which is a necessary condition for an optimal control problem. The Hamiltonian for this problem is given by:\n\nH(y, λ, u, t) = (y - r(t))^2 + λ(t)(y''(t) + y(t) - u(t))\n\nwhere λ(t) is the costate variable. The necessary conditions for optimality are:\n\n1. ∂H/∂y = 0\n2. ∂H/∂λ = 0\n3. ∂H/∂u = 0\n\nFrom the first condition, we have:\n\n2(y - r(t)) + λ(t) = 0\n\nFrom the second condition, we have:\n\ny''(t) + y(t) - u(t) = 0\n\nFrom the third condition, we have:\n\n-λ(t) = 0\n\nSince |u(t)| <= 1, we have the following inequality:\n\n-1 <= u(t) <= 1\n\nNow, we have a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) with the following equations:\n\n1. y''(t) + y(t) = u(t)\n2. λ'(t) = -2(y(t) - r(t))\n3. -1 <= u(t) <= 1\n\nTo solve this TPBVP, we can use numerical methods such as the shooting method or the finite difference method. Once we find the optimal trajectory y*(t) and the corresponding costate λ*(t), we can find the optimal control input u*(t) using the following equation:\n\nu*(t) = y*(t) - y''*(t)\n\nFinally, we can find the optimal value of J(u) by substituting y*(t) into the cost functional:\n\nJ(u*) = ∫[0,T] (y*(t) - r(t))^2 dt"
