    "message_2": "The time complexity of the given algorithm is O(n), where n is the input size. This is because the algorithm iterates through all the numbers from 0 to n-1 using a for loop. The if statement and print operation inside the loop take constant time, so the overall complexity is determined by the loop, which is linear in the input size n."
