    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using complex analysis techniques, we will use the method of conformal mapping. First, we need to find a conformal mapping that maps the given rectangle to a simpler domain, such as the upper half-plane. \n\nLet's consider the conformal mapping $f(z) = \\frac{z - i}{z + i}$, where $z = x + iy$. This mapping maps the rectangle with vertices at $0, 1, i, 1+i$ to the upper half-plane. To see this, note that:\n\n$f(0) = -1, \\quad f(1) = 1, \\quad f(i) = 0, \\quad f(1+i) = \\infty$\n\nNow, let's find the inverse mapping $f^{-1}(w)$. Solving for $z$ in terms of $w$, we get:\n\n$z = f^{-1}(w) = \\frac{i(w + 1)}{w - 1}$\n\nNow, let's consider a harmonic function $v(w)$ in the upper half-plane that satisfies the boundary conditions. Since the boundary conditions are constant along the real axis, we can choose a simple linear function:\n\n$v(w) = \\operatorname{Re}(w)$\n\nNow, we can find the harmonic conjugate of $v(w)$, which is a function $u(w)$ such that $F(w) = u(w) + iv(w)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane. We can find $u(w)$ by solving the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nSince $v(w) = \\operatorname{Re}(w) = x$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$\n\nThus, the Cauchy-Riemann equations become:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -1$\n\nIntegrating these equations, we find that $u(w) = -y + C$, where $C$ is a constant. To satisfy the boundary conditions, we choose $C = 2$, so $u(w) = 2 - y$.\n\nNow, we can find the solution $u(z)$ to the original boundary value problem by composing $u(w)$ with the inverse mapping $f^{-1}(w)$:\n\n$u(z) = u(f^{-1}(w)) = 2 - \\operatorname{Im}(f^{-1}(w)) = 2 - \\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{i(w + 1)}{w - 1}\\right)$\n\nTo find the imaginary part of $f^{-1}(w)$, let $w = a + bi$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then:\n\n$\\operatorname{Im}(f^{-1}(w)) = \\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{i(a + bi + 1)}{(a + bi) - 1}\\right) = \\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{i(a + 1) - b}{(a - 1) + bi}\\right)$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, we get:\n\n$\\operatorname{Im}(f^{-1}(w)) = \\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{(i(a + 1) - b)((a - 1) - bi)}{(a - 1)^2 + b^2}\\right) = \\frac{b(a - 1) - (a + 1)(a - 1)}{(a - 1)^2 + b^2}$\n\nFinally, we can write the solution $u(x, y)$ to the boundary value problem as:\n\n$u(x, y) = 2 - \\frac{y(x - 1) - (x + 1)(x - 1)}{(x - 1)^2 + y^2}$"
