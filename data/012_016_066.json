    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph, we need to know the specific structure of the graph. The Tutte polynomial, denoted as T(x, y), is a two-variable polynomial that encodes various properties of the graph, such as the number of spanning trees, the number of connected components, and the chromatic polynomial.\n\nGiven that we have a graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges, there are multiple possible graphs with this configuration. Therefore, we cannot determine the Tutte polynomial without more information about the specific graph structure.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the graph, such as the adjacency matrix or a list of edges, we can then compute the Tutte polynomial for that specific graph."
