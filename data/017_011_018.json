    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 6 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2, so n_2 can be either 1 or 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 and a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. The order of P_3 is 3 and the order of P_2 is 4. Since the orders of P_3 and P_2 are coprime, by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_3 and P_2, which is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_4 ≅ Z_12. In this case, there is only one element of order 2, namely the element (1, 2) in the direct product notation.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 3\nIn this case, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3, which is normal in G, and three 2-Sylow subgroups. Let P_2 be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups. Since P_3 is normal in G, the product P_2P_3 is a subgroup of G. The order of P_2P_3 is |P_2||P_3|/|P_2 ∩ P_3| = 4 * 3 / 1 = 12, so P_2P_3 = G. Since P_2 is not normal in G, G cannot be a direct product of P_2 and P_3. Therefore, G must be a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. \n\nThere is only one nontrivial homomorphism from P_3 to Aut(P_2), since Aut(P_2) ≅ Z_2 and P_3 ≅ Z_3. This nontrivial homomorphism corresponds to the nonabelian semidirect product, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_6 of order 12. In this case, there are 6 elements of order 2, namely the reflections in D_6.\n\nCase 3: n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 1\nThis case is symmetric to Case 1, and G is isomorphic to Z_12.\n\nCase 4: n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 3\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and G is isomorphic to D_6.\n\nIn conclusion, there are exactly two non-isomorphic groups of order 12, namely Z_12 and D_6. These groups have different numbers of elements of order 2 (1 and 6, respectively), so any two groups of order 12 that are not isomorphic must have different numbers of elements of order 2."
