    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of arrangements of the letters in the word 'MATHEMATICS' and then subtract the arrangements where two consecutive letters are identical.\n\nThe word 'MATHEMATICS' has 11 letters with the following frequency of each letter:\nM: 2\nA: 2\nT: 2\nH: 1\nE: 1\nI: 1\nC: 1\nS: 1\n\nThe total number of arrangements of these letters can be found using the formula for permutations of a multiset: n!/(n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of elements and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of each element.\n\nIn this case, the total number of arrangements is:\n11! / (2! * 2! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 39,916,800 / 8 = 4,989,600\n\nNow, we need to subtract the arrangements where two consecutive letters are identical. Since there are only three pairs of identical letters (M, A, and T), we can consider each case separately and then use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the total number of invalid arrangements.\n\nCase 1: Two consecutive M's\nWe can treat the two M's as a single unit, so we have 10 units to arrange: {MM, A, T, H, E, I, C, S, A, T}. The number of arrangements for these units is:\n10! / (2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 2!) = 3,628,800 / 4 = 907,200\n\nCase 2: Two consecutive A's\nWe can treat the two A's as a single unit, so we have 10 units to arrange: {M, AA, T, H, E, I, C, S, M, T}. The number of arrangements for these units is:\n10! / (1! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 2!) = 3,628,800 / 4 = 907,200\n\nCase 3: Two consecutive T's\nWe can treat the two T's as a single unit, so we have 10 units to arrange: {M, A, TT, H, E, I, C, S, M, A}. The number of arrangements for these units is:\n10! / (2! * 1! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 3,628,800 / 4 = 907,200\n\nNow we need to consider the cases where two or more pairs of consecutive identical letters occur simultaneously.\n\nCase 4: Two consecutive M's and two consecutive A's\nWe can treat the two M's and two A's as single units, so we have 9 units to arrange: {MM, AA, T, H, E, I, C, S, T}. The number of arrangements for these units is:\n9! / (1! * 1! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 362,880 / 2 = 181,440\n\nCase 5: Two consecutive M's and two consecutive T's\nWe can treat the two M's and two T's as single units, so we have 9 units to arrange: {MM, A, TT, H, E, I, C, S, A}. The number of arrangements for these units is:\n9! / (1! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 362,880 / 2 = 181,440\n\nCase 6: Two consecutive A's and two consecutive T's\nWe can treat the two A's and two T's as single units, so we have 9 units to arrange: {M, AA, TT, H, E, I, C, S, M}. The number of arrangements for these units is:\n9! / (2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 362,880 / 2 = 181,440\n\nCase 7: Two consecutive M's, two consecutive A's, and two consecutive T's\nWe can treat all three pairs of identical letters as single units, so we have 8 units to arrange: {MM, AA, TT, H, E, I, C, S}. The number of arrangements for these units is:\n8! / (1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 40,320\n\nNow, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the total number of invalid arrangements:\nInvalid arrangements = (Case 1 + Case 2 + Case 3) - (Case 4 + Case 5 + Case 6) + Case 7\nInvalid arrangements = (907,200 + 907,200 + 907,200) - (181,440 + 181,440 + 181,440) + 40,320\nInvalid arrangements = 2,721,600 - 544,320 + 40,320\nInvalid arrangements = 2,177,280\n\nFinally, we can subtract the invalid arrangements from the total number of arrangements to find the number of valid arrangements:\nValid arrangements = Total arrangements - Invalid arrangements\nValid arrangements = 4,989,600 - 2,177,280\nValid arrangements = 2,812,320\n\nSo, there are 2,812,320 ways to arrange the letters in the word 'MATHEMATICS' such that no two consecutive letters are identical."
