    "message_2": "To find the isomorphism type of a group G of order 18, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. \n\nLet's first consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 (the index of 2 in the factorization of 18) and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. \n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2 (the index of 3^2 in the factorization of 18) and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possible value for n_3 is 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let's denote this normal subgroup as H. The order of H is 9 (3^2). Since the order of H is a prime power, H is isomorphic to either the cyclic group Z_9 or the non-abelian group of order 9 (which does not exist). Therefore, H is isomorphic to Z_9.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G. If n_2 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let's denote this normal subgroup as K. The order of K is 2. Since the order of K is prime, K is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_2.\n\nIn this case, G has two normal subgroups, H and K, with orders 9 and 2, respectively. Since their orders are coprime, G is the internal direct product of H and K. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the external direct product of Z_9 and Z_2, which is Z_18.\n\nIf n_2 = 9, then there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them is normal in G. In this case, we can use the semidirect product to construct G. Since H is normal in G and K is not, G is a semidirect product of H and K. The action of K on H is determined by an automorphism of H. The automorphism group of H (which is isomorphic to Z_9) is Z_6. There are two possible actions of K on H: the trivial action and the non-trivial action.\n\nIf the action is trivial, then G is the direct product of H and K, which is Z_18, as we found before. If the action is non-trivial, then G is a non-abelian group of order 18. This group is unique up to isomorphism and is denoted as D_18, the dihedral group of order 18.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either Z_18 or D_18."
