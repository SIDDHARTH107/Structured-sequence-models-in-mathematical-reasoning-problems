    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height of the tower) to the adjacent side (distance from the student to the tower) in a right-angled triangle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the student to the tower is 50 meters. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\ntan(45Â°) = height / 50\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 50\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the tower:\n\nheight = 50 * 1\n\nheight = 50 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tower is 50 meters."
