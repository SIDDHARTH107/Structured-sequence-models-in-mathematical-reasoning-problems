    "message_2": "According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if p is a prime number and a is a positive integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. In other words:\n\na^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nNow, if we multiply both sides of this congruence by a, we get:\n\na^p ≡ a (mod p)\n\nThis means that when a^p is divided by p, the remainder is a."
