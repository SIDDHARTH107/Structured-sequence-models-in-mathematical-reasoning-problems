    "message_2": "To find the decryption key d, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Find the decryption key d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. n = p * q = 13 * 19 = 247\n2. φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (13-1) * (19-1) = 12 * 18 = 216\n3. Find d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1, where e = 5\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)):\n\n5 * d ≡ 1 (mod 216)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 173.\n\nSo, the decryption key d is 173."
