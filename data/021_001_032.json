    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n3. Use back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 1  2  1 | 3 |\n| 2 -1  3 | 1 |\n| 3 -1 -1 | 2 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the '2' in the second row and the '3' in the third row of the first column. To do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 3*R1\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n|  1  2   1 |  3  |\n|  0 -5   1 | -5  |\n|  0 -7  -4 | -7  |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the '-7' in the third row of the second column. To do this, we will perform the following row operation:\n\nR3 = R3 - (7/5)*R2\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n|  1  2   1  |  3   |\n|  0 -5   1  | -5   |\n|  0  0  -3  |  0   |\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 3: Use back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n-3z = 0 => z = 0\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-5y + z = -5 => -5y + 0 = -5 => y = 1\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\nx + 2y + z = 3 => x + 2(1) + 0 = 3 => x = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 1, and z = 0."
