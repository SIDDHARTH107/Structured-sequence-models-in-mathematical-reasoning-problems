They simultaneously set prices for their products. If both firms set the same price, they split the market equally. If one firm sets a lower price, it captures the entire market. What price will each firm set?\n\nCalculate the Nash Equilibrium for this game and find the optimal price for each firm.",
    "message_2": "In this Bertrand Competition, both firms have the same cost of production, which is $10. To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to analyze the best response functions of both firms.\n\nLet pA be the price set by Firm A and pB be the price set by Firm B.\n\nCase 1: pA = pB\nIn this case, both firms set the same price and split the market equally. Their profits will be positive as long as the price is above the cost of production, which is $10.\n\nCase 2: pA < pB\nIn this case, Firm A sets a lower price and captures the entire market. Firm A's profit will be positive as long as pA > $10.\n\nCase 3: pA > pB\nIn this case, Firm B sets a lower price and captures the entire market. Firm B's profit will be positive as long as pB > $10.\n\nNow, let's find the Nash Equilibrium by analyzing the best response functions:\n\n- Firm A's best response is to set a price slightly below pB, as long as pA > $10.\n- Firm B's best response is to set a price slightly below pA, as long as pB > $10.\n\nIn the Nash Equilibrium, both firms will set a price equal to their cost of production, which is $10. This is because if one firm tries to set a price above $10, the other firm will undercut it by setting a price slightly below, capturing the entire market. If a firm sets a price below $10, it will make a loss.\n\nSo, the Nash Equilibrium in this Bertrand Competition is pA = pB = $10. Both firms will set their prices at $10, which is the optimal price for each firm."
