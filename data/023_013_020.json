    "message_1": "A metal plate of thickness 1 cm initially at 100°C is exposed to a constant heat flux of 10 kW/m² on one side while the other side of the plate is perfectly insulated. Find the temperature distribution T(x) at a distance of 5 cm from the heated surface after 5 minutes. Use Fourier transform to solve the heat transfer problem assuming that the plate has uniform thermal properties and neglecting any heat loss to the surrounding environment.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation with constant thermal properties and Fourier transform. The heat conduction equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the distance from the heated surface.\n\nFirst, let's apply the boundary and initial conditions:\n\n1. At x = 0, the heat flux is given as q = -k ∂T/∂x = 10 kW/m², where k is the thermal conductivity of the material.\n2. At x = 1 cm, the plate is perfectly insulated, so ∂T/∂x = 0.\n3. Initially, the plate is at a uniform temperature of 100°C.\n\nNow, let's apply the Fourier transform to the heat conduction equation. We will use the symbol F{ } to represent the Fourier transform:\n\nF{∂T/∂t} = α F{∂²T/∂x²}\n\nLet T(x, t) = F^-1{Θ(k, t)}, where F^-1{ } is the inverse Fourier transform. Then, we have:\n\n∂(F^-1{Θ})/∂t = α ∂²(F^-1{Θ})/∂x²\n\nApplying the Fourier transform properties, we get:\n\nF{∂(F^-1{Θ})/∂t} = α F{∂²(F^-1{Θ})/∂x²}\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n∂Θ/∂t = -α k² Θ\n\nSolving this ordinary differential equation, we get:\n\nΘ(k, t) = Θ₀(k) e^(-α k² t)\n\nNow, we need to find Θ₀(k) using the initial condition T(x, 0) = 100°C:\n\nΘ₀(k) = F{T(x, 0)} = F{100}\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution in the Fourier domain as:\n\nΘ(k, t) = F{100} e^(-α k² t)\n\nTo find the temperature distribution in the spatial domain, we need to apply the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nT(x, t) = F^-1{Θ(k, t)}\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution T(x) at a distance of 5 cm from the heated surface after 5 minutes:\n\nT(0.05 m, 300 s) = F^-1{F{100} e^(-α k² (300 s))}\n\nTo find the numerical value of T(0.05 m, 300 s), we need to know the thermal diffusivity α and perform the inverse Fourier transform. The thermal diffusivity depends on the material properties (thermal conductivity, specific heat, and density) and can be found in the literature or through experiments. Once α is known, the inverse Fourier transform can be performed numerically to find the temperature distribution T(x) at the desired location and time."
