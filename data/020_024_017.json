The company has determined that the demand function for this product is given by: \n\np = 100 - 0.5q\n\nwhere p is the price and q is the quantity demanded. \n\nWhat is the optimal price to maximize the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize the company's profit, we first need to find the revenue function and then the profit function.\n\nRevenue (R) is given by the product of price (p) and quantity (q):\n\nR = pq\n\nWe are given the demand function:\n\np = 100 - 0.5q\n\nWe can substitute this into the revenue function:\n\nR = (100 - 0.5q)q\nR = 100q - 0.5q^2\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function. Profit (P) is given by the difference between revenue (R) and cost (C):\n\nP = R - C\n\nThe cost function is given by the cost of manufacturing ($30) times the quantity produced (q):\n\nC = 30q\n\nNow, we can find the profit function:\n\nP = (100q - 0.5q^2) - 30q\nP = 70q - 0.5q^2\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative with respect to q and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndP/dq = 70 - q\n\nNow, set dP/dq = 0 and solve for q:\n\n70 - q = 0\nq = 70\n\nNow, we can find the optimal price by plugging this value of q back into the demand function:\n\np = 100 - 0.5(70)\np = 100 - 35\np = $65\n\nThe optimal price to maximize the company's profit is $65."
