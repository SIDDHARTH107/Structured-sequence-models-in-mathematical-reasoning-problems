    "message_2": "First, let's recall the definitions of connected and path-connected spaces.\n\nConnected: A topological space X is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets.\n\nPath-connected: A topological space X is path-connected if for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given topological space X.\n\nConnectedness:\nConsider the two open sets A = (0, 1) and B = (2, 3) in X. Note that A and B are disjoint, non-empty, and their union is X. Since X can be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets, X is not connected.\n\nPath-connectedness:\nTo show that X is not path-connected, we need to find two points in X for which there is no continuous path between them. Let x = 1 and y = 2. Suppose there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nSince f is continuous and [0,1] is connected, the image of f, f([0,1]), must also be connected. However, f([0,1]) contains both x and y, and since X is not connected, f([0,1]) must intersect both intervals [0,1] and [2,3]. This means that there must be a point z in f([0,1]) such that z ∈ (1, 2). But this is a contradiction, as X does not contain any points in the interval (1, 2). Therefore, there cannot be a continuous function f connecting x and y, and X is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the topological space X = [0,1] ∪ [2,3] is neither connected nor path-connected."
