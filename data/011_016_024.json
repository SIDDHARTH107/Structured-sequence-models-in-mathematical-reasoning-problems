    "message_1": "How many different ways are there to distribute 10 identical balls into 5 distinct boxes, such that each box contains at least 1 ball?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the stars and bars method. Since each of the 5 distinct boxes must contain at least 1 ball, we can first place 1 ball in each box. Now, we have 5 balls left to distribute among the 5 boxes.\n\nWe can think of this as placing 4 \"dividers\" between the 5 balls to separate them into the 5 boxes. For example, if we have the balls represented as O and the dividers as |, we can have a configuration like this:\n\nO|OO|O|OO|O\n\nThis represents 1 ball in the first box, 2 in the second, 1 in the third, 2 in the fourth, and 1 in the fifth.\n\nNow, we just need to count the number of ways to arrange the 5 balls and 4 dividers. There are a total of 9 positions (5 balls + 4 dividers), and we need to choose 4 of them to be dividers.\n\nSo, the number of ways to distribute the 10 identical balls into the 5 distinct boxes, such that each box contains at least 1 ball, is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!5!) = 126\n\nTherefore, there are 126 different ways to distribute the 10 identical balls into the 5 distinct boxes, such that each box contains at least 1 ball."
