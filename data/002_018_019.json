    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. \n\nDiameter of the sphere = side length of the cube = 6 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere:\n\nRadius = Diameter / 2 = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm\n\nNext, we'll use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 27 cm^3\nVolume = 36π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is 36π cubic centimeters."
