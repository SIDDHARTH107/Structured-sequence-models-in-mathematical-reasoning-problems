Here's a precise numerical problem for a student in Numerical Analysis studying the Simulated Annealing method:\n\nSuppose a company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The profit of Product A is $20 per unit and the profit of Product B is $15 per unit. The company can produce a maximum of 1000 units of Product A and 800 units of Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 5 hours of labor and each unit of Product B requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a total of 4000 labor hours available. Using the simulated annealing method, determine the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce in order to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and the initial solution.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 20A + 15B\nConstraints:\n1. A <= 1000\n2. B <= 800\n3. 5A + 3B <= 4000\n\nInitial solution: Let's start with producing 0 units of both products (A=0, B=0).\n\nNow, we will implement the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Set initial temperature T and cooling rate alpha.\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution by slightly changing the values of A and B within the constraints.\n3. Calculate the change in profit (delta_P) between the new solution and the current solution.\n4. If delta_P > 0, accept the new solution. If delta_P < 0, accept the new solution with probability exp(delta_P/T).\n5. Update the temperature by multiplying it with the cooling rate (T = alpha * T).\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the temperature is below a certain threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce to maximize profit. Note that the result may not be the exact optimal solution, as simulated annealing is a heuristic algorithm that provides an approximation to the optimal solution. However, it is generally effective in finding good solutions for complex optimization problems."
