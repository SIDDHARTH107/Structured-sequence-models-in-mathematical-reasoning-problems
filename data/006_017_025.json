    "message_1": "A study found that the probability of a car accident happening on a particular road is 0.2. If 100 cars drive on this road in one day, what is the probability that more than 25 of them will be involved in an accident?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, accidents) in n trials (cars)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a single success (accident), which is 0.2\n- n is the number of trials (cars), which is 100\n- k is the number of successes (accidents) we're interested in\n\nWe want to find the probability that more than 25 cars will be involved in an accident, so we need to find the probability for each value of k from 26 to 100 and then sum those probabilities.\n\nP(X > 25) = P(X = 26) + P(X = 27) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nCalculating each of these probabilities using the binomial formula and summing them up:\n\nP(X > 25) ≈ 0.0003 + 0.0006 + ... + 0.0000 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nP(X > 25) ≈ 0.0388\n\nSo, the probability that more than 25 cars will be involved in an accident on this road in one day is approximately 0.0388 or 3.88%."
