    "message_1": "Suppose two players are participating in a sealed-bid auction for an item with a true value of $100. Player 1 has a valuation of $80 while player 2 has a valuation of $120. What is the optimal auction mechanism for a seller who wishes to maximize their revenue?",
    "message_2": "The optimal auction mechanism for a seller who wishes to maximize their revenue in this scenario is the second-price (Vickrey) auction. In a second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the item, but they pay the price of the second-highest bid.\n\nIn this case, Player 1 would bid $80, and Player 2 would bid $120. Player 2 would win the auction since their bid is higher, but they would pay the price of the second-highest bid, which is $80. This auction mechanism encourages both players to bid their true valuations, as they know they will only pay the second-highest bid if they win.\n\nThe seller maximizes their revenue by receiving the highest possible payment from the winning bidder without overcharging them, which is $80 in this case."
