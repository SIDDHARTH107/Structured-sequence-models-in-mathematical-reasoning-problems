    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C respectively. In this case, we have a = 5, b = 7, and c = 9. We want to find the largest angle, which will be the angle opposite to the longest side (c = 9). So, we want to find angle C.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c:\n\n9² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(C)\n\n81 = 25 + 49 - 70 * cos(C)\n\n7 = 74 - 70 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we'll isolate cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (74 - 7) / 70\ncos(C) = 67 / 70\n\nNow, we'll find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nC = arccos(67/70)\n\nC ≈ 26.4°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 26.4°."
