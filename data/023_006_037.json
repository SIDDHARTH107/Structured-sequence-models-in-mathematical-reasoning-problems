    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of the signal, we need to compute the inverse Fourier transform integral. The inverse Fourier transform formula is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[F(w) * e^(jwt)] dw, where the integral is taken over the entire frequency domain.\n\nFor the given signal, F(w) = 2 / (1 + jw). So, we need to compute:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[(2 / (1 + jw)) * e^(jwt)] dw\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the residue theorem from complex analysis. First, we need to find the poles of the integrand function. The poles are the values of w for which the denominator (1 + jw) becomes zero:\n\n1 + jw = 0\nw = -1/j = j\n\nSo, there is one pole at w = j. Now, we need to find the residue at this pole. The residue is given by:\n\nResidue = lim(w->j) [(w - j) * (2 / (1 + jw)) * e^(jwt)]\n\nTo compute this limit, we can use L'Hopital's rule:\n\nResidue = lim(w->j) [d/dw((w - j) * (2 / (1 + jw)) * e^(jwt))]\n\nDifferentiating with respect to w, we get:\n\nResidue = lim(w->j) [2e^(jwt) / (1 + jw)^2]\n\nNow, substituting w = j:\n\nResidue = 2e^(j^2t) / (1 + j^2)^2 = 2e^(-t) / (1 - 1)^2 = 2e^(-t)\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to compute the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * 2π * Residue = 2e^(-t) for t > 0\n\nSo, the inverse Fourier transform of the signal F(w) = 2 / (1 + jw) is:\n\nf(t) = 2e^(-t) for t > 0, and f(t) = 0 for t ≤ 0."
