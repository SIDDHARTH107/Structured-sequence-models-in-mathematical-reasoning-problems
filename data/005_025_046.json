    "message_2": "To find the probability that the mean weight of the sample is between 117 and 123 grams, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the mean weight (μ) is 120 grams and the standard deviation (σ) is 8 grams, we can find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean using the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere n is the sample size.\n\nSE = 8 / √50 ≈ 1.131\n\nNow, we can find the z-scores for the given range of sample mean weights (117 and 123 grams) using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nFor x = 117 grams:\n\nz1 = (117 - 120) / 1.131 ≈ -2.656\n\nFor x = 123 grams:\n\nz2 = (123 - 120) / 1.131 ≈ 2.656\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score lies between z1 and z2. We can use a z-table or calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(z1 < z < z2) = P(-2.656 < z < 2.656)\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(-2.656 < z < 2.656) ≈ 0.9918\n\nSo, there is approximately a 99.18% probability that the mean weight of the sample of 50 bananas is between 117 and 123 grams."
