    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 27 = 3^3. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be normal in G (by the second Sylow theorem). Let P be this unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. By the classification of groups of order p^2 (where p is prime), P must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. In either case, P has an element of order 9 (either a generator of the cyclic group or the product of generators of the two cyclic groups of order 3). Let x be an element of order 9 in P.\n\nNow, G has an element of order 3 that is not in P (since the order of G is 3^3 and the order of P is 3^2). Let y be such an element. Then, the order of the element xy must be 9 (since the orders of x and y are relatively prime). Thus, G has elements of order 3 and 9, and since 3 and 9 are relatively prime, G must have an element of order 3 * 9 = 27. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, let P, Q, and R be distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since the intersection of distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element), the intersection of any two of P, Q, and R must be trivial. Thus, the product PQ contains 9 * 9 - 1 = 80 non-identity elements of G. Similarly, the product PR and QR contain 80 non-identity elements each. Since G has 27 - 1 = 26 non-identity elements, the products PQ, PR, and QR must account for all non-identity elements of G. Therefore, G must be the union of P, Q, and R.\n\nLet H = PQ. Then, H is a subgroup of G containing P and Q. The order of H is at least 9 (since it contains P) and at most 27 (since it is a subgroup of G). If the order of H is 27, then H = G, and G is the direct product of P and Q (since P and Q are normal in G). In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIf the order of H is 9, then H is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, H must be equal to one of P, Q, or R. Without loss of generality, assume H = P. Then, Q is a subgroup of P, which contradicts the fact that P and Q are distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. Therefore, the order of H cannot be 9, and G must be isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
