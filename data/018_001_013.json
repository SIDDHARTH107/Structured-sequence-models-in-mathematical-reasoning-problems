    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element in A. The empty set, denoted by ∅, is a set that contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that we need to check for membership in A.\n\nBy definition, a subset B of a set A is a set such that every element of B is also an element of A. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nB ⊆ A if and only if ∀x (x ∈ B → x ∈ A)\n\nNow, let's consider the empty set ∅ as our subset B. Since there are no elements in ∅, there are no elements x such that x ∈ ∅. Consequently, the statement \"x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A\" is vacuously true for all x, as there is no x that can make the premise (x ∈ ∅) true.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the empty set ∅ is a subset of A, as every element in the empty set (which are none) is also an element in A. In other words, ∅ ⊆ A."
