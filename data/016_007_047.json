    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. At each iteration, the volume of the Menger sponge decreases. The volume of a Menger sponge at the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = a^3 * (20/27)^n\n\nwhere a is the side length of the initial cube and n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the fifth iteration (n = 5), the volume of the Menger sponge is:\n\nVolume = a^3 * (20/27)^5\n\nWithout knowing the side length (a) of the initial cube, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the volume. However, you can plug in the value of a to find the volume for a specific Menger sponge at the fifth iteration."
