    "message_2": "a) The set S is defined by the equation (x₁ - 1)² + x₂² = 1. This equation represents a circle centered at (1, 0) with radius 1 in the plane R². We can rewrite the equation as a level set of a smooth function F: R² → R, where F(x₁, x₂) = (x₁ - 1)² + x₂² - 1. The gradient of F is given by ∇F = (2(x₁ - 1), 2x₂). Since the gradient is non-zero for all points on the circle, S is a smooth manifold of dimension 1 by the Implicit Function Theorem.\n\nb) The function f: S → R is defined by f(x) = x₁. Since f is just the projection onto the first coordinate, it is a smooth function. To see this, note that f is the restriction of the smooth function F₁: R² → R, where F₁(x₁, x₂) = x₁, to the set S. Since F₁ is smooth, its restriction to S is also smooth.\n\nc) To compute the tangent space to S at the point p = (0, 1), we first find the gradient of F at p, which is ∇F(p) = (2(0 - 1), 2(1)) = (-2, 2). The tangent space T_p(S) is the orthogonal complement of the gradient at p. In R², the orthogonal complement of a vector (a, b) is given by (-b, a) or (b, -a). Therefore, the tangent space T_p(S) is spanned by the vector (2, 2) or (-2, -2). We can choose either one as the basis for the tangent space. For simplicity, we can choose the basis vector (2, 2), so T_p(S) = {(2t, 2t) | t ∈ R}."
