Consider that the values in the first equation are uncertain by ±0.5, in the second equation the values are uncertain by ±0.3, and in the third equation the values are uncertain by ±0.2. \n\nUsing the method of least squares, find the best approximation of the solution for the given system of equations.",
    "message_2": "To find the best approximation of the solution for the given system of equations using the method of least squares, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the system of equations in matrix form: AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants (23, 34, 54).\n\nA = | 2  3  5 |\n    | 4  5  6 |\n    | 7  8  9 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 23 |\n    | 34 |\n    | 54 |\n\n2.
