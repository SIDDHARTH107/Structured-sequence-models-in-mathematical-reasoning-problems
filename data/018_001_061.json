    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set ∅ is a subset of A.\n\nTo prove this, we need to show that every element in the empty set ∅ is also an element of A. Since there are no elements in the empty set, this statement is vacuously true. Therefore, the empty set ∅ is a subset of any set, including A = {1, 2, 3, 4}."
