    "message_2": "First, let's prove that for any object E of D(X), we have Hom(E, E) = End(E).\n\nRecall that the derived category D(X) is a triangulated category, and Hom(E, E) denotes the set of morphisms from E to E in D(X). The endomorphism ring End(E) is the set of endomorphisms of E as an object in the abelian category of coherent sheaves on X.\n\nNow, let E be an object in D(X). Since X is a smooth projective curve, the category of coherent sheaves on X is abelian. Therefore, any morphism in Hom(E, E) is a chain map of complexes of coherent sheaves on X. Moreover, since E is an object in D(X), it is isomorphic to a bounded complex of coherent sheaves. Thus, any morphism in Hom(E, E) induces an endomorphism of E in the category of coherent sheaves on X, which is an element of End(E).\n\nConversely, any endomorphism of E in the category of coherent sheaves on X can be lifted to a chain map of complexes of coherent sheaves on X, which is a morphism in Hom(E, E). Therefore, we have Hom(E, E) = End(E).\n\nNow, let's provide an example of a smooth projective curve X over the field of complex numbers, and a non-trivial object E in D(X), for which Hom(E, E) is strictly larger than End(E).\n\nConsider the projective line X = P^1 over the field of complex numbers. Let E be the direct sum of two line bundles, E = O ⊕ O(1), where O is the structure sheaf of X and O(1) is the Serre twist of O. Note that E is a non-trivial object in D(X).\n\nWe claim that Hom(E, E) is strictly larger than End(E). To see this, consider the following short exact sequence of coherent sheaves on X:\n\n0 → O → E → O(1) → 0.\n\nThis short exact sequence induces a long exact sequence in the derived category D(X):\n\n... → Hom(E, O) → Hom(E, E) → Hom(E, O(1)) → Ext^1(E, O) → ...\n\nSince X = P^1 is a smooth projective curve, we have Hom(E, O) = 0 and Hom(E, O(1)) = 0. Therefore, the long exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → Hom(E, E) → Ext^1(E, O) → ...\n\nNow, Ext^1(E, O) is non-zero because the short exact sequence above is non-split. Thus, Hom(E, E) contains strictly more elements than End(E), as claimed."
