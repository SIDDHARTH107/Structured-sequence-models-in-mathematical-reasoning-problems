    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate how many machines they should purchase to meet the demand of their customers. The monthly demand for machines follows a normal distribution with a mean of 800 and a standard deviation of 100. The cost of each machine is $10,000. Perform a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 trials to estimate the number of machines the company should purchase to meet the demand with 95% probability.",
    "message_2": "To perform a Monte Carlo simulation, we will generate random samples from the normal distribution with a mean of 800 and a standard deviation of 100. We will then calculate the number of machines needed to meet the demand in each trial and find the value that meets the demand with 95% probability.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Import necessary libraries (numpy and scipy.stats)\n2. Set the parameters for the normal distribution (mean = 800, standard deviation = 100)\n3. Set the number of trials (10,000)\n4. Generate random samples from the normal distribution for each trial\n5. Calculate the number of machines needed to meet the demand in each trial\n6. Find the 95th percentile of the number of machines needed\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\n# Parameters\nmean_demand = 800\nstd_dev_demand = 100\nnum_trials = 10000\n\n# Generate random samples from the normal distribution\nrandom_demands = np.random.normal(mean_demand, std_dev_demand, num_trials)\n\n# Calculate the number of machines needed to meet the demand in each trial\nmachines_needed = np.ceil(random_demands)\n\n# Find the 95th percentile of the number of machines needed\nmachines_95_percentile = np.percentile(machines_needed, 95)\n\nprint(\"The company should purchase approximately\", int(machines_95_percentile), \"machines to meet the demand with 95% probability.\")\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, the output will give an estimate of the number of machines the company should purchase to meet the demand with 95% probability. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the simulation."
