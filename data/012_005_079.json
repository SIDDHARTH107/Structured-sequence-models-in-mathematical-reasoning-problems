    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. First, let's analyze the properties of the graph.\n\nA connected graph with 9 vertices (n = 9) must have at least n - 1 = 8 edges to be connected. Our graph has 12 edges, which is 4 more than the minimum required for connectivity. \n\nNow, let's consider the best-case scenario for the diameter, which would be a tree (acyclic connected graph) with all vertices having the minimum possible degree. In this case, the graph would look like a binary tree with 9 vertices:\n\n```\n        1\n       / \\\n      2   3\n     / \\ / \\\n    4  5 6  7\n   /\n  8\n /\n9\n```\n\nIn this best-case scenario, the diameter would be 4 (the longest shortest path is between vertices 9 and 7, passing through vertices 8, 2, and 3).\n\nHowever, our graph has 12 edges, which means it has 3 more edges than this best-case scenario. Adding edges to the graph can only decrease the diameter, as it creates additional paths between vertices. Therefore, the diameter of the graph must be less than or equal to 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario for the diameter, which would be a tree with the maximum possible diameter for a graph with 9 vertices:\n\n```\n1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9\n```\n\nIn this case, the diameter is 8. However, our graph has 12 edges, which means it has 3 more edges than this worst-case scenario. Adding 3 edges to this graph will create cycles and shorten some paths between vertices, which will decrease the diameter.\n\nFor example, adding an edge between vertices 3 and 7:\n\n```\n1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9\n    |       |\n    +-------+\n```\n\nThis reduces the diameter to 6 (e.g., the longest shortest path is between vertices 1 and 9). We can further reduce the diameter by adding an edge between vertices 2 and 6:\n\n```\n1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9\n  |   |   |   |\n  +---+---+---+\n```\n\nNow the diameter is 4 (e.g., the longest shortest path is between vertices 1 and 9, passing through vertices 2 and 6). Adding one more edge cannot reduce the diameter further, as it would create a cycle of length 3, which is not possible in a graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the graph is 4."
