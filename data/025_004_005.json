    "message_2": "To determine the degree of the curve $C$, we first need to find the degree of the polynomials defining the curve. The degree of a rational curve is the maximum degree of the numerator and denominator of its defining functions. \n\nFor $x$, we have the numerator $t^3 - 3t$ and the denominator $t^2 + 1$. The degree of the numerator is 3 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Therefore, the degree of $x$ is max(3, 2) = 3.\n\nFor $y$, we have the numerator $3t^2 - 1$ and the denominator $t^2 + 1$. The degree of the numerator is 2 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Therefore, the degree of $y$ is max(2, 2) = 2.\n\nSince the degree of $x$ is greater than the degree of $y$, the degree of the curve $C$ is 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the singular points of the curve $C$. A singular point is a point where the partial derivatives of the curve with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of the curve with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} = \\frac{(3t^2 - 3)(t^2 + 1) - (t^3 - 3t)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \\frac{6t^3 - 6t - 2t^4 + 6t^2}{(t^2 + 1)^2}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} = \\frac{(6t)(t^2 + 1) - (3t^2 - 1)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \\frac{6t^3 + 6t - 6t^3 + 2t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \\frac{8t}{(t^2 + 1)^2}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $t$ for which both $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}$ and $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t}$ are zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} = 0 \\Rightarrow 6t^3 - 6t - 2t^4 + 6t^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2t^4 - 6t^3 + 6t^2 - 6t = 0 \\Rightarrow t(2t^3 - 6t^2 + 6t - 6) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} = 0 \\Rightarrow 8t = 0 \\Rightarrow t = 0$\n\nSince $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}$ is always zero, we only need to consider the values of $t$ for which both $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}$ and $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t}$ are zero. We found that $t = 0$ is the only such value.\n\nNow, we can find the singular point of the curve $C$ by plugging $t = 0$ into the parametric equations:\n\n$x = \\frac{(0)^3 - 3(0)}{(0)^2 + 1} = 0$\n\n$y = \\frac{3(0)^2 - 1}{(0)^2 + 1} = -1$\n\n$z = 1$\n\nTherefore, the singular point of the curve $C$ is $(0, -1, 1)$."
