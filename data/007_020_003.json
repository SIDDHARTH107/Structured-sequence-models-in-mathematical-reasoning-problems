    "message_1": "Here's a question for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you have to send a secret message to your friend using an RSA encryption system. Your public key is (25, 341) and the message you want to send is \"13\". What will be the encrypted message that you will send to your friend?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using RSA encryption, we need to use the public key (e, n) provided, which in this case is (25, 341). The message to be encrypted is \"13\". We will represent this message as an integer, so M = 13.\n\nThe encryption formula for RSA is:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nwhere C is the encrypted message, M is the original message, e is the public exponent, and n is the modulus.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nC ≡ 13^25 (mod 341)\n\nCalculating 13^25 can result in a very large number, so we can use the \"modular exponentiation\" technique to simplify the calculation:\n\nC ≡ 13^25 (mod 341) ≡ 13^(16+8+1) (mod 341) ≡ (13^16 * 13^8 * 13^1) (mod 341)\n\nNow, we can calculate each part separately:\n\n13^1 (mod 341) ≡ 13\n13^8 (mod 341) ≡ 169\n13^16 (mod 341) ≡ 187\n\nNow, multiply these results together and take the modulus:\n\nC ≡ (13 * 169 * 187) (mod 341) ≡ 411979 (mod 341) ≡ 87\n\nSo, the encrypted message C that you will send to your friend is \"87\"."
