    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces electronic devices, and the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring during the manufacturing process is 0.08. If the company is producing 5000 of these devices, what is the expected number of defective products produced?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of defective products, we can multiply the probability of the defect occurring by the total number of devices being produced.\n\nExpected number of defective products = Probability of defect * Total number of devices\nExpected number of defective products = 0.08 * 5000\nExpected number of defective products = 400\n\nSo, the expected number of defective products produced is 400."
