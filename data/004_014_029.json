    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the curves y = x^2, y = 0, x = 0, and x = 2 about the y-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of the cross-sectional disks along the axis of rotation.\n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y, since we are rotating around the y-axis. From the equation y = x^2, we can solve for x:\n\nx = sqrt(y)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral using the disk method. The area of each disk is given by A(y) = πr^2, where r is the distance from the axis of rotation to the curve. In this case, r = x = sqrt(y). So, the area of each disk is:\n\nA(y) = π(sqrt(y))^2 = πy\n\nNow, we integrate A(y) along the y-axis from y = 0 to y = 4 (since x = 2 corresponds to y = 2^2 = 4):\n\nVolume = ∫[0, 4] A(y) dy = ∫[0, 4] πy dy\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nVolume = π ∫[0, 4] y dy = π [y^2/2] | (from 0 to 4)\n\nVolume = π [(4^2/2) - (0^2/2)] = π (16/2) = 8π\n\nSo, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the curves y = x^2, y = 0, x = 0, and x = 2 about the y-axis is 8π cubic units."
