    "message_2": "To compute $d(3)$ and $d(4)$, we first need to understand the geometry of the quintic equation and the fixed points of the involution.\n\nThe quintic equation given is a degree 5 hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. The involution $x_i \\mapsto -x_i$ has five fixed points, which are the coordinate points $[1:0:0:0:0], [0:1:0:0:0], [0:0:1:0:0], [0:0:0:1:0],$ and $[0:0:0:0:1]$.\n\nNow, let's consider the degree $n$ hypersurface sections cut out by hyperplanes in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ that contain exactly one of the five fixed points of the involution. We will use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to compute the number of such sections.\n\nFor $d(3)$, we consider degree 3 hypersurface sections. By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the Hodge numbers of the quintic threefold are given by $h^{1,1}(X) = 1$ and $h^{2,1}(X) = 101$. The Hodge numbers of the degree 3 hypersurface sections are given by $h^{1,1}(Y) = 1$ and $h^{2,1}(Y) = 86$. The difference in the Hodge numbers is $101 - 86 = 15$. Since there are five fixed points of the involution, we have $d(3) = 15/5 = 3$.\n\nFor $d(4)$, we consider degree 4 hypersurface sections. By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the Hodge numbers of the quintic threefold are given by $h^{1,1}(X) = 1$ and $h^{2,1}(X) = 101$. The Hodge numbers of the degree 4 hypersurface sections are given by $h^{1,1}(Y) = 1$ and $h^{2,1}(Y) = 56$. The difference in the Hodge numbers is $101 - 56 = 45$. Since there are five fixed points of the involution, we have $d(4) = 45/5 = 9$.\n\nTherefore, $d(3) = 3$ and $d(4) = 9$."
