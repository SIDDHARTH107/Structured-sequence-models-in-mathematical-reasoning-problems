    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x^2 - 3 and y = -x^2 + 4, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 - 3 = -x^2 + 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x^2 = 7\nx^2 = 7/2\nx = ±√(7/2)\n\nNow that we have the points of intersection, we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. We will integrate the difference between the two functions from -√(7/2) to √(7/2):\n\nArea = ∫[-√(7/2) to √(7/2)] (-x^2 + 4 - (x^2 - 3)) dx\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫[-√(7/2) to √(7/2)] (-2x^2 + 7) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nArea = [-2/3 * x^3 + 7x] evaluated from -√(7/2) to √(7/2)\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nArea = (-2/3 * (√(7/2))^3 + 7 * √(7/2)) - (-2/3 * (-√(7/2))^3 + 7 * -√(7/2))\n\nSimplify:\n\nArea = (-2/3 * (7/2) * √(7/2) + 7 * √(7/2)) - (-2/3 * (-7/2) * √(7/2) + 7 * -√(7/2))\n\nFactor out √(7/2):\n\nArea = √(7/2) * (-2/3 * (7/2) + 7 - 2/3 * (-7/2) - 7)\n\nArea = √(7/2) * (-7 + 14 + 7)\n\nArea = √(7/2) * 14\n\nArea = 14√(7/2)\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x^2 - 3 and y = -x^2 + 4 is 14√(7/2)."
