    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the projection of vector v onto vector u, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection magnitude = (v • u) / ||u||\n\nwhere v • u is the dot product of v and u, and ||u|| is the magnitude of vector u.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of v and u:\n\nv • u = (4 * 5) + (3 * 8) = 20 + 24 = 44\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector u:\n\n||u|| = √(5^2 + 8^2) = √(25 + 64) = √89\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the projection of vector v onto vector u:\n\nprojection magnitude = (v • u) / ||u|| = 44 / √89 ≈ 4.66"
