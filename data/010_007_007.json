    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of X, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, let's consider the torus with a square removed as a union of two open sets A and B, where A is the torus with a small disk removed around the center of the square, and B is an open neighborhood of the removed square.\n\nBoth A and B are path-connected, and their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected. Now, we can compute the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B.\n\n1. The fundamental group of A, denoted π₁(A):\nSince A is a torus with a small disk removed, it is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of two circles, S¹ ∨ S¹. Thus, the fundamental group of A is the free group on two generators, say a and b. So, π₁(A) ≅ ⟨a, b⟩.\n\n2. The fundamental group of B, denoted π₁(B):\nB is an open neighborhood of the removed square, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle S¹. Thus, the fundamental group of B is the free group on one generator, say c. So, π₁(B) ≅ ⟨c⟩.\n\n3. The fundamental group of A ∩ B, denoted π₁(A ∩ B):\nA ∩ B is homotopy equivalent to a circle S¹, so its fundamental group is the free group on one generator, say d. So, π₁(A ∩ B) ≅ ⟨d⟩.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of X, denoted π₁(X), is the free product of π₁(A) and π₁(B) with the amalgamation of π₁(A ∩ B), i.e., π₁(X) ≅ π₁(A) * π₁(B) / N, where N is the normal subgroup generated by the relations between the generators of π₁(A) and π₁(B) induced by the inclusion maps of A ∩ B into A and B.\n\nLet i: A ∩ B → A and j: A ∩ B → B be the inclusion maps. Since A ∩ B is homotopy equivalent to a circle, we have i_*(d) = a^n * b^m and j_*(d) = c^k for some integers n, m, and k.\n\nNow, the normal subgroup N is generated by the relation i_*(d) = j_*(d), i.e., N = ⟨a^n * b^m * c^(-k)⟩. Therefore, the fundamental group of X is given by:\n\nπ₁(X) ≅ ⟨a, b, c | a^n * b^m * c^(-k)⟩.\n\nThis is the fundamental group of the torus with a square removed from its surface. The specific values of n, m, and k depend on the particular choice of the removed square and the identification of the edges of the torus."
