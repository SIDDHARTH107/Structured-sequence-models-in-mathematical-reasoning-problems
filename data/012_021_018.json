    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of a graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph and then determine the size of the largest bag in the decomposition minus one. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the vertex set of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nLet's find a tree decomposition for the given graph G:\n\n1. First, we can create a bag containing vertices {1, 2, 4} since there are edges (1,2), (1,4), and (2,4). We'll call this bag A.\n2. Next, we can create a bag containing vertices {1, 3, 4} since there are edges (1,3) and (3,4). We'll call this bag B.\n3. Now, we can create a bag containing vertices {2, 4, 5} since there is an edge (2,5). We'll call this bag C.\n4. We can create a bag containing vertices {4, 7} since there is an edge (4,7). We'll call this bag D.\n5. Finally, we can create a bag containing vertices {5, 6} since there is an edge (5,6). We'll call this bag E.\n\nNow, we can connect the bags to form a tree decomposition:\n\n- Connect bags A and B since they both contain vertices 1 and 4.\n- Connect bags A and C since they both contain vertices 2 and 4.\n- Connect bags C and E since they both contain vertex 5.\n- Connect bags B and D since they both contain vertex 4.\n\nThe tree decomposition is now complete. The largest bag size is 3 (bags A, B, and C). Therefore, the treewidth of the graph G is 3 - 1 = 2."
