    "message_1": "In a population sample of 1000 individuals, the probability of having a certain medical condition is 0.25. What is the probability that at most 200 individuals have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k individuals with the medical condition\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of individuals (in this case, 1000)\n- k is the number of individuals with the medical condition (in this case, we want to find the probability for at most 200 individuals)\n- p is the probability of having the medical condition (0.25)\n- (1-p) is the probability of not having the medical condition (0.75)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at most 200 individuals having the medical condition, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to k = 200:\n\nP(X ≤ 200) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 200\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean μ = n * p and standard deviation σ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p)) when n is large and p is not too close to 0 or 1.\n\nIn this case, μ = 1000 * 0.25 = 250 and σ = sqrt(1000 * 0.25 * 0.75) ≈ 13.693.\n\nNow we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) to find the probability:\n\nP(X ≤ 200) ≈ P(Z ≤ (200 - μ) / σ) = P(Z ≤ (200 - 250) / 13.693) = P(Z ≤ -3.64)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that P(Z ≤ -3.64) ≈ 0.0001.\n\nSo, the probability that at most 200 individuals have the medical condition is approximately 0.0001 or 0.01%."
