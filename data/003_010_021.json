    "message_1": "A student wants to find the height of a tree. From a distance of 25 meters, the student measures the angle of elevation to the top of the tree as 45 degrees. What is the height of the tree, to the nearest meter, assuming that the ground is flat and level?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the student to the tree is 25 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45Â°) = height / 25\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 25\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 1 * 25\nheight = 25 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree is approximately 25 meters."
