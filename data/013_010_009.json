The demand function is given by P = 50 - Q, where P is the market price and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. The cost function for each firm is C = 5Q, where Q is the quantity produced by the firm. \n\nWhat will be the profit-maximizing quantity of output for each firm, and what will be the resulting market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing quantity of output for each firm, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the best response of a firm to the output level chosen by the other firm.\n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by firm A and firm B, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market, Q, is the sum of the quantities produced by both firms: Q = qA + qB.\n\nThe revenue for each firm is given by the product of the price and the quantity produced by the firm: R = P * Q. Since P = 50 - Q, we can write the revenue functions for both firms as follows:\n\nRA = (50 - Q) * qA = (50 - (qA + qB)) * qA\nRB = (50 - Q) * qB = (50 - (qA + qB)) * qB\n\nThe profit for each firm is the difference between its revenue and cost: π = R - C. Using the cost function C = 5Q, we can write the profit functions for both firms as follows:\n\nπA = RA - 5qA = (50 - (qA + qB)) * qA - 5qA\nπB = RB - 5qB = (50 - (qA + qB)) * qB - 5qB\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit functions with respect to each firm's output level. We do this by taking the first-order partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to qA and qB, and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂πA/∂qA = 50 - 2qA - qB - 5 = 0\n∂πB/∂qB = 50 - 2qB - qA - 5 = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nqA = 15 - 0.5qB\nqB = 15 - 0.5qA\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\nqB = 15 - 0.5(15 - 0.5qB)\nqB = 15 - 7.5 + 0.25qB\n0.75qB = 7.5\nqB = 10\n\nNow, substituting the value of qB back into the first equation, we get:\n\nqA = 15 - 0.5(10)\nqA = 15 - 5\nqA = 10\n\nSo, the profit-maximizing quantity of output for each firm is 10 units. To find the resulting market price, we substitute the values of qA and qB into the demand function:\n\nP = 50 - Q = 50 - (qA + qB) = 50 - (10 + 10) = 50 - 20 = 30\n\nThus, the profit-maximizing quantity of output for each firm is 10 units, and the resulting market price is $30."
