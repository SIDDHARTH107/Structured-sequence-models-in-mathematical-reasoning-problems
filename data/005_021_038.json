    "message_1": "Here's an example numerical problem related to the bootstrap method in statistics:\n\nSuppose a data set containing 20 observations on a variable of interest has a sample mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 10. Using the bootstrap technique with 1,000 resamples, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of the variable of interest.\n\n(Note: The bootstrap method involves repeatedly taking samples from the original data set with replacement and computing a statistic of interest for each resample.)",
    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean using the bootstrap method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample the original data set with replacement 1,000 times, each time taking a sample of size 20 (the same size as the original data set).\n2. Calculate the mean of each resample.\n3. Arrange the means in ascending order.\n4. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the resampled means, which will be the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data set, we can't perform the resampling directly. However, we can use the given sample mean and standard deviation to approximate the confidence interval using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\nAccording to the CLT, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard error (SE) equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 75 and the sample standard deviation is 10. The sample size is 20, so the standard error (SE) is:\n\nSE = 10 / sqrt(20) ≈ 2.24\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) to find the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (which corresponds to the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles).\n\nFinally, we can calculate the margin of error (ME) and the confidence interval:\n\nME = 1.96 * SE ≈ 1.96 * 2.24 ≈ 4.39\n\nLower bound of the 95% confidence interval = Sample mean - ME ≈ 75 - 4.39 ≈ 70.61\nUpper bound of the 95% confidence interval = Sample mean + ME ≈ 75 + 4.39 ≈ 79.39\n\nSo, the estimated 95% confidence interval for the population mean using the bootstrap method is approximately (70.61, 79.39)."
