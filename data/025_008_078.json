Suppose that the Hodge numbers of X satisfy h^{2,1}=2 and h^{1,1}=10. Compute the dimension of the weight 3 part of H^3(X,ℚ).",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the weight 3 part of H^3(X,ℚ), we can use the Hodge decomposition theorem for projective varieties. The Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a projective variety X of dimension n over the complex numbers, the cohomology group H^k(X,ℂ) can be decomposed as a direct sum of Hodge components:\n\nH^k(X,ℂ) = ⊕(p+q=k) H^{p,q}(X)\n\nwhere H^{p,q}(X) is the space of harmonic (p,q)-forms on X. The dimension of H^{p,q}(X) is denoted by h^{p,q}.\n\nIn our case, we have a projective variety X of dimension 3, and we want to compute the dimension of the weight 3 part of H^3(X,ℚ). The weight 3 part corresponds to the Hodge components H^{3,0}(X), H^{2,1}(X), and H^{1,2}(X). By the Hodge symmetry property, we have h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}, so h^{1,2} = h^{2,1}.\n\nWe are given that h^{2,1} = 2 and h^{1,1} = 10. Therefore, h^{1,2} = 2. To compute h^{3,0}, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic χ(X) of a projective variety X of dimension 3 can be expressed in terms of its Hodge numbers as follows:\n\nχ(X) = h^{3,0} - h^{2,1} + h^{1,2} - h^{0,3}\n\nSince X is a projective variety over the complex numbers, it is a Calabi-Yau threefold, which means that its Euler characteristic χ(X) is zero. Thus, we have:\n\n0 = h^{3,0} - 2 + 2 - h^{0,3}\n\nSince h^{3,0} = h^{0,3} by Hodge symmetry, we get h^{3,0} = 1.\n\nNow we can compute the dimension of the weight 3 part of H^3(X,ℚ) as the sum of the dimensions of the Hodge components H^{3,0}(X), H^{2,1}(X), and H^{1,2}(X):\n\ndim(weight 3 part of H^3(X,ℚ)) = h^{3,0} + h^{2,1} + h^{1,2} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo the dimension of the weight 3 part of H^3(X,ℚ) is 5."
