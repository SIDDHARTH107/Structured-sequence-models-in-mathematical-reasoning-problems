    "message_2": "To find the inflection point(s) of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x, we first need to find the second derivative of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x^2 - 18x + 12) = 12x - 18\n\nTo find the inflection point(s), we need to solve f''(x) = 0:\n12x - 18 = 0\n12x = 18\nx = 18/12\nx = 3/2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the inflection point, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging the x-value back into the original function f(x):\nf(3/2) = 2(3/2)^3 - 9(3/2)^2 + 12(3/2)\nf(3/2) = 2(27/8) - 9(9/4) + 18\nf(3/2) = 27/4 - 81/4 + 18\nf(3/2) = (-54/4) + 18\nf(3/2) = -13.5 + 18\nf(3/2) = 4.5\n\nSo, the inflection point is (3/2, 4.5)."
