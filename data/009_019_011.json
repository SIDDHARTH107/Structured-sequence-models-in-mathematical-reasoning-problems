    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the solution to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) and then compute the probability that $X_t \\geq 1$ for $t=4$.\n\nThe given SDE is:\n\n$dX_t = \\sqrt{t} dW_t$\n\nwith $X_0 = 0$ and $W_t$ is a Wiener process.\n\nUsing Ito's formula, we can rewrite the SDE as:\n\n$X_t = X_0 + \\int_0^t \\sqrt{s} dW_s$\n\nSince $X_0 = 0$, we have:\n\n$X_t = \\int_0^t \\sqrt{s} dW_s$\n\nNow, we know that the integral of a deterministic function with respect to a Wiener process is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance equal to the integral of the square of the deterministic function. In this case, the deterministic function is $\\sqrt{s}$, so we have:\n\n$E[X_t] = 0$\n\n$Var[X_t] = \\int_0^t s ds = \\frac{1}{2}t^2$\n\nFor $t=4$, we have:\n\n$E[X_4] = 0$\n\n$Var[X_4] = \\frac{1}{2}(4)^2 = 8$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_4 \\geq 1$. Since $X_4$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 8, we can standardize the variable and use the standard normal distribution to find the probability:\n\n$P(X_4 \\geq 1) = P\\left(\\frac{X_4 - E[X_4]}{\\sqrt{Var[X_4]}} \\geq \\frac{1 - 0}{\\sqrt{8}}\\right) = P\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\right)$\n\nwhere $Z$ is a standard normal random variable.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\n$P(Z \\geq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}) \\approx 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\right) \\approx 1 - 0.7881 \\approx 0.2119$\n\nTherefore, the probability that $X_4 \\geq 1$ is approximately 0.2119."
