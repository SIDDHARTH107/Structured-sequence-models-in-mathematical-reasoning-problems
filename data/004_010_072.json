    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 5, we will integrate each term separately with respect to x.\n\nThe antiderivative of 3x^2 is (3/3)x^(2+1) = x^3.\n\nThe antiderivative of 2x is (2/2)x^(1+1) = x^2.\n\nThe antiderivative of 5 is 5x^(0+1) = 5x.\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 5 is F(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 5x + C, where C is the constant of integration."
