    "message_1": "Consider a torus, which is the surface of a doughnut-shaped object. A straight line, called a geodesic, is drawn on the torus that wraps around the torus once in the longitudinal direction and twice in the latitudinal direction (i.e. it circles the hole twice and the bulge once). The geodesic is then cut and the two ends are tied together to form a closed loop. \n\nWhat is the minimal number of times the loop must be twisted in order to \"untie\" it from the torus and obtain a loop that lies entirely on a plane without intersecting itself?",
    "message_2": "To untie the loop from the torus and obtain a loop that lies entirely on a plane without intersecting itself, we need to consider the number of times the loop wraps around the torus in both the longitudinal and latitudinal directions.\n\nThe loop wraps around the torus once in the longitudinal direction and twice in the latitudinal direction. This can be represented as a pair of integers (1, 2), where the first number corresponds to the longitudinal direction and the second number corresponds to the latitudinal direction.\n\nTo untie the loop, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers. The LCM of 1 and 2 is 2. Therefore, the loop must be twisted a minimum of 2 times to untie it from the torus and obtain a loop that lies entirely on a plane without intersecting itself."
