    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Polya's Enumeration Theorem (also known as the Burnside's Lemma). The theorem helps to count the number of distinct necklaces when rotations are considered the same.\n\nLet's consider the group G of symmetries acting on the set X of necklaces. In this case, the group G consists of 9 rotations (0°, 40°, 80°, ..., 320°). The set X consists of all possible necklaces with 9 beads of different colors.\n\nWe need to find the number of fixed points for each rotation in G. A fixed point is a necklace that remains unchanged after the rotation.\n\n1. For the 0° rotation (identity), all necklaces are fixed points. So, there are 9! fixed points.\n2. For the 40°, 80°, 120°, 160°, 200°, 240°, and 280° rotations, there are no fixed points, as each bead will be in a different position after the rotation.\n3. For the 320° rotation (which is the same as a 40° rotation in the opposite direction), there are also no fixed points for the same reason.\n\nNow, we can apply the Polya's Enumeration Theorem:\n\nNumber of distinct necklaces = (1/|G|) * Σ |X^g|\n\nWhere |G| is the order of the group G (number of elements in G), and |X^g| is the number of fixed points for each element g in G.\n\nNumber of distinct necklaces = (1/9) * (9! + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) = (1/9) * 9! = 8! = 40320\n\nSo, there are 40,320 different necklaces that can be formed with 9 beads of different colors when rotations are considered the same."
