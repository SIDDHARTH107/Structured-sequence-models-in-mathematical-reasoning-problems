    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we can use the augmented matrix and then perform Gaussian elimination to find the solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n```\n| 1  3  1 | 9 |\n| 2 -1  3 | 5 |\n| 3  2 -2 | 0 |\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row to eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\n```\n| 1  3  1 |  9  |\n| 0 -7  1 | -13 |\n| 0 -7 -5 | -27 |\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7:\n\n```\n| 1  3  1 |  9  |\n| 0  1 -1/7 | 13/7 |\n| 0 -7 -5 | -27 |\n```\n\nStep 3: Add 7 times the second row to the third row to eliminate y from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  3   1  |  9   |\n| 0  1 -1/7 | 13/7 |\n| 0  0 -4/7 | -6/7 |\n```\n\nStep 4: Multiply the third row by -7/4 to get a 1 in the z position:\n\n```\n| 1  3   1  |  9   |\n| 0  1 -1/7 | 13/7 |\n| 0  0   1  |  3/2 |\n```\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = 3/2\n\ny = 13/7 + (1/7)(3/2) = 15/7\n\nx = 9 - 3(15/7) - (3/2) = 6/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 6/7, y = 15/7, and z = 3/2."
