    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the gaps between three mutually tangent circles with new circles that are also tangent to the original three. In each iteration, the number of new circles added is 2^n, where n is the iteration number. The sum of the curvatures of the circles in each iteration follows a specific pattern.\n\nLet S(n) be the sum of the curvatures of all circles in the nth iteration of the Apollonian gasket. The initial circle has curvature 1, so S(0) = 1.\n\nFor the first iteration, 2 circles are added, and their curvatures sum to 3. So, S(1) = S(0) + 3 = 4.\n\nFor the second iteration, 4 circles are added, and their curvatures sum to 12. So, S(2) = S(1) + 12 = 16.\n\nFor the third iteration, 8 circles are added, and their curvatures sum to 48. So, S(3) = S(2) + 48 = 64.\n\nFor the fourth iteration, 16 circles are added, and their curvatures sum to 192. So, S(4) = S(3) + 192 = 256.\n\nFor the fifth iteration, 32 circles are added, and their curvatures sum to 768. So, S(5) = S(4) + 768 = 1024.\n\nFor the sixth iteration, 64 circles are added, and their curvatures sum to 3072. So, S(6) = S(5) + 3072 = 4096.\n\nTherefore, the sum of curvatures of all the circles present in the sixth iteration of the Apollonian gasket, given that the initial circle has curvature 1, is 4096."
