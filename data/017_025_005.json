    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the possible group structures using the Sylow theorems.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for a prime p dividing the group order must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo p. Let's find the Sylow subgroups for the prime factors of 120:\n\n- For p = 2: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1, 3, and 15.\n- For p = 3: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are 1 and 10.\n- For p = 5: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is 1.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible group structures:\n\n1. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is cyclic, i.e., isomorphic to Z_120.\n2. If there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_8 and Z_15, denoted as Z_8 ⋊ Z_15.\n3. If there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_4 × Z_4 and Z_15, denoted as (Z_4 × Z_4) ⋊ Z_15.\n4. If there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_5.\n\nIn total, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 120:\n\n1. Z_120 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_8 ⋊ Z_15 (semidirect product of Z_8 and Z_15)\n3. (Z_4 × Z_4) ⋊ Z_15 (semidirect product of Z_4 × Z_4 and Z_15)\n4. S_5 (symmetric group)"
