The total benefit to the group is 5 times the total contribution of all players. If all players contribute equally, how much benefit does each player receive?",
    "message_2": "If all 10 players contribute $10 each, the total contribution is 10 * $10 = $100.\n\nThe total benefit to the group is 5 times the total contribution, so the total benefit is 5 * $100 = $500.\n\nSince the benefit is distributed equally among the 10 players, each player receives a benefit of $500 / 10 = $50."
