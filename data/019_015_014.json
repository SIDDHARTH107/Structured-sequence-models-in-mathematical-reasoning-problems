    "message_2": "In Martin-Löf type theory, we can define an infinite number of distinct types using the base types `void`, `unit`, and `bool`. This is because we can create more complex types using type constructors like product types, sum types, function types, and dependent types.\n\nHowever, if we only consider the base types themselves without any type constructors, there are only 3 distinct types:\n\n1. `void` (The empty type)\n2. `unit` (The unit type)\n3. `bool` (The boolean type)\n\nIf we were to include type constructors, the number of distinct types would be infinite. Here are a few examples of more complex types:\n\n- `unit -> bool` (Function type from `unit` to `bool`)\n- `bool -> bool` (Function type from `bool` to `bool`)\n- `(unit, bool)` (Product type of `unit` and `bool`)\n- `unit + bool` (Sum type of `unit` and `bool`)\n- `Σ(x: bool) bool` (Dependent sum type)\n- `Π(x: bool) bool` (Dependent product type)\n\nAnd so on. The list of distinct types can go on indefinitely as we can keep combining and nesting these type constructors."
