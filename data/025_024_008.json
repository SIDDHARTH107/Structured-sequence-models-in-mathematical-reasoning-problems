    "message_2": "To find the equations for the GIT quotient, we first need to find the invariants of the action of G on ℂ². Let's denote the coordinates of ℂ² by x and y. The action of G on ℂ² is given by:\n\n(x, y) → (ax + by + c, x)\n\nNow, let's consider the coordinate ring of ℂ², which is ℂ[x, y]. We want to find the invariants of this action, i.e., the polynomials in ℂ[x, y] that are fixed by the action of G.\n\nLet f(x, y) be an invariant polynomial. Then, for any g = (a, b, c) ∈ G, we have:\n\nf(ax + by + c, x) = f(x, y)\n\nNow, let's consider the following polynomials:\n\n1. u = x\n2. v = y - x^2\n\nWe claim that these two polynomials are invariant under the action of G. Let's check this:\n\n1. u(ax + by + c, x) = ax + by + c = x + b(y - x^2) = x + bv, so u is invariant.\n2. v(ax + by + c, x) = (y - x^2) - (ax + by + c)^2 = y - x^2 = v, so v is invariant.\n\nNow, let's show that the coordinate ring of the GIT quotient ℂ²/G is generated by these two invariants u and v. We have:\n\nℂ[x, y]^G = ℂ[u, v]\n\nTo see this, note that the action of G on ℂ² is linear, and the invariants u and v are algebraically independent. Therefore, by the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, the coordinate ring of the GIT quotient is generated by these two invariants.\n\nThus, the GIT quotient of the orbit of (1, 0) is given by the coordinate ring ℂ[u, v] = ℂ[x, y - x^2]. The equations for the GIT quotient are:\n\nx = u\ny = x^2 + v\n\nThese equations describe the GIT quotient of the orbit of (1, 0) in the coordinate ring of ℂ²/G."
