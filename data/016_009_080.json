    "message_2": "The length of the Dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Original line segment length) * (2^(n/2))\n\nIn this case, the original line segment has a length of 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 8th iteration. So, n = 8.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(8/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^4)\nLength = 1 * 16\nLength = 16 units\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon curve after the 8th iteration is 16 units."
