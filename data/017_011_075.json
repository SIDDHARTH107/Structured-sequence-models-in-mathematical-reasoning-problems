    "message_2": "To prove this, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet the number of 2-Sylow subgroups be n_2 and the number of 3-Sylow subgroups be n_3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that n_2 divides 6 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2), and n_3 divides 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, the possible values for n_2 are 1 or 3, and the possible value for n_3 is 1.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is a cyclic group of order 12. Thus, G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4, and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups. Then, |P_2| = 4, so P_2 is either isomorphic to C4 (cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (Klein-4 group).\n\nSubcase 2.1: P_2 is isomorphic to C4\nLet a be a generator of P_2 and b be a generator of P_3. Then, G is generated by a and b, and |a| = 4, |b| = 3. Since P_3 is normal in G, we have that bab^(-1) is in P_3 for all a in P_2. Since |P_3| = 3, either bab^(-1) = b or bab^(-1) = b^2. In either case, we can define a homomorphism φ: G → S3 by φ(a) = (1 2) and φ(b) = (1 2 3). It is easy to check that φ is indeed a homomorphism, and since φ is surjective, G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S3 of order 12. Thus, G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nSubcase 2.2: P_2 is isomorphic to V4\nLet a, b, and c be generators of P_2 such that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e and ab = c. Let d be a generator of P_3. Then, G is generated by a, b, and d, and |a| = |b| = 2, |d| = 3. Since P_3 is normal in G, we have that dad^(-1) is in P_3 for all a in P_2. Since |P_3| = 3, either dad^(-1) = d or dad^(-1) = d^2. In either case, we can define a homomorphism φ: G → S6 by φ(a) = (1 2), φ(b) = (3 4), and φ(d) = (1 3 5). It is easy to check that φ is indeed a homomorphism, and since φ is surjective, G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S6 of order 12. Thus, G is isomorphic to D6.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 12, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
