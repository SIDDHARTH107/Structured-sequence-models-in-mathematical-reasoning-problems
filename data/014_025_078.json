    "message_2": "To compute the SHA-256 hash value of a 256-bit message, we need to follow the SHA-256 algorithm. However, since the message itself is not provided, I cannot compute the exact hash value. \n\nIf you provide the message, I can help you compute the SHA-256 hash value. Alternatively, you can use an online SHA-256 hash generator or a programming language library to compute the hash value of your message."
