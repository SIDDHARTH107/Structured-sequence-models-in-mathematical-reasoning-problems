    "message_2": "In a modal logic system with three propositions and two possible values (true/false) for each proposition, we can calculate the number of possible worlds using the formula:\n\nNumber of possible worlds = (number of possible values)^(number of propositions)\n\nIn this case, there are two possible values (true/false) and three propositions. So the calculation would be:\n\nNumber of possible worlds = 2^3 = 8\n\nThere are 8 possible worlds in this modal logic system."
