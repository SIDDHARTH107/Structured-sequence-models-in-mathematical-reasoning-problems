    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we need to find the angle opposite the shortest side, which is 10 cm. We will use the Law of Cosines to find this angle.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides, respectively:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = 12 cm, b = 15 cm, and c = 10 cm. We want to find angle C.\n\n10² = 12² + 15² - 2 * 12 * 15 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 144 + 225 - 360 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 369 - 360 * cos(C)\n\n-269 = -360 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 269/360\n\nNow, we find the inverse cosine (arccos) to get the angle C:\n\nC = arccos(269/360)\n\nC ≈ 42.3°\n\nSo, the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 42.3°."
