    "message_2": "The Schwarz reflection $S(z) = \\overline{z}$ is a reflection with respect to the real axis. This means that it takes a complex number $z = a + bi$ and maps it to its complex conjugate $\\overline{z} = a - bi$. \n\nNow, let's consider the unit disc $D = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: |z| < 1\\}$. The unit disc consists of all complex numbers with a magnitude less than 1. \n\nTo find the image of the unit disc under the Schwarz reflection, we need to apply the reflection to each point in the disc. Let $z = a + bi \\in D$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $|z| < 1$. Then, the Schwarz reflection of $z$ is $\\overline{z} = a - bi$. \n\nSince $|z| < 1$, we have $a^2 + b^2 < 1$. Now, let's consider the magnitude of $\\overline{z}$:\n\n$|\\overline{z}|^2 = (a - bi)(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2 < 1$.\n\nThus, $|\\overline{z}| < 1$, which means that $\\overline{z}$ is also in the unit disc $D$. \n\nIn conclusion, the image of the unit disc $D$ under the Schwarz reflection $S(z) = \\overline{z}$ with respect to the real axis is the unit disc itself, $D$."
