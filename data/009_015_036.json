    "message_1": "Suppose a radioactive substance initially contains 500 grams of material that decays with a half-life of 15 years. How much of the substance will remain after 30 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 500 grams, the time elapsed is 30 years, and the half-life is 15 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^(30 / 15)\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^2\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/4)\nFinal amount = 125 grams\n\nSo, after 30 years, 125 grams of the radioactive substance will remain."
