    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of equations as follows:\n\n(1) 3x + 2yi - z = 5 + i\n(2) 2x - y + 4zi = 1\n(3) x + 3yi + 2z = 3 - 2i\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, multiply equation (3) by 2 and subtract equation (2) from the result:\n\n(4) 2(x + 3yi + 2z) - (2x - y + 4zi) = 2(3 - 2i) - 1\n(4) 6yi + 4z - y - 4zi = 6 - 4i - 1\n(4) (6yi - 4zi) + 4z - y = 5 - 4i\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from equations (1) and (3). To do this, multiply equation (3) by 3 and subtract equation (1) from the result:\n\n(5) 3(x + 3yi + 2z) - (3x + 2yi - z) = 3(3 - 2i) - (5 + i)\n(5) 9yi + 6z - 2yi + z = 9 - 6i - 5 - i\n(5) (9yi - 2yi) + 7z = 4 - 7i\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (y and z):\n\n(4) (6yi - 4zi) + 4z - y = 5 - 4i\n(5) (9yi - 2yi) + 7z = 4 - 7i\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n(4) 6yi - 4zi + 4z - y = 5 - 4i\n(5) 7yi + 7z = 4 - 7i\n\nNow, let's solve equation (5) for y:\n\ny = (4 - 7i - 7z) / 7i\n\nSubstitute this expression for y in equation (4):\n\n6yi - 4zi + 4z - (4 - 7i - 7z) / 7i = 5 - 4i\n\nMultiply both sides by 7i:\n\n42i^2 - 28zi^2 + 28zi - 4 + 7i + 7zi = 35i - 28i^2\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can simplify the equation:\n\n-42 + 28z - 28z - 4 + 7i + 7z = 35i + 28\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-46 + 7z + 7i = 35i + 28\n\nNow, equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n7z = 28 => z = 4\n7i = 35i => i = 5\n\nNow that we have z, we can find y using the expression we found earlier:\n\ny = (4 - 7i - 7z) / 7i\ny = (4 - 7(5) - 7(4)) / 7(5)\ny = (-3 - 4) / 5\ny = -7/5\n\nNow that we have y and z, we can find x using equation (3):\n\nx + 3yi + 2z = 3 - 2i\nx + 3(-7/5)i + 2(4) = 3 - 2i\nx - 21i/5 + 8 = 3 - 2i\n\nEquate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nx + 8 = 3 => x = -5\n-21i/5 = -2i => i = 21/10\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = -5\ny = -7/5\nz = 4"
