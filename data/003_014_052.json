    "message_2": "To find the period, amplitude, and phase shift of the given function y = 3sin(2x - π/3), we need to analyze the function and compare it to the general form of a sine function, which is y = A sin(Bx - C).\n\nIn our case, the function is y = 3sin(2x - π/3), so we can identify the following:\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 3, so the amplitude is 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π) / |B|. In this case, B = 2, so the period is (2π) / 2 = π.\n\nPhase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value of C / B, which determines the horizontal shift of the function. In this case, C = π/3 and B = 2, so the phase shift is (π/3) / 2 = π/6. Since the function is in the form y = A sin(Bx - C), the phase shift is positive, meaning the function is shifted π/6 units to the right.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 3, the period is π, and the phase shift is π/6 (to the right) in radians."
