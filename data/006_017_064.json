    "message_1": "On a road, the probability of an accident caused by driver's negligence is 0.2 and the probability of an accident caused by bad weather conditions is 0.3. If the probability of an accident occurring due to both reasons is 0.1, what is the probability of an accident occurring on the road either due to driver's negligence or bad weather condition?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of an accident occurring on the road either due to driver's negligence or bad weather condition, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A represents the event of an accident caused by driver's negligence, B represents the event of an accident caused by bad weather conditions, and A ∩ B represents the event of an accident caused by both reasons.\n\nWe are given:\n\nP(A) = 0.2\nP(B) = 0.3\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.1\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.2 + 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.4\n\nSo, the probability of an accident occurring on the road either due to driver's negligence or bad weather condition is 0.4 or 40%."
