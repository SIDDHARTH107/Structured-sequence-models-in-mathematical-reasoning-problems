    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of product A requires 2 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor, while the production of product B requires 1 hour of machine time and 4 hours of labor. The company has a total of 10,000 hours of machine time and 18,000 hours of labor available for the production. The profit from the sale of one unit of product A is $150 and the profit from the sale of one unit of product B is $100. Determine the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
