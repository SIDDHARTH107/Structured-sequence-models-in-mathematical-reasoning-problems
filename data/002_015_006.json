    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven that the diameter (d) is 10 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(10)\nC ≈ 3.14159 × 10\nC ≈ 31.4159 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 31.4159 cm."
