If f: A U B --> [0,1] is continuous and f(x) = 0 for all x∈ A and f(y) = 1 for all y∈ B, does there exist a continuous function g : X --> [0,1] such that g(x) = f(x) for all x∈ A U B?

    "message_2": "Yes, there exists a continuous function g : X --> [0,1] such that g(x) = f(x) for all x∈ A U B, under the condition that A and B are both closed in X.\n\nProof:\n\nSince f is continuous on A U B, and f(x) = 0 for all x∈ A and f(y) = 1 for all y∈ B, we have that f^(-1)(0) = A and f^(-1)(1) = B. Since f is continuous, the preimages of closed sets are closed. Since {0} and {1} are closed subsets of [0,1], it follows that A and B are closed in X.\n\nNow, define the function g : X --> [0,1] as follows:\n\ng(x) = f(x) for all x∈ A U B\ng(x) = 0 for all x∈ A\ng(x) = 1 for all x∈ B\n\nWe need to show that g is continuous on X. Let C be a closed subset of [0,1]. We want to show that g^(-1)(C) is closed in X.\n\nCase 1: 0, 1 ∉ C\n\nIn this case, g^(-1)(C) = f^(-1)(C) ∩ (A U B), which is closed in A U B since f is continuous. Since A U B is closed in X, g^(-1)(C) is also closed in X.\n\nCase 2: 0 ∈ C, 1 ∉ C\n\nIn this case, g^(-1)(C) = (f^(-1)(C) ∩ (A U B)) U A. Since f is continuous, f^(-1)(C) ∩ (A U B) is closed in A U B, and A is closed in X. Therefore, g^(-1)(C) is closed in X.\n\nCase 3: 0 ∉ C, 1 ∈ C\n\nSimilar to Case 2, g^(-1)(C) = (f^(-1)(C) ∩ (A U B)) U B, which is closed in X.\n\nCase 4: 0, 1 ∈ C\n\nIn this case, g^(-1)(C) = (f^(-1)(C) ∩ (A U B)) U A U B = X, which is closed in X.\n\nIn all cases, the preimage of a closed set under g is closed in X, so g is continuous on X. Thus, there exists a continuous function g : X --> [0,1] such that g(x) = f(x) for all x∈ A U B, provided that A and B are both closed in X."
