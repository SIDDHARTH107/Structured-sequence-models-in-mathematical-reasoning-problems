    "message_1": "Assuming that we have a Feistel cipher structure with a block size of 64 bits and 16 rounds, and we want to encrypt a plaintext block of 64 bits using a Feistel cipher with a random key, how many unique keys are possible for this encryption?",
    "message_2": "The number of unique keys possible for a Feistel cipher depends on the key size used in the cipher. The block size and the number of rounds do not directly affect the number of unique keys. \n\nLet's assume the key size is k bits. Then, the number of unique keys possible for this encryption would be 2^k. \n\nTo provide a more specific answer, we would need to know the key size used in the Feistel cipher."
