    "message_1": "Let X be a topological space such that X has exactly 5 connected components. Find the minimum number of paths needed to connect any two points in X.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the connected components as A, B, C, D, and E. To connect any two points in X, we need to connect each connected component to at least one other connected component. We can do this by connecting the components in the following way:\n\n1. Connect a point in A to a point in B.\n2. Connect a point in B to a point in C.\n3. Connect a point in C to a point in D.\n4. Connect a point in D to a point in E.\n\nWith these 4 paths, any two points in X can be connected through a sequence of paths. For example, to connect a point in A to a point in E, we can go from A to B, B to C, C to D, and finally D to E.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of paths needed to connect any two points in X is 4."
