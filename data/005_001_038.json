    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nA manufacturer claims that the average lifespan of their light bulbs is 800 hours. You decide to test this claim by collecting a sample of 50 light bulbs and measuring their lifespan. You find that the average lifespan of your sample is 820 hours with a standard deviation of 30 hours. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level to determine whether the manufacturer's claim is accurate.\n\nWhat is the null hypothesis for this test? What is the alternative hypothesis? Calculate the test statistic and the p-value. Based on the results, can you reject the null hypothesis? What conclusion can you draw about the manufacturer's claim?",
    "message_2": "The null hypothesis (H0) for this test is that the average lifespan of the light bulbs is equal to the manufacturer's claim, which is 800 hours. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average lifespan is not equal to 800 hours.\n\nH0: μ = 800\nH1: μ ≠ 800\n\nTo calculate the test statistic, we will use the formula for a t-test:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √sample size)\n\nt = (820 - 800) / (30 / √50)\n\nt ≈ 4.71\n\nNow, we need to find the p-value. Since this is a two-tailed test, we will look for the probability of getting a t-value greater than 4.71 or less than -4.71 in a t-distribution with 49 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1). Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the p-value is very close to 0.\n\nSince the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is strong evidence to suggest that the average lifespan of the light bulbs is not equal to the manufacturer's claim of 800 hours. Based on the sample data, it appears that the average lifespan of the light bulbs is actually greater than the manufacturer's claim."
