    "message_2": "To solve the equation |5 - 2x| = 11, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5 - 2x >= 0\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n5 - 2x = 11\n-2x = 6\nx = -3\n\nCase 2: 5 - 2x < 0\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n-(5 - 2x) = 11\n-5 + 2x = 11\n2x = 16\nx = 8\n\nSo, the solutions for x are -3 and 8."
