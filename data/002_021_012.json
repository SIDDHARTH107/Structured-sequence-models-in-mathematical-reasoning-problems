    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 8 cm. Find the area of the sector that has an angle of 45 degrees.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (angle/360) × π × radius²\n\nIn this case, the angle is 45 degrees and the radius is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (45/360) × π × 8²\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × π × 64\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × 64π\n\nArea of sector = 8π cm²\n\nSo, the area of the sector with an angle of 45 degrees and a radius of 8 cm is 8π cm²."
