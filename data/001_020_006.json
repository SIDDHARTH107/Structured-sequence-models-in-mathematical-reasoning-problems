    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x-5| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 5 = 7\nIn this case, we can solve for x as follows:\n2x = 7 + 5\n2x = 12\nx = 6\n\nCase 2: 2x - 5 = -7\nIn this case, we can solve for x as follows:\n2x = -7 + 5\n2x = -2\nx = -1\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the equation |2x-5| = 7 are x = 6 and x = -1."
