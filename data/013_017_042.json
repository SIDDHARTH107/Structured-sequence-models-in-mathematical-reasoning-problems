    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Game Theory and Adverse Selection:\n\nSuppose there are two types of used cars: high-quality cars and low-quality cars. The market value of a high-quality car is $8,000, while the market value of a low-quality car is $3,000. A seller has a high-quality car with a probability of 1/4 and a low-quality car with a probability of 3/4. The seller knows the quality of the car, but the buyer does not. The buyer's valuation of a high-quality car is $10,000, while their valuation of a low-quality car is $2,000. The seller intends to sell the car at a fixed price.\n\na) What is the expected value of the seller's car?\nb) Suppose the seller sets the price at $7,000. What type of car does the buyer expect to receive, and what is their expected utility?\nc) What price should the seller set to maximize their expected utility?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the expected value of the seller's car, we need to multiply the probability of each type of car by its market value and then sum the results:\n\nExpected value = (1/4 * $8,000) + (3/4 * $3,000)\nExpected value = ($2,000) + ($2,250)\nExpected value = $4,250\n\nb) If the seller sets the price at $7,000, the buyer will expect to receive a high-quality car, since the price is closer to the market value of a high-quality car ($8,000) than a low-quality car ($3,000). To calculate the buyer's expected utility, we need to multiply the probability of each type of car by the buyer's valuation and then subtract the price:\n\nExpected utility = (1/4 * $10,000) + (3/4 * $2,000) - $7,000\nExpected utility = ($2,500) + ($1,500) - $7,000\nExpected utility = -$3,000\n\nSince the expected utility is negative, the buyer would not purchase the car at this price.\n\nc) To maximize the seller's expected utility, they should set the price equal to the expected value of the car, which is $4,250. This way, the buyer's expected utility would be zero, and they would be indifferent between buying and not buying the car. The seller would maximize their expected utility by selling the car at a price that reflects its true expected value."
