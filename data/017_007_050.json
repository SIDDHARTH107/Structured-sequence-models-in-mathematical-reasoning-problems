    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 6, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 6 must have a subgroup of order 2 and a subgroup of order 3, by Lagrange's theorem.\n2. If a group has a normal subgroup of order 3 and a normal subgroup of order 2, then the group is a direct product of these subgroups.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 6. By fact 1, G has a subgroup H of order 3 and a subgroup K of order 2. Since the index of H in G is 2, H is a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, since the order of K is 2, K is also a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: G is a cyclic group of order 6.\nIn this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6, which is generated by an element of order 6. This group has a unique subgroup of order 3 and a unique subgroup of order 2.\n\nCase 2: G is not a cyclic group.\nIn this case, G cannot have an element of order 6. Since G has a normal subgroup H of order 3 and a normal subgroup K of order 2, by fact 2, G is isomorphic to the direct product H x K. The direct product of a group of order 3 and a group of order 2 is the dihedral group D3, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.\n\nTherefore, there are only two distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 6: the cyclic group C6 and the dihedral group D3. Every group of order 6 is isomorphic to either C6 or D3."
