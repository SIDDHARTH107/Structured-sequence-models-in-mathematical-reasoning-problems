If the initial displacement is given as u(x,0) = sin(πx/L) and the initial velocity is zero, find the displacement of the string u(x,t) at time t = 0.5 secs, if the length of the string is L = 1m and the wave propagates with a speed of 2 m/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we'll substitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n∂²u/∂t² = 4 * ∂²u/∂x²\nX(x) * T''(t) = 4 * X''(x) * T(t)\n\nNext, we'll separate the variables by dividing both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT''(t) / T(t) = 4 * X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -λ²:\n\nT''(t) / T(t) = 4 * X''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) = -λ²/4 * X(x)\nT''(t) = -λ² * T(t)\n\nWe'll solve the equation for X(x) first. Since the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions X(0) = X(L) = 0. The general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A * sin(κx) + B * cos(κx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = B = 0\nX(L) = A * sin(κL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(κL) = 0. This implies that κL = nπ for some integer n. Thus, κ = nπ/L and λ² = 4 * (nπ/L)². The solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A * sin(nπx/L)\n\nNow, we'll solve the equation for T(t). The general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C * cos(λt) + D * sin(λt)\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, we have ∂u/∂t(x,0) = 0. Differentiating u(x,t) with respect to t and applying the initial condition, we get:\n\nX(x) * T'(0) = 0\n\nSince X(x) cannot be zero, we must have T'(0) = 0. This implies that D = 0. Thus, the solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C * cos(λt)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for u(x,t):\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[C_n * sin(nπx/L) * cos(nπct/L)]\n\nwhere c = 2 m/s is the wave speed, and the sum is over all integers n. To find the coefficients C_n, we'll use the initial displacement condition u(x,0) = sin(πx/L):\n\nsin(πx/L) = ∑[C_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nComparing the two sides, we see that C_1 = 1 and all other C_n = 0. Therefore, the solution for u(x,t) is:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(πx/L) * cos(πct/L)\n\nFinally, we'll find the displacement of the string at time t = 0.5 secs:\n\nu(x,0.5) = sin(πx) * cos(π * 2 * 0.5) = sin(πx) * cos(π) = -sin(πx)\n\nSo, the displacement of the string at time t = 0.5 secs is u(x,0.5) = -sin(πx)."
