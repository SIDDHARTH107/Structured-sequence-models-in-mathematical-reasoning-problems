However, this does not show that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection, as we have not considered any other sets or operations.\n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection, we need to find an example where (A × B) ∩ C ≠ A × (B ∩ C) for some sets A, B, and C.\n\nLet A = {1}, B = {2}, and C = {(1, 2)}. Then,\n\nA × B = {(1, 2)}\nB ∩ C = ∅\nA × (B ∩ C) = A × ∅ = ∅\n\nHowever,\n\n(A × B) ∩ C = {(1, 2)} ∩ {(1, 2)} = {(1, 2)}\n\nSince (A × B) ∩ C ≠ A × (B ∩ C), the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection."
