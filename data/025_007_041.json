    "message_2": "To find the degree of L, we will use the Riemann-Roch Theorem. The Riemann-Roch Theorem for a line bundle L on a smooth projective curve X over a field k states that:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere h^0(X, L) is the dimension of the space of global sections of L, h^1(X, L) is the dimension of the first cohomology group of L, deg(L) is the degree of L, and g is the genus of the curve X.\n\nIn our case, we are given that H^1(X, L) = 0, so h^1(X, L) = 0. We are also given that there exists a global section of L with exactly m zeroes on X. By the Divisor Theorem, the degree of the divisor associated with this global section is m. Since the degree of a line bundle is the degree of its associated divisor, we have deg(L) = m.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Riemann-Roch Theorem:\n\nh^0(X, L) - 0 = m + 1 - g.\n\nSince there exists a global section of L, we know that h^0(X, L) ≥ 1. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1 ≤ m + 1 - g.\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\nm ≥ g - 1.\n\nThus, the degree of L is m, which is greater than or equal to g - 1, where g is the genus of the curve X."
