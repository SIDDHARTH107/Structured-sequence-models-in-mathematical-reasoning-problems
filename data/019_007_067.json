    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem on non-monotonic logic for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose that John believes that all birds can fly. However, John sees an emu for the first time, and the emu cannot fly. John then modifies his belief to say that most birds can fly, but not all. If John sees a penguin next, which cannot fly, what will he believe about the flying abilities of birds?",
    "message_2": "After seeing the penguin, which also cannot fly, John's belief about the flying abilities of birds will likely be further modified. He may now believe that while many birds can fly, there are also several types of birds that cannot fly. His belief system will continue to adapt as he encounters more examples of birds with varying flying abilities."
