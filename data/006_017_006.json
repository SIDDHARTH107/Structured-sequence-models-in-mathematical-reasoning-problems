    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 accidents on a given day, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (accidents), k is the number of events we want to find the probability for, λ (lambda) is the average number of events (accidents) per interval (day), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, λ = 4 accidents per day. We want to find the probability of at least 2 accidents, which means we need to find the probability of 2, 3, 4, ... accidents and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of 0 or 1 accident and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(at least 2 accidents) = 1 - P(0 accidents) - P(1 accident)\n\nLet's calculate P(0 accidents) and P(1 accident):\n\nP(0 accidents) = (e^(-4) * 4^0) / 0! = (e^(-4) * 1) / 1 = e^(-4)\n\nP(1 accident) = (e^(-4) * 4^1) / 1! = (e^(-4) * 4) / 1 = 4 * e^(-4)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 accidents:\n\nP(at least 2 accidents) = 1 - e^(-4) - 4 * e^(-4) ≈ 1 - 0.0183 - 0.0732 ≈ 0.9085\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 2 accidents on a given day is approximately 0.9085 or 90.85%."
