    "message_1": "Suppose you have a box containing 10 red balls and 5 blue balls. You randomly select a ball from the box, write down its color, and return it to the box. You repeat this process 6 times. What is the probability that exactly 3 red balls and 3 blue balls are chosen? To solve this problem, apply linear logic concepts of conjunction, disjunction and implication.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula. Since we are drawing with replacement, the probability of each event remains constant throughout the process. \n\nLet R represent the event of drawing a red ball, and B represent the event of drawing a blue ball. We want to find the probability of the event (RRRBBB), but since the order of drawing the balls does not matter, we need to consider all possible arrangements of drawing 3 red balls and 3 blue balls.\n\nThere are 6!/(3!3!) = 20 different ways to arrange 3 red balls and 3 blue balls. \n\nNow, we calculate the probability of drawing a red ball and a blue ball:\nP(R) = 10/15 = 2/3\nP(B) = 5/15 = 1/3\n\nSince we are drawing with replacement, the probability of each event is independent. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 red balls and 3 blue balls in any order is:\nP(RRRBBB) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^3 = 8/729\n\nFinally, we multiply this probability by the number of possible arrangements to find the overall probability of drawing exactly 3 red balls and 3 blue balls:\nP(3 red balls and 3 blue balls) = 20 * (8/729) = 160/729 â‰ˆ 0.2196\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly 3 red balls and 3 blue balls is approximately 0.2196 or 21.96%."
