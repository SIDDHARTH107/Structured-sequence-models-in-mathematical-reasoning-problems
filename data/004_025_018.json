    "message_1": "A car is traveling at a constant velocity of 30 m/s. If the driver slams on the brakes and brings the car to a stop in 5 seconds, what is the magnitude of the force of friction acting on the car? The mass of the car is 1500 kg. (Assume a constant force of friction.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the force of friction acting on the car, we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n\nFirst, we need to find the acceleration of the car. Since the car comes to a stop, its final velocity (v_f) is 0 m/s. We know the initial velocity (v_i) is 30 m/s, and the time (t) it takes to stop is 5 seconds. We can use the following equation to find the acceleration:\n\nv_f = v_i + at\n\n0 = 30 + a(5)\n\n-30 = 5a\n\na = -6 m/s²\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the initial velocity, which makes sense since the car is slowing down.\n\nNow that we have the acceleration, we can use Newton's second law to find the force of friction:\n\nF = ma\n\nF = (1500 kg)(-6 m/s²)\n\nF = -9000 N\n\nThe magnitude of the force of friction is 9000 N. The negative sign indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction of the initial velocity, which is expected for a braking force."
