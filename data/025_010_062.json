    "message_2": "We will first use the Riemann-Roch theorem to determine the dimension of the linear space $\\ell(D)$ of functions on $C$ with poles of order at most $m$ along $D$. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g$,\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$,\n\nwhere $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$ and $l(D)$ denotes the dimension of the linear space $\\ell(D)$.\n\nIn our case, the degree of the divisor $D$ is $r$. Since $C$ is a non-singular plane curve of degree $d$, its genus $g$ is given by the formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the elliptic curve $C$ given by $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is a non-zero constant. The genus of an elliptic curve is 1, so in this case, $g = 1$. The divisor $D$ is given by $D = P_1 + P_2$, where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are points on $C$. Since $m = 2$, the degree of the divisor $D$ is $r = 2$.\n\nApplying the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2$.\n\nSince $C$ is an elliptic curve, the canonical divisor $K_C$ is trivial, i.e., $K_C \\sim 0$. Therefore, $l(K_C - D) = l(-D)$. Now, we know that for an elliptic curve, $l(-D) = 0$ if $\\deg(-D) < 0$ and $l(-D) = 1$ if $\\deg(-D) = 0$. In our case, $\\deg(-D) = -2 < 0$, so $l(-D) = 0$.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$l(D) = 2$.\n\nSo, the dimension of the linear space $\\ell(D)$ of functions on the elliptic curve $C$ with poles of order at most 2 along $D$ is 2."
