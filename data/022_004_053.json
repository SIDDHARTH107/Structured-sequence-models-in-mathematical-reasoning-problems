    "message_2": "To determine the order of the singularity of $f(z)$ at $z=1$, we can look at the exponent of the factor $(z-1)$ in the denominator. In this case, the exponent is 2. Therefore, the order of the singularity at $z=1$ is 2.\n\nNow, we need to classify the singularity as removable, pole, or essential. A singularity is removable if the function can be redefined at the singular point to make it analytic. A singularity is a pole if the function approaches infinity as $z$ approaches the singular point. A singularity is essential if it is neither removable nor a pole.\n\nIn this case, the singularity at $z=1$ is a pole because the function approaches infinity as $z$ approaches 1 due to the factor $(z-1)^2$ in the denominator. Since the order of the singularity is 2, we can say that $f(z)$ has a pole of order 2 at $z=1$."
