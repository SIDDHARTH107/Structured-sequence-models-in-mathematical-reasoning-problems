    "message_1": "Consider the reaction-diffusion equation for the concentration profile of a chemical species in one dimension given by:\n\n∂C/∂t = D ∂²C/∂x² + kC - λC²,\n\nwhere C(x, t) is the concentration of the chemical species at position x and time t, D is the diffusion coefficient, k is the reaction rate constant, and λ is the nonlinear coefficient.\n\nSuppose we have a homogeneous medium with D = 0.05 cm²/s, k = 0.1 s⁻¹, and λ = 0.001 cm²/s. Initially, the concentration profile is given by C(x, 0) = 0.1 for -5 cm ≤ x ≤ 5 cm and C(x, 0) = 0 elsewhere.\n\nDetermine the steady-state concentration profile and the time required to reach steady state. Find the concentration profile and plot it as a function of x for t = 1000 s.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state concentration profile, we set ∂C/∂t = 0, which gives:\n\n0 = D ∂²C/∂x² + kC - λC².\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n∂²C/∂x² = (λC² - kC) / D.\n\nThis is a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that does not have a general analytical solution. However, we can solve it numerically using a suitable method, such as the finite difference method or a numerical ODE solver.\n\nTo find the time required to reach steady state, we need to monitor the change in the concentration profile over time. We can do this by solving the original reaction-diffusion equation numerically and checking when the change in the concentration profile becomes negligible. This can be done using a suitable stopping criterion, such as when the maximum change in concentration between consecutive time steps is less than a specified tolerance.\n\nFor the given problem, we can use the initial condition C(x, 0) = 0.1 for -5 cm ≤ x ≤ 5 cm and C(x, 0) = 0 elsewhere. We can then solve the reaction-diffusion equation numerically for t = 1000 s and plot the concentration profile as a function of x.\n\nTo do this, we can use a numerical software package, such as MATLAB or Python, to implement the finite difference method or a numerical ODE solver. The resulting plot will show the concentration profile of the chemical species at t = 1000 s as a function of x."
