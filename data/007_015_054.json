    "message_2": "A Mersenne number is a number in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. To find the smallest Mersenne number greater than 10,000, we need to find the smallest n such that 2^n - 1 > 10,000.\n\nLet's try some values of n:\n\nn = 14: 2^14 - 1 = 16,383\nn = 13: 2^13 - 1 = 8,191\n\nAs we can see, when n = 14, the Mersenne number is greater than 10,000. So, the smallest Mersenne number greater than 10,000 is 16,383."
