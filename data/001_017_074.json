    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log base 2 (x+3) - log base 2 (x-1) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog base 2 ((x+3)/(x-1)) = 3\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log base b (a) = c, then a = b^c. Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\n(x+3)/(x-1) = 2^3\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n(x+3)/(x-1) = 8\n\nNow, to solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (x-1):\n\n(x+3) = 8(x-1)\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation:\n\nx + 3 = 8x - 8\n\nSubtracting x from both sides:\n\n3 = 7x - 8\n\nAdding 8 to both sides:\n\n11 = 7x\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\nx = 11/7 ≈ 1.6\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth, the solution to the logarithmic equation is x ≈ 1.6."
