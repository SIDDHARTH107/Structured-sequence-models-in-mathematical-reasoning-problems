    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question:\n\nSuppose a company, Alpha Inc., hires a manager to run its operations. The manager's effort level directly affects the company's profits, which are given by the following function:\n\nProfit = 10E - E^2\n\nwhere E represents the manager's effort level (in units of hours).\n\nThe manager's effort level is unobservable, so the company offers the manager a contract that specifies a wage of $20 per hour, regardless of effort level. The manager can either accept or reject the contract.\n\nIf the manager accepts, their utility (in dollars) is given by:\n\nUtility = Wage - .5(E - 8)^2\n\nwhere Wage = $20 and E is the effort level.\n\nIf the manager rejects, they can work for another company and earn an expected wage of $30 per hour.\n\nAssuming that the company wants to maximize its profits, what level of effort should the manager exert?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal level of effort, we need to maximize the manager's utility, given that they will accept the contract from Alpha Inc. and work for $20 per hour. We will do this by taking the first derivative of the utility function with respect to the effort level (E) and setting it equal to zero.\n\nUtility = Wage - 0.5(E - 8)^2\nUtility = 20 - 0.5(E - 8)^2\n\nNow, we will take the first derivative of the utility function with respect to E:\n\nd(utility)/dE = -0.5 * 2 * (E - 8) * 1 = -(E - 8)\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n0 = -(E - 8)\n\nSolving for E:\n\nE = 8\n\nSo, the manager should exert an effort level of 8 hours to maximize their utility under the contract offered by Alpha Inc.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the manager will accept the contract or not. We will do this by comparing the utility of accepting the contract with the utility of working for another company at $30 per hour.\n\nUtility (accepting contract) = 20 - 0.5(8 - 8)^2 = 20\nUtility (rejecting contract) = 30\n\nSince the utility of rejecting the contract (30) is greater than the utility of accepting the contract (20), the manager will choose to work for another company. Therefore, the company will not be able to maximize its profits with the current contract offer."
