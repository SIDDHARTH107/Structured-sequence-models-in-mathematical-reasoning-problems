    "message_2": "The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a non-singular curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nwhere h^0(X, L) is the dimension of the space of global sections of L, h^1(X, L) is the dimension of the space of global sections of the dual line bundle L^*, and deg(L) is the degree of L.\n\nIn this case, we have g = 3 and deg(L) = 5. We want to find h^0(X, L). To do this, we need to find h^1(X, L). We can use the Serre duality theorem, which states that:\n\nh^1(X, L) = h^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^*)\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical bundle on X. The canonical bundle has degree 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4. Since deg(L) = 5, we have deg(L^*) = -5. Therefore, deg(K_X ⊗ L^*) = deg(K_X) + deg(L^*) = 4 - 5 = -1.\n\nSince the degree of K_X ⊗ L^* is negative, there are no global sections, so h^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^*) = 0. By Serre duality, we have h^1(X, L) = 0.\n\nNow we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\nh^0(X, L) - 0 = 5 + 1 - 3\nh^0(X, L) = 3\n\nSo the dimension of the space H^0(X, L) is 3."
