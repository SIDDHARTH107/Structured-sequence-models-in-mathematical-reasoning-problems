    "message_1": "A math student wants to find the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry. Let's consider two vectors u = <2, 5, -3> and v = <7, -1, 4>. \n\nWhat is the magnitude of the cross product of u and v?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors u and v, we first need to find the cross product itself, and then find its magnitude.\n\nThe cross product of u and v, denoted as u x v, is given by:\n\nu x v = <(5 * 4 - (-3) * (-1)), (-3) * 7 - 2 * 4, 2 * (-1) - 5 * 7>\n\nu x v = <(20 - 3), (-21 - 8), (-2 - 35)>\n\nu x v = <17, -29, -37>\n\nNow, we find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n||u x v|| = √(17^2 + (-29)^2 + (-37)^2)\n\n||u x v|| = √(289 + 841 + 1369)\n\n||u x v|| = √(2499)\n\n||u x v|| ≈ 49.99\n\nSo, the magnitude of the cross product of u and v is approximately 49.99."
