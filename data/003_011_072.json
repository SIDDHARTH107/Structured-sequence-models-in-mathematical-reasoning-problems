    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet above the ground. From the plane's current position, the angle of depression to a nearby tower is 25 degrees. What is the distance between the plane and the tower to the nearest foot? (Assume that the ground is flat and level.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in a right triangle. Let's denote the distance between the plane and the tower as d, and the horizontal distance between the plane's vertical projection on the ground and the tower as x. We have a right triangle with a 25-degree angle, a 10,000-foot opposite side (altitude), and an adjacent side x.\n\nUsing the tangent function, we have:\n\ntan(25°) = 10,000 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 10,000 / tan(25°)\nx ≈ 21,286.6 feet\n\nNow that we have the horizontal distance, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the plane and the tower (d):\n\nd^2 = x^2 + (10,000)^2\nd^2 = (21,286.6)^2 + (10,000)^2\nd^2 ≈ 612,372,195.56\nd ≈ √612,372,195.56\nd ≈ 24,746 feet\n\nSo, the distance between the plane and the tower is approximately 24,746 feet to the nearest foot."
