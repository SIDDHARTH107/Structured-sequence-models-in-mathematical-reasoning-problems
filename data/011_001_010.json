    "message_1": "A group of 8 students want to take a group photo, but they can only fit 5 students in the front row. How many different ways can the students be arranged in the front row for the photo?",
    "message_2": "This is a combination problem since we are choosing 5 students from a group of 8, and the order in which they are arranged does not matter. We can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (8) and k is the number of students we want to choose (5).\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!(8-5)!)\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!3!)\n\nC(8, 5) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\n\nC(8, 5) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1)\n\nC(8, 5) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 5) = 56\n\nThere are 56 different ways to arrange the students in the front row for the photo."
