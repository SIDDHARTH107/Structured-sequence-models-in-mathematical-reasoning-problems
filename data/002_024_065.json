    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply add the lengths of all its sides.\n\nPerimeter = (length of first parallel side) + (length of second parallel side) + (length of first non-parallel side) + (length of second non-parallel side)\n\nPerimeter = 5 cm + 8 cm + 4 cm + 4 cm = 21 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 21 cm."
