    "message_2": "The probability of getting a tail in one flip of a fair coin is 1/2. Since the flips are independent events, the probability of getting two tails in a row is the product of the probabilities of getting a tail in each flip. So, the probability of getting two tails in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%."
