The demand for each item follows a normal distribution with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 15. You can only store up to 250 items in the warehouse, and each item costs $10 to purchase. Your goal is to minimize the total cost of inventory while meeting the demand for each item with a probability of at least 95%. Determine how many units of each item you should order.\n\n(Note: This problem involves stochastic optimization, as the demand for each item is assumed to be uncertain and follows a probability distribution.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of service level, which is the probability of not running out of stock. In this case, the desired service level is 95%. We will use the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding z-value for a 95% service level.\n\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, we find that a z-value of 1.645 corresponds to a 95% service level (i.e., 95% of the area under the curve is to the left of z = 1.645).\n\nNow, we will use the formula for calculating the order quantity for each item:\n\nOrder Quantity = Mean Demand + (z-value * Standard Deviation)\n\nFor our problem, the mean demand is 40, the standard deviation is 15, and the z-value is 1.645. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nOrder Quantity = 40 + (1.645 * 15) = 40 + 24.675 = 64.675\n\nSince we cannot order a fraction of an item, we will round up to the nearest whole number. So, we should order 65 units of each item to meet the 95% service level.\n\nHowever, we have a constraint on the total number of items we can store in the warehouse, which is 250 items. Since we have 200 different items, we cannot order 65 units of each item, as that would require storage for 13,000 items (200 * 65).\n\nIn this case, we need to prioritize items based on their demand rates and allocate the available storage space accordingly. However, the problem statement does not provide enough information to make this prioritization. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of units to order for each item within the given constraints."
