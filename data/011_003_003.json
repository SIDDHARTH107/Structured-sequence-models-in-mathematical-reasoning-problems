    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of the 6th term of the expansion of (2x - 3)^8 using Pascal's Triangle, we first need to determine the row of Pascal's Triangle that corresponds to the 8th power. Since Pascal's Triangle starts with the 0th row, the 8th row corresponds to the coefficients of the expansion of a binomial raised to the 7th power. Therefore, we need to look at the 9th row (including the 0th row) for the coefficients of the expansion of (2x - 3)^8.\n\nPascal's Triangle looks like this:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n```\n\nThe 9th row (including the 0th row) is 1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the 6th term in this row. The 6th term is 56.\n\nThe general term of the binomial expansion is given by the formula:\n\n(nCr) * (a^(n-r)) * (b^r)\n\nwhere n is the power to which the binomial is raised, r is the term index (starting from 0), a and b are the terms of the binomial, and nCr is the binomial coefficient (the number from Pascal's Triangle).\n\nFor the 6th term of the expansion of (2x - 3)^8, we have:\n\nn = 8\nr = 5 (since we start counting from 0)\na = 2x\nb = -3\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\n(8C5) * (2x)^(8-5) * (-3)^5\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n56 * (2x)^3 * (-3)^5\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n\n56 * (8x^3) * (-243)\n\nMultiplying the coefficients, we get:\n\n-108864x^3\n\nSo, the coefficient of the 6th term of the expansion of (2x - 3)^8 using Pascal's Triangle is -108864."
