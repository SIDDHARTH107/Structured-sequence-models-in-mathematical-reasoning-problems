    "message_2": "The perimeter of a regular octagon can be found by multiplying the side length by the number of sides. In this case, the side length is 10 cm and there are 8 sides in an octagon. \n\nPerimeter = side length × number of sides\nPerimeter = 10 cm × 8\nPerimeter = 80 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular octagon is 80 cm."
