    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 1  2 -1 | 0 |\n| 2 -3  1 | 0 |\n| 3 -4  2 | 0 |\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2 -1 | 0 |\n| 0 -7  3 | 0 |\n| 0 -10 5 | 0 |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7:\n\n| 1  2 -1 | 0 |\n| 0  1 -3/7 | 0 |\n| 0 -10 5 | 0 |\n\nStep 3: Add 10 times the second row to the third row:\n\n| 1  2 -1 | 0 |\n| 0  1 -3/7 | 0 |\n| 0  0  0 | 0 |\n\nNow, we have the following system of equations:\n\nx + 2y - z = 0\ny - (3/7)z = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\ny = (3/7)z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\nx + 2(3/7)z - z = 0\n\nx + (6/7)z - z = 0\n\nx - (1/7)z = 0\n\nx = (1/7)z\n\nSince this is a homogeneous system, we can express the solution in terms of z:\n\nx = (1/7)z\ny = (3/7)z\nz = z\n\nSo, the solution to the system is:\n\n(x, y, z) = z * (1/7, 3/7, 1)\n\nwhere z is any real number."
