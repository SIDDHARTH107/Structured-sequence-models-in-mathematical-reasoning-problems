They randomly choose 24 boxes of their product and divide them equally between the three packaging designs. After 5 days they open the boxes and record the freshness for each design. The scores are as follows:\n\nDesign 1: 15, 13, 14, 16, 15, 12\nDesign 2: 13, 14, 16, 11, 10, 12\nDesign 3: 14, 15, 17, 13, 12, 11\n\nFind the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for each of the designs. Which design appears to be the best?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the mean, median, and mode for each design:\n\nDesign 1:\nMean: (15+13+14+16+15+12)/6 = 85/6 = 14.17\nMedian: (14+15)/2 = 14.5\nMode: 15\n\nDesign 2:\nMean: (13+14+16+11+10+12)/6 = 76/6 = 12.67\nMedian: (12+13)/2 = 12.5\nMode: None (all values occur only once)\n\nDesign 3:\nMean: (14+15+17+13+12+11)/6 = 82/6 = 13.67\nMedian: (13+14)/2 = 13.5\nMode: None (all values occur only once)\n\nNow, let's find the standard deviation for each design:\n\nDesign 1:\nVariance: [(15-14.17)^2 + (13-14.17)^2 + (14-14.17)^2 + (16-14.17)^2 + (15-14.17)^2 + (12-14.17)^2]/(6-1) = 7.97\nStandard Deviation: √7.97 ≈ 2.82\n\nDesign 2:\nVariance: [(13-12.67)^2 + (14-12.67)^2 + (16-12.67)^2 + (11-12.67)^2 + (10-12.67)^2 + (12-12.67)^2]/(6-1) = 6.27\nStandard Deviation: √6.27 ≈ 2.50\n\nDesign 3:\nVariance: [(14-13.67)^2 + (15-13.67)^2 + (17-13.67)^2 + (13-13.67)^2 + (12-13.67)^2 + (11-13.67)^2]/(6-1) = 7.47\nStandard Deviation: √7.47 ≈ 2.73\n\nBased on the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, Design 1 appears to be the best as it has the highest mean and median freshness scores, a mode, and a relatively low standard deviation."
