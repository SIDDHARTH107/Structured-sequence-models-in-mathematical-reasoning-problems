    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point (2, 2/3), we first need to find the derivative dy/dx at that point. To do this, we will use the chain rule and implicit differentiation.\n\nGiven the equation x^2y^3 + xy = 12, we will differentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^2y^3) + d/dx(xy) = d/dx(12)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n(2x * y^3 + x^2 * 3y^2 * dy/dx) + (y + x * dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we will plug in the point (2, 2/3) into the equation:\n\n(2 * 2 * (2/3)^3 + 2^2 * 3 * (2/3)^2 * dy/dx) + (2/3 + 2 * dy/dx) = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(8/9 + 12/3 * dy/dx) + (2/3 + 2 * dy/dx) = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8/9 + 2/3) + (14/3 * dy/dx) = 0\n\n(8/9 + 6/9) + (14/3 * dy/dx) = 0\n\n(14/9) + (14/3 * dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n\n14/3 * dy/dx = -14/9\n\ndy/dx = (-14/9) / (14/3)\n\ndy/dx = -1/3\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\ny - (2/3) = -1/3(x - 2)\n\ny - 2/3 = -1/3x + 2/3\n\ny = -1/3x + 4/3\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point (2, 2/3) is:\n\ny = -1/3x + 4/3"
