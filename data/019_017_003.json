    "message_2": "The statement ∀x∃y(x + y = 10) means \"for every natural number x, there exists a natural number y such that x + y = 10.\" \n\nLet's check if this statement is true for the natural numbers (integers greater than or equal to 1).\n\n1. For x = 1, we can find y = 9, since 1 + 9 = 10.\n2. For x = 2, we can find y = 8, since 2 + 8 = 10.\n3. For x = 3, we can find y = 7, since 3 + 7 = 10.\n4. For x = 4, we can find y = 6, since 4 + 6 = 10.\n5. For x = 5, we can find y = 5, since 5 + 5 = 10.\n6. For x = 6, we can find y = 4, since 6 + 4 = 10.\n7. For x = 7, we can find y = 3, since 7 + 3 = 10.\n8. For x = 8, we can find y = 2, since 8 + 2 = 10.\n9. For x = 9, we can find y = 1, since 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nAs we can see, for every natural number x, there exists a natural number y such that x + y = 10. Therefore, the truth value of the statement in the natural numbers is true."
