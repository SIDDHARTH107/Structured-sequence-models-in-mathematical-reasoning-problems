    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter. In this case, the diameter is 10 meters. \n\nC = π * 10\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 10\n\nC ≈ 31.4159 meters\n\nThe circumference of the circular garden is approximately 31.4159 meters."
