    "message_2": "To find all solutions to the equation cos(x) = 0.5 for x in the interval [0, 2π), we need to find all angles x whose cosine is 0.5.\n\nWe know that cos(π/3) = 0.5 and cos(5π/3) = 0.5. These are the two angles in the interval [0, 2π) that have a cosine of 0.5.\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation cos(x) = 0.5 for x in the interval [0, 2π) are x = π/3 and x = 5π/3."
