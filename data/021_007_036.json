    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 3. The derivative is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 7\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton-Raphson formula:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nWe are given the initial guess x0 = 1. Let's compute the first iterate x1:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\nx1 = 1 - (1^3 - 5(1)^2 + 7(1) - 3) / (3(1)^2 - 10(1) + 7)\nx1 = 1 - (-1) / 0\nx1 = 1\n\nSince x1 is the same as x0, the Newton-Raphson method has converged to the root after just one iteration. Therefore, the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 3 is x = 1.0000 (rounded to 4 decimal places)."
