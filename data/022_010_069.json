    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z(1+z)}$, we first perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z(1+z)} = \\frac{A}{z} + \\frac{B}{1+z}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $z(1+z)$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(1+z) + Bz$$\n\nSetting $z=0$, we find that $A=1$. Setting $z=-1$, we find that $B=-1$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} - \\frac{1}{1+z}$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series for each term separately. The first term is already in the form of a Laurent series:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{z}$$\n\nFor the second term, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{1+z} = -\\frac{1}{1-(-z)} = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-z)^n = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n z^n$$\n\nCombining the two series, we get the Laurent series for $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n z^n$$\n\nThe convergence of the Laurent series depends on the convergence of the geometric series. The geometric series converges for $|-z| < 1$, which means that the Laurent series converges in the annulus $0 < |z| < 1$."
