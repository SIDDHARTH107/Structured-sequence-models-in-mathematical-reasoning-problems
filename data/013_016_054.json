    "message_1": "Suppose a company hires an employee and offers her two compensation plans. Under plan A, the employee will receive a fixed salary of $75,000 per year. Under plan B, the employee will receive a lower salary of $65,000 per year, but is eligible for a bonus incentive based on the company's profits. If the company's profits are less than $200,000, the employee receives no bonus. If the profits exceed $200,000 but are less than $250,000, the employee receives a bonus equal to 2% of the profits above $200,000. If profits are $250,000 or more, the employee receives a bonus equal to 5% of the profits. The company knows that there is a 30% chance of profits exceeding $250,000 and a 60% chance of profits being between $200,000 and $250,000. What compensation plan should the employee choose if she is risk-neutral?",
    "message_2": "To determine which compensation plan the employee should choose, we need to calculate the expected value of each plan.\n\nFor Plan A, the expected value is straightforward: $75,000 per year.\n\nFor Plan B, we need to consider the probabilities of the different profit scenarios and the corresponding bonuses:\n\n1. 10% chance of profits being less than $200,000: No bonus, so the total compensation is $65,000.\n2. 60% chance of profits being between $200,000 and $250,000: The maximum bonus in this range is 2% of ($250,000 - $200,000) = $1,000. So, the total compensation in this scenario ranges from $65,000 to $66,000.\n3. 30% chance of profits exceeding $250,000: The bonus is 5% of the profits above $250,000. We don't have an exact value for the profits in this case, so we'll assume the average bonus for this scenario.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value of Plan B:\n\nExpected Value (Plan B) = (0.1 * $65,000) + (0.6 * Average Compensation in the $200,000 - $250,000 range) + (0.3 * Average Compensation in the $250,000+ range)\n\nSince the employee is risk-neutral, we can assume that the average compensation in the $200,000 - $250,000 range is halfway between $65,000 and $66,000, which is $65,500. For the $250,000+ range, we don't have enough information to determine the average compensation, so we'll call it X.\n\nExpected Value (Plan B) = (0.1 * $65,000) + (0.6 * $65,500) + (0.3 * X)\n\nTo make Plan B more attractive than Plan A, the expected value of Plan B should be greater than $75,000:\n\n(0.1 * $65,000) + (0.6 * $65,500) + (0.3 * X) > $75,000\n\nNow, we solve for X:\n\n$6,500 + $39,300 + 0.3X > $75,000\n\n0.3X > $29,200\n\nX > $97,333.33\n\nSo, if the average compensation in the $250,000+ profit range is greater than $97,333.33, then Plan B would be more attractive for the risk-neutral employee. However, without more information about the company's profit potential, it's impossible to definitively say which plan the employee should choose."
