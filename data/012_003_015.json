    "message_2": "To determine the size of the maximum independent set in G, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of the maximum independent set (α(G)) and the minimum vertex cover (β(G)) is equal to the number of vertices in the graph (n).\n\nn = α(G) + β(G)\n\nSince G has 7 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the inequality for the minimum vertex cover:\n\nβ(G) ≥ 2 * |E| / (|V| + 1) = 2 * 10 / (7 + 1) = 20 / 8 = 2.5\n\nSince β(G) must be an integer, we can round up to get the smallest possible value for the minimum vertex cover:\n\nβ(G) ≥ 3\n\nNow, we can use the equation relating the maximum independent set, minimum vertex cover, and number of vertices:\n\n7 = α(G) + 3\n\nSolving for α(G), we get:\n\nα(G) = 4\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in G is 4."
