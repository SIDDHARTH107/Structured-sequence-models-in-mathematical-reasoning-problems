    "message_1": "Suppose that a radioactive substance has a half-life of 24 hours. If there is initially 500 grams of the substance, how much will remain after 72 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 500 grams, the half-life is 24 hours, and the time elapsed is 72 hours. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^(72 / 24)\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 62.5 grams\n\nSo, after 72 hours, there will be 62.5 grams of the radioactive substance remaining."
