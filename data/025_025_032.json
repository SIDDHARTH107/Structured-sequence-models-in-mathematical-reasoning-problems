    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the noncommutative algebra of the twisted cubic curve, we first need to analyze the given equations:\n\n1) x*y - z^2 = 0\n2) x*z - y^2 = 0\n3) y*z - x^2 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as z^2 = x*y. Now, let's substitute z^2 from the first equation into the second equation:\n\nx*(x*y) - y^2 = 0 => x^2*y - y^2 = 0\n\nNow, factor out y from the equation:\n\ny*(x^2 - y) = 0\n\nThis equation tells us that either y = 0 or x^2 = y. Let's consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: y = 0\nFrom the third equation, we get:\n\n0*z - x^2 = 0 => x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n\nSo, in this case, we have x = 0, y = 0, and from the first equation, z^2 = 0 => z = 0. This gives us only one point (0, 0, 0).\n\nCase 2: x^2 = y\nNow, let's substitute x^2 for y in the third equation:\n\n(x^2)*z - x^2 = 0 => x^2*(z - 1) = 0\n\nThis equation tells us that either x = 0 or z = 1. If x = 0, we already considered this case above. So, let's consider z = 1:\n\nx^2 = y and z = 1\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\nx*y - 1 = 0 => x*(x^2) - 1 = 0 => x^3 - 1 = 0\n\nThis cubic equation has three solutions for x, which correspond to three different points on the twisted cubic curve. \n\nSo, in total, we have 1 point from Case 1 and 3 points from Case 2, which gives us 4 points in total. Therefore, the dimension of the noncommutative algebra of the twisted cubic curve is 4."
