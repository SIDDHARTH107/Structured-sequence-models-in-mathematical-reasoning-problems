    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 500 liters of water with 10 grams of salt dissolved in it. Salt water enters the tank at a rate of 2 liters per minute with 0.1 grams of salt per liter, and the well-stirred mixture leaves the tank at the same rate. How much salt is in the tank after 30 minutes? (Note: Assume that the tank is well-stirred and that the concentration of salt is uniform throughout.)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time as S(t), where t is the time in minutes. Since the salt water enters the tank at a rate of 2 liters per minute with 0.1 grams of salt per liter, the rate of salt entering the tank is 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 grams per minute.\n\nAt any given time, the concentration of salt in the tank is S(t) / 500, since the volume of the tank remains constant at 500 liters. The rate at which salt leaves the tank is the product of the concentration of salt and the rate at which the water leaves the tank, which is 2 liters per minute. Therefore, the rate of salt leaving the tank is (S(t) / 500) * 2.\n\nNow we can set up a differential equation to describe the rate of change of salt in the tank:\n\ndS/dt = rate of salt entering - rate of salt leaving\ndS/dt = 0.2 - (S(t) / 500) * 2\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫(-2/500)dt) = e^(-t/250). Multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(-t/250) * dS/dt + (2/500) * e^(-t/250) * S(t) = 0.2 * e^(-t/250)\n\nNow the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of S(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt (S(t) * e^(-t/250)) = 0.2 * e^(-t/250)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d(S(t) * e^(-t/250)) = ∫0.2 * e^(-t/250) dt\n\nS(t) * e^(-t/250) = -250 * 0.2 * e^(-t/250) + C\n\nNow we can solve for the constant C using the initial condition S(0) = 10:\n\n10 = -250 * 0.2 + C\nC = 60\n\nSo the equation for the amount of salt in the tank at any time t is:\n\nS(t) * e^(-t/250) = -50 * e^(-t/250) + 60\n\nS(t) = -50 * e^(t/250) + 60 * e^(t/250)\n\nNow we can find the amount of salt in the tank after 30 minutes:\n\nS(30) = -50 * e^(30/250) + 60 * e^(30/250)\nS(30) ≈ 10.98 grams\n\nSo after 30 minutes, there are approximately 10.98 grams of salt in the tank."
