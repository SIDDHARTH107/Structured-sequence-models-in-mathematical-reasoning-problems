    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Polya Enumeration Theorem (PET), which is a combinatorial method for counting objects under a group action, such as rotations and reflections.\n\nLet's first consider the rotations. There are 6 possible rotations for a necklace with 6 beads: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 beads clockwise. The cycle index for the rotation group is given by:\n\nP_rot = (1/6) * (p_1^6 + p_2^3 + 2*p_3^2 + 3*p_6)\n\nNow, let's consider the reflections. There are 6 reflections for a necklace with 6 beads: 3 reflections across an axis through two opposite beads and 3 reflections across an axis through the midpoint of two opposite beads. The cycle index for the reflection group is given by:\n\nP_refl = (1/6) * (3*p_1^2*p_2 + 3*p_1^6)\n\nNow, we need to combine the cycle indices for both rotations and reflections. The combined cycle index is the average of the two cycle indices:\n\nP_comb = (1/2) * (P_rot + P_refl)\n\nP_comb = (1/2) * ((1/6) * (p_1^6 + p_2^3 + 2*p_3^2 + 3*p_6) + (1/6) * (3*p_1^2*p_2 + 3*p_1^6))\n\nNow, we substitute p_i = x for all i (since we have 6 different colors):\n\nP_comb = (1/2) * ((1/6) * (x^6 + x^3 + 2*x^2 + 3*x) + (1/6) * (3*x^2 + 3*x^6))\n\nP_comb = (1/2) * ((1/6) * (x^6 + x^3 + 2*x^2 + 3*x) + (1/2) * (x^2 + x^6))\n\nP_comb = (1/12) * (2*x^6 + x^3 + 4*x^2 + 6*x)\n\nNow, we evaluate P_comb at x = 6 (since we have 6 different colors):\n\nP_comb(6) = (1/12) * (2*6^6 + 6^3 + 4*6^2 + 6*6)\n\nP_comb(6) = (1/12) * (2*46656 + 216 + 144 + 36)\n\nP_comb(6) = (1/12) * (93312 + 396)\n\nP_comb(6) = (1/12) * 93708\n\nP_comb(6) = 7809\n\nSo, there are 7809 distinct necklaces that can be formed using six beads of different colors if rotations and reflections are considered the same."
