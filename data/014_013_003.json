    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHISFUN\" using the Hill Cipher with the given key matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the letters in the message to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n2. Break the message into pairs of letters (since the key matrix is 2x2).\n3. Multiply each pair of letters (represented as a column vector) by the key matrix.\n4. Convert the resulting numerical values back to letters.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Convert letters to numerical values:\n   M=12, A=0, T=19, H=7, I=8, S=18, F=5, U=20, N=13\n\n2. Break the message into pairs:\n   (M,A), (T,H), (I,S), (F,U), (N)\n\n   Since we have an odd number of letters, we need to add an extra letter to make the last pair. We can use the letter 'X' (23) as a filler.\n\n   (M,A), (T,H), (I,S), (F,U), (N,X)\n\n3. Multiply each pair by the key matrix:\n\n   Key matrix:\n   ```\n   1 2\n   3 5\n   ```\n\n   (M,A) = (12,0)\n   Encrypted pair = key matrix * (12,0) = (1*12 + 2*0, 3*12 + 5*0) = (12, 36)\n   Since the result is larger than 25, we need to take the modulus 26: (12, 10)\n\n   (T,H) = (19,7)\n   Encrypted pair = key matrix * (19,7) = (1*19 + 2*7, 3*19 + 5*7) = (33, 76)\n   Modulus 26: (7, 24)\n\n   (I,S) = (8,18)\n   Encrypted pair = key matrix * (8,18) = (1*8 + 2*18, 3*8 + 5*18) = (44, 106)\n   Modulus 26: (18, 4)\n\n   (F,U) = (5,20)\n   Encrypted pair = key matrix * (5,20) = (1*5 + 2*20, 3*5 + 5*20) = (45, 115)\n   Modulus 26: (19, 13)\n\n   (N,X) = (13,23)\n   Encrypted pair = key matrix * (13,23) = (1*13 + 2*23, 3*13 + 5*23) = (59, 142)\n   Modulus 26: (7, 16)\n\n4. Convert the resulting numerical values back to letters:\n   (12, 10) = (M, K)\n   (7, 24) = (H, Y)\n   (18, 4) = (S, E)\n   (19, 13) = (T, N)\n   (7, 16) = (H, Q)\n\nThe encrypted message is \"MKHYSETNHQ\"."
