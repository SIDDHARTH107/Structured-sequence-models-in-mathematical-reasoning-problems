A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components.\n\nCut vertices in G: B, E, F\nExplanation:\n- Removing B disconnects A, D, E, H from C.\n- Removing E disconnects A, B, C from D, H and F, G.\n- Removing F disconnects C from G and the rest of the graph.\n\nBridges in G: (B, C), (E, F), (F, G)\nExplanation:\n- Removing edge (B, C) disconnects C from the rest of the graph.\n- Removing edge (E, F) disconnects F, G from the rest of the graph.\n- Removing edge (F, G) disconnects G from the rest of the graph."
