    "message_2": "Since $\\omega$ is exact at every point in $M$, this means that for every point $p \\in M$, there exists a $(k-1)$-form $\\alpha_p$ such that $\\omega = d\\alpha_p$ in a neighborhood of $p$. Now, let's cover $M$ with open sets $\\{U_i\\}$ such that for each $i$, $\\omega$ is exact on $U_i$, i.e., $\\omega|_{U_i} = d\\alpha_i$ for some $(k-1)$-form $\\alpha_i$ on $U_i$. Since $M$ is a manifold, we can assume that this open cover has a locally finite refinement, meaning that every point in $M$ has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many of the $U_i$'s.\n\nNow, consider the $(k-1)$-form $\\beta_i = \\alpha_i - \\alpha_1$ on $U_i \\cap U_1$. Notice that $d\\beta_i = d\\alpha_i - d\\alpha_1 = \\omega - \\omega = 0$ on $U_i \\cap U_1$. Since $d\\beta_i = 0$, $\\beta_i$ is closed. Moreover, since $M$ is a smooth manifold, we can apply the Poincaré lemma, which states that every closed form is locally exact. Therefore, there exists a $k$-form $\\gamma_i$ on $U_i \\cap U_1$ such that $d\\gamma_i = \\beta_i$.\n\nNow, define a partition of unity $\\{\\rho_i\\}$ subordinate to the open cover $\\{U_i\\}$. This means that $\\rho_i$ is a smooth function with support in $U_i$, and $\\sum_i \\rho_i = 1$ on $M$. Consider the $(k-1)$-form $\\beta = \\sum_i \\rho_i \\beta_i$. We have:\n\n$d\\beta = \\sum_i d(\\rho_i \\beta_i) = \\sum_i (\\rho_i d\\beta_i + d\\rho_i \\wedge \\beta_i) = \\sum_i d\\rho_i \\wedge \\beta_i$.\n\nNow, let's compute $\\omega - d\\beta$:\n\n$\\omega - d\\beta = \\sum_i (\\omega - d\\rho_i \\wedge \\beta_i) = \\sum_i (d\\alpha_i - d\\rho_i \\wedge \\beta_i)$.\n\nOn $U_i \\cap U_1$, we have $\\beta_i = d\\gamma_i$, so:\n\n$\\omega - d\\beta = \\sum_i (d\\alpha_i - d\\rho_i \\wedge d\\gamma_i) = \\sum_i d(\\alpha_i - \\rho_i \\gamma_i)$.\n\nThis means that $\\omega - d\\beta$ is an exact form on each $U_i \\cap U_1$. Since the open cover $\\{U_i\\}$ has a locally finite refinement, this implies that $\\omega - d\\beta$ is exact on $M$. However, since $\\omega$ is closed, we have $d\\omega = 0$, and thus $d(\\omega - d\\beta) = 0$. By the Poincaré lemma, this implies that $\\omega - d\\beta$ is the zero form, and therefore $\\omega = d\\beta$.\n\nSince $\\omega$ is exact, it is the zero form."
