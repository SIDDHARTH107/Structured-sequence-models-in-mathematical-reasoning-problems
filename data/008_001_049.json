    "message_2": "To write the system of linear equations in matrix form, we can represent it as AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe matrix A will be:\n\n| 2  3  1 |\n| 1  2  4 |\n| 3 -1 -2 |\n\nThe matrix X will be:\n\n| x |\n| y |\n| z |\n\nAnd the matrix B will be:\n\n|  7  |\n| 10  |\n| -7  |\n\nSo, the matrix equation will be:\n\n| 2  3  1 | | x |   |  7  |\n| 1  2  4 | | y | = | 10  |\n| 3 -1 -2 | | z |   | -7  |\n\nNow, we can solve for the values of x, y, and z using the inverse of matrix A. If A is invertible, then the solution is given by X = A^(-1)B.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = 1/det(A) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nThe determinant of A can be calculated as:\n\ndet(A) = 2(2(-2) - 4(-1)) - 3(1(-2) - 4(3)) + 1(1(3) - 2(-1))\n       = 2(-4 + 4) - 3(-2 - 12) + 1(3 + 2)\n       = 2(0) + 3(14) + 1(5)\n       = 0 + 42 + 5\n       = 47\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of A:\n\nadj(A) = | (8 - 4)   -(6 - 4)   (6 - 2)  |\n         | -(6 - 8)  (6 - 2)   -(12 - 6) |\n         | (2 + 4)   -(4 + 6)   (4 - 6)  |\n\nadj(A) = |  4  -2   4  |\n         |  2   4  -6  |\n         |  6  -10  -2 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) = 1/47 * |  4  -2   4  |\n                |  2   4  -6  |\n                |  6  -10  -2 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1)B = 1/47 * |  4  -2   4  | |  7  |\n                      |  2   4  -6  | | 10  |\n                      |  6  -10  -2 | | -7  |\n\nX = | (4*7 - 2*10 + 4*(-7))/47 |\n     | (2*7 + 4*10 - 6*(-7))/47 |\n     | (6*7 - 10*10 - 2*(-7))/47 |\n\nX = | (-14)/47 |\n     | (60)/47  |\n     | (-40)/47 |\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -14/47\ny = 60/47\nz = -40/47"
