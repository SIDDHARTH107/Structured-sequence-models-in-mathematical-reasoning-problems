    "message_2": "To show that the given decision problem is NP-complete, we need to prove two things:\n\n1. The problem is in NP.\n2. The problem is NP-hard.\n\n1. The problem is in NP:\n\nA problem is in NP if there exists a non-deterministic Turing machine that can solve the problem in polynomial time. For the given decision problem, we can easily verify a solution in polynomial time. Given a set of integers and a potential subset, we can check if the sum of the integers in the subset is equal to X in O(n) time, where n is the size of the set. Therefore, the problem is in NP.\n\n2. The problem is NP-hard:\n\nTo show that the problem is NP-hard, we will reduce the Subset Sum problem to the given decision problem. The Subset Sum problem is a known NP-complete problem, and it can be stated as follows:\n\n\"Given a set of integers S and an integer target T, determine whether there exists a subset of S that sums to exactly T.\"\n\nNow, let's build a polynomial-time reduction from Subset Sum to the given decision problem. Given an instance of the Subset Sum problem with a set S and a target T, we can create an instance of the given decision problem with the same set S and X = T. Since the set S and target T are the same for both problems, the reduction takes O(1) time, which is a polynomial-time reduction.\n\nNow, let's prove the correctness of the reduction:\n\n- If there exists a subset in S that sums to T in the Subset Sum problem, then there exists a subset in S that sums to X (= T) in the given decision problem.\n- If there does not exist a subset in S that sums to T in the Subset Sum problem, then there does not exist a subset in S that sums to X (= T) in the given decision problem.\n\nSince we have a polynomial-time reduction from the Subset Sum problem to the given decision problem, and the Subset Sum problem is NP-complete, the given decision problem is also NP-hard.\n\nSince the problem is both in NP and NP-hard, we can conclude that the given decision problem is NP-complete."
