    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 6cm and a height of 10cm. Find the surface area of the cone (in square centimeters), rounded to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (the curved part of the cone) and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base:\nArea of the base (A_base) = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (6 cm)^2\nA_base = 36π cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this:\nl^2 = r^2 + h^2\nl^2 = (6 cm)^2 + (10 cm)^2\nl^2 = 36 cm^2 + 100 cm^2\nl^2 = 136 cm^2\nl = √136 cm ≈ 11.7 cm\n\nNow, we can find the lateral area (A_lateral) of the cone:\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nA_lateral = π * (6 cm) * (11.7 cm)\nA_lateral ≈ 70.2π cm^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area (A_total) by adding the base area and the lateral area:\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 36π cm^2 + 70.2π cm^2\nA_total ≈ 106.2π cm^2\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth, the surface area of the cone is approximately 333.4 square centimeters."
