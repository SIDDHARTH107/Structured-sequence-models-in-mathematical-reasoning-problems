    "message_1": "A flagpole is standing vertically on a plain ground. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the pole is 25 degrees. If the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the pole is 15 meters, find the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the height of the flagpole as h and the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the pole as d. In this case, d = 15 meters. The angle of elevation, θ, is 25 degrees.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = h / d\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\ntan(25°) = h / 15\n\nTo find the height, h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15:\n\nh = 15 * tan(25°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of tan(25°):\n\ntan(25°) ≈ 0.4663\n\nNow, multiply this value by 15:\n\nh ≈ 15 * 0.4663\nh ≈ 6.9945\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 6.9945 meters."
