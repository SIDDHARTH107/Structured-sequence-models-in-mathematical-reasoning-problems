    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n\nlog(base 2)((x+7)/(x-5)) = 2\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation to the power of the base (2):\n\n2^(log(base 2)((x+7)/(x-5))) = 2^2\n\nSince 2 raised to the power of the log base 2 of a number is equal to the number itself, we get:\n\n(x+7)/(x-5) = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\nx + 7 = 4(x - 5)\n\nx + 7 = 4x - 20\n\nNow, subtract x from both sides:\n\n3x = 27\n\nFinally, divide by 3:\n\nx = 9\n\nSo, the solution for x is 9."
