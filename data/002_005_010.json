    "message_1": "If a rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, height of 6 cm, and width of 5 cm, what is the length of the diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 5 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal = √(8² + 5² + 6²)\nDiagonal = √(64 + 25 + 36)\nDiagonal = √125\n\nThe length of the diagonal is √125 cm, which is approximately 11.18 cm."
