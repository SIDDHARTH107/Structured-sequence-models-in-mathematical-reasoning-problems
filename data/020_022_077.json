    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of assembly time, 3 hours of painting time, and 1 pound of material, while each unit of product B requires 4 hours of assembly time, 2 hours of painting, and 2 pounds of material. The factory has 200 hours of assembly time, 150 hours of painting time, and 120 pounds of material. The profit per unit of product A is $20, and for product B it is $30. How many units of each type of product should the factory produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for assembly time, painting time, and material are as follows:\n\nAssembly time: 2x + 4y ≤ 200\nPainting time: 3x + 2y ≤ 150\nMaterial: x + 2y ≤ 120\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Assembly time: y ≤ (200 - 2x) / 4\n2. Painting time: y ≤ (150 - 3x) / 2\n3. Material: y ≤ (120 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities. Now, we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of assembly time and painting time constraints:\n   (200 - 2x) / 4 = (150 - 3x) / 2\n   Solving for x, we get x = 20. Substituting x into either equation, we get y = 40. So, the vertex is (20, 40).\n\n2. Intersection of assembly time and material constraints:\n   (200 - 2x) / 4 = (120 - x) / 2\n   Solving for x, we get x = 40. Substituting x into either equation, we get y = 30. So, the vertex is (40, 30).\n\n3. Intersection of painting time and material constraints:\n   (150 - 3x) / 2 = (120 - x) / 2\n   Solving for x, we get x = 30. Substituting x into either equation, we get y = 45. So, the vertex is (30, 45).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (20, 40): 20(20) + 30(40) = $1,600\n2. Profit at (40, 30): 20(40) + 30(30) = $1,800\n3. Profit at (30, 45): 20(30) + 30(45) = $1,950\n\nThe maximum profit is $1,950 when producing 30 units of product A and 45 units of product B."
