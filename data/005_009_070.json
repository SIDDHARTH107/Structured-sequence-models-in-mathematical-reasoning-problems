    "message_1": "A study was conducted on the ages of students in two different universities, University A and University B. The ages (in years) of 7 students from University A are: 22, 19, 20, 23, 21, 22, 18. The ages (in years) of 8 students from University B are: 24, 25, 26, 22, 19, 18, 20, 21. Using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at alpha = 0.05, is there a significant difference in the median ages of students between these two universities?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann-Whitney U test), we first need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the two samples and sort them in ascending order.\n2. Assign ranks to each value (if there are ties, assign the average rank).\n3. Calculate the sum of ranks for each group.\n4. Calculate the test statistic U.\n5. Determine the critical value for the given alpha level.\n6. Compare the test statistic to the critical value and make a decision.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Combined and sorted data: 18, 18, 19, 19, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n2. Assign ranks: \n   University A: 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 12, 14 (sum of ranks = 53.5)\n   University B: 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 11, 13, 15 (sum of ranks = 56.5)\n\n3. Calculate the test statistic U:\n   U_A = n_A * n_B + (n_A * (n_A + 1))/2 - R_A\n   U_B = n_A * n_B + (n_B * (n_B + 1))/2 - R_B\n\n   Where n_A and n_B are the sample sizes of University A and University B, and R_A and R_B are the sum of ranks for University A and University B, respectively.\n\n   U_A = 7 * 8 + (7 * (7 + 1))/2 - 53.5 = 56 - 53.5 = 2.5\n   U_B = 7 * 8 + (8 * (8 + 1))/2 - 56.5 = 56 - 56.5 = -0.5\n\n   Since U_B is negative, we will use U_A as our test statistic: U = 2.5\n\n4. Determine the critical value for alpha = 0.05:\n   For small sample sizes, we can use the critical values table for the Mann-Whitney U test. For n_A = 7 and n_B = 8, the critical value for a two-tailed test at alpha = 0.05 is 23.\n\n5. Compare the test statistic to the critical value:\n   U = 2.5 is less than the critical value of 23.\n\nSince our test statistic is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the median ages of students between University A and University B at the 0.05 significance level."
