    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 7 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(7 cm)³\n\nV = (4/3)π(343 cm³)\n\nV ≈ (4/3)(3.14159)(343 cm³)\n\nV ≈ 1436.76 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately 1436.76 cubic centimeters (cm³)."
