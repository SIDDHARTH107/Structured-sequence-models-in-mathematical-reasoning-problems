The cost function for producing x units is given by: \n\nC(x) = 1000 + 50x + 0.5x^2\n\nWhere x is the number of units produced. Use Newton's method to find the minimum cost of producing 500 units.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost function, we need to find the critical points, which are the points where the derivative of the cost function is equal to zero. Let's first find the derivative of the cost function:\n\nC'(x) = d(C(x))/dx = 50 + x\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the root of the derivative (i.e., where C'(x) = 0). Newton's method is an iterative method that can be used to find the roots of a real-valued function. The formula for Newton's method is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nIn our case, f(x) = C'(x) and f'(x) = d(C'(x))/dx. Let's find the second derivative of the cost function:\n\nC''(x) = d(C'(x))/dx = 1\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method. Let's start with an initial guess of x_0 = 500 (since we want to produce 500 units). We will iterate until the change in x is very small (e.g., less than 0.001).\n\nx_1 = x_0 - C'(x_0) / C''(x_0) = 500 - (50 + 500) / 1 = 500 - 550 = -50\n\nSince the change in x is greater than 0.001, we will continue iterating:\n\nx_2 = x_1 - C'(x_1) / C''(x_1) = -50 - (50 - 50) / 1 = -50\n\nThe value of x did not change after the second iteration, so we have found the critical point x = -50. However, this value does not make sense in the context of the problem, as we cannot produce a negative number of units. Therefore, the minimum cost of producing 500 units will occur at the endpoint x = 500.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum cost by plugging x = 500 into the cost function:\n\nC(500) = 1000 + 50(500) + 0.5(500)^2 = 1000 + 25000 + 125000 = 150000\n\nSo, the minimum cost of producing 500 units is $150,000."
