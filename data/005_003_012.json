Use this equation to predict the exam score of a student who studies for 6 hours.",
    "message_2": "To find the regression equation, we first need to calculate the means of the hours studied and exam scores, as well as the covariance and variance of the hours studied.\n\nMean of Hours Studied (X̄) = (3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 10) / 5 = 34 / 5 = 6.8\nMean of Exam Scores (Ȳ) = (70 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95) / 5 = 420 / 5 = 84\n\nNext, we calculate the covariance and variance of the hours studied:\n\nCovariance = Σ((Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ)) / (n - 1)\nVariance = Σ((Xi - X̄)^2) / (n - 1)\n\nCovariance = ((3-6.8)(70-84) + (5-6.8)(80-84) + (7-6.8)(85-84) + (9-6.8)(90-84) + (10-6.8)(95-84)) / 4\nCovariance = (-3.8 * -14 + (-1.8) * -4 + 0.2 * 1 + 2.2 * 6 + 3.2 * 11) / 4\nCovariance = (53.2 + 7.2 + 0.2 + 13.2 + 35.2) / 4\nCovariance = 108.8 / 4 = 27.2\n\nVariance = ((3-6.8)^2 + (5-6.8)^2 + (7-6.8)^2 + (9-6.8)^2 + (10-6.8)^2) / 4\nVariance = (14.44 + 3.24 + 0.04 + 4.84 + 10.24) / 4\nVariance = 32.8 / 4 = 8.2\n\nNow we can find the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the regression equation:\n\nb = Covariance / Variance = 27.2 / 8.2 = 3.31707317\na = Ȳ - b * X̄ = 84 - 3.31707317 * 6.8 = 84 - 22.55609756 = 61.44390244\n\nSo the regression equation is:\n\nExam Score = 61.44 + 3.32 * Hours Studied\n\nNow we can predict the exam score of a student who studies for 6 hours:\n\nExam Score = 61.44 + 3.32 * 6 = 61.44 + 19.92 = 81.36\n\nTherefore, the predicted exam score for a student who studies for 6 hours is approximately 81.36."
