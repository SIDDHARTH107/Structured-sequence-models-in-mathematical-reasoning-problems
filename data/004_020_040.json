    "message_1": "A 50-pound crate needs to be pulled up a ramp that is 20 feet long and inclined at an angle of 30 degrees with the ground. A force of 80 pounds is applied to pull the crate. How much work is done in pulling the crate up the ramp? Use integration to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done in pulling the crate up the ramp, we need to find the component of the applied force that is parallel to the ramp and then integrate it over the distance of the ramp.\n\nLet F be the applied force (80 pounds), θ be the angle between the applied force and the ramp (30 degrees), and x be the distance along the ramp.\n\nThe component of the applied force parallel to the ramp is F_parallel = F * cos(θ).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle to radians: θ = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians.\n\nNow, we can find the parallel component of the force: F_parallel = 80 * cos(π/6) = 80 * (√3/2) = 40√3 pounds.\n\nThe work done in pulling the crate up the ramp is the integral of the parallel force component over the distance of the ramp:\n\nW = ∫(F_parallel dx) from 0 to 20.\n\nSince F_parallel is constant, the integral simplifies to:\n\nW = F_parallel * ∫(dx) from 0 to 20.\n\nW = 40√3 * (x evaluated from 0 to 20).\n\nW = 40√3 * (20 - 0) = 40√3 * 20 = 800√3 foot-pounds.\n\nSo, the work done in pulling the crate up the ramp is 800√3 foot-pounds."
