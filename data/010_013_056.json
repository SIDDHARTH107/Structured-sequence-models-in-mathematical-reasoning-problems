    "message_1": "Suppose that we have a vector bundle $E$ over a space $X$. If the rank of $E$ is $2$ and the dimension of $X$ is $3$, what is the possible topological invariant that describes the vector bundle $E$?",
    "message_2": "A possible topological invariant that describes the vector bundle $E$ is the first Chern class, denoted as $c_1(E)$. The first Chern class is an element of the cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, and it is used to classify complex line bundles (rank 1) and complex vector bundles of higher rank, such as the given rank 2 bundle $E$ over the 3-dimensional space $X$. \n\nIn this case, since the rank of $E$ is 2, we can consider the first Chern class of the determinant line bundle, $c_1(\\det E)$. The determinant line bundle is a complex line bundle associated with the vector bundle $E$, and its first Chern class can provide information about the topological structure of the original vector bundle $E$."
