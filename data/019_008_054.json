    "message_2": "To evaluate the truth value of the given fuzzy logic statement, we need to first determine the truth values of A and NOT A. Let's consider the membership function of A:\n\n1. A(x) = 0.3 if x ≤ 30\n2. A(x) = (50-x)/20 if 30 < x < 50\n3. A(x) = 0 if x ≥ 50\n\nNow, let's find the membership function of NOT A:\n\n1. NOT A(x) = 1 - A(x) = 0.7 if x ≤ 30\n2. NOT A(x) = 1 - (50-x)/20 if 30 < x < 50\n3. NOT A(x) = 1 - 0 = 1 if x ≥ 50\n\nThe fuzzy logic statement is: IF A is somewhat true AND NOT A is somewhat true THEN A is equally true and not true.\n\nTo determine if A is \"somewhat true\" and NOT A is \"somewhat true,\" we need to find a value of x for which both A(x) and NOT A(x) have non-zero values. Since A(x) = 0.3 for x ≤ 30 and NOT A(x) = 0.7 for x ≤ 30, we can say that A is somewhat true and NOT A is somewhat true for x ≤ 30.\n\nNow, we need to check if A is equally true and not true. This means that A(x) = NOT A(x). For x ≤ 30, A(x) = 0.3 and NOT A(x) = 0.7, which are not equal.\n\nTherefore, the truth value of the given fuzzy logic statement is FALSE."
