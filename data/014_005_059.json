    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to digitally sign a message with a hash function H, using her private key d and the RSA algorithm. If the value of the modulus n is 437 and the value of the exponent d is 17, what is the signature value S of the message M, where H(M) = 267?",
    "message_2": "To compute the signature value S, we use the RSA algorithm with the private key (d, n) and the hash value H(M). The formula for signing a message is:\n\nS ≡ H(M)^d (mod n)\n\nIn this case, H(M) = 267, d = 17, and n = 437. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nS ≡ 267^17 (mod 437)\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the exponentiation by squaring method or a calculator that supports modular exponentiation. The result is:\n\nS ≡ 388 (mod 437)\n\nSo, the signature value S of the message M is 388."
