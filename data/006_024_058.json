    "message_2": "To find the probability of seeing both a whale and an iceberg on the same trip, we need to multiply the individual probabilities together, assuming that the events are independent (meaning that the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event).\n\nProbability of seeing both a whale and an iceberg = (probability of seeing a whale) × (probability of seeing an iceberg)\n\n= 0.4 × 0.6\n= 0.24\n\nSo, the probability of seeing both a whale and an iceberg on the same trip is 0.24 or 24%."
