    "message_1": "In a school election, there are 7 candidates running for 3 positions: president, vice president, and treasurer. In how many ways can the positions be filled if no student can hold more than one position?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the permutation formula, which is n!/(n-r)!, where n is the total number of candidates and r is the number of positions to be filled.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (since there are 7 candidates) and r = 3 (since there are 3 positions: president, vice president, and treasurer).\n\nSo, the permutation formula becomes:\n\nP(7,3) = 7!/(7-3)!\n\nP(7,3) = 7!/4!\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nNow, divide 7! by 4!:\n\nP(7,3) = 5,040/24 = 210\n\nTherefore, there are 210 different ways to fill the 3 positions with the 7 candidates."
