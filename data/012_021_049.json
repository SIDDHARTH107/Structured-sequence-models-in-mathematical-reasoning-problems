    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of G, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and the tree satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For any vertex v, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nWe can find a tree decomposition of G as follows:\n\n1. Bag A: {1, 2, 3}\n2. Bag B: {2, 3, 4}\n3. Bag C: {2, 3, 5}\n4. Bag D: {3, 4, 5}\n5. Bag E: {4, 5, 6}\n6. Bag F: {5, 6, 7}\n7. Bag G: {6, 7, 8}\n\nThe tree structure can be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-G.\n\nThis tree decomposition satisfies all three conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, which is the set of vertices of G.\n2. For each edge in G, there exists a bag containing both vertices of the edge.\n3. For any vertex, the bags containing it form a connected subtree.\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus one. In this case, the largest bag size is 3, so the treewidth of G is 3 - 1 = 2."
