    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is typically used for continuous optimization problems. Here's a simplified version of the algorithm to find the maximum value of f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 5:\n\n1. Initialize the population of n host nests (solutions) randomly within the search space (e.g., x in the range [-10, 10]).\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (i.e., calculate f(x) for each nest).\n3. Perform the following steps for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met:\n   a. Select a cuckoo (solution) randomly and generate a new solution by performing a random walk (Levy flight) in the search space.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. Choose a random nest from the population and compare its fitness with the new solution. If the new solution is better, replace the nest with the new solution.\n   d. With a probability p, replace a fraction of the worst nests with new random solutions.\n   e. Evaluate the fitness of the updated population and keep track of the best solution found so far.\n\nAfter the algorithm has finished, the best solution found represents the approximate maximum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x.\n\nNote that the Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a stochastic algorithm, and the results may vary between different runs. To obtain more accurate results, you can either increase the population size, the number of iterations, or run the algorithm multiple times and take the average of the results.\n\nHowever, for this specific problem, it's worth noting that you can find the exact maximum value of f(x) and the corresponding x value by taking the derivative of the function and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = -2x + 2\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n\n0 = -2x + 2\nx = 1\n\nNow, plug x = 1 back into the original function:\n\nf(1) = -(1)^2 + 2(1) + 5\nf(1) = 6\n\nSo, the maximum value of f(x) is 6, and it occurs at x = 1."
