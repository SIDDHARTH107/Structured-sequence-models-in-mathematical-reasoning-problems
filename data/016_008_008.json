    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not depend on the number of iterations or the length of the original line segment. It is a constant value that characterizes the fractal nature of the curve.\n\nTo find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each line segment is replaced by 4 new segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, N = 4 and s = 3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619, regardless of the number of iterations or the length of the original line segment."
