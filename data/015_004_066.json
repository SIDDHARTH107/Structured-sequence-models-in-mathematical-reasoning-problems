    "message_2": "The boundary escape radius for the Mandelbrot set is the value of |z| beyond which the sequence generated by the iterative equation z = z^2 + c is guaranteed to diverge. The escape radius is typically set to 2, as it has been proven that if |z| > 2, the sequence will diverge.\n\nIn the case of the Mandelbrot set equation z = z^2 + c, where c = 0.02 + 0.45i, the escape radius remains the same, which is 2."
