    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain stock price to increase by 15% is 0.60, and the probability of it decreasing by 10% is 0.40. If the current stock price is $100, what is the expected value of the stock price after one day?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the stock price after one day, we need to consider both scenarios: the stock price increasing by 15% and decreasing by 10%. We will calculate the expected value by multiplying the probability of each scenario by the corresponding stock price and then summing the results.\n\nScenario 1: Stock price increases by 15%\nProbability: 0.60\nNew stock price: $100 * 1.15 = $115\n\nScenario 2: Stock price decreases by 10%\nProbability: 0.40\nNew stock price: $100 * 0.90 = $90\n\nNow, we calculate the expected value:\n\nExpected value = (Probability of Scenario 1 * Stock price in Scenario 1) + (Probability of Scenario 2 * Stock price in Scenario 2)\nExpected value = (0.60 * $115) + (0.40 * $90)\nExpected value = $69 + $36\nExpected value = $105\n\nThe expected value of the stock price after one day is $105."
