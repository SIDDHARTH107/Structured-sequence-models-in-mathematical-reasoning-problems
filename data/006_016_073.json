    "message_1": "A manufacturing process produces 1000 headphones per day. The probability of a certain type of defect in one headphone is 0.05. What is the probability of having at least 2 defective headphones in a random sample of 50 headphones from the daily production?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective headphones\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the sample size (50 headphones in this case)\n- k is the number of defective headphones\n- p is the probability of a defect (0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of not having a defect (0.95)\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 2 defective headphones, which means we need to find the probability of having 2, 3, 4, ..., 50 defective headphones and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of having 0 or 1 defective headphones and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\n\nFirst, let's find P(X = 0):\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (0.95)^50\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^50\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.000002\n\nNext, let's find P(X = 1):\n\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (0.95)^49\nP(X = 1) = 50 * 0.05 * (0.95)^49\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.000104\n\nNow, we can find P(X ≥ 2):\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.000002 - 0.000104\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 0.999894\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 2 defective headphones in a random sample of 50 headphones from the daily production is approximately 0.999894 or 99.99%."
