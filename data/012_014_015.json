    "message_2": "G and H cannot be isomorphic because they have a different number of edges. Isomorphic graphs must have the same number of vertices and edges, as well as the same degree sequence. Since G has 7 edges and H has 6 edges, they cannot be isomorphic, and there is no isomorphism between them."
