    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit of A is $50 and for B it is $90. The company has a capacity to produce a maximum of 300 units per day. The production of A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while the production of B requires 6 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The company wants to determine the optimal number of units of A and B to produce in order to maximize the profit. Use particle swarm optimization to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function\n2. Initialize the swarm\n3. Update the particle positions and velocities\n4. Update the personal best and global best positions\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize profit = 50 * A + 90 * B\n\nConstraints:\nA + B <= 300 (maximum units per day)\n3 * A + 6 * B <= L (total labor hours available)\n2 * A + 3 * B <= M (total machine hours available)\n\nInitialize the swarm:\nChoose the number of particles (e.g., 50) and randomly initialize their positions (A, B) within the feasible search space. Initialize the velocities of the particles to zero.\n\nUpdate the particle positions and velocities:\nFor each particle, update its position and velocity using the following equations:\n\nv_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * r1 * (p_best_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * r2 * (g_best - x_i(t))\nx_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n\nwhere:\n- v_i(t) is the velocity of particle i at time t\n- x_i(t) is the position of particle i at time t\n- w is the inertia weight (e.g., 0.7)\n- c1 and c2 are acceleration constants (e.g., 2)\n- r1 and r2 are random numbers between 0 and 1\n- p_best_i is the personal best position of particle i\n- g_best is the global best position\n\nUpdate the personal best and global best positions:\nFor each particle, if its current position yields a higher profit than its personal best position, update its personal best position. If the current position yields a higher profit than the global best position, update the global best position.\n\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum change in the global best position).\n\nAfter the algorithm converges, the global best position (A, B) will represent the optimal number of units of products A and B to produce in order to maximize the profit, considering the constraints. Note that the labor hours (L) and machine hours (M) constraints must be provided to solve the problem."
