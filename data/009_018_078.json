    "message_2": "First, we need to find the complementary solution yc(t) by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\ny'' + 2y' + 2y = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 2r + 2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots:\n\nr = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4 * 2)) / 2 = -1 ± i\n\nSince the roots are complex, the complementary solution is of the form:\n\nyc(t) = e^(-t) (C1 * cos(t) + C2 * sin(t))\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution yp(t) for the non-homogeneous equation:\n\ny'' + 2y' + 2y = cos(t)\n\nWe assume a particular solution of the form:\n\nyp(t) = A * cos(t) + B * sin(t)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives:\n\nyp'(t) = -A * sin(t) + B * cos(t)\nyp''(t) = -A * cos(t) - B * sin(t)\n\nSubstituting yp(t), yp'(t), and yp''(t) into the non-homogeneous equation:\n\n(-A * cos(t) - B * sin(t)) + 2(-A * sin(t) + B * cos(t)) + 2(A * cos(t) + B * sin(t)) = cos(t)\n\nSimplifying and grouping the terms:\n\n(A + 2B) * cos(t) + (-2A + B) * sin(t) = cos(t)\n\nFor the equation to hold true for all t, we must have:\n\nA + 2B = 1\n-2A + B = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nA = 1/5\nB = 2/5\n\nSo the particular solution is:\n\nyp(t) = (1/5) * cos(t) + (2/5) * sin(t)\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\ny(t) = yc(t) + yp(t) = e^(-t) (C1 * cos(t) + C2 * sin(t)) + (1/5) * cos(t) + (2/5) * sin(t)\n\nNow we apply the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 0 => e^(0) (C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)) + (1/5) * cos(0) + (2/5) * sin(0) = 0\nC1 + 1/5 = 0 => C1 = -1/5\n\ny'(0) = 1 => -e^(0) (C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)) + e^(0) (-C1 * sin(0) + C2 * cos(0)) = 1\n-(-1/5) + C2 = 1 => C2 = 4/5\n\nSo the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-t) ((-1/5) * cos(t) + (4/5) * sin(t)) + (1/5) * cos(t) + (2/5) * sin(t)"
