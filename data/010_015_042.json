Suppose that α is a closed 2-form and β is a closed 1-form on M, such that\n\n∫M α ∧ β = 5.\n   \nUsing De Rham cohomology, what is the numerical value of \n\n∫M α ∧ ω ∧ β?",
    "message_2": "Since M is a three-dimensional manifold, the volume form ω is a 3-form. We are given that α is a closed 2-form and β is a closed 1-form. We want to compute the integral of α ∧ ω ∧ β over M.\n\nFirst, notice that the wedge product is associative and anti-commutative. Therefore, we can rearrange the terms in the integrand:\n\nα ∧ ω ∧ β = α ∧ (ω ∧ β).\n\nNow, since ω is a 3-form and β is a 1-form, their wedge product ω ∧ β is a 4-form. However, M is a three-dimensional manifold, so there are no non-trivial 4-forms on M. In other words, ω ∧ β = 0.\n\nThus, the integrand becomes:\n\nα ∧ (ω ∧ β) = α ∧ 0 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the integral of α ∧ ω ∧ β over M is:\n\n∫M α ∧ ω ∧ β = ∫M 0 = 0.\n\nSo, the numerical value of the integral is 0."
