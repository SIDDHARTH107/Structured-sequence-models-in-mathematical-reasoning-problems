    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from an initial large square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. \n\nLet's denote the number of squares in the nth iteration as S(n). In the first iteration (n=1), we start with a single square and remove the middle square, leaving 8 squares. \n\nFor the second iteration (n=2), each of the 8 squares from the previous iteration is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square is removed from each, resulting in 8 * (9 - 1) = 8 * 8 = 64 squares.\n\nIn general, for the nth iteration, the total number of squares is given by the formula:\n\nS(n) = 8^n\n\nFor the 5th iteration (n=5), the total number of squares is:\n\nS(5) = 8^5 = 32,768"
