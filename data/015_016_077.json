    "message_1": "A Chua circuit has a parameter ùõæ = 14.92. At time t = 0, the initial conditions of the circuit are x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, and z(0) = 0. If the input voltage V = 7V, find the numerical value of x(10), y(10) and z(10).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Chua circuit equations and integrate them over time. The Chua circuit is a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the behavior of the circuit variables x(t), y(t), and z(t). The equations are:\n\ndx/dt = Œ± * (y - x - h(x))\ndy/dt = x - y + z\ndz/dt = -Œ≤ * y - Œ≥ * z\n\nwhere Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ are parameters of the circuit, and h(x) is a piecewise-linear function representing the nonlinear resistor in the circuit. The input voltage V is not directly involved in these equations, but it affects the parameters Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥.\n\nGiven the parameter Œ≥ = 14.92, we still need the values of Œ± and Œ≤, as well as the function h(x), to solve the system of ODEs. Without this information, we cannot find the numerical values of x(10), y(10), and z(10).\n\nIf you provide the missing information, we can proceed with solving the problem."
