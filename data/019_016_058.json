    "message_2": "1. The intersection of the two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements that are in both sets. In this case, the intersection is $\\{4, 5\\}$.\n\n2. The union of the two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements that are in either set or both. In this case, the union is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$.\n\n3. The complement of set $A$ depends on the universal set, which is not provided. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. For example, if the universal set is the set of integers from 1 to 10, then the complement of set $A$ would be $\\{6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\n\n4. The difference between set $B$ and set $A$ is the set of elements that are in $B$ but not in $A$. In this case, the difference is $\\{6, 7\\}$.\n\n5. The power set of set $A$ is the set of all possible subsets of $A$. In this case, the power set is:\n\n$\\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4\\}, \\{5\\}, \\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{1, 4\\}, \\{1, 5\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\}, \\{2, 5\\}, \\{3, 4\\}, \\{3, 5\\}, \\{4, 5\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\}, \\{1, 2, 4\\}, \\{1, 2, 5\\}, \\{1, 3, 4\\}, \\{1, 3, 5\\}, \\{1, 4, 5\\}, \\{2, 3, 4\\}, \\{2, 3, 5\\}, \\{2, 4, 5\\}, \\{3, 4, 5\\}, \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}, \\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}, \\{1, 2, 4, 5\\}, \\{1, 3, 4, 5\\}, \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}, \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\}$"
