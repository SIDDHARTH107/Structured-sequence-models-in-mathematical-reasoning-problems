    "message_2": "To solve for y, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 12\n\nFirst, subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n3y = -2x + 12\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\ny = (-2/3)x + 4\n\nThis is now in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nThe slope (m) is -2/3, and the y-intercept (b) is 4.\n\nTo plot the graph, start at the y-intercept (0, 4) on the coordinate plane. From this point, use the slope to find the next point on the line. Since the slope is -2/3, go down 2 units and to the right 3 units. This will give you the point (3, 2). Continue this process to plot more points and draw the line.\n\nThe graph of the equation 2x + 3y = 12 is a straight line with a slope of -2/3 and a y-intercept of 4."
