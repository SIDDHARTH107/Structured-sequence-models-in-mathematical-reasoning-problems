    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we first note that 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their properties.\n\nLet G be a group of order 60. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's third theorem, n_2 divides 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, 5, or 15. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. In this case, G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By Sylow's third theorem, n_3 divides 20 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: By Sylow's third theorem, n_5 divides 12 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, we analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and G is abelian. This case does not give a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups. Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, we have G ≅ C_3 ⋊ C_5, which is abelian. This case does not give a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 2 and 5-subgroups. Since the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal, we have G ≅ C_5 ⋊ C_4. There are two non-abelian groups in this case: the dihedral group D_20 and the non-abelian group of order 20 with a presentation ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^2⟩.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups. There is one non-abelian group in this case: the symmetric group S_5.\n\nIn total, there are 3 non-abelian groups of order 60. Their corresponding group presentations are:\n\n1. Dihedral group D_20: ⟨a, b | a^10 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩\n2. Non-abelian group of order 20: ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^2⟩\n3. Symmetric group S_5: ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^3 = 1, (ab)^2 = 1⟩"
