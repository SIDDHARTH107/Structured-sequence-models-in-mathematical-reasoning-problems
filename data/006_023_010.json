    "message_1": "A company wants to determine the probability of selling at least 10 products in a day at their retail store. Historical data shows that on average they sell 8 products per day with a standard deviation of 2. What is the probability of selling at least 10 products in a day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Z-score formula to standardize the data and then find the probability using a standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 10 (at least 10 products), μ = 8 (average products sold per day), and σ = 2 (standard deviation).\n\nZ = (10 - 8) / 2\nZ = 2 / 2\nZ = 1\n\nNow that we have the Z-score, we can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a Z-table) to find the probability. The Z-table gives us the probability of a value being less than or equal to a given Z-score. Since we want to find the probability of selling at least 10 products, we need to find the probability of selling more than the Z-score of 1.\n\nLooking up a Z-score of 1 in the Z-table, we find a probability of 0.8413. This means there is an 84.13% chance of selling less than or equal to 10 products. However, we want the probability of selling at least 10 products, so we need to find the complement of this probability.\n\nP(at least 10 products) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 10 products)\nP(at least 10 products) = 1 - 0.8413\nP(at least 10 products) = 0.1587\n\nSo, there is approximately a 15.87% chance of selling at least 10 products in a day at the retail store."
