    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, denoted by A', we need to find all the elements in set X that are not in set A. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nX = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nA' = {4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, to prove that the complement of set A is unique, we need to show that there can be no other set B' such that B' is also the complement of set A with respect to set X.\n\nAssume there exists another set B' which is also the complement of set A with respect to set X. This means that B' contains all the elements in X that are not in A.\n\nSince A and X are fixed sets, the elements that are not in A will always be the same. Therefore, B' must also contain the same elements as A', which are {4, 5, 6}. \n\nThis implies that B' = A', and there can be no other set that is the complement of set A with respect to set X. Thus, the complement of set A is unique."
