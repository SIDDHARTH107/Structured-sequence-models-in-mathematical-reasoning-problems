    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs wants to estimate the average lifetime of its bulbs. A sample of 50 light bulbs has a mean lifetime of 1200 hours and a standard deviation of 200 hours. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime of the light bulbs.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime of the light bulbs, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean (1200 hours)\nZ = Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\nσ = sample standard deviation (200 hours)\nn = sample size (50 light bulbs)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 200 / √50 ≈ 28.28\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 28.28 ≈ 55.43\n\nFinally, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower limit = x̄ - ME = 1200 - 55.43 ≈ 1144.57 hours\nUpper limit = x̄ + ME = 1200 + 55.43 ≈ 1255.43 hours\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime of the light bulbs is approximately (1144.57 hours, 1255.43 hours)."
