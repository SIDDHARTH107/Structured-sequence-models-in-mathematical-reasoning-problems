    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log2(x - 4) - log2(3) = 1, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the subtraction property of logarithms, which states that logb(a) - logb(c) = logb(a/c). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog2((x - 4)/3) = 1\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that logb(a) = c is equivalent to a = b^c. In our case, this means:\n\n(x - 4)/3 = 2^1\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n(x - 4)/3 = 2\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:\n\nx - 4 = 6\n\nFinally, add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate x:\n\nx = 10\n\nSo, the solution to the logarithmic equation is x = 10."
