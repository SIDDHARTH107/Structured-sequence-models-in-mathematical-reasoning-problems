    "message_2": "In an equilateral triangle, all three sides are of equal length. To find the length of one side, we can simply divide the perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nPerimeter = 18 cm\nNumber of sides = 3\n\nLength of one side = Perimeter / Number of sides = 18 cm / 3 = 6 cm\n\nThe length of a side in the equilateral triangle is 6 cm."
