    "message_2": "To calculate the moving average with a period of 4, we will first find the average of each set of 4 consecutive quarters. Then, we will find the average of these averages to determine the trend. Finally, we will use this trend to predict the sales for Q1 and Q2 in 2021.\n\nMoving Averages:\n\n1. (40+45+35+50)/4 = 42.5\n2. (50+55+45+60)/4 = 52.5\n3. (60+65+55+70)/4 = 62.5\n4. (70+75+65+80)/4 = 72.5\n5. (80+85+75+90)/4 = 82.5\n6. (90+95+85+100)/4 = 92.5\n7. (100+105+95+110)/4 = 102.5\n8. (110+115+105+120)/4 = 112.5\n9. (120+125+115+130)/4 = 122.5\n10. (130+135+125+140)/4 = 132.5\n\nAverage of Moving Averages (Trend):\n(42.5+52.5+62.5+72.5+82.5+92.5+102.5+112.5+122.5+132.5)/10 = 87.5\n\nNow, we will use this trend to predict the sales for Q1 and Q2 in 2021. Since the trend is increasing by 10 units every year, we can predict the sales for Q1 and Q2 in 2021 as follows:\n\nQ1 2021: 130 (Q1 2020) + 10 = 140\nQ2 2021: 135 (Q2 2020) + 10 = 145\n\nSo, the predicted sales for Q1 and Q2 in 2021 are 140,000 and 145,000 units, respectively."
