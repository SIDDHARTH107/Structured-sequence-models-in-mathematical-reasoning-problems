    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartesian product of two sets, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from the first set and the second element from the second set.\n\nFirst, let's calculate A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's calculate (A × B) × {5}:\nTo do this, we take the Cartesian product of the set A × B with the set {5}. Since A × B has 4 elements, we will have 4 ordered pairs in the resulting set.\n(A × B) × {5} = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nNext, let's calculate B × {5}:\nB × {5} = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, let's calculate A × (B × {5}):\nTo do this, we take the Cartesian product of the set A with the set B × {5}. Since A has 2 elements and B × {5} has 2 elements, we will have 4 ordered pairs in the resulting set.\nA × (B × {5}) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nNow, let's verify if the Cartesian product is associative:\n(A × B) × {5} = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\nA × (B × {5}) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nAlthough the ordered pairs in both sets look different, they represent the same relationships between the elements of sets A, B, and {5}. We can rewrite the ordered pairs in (A × B) × {5} as follows:\n\n(A × B) × {5} = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nNow, we can see that both sets are equal:\n\n(A × B) × {5} = A × (B × {5}) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nThus, the Cartesian product of two sets is associative."
