    "message_1": "Consider the ordinary differential equation: \n\ny''(t) + 2y'(t) + 4y(t) = 4u(t)\n\nwhere y(t) is the output and u(t) is the control input. The initial conditions are y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0. The goal is to find the control input u(t) that minimizes the following objective function: \n\nJ = ∫_{0}^{T} [(y(t) - 1)^2 + u(t)^2] dt\n\nwhere T = 5 is the final time. \n\nUsing the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, find the optimal control input that minimizes the objective function, and compute the corresponding optimal output y(t).",
    "message_2": "To apply the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we first introduce the Hamiltonian function H, which is given by:\n\nH(y, y', p, p', u) = (y - 1)^2 + u^2 + p'(y'' + 2y' + 4y - 4u)\n\nwhere p(t) and p'(t) are the costate variables.\n\nThe necessary conditions for the optimal control are:\n\n1. The optimal control input u*(t) minimizes the Hamiltonian:\n\n∂H/∂u = 0\n\n2u - 4p' = 0\n\nu*(t) = p'(t)/2\n\n2. The costate equations are given by the negative partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to the state variables:\n\np'(t) = -∂H/∂y = -2(y - 1) - 4p\n\np''(t) = -∂H/∂y' = -2p'\n\n3. The transversality conditions are:\n\np(T) = 0, p'(T) is unconstrained.\n\nNow, we can substitute the optimal control input u*(t) into the costate equations:\n\np'(t) = -2(y - 1) - 4p\n\np''(t) = -2p'/2 = -p'\n\nAnd the system dynamics:\n\ny''(t) + 2y'(t) + 4y(t) = 4u*(t) = 2p'(t)\n\nNow we have a system of four first-order differential equations:\n\ny'(t) = z(t)\nz'(t) = 2p'(t) - 2z(t) - 4y(t)\np'(t) = q(t)\nq'(t) = -p'(t) - 2(y(t) - 1) - 4p(t)\n\nWith the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 0\nz(0) = y'(0) = 0\np(T) = 0\np'(T) is unconstrained.\n\nWe can solve this system of differential equations using numerical methods (e.g., the Runge-Kutta method) to obtain the optimal control input u*(t) and the corresponding optimal output y(t)."
