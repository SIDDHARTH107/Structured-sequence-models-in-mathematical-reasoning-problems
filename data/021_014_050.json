    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using a genetic algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each candidate solution.\n3. Select the best candidates based on their fitness.\n4. Apply crossover and mutation to generate new candidate solutions.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of generations).\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the genetic algorithm:\n\n1. Initialization:\nGenerate an initial population of N candidate solutions (x, y) randomly, where x and y are within the constraints.\n\n2. Fitness evaluation:\nCalculate the fitness of each candidate solution using the objective function f(x, y) = -x^2 - y^2. Since we want to maximize f(x, y), higher fitness values correspond to better solutions.\n\n3. Selection:\nSelect the top M candidates with the highest fitness values to form a mating pool.\n\n4. Crossover:\nRandomly pair the selected candidates and perform crossover to generate new offspring. For example, if we have two parent solutions (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we can create two offspring solutions by swapping their x and y values: (x1, y2) and (x2, y1).\n\n5. Mutation:\nApply mutation to the offspring solutions with a certain probability. For example, we can add a small random value to x and/or y.\n\n6. Replacement:\nReplace the least-fit candidates in the population with the newly generated offspring.\n\n7. Stopping criterion:\nRepeat steps 2-6 until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of generations or finding a solution with a fitness value close enough to the optimal value.\n\nAfter the algorithm stops, the candidate solution with the highest fitness value in the final population is considered the best solution found by the genetic algorithm. This solution will provide an approximation of the maximum value of f(x, y) and the corresponding values of x and y. Note that the genetic algorithm does not guarantee finding the exact optimal solution, but it can often find a good approximation."
