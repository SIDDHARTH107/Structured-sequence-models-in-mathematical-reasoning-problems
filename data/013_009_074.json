    "message_1": "Suppose two players, Alice and Bob, are playing the matching pennies game. Alice chooses \"heads\" or \"tails\" by placing a penny on her left or right hand, and Bob guesses which hand it's under. If Bob guesses correctly, he wins the penny from Alice; if he guesses wrongly, he gives Alice a penny. If both players randomly choose \"heads\" or \"tails,\" what is the expected value for Alice's winnings after 100 games?",
    "message_2": "In the matching pennies game, both players randomly choose \"heads\" or \"tails\" with equal probability. So, the probability of Bob guessing correctly is 1/2, and the probability of him guessing wrongly is also 1/2.\n\nWhen Bob guesses correctly, Alice loses a penny, and when he guesses wrongly, she wins a penny. Let's calculate the expected value for Alice's winnings in a single game:\n\nExpected value = (probability of winning) * (amount won) + (probability of losing) * (amount lost)\nExpected value = (1/2) * (+1 penny) + (1/2) * (-1 penny)\nExpected value = (+1/2) + (-1/2)\nExpected value = 0\n\nSince the expected value for Alice's winnings in a single game is 0, the expected value for her winnings after 100 games will also be 0. This is because the expected value is linear, so the expected value of the sum of 100 games is equal to the sum of the expected values of each game:\n\nExpected value after 100 games = 100 * (expected value of a single game)\nExpected value after 100 games = 100 * 0\nExpected value after 100 games = 0\n\nSo, the expected value for Alice's winnings after 100 games is 0."
