    "message_2": "In a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) in dimension 2, the partition function is a topological invariant. This means that the value assigned to a closed surface depends only on its topology, not on any specific geometric features.\n\nFor a 2-dimensional TQFT, the partition function Z(M) is assigned to a closed 2-manifold M. In this case, we are given that the TQFT assigns the number 1 to the circle (which is a closed 1-manifold). \n\nNow, we need to find the number assigned to a closed surface of genus g. A closed surface of genus g can be constructed by taking a 2g-gon and identifying its edges in pairs. This is equivalent to gluing 2g circles together along their boundaries. \n\nUsing the property of TQFTs that the partition function is multiplicative under disjoint unions, we can write the partition function for the closed surface of genus g as:\n\nZ(closed surface of genus g) = Z(circle)^{2g}\n\nSince the TQFT assigns the number 1 to the circle, we have:\n\nZ(closed surface of genus g) = 1^{2g} = 1\n\nSo, the number assigned to the closed surface of genus g by the TQFT is 1."
