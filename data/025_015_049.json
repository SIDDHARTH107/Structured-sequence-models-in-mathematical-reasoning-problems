    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane that passes through the points (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9), we first need to find two vectors that lie in the plane. We can do this by subtracting the coordinates of the points:\n\nVector A = (4-1, 5-2, 6-3) = (3, 3, 3)\nVector B = (7-1, 8-2, 9-3) = (6, 6, 6)\n\nNow, we need to find the normal vector to the plane, which is the cross product of vectors A and B:\n\nNormal vector N = A x B = (3i + 3j + 3k) x (6i + 6j + 6k)\n\nHowever, we can see that vectors A and B are parallel (B is just 2 times A), so their cross product will be the zero vector. This means that the three points are collinear (lie on a straight line), and there is no unique plane that passes through all three points. In this case, an infinite number of planes can pass through these points."
