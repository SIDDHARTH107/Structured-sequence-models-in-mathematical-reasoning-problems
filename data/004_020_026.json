    "message_2": "To find the work done using integration, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = ∫(Force * distance)\n\nSince the force is constant (10 N) and is applied in the direction of the distance (5 meters), we can integrate the force with respect to the distance.\n\nWork = ∫(10 * dx) from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nWork = 10 * ∫(dx) from 0 to 5\n\nWork = 10 * [x] from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = 10 * (5 - 0)\n\nWork = 10 * 5\n\nWork = 50 J\n\nSo, the work done is 50 Joules."
