    "message_2": "The Menger Sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, smaller cubes are removed from the larger cube, following a specific pattern.\n\nIn the first iteration, 20 smaller cubes remain.\nIn the second iteration, 20^2 = 400 smaller cubes remain.\nIn the third iteration, 20^3 = 8,000 smaller cubes remain.\n\nSo, in the 3rd iteration of the Menger Sponge, there are a total of 8,000 smaller cubes."
