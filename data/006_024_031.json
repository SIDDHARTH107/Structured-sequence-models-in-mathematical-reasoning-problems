If the person also books a rental car, there is a 10% chance that the car will not be available. What is the probability that both the flight will be delayed and the rental car will not be available?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both events occur, we multiply the individual probabilities together.\n\nProbability of flight delay = 20% = 0.20\nProbability of rental car unavailability = 10% = 0.10\n\nProbability of both events occurring = 0.20 * 0.10 = 0.02\n\nSo, there is a 2% chance that both the flight will be delayed and the rental car will not be available."
