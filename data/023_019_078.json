    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the given system of differential equations, we first need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial (2x + 5y)}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial (2x + 5y)}{\\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (-3x + 4y)}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial (-3x + 4y)}{\\partial y}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 5 \\\\\n-3 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the origin, which means we need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix at the point (x, y) = (0, 0). Since the Jacobian matrix does not depend on x and y, it remains the same at the origin:\n\n$$\nJ(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 5 \\\\\n-3 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues of this matrix. To do this, we compute the determinant of (J - λI), where λ is an eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix:\n\n$$\n\\det(J - λI) = \\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 - λ & 5 \\\\\n-3 & 4 - λ\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n$$\n(2 - λ)(4 - λ) - (-3)(5) = λ^2 - 6λ + 8 + 15 = λ^2 - 6λ + 23\n$$\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation:\n\n$$\nλ^2 - 6λ + 23 = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the eigenvalues:\n\n$$\nλ = \\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(23)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 92}}{2}\n$$\n\nSince the discriminant (36 - 92) is negative, the eigenvalues are complex:\n\n$$\nλ = 3 \\pm i\\sqrt{14}\n$$\n\nThe real part of both eigenvalues is positive (3), so the system is unstable at the origin."
