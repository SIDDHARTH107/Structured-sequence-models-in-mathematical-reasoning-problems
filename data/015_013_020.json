    "message_1": "Consider the logistic map function given by:\n\nx[n+1] = r * x[n] * (1 - x[n])\n\nwhere x[n] is the population density at time \"n\" and \"r\" is a constant parameter that represents the rate of growth. \n\nIf \"r\" takes the value of 4, find the steady-state population density of the logistic map.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state population density, we need to find the value of x[n] when x[n+1] = x[n]. In other words, the population density does not change from one time step to the next. Let's set x[n+1] = x[n] and solve for x[n]:\n\nx[n] = 4 * x[n] * (1 - x[n])\n\nNow, let's solve for x[n]:\n\nx[n] - 4 * x[n]^2 = 0\n\nx[n] * (1 - 4 * x[n]) = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n\n1) x[n] = 0\n2) 1 - 4 * x[n] = 0 => x[n] = 1/4\n\nSo, there are two steady-state population densities for the logistic map when r = 4: x[n] = 0 and x[n] = 1/4."
