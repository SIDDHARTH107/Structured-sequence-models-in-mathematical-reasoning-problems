    "message_2": "To show that f is a smooth function, we need to show that all its partial derivatives exist and are continuous on M.\n\nLet's compute the first-order partial derivatives of f with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = -3xz\n∂f/∂z = -3xy\n\nNow let's compute the second-order partial derivatives:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 6x\n∂²f/∂y² = 0\n∂²f/∂z² = 0\n∂²f/∂x∂y = -3z\n∂²f/∂x∂z = -3y\n∂²f/∂y∂z = -3x\n\nAll of these partial derivatives are polynomials in x, y, and z, and therefore they are continuous functions on R^3. Since M is a subset of R^3, these partial derivatives are also continuous on M.\n\nNow, let's check if the partial derivatives satisfy the constraint given by the sphere equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = -3xz\n∂f/∂z = -3xy\n\nNotice that these partial derivatives are also smooth functions, as they are polynomials in x, y, and z. Since the first and second-order partial derivatives exist and are continuous on M, we can conclude that f is a smooth function on M."
