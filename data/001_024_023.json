    "message_2": "Since x is in the second quadrant, sin(x) will be positive. We can use the Pythagorean identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 to find sin(x).\n\ncos²(x) = (2/3)² = 4/9\n\nNow, we can find sin²(x):\n\nsin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1\nsin²(x) + 4/9 = 1\nsin²(x) = 1 - 4/9\nsin²(x) = 5/9\n\nSince sin(x) is positive in the second quadrant, we can take the square root of sin²(x) to find sin(x):\n\nsin(x) = √(5/9)\nsin(x) = √5 / 3\n\nNow we can substitute the values of sin(x) and cos(x) into the given expression:\n\ncos²(x) - sin²(x) = (2/3)² - (√5 / 3)²\n= 4/9 - 5/9\n= -1/9\n\nSo, the simplified trigonometric expression is -1/9."
