    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (2^(Iteration Number / 2))\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10 / 2))\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\nLength = 1 * 32\nLength = 32 units\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is 32 units."
