    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartesian product A × B, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. \n\nA × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y), (3, x), (3, y)}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian product B × A, where we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nB × A = {(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two Cartesian products:\n\nA × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y), (3, x), (3, y)}\nB × A = {(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are not the same. The first elements in the ordered pairs of A × B come from set A, while the first elements in the ordered pairs of B × A come from set B. Therefore, A × B and B × A are not equal."
