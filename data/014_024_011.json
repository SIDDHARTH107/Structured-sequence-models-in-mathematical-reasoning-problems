    "message_1": "What is the key used in a Caesar cipher where the plain text \"HELLO\" is encrypted to \"MJQQT\"?\n(Note: In Caesar cipher, each letter in the plain text is shifted a certain number of positions to create the ciphertext. In this case, the shift is constant for all letters and is called the \"key\".)",
    "message_2": "To find the key used in the Caesar cipher, we can compare the positions of the letters in the plain text and the encrypted text.\n\nLet's take the first letter of the plain text, \"H\", and the first letter of the encrypted text, \"M\". The position of \"H\" in the alphabet is 8, and the position of \"M\" is 13. The difference between these positions is 13 - 8 = 5. This means that the key used in the Caesar cipher is 5, as each letter in the plain text is shifted 5 positions to create the ciphertext."
