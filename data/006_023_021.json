    "message_2": "To find the probability of a customer buying a certain product, we can use the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(Buying | Interested) = P(Buying and Interested) / P(Interested)\n\nWe are given that 60% of the market population is interested in the product, so P(Interested) = 0.60. We are also given that 45% of those interested actually make a purchase, so P(Buying | Interested) = 0.45.\n\nNow we can find the probability of a customer buying the product:\n\nP(Buying and Interested) = P(Buying | Interested) * P(Interested)\nP(Buying and Interested) = 0.45 * 0.60\nP(Buying and Interested) = 0.27\n\nSo, the probability of a customer buying a certain product is 27%."
