    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 8 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of 3, meaning that each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices.\n\nAccording to Brooks' theorem, for any connected graph G with maximum degree Δ(G), the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G), except for complete graphs and odd cycles, where χ(G) = Δ(G) + 1.\n\nSince the graph G has a maximum degree of 3, we know that the chromatic number χ(G) is at most 3, unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\nHowever, a complete graph with 8 vertices would have a degree of 7 for each vertex, and an odd cycle with a degree of 3 for each vertex would require 6 vertices (a 6-cycle). Therefore, G is neither a complete graph nor an odd cycle.\n\nThus, the chromatic number of the graph G is at most 3. Without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine if it can be colored with fewer colors. So, the chromatic number of G is at most 3."
