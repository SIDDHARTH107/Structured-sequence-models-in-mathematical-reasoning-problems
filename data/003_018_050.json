    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = cos(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a function g(h(x)), then the derivative of g with respect to x is g'(h(x)) * h'(x).\n\nIn this case, our function g(x) = cos(x) and h(x) = 2x. \n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x) with respect to x:\n\ng'(x) = -sin(x)\nh'(x) = 2\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\nf'(x) = -sin(2x) * 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = -sin(2(π/4)) * 2\nf'(π/4) = -sin(π/2) * 2\nf'(π/4) = -1 * 2\nf'(π/4) = -2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = cos(2x) at x = π/4 is -2."
