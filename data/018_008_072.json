    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nLet's find A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow let's find B × A:\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that they are not equal. For example, the ordered pair (1, 4) is in A × B but not in B × A, and the ordered pair (4, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative, as A × B ≠ B × A."
