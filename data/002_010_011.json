    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon, you simply multiply the side length by the number of sides. In this case, the side length is 5 cm and there are 6 sides.\n\nPerimeter = Side length × Number of sides\nPerimeter = 5 cm × 6\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the hexagon is 30 cm."
