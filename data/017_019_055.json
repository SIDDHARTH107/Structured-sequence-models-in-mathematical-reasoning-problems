    "message_2": "There are nine non-abelian groups of order 36. They are as follows:\n\n1. G1 = C6 ⋊ C6\n2. G2 = C3 ⋊ C12\n3. G3 = C6 ⋊ C2 × C3\n4. G4 = C3 ⋊ C4 × C3\n5. G5 = C2 × C3 ⋊ C6\n6. G6 = C2 × C3 ⋊ C2 × C3\n7. G7 = (C3 × C3) ⋊ C4\n8. G8 = A4 × C3\n9. G9 = (C3 × C3) ⋊ C2 × C2\n\nHowever, none of these groups are isomorphic to the cyclic group C36, as C36 is an abelian group and all of these groups are non-abelian. \n\nAmong these nine non-abelian groups, only G8 is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3. The isomorphism can be established by the following mapping:\n\nϕ: A4 × C3 → G8\nϕ((a, b)) = a × b\n\nwhere a ∈ A4 and b ∈ C3. This mapping is a bijection and preserves the group operation, so it is an isomorphism between A4 × C3 and G8."
