A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components.\n\nCut vertices:\n1. Vertex A: Removing A and its incident edges disconnects vertex B from the rest of the graph.\n2.

Edge AC: Removing edge AC disconnects vertex D from the rest of the graph.\n2. Edge AB: Removing edge AB disconnects vertex B from the rest of the graph.\n\nThere are 2 bridges in the graph."
