    "message_2": "To prove the statement, we will use the Sylow Theorems. The order of G is 40, which can be factored as 40 = 2^3 * 5^1. Let n_5 denote the number of Sylow-5 subgroups in G.\n\nAccording to the Sylow Theorems:\n\n1. There exists a Sylow-5 subgroup in G, say P, with order 5.\n2. All Sylow-5 subgroups are conjugate to P.\n3. The number of Sylow-5 subgroups, n_5, satisfies the following conditions:\n   a) n_5 divides the order of G, which is 40.\n   b) n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nNow, let's find the divisors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40. We need to find which of these divisors satisfy the condition n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). \n\n1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)\n4 ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n5 ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n8 ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n20 ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n40 ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n\nFrom the list above, only 1 and 8 satisfy the condition n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Therefore, the number of Sylow-5 subgroups in G is either 1 or 8."
