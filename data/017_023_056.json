We will find the Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups (n_2), we have:\n1. n_2 divides 3^2 = 9, so n_2 can be 1, 3, or 9.\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 9.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups (n_3), we have:\n1. n_3 divides 2^3 = 8, so n_3 can be 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow we will consider the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since these subgroups are of coprime orders, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of the Sylow subgroups, which is Z_8 x Z_9 ≅ Z_72. There is 1 group in this class.\n\n2. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1: In this case, there are 9 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup. The group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8) ⋊ Z_9. There are 2 non-isomorphic groups in this class: Z_8 x Z_9 and (Z_2 x Z_4) x Z_9.\n\n3. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and 4 3-Sylow subgroups. The group is a semi-direct product of the form Z_8 ⋊ (Z_9 x Z_9 x Z_9 x Z_9). There are 2 non-isomorphic groups in this class: Z_8 x Z_9 and Z_8 x (Z_3 x Z_3).\n\n4. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4: In this case, there are 9 2-Sylow subgroups and 4 3-Sylow subgroups. The group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_8) ⋊ (Z_9 x Z_9 x Z_9 x Z_9). There are no new non-isomorphic groups in this class.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72. The isomorphism classes are:\n\n1. Z_72 (1 group)\n2. Z_8 x Z_9 (1 group)\n3. (Z_2 x Z_4) x Z_9 (1 group)\n4. Z_8 x (Z_3 x Z_3) (1 group)\n5. Z_8 x Z_9 (1 group)"
