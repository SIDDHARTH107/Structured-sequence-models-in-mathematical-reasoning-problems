    "message_2": "In the given undirected graph:\n\n```\nA --- B --- F          G\n|     |                 |\nC --- D --- E          H\n```\n\nA cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In this graph, the cut vertices are B and D. Removing B will disconnect A, C, and F from D and E, while removing D will disconnect A, B, and C from E.\n\nA bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In this graph, there are two bridges: the edge between B and F, and the edge between D and E. Removing the edge between B and F will disconnect F from the rest of the graph, and removing the edge between D and E will disconnect E from the rest of the graph.\n\nNote that G and H are isolated vertices and do not affect the identification of cut vertices and bridges in the connected component containing A, B, C, D, E, and F."
