    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\nLet's sort the edges by their weights:\n\nEdge 5: 1\nEdge 1: 2\nEdge 3: 3\nEdge 8: 4\nEdge 2: 5\nEdge 6: 6\nEdge 7: 8\nEdge 4: 9\n\nNow, let's build the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add Edge 5 (weight 1) to the minimum spanning tree.\n2. Add Edge 1 (weight 2) to the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add Edge 3 (weight 3) to the minimum spanning tree.\n4. Add Edge 8 (weight 4) to the minimum spanning tree.\n5. Adding Edge 2 (weight 5) would form a cycle, so we skip it.\n6. Add Edge 6 (weight 6) to the minimum spanning tree.\n7. We have now connected all 6 vertices with 5 edges, so we stop adding edges.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm includes the following edges:\n\nEdge 5: 1\nEdge 1: 2\nEdge 3: 3\nEdge 8: 4\nEdge 6: 6\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16."
