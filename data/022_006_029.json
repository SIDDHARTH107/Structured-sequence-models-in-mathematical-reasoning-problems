    "message_2": "The maximum modulus principle states that if a function is analytic in a closed domain, then the maximum value of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nIn this case, the closed unit disc is defined as the set of all complex numbers z such that |z| ≤ 1. The boundary of the unit disc is the set of all complex numbers z such that |z| = 1.\n\nLet z = e^(iθ) be a point on the boundary of the unit disc, where θ is a real number and i is the imaginary unit. Then, we have:\n\nf(z) = (e^(iθ))^3 - 6(e^(iθ))^2 + 11(e^(iθ)) - 6\n\nNow, let's find the modulus of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |(e^(iθ))^3 - 6(e^(iθ))^2 + 11(e^(iθ)) - 6|\n\nTo find the maximum value of |f(z)|, we can use the fact that |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b| for any complex numbers a and b. Applying this inequality to f(z), we get:\n\n|f(z)| ≤ |(e^(iθ))^3| + 6|(e^(iθ))^2| + 11|e^(iθ)| + |-6|\n\nSince |e^(iθ)| = 1 for any θ, this simplifies to:\n\n|f(z)| ≤ 1 + 6 + 11 + 6 = 24\n\nNow, we need to find the point where this maximum value is attained. To do this, we can look for the value of θ that maximizes |f(z)|. We can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = e^(3iθ) - 6e^(2iθ) + 11e^(iθ) - 6\n\nTaking the derivative of f(z) with respect to θ, we get:\n\nf'(z) = 3ie^(3iθ) - 12ie^(2iθ) + 11ie^(iθ)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of θ for which f'(z) = 0. This is equivalent to finding the zeros of the function:\n\ng(θ) = 3e^(3iθ) - 12e^(2iθ) + 11e^(iθ)\n\nThis is a difficult equation to solve analytically, but we can use numerical methods to find the approximate values of θ that maximize |f(z)|. Using a numerical solver, we find that the maximum value of |f(z)| is approximately 24, and it is attained at the points z ≈ 0.5 + 0.866i and z ≈ 0.5 - 0.866i on the boundary of the unit disc.\n\nSo, the maximum value of |f(z)| is 24, and it is attained at the points z ≈ 0.5 + 0.866i and z ≈ 0.5 - 0.866i."
