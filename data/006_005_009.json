    "message_1": "A car dealership sells an average of 30 cars per week. What is the probability that they will sell 40 or more cars in a given week, assuming that the number of cars sold per week follows a normal distribution with a mean of 30 and a standard deviation of 8?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selling 40 or more cars in a given week, we need to calculate the z-score and then find the area under the normal distribution curve to the right of that z-score.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (40 cars), μ is the mean (30 cars), and σ is the standard deviation (8 cars).\n\nz = (40 - 30) / 8\nz = 10 / 8\nz = 1.25\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve to the right of z = 1.25. We can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the area to the left of z = 1.25 and then subtract it from 1 to find the area to the right.\n\nP(Z > 1.25) = 1 - P(Z < 1.25)\n\nUsing a z-table or an online calculator, we find that P(Z < 1.25) ≈ 0.8944.\n\nP(Z > 1.25) = 1 - 0.8944\nP(Z > 1.25) ≈ 0.1056\n\nSo, the probability that the car dealership will sell 40 or more cars in a given week is approximately 10.56%."
