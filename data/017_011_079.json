    "message_2": "To prove that there are no non-isomorphic groups of order 12 other than cyclic group C12, alternating group A4, or dihedral group D6, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 12. Then, the order of G is 2^2 * 3^1.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 4) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, there can be either 1 or 3 such subgroups. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 3) must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, there can be either 1 or 4 such subgroups.\n\nCase 1: There is only one 2-Sylow subgroup P and one 3-Sylow subgroup Q.\nIn this case, both P and Q are normal in G (since they are the unique subgroups of their respective orders). Then, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, which means G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12.\n\nCase 2: There is only one 2-Sylow subgroup P and four 3-Sylow subgroups.\nIn this case, P is normal in G. Let Q be one of the 3-Sylow subgroups. Then, |P ∩ Q| = 1, since their orders are coprime. Thus, |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 12, so PQ = G. Since P is normal in G, G is a semidirect product of P and Q. The only nontrivial automorphism of Q is the inversion map, which has order 2. Therefore, there are only two possible semidirect products: the direct product (which is the cyclic group C12) and the dihedral group D6.\n\nCase 3: There are three 2-Sylow subgroups and one 3-Sylow subgroup Q.\nIn this case, Q is normal in G. Let P be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups. Then, |P ∩ Q| = 1, since their orders are coprime. Thus, |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 12, so PQ = G. Since Q is normal in G, G is a semidirect product of P and Q. The automorphism group of P is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3, which has three elements of order 3. Thus, there are three possible semidirect products, but they are all isomorphic to the alternating group A4.\n\nIn conclusion, there are no non-isomorphic groups of order 12 other than the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, and the dihedral group D6."
