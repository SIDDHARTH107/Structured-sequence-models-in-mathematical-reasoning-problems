    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series expansion of the function $f(x) = x^2$ over the interval $-\\pi \\leq x \\leq \\pi$, we first need to find the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is given by:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} [a_n \\cos(nx) + b_n \\sin(nx)]$$\n\nFor the given function, we have:\n$$f(x) = x^2$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$, we use the following formulas:\n\n$$a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) dx$$\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\cos(nx) dx$$\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(nx) dx$$\n\nFirst, let's find $a_0$:\n$$a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x^2 dx = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} = \\frac{1}{3}(\\pi^2 - (-\\pi)^2) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi^2$$\n\nNow, let's find $a_n$:\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x^2 \\cos(nx) dx$$\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\nLet $u = x^2$ and $dv = \\cos(nx) dx$. Then, $du = 2x dx$ and $v = \\frac{1}{n}\\sin(nx)$.\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[\\frac{x^2}{n}\\sin(nx)\\right]_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} - \\frac{2}{\\pi n} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x \\sin(nx) dx$$\nThe first term evaluates to zero since $\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$ for all integer values of $n$. Now we need to solve the second integral. Again, we can use integration by parts:\nLet $u = x$ and $dv = \\sin(nx) dx$. Then, $du = dx$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{n}\\cos(nx)$.\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n$$a_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi n^2} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos(nx) dx - \\frac{2}{\\pi n^2} \\left[-x\\cos(nx)\\right]_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}$$\nThe first term evaluates to zero since the integral of $\\cos(nx)$ over a full period is zero. The second term also evaluates to zero since $\\cos(n\\pi) = (-1)^n$ and $(-1)^n - (-1)^n = 0$. Therefore, $a_n = 0$ for all $n$.\n\nNow, let's find $b_n$:\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x^2 \\sin(nx) dx$$\nSince $f(x)$ is an even function and $\\sin(nx)$ is an odd function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, $b_n = 0$ for all $n$.\n\nSo, the Fourier series expansion of $f(x) = x^2$ is:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}$$\n\nNow, let's use the Fourier series to solve the partial differential equation (PDE):\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$$\nsubject to the initial condition $u(x,0) = f(x)$ and the boundary conditions $u(-\\pi, t) = u(\\pi, t)$.\n\nSince the Fourier series expansion of $f(x)$ is a constant, the solution to the PDE is independent of $x$. Therefore, the solution is of the form:\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} + C(t)$$\n\nApplying the initial condition $u(x,0) = f(x)$, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\pi^2}{3} + C(0) = x^2$$\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we have $C(0) = 0$. Therefore, the solution to the PDE is:\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}$$"
