    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A x (B ∩ {3,4}).",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of B and {3,4}. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, B ∩ {3,4} = {3,4} since both 3 and 4 are present in set B.\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of A x (B ∩ {3,4}). The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nSo, A x (B ∩ {3,4}) = A x {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nThe Cartesian product of A x (B ∩ {3,4}) is {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)}."
