    "message_2": "First, we will prove that H and K are unique. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) in G must divide 6 (since 30 = 5 * 6) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which means H is unique. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (subgroups of order 3) in G must divide 10 (since 30 = 3 * 10) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, which means K is unique.\n\nNow we will prove that the product HK is a subgroup of G. Since H and K are unique, they are both normal subgroups of G. Let h1, h2 ∈ H and k1, k2 ∈ K. Then, (h1k1)(h2k2) = h1(k1h2)k2, and since K is normal in G, k1h2 = h3k3 for some h3 ∈ H and k3 ∈ K. Thus, (h1k1)(h2k2) = h1h3k3k2 ∈ HK. Since the product of any two elements in HK is also in HK, HK is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow we will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30. Since |H| = 5 and |K| = 3, and 5 and 3 are prime numbers, H and K are both cyclic groups. Let H = ⟨h⟩ and K = ⟨k⟩. Since |H ∩ K| = 1 (as H and K are unique), we have |HK| = |H||K| = 15. Thus, |G : HK| = 2, which means that HK is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nConsider the group G/HK. Since |G/HK| = 2, G/HK is a cyclic group of order 2, generated by some element gHK. Then, g^2 ∈ HK, which means g^2 = hk for some h ∈ H and k ∈ K. Since H and K are normal in G, we have ghg^(-1) ∈ H and kg^(-1) ∈ K. Thus, g^2 = ghg^(-1) * kg^(-1), which implies that g^2 commutes with both h and k.\n\nNow, we have three possibilities:\n\n1. G is abelian: In this case, G is a direct product of H and K, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n\n2. G is non-abelian, and g^2 ≠ e: In this case, G is generated by h, k, and g, with the relations h^5 = k^3 = g^2 = e, and gh = hg^(-1)k. This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\n3. G is non-abelian, and g^2 = e: In this case, G is generated by h, k, and g, with the relations h^5 = k^3 = g^2 = e, and gh = hg^(-1)k. This group is a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
