They have collected the following data for 10 students:\n\n| Hours Studied | Exam Grade |\n|--------------|------------|\n| 3            | 65         |\n| 7            | 85         |\n| 2            | 60         |\n| 5            | 75         |\n| 8            | 90         |\n| 6            | 80         |\n| 1            | 55         |\n| 4            | 70         |\n| 9            | 92         |\n| 10           | 95         |\n\nUsing correlation analysis, the student needs to find the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the exam grades.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the number of hours studied and the exam grades, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere x represents the hours studied, y represents the exam grades, x̄ is the mean of hours studied, and ȳ is the mean of exam grades.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of hours studied (x̄) and the mean of exam grades (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (3 + 7 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 10) / 10 = 55 / 10 = 5.5\nȳ = (65 + 85 + 60 + 75 + 90 + 80 + 55 + 70 + 92 + 95) / 10 = 767 / 10 = 76.7\n\nNext, we will calculate the individual terms (x - x̄), (y - ȳ), (x - x̄)(y - ȳ), (x - x̄)², and (y - ȳ)² for each data point:\n\n| Hours Studied (x) | Exam Grade (y) | x - x̄ | y - ȳ | (x - x̄)(y - ȳ) | (x - x̄)² | (y - ȳ)² |\n|-------------------|----------------|-------|-------|---------------|---------|---------|\n| 3                 | 65             | -2.5  | -11.7 | 29.25          | 6.25    | 136.89  |\n| 7                 | 85             | 1.5   | 8.3   | 12.45          | 2.25    | 68.89   |\n| 2                 | 60             | -3.5  | -16.7 | 58.45          | 12.25   | 278.89  |\n| 5                 | 75             | -0.5  | -1.7  | 0.85           | 0.25    | 2.89    |\n| 8                 | 90             | 2.5   | 13.3  | 33.25          | 6.25    | 176.89  |\n| 6                 | 80             | 0.5   | 3.3   | 1.65           | 0.25    | 10.89   |\n| 1                 | 55             | -4.5  | -21.7 | 97.65          | 20.25   | 470.89  |\n| 4                 | 70             | -1.5  | -6.7  | 10.05          | 2.25    | 44.89   |\n| 9                 | 92             | 3.5   | 15.3  | 53.55          | 12.25   | 234.09  |\n| 10                | 95             | 4.5   | 18.3  | 82.35          | 20.25   | 334.89  |\n\nNow, we will sum up the columns (x - x̄)(y - ȳ), (x - x̄)², and (y - ȳ)²:\n\nΣ(x - x̄)(y - ȳ) = 29.25 + 12.45 + 58.45 + 0.85 + 33.25 + 1.65 + 97.65 + 10.05 + 53.55 + 82.35 = 379.5\nΣ(x - x̄)² = 6.25 + 2.25 + 12.25 + 0.25 + 6.25 + 0.25 + 20.25 + 2.25 + 12.25 + 20.25 = 82.5\nΣ(y - ȳ)² = 136.89 + 68.89 + 278.89 + 2.89 + 176.89 + 10.89 + 470.89 + 44.89 + 234.09 + 334.89 = 1959.1\n\nFinally, we will plug these values into the correlation coefficient formula:\n\nr = 379.5 / √(82.5 * 1959.1) ≈ 379.5 / √161467.75 ≈ 379.5 / 401.83 ≈ 0.944\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) between the number of hours studied and the exam grades is approximately 0.944, which indicates a strong positive correlation."
