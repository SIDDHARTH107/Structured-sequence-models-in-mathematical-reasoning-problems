    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x(2-x) on the interval [0, 2], we first need to determine the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is defined on a finite interval, we will use the formula for the Fourier series on a finite interval:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval (in this case, L = 1), and the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to 2L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to 2L\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/1) * ∫[x(2-x) * cos(0) dx] from 0 to 2\na_0 = ∫[x(2-x) dx] from 0 to 2\na_0 = ∫[2x - x^2 dx] from 0 to 2\na_0 = [x^2 - (1/3)x^3] from 0 to 2\na_0 = (4 - (8/3)) - (0) = 4/3\n\nNow, let's find a_n for n ≥ 1:\n\na_n = (1/1) * ∫[x(2-x) * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\na_n = ∫[2x * cos(nπx) - x^2 * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nFor the first term, let u = 2x and dv = cos(nπx) dx:\ndu = 2 dx\nv = (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)\n\nFor the second term, let u = x^2 and dv = cos(nπx) dx:\ndu = 2x dx\nv = (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\na_n = [2x * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - ∫(1/nπ) * sin(nπx) * 2 dx] - [x^2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - ∫(1/nπ) * sin(nπx) * 2x dx] from 0 to 2\na_n = [2x * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - (2/nπ) * ∫sin(nπx) dx] - [x^2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - (2x/nπ) * ∫sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\na_n = [2x * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) + (2/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx)] - [x^2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) + (2x/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx)] from 0 to 2\na_n = [(2/nπ) * (2x - x^2) * sin(nπx) + (2/n^2π^2) * (2x - x^2) * cos(nπx)] from 0 to 2\na_n = (2/nπ) * (4 - 4nπ) - (2/n^2π^2) * (4 - 4n^2π^2) = (8/nπ) - (4nπ) - (8/n^2π^2) + (8n^2π^2)\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[x(2-x) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\nb_n = ∫[2x * sin(nπx) - x^2 * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nAgain, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nFor the first term, let u = 2x and dv = sin(nπx) dx:\ndu = 2 dx\nv = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nFor the second term, let u = x^2 and dv = sin(nπx) dx:\ndu = 2x dx\nv = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\nb_n = [2x * -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx) - ∫-(1/nπ) * cos(nπx) * 2 dx] - [x^2 * -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx) - ∫-(1/nπ) * cos(nπx) * 2x dx] from 0 to 2\nb_n = [-2x * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx) + (2/nπ) * ∫cos(nπx) dx] - [-x^2 * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx) + (2x/nπ) * ∫cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\nb_n = [-2x * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx) - (2/n^2π^2) * sin(nπx)] - [-x^2 * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx) - (2x/n^2π^2) * sin(nπx)] from 0 to 2\nb_n = [-(2/nπ) * (2x - x^2) * cos(nπx) - (2/n^2π^2) * (2x - x^2) * sin(nπx)] from 0 to 2\nb_n = -(2/nπ) * (4 - 4nπ) + (2/n^2π^2) * (4 - 4n^2π^2) = -(8/nπ) + 4nπ + (8/n^2π^2) - 8n^2π^2\n\nFinally, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x(2-x) on the interval [0, 2]:\n\nf(x) = (4/3)/2 + Σ[((8/nπ) - (4nπ) - (8/n^2π^2) + (8n^2π^2)) * cos(nπx) + (-(8/nπ) + 4nπ + (8/n^2π^2) - 8n^2π^2) * sin(nπx)]"
