    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 468 and 156 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (468) by the smaller number (156) and find the remainder.\n   468 รท 156 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (156) and the smaller number with the remainder (0).\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0.\n\nSince the remainder is already 0 in the first step, we don't need to repeat the process. The GCD of 468 and 156 is the smaller number in the last step, which is 156."
