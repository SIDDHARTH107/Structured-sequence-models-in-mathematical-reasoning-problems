    "message_1": "A company that manufactures light bulbs produces a batch of 50,000 bulbs. The mean lifespan of the bulbs is 1200 hours with a standard deviation of 150 hours. However, some bulbs in the batch are defective and have much shorter lifespans. Using robust statistics, what is the median lifespan of the bulbs in the batch?",
    "message_2": "To find the median lifespan of the bulbs in the batch using robust statistics, we need to have the data of the lifespans of all 50,000 bulbs. Since we are not provided with the actual data, we cannot directly calculate the median lifespan.\n\nHowever, we can provide some insight into how the presence of defective bulbs might affect the median lifespan. If the defective bulbs have significantly shorter lifespans, they will likely pull the median lifespan down compared to the mean lifespan of 1200 hours. The median is less sensitive to extreme values (outliers) than the mean, so it would be a more accurate representation of the central tendency of the data in this case.\n\nIn summary, without the actual data, we cannot calculate the median lifespan of the bulbs in the batch. However, we can expect that the median lifespan would be lower than the mean lifespan of 1200 hours due to the presence of defective bulbs with shorter lifespans."
