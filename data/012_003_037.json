    "message_2": "To find the maximum independent set in the graph, we can use a greedy algorithm. We will iteratively select vertices that are not adjacent to any previously selected vertex and remove their neighbors from the graph.\n\n1. Select vertex 1 (the first vertex). The remaining vertices are {2, 4, 5}.\n2. Select vertex 2. The remaining vertices are {5}.\n3. Select vertex 5. There are no remaining vertices.\n\nThe maximum independent set has a size of 3, and one possible set is {1, 2, 5}. Note that there may be other independent sets of the same size, such as {1, 3, 6} or {3, 4, 7}."
