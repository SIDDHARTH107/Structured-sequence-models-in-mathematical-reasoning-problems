    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x + 2) / (2x^3 - 1) using the quotient rule, we first need to identify the numerator function (u) and the denominator function (v). In this case, u(x) = 3x^2 + 5x + 2 and v(x) = 2x^3 - 1.\n\nThe quotient rule states that the derivative of a function f(x) = u(x) / v(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(3x^2 + 5x + 2)/dx = 6x + 5\nv'(x) = d(2x^3 - 1)/dx = 6x^2\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = ((6x + 5)(2x^3 - 1) - (3x^2 + 5x + 2)(6x^2)) / (2x^3 - 1)^2\n\nf'(x) = (12x^4 - 6x + 10x^3 - 5 - 18x^4 - 30x^3 - 12x^2) / (4x^6 - 4x^3 + 1)\n\nf'(x) = (-6x^4 - 20x^3 + 6x^2 - 6x - 5) / (4x^6 - 4x^3 + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x + 2) / (2x^3 - 1) is:\n\nf'(x) = (-6x^4 - 20x^3 + 6x^2 - 6x - 5) / (4x^6 - 4x^3 + 1)"
