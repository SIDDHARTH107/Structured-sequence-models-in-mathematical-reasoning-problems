The maximum height reached by the rocket is 90 meters and the minimum height is 70 meters. Find the phase shift of the trigonometric function that models this vertical oscillation. Express your answer in radians.",
    "message_2": "To model the vertical oscillation of the rocket, we can use a sinusoidal function of the form:\n\ny(t) = A * sin(B * (t - C)) + D\n\nwhere y(t) represents the height of the rocket at time t, A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nWe are given the maximum height (90 meters) and the minimum height (70 meters). The average of these two values will give us the vertical shift, D:\n\nD = (90 + 70) / 2 = 160 / 2 = 80 meters\n\nThe amplitude, A, is half the difference between the maximum and minimum heights:\n\nA = (90 - 70) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 meters\n\nNow we need to find the phase shift, C. Since the rocket starts at a height of 80 meters (the vertical shift), it is at the midpoint of its oscillation. This means that the sine function should be at its zero point. There are two possible cases:\n\n1) The sine function starts at its zero point and goes up (positive slope). In this case, the phase shift is 0 radians.\n\n2) The sine function starts at its zero point and goes down (negative slope). In this case, the phase shift is Ï€ radians.\n\nTo determine which case we are in, we can look at the maximum and minimum heights. Since the maximum height (90 meters) is reached before the minimum height (70 meters), the rocket must be going up initially. Therefore, the phase shift is 0 radians."
