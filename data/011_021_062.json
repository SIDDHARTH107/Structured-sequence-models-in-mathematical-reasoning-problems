    "message_1": "A traveling salesman wants to visit 5 cities in a specific order. The distance between the cities are as follows - City 1 to City 2: 10 km, City 1 to City 3: 15 km, City 1 to City 4: 20 km, City 1 to City 5: 25 km, City 2 to City 3: 12 km, City 2 to City 4: 18 km, City 2 to City 5: 24 km, City 3 to City 4: 8 km, City 3 to City 5: 16 km, and City 4 to City 5: 10 km. What is the shortest possible distance that the traveling salesman can cover to visit all 5 cities in the given order?",
    "message_2": "Since the salesman needs to visit the cities in a specific order, we can simply add the distances between the cities in that order to find the shortest possible distance.\n\nThe order is: City 1 → City 2 → City 3 → City 4 → City 5\n\nThe distances are: 10 km (City 1 to City 2) + 12 km (City 2 to City 3) + 8 km (City 3 to City 4) + 10 km (City 4 to City 5)\n\nThe shortest possible distance is: 10 km + 12 km + 8 km + 10 km = 40 km"
