    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the point corresponding to the maximal ideal $(x-1, y+2)$, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both the ideal $(x-1, y+2)$ and the equation of the affine variety $x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ideal $(x-1, y+2)$. This ideal is generated by the polynomials $x-1$ and $y+2$. Therefore, the point we are looking for must satisfy the following equations:\n\n1. $x - 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1$\n2. $y + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = -2$\n\nNow, we need to check if this point $(1, -2)$ satisfies the equation of the affine variety $x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$. Plugging in the values of $x$ and $y$, we get:\n\n$(1)^2 + (-2)^2 - 1 = 1 + 4 - 1 = 4 \\neq 0$\n\nSince the point $(1, -2)$ does not satisfy the equation of the affine variety, there is no point on the variety corresponding to the maximal ideal $(x-1, y+2)$. This is because the ideal $(x-1, y+2)$ is not a maximal ideal in the ring $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2+y^2-1)$."
