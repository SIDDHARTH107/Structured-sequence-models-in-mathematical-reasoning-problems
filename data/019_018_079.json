    "message_2": "There is no definitive answer to the number of possible proofs for the statement \"P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P\" using the rules of natural deduction in propositional logic, as the number of proofs can vary depending on the specific set of rules and axioms used in a given system. However, I can provide one simple proof using the rules of natural deduction.\n\n1. Assume P ∨ Q (Assumption)\n2. If P, then Q ∨ P (Introduction of ∨, by adding Q to P)\n3. If Q, then Q ∨ P (Introduction of ∨, by adding P to Q)\n4. Q ∨ P (Elimination of ∨, from 1, 2, and 3)\n5. P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P (Introduction of →, from the assumption in step 1 to the conclusion in step 4)\n\nThis proof demonstrates that the statement \"P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P\" is valid using the rules of natural deduction in propositional logic. There may be other proofs depending on the specific set of rules and axioms used, but this is one straightforward example."
