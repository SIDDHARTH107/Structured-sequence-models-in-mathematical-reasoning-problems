If they produce 53 items in total, what is the smallest number of batches produced to achieve this?\"\n\nNote: The answer to this problem involves using Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies certain modular congruences.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of batches produced. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The factory produces items in batches of 3, 4, and 5.\n2. They produce 53 items in total.\n\nWe can represent this information using modular congruences:\n\nx ≡ a (mod 3)\nx ≡ b (mod 4)\nx ≡ c (mod 5)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the number of items produced in each batch of 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\nSince the factory produces 53 items in total, we have:\n\na + 3k1 = b + 4k2 = c + 5k3 = 53\n\nwhere k1, k2, and k3 are integers.\n\nNow we can rewrite the modular congruences using the information above:\n\nx ≡ 53 - 3k1 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 53 - 4k2 (mod 4)\nx ≡ 53 - 5k3 (mod 5)\n\nWe can now solve these congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. First, let's find the smallest non-negative integer solutions for each congruence:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 1 (mod 4)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n\nNow, let's apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n\nM = 3 * 4 * 5 = 60\nM1 = M/3 = 20\nM2 = M/4 = 15\nM3 = M/5 = 12\n\nNow we need to find the inverse of each Mi modulo the respective moduli:\n\ny1 ≡ M1^(-1) (mod 3) => 20y1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => y1 ≡ 2 (mod 3)\ny2 ≡ M2^(-1) (mod 4) => 15y2 ≡ 1 (mod 4) => y2 ≡ 3 (mod 4)\ny3 ≡ M3^(-1) (mod 5) => 12y3 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => y3 ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n\nNow we can find the solution for x:\n\nx = (2 * 20 * 2) + (1 * 15 * 3) + (3 * 12 * 3) = 80 + 45 + 108 = 233\n\nHowever, we need the smallest non-negative integer solution, so we take x modulo M:\n\nx ≡ 233 (mod 60) => x ≡ 53 (mod 60)\n\nSo, the smallest number of batches produced to achieve 53 items is 53."
