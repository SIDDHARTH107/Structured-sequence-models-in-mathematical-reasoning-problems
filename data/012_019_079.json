    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. This is also known as edge coloring.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree (Δ) of the graph. Since there are 5 vertices and 7 edges, the maximum degree cannot be more than 4 (as a complete graph with 5 vertices, K5, has 10 edges). However, since there are 7 edges, at least one vertex must have a degree of 4. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ = 4.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either equal to the maximum degree Δ or Δ + 1, i.e., χ'(G) ∈ {Δ, Δ + 1}.\n\nIn this case, since Δ = 4, the chromatic index χ'(G) is either 4 or 5. To determine which one it is, we need to analyze the graph structure.\n\nCase 1: χ'(G) = 4\nIf the chromatic index is 4, then we can color the edges of the graph using 4 colors such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. This would mean that the graph is a subgraph of the complete graph K5, which has 10 edges. However, since our graph has only 7 edges, it is not a complete graph, and it is possible that we cannot color the edges using only 4 colors.\n\nCase 2: χ'(G) = 5\nIf the chromatic index is 5, then we need 5 colors to properly color the edges of the graph. This can happen if there is a vertex with degree 4, and all its adjacent edges require different colors. Since we know that there is at least one vertex with degree 4, this case is possible.\n\nTherefore, considering the two cases, the chromatic index of the given graph is χ'(G) = 5."
