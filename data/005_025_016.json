    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people who prefer coffee over tea, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion:\n\nCI = p ± Z * √(p(1-p)/n)\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- p is the sample proportion (350/500)\n- Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\n- n is the sample size (500)\n\nFirst, let's find the sample proportion (p):\n\np = 350/500 = 0.7\n\nNow, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nSE = √(p(1-p)/n) = √(0.7 * 0.3 / 500) ≈ 0.0206\n\nFinally, let's find the confidence interval:\n\nCI = p ± Z * SE = 0.7 ± 1.96 * 0.0206\nCI = 0.7 ± 0.0404\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people in the population who prefer coffee over tea is approximately (0.6596, 0.7404)."
