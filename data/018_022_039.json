    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, then calculate the symmetric difference of A and B. Next, find the Cartesian product of B and A and calculate the symmetric difference of B and A. Show that the two symmetric differences are not equal, and hence prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. This is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A.\n\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric differences are not equal with respect to the Cartesian product. To do this, we will find the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences:\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = (B Δ A) x (A Δ B), which means that the symmetric differences are equal with respect to the Cartesian product. This contradicts the original statement that they are not equal. Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
