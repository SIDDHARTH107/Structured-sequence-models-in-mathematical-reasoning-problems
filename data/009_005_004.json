    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the equation for the current in an RLC circuit. The equation for the current in an RLC circuit is given by:\n\ni(t) = V0/R * (1 - e^(-R*t/(2*L))) * sin(sqrt(1/(L*C) - (R/(2*L))^2) * t)\n\nwhere:\ni(t) is the current at time t\nV0 is the initial voltage across the capacitor\nR is the resistance (10 ohms)\nL is the inductance (0.5 H)\nC is the capacitance (50 microfarads = 50 * 10^-6 F)\nt is the time (0.02 seconds)\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial voltage across the capacitor (V0). We can do this using the formula:\n\nV0 = Q0/C\n\nwhere:\nQ0 is the initial charge on the capacitor (100 microcoulombs = 100 * 10^-6 C)\n\nV0 = (100 * 10^-6) / (50 * 10^-6) = 2 V\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation for the current:\n\ni(0.02) = 2/10 * (1 - e^(-10*0.02/(2*0.5))) * sin(sqrt(1/(0.5*50*10^-6) - (10/(2*0.5))^2) * 0.02)\n\ni(0.02) = 0.2 * (1 - e^(-0.2)) * sin(sqrt(1/(0.5*50*10^-6) - 2.5^2) * 0.02)\n\ni(0.02) = 0.2 * (1 - e^(-0.2)) * sin(sqrt(1/(0.5*50*10^-6) - 6.25) * 0.02)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value inside the square root:\n\n1/(0.5*50*10^-6) - 6.25 = 4000 - 6.25 = 3993.75\n\nNow, let's calculate the value inside the sine function:\n\nsqrt(3993.75) * 0.02 = 12.632 * 0.02 = 0.25264\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the exponential function:\n\ne^(-0.2) = 0.81873\n\nNow, let's calculate the current at t = 0.02 seconds:\n\ni(0.02) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.81873) * sin(0.25264)\ni(0.02) = 0.2 * 0.18127 * sin(0.25264)\ni(0.02) = 0.036254 * 0.24956\ni(0.02) â‰ˆ 0.00905 A\n\nSo, the current in the circuit at time t = 0.02 seconds is approximately 0.00905 A."
