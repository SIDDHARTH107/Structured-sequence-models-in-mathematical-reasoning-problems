    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a nonlinear delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = αx(t-τ) / (1 + x(t-τ)^γ) - βx(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the variable of interest, τ is the delay time, α, β, and γ are parameters, and t is time.\n\nTo find the first positive Lyapunov exponent, we need to linearize the Mackey-Glass equation around a fixed point and then analyze the stability of the linearized system. However, calculating the Lyapunov exponent for a delay differential equation is not a straightforward process and typically requires numerical methods or simulations.\n\nThere is no direct formula to compute the first positive Lyapunov exponent for the Mackey-Glass equation with given parameter values. Instead, one would have to use numerical methods, such as the Wolf algorithm or Rosenstein's method, to approximate the Lyapunov exponent.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to provide an exact numerical value for the first positive Lyapunov exponent for the given parameters without performing a numerical analysis."
