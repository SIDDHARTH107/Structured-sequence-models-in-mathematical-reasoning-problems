    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth, we can use the following inequality:\n\ng ≤ 2 * m / (n - g + 1)\n\nwhere g is the girth, m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn our case, we have n = 10 vertices and m = 15 edges. Let's find the smallest possible girth g.\n\nFor g = 3 (a triangle):\n3 ≤ 2 * 15 / (10 - 3 + 1)\n3 ≤ 30 / 8\n3 ≤ 3.75\n\nThe inequality holds, so the graph can have a girth of 3. Since 3 is the smallest possible cycle in a graph, the girth of the graph is 3."
