    "message_1": "Consider a compact oriented surface $M$ of genus $g$. Let $S_1, S_2, S_3$ be three closed oriented surfaces of genus $1$ embedded in $M$, such that $S_1$ intersects $S_2$ transversely in one point, $S_2$ intersects $S_3$ transversely in one point, and $S_3$ intersects $S_1$ transversely in one point. \n\nWhat is the value of the triple intersection number $(S_1 \\cdot S_2 \\cdot S_3)$ in $M$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the triple intersection number $(S_1 \\cdot S_2 \\cdot S_3)$, we will use the fact that the intersection number is a homotopy invariant and is skew-symmetric. \n\nFirst, let's homotope $S_1$ and $S_2$ so that they intersect transversely in a small neighborhood of their intersection point. Then, we can homotope $S_3$ so that it intersects $S_1$ and $S_2$ transversely in small neighborhoods of their respective intersection points. Now, we have a well-defined triple intersection number $(S_1 \\cdot S_2 \\cdot S_3)$.\n\nSince the intersection number is skew-symmetric, we have $(S_1 \\cdot S_2) = -(S_2 \\cdot S_1)$. Similarly, we have $(S_2 \\cdot S_3) = -(S_3 \\cdot S_2)$ and $(S_3 \\cdot S_1) = -(S_1 \\cdot S_3)$. \n\nNow, consider the sum $(S_1 \\cdot S_2) + (S_2 \\cdot S_3) + (S_3 \\cdot S_1)$. By skew-symmetry, this sum is equal to $-(S_2 \\cdot S_1) - (S_3 \\cdot S_2) - (S_1 \\cdot S_3)$. However, since the intersection number is a homotopy invariant, this sum is also equal to $(S_1 \\cdot S_2 \\cdot S_3)$. \n\nTherefore, we have $(S_1 \\cdot S_2 \\cdot S_3) = -(S_2 \\cdot S_1) - (S_3 \\cdot S_2) - (S_1 \\cdot S_3)$. Since each pair of surfaces intersects transversely in one point, we have $(S_1 \\cdot S_2) = (S_2 \\cdot S_3) = (S_3 \\cdot S_1) = 1$. \n\nSubstituting these values into the equation above, we get $(S_1 \\cdot S_2 \\cdot S_3) = -1 - 1 - 1 = -3$. \n\nSo, the triple intersection number $(S_1 \\cdot S_2 \\cdot S_3)$ in $M$ is $-3$."
