    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(4x - 1) = 2, we can use the property of logarithms that states:\n\nlog_a(b) = c is equivalent to a^c = b\n\nIn this case, the base of the logarithm is 10 (since it is not specified), so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n10^2 = 4x - 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n100 = 4x - 1\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n101 = 4x\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nx = 101/4\n\nSo, x = 25.25."
