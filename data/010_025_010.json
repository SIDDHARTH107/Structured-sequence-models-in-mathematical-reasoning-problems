    "message_2": "For a closed orientable surface with genus g, the dimension of the Hilbert space for the topological quantum field theory (TQFT) associated with this surface can be computed using the formula:\n\ndim(H) = d^(2g)\n\nHere, d is the dimension of the vector space associated with each handle of the surface, and g is the genus of the surface.\n\nIn the case of the Chern-Simons TQFT, for example, d is the number of irreducible representations of the gauge group (e.g., the number of primary fields in the associated conformal field theory). For other TQFTs, d may have a different interpretation, but the formula for the dimension of the Hilbert space remains the same."
