    "message_1": "Here's a mixed-integer programming problem for the student to solve:\n\nA company wants to design a new product that can be made from two types of raw materials â€“ material A and material B. The cost per unit of material A is $8, and the cost per unit of material B is $12. The company wants to minimize the cost of producing the new product subject to the following constraints:\n\n- The new product requires at least 20 units of material A and at least 10 units of material B.\n- The total weight of the new product cannot exceed 100 units.\n- The company cannot purchase more than 30 units of material A and 20 units of material B due to budget constraints.\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of producing the new product and how many units of each material should the company purchase to achieve this cost?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of material A and y be the number of units of material B. The objective function to minimize is the total cost:\n\nC = 8x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x >= 20 (at least 20 units of material A)\n2. y >= 10 (at least 10 units of material B)\n3. x + y <= 100 (total weight cannot exceed 100 units)\n4. x <= 30 (cannot purchase more than 30 units of material A)\n5. y <= 20 (cannot purchase more than 20 units of material B)\n\nTo find the minimum cost, we can analyze the feasible region determined by the constraints and evaluate the objective function at the vertices of this region.\n\nVertices of the feasible region:\n(20, 10), (20, 20), (30, 10), (30, 20)\n\nEvaluating the objective function at these vertices:\n\nC(20, 10) = 8(20) + 12(10) = 160 + 120 = 280\nC(20, 20) = 8(20) + 12(20) = 160 + 240 = 400\nC(30, 10) = 8(30) + 12(10) = 240 + 120 = 360\nC(30, 20) = 8(30) + 12(20) = 240 + 240 = 480\n\nThe minimum cost is $280, which occurs when the company purchases 20 units of material A and 10 units of material B."
