    "message_2": "The clique number of the given graph is 3. \n\nThis can be determined by identifying the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. In this case, the largest clique is formed by the vertices A, C, and D, which are all connected to each other. No other set of 4 or more vertices in the graph are all connected to each other, so the clique number is 3."
