    "message_1": "Suppose you have a message with a hash value of \"23FD10A67B\" and a private key of \"67C8A951\". Using the RSA digital signature algorithm, what is the value of the corresponding digital signature for the message?",
    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature using the RSA algorithm, we need more information than just the hash value and the private key. Specifically, we need the modulus (n) used in the RSA algorithm. The modulus is a part of the public key and is used to perform the encryption and decryption operations.\n\nThe RSA digital signature algorithm involves the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the hash value of the message (already given as \"23FD10A67B\").\n2. Convert the hash value to an integer (let's call it H).\n3. Use the private key (d) and modulus (n) to compute the digital signature (S) using the formula: S â‰¡ H^d (mod n).\n\nWithout the modulus (n), we cannot compute the digital signature. Please provide the modulus value, and we can proceed with the calculation."
