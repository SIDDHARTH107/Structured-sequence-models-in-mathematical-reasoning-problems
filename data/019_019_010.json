    "message_2": "The minimum number of states required to construct a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that accepts the language of all strings over the alphabet {0,1} with an even number of 1's is 2. \n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nWe can represent the DFA with two states: q0 and q1. \n\n- q0 is the initial state and also an accepting state, representing an even number of 1's.\n- q1 is a non-accepting state, representing an odd number of 1's.\n\nThe transition function can be defined as follows:\n\n- δ(q0, 0) = q0 (If we are in state q0 and read a 0, we stay in q0 because the number of 1's remains even.)\n- δ(q0, 1) = q1 (If we are in state q0 and read a 1, we move to q1 because the number of 1's becomes odd.)\n- δ(q1, 0) = q1 (If we are in state q1 and read a 0, we stay in q1 because the number of 1's remains odd.)\n- δ(q1, 1) = q0 (If we are in state q1 and read a 1, we move to q0 because the number of 1's becomes even.)\n\nThis DFA has only 2 states and accepts all strings with an even number of 1's."
