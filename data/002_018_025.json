    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches the cube at the center of each face. The diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. In this case, the diameter of the sphere is 8 cm.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius is 8/2 = 4 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nSubstitute the radius into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(4^3)\n\nV = (4/3)π(64)\n\nV = (256/3)π\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately (256/3)π cubic centimeters."
