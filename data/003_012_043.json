    "message_2": "To find the height of the lighthouse, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the lighthouse) and the adjacent side (distance from the ship to the lighthouse).\n\nLet h be the height of the lighthouse. We have:\n\ntan(30°) = h / 20 km\n\nTo find h, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nh = 20 km * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nh ≈ 20 km * 0.577\n\nh ≈ 11.54 km\n\nSince we need the height in meters, we can convert kilometers to meters:\n\nh ≈ 11.54 km * 1000 m/km\n\nh ≈ 11540 m\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the lighthouse is approximately 11,540 meters."
