    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\n2*(x + 2y - 3z) = 2*4\n2x + 4y - 6z = 8\n\nNow, subtract the first equation multiplied by 2 from the second equation:\n\n(2x - y + 4z) - (2x + 4y - 6z) = 7 - 8\n-5y + 10z = -1  (1)\n\nNext, multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation:\n\n3*(x + 2y - 3z) = 3*4\n3x + 6y - 9z = 12\n\n(3x - 4y + 5z) - (3x + 6y - 9z) = 10 - 12\n-10y + 14z = -2  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, y and z:\n\n-5y + 10z = -1\n-10y + 14z = -2\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and adding it to the second equation:\n\n2*(-5y + 10z) = 2*(-1)\n-10y + 20z = -2\n\nAdd the first equation multiplied by 2 to the second equation:\n\n(-10y + 14z) + (-10y + 20z) = -2 + (-2)\n20z = -4\n\nNow, divide by 20 to find the value of z:\n\nz = -4 / 20\nz = -1/5\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find the value of y:\n\n-5y + 10(-1/5) = -1\n-5y - 2 = -1\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n-5y = 1\n\nDivide by -5:\n\ny = -1/5\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them back into the original first equation to find the value of x:\n\nx + 2(-1/5) - 3(-1/5) = 4\nx - 2/5 + 3/5 = 4\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\nx + 1/5 = 4\n\nSubtract 1/5 from both sides:\n\nx = 4 - 1/5\nx = 19/5\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 19/5\ny = -1/5\nz = -1/5"
