    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 15 meters and the width is 10 meters. So, we plug in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2(15 + 10)\nPerimeter = 2(25)\nPerimeter = 50 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is 50 meters."
