    "message_2": "To perform a hypothesis test for a one-way ANOVA with three groups having sample means of 10, 15, and 20 at a significance level of 0.05, we first need to state the null and alternative hypotheses.\n\nNull Hypothesis (H0): The population means of the three groups are equal, i.e., μ1 = μ2 = μ3.\n\nAlternative Hypothesis (H1): At least one population mean is different from the others, i.e., not all population means are equal.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, we need more information, such as the sample sizes and standard deviations for each group. Once we have this information, we can calculate the F-statistic and compare it to the critical value from the F-distribution table.\n\nIf the calculated F-statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between at least one pair of group means. If the F-statistic is less than or equal to the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and cannot conclude that there is a significant difference between the group means.\n\nPlease provide the sample sizes and standard deviations for each group to proceed with the hypothesis testing."
