    "message_1": "A thin metal plate has a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm. The temperature distribution on the plate is given by the function: \n\nT(x,y) = 50sin(πx/10)sin(2πy/5)\n\nwhere T is temperature in degree Celsius, x is the horizontal coordinate in cm, and y is the vertical coordinate in cm. What is the average temperature of the plate?",
    "message_2": "To find the average temperature of the plate, we need to integrate the temperature function T(x, y) over the area of the plate and then divide by the area.\n\nThe area of the plate is A = length × width = 10 cm × 5 cm = 50 cm².\n\nThe average temperature T_avg can be found using the following formula:\n\nT_avg = (1/A) * ∬ T(x, y) dA\n\nwhere the double integral is taken over the area of the plate.\n\nLet's compute the double integral:\n\n∬ T(x, y) dA = ∫(from 0 to 10) ∫(from 0 to 5) 50sin(πx/10)sin(2πy/5) dy dx\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to y:\n\n∫(from 0 to 5) 50sin(πx/10)sin(2πy/5) dy = 50sin(πx/10) * ∫(from 0 to 5) sin(2πy/5) dy\n\n= 50sin(πx/10) * [-5/(2π) * cos(2πy/5)](from 0 to 5)\n\n= 50sin(πx/10) * [-5/(2π) * (cos(2π) - cos(0))]\n\n= 50sin(πx/10) * [-5/(2π) * (1 - 1)]\n\n= 0\n\nNow, we integrate with respect to x:\n\n∫(from 0 to 10) 0 dx = 0\n\nSo, the double integral is 0. Now, we can find the average temperature:\n\nT_avg = (1/A) * ∬ T(x, y) dA = (1/50) * 0 = 0\n\nThe average temperature of the plate is 0 degrees Celsius."
