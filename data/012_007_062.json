We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, let's find an augmenting path from node 1 to node 4. One possible path is 1 -> 2 -> 4. The minimum capacity along this path is min(5, 3) = 3. We will update the residual capacities as follows:\n\n   (1, 2) = 5 - 3 = 2\n   (2, 4) = 3 - 3 = 0\n\n2. Next, let's find another augmenting path. One possible path is 1 -> 3 -> 4. The minimum capacity along this path is min(3, 5) = 3. We will update the residual capacities as follows:\n\n   (1, 3) = 3 - 3 = 0\n   (3, 4) = 5 - 3 = 2\n\n3. Now, let's find another augmenting path. One possible path is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4. The minimum capacity along this path is min(2, 4, 2) = 2. We will update the residual capacities as follows:\n\n   (1, 2) = 2 - 2 = 0\n   (2, 3) = 4 - 2 = 2\n   (3, 4) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nAt this point, there are no more augmenting paths from node 1 to node 4. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows along the paths we found, which is 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. Therefore, the maximum flow that can be sent from node 1 to node 4 is 8."
