    "message_2": "The two graphs G and H are not isomorphic. \n\nTo see why, let's look at the vertices with degree 1 in both graphs. In graph G, vertex 5 is connected to vertex 4, which has a degree of 2. In graph H, vertex 5 is connected to vertex 3, which has a degree of 3. Since the vertices with degree 1 are connected to vertices with different degrees in the two graphs, there cannot be an isomorphism between G and H."
