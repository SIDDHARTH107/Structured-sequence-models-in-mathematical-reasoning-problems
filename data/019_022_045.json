    "message_1": "A company is deciding between two investment options: Option A has a probability of 0.6 of earning a profit of $50,000 and a probability of 0.4 of earning a profit of $20,000. Option B has a probability of 0.8 of earning a profit of $30,000 and a probability of 0.2 of earning a profit of $10,000. Assuming the company wants to maximize its expected profit, which option should they choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option the company should choose, we need to calculate the expected profit for each option.\n\nExpected profit for Option A:\n(0.6 * $50,000) + (0.4 * $20,000) = $30,000 + $8,000 = $38,000\n\nExpected profit for Option B:\n(0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * $10,000) = $24,000 + $2,000 = $26,000\n\nSince the expected profit for Option A ($38,000) is greater than the expected profit for Option B ($26,000), the company should choose Option A to maximize its expected profit."
