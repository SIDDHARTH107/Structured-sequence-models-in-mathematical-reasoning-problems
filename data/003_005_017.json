    "message_2": "To find the value of sin^-1(0.5), we need to determine the angle whose sine is 0.5. In other words, we are looking for an angle θ such that sin(θ) = 0.5.\n\nWe know that sin(30°) = 1/2 = 0.5. Therefore, sin^-1(0.5) = 30°.\n\nIf the student needs the answer in radians, we can convert 30° to radians using the formula:\n\nRadians = (Degrees × π) / 180\n\nRadians = (30 × π) / 180 = π/6\n\nSo, sin^-1(0.5) = π/6 radians."
