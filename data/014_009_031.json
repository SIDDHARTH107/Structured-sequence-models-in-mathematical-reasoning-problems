    "message_1": "Consider an encryption algorithm that uses a Feistel cipher structure with 6 rounds. If the block size is 64 bits and the key size is 128 bits, how many subkeys are generated for each round?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, a subkey is generated for each round of the encryption process. Since there are 6 rounds in this encryption algorithm, 6 subkeys will be generated in total, with one subkey for each round."
