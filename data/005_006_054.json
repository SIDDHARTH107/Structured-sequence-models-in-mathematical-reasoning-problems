    "message_1": "Suppose the weights of apples in a grocery store have a mean of 120g with a standard deviation of 10g. If a random sample of 50 apples is selected, what is the probability that the mean weight of the sample is less than 118g?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample mean and is calculated as:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = 10g and n = 50. So,\n\nSE = 10 / √50 ≈ 1.4142\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 118g. The z-score is the number of standard errors a value is away from the population mean. It is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SE\n\nwhere X is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SE is the standard error.\n\nIn this case, X = 118g, μ = 120g, and SE ≈ 1.4142. So,\n\nz = (118 - 120) / 1.4142 ≈ -1.4142\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -1.4142. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability. \n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being less than -1.4142 is approximately 0.0786 or 7.86%.\n\nSo, there is a 7.86% chance that the mean weight of the sample of 50 apples is less than 118g."
