    "message_2": "To find the total number of Latin squares of size 4, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of Latin squares of size n = n! * (n - 1)! * (n - 2)! * ... * 1!\n\nFor n = 4, the formula becomes:\n\nNumber of Latin squares of size 4 = 4! * 3! * 2! * 1!\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n1! = 1\n\nNow, multiply the factorials:\n\nNumber of Latin squares of size 4 = 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288\n\nSo, there are 288 Latin squares of size 4."
