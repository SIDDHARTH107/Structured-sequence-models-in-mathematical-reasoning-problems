    "message_2": "A Morse-Smale complex is a decomposition of a manifold into cells, where each cell is associated with a critical point of a smooth function on the manifold. The index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point.\n\nIn this case, we have a Morse-Smale complex with 4 cells and 3 critical points. We are given that one critical point is a minimum with index 0, and another critical point is a maximum with index 2. Since there are only 3 critical points, there must be one critical point of index 1, which corresponds to a saddle point.\n\nSo, the index of the remaining critical point is 1."
