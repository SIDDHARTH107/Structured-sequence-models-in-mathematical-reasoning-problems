    "message_1": "A thin copper plate is initially at a uniform temperature of 90°C. It is immersed quickly in a fluid bath that is at a constant temperature of 20°C. The temperature of the plate is measured at various points and is found to be given by the function:\n\nT(x,y) = 90exp[-(x^2+y^2)/4k]\n\nwhere T is the temperature in °C, x and y are measured in cm, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant of copper (k=1.12 x 10^-4 m^2/s). Using the Fourier transform, determine the time required for the center of the plate to reach a temperature of 40°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the time required for the center of the plate to reach a temperature of 40°C, we first need to find the temperature difference between the initial temperature and the desired temperature. Since the plate is initially at 90°C and we want it to reach 40°C, the temperature difference is:\n\nΔT = 90 - 40 = 50°C\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the temperature at the center of the plate (x = 0, y = 0) to decrease by this amount. We can use the given function T(x, y) to find this:\n\nT(0, 0) = 90exp[-(0^2 + 0^2) / 4k] = 90\n\nWe want the temperature at the center to be 40°C, so we can set up the equation:\n\n40 = 90exp[-(0^2 + 0^2) / 4k] * exp(-t/τ)\n\nwhere t is the time we want to find, and τ is the time constant for the cooling process. To find τ, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nexp(-t/τ) = 40/90\n\nNow, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-t/τ = ln(40/90)\n\nt/τ = ln(90/40)\n\nTo find the time constant τ, we can use the relation τ = k / α, where α is the thermal diffusivity constant of copper. Since k = 1.12 x 10^-4 m^2/s and α = 1.12 x 10^-4 m^2/s, we have:\n\nτ = (1.12 x 10^-4 m^2/s) / (1.12 x 10^-4 m^2/s) = 1 s\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation for t:\n\nt = τ * ln(90/40) = 1 * ln(90/40) ≈ 0.9163 s\n\nSo, it takes approximately 0.9163 seconds for the center of the plate to reach a temperature of 40°C."
