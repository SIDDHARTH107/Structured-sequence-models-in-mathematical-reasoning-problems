    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is not a numerical subject and does not lend itself to numerical problems. It is a branch of logic that deals with the concepts of obligation, permission, and prohibition. Could you please provide more information or specify a different subtopic in mathematics?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Please provide a mathematical problem or topic that you would like me to help you with, and I will do my best to assist you."
