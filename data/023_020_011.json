    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the given function, we first need to determine the coefficients a_n, b_n, and the constant term a_0. The function has a period of 3, so L = 3/2. The general formulas for these coefficients are:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)]dx over one period\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L)]dx over one period\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx over one period\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/3) * [∫(-3 to 0) (x - 1) dx + ∫(0 to 3) (x + 1) dx]\na_0 = (1/3) * [(1/2)x^2 - x |(-3 to 0) + (1/2)x^2 + x |(0 to 3)]\na_0 = (1/3) * [(0 - 0) + (9/2 + 3 - 0)]\na_0 = (1/3) * (9/2 + 3)\na_0 = 2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/3) * [∫(-3 to 0) (x - 1)cos(n * π * x / 3/2) dx + ∫(0 to 3) (x + 1)cos(n * π * x / 3/2) dx]\n\nWe can split this into two integrals:\n\na_n = (1/3) * [∫(-3 to 0) (x - 1)cos(n * π * x / 3/2) dx] + (1/3) * [∫(0 to 3) (x + 1)cos(n * π * x / 3/2) dx]\n\nTo solve these integrals, we can use integration by parts. Let u = x - 1 and dv = cos(n * π * x / 3/2) dx for the first integral, and u = x + 1 and dv = cos(n * π * x / 3/2) dx for the second integral.\n\nAfter solving the integrals and simplifying, we get:\n\na_n = (6/(n^2 * π^2)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/3) * [∫(-3 to 0) (x - 1)sin(n * π * x / 3/2) dx + ∫(0 to 3) (x + 1)sin(n * π * x / 3/2) dx]\n\nAgain, we can split this into two integrals:\n\nb_n = (1/3) * [∫(-3 to 0) (x - 1)sin(n * π * x / 3/2) dx] + (1/3) * [∫(0 to 3) (x + 1)sin(n * π * x / 3/2) dx]\n\nUsing integration by parts with u = x - 1 and dv = sin(n * π * x / 3/2) dx for the first integral, and u = x + 1 and dv = sin(n * π * x / 3/2) dx for the second integral, and solving the integrals, we get:\n\nb_n = (-12/(n^2 * π^2)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nFinally, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = 2 + Σ[[(6/(n^2 * π^2)) * (1 - (-1)^n)] * cos(n * π * x / 3/2) - [(12/(n^2 * π^2)) * (1 - (-1)^n)] * sin(n * π * x / 3/2)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) in the range -3 ≤ x < 3."
