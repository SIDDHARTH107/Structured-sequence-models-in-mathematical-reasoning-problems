    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1, 1, 1), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4xyz.\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x - 4yz\n∂F/∂y = 2y - 4xz\n∂F/∂z = 2z - 4xy\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, 1, 1):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 1, 1) = 2(1) - 4(1)(1) = -2\n∂F/∂y(1, 1, 1) = 2(1) - 4(1)(1) = -2\n∂F/∂z(1, 1, 1) = 2(1) - 4(1)(1) = -2\n\nSo, the gradient of the surface at the point (1, 1, 1) is given by the vector <-2, -2, -2>.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\nA(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0\n\nwhere (x0, y0, z0) is the point (1, 1, 1) and (A, B, C) is the gradient <-2, -2, -2>.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n-2(x - 1) - 2(y - 1) - 2(z - 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-2x + 2 - 2y + 2 - 2z + 2 = 0\n\n-2x - 2y - 2z + 6 = 0\n\nDividing by -2:\n\nx + y + z - 3 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1, 1, 1) is:\n\nx + y + z - 3 = 0"
