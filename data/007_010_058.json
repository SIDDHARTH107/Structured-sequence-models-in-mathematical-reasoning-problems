    "message_2": "We are given the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences. Let's find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nNow, we will compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N/3 = 105/3 = 35\nN2 = N/5 = 105/5 = 21\nN3 = N/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverses:\n\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 3) = 35^(-1) (mod 3)\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 5) = 21^(-1) (mod 5)\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 7) = 15^(-1) (mod 7)\n\nWe can find the modular inverses using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or by trial and error:\n\ny1 = 2 (since 35 * 2 = 70 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\ny2 = 1 (since 21 * 1 = 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\ny3 = 1 (since 15 * 1 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nNow, we can find the solution x:\n\nx = (2 * 35 * 2) + (3 * 21 * 1) + (2 * 15 * 1) = 140 + 63 + 30 = 233\n\nHowever, we are looking for the smallest positive integer, so we need to find the smallest positive integer equivalent to 233 modulo 105:\n\nx ≡ 233 (mod 105)\n\n233 = 2 * 105 + 23\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruences is x = 23."
