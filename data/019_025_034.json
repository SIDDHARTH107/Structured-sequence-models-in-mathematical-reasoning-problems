    "message_1": "Suppose a school wants to improve the test scores of its students. The school implements a new program that includes additional study materials and tutoring sessions for struggling students. After implementing the program, the school wants to determine if there is a causal relationship between the program and an increase in test scores. The school decides to measure the average test scores of a random sample of 50 students who participated in the program and a random sample of 50 students who did not participate in the program. \n\nThe average test score of the sample of students who participated in the program was 85 with a standard deviation of 8, while the average test score of the sample of non-participating students was 78 with a standard deviation of 10. Is there enough evidence to suggest that the new program led to increased test scores? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is enough evidence to suggest that the new program led to increased test scores, we will perform a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the average test scores between the two groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a difference in the average test scores between the two groups.\n\nGiven data:\nSample size of participating students (n1) = 50\nSample size of non-participating students (n2) = 50\nMean test score of participating students (x̄1) = 85\nMean test score of non-participating students (x̄2) = 78\nStandard deviation of participating students (s1) = 8\nStandard deviation of non-participating students (s2) = 10\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the pooled standard deviation (sp):\n\nsp = sqrt[((n1 - 1) * s1^2 + (n2 - 1) * s2^2) / (n1 + n2 - 2)]\nsp = sqrt[((50 - 1) * 8^2 + (50 - 1) * 10^2) / (50 + 50 - 2)]\nsp = sqrt[(49 * 64 + 49 * 100) / 98]\nsp = sqrt[(3136 + 4900) / 98]\nsp = sqrt[8036 / 98]\nsp ≈ 9.07\n\nNext, we calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = sp * sqrt[(1/n1) + (1/n2)]\nSE = 9.07 * sqrt[(1/50) + (1/50)]\nSE ≈ 1.82\n\nNow, we calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (x̄1 - x̄2) / SE\nt = (85 - 78) / 1.82\nt ≈ 3.85\n\nFinally, we find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n1 + n2 - 2 = 98:\n\nt_critical ≈ 1.98\n\nSince the calculated t-score (3.85) is greater than the critical t-value (1.98), we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence to suggest that the new program led to increased test scores at a significance level of 0.05."
