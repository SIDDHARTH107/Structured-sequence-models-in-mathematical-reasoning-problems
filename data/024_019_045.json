    "message_2": "To calculate the Gaussian curvature of the surface S described by the equation z = 3 - x^2 - y^2, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Then, we can use the formula for Gaussian curvature in terms of the coefficients of these forms.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface S by the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, 3 - u^2 - v^2). Then, the partial derivatives with respect to u and v are:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, -2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = -2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficients of the second fundamental form. To do this, we first find the normal vector N to the surface:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (2u, 2v, 1)\n\nNow, we can find the second derivatives of r:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, -2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -2)\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = N • r_uu = -2\nM = N • r_uv = 0\nN = N • r_vv = -2\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = (-2 * -2 - 0^2) / ((1 + 4u^2)(1 + 4v^2) - (-2uv)^2)\nK = 4 / (1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2 - 4u^2v^2)\n\nNow, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the total Gaussian curvature. For a compact surface without boundary, the theorem states that:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface. However, the surface S is not compact and has no boundary, so the Gauss-Bonnet theorem does not directly apply. In this case, we cannot find the total Gaussian curvature using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem."
