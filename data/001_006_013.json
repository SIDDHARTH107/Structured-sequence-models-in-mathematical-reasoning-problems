    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a quadratic equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = -2x^2 + 8x - 6\n\nNow, we can try to solve for x by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = -2, b = 8, and c = -6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(8) ± √((8)^2 - 4(-2)(-6))) / 2(-2)\n\nx = (-8 ± √(64 - 48)) / -4\n\nx = (-8 ± √16) / -4\n\nx = (-8 ± 4) / -4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (-8 + 4) / -4 = -4 / -4 = 1\n\nx = (-8 - 4) / -4 = -12 / -4 = 3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation are x = 1 and x = 3."
