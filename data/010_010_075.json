    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 3, we first need to find its derivative f'(x) and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x⁴ - 6x² + 3)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4x³ - 12x\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 4x³ - 12x\n\nWe can factor out a 4x from the equation:\n\n0 = 4x(x² - 3)\n\nNow, we have three factors: 4, x, and (x² - 3). We set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n1) 4 = 0 (This equation has no solution for x)\n\n2) x = 0 (This is one critical point)\n\n3) x² - 3 = 0\n\nTo solve the third equation, we add 3 to both sides:\n\nx² = 3\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nx = ±√3\n\nSo, we have three critical points: x = 0, x = √3, and x = -√3."
