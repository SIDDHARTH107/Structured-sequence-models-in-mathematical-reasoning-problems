    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess for the eigenvector, x = [1, 1, 1].\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current eigenvector x to get a new vector y.\n3. Normalize y to get the new eigenvector x.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's perform a few iterations to get an approximation of the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = [1, 1, 1]\ny = A * x = [6*1 + 2*1 + 1*1, 2*1 + 3*1 + 1*1, 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1] = [9, 6, 3]\nNormalize y: x = y / ||y|| = [9/11.18, 6/11.18, 3/11.18] = [0.805, 0.537, 0.268]\n\nIteration 2:\nx = [0.805, 0.537, 0.268]\ny = A * x = [6*0.805 + 2*0.537 + 1*0.268, 2*0.805 + 3*0.537 + 1*0.268, 1*0.805 + 1*0.537 + 1*0.268] = [6.741, 4.609, 2.610]\nNormalize y: x = y / ||y|| = [6.741/8.583, 4.609/8.583, 2.610/8.583] = [0.786, 0.537, 0.304]\n\nWe can continue this process for more iterations, but for the sake of brevity, let's stop here. The dominant eigenvalue can be approximated by taking the ratio of the components of y and x in the last iteration:\n\nEigenvalue (λ) ≈ y_i / x_i for i = 1, 2, 3\nλ ≈ 6.741/0.805 ≈ 4.609/0.537 ≈ 2.610/0.304 ≈ 8.37\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately 8.37, and its corresponding eigenvector is approximately [0.786, 0.537, 0.304]. Note that more iterations would lead to a more accurate result."
