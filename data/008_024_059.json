    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n(2)(2x + 3y - z) = (2)(7)\n4x + 6y - 2z = 14\n\nNow, add this equation to the second equation:\n(4x + 6y - 2z) + (4x - 2y + z) = 14 + (-1)\n8x + 4y - z = 13\n\nNext, we can eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -1 and add it to the third equation:\n\n(-1)(2x + 3y - z) = (-1)(7)\n-2x - 3y + z = -7\n\nNow, add this equation to the third equation:\n(-2x - 3y + z) + (-2x + 5y - 3z) = -7 + 13\n-4x + 2y - 2z = 6\n\nNow we have two new equations:\n\n8x + 4y - z = 13\n-4x + 2y - 2z = 6\n\nWe can simplify the first equation by dividing by 4:\n\n2x + y - (1/2)z = (13/2)\n\nNow, we can eliminate x from these two equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and adding it to the second equation:\n\n(2)(2x + y - (1/2)z) = (2)((13/2))\n4x + 2y - z = 13\n\nNow, add this equation to the second equation:\n(4x + 2y - z) + (-4x + 2y - 2z) = 13 + 6\n4y - 3z = 19\n\nNow we have a single equation with two variables:\n\n4y - 3z = 19\n\nThis equation cannot be solved for unique values of y and z, which means the original system of linear equations has no unique solution for x, y, and z."
