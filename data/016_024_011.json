    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from an initial larger square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the middle square is removed.\n\nThe number of squares removed in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nsquares_removed = 8^iteration\n\nFor the 5th iteration, we have:\n\nsquares_removed = 8^5 = 32,768\n\nNow, to find the total number of squares in the 5th iteration, we need to subtract the squares removed from the total number of squares in the initial square (which is 1).\n\ntotal_squares = initial_square - squares_removed\ntotal_squares = 1 - 32,768\n\nHowever, this result is negative, which doesn't make sense for counting squares. The issue here is that we're not considering the squares that are created in each iteration. To account for this, we need to sum the squares removed in each iteration from 1 to 5:\n\ntotal_squares = initial_square + (squares_removed_1 + squares_removed_2 + ... + squares_removed_5)\n\ntotal_squares = 1 + (8^1 + 8^2 + 8^3 + 8^4 + 8^5)\ntotal_squares = 1 + (8 + 64 + 512 + 4,096 + 32,768)\ntotal_squares = 1 + 37,448\ntotal_squares = 37,449\n\nSo, there are exactly 37,449 squares in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski carpet."
