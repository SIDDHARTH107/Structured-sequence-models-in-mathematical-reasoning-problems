    "message_2": "If the complement of set A is equal to the complement of set B, then we can say that sets A and B are equal. This is because the complement of a set contains all the elements in the universal set that are not in the original set. If the complements of A and B are equal, it means that both A and B have the same elements missing from the universal set, which implies that they have the same elements in them. Therefore, A = B."
