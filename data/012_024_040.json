    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have V = 10 and E = 15. We need to find the minimum genus g such that the graph can be embedded on a surface of genus g without crossing edges.\n\nFor a graph embedded on a surface of genus g, the inequality is:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6.\n\nWe want to find the smallest integer g such that 15 ≤ 3 * 10 + 6g - 6, which simplifies to:\n\ng ≥ (15 - 30 + 6) / 6.\n\ng ≥ -9 / 6.\n\nSince g must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible value for g is 0. However, we need to check if the graph is planar (g = 0) or non-planar (g > 0).\n\nIf the graph were planar, we could use Euler's formula to find the number of faces:\n\nF = 2 + E - V = 2 + 15 - 10 = 7.\n\nHowever, for a planar graph, the number of edges must also satisfy the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6.\n\nIn our case, this inequality would be:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6.\n\n15 ≤ 24.\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph could be planar, and the genus of the graph G is 0."
