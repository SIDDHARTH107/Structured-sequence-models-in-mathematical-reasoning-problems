    "message_1": "A tree is 20 meters tall. From a distance of 50 meters away from the base of the tree, you measure the angle of elevation to the top of the tree as 35 degrees. Using trigonometry, find the distance between the top of the tree and the ground.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the top of the tree and the ground, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have the angle of elevation (35 degrees) and the distance from the base of the tree (50 meters). We can set up the following equation:\n\ntan(35) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(35) = height of the tree/distance from the base of the tree\n\nWe know the height of the tree is 20 meters and the distance from the base of the tree is 50 meters. So, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\ntan(35) = 20/50\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the top of the tree and the ground (the hypotenuse of the right triangle):\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a is the height of the tree (20 meters), b is the distance from the base of the tree (50 meters), and c is the distance between the top of the tree and the ground.\n\n20^2 + 50^2 = c^2\n400 + 2500 = c^2\n2900 = c^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the value of c:\n\nc = √2900\nc ≈ 53.85 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the top of the tree and the ground is approximately 53.85 meters."
