    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is used to solve complex optimization problems. To find the maximum value of the given function f(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 12x + 4 using the GWO algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of wolves.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each wolf.\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n4. Update the positions of the other wolves.\n5. Check for convergence.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the convergence tolerance is met.\n\nLet's start with the initial population of 4 wolves:\n\nWolf 1 (W1): x1 = 0\nWolf 2 (W2): x2 = 2\nWolf 3 (W3): x3 = 4\nWolf 4 (W4): x4 = 6\n\nNow, calculate the fitness of each wolf:\n\nf(W1) = 0^3 - 7(0)^2 + 12(0) + 4 = 4\nf(W2) = 2^3 - 7(2)^2 + 12(2) + 4 = -4\nf(W3) = 4^3 - 7(4)^2 + 12(4) + 4 = 0\nf(W4) = 6^3 - 7(6)^2 + 12(6) + 4 = 4\n\nNext, update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves:\n\nAlpha (α): W1 (x1 = 0, f(W1) = 4)\nBeta (β): W4 (x4 = 6, f(W4) = 4)\nDelta (δ): W3 (x3 = 4, f(W3) = 0)\n\nNow, update the positions of the other wolves:\n\nW2_new = W2 + A * (α - W2) + B * (β - W2) + C * (δ - W2)\n\nHere, A, B, and C are random coefficients that decrease linearly from 2 to 0 over the course of the iterations. For simplicity, let's assume A = B = C = 1 for the first iteration:\n\nW2_new = 2 + 1 * (0 - 2) + 1 * (6 - 2) + 1 * (4 - 2) = 4\n\nNow, calculate the fitness of the new position:\n\nf(W2_new) = 4^3 - 7(4)^2 + 12(4) + 4 = 0\n\nSince the fitness of W2_new is better than the fitness of the current delta wolf (W3), update the delta wolf:\n\nDelta (δ): W2_new (x2_new = 4, f(W2_new) = 0)\n\nCheck for convergence:\n\nThe difference between the alpha and delta wolves' fitness values is 4 - 0 = 4, which is greater than the convergence tolerance of 0.0001. Therefore, the algorithm has not yet converged.\n\nRepeat steps 2-5 for the remaining iterations or until the convergence tolerance is met. Due to the stochastic nature of the GWO algorithm, the results may vary in each run. However, after several iterations, the algorithm should converge to the maximum value of the function.\n\nNote: The GWO algorithm is typically implemented in a programming language like Python or MATLAB to automate the iterative process and handle the random coefficients."
