    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we first need to create the Playfair cipher table using the key \"MATHEMATICS\". The table will be a 5x5 grid containing the letters of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is usually combined with 'I').\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHEICS\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet in order: BDFGJKLMNOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nThe table will look like this:\n\nM A T H E\nI C S B D\nF G K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message by following the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. Break the ciphertext into pairs: BN AK LU VB XT AF XM TX BI NK\n2. For each pair, if the letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their left (wrapping around if necessary). If they are in the same column, replace them with the letters above them (wrapping around if necessary). If they form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other pair's column.\n\nApplying these rules, we get the decrypted message:\n\nBN -> PL\nAK -> AY\nLU -> FA\nVB -> IR\nXT -> C_\nAF -> E_\nXM -> S_\nTX -> S_\nBI -> AG\nNK -> ES\n\nThe decrypted message is \"PLAYFAIRCESSAG\". Since Playfair cipher sometimes adds an extra letter (usually 'X') to make the pairs, the actual decrypted message is \"PLAYFAIRMESSAGE\"."
