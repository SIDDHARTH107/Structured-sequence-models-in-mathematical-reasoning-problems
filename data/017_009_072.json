    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2). According to the Sylow theorems, there must exist a subgroup of G with order 3. Let's denote this subgroup as H. Since the index of H in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, H must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 9 and the order of H is 3, the order of G/H is 9/3 = 3. Since 3 is a prime number, G/H must be a cyclic group of order 3. Let's denote the generator of G/H as xH.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian\nIn this case, G is a direct product of its subgroups H and the cyclic group generated by x. Since H is of order 3 and the cyclic group generated by x is of order 3, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, which is the cyclic group of order 9, C9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian\nIn this case, we can find an element y in G such that y is not in H and y does not commute with some element in H. Let's denote this non-commuting element in H as h. Since H is a normal subgroup, we have the following relation:\n\nyhy^{-1} = h'\n\nwhere h' is an element in H and h' â‰  h. Now, we can define a new operation on G:\n\n(xy)^n = x^n * y^n\n\nwhere x^n denotes the nth power of x in G/H and y^n denotes the nth power of y in G. This operation is well-defined because G is non-abelian and the elements x and y do not commute. We can verify that this operation satisfies the group axioms, and thus G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 9: the cyclic group C9 and the non-abelian group of order 9."
