    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k defective bulbs\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a defective bulb (0.03)\n- n is the total number of bulbs in the batch (100)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs\n\nWe want to find the probability of producing at least 2 defective bulbs, which means we need to find the probability of producing 2 or more defective bulbs. To do this, we can find the probability of producing 0 or 1 defective bulbs and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X >= 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\n\nFirst, let's find P(X = 0):\n\nC(100, 0) = 1 (since there's only one way to choose 0 items from 100)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * (0.03)^0 * (1-0.03)^(100-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.97)^100 ≈ 0.047\n\nNow, let's find P(X = 1):\n\nC(100, 1) = 100 (since there are 100 ways to choose 1 item from 100)\nP(X = 1) = 100 * (0.03)^1 * (1-0.03)^(100-1) = 100 * 0.03 * (0.97)^99 ≈ 0.235\n\nNow we can find P(X >= 2):\n\nP(X >= 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) = 1 - 0.047 - 0.235 ≈ 0.718\n\nSo, the probability of producing at least 2 defective bulbs in a batch of 100 is approximately 0.718 or 71.8%."
