    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal pattern that can be constructed through a recursive process. The number of line segments in each iteration can be determined using the following formula:\n\nNumber of line segments in the nth iteration = 2^n\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of line segments in the 12th iteration:\n\nNumber of line segments in the 12th iteration = 2^12 = 4096\n\nSo, 4096 line segments are required to draw the 12th iteration of the Dragon curve if the initial curve consists of one line segment with a length of 1 unit."
