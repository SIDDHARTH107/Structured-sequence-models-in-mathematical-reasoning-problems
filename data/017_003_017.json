    "message_2": "To prove that every group of prime order p is cyclic, we will use the fact that the order of an element in a group divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem).\n\nLet G be a group of prime order p. We want to show that G is cyclic, which means there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince G has order p, there are p elements in G, including the identity element e. Now, let's consider any non-identity element g in G. We will show that the subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has order p, which would imply that G is cyclic.\n\nBy definition, ⟨g⟩ = {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^(p-1)}. We want to show that these p elements are distinct, which would imply that the order of ⟨g⟩ is p.\n\nSuppose there exist two distinct integers i and j (0 ≤ i, j ≤ p-1) such that g^i = g^j. Without loss of generality, assume i > j. Then, g^(i-j) = g^i * (g^j)^(-1) = g^i * g^(-j) = e. This means that the order of g divides i-j.\n\nHowever, since p is a prime number, the only divisors of p are 1 and p itself. If the order of g is 1, then g = e, which contradicts our assumption that g is a non-identity element. Therefore, the order of g must be p.\n\nSince the order of g is p, the subgroup ⟨g⟩ has p elements, which means ⟨g⟩ = G. Thus, G is a cyclic group generated by the element g. This proves that every group of prime order p is cyclic."
