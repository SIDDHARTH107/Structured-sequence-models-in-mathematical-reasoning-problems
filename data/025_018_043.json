Use Mori theory to find the value of the intersection number $I(P,Q)$ between the curves $C$ and $L$, where $L$ is the line passing through $P$ and $Q$.",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection number $I(P,Q)$ between the curves $C$ and $L$, we first need to find the equation of the line $L$ passing through points $P$ and $Q$. \n\nThe line passing through $P = (1,1,2)$ and $Q = (1, -1, 2)$ can be parameterized as follows:\n\n$L: (1, 1 + t, 2)$, where $t$ is a parameter.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points between the curve $C$ and the line $L$. To do this, we substitute the parameterization of $L$ into the equation of $C$:\n\n$(1)^3 + (1 + t)^3 = (2)^3$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$1 + (1 + 3t + 3t^2 + t^3) = 8$\n\n$1 + 1 + 3t + 3t^2 + t^3 = 8$\n\n$t^3 + 3t^2 + 3t - 6 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation. We can see that $t = 1$ is a root:\n\n$(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = 0$\n\nSo, we can factor the cubic equation as follows:\n\n$(t - 1)(t^2 + 4t + 6) = 0$\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor has no real roots, so there are no other real intersection points between $C$ and $L$. Since we are working in the complex plane, we need to find the complex roots of the quadratic factor:\n\n$t^2 + 4t + 6 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$t = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(6)}}{2} = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, there are two complex intersection points between $C$ and $L$. \n\nNow, we can use Mori theory to find the intersection number $I(P,Q)$. In Mori theory, the intersection number is the sum of the local intersection numbers at each intersection point. Since there are three intersection points (one real and two complex), we need to find the local intersection numbers at each point.\n\nFor the real intersection point $t = 1$, the local intersection number is 1, as the curve $C$ and the line $L$ intersect transversally at this point.\n\nFor the complex intersection points $t = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{2}$, the local intersection numbers are also 1, as the curve $C$ and the line $L$ intersect transversally at these points as well.\n\nTherefore, the intersection number $I(P,Q)$ between the curves $C$ and $L$ is:\n\n$I(P,Q) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$"
