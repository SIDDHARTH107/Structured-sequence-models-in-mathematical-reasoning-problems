    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to break down each square root into its simplest form.\n\n$\\sqrt{27}$ can be written as $\\sqrt{3^3}$, which simplifies to $3\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n$\\sqrt{12}$ can be written as $\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3}$, which simplifies to $2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n$\\sqrt{48}$ can be written as $\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3}$, which simplifies to $4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the original expression with the simplified square roots:\n\n$3\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{3} + 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, we can combine the terms with the same square root:\n\n$(3 - 2 + 4)\\sqrt{3} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is $5\\sqrt{3}$."
