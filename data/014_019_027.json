    "message_2": "A transposition cipher with a block length of 6 means that each block contains 6 characters. A key of length 4 means that the key is a permutation of 4 distinct positions within the block.\n\nTo find the number of possible distinct keys, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 4 distinct positions from the 6 available positions in the block. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of positions (6 in this case) and k is the number of positions to choose (4 in this case).\n\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4!(6-4)!)\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4!2!)\nC(6, 4) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(2*1))\nC(6, 4) = (6*5) / (2*1)\nC(6, 4) = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to choose 4 distinct positions from the 6 available positions in the block.\n\nNow, for each of these 15 choices, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 4 positions. This can be calculated using the permutation formula:\n\nP(k) = k!\n\nwhere k is the number of positions to arrange (4 in this case).\n\nP(4) = 4!\nP(4) = 4*3*2*1\nP(4) = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to arrange the 4 positions for each of the 15 choices.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of possible distinct keys, we multiply the number of ways to choose the positions by the number of ways to arrange them:\n\nTotal distinct keys = 15 choices * 24 arrangements\nTotal distinct keys = 360\n\nTherefore, there are 360 possible distinct keys for this transposition cipher."
