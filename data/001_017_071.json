    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x-1) + log(x+2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nStep 1: Combine the logarithms using the product rule.\nlog((x-1)(x+2)) = 2\n\nStep 2: Remove the logarithm by raising both sides as powers of 10.\n10^(log((x-1)(x+2))) = 10^2\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation.\n(x-1)(x+2) = 100\n\nStep 4: Expand the equation.\nx^2 + 2x - x - 2 = 100\n\nStep 5: Combine like terms.\nx^2 + x - 2 = 100\n\nStep 6: Move all terms to one side of the equation.\nx^2 + x - 102 = 0\n\nStep 7: Factor the quadratic equation.\n(x - 9)(x + 11) = 0\n\nStep 8: Solve for x.\nx - 9 = 0 or x + 11 = 0\nx = 9 or x = -11\n\nHowever, since we have a logarithm in the original equation, we need to check if these solutions are valid. A logarithm is only defined for positive arguments, so we need to make sure that both (x-1) and (x+2) are positive.\n\nFor x = 9:\n(9-1) > 0 and (9+2) > 0, so x = 9 is a valid solution.\n\nFor x = -11:\n(-11-1) < 0, so x = -11 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution for the equation log(x-1) + log(x+2) = 2 is x = 9."
