    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,5) is the smallest integer n such that any complete graph of n vertices contains either a triangle (a complete subgraph with 3 vertices) or an independent set of 5 vertices (a set of 5 vertices with no edges between them).\n\nTo find R(3,5), we can use the inequality R(m,n) ≤ R(m-1,n) + R(m,n-1) for m, n ≥ 2. \n\nUsing this inequality, we can calculate R(3,5) as follows:\n\n1. R(2,5) = 5 (since R(2,n) = n)\n2. R(3,4) ≤ R(2,4) + R(3,3) = 4 + 6 = 10\n3. R(3,5) ≤ R(2,5) + R(3,4) = 5 + 10 = 15\n\nSo, R(3,5) ≤ 15. However, we need to verify if there exists a complete graph with 14 vertices that does not contain a triangle or an independent set of 5 vertices. It turns out that there is no such graph, so the smallest integer that satisfies the condition is 15.\n\nTherefore, the Ramsey number R(3,5) is 15."
