    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a potential question:\n\n\"Suppose a company hires a manager to oversee a project. The manager has two options: exert high effort (E), which will result in a successful project with probability 0.8 and a payout of $100,000, or exert low effort (L), which will result in a successful project with probability 0.4 and a payout of $50,000. However, the manager has a 50% chance of being lazy (not exerting optimal effort) unless monitored, and monitoring the manager costs the company $10,000. Should the company monitor the manager to prevent moral hazard? If so, what is the net expected benefit to the company considering the monitoring cost?\" \n\nThe student would need to use their understanding of game theory and moral hazard to determine the optimal decision for the company and calculate the expected payoff.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the company should monitor the manager, we need to compare the expected payoffs of monitoring and not monitoring.\n\n1. If the company does not monitor the manager:\nThere is a 50% chance the manager will exert high effort (E) and a 50% chance they will exert low effort (L).\n\nExpected payoff for high effort (E): 0.8 * $100,000 = $80,000\nExpected payoff for low effort (L): 0.4 * $50,000 = $20,000\n\nTotal expected payoff without monitoring = 0.5 * ($80,000 + $20,000) = $50,000\n\n2. If the company monitors the manager:\nThe manager will exert high effort (E) since they are being monitored.\n\nExpected payoff for high effort (E): 0.8 * $100,000 = $80,000\nMonitoring cost: $10,000\n\nTotal expected payoff with monitoring = $80,000 - $10,000 = $70,000\n\nComparing the expected payoffs:\n\nWithout monitoring: $50,000\nWith monitoring: $70,000\n\nThe company should monitor the manager to prevent moral hazard, as the net expected benefit is higher when monitoring. The net expected benefit to the company considering the monitoring cost is:\n\nNet expected benefit = Expected payoff with monitoring - Expected payoff without monitoring = $70,000 - $50,000 = $20,000"
