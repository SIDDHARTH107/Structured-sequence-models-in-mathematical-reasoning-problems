The production of each product requires the use of two machines, Machine 1 and Machine 2. The table below shows the time (in hours) required to produce one unit of each product using each machine, as well as the total production time available on each machine per week.\n\n| Product/Machine | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Total Production Time/Week (hours) |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|\n| Product A       | 3         | 2         | 60                                |\n| Product B       | 1         | 4         | 80                                |\n\nYour goal is to determine how many units of each product to produce per week in order to maximize total production, subject to the condition that the production time on each machine is fully utilized.\n\nWhat are the optimal production quantities of Product A and Product B per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced per week and y be the number of units of Product B produced per week. We need to maximize the total production, which is x + y, subject to the constraints given by the production times on each machine.\n\nThe constraints can be written as follows:\n\n3x + 1y ≤ 60 (Machine 1)\n2x + 4y ≤ 80 (Machine 2)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\n\ny ≤ 60 - 3x (Machine 1)\ny ≤ 20 - 0.5x (Machine 2)\n\nNow we need to find the feasible region, which is the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy both constraints. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. To find these points, we can set the right-hand sides of the constraints equal to each other:\n\n60 - 3x = 20 - 0.5x\n40 = 2.5x\nx = 16\n\nNow we can plug this value of x back into either constraint to find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 60 - 3(16)\ny = 60 - 48\ny = 12\n\nSo the optimal production quantities are 16 units of Product A and 12 units of Product B per week."
