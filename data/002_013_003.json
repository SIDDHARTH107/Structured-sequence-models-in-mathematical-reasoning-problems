    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 12 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nIn this case, the length is 12 cm, the width is 8 cm, and the height is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 12 * 8 * 5\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 480\n\nVolume = 160 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
