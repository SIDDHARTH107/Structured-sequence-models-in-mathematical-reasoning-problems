    "message_1": "A market research study shows that 30% of customers who visit a store end up making a purchase. If 50 customers enter the store today, what is the probability that at least 20 customers will make a purchase?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (purchases) in n trials (customers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of trials (customers)\n- k is the number of successes (purchases)\n- p is the probability of success (30% or 0.3)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (70% or 0.7)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 20 customers make a purchase, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for 20, 21, 22, ..., 50 customers making a purchase.\n\nP(X >= 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 20) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.3)^k * (0.7)^(50-k)] for k = 20 to 50\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 20) ≈ 0.1502\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 customers will make a purchase is approximately 15.02%."
