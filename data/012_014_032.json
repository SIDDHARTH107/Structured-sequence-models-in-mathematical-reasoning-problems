    "message_2": "To determine if graphs G and H are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency between the vertices is preserved.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs:\n\nFor graph G:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 2 and 3)\n- Vertex 2 has degree 1 (connected to vertex 1)\n- Vertex 3 has degree 1 (connected to vertex 1)\n\nFor graph H:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 1 (connected to vertex 2)\n- Vertex 2 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 3)\n- Vertex 3 has degree 1 (connected to vertex 2)\n\nBoth graphs have the same number of vertices with the same degrees, which is a necessary condition for isomorphism. Now, let's try to find a possible correspondence between the vertices of G and H.\n\nPossible correspondence:\n- Vertex 1 in G corresponds to vertex 2 in H (both have degree 2)\n- Vertex 2 in G corresponds to vertex 1 in H (both have degree 1)\n- Vertex 3 in G corresponds to vertex 3 in H (both have degree 1)\n\nNow, let's check if the adjacency between vertices is preserved under this correspondence:\n\nIn graph G, vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 3. Under the correspondence, this would mean that vertex 2 in H should be connected to vertices 1 and 3, which is true.\n\nIn graph G, vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1. Under the correspondence, this would mean that vertex 1 in H should be connected to vertex 2, which is true.\n\nIn graph G, vertex 3 is connected to vertex 1. Under the correspondence, this would mean that vertex 3 in H should be connected to vertex 2, which is true.\n\nSince the adjacency between vertices is preserved under the correspondence, we can conclude that graphs G and H are isomorphic."
