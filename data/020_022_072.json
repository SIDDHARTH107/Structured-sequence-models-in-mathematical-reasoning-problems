    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $500,000 for advertising campaigns to be carried out through three media channels: TV, radio, and social media. The expected returns of each channel are estimated as follows: $10 in return for each dollar spent on TV, $8 in return for each dollar spent on radio, and $5 in return for each dollar spent on social media. How should the company allocate the budget across the three channels to maximize the total expected return?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total expected return, the company should allocate the budget to the channels with the highest return per dollar spent. In this case, the returns are as follows:\n\nTV: $10 per dollar spent\nRadio: $8 per dollar spent\nSocial Media: $5 per dollar spent\n\nSince TV has the highest return per dollar spent, the company should allocate the entire budget of $500,000 to TV advertising. This will maximize the total expected return.\n\nTotal expected return = (Budget allocated to TV) * (Return per dollar spent on TV)\nTotal expected return = $500,000 * $10\nTotal expected return = $5,000,000"
