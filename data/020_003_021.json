    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products - Product A and Product B. It costs 5 dollars to produce each unit of Product A and 4 dollars to produce each unit of Product B. The company has a budget of 100,000 dollars for production costs and must produce at least 20,000 units of each product to meet demand. The company earns a profit of 10 dollars for each unit of Product A sold and 8 dollars for each unit of Product B sold. \n\nThe goal is to maximize the company's profit. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe cost function is given by:\nC(x, y) = 5x + 4y\n\nThe profit function is given by:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 8y\n\nThe company has a budget of 100,000 dollars for production costs, so:\n5x + 4y ≤ 100,000\n\nThe company must produce at least 20,000 units of each product to meet demand, so:\nx ≥ 20,000\ny ≥ 20,000\n\nTo maximize the company's profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of units of Product A that can be produced within the budget:\n5x ≤ 100,000\nx ≤ 20,000\n\nSince x must be at least 20,000, the maximum number of units of Product A that can be produced is 20,000.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of units of Product B that can be produced within the budget, given that 20,000 units of Product A are produced:\n5(20,000) + 4y ≤ 100,000\n100,000 + 4y ≤ 100,000\n4y ≤ 0\ny ≤ 0\n\nSince y must be at least 20,000, the maximum number of units of Product B that can be produced is 20,000.\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit for producing 20,000 units of each product:\nP(20,000, 20,000) = 10(20,000) + 8(20,000) = 200,000 + 160,000 = 360,000\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce is 20,000 units of Product A and 20,000 units of Product B, which will result in a profit of 360,000 dollars."
