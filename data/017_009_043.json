    "message_2": "Let Z(G) be the center of the group G. Since G has order 9, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of Z(G) must be a divisor of 9, i.e., 1, 3, or 9.\n\nWe are given that Z(G) is nontrivial, which means the order of Z(G) cannot be 1. If the order of Z(G) is 9, then Z(G) = G, which implies that G is abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to C9, since there is only one abelian group of order 9 up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group C9.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the order of Z(G) is 3. Since Z(G) is a subgroup of G, there exists an element g in G that is not in Z(G). Let H = <g> be the cyclic subgroup generated by g. Since g is not in Z(G), the order of H must be greater than 1. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must be a divisor of 9, so the order of H can be 3 or 9.\n\nIf the order of H is 9, then H = G, which means G is cyclic and isomorphic to C9. If the order of H is 3, then |G| = |Z(G)||H|, and since Z(G) and H are both subgroups of G, their intersection must be the identity element. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of Z(G) and H, i.e., G = Z(G) Ã— H.\n\nNow, let z be an element of Z(G) and h be an element of H. Since Z(G) is the center of G, we have zh = hz for all z in Z(G) and h in H. Thus, G is abelian. Since G is an abelian group of order 9, it must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nIn all cases, we have shown that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
