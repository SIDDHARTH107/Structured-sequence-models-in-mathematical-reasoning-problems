    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two models of smartphones: Model X and Model Y. Each Model X earns a profit of $40 and each Model Y earns a profit of $50. The company can produce a maximum of 5000 smartphones per week due to limited resources. Model X requires 1 hour of labor and 2 GB of storage per smartphone, while Model Y requires 1.5 hours of labor and 1 GB of storage per smartphone. The company has 9000 hours of labor and 10000 GB of storage available per week. Use the cuckoo search algorithm to determine the optimal number of each model of smartphone to produce in order to maximize the weekly profit.\n\nHint: The objective function for this optimization problem is: Maximize 40X + 50Y, subject to the constraints: X + 1.5Y <= 5000, X + 2Y <= 9000, Y <= 10000, X >= 0, Y >= 0",
    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. However, it is not suitable for solving this problem analytically. Instead, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method.\n\nLet's solve it graphically:\n\n1. First, we need to plot the constraint inequalities on a graph:\n\nX + 1.5Y <= 5000\nX + 2Y <= 9000\nY <= 10000\nX >= 0\nY >= 0\n\n2. Find the feasible region: The feasible region is the area on the graph where all the constraints are satisfied.\n\n3. Identify the corner points of the feasible region: In this case, there are 4 corner points: (0, 0), (0, 5000), (4500, 0), and (3000, 3000).\n\n4. Evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n\n40(0) + 50(0) = 0\n40(0) + 50(5000) = 250000\n40(4500) + 50(0) = 180000\n40(3000) + 50(3000) = 270000\n\n5. Choose the corner point with the highest value of the objective function: In this case, the highest value is 270000, which occurs at the corner point (3000, 3000).\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to produce 3000 units of Model X and 3000 units of Model Y per week, which will result in a maximum weekly profit of $270,000."
