    "message_2": "The total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after the 7th iteration. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(7/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^3.5)\nLength = 1 * (2^3 * 2^0.5)\nLength = 1 * (8 * √2)\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 7th iteration is 8√2."
