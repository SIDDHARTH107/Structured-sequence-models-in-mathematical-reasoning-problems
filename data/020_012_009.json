    "message_1": "The question is: \n\nA company has a profit function given by P(x) = -x^3 + 12x^2 + 9x, where x is the number of units sold. Determine the maximum profit that the company can earn.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function P(x) and determine which of these points corresponds to a maximum value. We can do this by finding the first and second derivatives of P(x) and analyzing their values.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of P(x) with respect to x:\n\nP'(x) = d/dx (-x^3 + 12x^2 + 9x)\nP'(x) = -3x^2 + 24x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting P'(x) equal to 0 and solving for x:\n\n-3x^2 + 24x + 9 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -3, b = 24, and c = 9. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-24 ± √(24^2 - 4(-3)(9))) / 2(-3)\nx = (-24 ± √(576 + 108)) / -6\nx = (-24 ± √684) / -6\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x:\n\nx1 = (-24 + √684) / -6\nx2 = (-24 - √684) / -6\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of P(x) to determine the concavity of the function at these critical points:\n\nP''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (-x^3 + 12x^2 + 9x)\nP''(x) = -6x + 24\n\nNow, let's evaluate P''(x) at the critical points x1 and x2:\n\nP''(x1) = -6x1 + 24\nP''(x2) = -6x2 + 24\n\nIf P''(x) is positive at a critical point, then the function is concave up and the point is a local minimum. If P''(x) is negative, then the function is concave down and the point is a local maximum.\n\nSince we are looking for the maximum profit, we want to find the critical point where P''(x) is negative. Let's check both critical points:\n\nP''(x1) = -6((-24 + √684) / -6) + 24\nP''(x1) = 24 - √684\n\nSince √684 is greater than 24, P''(x1) is negative, which means x1 corresponds to a local maximum.\n\nNow let's check x2:\n\nP''(x2) = -6((-24 - √684) / -6) + 24\nP''(x2) = 24 + √684\n\nP''(x2) is positive, which means x2 corresponds to a local minimum.\n\nSince we are looking for the maximum profit, we can ignore x2 and focus on x1. Now, let's find the maximum profit by plugging x1 back into the original profit function P(x):\n\nP(x1) = -((-24 + √684) / -6)^3 + 12((-24 + √684) / -6)^2 + 9((-24 + √684) / -6)\n\nCalculating this value, we get:\n\nP(x1) ≈ 291.69\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit that the company can earn is approximately $291.69."
