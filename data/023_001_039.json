    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a0, an, and bn.\n\na0 = (1/π) ∫[f(x)] dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) = x for -π ≤ x < 0 and f(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x < π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na0 = (1/π) [ ∫[x] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[0] dx from 0 to π ]\n\na0 = (1/π) [ (x^2/2) | from -π to 0 + 0 | from 0 to π ]\n\na0 = (1/π) [ (0 - (-π)^2/2) + 0 ]\n\na0 = (1/π) (π^2/2)\n\na0 = π/2\n\nNow, let's find an:\n\nan = (1/π) ∫[f(x) cos(nπx)] dx from -π to π\n\nan = (1/π) [ ∫[x cos(nπx)] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[0 cos(nπx)] dx from 0 to π ]\n\nThe second integral is 0 since f(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x < π.

Since the function is odd, we can conclude that an = 0.\n\nNow, let's find bn:\n\nbn = (1/π) ∫[f(x) sin(nπx)] dx from -π to π\n\nbn = (1/π) [ ∫[x sin(nπx)] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[0 sin(nπx)] dx from 0 to π ]\n\nThe second integral is 0 since f(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x < π. So, we only need to compute the first integral:\n\nbn = (1/π) ∫[x sin(nπx)] dx from -π to 0\n\nUsing integration by parts (similar to the process for an):\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(nπx) dx\nThen du = dx and v = (-1/nπ) cos(nπx)\n\nbn = (1/π) [ (-x(1/nπ) cos(nπx)) | from -π to 0 + ∫[(1/nπ) cos(nπx)] dx from -π to 0 ]\n\nbn = (1/π) [ 0 + (1/nπ) (1/nπ) sin(nπx) | from -π to 0 ]\n\nbn = (1/π) [ (1/nπ) (1/nπ) (sin(0) - sin(-nπ)) ]\n\nbn = (1/π) [ (1/nπ) (1/nπ) (0 - (-1)^n) ]\n\nFor n even, (-1)^n = 1, and for n odd, (-1)^n = -1. So, bn = 0 for n even and bn = (2/nπ) for n odd.\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series:\n\nf(x) = π/2 + ∑ [ 0 * cos(nπx) + ((2/nπ) * sin(nπx)) ] from n=1 to ∞ for n odd\n\nf(x) = π/2 + ∑ [(2/nπ) sin(nπx)] from n=1 to ∞ for n odd"
