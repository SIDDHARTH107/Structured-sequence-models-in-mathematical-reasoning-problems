    "message_2": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we first need to find the determinant of the matrix. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is given by (ad - bc).\n\nFor the given matrix [3 5; 4 7], the determinant is (3*7) - (5*4) = 21 - 20 = 1.\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of the matrix exists. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is given by (1/determinant) * [d -b; -c a].\n\nSo, the inverse of the matrix [3 5; 4 7] is (1/1) * [7 -5; -4 3] = [7 -5; -4 3].\n\nThe inverse matrix for use in decrypting the message encrypted using the Hill cipher with key matrix [3 5; 4 7] and block size of 2 is [7 -5; -4 3]."
