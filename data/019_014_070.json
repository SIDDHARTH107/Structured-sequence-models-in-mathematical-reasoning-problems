    "message_2": "To prove if the function f(n) = n + 2 satisfies the statement ∀f : (ℕ → ℕ), ∃x : ℕ, f(x) = x + 5, we need to find a natural number x such that f(x) = x + 5.\n\nLet's substitute the given function into the statement:\n\nf(x) = x + 2\n\nWe want to find x such that:\n\nx + 2 = x + 5\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n2 = 5\n\nThis equation is not true, which means we cannot find a natural number x that satisfies the given statement for the function f(n) = n + 2. Therefore, the function f(n) = n + 2 does not satisfy the statement ∀f : (ℕ → ℕ), ∃x : ℕ, f(x) = x + 5."
