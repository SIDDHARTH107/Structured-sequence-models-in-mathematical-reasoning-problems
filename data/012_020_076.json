In other words, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that keep the adjacency matrix unchanged.\n\nLet's label the vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6. We can see that the graph has the following edges: (v1, v2), (v1, v6), (v2, v3), (v2, v5), (v3, v4), (v3, v5), (v4, v5), and (v4, v6).\n\nNow, let's find the automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism: (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6) -> (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6)\n2. The permutation (v1, v6)(v2, v5)(v3, v4): (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6) -> (v6, v5, v4, v3, v2, v1)\n\nWe can check that these two permutations preserve the adjacency relations:\n\n1. The identity automorphism obviously preserves the adjacency relations.\n2. The permutation (v1, v6)(v2, v5)(v3, v4) maps the edges as follows:\n   (v1, v2) -> (v6, v5)\n   (v1, v6) -> (v6, v1)\n   (v2, v3) -> (v5, v4)\n   (v2, v5) -> (v5, v2)\n   (v3, v4) -> (v4, v3)\n   (v3, v5) -> (v4, v5)\n   (v4, v5) -> (v3, v5)\n   (v4, v6) -> (v3, v1)\n\nSince there are no other permutations that preserve the adjacency relations, the automorphism group of the graph G is the group generated by the permutation (v1, v6)(v2, v5)(v3, v4), which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_2 (the group of all permutations of two elements)."
