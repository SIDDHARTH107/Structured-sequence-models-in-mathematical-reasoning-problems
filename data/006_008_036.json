    "message_2": "Given that the average number of rainy days in a month is 8, we can use the Poisson distribution to calculate the probability of the city experiencing rain exactly 10 days in the next month.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (rainy days), k is the desired number of events (10 rainy days), λ is the average number of events (8 rainy days), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) = (8^10 * e^(-8)) / 10!\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(X = 10) = (1073741824 * e^(-8)) / 3628800\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ (1073741824 * 0.00033546) / 3628800\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 360.042 / 3628800\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.0992\n\nSo, the probability of the city experiencing rain exactly 10 days in the next month is approximately 0.0992 or 9.92%."
