    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to compute the first and second derivatives of the vector function r(t).\n\nGiven r(t) = 4cos(t)i + 4sin(t)j + 3t^2k, let's find the first derivative r'(t):\n\nr'(t) = -4sin(t)i + 4cos(t)j + 6tk\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative r''(t):\n\nr''(t) = -4cos(t)i - 4sin(t)j + 6k\n\nNow, we need to evaluate r'(t) and r''(t) at t = π/3:\n\nr'(π/3) = -4sin(π/3)i + 4cos(π/3)j + 6(π/3)k\n         = -4(√3/2)i + 4(1/2)j + 6(π/3)k\n         = -2√3i + 2j + 2πk\n\nr''(π/3) = -4cos(π/3)i - 4sin(π/3)j + 6k\n          = -4(1/2)i - 4(√3/2)j + 6k\n          = -2i - 2√3j + 6k\n\nNow, let's find the curvature (kappa) using the formula:\n\nkappa = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product r'(t) x r''(t):\n\nr'(π/3) x r''(π/3) = (-2√3i + 2j + 2πk) x (-2i - 2√3j + 6k)\n                   = -12√3k + 12πj - 12i\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(π/3)|| = √((-2√3)^2 + 2^2 + (2π)^2)\n            = √(12 + 4 + 4π^2)\n\nNow, let's find the curvature kappa:\n\nkappa = ||r'(π/3) x r''(π/3)|| / ||r'(π/3)||^3\n      = √((-12)^2 + (12π)^2 + (-12)^2) / (√(12 + 4 + 4π^2))^3\n      = √(144 + 144π^2 + 144) / (12 + 4 + 4π^2)^(3/2)\n      = √(288 + 144π^2) / (12 + 4π^2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (tau) using the formula:\n\ntau = (r'(t) x r''(t) • r'''(t)) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nSince r'''(t) = 0i + 0j + 0k (constant acceleration), the dot product of r'(t) x r''(t) and r'''(t) will be zero. Therefore, the torsion tau is:\n\ntau = 0\n\nSo, the curvature and torsion of the curve at t = π/3 are:\n\nkappa = √(288 + 144π^2) / (12 + 4π^2)^(3/2)\ntau = 0"
