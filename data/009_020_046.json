    "message_1": "A ball is thrown vertically upwards from the ground with an initial velocity of 10 m/s. The ball experiences air resistance proportional to its velocity, with a constant of proportionality equal to 0.2. Assume the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s^2. Find the height of the ball at the time when it reaches its maximum height.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the ball at its maximum height, we first need to find the time it takes to reach that height. At the maximum height, the velocity of the ball will be 0. We can use the following equation to find the time:\n\nv(t) = v0 - g*t - k*v(t)*t\n\nwhere v(t) is the velocity at time t, v0 is the initial velocity (10 m/s), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), k is the constant of proportionality (0.2), and t is the time.\n\nAt the maximum height, v(t) = 0, so we have:\n\n0 = 10 - 9.8*t - 0.2*v(t)*t\n\nSince v(t) = 0 at the maximum height, the equation simplifies to:\n\n0 = 10 - 9.8*t\n\nNow we can solve for t:\n\nt = 10 / 9.8 ≈ 1.02 s\n\nNow that we have the time it takes to reach the maximum height, we can find the height using the following equation:\n\nh(t) = h0 + v0*t - 0.5*g*t^2 - 0.5*k*v(t)*t^2\n\nwhere h(t) is the height at time t, h0 is the initial height (0 m), and the other variables are the same as before.\n\nAt the maximum height, v(t) = 0, so the equation simplifies to:\n\nh(t) = 0 + 10*t - 0.5*9.8*t^2\n\nNow we can plug in the value of t we found earlier:\n\nh(t) ≈ 0 + 10*1.02 - 0.5*9.8*(1.02)^2\nh(t) ≈ 10.2 - 5.1*1.0404\nh(t) ≈ 10.2 - 5.30604\n\nh(t) ≈ 4.89396 m\n\nSo, the height of the ball at its maximum height is approximately 4.89 meters."
