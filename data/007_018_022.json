    "message_2": "To find the smallest pair of consecutive prime numbers with a gap of 20, we can start by checking prime numbers starting from the smallest prime number, 2. We can then check the difference between consecutive prime numbers until we find a pair with a gap of 20.\n\nAfter checking prime numbers, we find that the smallest pair of consecutive prime numbers with a gap of 20 is 89 and 109. The difference between these two prime numbers is 109 - 89 = 20."
