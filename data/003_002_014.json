    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle with the given information. Let A be the angle of 60 degrees, and let a be the side opposite to angle A, which is 6 cm. Let B be the right angle, and let C be the remaining angle. Let b be the side opposite to angle B, and let c be the side opposite to angle C (the hypotenuse).\n\nSince the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, and we have a right triangle, we can find angle C:\n\nC = 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees\n\nNow we can use the sine and cosine ratios to find the lengths of the other two sides:\n\nsin(A) = a/c\nsin(60) = 6/c\nc = 6/sin(60) = 6/(√3/2) = 12/√3 = 4√3 cm\n\ncos(A) = b/c\ncos(60) = b/(4√3)\nb = cos(60) * 4√3 = (1/2) * 4√3 = 2√3 cm\n\nNow that we have all the side lengths, we can find the six trigonometric ratios for the 60-degree angle:\n\nsin(60) = a/c = 6/(4√3) = √3/2\ncos(60) = b/c = (2√3)/(4√3) = 1/2\ntan(60) = a/b = 6/(2√3) = √3\n\ncsc(60) = 1/sin(60) = 2/√3 = 2√3/3\nsec(60) = 1/cos(60) = 2\ncot(60) = 1/tan(60) = 1/√3 = √3/3\n\nSo, the other two sides are b = 2√3 cm and c = 4√3 cm, and the six trigonometric ratios for the 60-degree angle are sin(60) = √3/2, cos(60) = 1/2, tan(60) = √3, csc(60) = 2√3/3, sec(60) = 2, and cot(60) = √3/3."
