    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 9, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are divisors of 9, which are 1, 3, and 9. If G has an element of order 9, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C9. If not, then all non-identity elements in G must have order 3.\n\nLet's count the number of elements of order 3 in G. Suppose there are k elements of order 3 in G. Each element of order 3 generates a subgroup of order 3, and these subgroups have the identity element in common. Since there are 8 non-identity elements in G, we have:\n\n1 + 2(k) = 8\n\nSolving for k, we get k = 3.5, which is not an integer. This means that our assumption that all non-identity elements have order 3 is incorrect. Therefore, G must have an element of order 9, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, and there are no elements of order 3 in G."
