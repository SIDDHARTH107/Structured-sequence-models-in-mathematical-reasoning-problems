    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 10 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length by the width:\nArea_top/bottom = 8 cm * 5 cm = 40 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is:\n2 * 40 cm² = 80 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the width by the height:\nArea_front/back = 5 cm * 10 cm = 50 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is:\n2 * 50 cm² = 100 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the length by the height:\nArea_left/right = 8 cm * 10 cm = 80 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is:\n2 * 80 cm² = 160 cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together to find the total surface area:\nTotal_surface_area = 80 cm² + 100 cm² + 160 cm² = 340 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 340 cm²."
