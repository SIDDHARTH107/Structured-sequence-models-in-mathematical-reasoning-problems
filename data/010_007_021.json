If $\\tilde{x_0},\\tilde{x_1}$ are two distinct points in $\\tilde{X}$ such that $p(\\tilde{x_0}) = p(\\tilde{x_1}) = x_0$, then what is the number of paths in $X$ from $x_0$ to itself that lift to paths in $\\tilde{X}$ starting at $\\tilde{x_0}$ and ending at $\\tilde{x_1}$?",
    "message_2": "Let $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ denote the fundamental group of $X$ based at $x_0$. Since $X$ is path-connected and its fundamental group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, we can represent the elements of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ as integer multiples of a generator, say $g$. \n\nNow, consider the covering map $p: \\tilde{X} \\to X$. Since it has two sheets, the fiber $p^{-1}(x_0)$ consists of two points, $\\tilde{x_0}$ and $\\tilde{x_1}$. Let $\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0})$ denote the fundamental group of $\\tilde{X}$ based at $\\tilde{x_0}$. The covering map induces a homomorphism $p_*: \\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}) \\to \\pi_1(X, x_0)$.\n\nWe want to find the number of paths in $X$ from $x_0$ to itself that lift to paths in $\\tilde{X}$ starting at $\\tilde{x_0}$ and ending at $\\tilde{x_1}$. This is equivalent to finding the number of loops in $X$ based at $x_0$ such that their lifts under $p$ start at $\\tilde{x_0}$ and end at $\\tilde{x_1}$.\n\nLet $\\gamma$ be a loop in $X$ based at $x_0$ such that its lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ starts at $\\tilde{x_0}$ and ends at $\\tilde{x_1}$. Then, $p(\\tilde{\\gamma}) = \\gamma$. Since $p$ is a covering map, the homomorphism $p_*$ is injective. Therefore, $p_*(\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}))$ is a subgroup of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$.\n\nNow, consider the loop $\\gamma$ in $X$ corresponding to the generator $g$ of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$. Since $\\tilde{X}$ has two sheets, the lift of $\\gamma$ starting at $\\tilde{x_0}$ must end at $\\tilde{x_1}$. Thus, the subgroup $p_*(\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}))$ must contain the element $g$.\n\nSince $p_*$ is injective and $p_*(\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}))$ is a subgroup of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ containing $g$, it must be the case that $p_*(\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0})) = \\pi_1(X, x_0)$. Therefore, every loop in $X$ based at $x_0$ can be lifted to a path in $\\tilde{X}$ starting at $\\tilde{x_0}$ and ending at $\\tilde{x_1}$.\n\nSince $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, there are infinitely many loops in $X$ based at $x_0$. Thus, there are infinitely many paths in $X$ from $x_0$ to itself that lift to paths in $\\tilde{X}$ starting at $\\tilde{x_0}$ and ending at $\\tilde{x_1}$."
