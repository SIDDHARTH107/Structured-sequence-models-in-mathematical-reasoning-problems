    "message_1": "A ladder with a length of 12 meters is placed against an equilateral triangle-shaped wall in such a way that it reaches the top of the wall. What is the length of each side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of each side of the equilateral triangle as \"a\". Since all angles in an equilateral triangle are 60 degrees, we can use the properties of 30-60-90 triangles to solve this problem.\n\nWhen the ladder is placed against the wall, it forms a 30-60-90 triangle with the wall and the ground. The ladder acts as the hypotenuse of this triangle, which has a length of 12 meters. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the side lengths is 1:√3:2, where the shortest side is opposite the 30-degree angle, the middle side is opposite the 60-degree angle, and the longest side (the hypotenuse) is opposite the 90-degree angle.\n\nLet's denote the side opposite the 30-degree angle as \"x\" and the side opposite the 60-degree angle as \"y\". Then, we have the following relationships:\n\nx/1 = y/√3 = 12/2\n\nSince the ladder reaches the top of the wall, the side opposite the 60-degree angle (y) is equal to half of the side length of the equilateral triangle (a/2). Therefore, we can write:\n\ny = a/2\n\nNow, we can solve for \"a\" using the ratios:\n\ny/√3 = 12/2\na/2√3 = 12/2\na/2√3 = 6\na = 12√3\n\nSo, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 12√3 meters."
