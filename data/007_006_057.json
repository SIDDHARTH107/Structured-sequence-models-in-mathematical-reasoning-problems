    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 64 and 96 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (96) by the smaller number (64) and find the remainder.\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder obtained in the previous step.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0. The GCD is the non-zero remainder obtained in the second last step.\n\nStep 1:\n96 รท 64 = 1 with a remainder of 32\n\nStep 2:\nReplace 96 with 64 and 64 with 32\n\nStep 3:\n64 รท 32 = 2 with a remainder of 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the non-zero remainder obtained in the previous step, which is 32. Therefore, the GCD of 64 and 96 is 32."
