    "message_1": "A student wants to perform principal component analysis on a dataset of 100 observations and 10 variables. How many principal components should they choose if they want to explain at least 80% of the variance in the data?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of principal components needed to explain at least 80% of the variance in the data, the student should perform the following steps:\n\n1. Perform PCA on the dataset.\n2. Calculate the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.\n3. Select the smallest number of principal components that cumulatively explain at least 80% of the variance.\n\nWithout the actual dataset, we cannot provide the exact number of principal components needed. However, the student can follow these steps to find the answer using their dataset."
