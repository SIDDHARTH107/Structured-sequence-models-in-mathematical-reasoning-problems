    "message_1": "Consider the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the field of integers modulo 7 (i.e., E is the set of points (x,y) in Z_7 x Z_7 that satisfy the above equation). \n\nWhat is the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve E?",
    "message_2": "To find the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve E, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity. We can do this by iterating through all possible x and y values in Z_7 and checking if they satisfy the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2.\n\nHere's a table of all the points that satisfy the equation:\n\nx | y\n-----\n0 | 3\n0 | 4\n1 | 1\n1 | 6\n2 | 2\n2 | 5\n3 | 2\n3 | 5\n4 | 1\n4 | 6\n5 | 0\n6 | 0\n\nThere are 12 points in the table, and we need to add the point at infinity, so the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve E is 13."
