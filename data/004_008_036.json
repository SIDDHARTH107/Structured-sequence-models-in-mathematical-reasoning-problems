    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 at the point where x = 2, we need to find the slope of the tangent line and the coordinates of the point on the curve.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the point on the curve where x = 2:\n\ny = 3(2)^2 - 4(2) + 5\ny = 3(4) - 8 + 5\ny = 12 - 8 + 5\ny = 9\n\nSo the point on the curve is (2, 9).\n\nNext, we need to find the slope of the tangent line. To do this, we'll find the derivative of the curve with respect to x, which will give us the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe derivative of y = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we'll find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 9) by plugging x = 2 into the derivative:\n\ndy/dx = 6(2) - 4\ndy/dx = 12 - 4\ndy/dx = 8\n\nSo the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 9) is 8.\n\nFinally, we'll use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the point on the curve (2, 9) and m is the slope of the tangent line (8):\n\ny - 9 = 8(x - 2)\n\nNow, we'll simplify the equation:\n\ny - 9 = 8x - 16\ny = 8x - 7\n\nSo the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 at the point where x = 2 is:\n\ny = 8x - 7"
