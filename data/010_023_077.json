    "message_2": "Let S be the closed oriented surface of genus g, and let K be the knot in S that intersects itself transversely in k points. Let C_1, C_2, ..., C_n be the connected components of the complement of K in S. We want to determine the Euler characteristic of the complement of K, which is the sum of the Euler characteristics of the connected components:\n\nχ(S - K) = χ(C_1) + χ(C_2) + ... + χ(C_n).\n\nFirst, let's determine the Euler characteristic of the surface S. Since S is a closed oriented surface of genus g, it can be represented as a connected sum of g tori. The Euler characteristic of a torus is 0, so the Euler characteristic of S is:\n\nχ(S) = 2 - 2g.\n\nNow, let's consider the knot K. Since K intersects itself transversely in k points, we can think of K as being divided into k + 1 arcs, each of which is embedded in S. Each arc contributes one edge and one vertex to S, so the total number of vertices and edges added to S by K is k + 1.\n\nTo compute the Euler characteristic of the complement of K, we need to subtract the Euler characteristic of K from the Euler characteristic of S. The Euler characteristic of K is:\n\nχ(K) = (k + 1) - (k + 1) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the complement of K is:\n\nχ(S - K) = χ(S) - χ(K) = (2 - 2g) - 0 = 2 - 2g.\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the complement of K in the closed oriented surface of genus g is 2 - 2g."
