    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we will use the fact that a group of prime order is always cyclic. Let's consider the order of an element g in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of g must divide the order of G, which is 7. Since 7 is prime, the possible orders of g are 1 and 7.\n\nIf the order of g is 1, then g is the identity element of G. There can only be one identity element in a group, so there must be at least one other element in G with order 7. Let's call this element a.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by a, i.e., H = {a^0, a^1, a^2, ..., a^6}. Since a has order 7, all these elements are distinct, and thus, H has 7 elements. Since G also has 7 elements and H is a subgroup of G, we must have H = G. This means that G is generated by a single element a, and therefore, G is cyclic.\n\nNow, let's find all the generators of G. Since G is cyclic, any element with order 7 will generate G. We know that a has order 7, so a is a generator. To find the other generators, we need to find the elements in G with order 7.\n\nLet's consider the powers of a: a^1, a^2, ..., a^6. We know that a^0 = e (the identity element) has order 1, and a has order 7. Let's check the orders of the other powers of a.\n\n- (a^2)^2 = a^4, (a^2)^3 = a^6, (a^2)^4 = a^8 = a, (a^2)^5 = a^10 = a^3, (a^2)^6 = a^12 = a^5, and (a^2)^7 = a^14 = e. Thus, a^2 has order 7.\n- (a^3)^2 = a^6, (a^3)^3 = a^9 = a^2, (a^3)^4 = a^12 = a^5, (a^3)^5 = a^15 = a^8 = a, (a^3)^6 = a^18 = a^4, and (a^3)^7 = a^21 = e. Thus, a^3 has order 7.\n- (a^4)^2 = a^8 = a, (a^4)^3 = a^12 = a^5, (a^4)^4 = a^16 = a^2, (a^4)^5 = a^20 = a^6, (a^4)^6 = a^24 = a^3, and (a^4)^7 = a^28 = e. Thus, a^4 has order 7.\n- (a^5)^2 = a^10 = a^3, (a^5)^3 = a^15 = a, (a^5)^4 = a^20 = a^6, (a^5)^5 = a^25 = a^4, (a^5)^6 = a^30 = a^2, and (a^5)^7 = a^35 = e. Thus, a^5 has order 7.\n- (a^6)^2 = a^12 = a^5, (a^6)^3 = a^18 = a^4, (a^6)^4 = a^24 = a^3, (a^6)^5 = a^30 = a^2, (a^6)^6 = a^36 = a, and (a^6)^7 = a^42 = e. Thus, a^6 has order 7.\n\nSo, all the non-identity powers of a have order 7, and therefore, they are all generators of G. In conclusion, G is a cyclic group of order 7, and its generators are a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, and a^6."
