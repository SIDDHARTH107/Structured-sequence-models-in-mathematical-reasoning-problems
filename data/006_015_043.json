    "message_1": "If the probability of a certain type of cyber attack occurring on a network is 0.15, and the network is attacked 40 times a year, what is the expected number of times this specific type of cyberattack will occur on the network in a year?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of times this specific type of cyber attack will occur on the network in a year, you can multiply the probability of the attack occurring (0.15) by the total number of attacks in a year (40).\n\nExpected number of attacks = Probability of attack × Total number of attacks\nExpected number of attacks = 0.15 × 40\nExpected number of attacks = 6\n\nSo, the expected number of times this specific type of cyber attack will occur on the network in a year is 6 times."
