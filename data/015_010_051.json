Let's use the Poincaré map to study the behavior of this function.\n\nStarting with an initial value of x₀ = 0.5, apply the function f(x) repeatedly for 10 iterations. \nThen, calculate the Poincaré map by recording the value of x after every 2 iterations, starting with the second iteration. \nFinally, plot the resulting points on a graph and determine whether the behavior is chaotic or not.",

The points appear to oscillate between positive and negative values, but they do not exhibit the characteristics of a chaotic system."
