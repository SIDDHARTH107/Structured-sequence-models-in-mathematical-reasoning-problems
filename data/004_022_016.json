    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of cardboard has dimensions of 30 cm by 40 cm. You want to cut squares of equal size from each corner of the cardboard to create an open box. If the volume of the box should be 3000 cm³, what is the maximum length of the square that can be cut out of each corner?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner. After cutting the squares, the dimensions of the open box will be (30-2x) cm, (40-2x) cm, and x cm for length, width, and height, respectively.\n\nThe volume of the box can be calculated as:\n\nVolume = Length × Width × Height\n\nGiven that the volume should be 3000 cm³, we can set up the equation:\n\n3000 = (30-2x)(40-2x)x\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\n3000 = 4x³ - 140x² + 1200x\n\nDivide the equation by 4:\n\n750 = x³ - 35x² + 300x\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nx³ - 35x² + 300x - 750 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the positive value of x that satisfies the equation. Since it's a cubic equation, it may be difficult to solve algebraically. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the value of x.\n\nUsing a graphing calculator or an online graphing tool, we can find that the approximate value of x that satisfies the equation is:\n\nx ≈ 5 cm\n\nSo, the maximum length of the square that can be cut out of each corner is approximately 5 cm."
