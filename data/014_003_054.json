If the ciphertext (C) generated using ElGamal encryption algorithm is (7, 20), find the plaintext message (M) that corresponds to this ciphertext.",
    "message_2": "To find the plaintext message (M) that corresponds to the given ciphertext (C) in ElGamal Cryptography, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the public key X: X = g^x mod p\n2. Decrypt the ciphertext (C) to find the plaintext message (M)\n\nStep 1: Calculate the public key X\nX = g^x mod p\nX = 5^12 mod 23\nX = 7\n\nNow, we have the public key X = 7, the private key x = 12, and the ciphertext C = (7, 20).\n\nStep 2: Decrypt the ciphertext (C) to find the plaintext message (M)\nThe decryption formula in ElGamal Cryptography is:\nM = (C2 * (C1^x)^(-1)) mod p\n\nFirst, we need to calculate (C1^x)^(-1) mod p:\n(C1^x)^(-1) mod p = (7^12)^(-1) mod 23\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem, we can find the modular inverse:\n(7^12)^(-1) mod 23 = 9\n\nNow, we can find the plaintext message (M):\nM = (C2 * (C1^x)^(-1)) mod p\nM = (20 * 9) mod 23\nM = 180 mod 23\nM = 11\n\nSo, the plaintext message (M) that corresponds to the given ciphertext (C) is M = 11."
