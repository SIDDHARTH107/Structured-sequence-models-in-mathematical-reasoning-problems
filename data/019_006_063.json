    "message_1": "Sorry, but deontic logic does not directly involve numerical problems or calculations. Deontic logic is the study of the logic of obligation, permission, and related concepts. It deals with principles of reasoning about what actions are required, forbidden, or allowed, given certain circumstances or norms. Therefore, it is better suited to asking questions that involve reasoning about actions and normative concepts, rather than numerical calculations. Would you like me to provide a question from deontic logic?",
    "message_2": "Yes, I understand that deontic logic is not about numerical problems or calculations. I apologize for any confusion. Here's a question from deontic logic:\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n1. If it is raining, you must take an umbrella.\n2. It is raining.\n\nUsing deontic logic, what can we conclude from these statements?"
