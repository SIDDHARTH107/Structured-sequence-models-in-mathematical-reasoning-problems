    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0, we can try to factor it or use synthetic division to find its roots.\n\nLet's try factoring by grouping:\n\nx^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0\n\nGroup the terms:\n\n(x^3 - 6x^2) + (11x - 6) = 0\n\nFactor out the common factors:\n\nx^2(x - 6) + 1(11x - 6) = 0\n\nNow, we can see that both terms have a common binomial factor of (x - 6):\n\nx^2(x - 6) + 1(x - 6) = 0\n\nFactor out the common binomial factor:\n\n(x - 6)(x^2 + 1) = 0\n\nNow, we have factored the polynomial into two factors. To find the roots, we set each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 6 = 0\nx^2 + 1 = 0\n\nSolving the first equation:\n\nx = 6\n\nSolving the second equation:\n\nx^2 = -1\nx = ±√(-1)\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number, the roots are:\n\nx = 6 (real root)\nx = i (imaginary root)\nx = -i (imaginary root)\n\nSo, the solutions to the polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 are x = 6, x = i, and x = -i."
