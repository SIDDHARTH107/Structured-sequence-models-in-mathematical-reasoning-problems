    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the steady-state form:\n\n∂u/∂t + u∂u/∂x + v∂u/∂y = -1/ρ ∂p/∂x + ν(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n∂v/∂t + u∂v/∂x + v∂v/∂y = -1/ρ ∂p/∂y + ν(∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y²)\n\nwhere u and v are the velocity components in the x and y directions, respectively, p is the pressure, ρ is the fluid density, and ν is the kinematic viscosity.\n\nSince the problem is symmetric with respect to the x-direction, we can assume that the pressure gradient in the x-direction is zero (∂p/∂x = 0). Also, the flow is incompressible, so the continuity equation is:\n\n∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the Navier-Stokes equations using the given initial and boundary conditions. We will use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t) and v(x, y, t) = 0, since the initial condition for v is zero and there is no driving force in the y-direction.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the continuity equation, we get:\n\nX'(x)Y(y) + 0 = 0\n\nSince Y(y) ≠ 0, we have X'(x) = 0, which implies that X(x) = C1, a constant. Now, applying the boundary conditions for u:\n\nu(0, y, t) = u(1, y, t) => C1Y(y)T(t) = C1Y(y)T(t) => C1 = 0\n\nThus, u(x, y, t) = 0 for all t. This result is consistent with the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = 2x(1 - y) and the boundary conditions at the top and bottom walls.\n\nFor the v component, since there is no driving force in the y-direction and the initial condition is v(x, y, 0) = 0, we can conclude that v(x, y, t) = 0 for all t.\n\nSo, the velocity field for this 2D laminar flow problem is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = 0\nv(x, y, t) = 0"
