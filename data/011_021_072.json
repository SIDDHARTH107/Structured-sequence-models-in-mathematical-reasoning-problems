The distance between each city is given below:\n\nCity A to City B = 10 km\nCity A to City C = 20 km\nCity A to City D = 15 km\nCity A to City E = 30 km\nCity B to City C = 25 km\nCity B to City D = 12 km\nCity B to City E = 20 km\nCity C to City D = 18 km\nCity C to City E = 22 km\nCity D to City E = 35 km\n\nWhat is the shortest route that the salesperson can take to visit all 5 cities and return to the original starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible routes and calculating their total distances. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible routes. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5, resulting in 24 unique routes to consider. Here are the routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A: 10+25+18+35+30 = 118 km\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A: 10+25+22+35+15 = 107 km\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A: 10+12+18+22+30 = 92 km\n4.
