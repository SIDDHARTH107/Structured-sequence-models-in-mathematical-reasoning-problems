    "message_1": "A telecommunication company wants to perform a study to see how different levels of two factors, signal strength and antenna height, affect the signal quality on their network towers. They decide to use an L16 orthogonal array to conduct the study. How many runs (experimental conditions) will they need to perform in order to complete the study?",
    "message_2": "An L16 orthogonal array is a specific type of experimental design that allows for the study of multiple factors at different levels with a reduced number of runs. In this case, the \"16\" in L16 indicates that there will be 16 runs (experimental conditions) needed to complete the study."
