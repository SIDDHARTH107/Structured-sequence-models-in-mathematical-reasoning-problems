    "message_2": "To prove that the set of natural numbers has an infinite cardinality using higher-order logic, we can use the concept of bijections and the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nDefinition: A set is considered infinite if there is no bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the set and any of its proper subsets. A set is considered finite if there exists such a bijection.\n\nLet N be the set of natural numbers, N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that N is finite. This means there exists a bijection between N and one of its proper subsets. Let's consider the proper subset N' = {1, 2, 3, ...}.\n\nNow, let's define a function f: N â†’ N' such that f(n) = n + 1 for every n in N. This function is a bijection, as it maps each natural number to its successor, which is also a natural number.\n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In our case, the \"pigeons\" are the elements of N, and the \"pigeonholes\" are the elements of N'. Since N has one more element (0) than N', there must be at least one element in N' that is the image of two different elements in N under the function f.\n\nBut this contradicts the fact that f is a bijection, as bijections must map each element in the domain to a unique element in the codomain. Therefore, our assumption that N is finite must be false.\n\nThus, we conclude that the set of natural numbers N has an infinite cardinality."
