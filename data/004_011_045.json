    "message_1": "A streetlight that is 10 meters tall casts a shadow on the ground. The angle of elevation from the tip of the streetlight to the top of the shadow on the ground is 60 degrees. If a person moves away from the streetlight at a rate of 8 meters per second, how fast is the length of the shadow on the ground changing when she is 20 meters away from the streetlight? (Hint: this is a related rates problem)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the shadow on the ground as x meters. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation, the height of the streetlight, and the length of the shadow:\n\ntan(60°) = (10 m) / x\n\nSince tan(60°) = √3, we have:\n\n√3 = (10 m) / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (10 m) / √3\n\nNow, let's differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n(dx/dt) = - (10 m) / (3x^2) * (dx/dt)\n\nWe are given that the person is moving away from the streetlight at a rate of 8 meters per second, so dx/dt = 8 m/s when the person is 20 meters away from the streetlight.\n\nTo find the length of the shadow when the person is 20 meters away from the streetlight, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + (10 m)^2 = (20 m)^2\n\nx^2 = (20 m)^2 - (10 m)^2 = 300 m^2\n\nx = √(300 m^2) = 10√3 m\n\nNow, we can plug this value of x back into the equation for dx/dt:\n\n(dx/dt) = - (10 m) / (3 * (10√3 m)^2) * (8 m/s)\n\n(dx/dt) = - (10 m) / (3 * 300 m^2) * (8 m/s)\n\n(dx/dt) = - (80 m/s) / (900 m)\n\n(dx/dt) = - 8/90 m/s\n\nTherefore, the length of the shadow on the ground is changing at a rate of -8/90 meters per second, or approximately -0.089 m/s, when the person is 20 meters away from the streetlight. The negative sign indicates that the shadow is getting shorter as the person moves away from the streetlight."
