    "message_2": "To prove that (p-1)! + 1 is always divisible by p for any prime number p, we will use Wilson's Theorem. Wilson's Theorem states that for any prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In other words, (p-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p).\n\nProof:\n\nConsider the set of integers {1, 2, 3, ..., p-1}. Since p is a prime number, all these integers are relatively prime to p, meaning their greatest common divisor with p is 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of all these integers modulo p:\n\n1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (p-1) ≡ (p-1)! (mod p)\n\nFor each integer i in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., p-1}, there exists a unique inverse i' such that i * i' ≡ 1 (mod p). Note that i ≠ i' except for i = 1 and i = p-1, since 1 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod p) and (p-1) * (p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, we can pair up the integers in the set with their inverses, and their product modulo p will be 1. The only unpaired integers are 1 and p-1, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, the product of all the integers in the set modulo p can be written as:\n\n1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (p-1) ≡ 1 * (p-1) (mod p)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n(p-1)! ≡ (p-1) (mod p)\n\nNow, we know that (p-1) * (p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p), so we can multiply both sides of the equation by (p-1):\n\n(p-1)! * (p-1) ≡ (p-1) * (p-1) (mod p)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p)\n\nAdding 1 to both sides, we get:\n\n(p-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p)\n\nThis means that (p-1)! + 1 is always divisible by p for any prime number p, as required."
