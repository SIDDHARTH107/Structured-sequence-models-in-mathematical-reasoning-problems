    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 6 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (6^3)\nV = (4/3) * π * 216\nV = 288 * π\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 6 cm is approximately 904.78 cubic centimeters (rounded to two decimal places)."
