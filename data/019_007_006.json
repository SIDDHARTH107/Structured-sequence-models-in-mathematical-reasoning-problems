    "message_1": "Sorry, but it is not possible to provide a precise numerical problem based on the subtopic Non-monotonic logic as it deals with rules that may not necessarily lead to a certain conclusion or outcome. Non-monotonic logic is used to deal with uncertainty and incomplete information, and as such, it is difficult to provide a specific numerical problem.",
    "message_2": "That's correct. Non-monotonic logic is a branch of logic that deals with reasoning and drawing conclusions from incomplete or uncertain information. It is not a numerical problem that can be solved like an equation or a mathematical expression. Instead, it is a way of understanding and modeling how humans and artificial intelligence systems make decisions and reason under uncertainty. If you have any other mathematical problems or questions, feel free to ask."
