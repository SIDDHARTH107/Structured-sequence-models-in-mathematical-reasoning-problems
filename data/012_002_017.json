    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of the graph G, we need to find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's consider the maximum degree (Δ) of the graph G. Since G has 6 vertices and 7 edges, the maximum degree cannot be more than 5 (if a vertex is connected to all other vertices). \n\nAccording to the theorem, the chromatic number χ(G) is bounded by the inequality:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nNow, let's check if the graph G is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If G is a complete graph with 6 vertices, it would have (6 * 5) / 2 = 15 edges, which is not the case. Moreover, an odd cycle would require an odd number of vertices, which is not the case either.\n\nSince G is neither a complete graph nor an odd cycle, we can use the upper bound of the inequality:\n\nχ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nWe know that Δ(G) cannot be more than 5, so:\n\nχ(G) ≤ 5 + 1\nχ(G) ≤ 6\n\nHowever, we need to find the minimum number of colors needed. To do this, we can analyze different cases of Δ(G):\n\n1. If Δ(G) = 5, then every vertex is connected to all other vertices, which makes G a complete graph. But we already ruled out this possibility.\n\n2. If Δ(G) = 4, then at least one vertex is connected to 4 other vertices. In this case, we can color the graph using 4 colors, as the maximum degree vertex will not be connected to one of the vertices, and we can use the same color for those two non-adjacent vertices.\n\n3. If Δ(G) = 3, then at least one vertex is connected to 3 other vertices. In this case, we can color the graph using 3 colors, as the maximum degree vertex will not be connected to two of the vertices, and we can use the same color for those two non-adjacent vertices.\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum number of colors, we can conclude that the chromatic number of the graph G is 3."
