    "message_1": "Suppose you roll a fair six-faced dice three times. What is the probability of getting at least one 5 in those three rolls?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least one 5 in three rolls, we can use the complementary probability method. We will first find the probability of not getting a 5 in any of the three rolls, and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nThe probability of not getting a 5 in a single roll is 5/6 (since there are 5 other outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6).\n\nThe probability of not getting a 5 in all three rolls is (5/6) × (5/6) × (5/6) = 125/216.\n\nNow, we'll find the complementary probability, which is the probability of getting at least one 5 in the three rolls:\n\n1 - (125/216) = 91/216\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least one 5 in three rolls of a fair six-faced dice is 91/216."
