    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 18. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 (since 18 = 2 * 9) and n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2 (since 18 = 3^2 * 2) and n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for n_3 is 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the cases for n_2:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 2. Since it is unique, it is normal in G. Similarly, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9, which is also normal in G. In this case, G is the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, and G is isomorphic to the external direct product of P_2 and P_3. Since P_2 is of order 2, it is isomorphic to Z_2 (the cyclic group of order 2). P_3 is of order 9, and there are two possibilities for its isomorphism: either Z_9 (the cyclic group of order 9) or Z_3 × Z_3 (the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). Therefore, in this case, we have two possible non-isomorphic groups: Z_2 × Z_9 and Z_2 × (Z_3 × Z_3).\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 2. However, since n_3 = 1, there is still a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9, which is normal in G. In this case, G cannot be the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, but we can use the semidirect product. Let P_2 be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups. Then, G is the semidirect product of P_3 and P_2. Since P_3 has two possible isomorphisms (Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3), we need to analyze the possible actions of P_2 on P_3 for each case:\n\n   a. If P_3 is isomorphic to Z_9, there are φ(9) = 6 possible automorphisms of P_3. However, P_2 has only one non-trivial element, so it can act non-trivially on P_3 in at most one way. This gives us one more non-isomorphic group.\n\n   b. If P_3 is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3, there are (3^2 - 1)(3^2 - 3) = 8 * 6 = 48 possible automorphisms of P_3. However, P_2 can still only act non-trivially on P_3 in at most one way. This gives us one more non-isomorphic group.\n\nIn total, we have found 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 18:\n\n1. Z_2 × Z_9\n2. Z_2 × (Z_3 × Z_3)\n3. A semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_2\n4. A semidirect product of (Z_3 × Z_3) and Z_2"
