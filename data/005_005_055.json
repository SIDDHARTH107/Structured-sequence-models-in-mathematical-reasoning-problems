    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected person will have an IQ score between 115 and 130, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-score) table.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the IQ scores to Z-scores using the formula:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere Z is the Z-score, X is the IQ score, μ is the mean (average) IQ score, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor an IQ score of 115:\nZ1 = (115 - 100) / 15 = 1\n\nFor an IQ score of 130:\nZ2 = (130 - 100) / 15 ≈ 2\n\nNow, we can look up the probabilities for these Z-scores in the standard normal distribution table. The probability for Z1 (1) is 0.8413, and the probability for Z2 (2) is 0.9772.\n\nTo find the probability of a person having an IQ score between 115 and 130, we subtract the probability of Z1 from the probability of Z2:\n\nP(115 < IQ < 130) = P(Z2) - P(Z1) = 0.9772 - 0.8413 = 0.1359\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person will have an IQ score between 115 and 130 is approximately 13.59%."
