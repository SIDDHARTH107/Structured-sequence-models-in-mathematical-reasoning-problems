    "message_1": "Suppose you have a knot consisting of 6 crossings. If the knot is unknotted, then it can be transformed to a simple planar loop without any knot crossings. Determine the minimum number of crossing changes necessary to transform the knot into an unknotted loop.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of crossing changes necessary to transform the knot into an unknotted loop, we can use the concept of knot invariants. One such invariant is the Jones polynomial, which can help us determine if a knot is unknotted or not.\n\nFor an unknotted loop, the Jones polynomial is equal to 1. If the Jones polynomial of the given knot is not equal to 1, then the knot is not unknotted. In this case, we need to change the crossings to make it unknotted.\n\nThe minimum number of crossing changes required to unknot a knot is called its unknotting number. Unfortunately, there is no general formula to compute the unknotting number for a knot with an arbitrary number of crossings. However, we can use some known results for specific knots.\n\nFor a knot with 6 crossings, there are two possibilities: either it is the 6_1 knot (also known as the Stevedore's knot) or the 6_2 knot (also known as the 6-crossing torus knot). The unknotting number of the 6_1 knot is 1, and the unknotting number of the 6_2 knot is 2.\n\nSo, without more information about the specific knot, we can say that the minimum number of crossing changes necessary to transform the knot into an unknotted loop is either 1 or 2."
