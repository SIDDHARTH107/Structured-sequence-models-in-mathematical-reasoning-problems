    "message_1": "How many non-isomorphic groups of order 120 exist, based on the given information that there are 487 non-abelian groups of order 120?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we first need to find the number of abelian groups of order 120. The order of a group is the number of its elements. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, the number of abelian groups of order n is given by the product of the partition numbers of the prime powers in the prime factorization of n. In this case, we need to find the partition numbers of 2^3, 3, and 5.\n\nFor 2^3, there are three partitions: (1,1,1), (2,1), and (3). So, there are 3 partition numbers for 2^3.\nFor 3, there is only one partition: (1). So, there is 1 partition number for 3.\nFor 5, there is only one partition: (1). So, there is 1 partition number for 5.\n\nThe number of abelian groups of order 120 is the product of these partition numbers: 3 * 1 * 1 = 3.\n\nNow, we know that there are 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. To find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we add the number of abelian groups to the number of non-abelian groups:\n\nTotal non-isomorphic groups of order 120 = Abelian groups + Non-abelian groups = 3 + 487 = 490.\n\nSo, there are 490 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
