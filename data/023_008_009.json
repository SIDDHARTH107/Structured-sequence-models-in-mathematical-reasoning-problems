    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients for the given non-periodic function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 1 on the interval -π to π, we first need to make the function periodic by extending it to a periodic function g(x) with period 2π. We can do this by defining g(x) as:\n\ng(x) = f(x) for -π ≤ x ≤ π\ng(x + 2π) = g(x) for all x\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier coefficients for g(x) using the Fourier series formula:\n\ng(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nTo find the coefficients, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] g(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] g(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] g(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficients for g(x):\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x^2 + 5x + 1) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x^2 + 5x + 1) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x^2 + 5x + 1) * sin(nx) dx\n\nAfter evaluating the integrals, we get:\n\na_0 = (1/3) * (π^2 + 6π + 6)\na_n = (10/(n^2 * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) - (5/n) * (1 - cos(nπ))\nb_n = (2/n^3) * (1 - (-1)^n) - (5/n^2) * sin(nπ)\n\nSince f(x) is an even function, its Fourier series will only contain cosine terms. Therefore, the Fourier series for f(x) on the interval -π to π is:\n\nf(x) = (1/3) * (π^2 + 6π + 6) + Σ [(10/(n^2 * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) - (5/n) * (1 - cos(nπ))] * cos(nx)"
