    "message_1": "Consider a group G of order 27. If the center of G is trivial, then every element of G can be written as a product of two distinct cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 9. How many different pairwise products of these subgroups are there in G?",
    "message_2": "Let H and K be the cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 9, respectively. Since G has order 27, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 9 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 9. However, since the center of G is trivial, n_3 cannot be 1 (otherwise, G would be abelian). Therefore, n_3 = 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 9-subgroups. The number of Sylow 9-subgroups (n_9) divides 3 and n_9 ≡ 1 (mod 9). Thus, n_9 can only be 1. So, there is a unique Sylow 9-subgroup, which we denote as K.\n\nSince there are 9 Sylow 3-subgroups, let's denote them as H_1, H_2, ..., H_9. Each of these subgroups has 2 non-identity elements (since they are of order 3), and K has 8 non-identity elements (since it is of order 9).\n\nNow, we want to count the number of distinct pairwise products of elements from these subgroups. For each H_i, there are 2 non-identity elements, and for K, there are 8 non-identity elements. So, for each H_i, there are 2 * 8 = 16 pairwise products with K.\n\nSince there are 9 distinct H_i's, the total number of pairwise products is 9 * 16 = 144.\n\nHowever, we have counted the identity element multiple times. Each H_i contributes one identity element when multiplied by the inverse of its non-identity element in K. Since there are 9 H_i's, we have counted the identity element 9 times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct pairwise products is 144 - 9 + 1 = 136."
