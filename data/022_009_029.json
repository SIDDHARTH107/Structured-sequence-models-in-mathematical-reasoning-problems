    "message_2": "We are given the power series of the function f(z) = ∑(n=0 to infinity) z^n, and we need to find the sum of the first 10 terms at z = 0.5.\n\nThe first 10 terms of the power series are:\n\nf(z) = z^0 + z^1 + z^2 + z^3 + ... + z^9\n\nNow, we substitute z = 0.5 into the equation:\n\nf(0.5) = (0.5)^0 + (0.5)^1 + (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^3 + ... + (0.5)^9\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term a = 1 (since (0.5)^0 = 1), the common ratio r = 0.5, and the number of terms n = 10.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:\n\nS_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nS_10 = 1 * (1 - (0.5)^10) / (1 - 0.5)\n\nS_10 = (1 - (0.5)^10) / 0.5\n\nS_10 = (1 - 0.0009765625) / 0.5\n\nS_10 = 0.9990234375 / 0.5\n\nS_10 ≈ 1.998046875\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 terms of the power series at z = 0.5 is approximately 1.998046875."
