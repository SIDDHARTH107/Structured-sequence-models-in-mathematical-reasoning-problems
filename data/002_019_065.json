    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm? Use 3.14 for π and round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius, and l is the slant height of the cone. First, we need to find the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nl = √(r^2 + h^2)\n\nwhere h is the height of the cone. Plugging in the given values:\n\nl = √(5^2 + 10^2) = √(25 + 100) = √125 ≈ 11.18 cm\n\nNow, we can find the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 11.18) ≈ 3.14(5)(16.18) ≈ 254.34 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 254.34 cm², rounded to the nearest hundredth."
