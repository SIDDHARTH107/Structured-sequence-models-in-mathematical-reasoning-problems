    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 693 is divided by 7 using modular arithmetic, we can use the congruence relation:\n\n693 ≡ r (mod 7)\n\nwhere r is the remainder. We can rewrite the congruence relation as:\n\n693 = 7k + r\n\nwhere k is an integer. Now, we can divide 693 by 7:\n\n693 ÷ 7 = 99\n\nSo, 693 = 7 × 99, which means:\n\n693 = 7 × 99 + 0\n\nThus, the remainder r is 0, and the congruence relation becomes:\n\n693 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the remainder when 693 is divided by 7 is 0."
