    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, X and Y. The profit earned from one unit of X is $5 and from one unit of Y is $6. The factory has two machines, A and B. Machine A can manufacture 3 units of X or 2 units of Y in an hour, and machine B can manufacture 2 units of X or 2 units of Y in an hour. The factory has 20 hours of machine A's time and 10 hours of machine B's time available each day. How many units of each product should the factory produce per day to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of hours machine A spends on producing X as a_x and the number of hours machine A spends on producing Y as a_y. Similarly, let's denote the number of hours machine B spends on producing X as b_x and the number of hours machine B spends on producing Y as b_y.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. a_x + a_y <= 20 (total hours of machine A)\n2. b_x + b_y <= 10 (total hours of machine B)\n\nThe number of units produced for each product is:\n\nX = 3 * a_x + 2 * b_x\nY = 2 * a_y + 2 * b_y\n\nThe total profit is:\n\nProfit = 5 * X + 6 * Y\n\nOur goal is to maximize the profit while satisfying the constraints.\n\nLet's rewrite the profit function in terms of a_x, a_y, b_x, and b_y:\n\nProfit = 5 * (3 * a_x + 2 * b_x) + 6 * (2 * a_y + 2 * b_y)\nProfit = 15 * a_x + 10 * b_x + 12 * a_y + 12 * b_y\n\nNow we can use linear programming to solve this problem. We want to maximize the profit function subject to the constraints:\n\nMaximize: 15 * a_x + 10 * b_x + 12 * a_y + 12 * b_y\nSubject to:\n1. a_x + a_y <= 20\n2. b_x + b_y <= 10\n3. a_x, a_y, b_x, b_y >= 0 (non-negative hours)\n\nSolving this linear programming problem, we get the optimal solution:\n\na_x = 20, a_y = 0, b_x = 0, b_y = 10\n\nThis means machine A should spend all its 20 hours on producing X, and machine B should spend all its 10 hours on producing Y.\n\nThe number of units produced for each product is:\n\nX = 3 * a_x + 2 * b_x = 3 * 20 + 2 * 0 = 60\nY = 2 * a_y + 2 * b_y = 2 * 0 + 2 * 10 = 20\n\nSo, the factory should produce 60 units of product X and 20 units of product Y per day to maximize the profit."
