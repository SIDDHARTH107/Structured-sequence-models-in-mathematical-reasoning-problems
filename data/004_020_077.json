    "message_1": "A 1000 kg crate is lifted 10 meters vertically by a crane. The crane applies a constant force of 500 N. Find the work done by the crane in lifting the crate using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the crane in lifting the crate, we can use the formula for work:\n\nW = ∫(F * ds)\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force applied, and ds is the displacement.\n\nSince the force is constant (500 N) and the displacement is vertical (10 meters), we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nW = ∫(500 * ds) from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to ds:\n\nW = 500 * ∫(ds) from 0 to 10\n\nW = 500 * [s] from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = 500 * (10 - 0)\n\nW = 500 * 10\n\nW = 5000 J\n\nSo, the work done by the crane in lifting the crate is 5000 Joules."
