    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of production for a certain product. The production cost involves a fixed cost of $2000 and a variable cost of $10 per unit produced. The demand for the product follows a normal distribution with a mean of 1000 units and a standard deviation of 50 units. What should be the optimal production quantity to minimize the expected production cost? (Assume a selling price of $20 per unit)",
    "message_2": "To minimize the expected production cost, we need to find the optimal production quantity that balances the fixed cost, variable cost, and the expected revenue from selling the product. We can use the newsvendor model to find the optimal production quantity.\n\nThe newsvendor model is a classic operations research problem that deals with determining the optimal order quantity to minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of overstock (producing too much) and the cost of understock (producing too little).\n\nIn this problem, the overstock cost (Co) is the cost of producing one extra unit that is not sold, which is the variable cost of $10 per unit. The understock cost (Cu) is the cost of not producing one unit that could have been sold, which is the lost profit per unit, which is the selling price of $20 minus the variable cost of $10, so $10 per unit.\n\nThe critical fractile (F) is the ratio of the understock cost to the sum of the understock and overstock costs: F = Cu / (Cu + Co) = 10 / (10 + 10) = 0.5.\n\nNow, we need to find the production quantity (Q) that corresponds to the critical fractile in the demand distribution. Since the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 1000 units and a standard deviation of 50 units, we can use the inverse cumulative distribution function (also known as the quantile function) to find the production quantity that corresponds to the 0.5 fractile.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with the inverse cumulative distribution function, we find that the z-score corresponding to a 0.5 fractile is 0.\n\nNow, we can convert this z-score back to the production quantity using the mean and standard deviation of the demand distribution: Q = mean + z * standard deviation = 1000 + 0 * 50 = 1000.\n\nSo, the optimal production quantity to minimize the expected production cost is 1000 units."
