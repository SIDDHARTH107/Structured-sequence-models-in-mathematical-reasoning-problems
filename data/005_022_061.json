    "message_2": "To calculate the median, we first need to order the dataset from smallest to largest, which is already done in this case. Since there are 10 values in the dataset, the median will be the average of the 5th and 6th values.\n\nMedian = (30 + 35) / 2 = 32.5\n\nNow, to calculate the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), we need to find the absolute deviations from the median for each value in the dataset:\n\n|10 - 32.5| = 22.5\n|15 - 32.5| = 17.5\n|20 - 32.5| = 12.5\n|25 - 32.5| = 7.5\n|30 - 32.5| = 2.5\n|35 - 32.5| = 2.5\n|40 - 32.5| = 7.5\n|45 - 32.5| = 12.5\n|50 - 32.5| = 17.5\n|100 - 32.5| = 67.5\n\nNow, we need to find the median of these absolute deviations:\n\nOrdered absolute deviations: 2.5, 2.5, 7.5, 7.5, 12.5, 12.5, 17.5, 17.5, 22.5, 67.5\n\nMedian Absolute Deviation (MAD) = (12.5 + 12.5) / 2 = 12.5\n\nSo, the median for this dataset is 32.5, and the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is 12.5."
