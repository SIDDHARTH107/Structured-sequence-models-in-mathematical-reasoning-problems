    "message_2": "To find the smallest possible value of n, we can use the property of factorials and divisibility. We know that (n-1)! is the product of all positive integers from 1 to (n-1). Therefore, (n-1)! is divisible by all the integers from 1 to (n-1), and also by their multiples.\n\nNow, we are given that (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n. Since (n-1)! is divisible by all the integers from 1 to (n-1), adding 1 to (n-1)! will make it not divisible by any of those integers. Therefore, n must be a prime number, as prime numbers have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nLet's test the smallest prime numbers to find the smallest possible value of n:\n\nFor n = 2:\n(2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of n is 2."
