    "message_1": "What is the probability of a car accident happening on a specific curve of a road if statistical data shows that in the past year, out of 40 car accidents on that road, 12 of them occurred on that specific curve?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a car accident happening on a specific curve of a road, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of accidents on the curve) / (Total number of accidents on the road)\n\nIn this case, there were 12 accidents on the curve and 40 accidents on the road in total. So the probability is:\n\nProbability = 12 / 40\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n\nProbability = (12 / 4) / (40 / 4)\nProbability = 3 / 10\n\nSo, the probability of a car accident happening on that specific curve is 3/10 or 0.3, which is equivalent to a 30% chance."
