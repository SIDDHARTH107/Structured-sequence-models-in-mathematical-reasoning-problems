    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you are using elliptic curve cryptography to transmit a message over a curve with the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 5, and you have selected a base point P(3,4) with order 7. \nIf the private key is 4, what is the corresponding public key Q?",
    "message_2": "To find the public key Q, we need to compute the scalar multiplication of the private key (4) with the base point P(3,4). In other words, we need to find 4P.\n\nWe will use the point doubling and point addition formulas for elliptic curves. \n\nFirst, let's find 2P:\nFor point doubling, we use the formula:\nλ = (3x₁² + a) / 2y₁ (mod p) and x₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂ (mod p), y₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod p)\n\nHere, a = 2 (from the curve equation), x₁ = 3, y₁ = 4, and p is a large prime number (not given, but not needed for this calculation).\n\nλ = (3(3²) + 2) / (2(4)) = (27 + 2) / 8 = 29 / 8\nSince we are working with integers, we need to find the modular inverse of 8. Let's assume the large prime number is p. Then, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of 8 (mod p). Let's denote this inverse as inv_8.\n\nNow, λ = 29 * inv_8 (mod p)\n\nx₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂ (mod p) = (29 * inv_8)² - 3 - 3 (mod p) = 841 * inv_8² - 6 (mod p)\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod p) = 29 * inv_8 * (3 - (841 * inv_8² - 6)) - 4 (mod p)\n\nNow we have the coordinates of 2P as (841 * inv_8² - 6, 29 * inv_8 * (3 - (841 * inv_8² - 6)) - 4) (mod p).\n\nNext, we need to find 4P, which is 2(2P). We can use the same point doubling formula with the coordinates of 2P:\n\nx₁ = 841 * inv_8² - 6\ny₁ = 29 * inv_8 * (3 - (841 * inv_8² - 6)) - 4\n\nλ = (3x₁² + a) / 2y₁ (mod p) = (3(841 * inv_8² - 6)² + 2) / (2(29 * inv_8 * (3 - (841 * inv_8² - 6)) - 4)) (mod p)\n\nx₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂ (mod p)\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod p)\n\nThe coordinates of 4P will be (x₃, y₃) (mod p), which is the public key Q."
