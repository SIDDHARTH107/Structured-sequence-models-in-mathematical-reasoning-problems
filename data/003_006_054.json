    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we should first find the largest side, which is already given as 14 cm. The smallest angle will be opposite to the largest side. Now, we will use the Law of Cosines to find the angle opposite to the largest side.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C opposite to those sides respectively:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = 10 cm, b = 12 cm, and c = 14 cm. We want to find angle C.\n\n14² = 10² + 12² - 2 * 10 * 12 * cos(C)\n\n196 = 100 + 144 - 240 * cos(C)\n\n52 = -240 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = -52 / 240\n\ncos(C) ≈ -0.2167\n\nNow, we will use the inverse cosine function to find the angle C:\n\nC = arccos(-0.2167)\n\nC ≈ 102.52°\n\nNow that we have found the largest angle, we can use the Law of Sines to find the smallest angle. The Law of Sines states that:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe already know that side a is opposite to the smallest angle A. So, we can rearrange the formula to find angle A:\n\nsin(A) = a * sin(C) / c\n\nsin(A) = 10 * sin(102.52°) / 14\n\nsin(A) ≈ 0.3945\n\nNow, we will use the inverse sine function to find the angle A:\n\nA = arcsin(0.3945)\n\nA ≈ 23.27°\n\nSo, the measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 23.27°."
