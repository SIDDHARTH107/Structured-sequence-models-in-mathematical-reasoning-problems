Consider a vector field $X$ defined by $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} -y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ and a function $f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+z^2$. Determine the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$ at the point $p = (1,2,3)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to the vector field $X$, we need to apply the vector field $X$ to the function $f$. In other words, we need to compute the action of $X$ on $f$, which is given by the directional derivative of $f$ along $X$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - y \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$$\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $z$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 2z$$\n\nSubstitute these partial derivatives back into the expression for the Lie derivative:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = 2x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - y(2z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the Lie derivative at the point $p = (1, 2, 3)$. Substitute the coordinates of $p$ into the expression:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f(p) = 2(1) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - 2(3) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$$\n\nSince we are evaluating the Lie derivative at a specific point, we can drop the partial derivative notation and simply compute the result:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f(p) = 2 - 6 = -4$$\n\nThus, the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$ at the point $p = (1, 2, 3)$ is $-4$."
