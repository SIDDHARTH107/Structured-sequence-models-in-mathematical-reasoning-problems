    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1, we first need to find its first derivative and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. In this case, the quadratic formula is the most straightforward method:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 3, b = -6, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(3)(2))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 6\n\nx = (6 ± √12) / 6\n\nx = (6 ± 2√3) / 6\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by dividing both terms by 2:\n\nx = (3 ± √3) / 3\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1 are x = (3 + √3) / 3 and x = (3 - √3) / 3."
