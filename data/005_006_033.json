    "message_2": "To find the probability that the mean life of the light bulbs in the sample will be between 7900 and 8100 hours, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 8000 hours, the population standard deviation (σ) is 400 hours, and the sample size (n) is 100 bulbs.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 400 / √100 = 400 / 10 = 40 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the range (7900 and 8100 hours) using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower bound (7900 hours):\n\nz1 = (7900 - 8000) / 40 = -100 / 40 = -2.5\n\nFor the upper bound (8100 hours):\n\nz2 = (8100 - 8000) / 40 = 100 / 40 = 2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean falls between these z-scores. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(-2.5 < z < 2.5) = P(z < 2.5) - P(z < -2.5)\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator:\n\nP(z < 2.5) ≈ 0.9938\nP(z < -2.5) ≈ 0.0062\n\nP(-2.5 < z < 2.5) = 0.9938 - 0.0062 = 0.9876\n\nSo, the probability that the mean life of the light bulbs in the sample will be between 7900 and 8100 hours is approximately 0.9876 or 98.76%."
