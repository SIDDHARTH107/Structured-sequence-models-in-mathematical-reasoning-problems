    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product of two vectors v1 and v2 is given by:\n\nv1 · v2 = |v1| |v2| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |v1| and |v2| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nv1 · v2 = (3)(-2) + (4)(6) = -6 + 24 = 18\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|v1| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v2| = √((-2)² + 6²) = √(4 + 36) = √40 = 2√10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n18 = (5)(2√10) cos(θ)\ncos(θ) = 18 / (10√10)\ncos(θ) = 9 / (5√10)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nθ = arccos(9 / (5√10))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 0.876 radians or ≈ 50.19 degrees"
