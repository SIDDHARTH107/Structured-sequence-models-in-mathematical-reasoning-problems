    "message_2": "The intersection of a set A and its complement B is the set of elements that are common to both A and B. By definition, the complement of a set A contains all the elements that are not in A. Therefore, there are no elements that are common to both A and its complement B. \n\nHence, the intersection of set A and its complement B is an empty set, denoted as âˆ… or {}."
