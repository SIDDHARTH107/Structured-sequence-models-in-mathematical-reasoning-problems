    "message_2": "The given curve $C$ is a plane algebraic curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6$. To compute the Hodge numbers $h^{1,0}(C)$ and $h^{2,0}(C)$, we first need to determine the genus $g$ of the curve.\n\nThe curve is a cubic curve (since the highest degree term is $x^3$), and we can compute its genus using the formula for a plane curve of degree $d$:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$\n\nIn our case, $d = 3$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$\n\nNow we can use the Hodge diamond for a smooth projective curve of genus $g$:\n\n$\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n & & h^{0,0} & & \\\\\n & h^{1,0} & & h^{0,1} & \\\\\nh^{2,0} & & h^{1,1} & & h^{0,2} \\\\\n & h^{2,1} & & h^{1,2} & \\\\\n & & h^{2,2} & & \\\\\n\\end{array}$\n\nFor a curve of genus $g$, the Hodge diamond is:\n\n$\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n & & 1 & & \\\\\n & g & & g & \\\\\n1 & & 2g-2 & & 1 \\\\\n & g & & g & \\\\\n & & 1 & & \\\\\n\\end{array}$\n\nIn our case, $g = 1$, so the Hodge diamond is:\n\n$\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n & & 1 & & \\\\\n & 1 & & 1 & \\\\\n1 & & 0 & & 1 \\\\\n & 1 & & 1 & \\\\\n & & 1 & & \\\\\n\\end{array}$\n\nThus, we have $h^{1,0}(C) = 1$ and $h^{2,0}(C) = 1$."
