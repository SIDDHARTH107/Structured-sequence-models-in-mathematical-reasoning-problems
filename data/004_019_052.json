    "message_2": "To find the car's acceleration, we can use the formula for acceleration, which is the change in velocity divided by the change in time. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial and final velocities from miles per hour to feet per second, since we are given the time in seconds. \n\n1 mile = 5280 feet\n1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\nInitial velocity (v1) = 50 miles per hour * (5280 feet / 1 mile) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 73.33 feet per second (approximately)\n\nFinal velocity (v2) = 68 miles per hour * (5280 feet / 1 mile) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 99.73 feet per second (approximately)\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration (a) using the formula:\n\na = (v2 - v1) / t\n\nwhere t is the time interval (3 seconds).\n\na = (99.73 - 73.33) / 3 = 26.4 / 3 = 8.8 feet per second squared\n\nSo, the car's acceleration during this time period is approximately 8.8 feet per second squared."
