    "message_2": "To find the LCM of 12, 20, and 30, we can use the prime factorization method. \n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each number:\n\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n20 = 2^2 * 5\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n\nNow, for each unique prime factor, take the highest power that appears in any of the factorizations and multiply them together:\n\nLCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60\n\nSo, the least common multiple of 12, 20, and 30 is 60."
