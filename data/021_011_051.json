    "message_2": "The conjugate gradient method is typically used for solving large systems of linear equations, and it is not the most suitable method for this optimization problem. Instead, we can use calculus to find the minimum of the cost function C(x).\n\nTo find the minimum of the function C(x), we first need to find its critical points. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. In this case, we will find the derivative of C(x) and set it equal to zero:\n\nC(x) = 3x^2 - 36x + 100\nC'(x) = dC(x)/dx = 6x - 36\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x - 36 = 0\n6x = 36\nx = 6\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum or maximum. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative of C(x):\n\nC''(x) = d^2C(x)/dx^2 = 6\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, the critical point x = 6 is a minimum. Therefore, the value of x that minimizes the total cost is x = 6."
