    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves in the complex plane is equal to the product of their degrees, provided that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are counted with their multiplicities.\n\nThe degree of the first equation, $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 10 = 0$, is 2, since the highest power of any variable is 2.\n\nThe degree of the second equation, $g(x, y) = xy - 3 = 0$, is also 2, since the highest power of any variable is 1, but the product of the variables has a total degree of 2.\n\nSince the two equations have no common components, we can apply Bezout's theorem. The number of solutions for the system of equations in the complex plane is the product of their degrees:\n\nNumber of solutions = degree of f(x, y) × degree of g(x, y) = 2 × 2 = 4\n\nTherefore, there are 4 solutions for the system of equations $f(x, y) = 0$ and $g(x, y) = 0$ in the complex plane."
