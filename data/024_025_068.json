    "message_1": "Consider a complex manifold $M$ of complex dimension 2. Let $L$ be a complex line bundle over $M$ such that the first Chern class of $L$ is given by $c_1(L) = 4a + 3b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the generators of $H^2(M;\\mathbb{Z})$ and satisfy $a^2 = b^2 = 0$ and $ab = ba$. Find the second and third Chern classes of $L$.",
    "message_2": "Since $L$ is a complex line bundle, its total Chern class is given by $c(L) = 1 + c_1(L)$. We are given that $c_1(L) = 4a + 3b$. The second and third Chern classes, $c_2(L)$ and $c_3(L)$, can be found by expanding the total Chern class in terms of the generators $a$ and $b$.\n\nHowever, since $M$ has complex dimension 2, its cohomology groups in dimensions higher than 2 are trivial. In particular, $H^4(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = H^6(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Therefore, the second and third Chern classes of $L$ must be zero:\n\n$$c_2(L) = 0$$\n$$c_3(L) = 0$$\n\nSo, the second and third Chern classes of the complex line bundle $L$ are both zero."
