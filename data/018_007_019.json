    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in the power set P(A) of a set A with n elements, we need to consider that each element in A can either be included or not included in a subset. This gives us 2 choices for each element. Since there are n elements in A, there are 2^n possible combinations of these choices, which is the number of elements in the power set P(A).\n\nNow, let's show that 2^n is always greater than n. We can use induction to prove this.\n\nBase case: n = 1\n2^1 = 2, which is greater than 1.\n\nInductive step: Assume that 2^k > k for some positive integer k. We want to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1).\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k (by the properties of exponents)\nSince 2^k > k (by the inductive hypothesis), we have:\n2 * 2^k > 2 * k\n\nNow, we need to show that 2 * k > k + 1. This is equivalent to showing that k > 1. Since our induction starts at k = 1, this is true for all k in our induction.\n\nThus, 2^(k+1) > (k+1), and by induction, 2^n is always greater than n for all positive integers n.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the power set P(A) is 2^n, and it is always greater than n."
