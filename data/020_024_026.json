    "message_1": "A bookstore wants to determine the optimal selling price for a textbook that cost them $50 to purchase. They estimate that the demand for the book can be modeled by the equation Q = 100 - 0.5P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the selling price. The store's fixed costs are $1000, and they have variable costs of $10 per textbook sold. What selling price should the bookstore set to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we first need to find the revenue function and the cost function, and then find the profit function by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function. Finally, we'll find the selling price that maximizes the profit function.\n\n1. Revenue function:\nRevenue = Price × Quantity\nR(P) = P × Q\nSince Q = 100 - 0.5P, we can substitute this into the revenue function:\nR(P) = P × (100 - 0.5P)\n\n2. Cost function:\nCost = Fixed costs + Variable costs\nC(Q) = 1000 + 10Q\nSince Q = 100 - 0.5P, we can substitute this into the cost function:\nC(P) = 1000 + 10(100 - 0.5P)\n\n3. Profit function:\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nΠ(P) = R(P) - C(P)\nΠ(P) = P(100 - 0.5P) - (1000 + 10(100 - 0.5P))\n\nNow, we'll find the first derivative of the profit function with respect to P and set it to zero to find the critical points:\n\nΠ'(P) = d(Π(P))/dP\n\nUsing the product rule and the chain rule, we get:\n\nΠ'(P) = (100 - 0.5P) - P(0.5) - 10(0.5)\nΠ'(P) = 100 - 0.5P - 0.5P - 5\nΠ'(P) = 95 - P\n\nNow, we set the first derivative to zero and solve for P:\n\n95 - P = 0\nP = 95\n\nSo, the optimal selling price to maximize profit is $95."
