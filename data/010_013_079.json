    "message_1": "Suppose $E \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a vector bundle over $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where for each point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the fiber $E_{(x,y)}$ is a two-dimensional vector space. Let $s$ be a section of $E$ given by $s(x,y) = (x^2 + y^2-1, x+y)$. Find the zero set of $s$, that is, the set of all points $(x,y)$ such that $s(x,y) = 0$ in $E_{(x,y)}$.",
    "message_2": "To find the zero set of the section $s$, we need to find all points $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $s(x, y) = (0, 0)$ in $E_{(x, y)}$. This means we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n1. $x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$\n2. $x + y = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we have $y = -x$. Now, substitute this into equation (1):\n\n$x^2 + (-x)^2 - 1 = 0$\n$2x^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nNow, using the relation $y = -x$, we find the corresponding $y$ values:\n\nFor $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $y = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\nFor $x = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThus, the zero set of $s$ is the set of points $\\left\\{ \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\right\\}$."
