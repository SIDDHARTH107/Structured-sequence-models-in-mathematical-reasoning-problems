    "message_2": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} be a set. The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Since we don't have a specific universal set defined, we can represent A' as the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection of A and A', denoted as A ∩ A'. By definition, the intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nLet x be an element in A ∩ A'. This means that x is in both A and A'. However, this leads to a contradiction, because if x is in A, it cannot be in A' (since A' contains elements not in A), and if x is in A', it cannot be in A.\n\nTherefore, there are no elements that can belong to both A and A', which means that the intersection of A and A' is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nThus, A ∩ A' = ∅."
