    "message_1": "A construction company built 10 houses using only two types of materials: bricks and cement blocks. If the company used twice as many bricks as cement blocks to build the 10 houses, how many cement blocks were used in total?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of cement blocks used as x. Since the company used twice as many bricks as cement blocks, the number of bricks used would be 2x. The total number of materials used to build the 10 houses is the sum of bricks and cement blocks, which is x + 2x.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to determine the exact number of cement blocks used. We need more information about the total number of materials used or the proportion of bricks and cement blocks used in each house."
