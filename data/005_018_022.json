    "message_2": "To calculate the survival rate, we need to find the percentage of patients who survived after the 3-year follow-up period.\n\nTotal number of patients = 100\nNumber of patients who died = 20\n\nNumber of patients who survived = Total number of patients - Number of patients who died\nNumber of patients who survived = 100 - 20 = 80\n\nNow, we'll find the survival rate as a percentage:\n\nSurvival rate = (Number of patients who survived / Total number of patients) * 100\nSurvival rate = (80 / 100) * 100\nSurvival rate = 0.8 * 100\nSurvival rate = 80%\n\nThe survival rate of the patients after 3 years is 80%."
