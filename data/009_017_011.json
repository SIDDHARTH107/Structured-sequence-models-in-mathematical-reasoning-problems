The loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.2 T in the positive z direction. Use Maxwell's equations to find the induced emf and the direction of the induced current if the loop is moved with a constant speed of 2 m/s in the positive x direction. Assume the resistance of the wire is 5 Ω.\n\n    +y\n    ^\n    |\n    |     +-----+\n    |     |     |\n    |     |  o  |\n    |     |     |\n    |     +-----+\n    |----------->\n           +x \n\n(Symbols: o = center of the loop, T = Tesla, Ω = ohm)\n\nNote: To solve this problem, the student needs to understand how to use Faraday's Law (one of the Maxwell's equations) to calculate the emf induced in the loop, and then apply Ohm's Law to determine the induced current. The direction of the induced current can be determined using Lenz's Law, which is a consequence of the conservation of energy.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Faraday's Law, which states that the induced electromotive force (emf) in a closed loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nemf = -dΦ/dt\n\nwhere Φ is the magnetic flux and t is time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnetic flux through the loop. The magnetic flux is given by:\n\nΦ = B * A * cos(θ)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, A is the area of the loop, and θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal vector to the loop. In this case, the magnetic field is in the positive z direction, and the normal vector to the loop is also in the positive z direction, so θ = 0° and cos(θ) = 1.\n\nThe area of the loop is given by:\n\nA = length * width = (5 cm * 10 cm) = 50 cm² = 0.0050 m² (converted to square meters)\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic flux:\n\nΦ = B * A * cos(θ) = (0.2 T) * (0.0050 m²) * 1 = 0.0010 Tm²\n\nNext, we need to find the rate of change of the magnetic flux with respect to time. Since the loop is moving with a constant speed of 2 m/s in the positive x direction, the width of the loop exposed to the magnetic field is decreasing at a rate of 2 m/s. Therefore, the rate of change of the area exposed to the magnetic field is:\n\ndA/dt = -width * speed = -(0.10 m) * (2 m/s) = -0.20 m²/s\n\nNow we can find the rate of change of the magnetic flux:\n\ndΦ/dt = B * (dA/dt) * cos(θ) = (0.2 T) * (-0.20 m²/s) * 1 = -0.040 Tm²/s\n\nUsing Faraday's Law, we can now calculate the induced emf:\n\nemf = -dΦ/dt = 0.040 V (since the negative sign indicates direction, we take the magnitude)\n\nNow that we have the induced emf, we can use Ohm's Law to find the induced current:\n\nI = emf / R = 0.040 V / 5 Ω = 0.008 A\n\nFinally, we need to determine the direction of the induced current. According to Lenz's Law, the induced current will flow in such a way as to oppose the change in magnetic flux. Since the magnetic field is in the positive z direction and the loop is moving in the positive x direction, the induced current will flow in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from the positive z direction.\n\nIn summary, the induced emf is 0.040 V, the induced current is 0.008 A, and the direction of the induced current is counterclockwise when viewed from the positive z direction."
