    "message_2": "The Hopf map is a mapping from the three-dimensional sphere $S^3$ to the two-dimensional sphere $S^2$. It is given by the formula:\n\n$$\\Phi: S^3 \\to S^2$$\n$$(z_1, z_2) \\mapsto (z_1^2 - z_2^2, 2z_1z_2, z_1^2 + z_2^2)$$\n\nwhere $(z_1, z_2) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2$ and $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$ (since we are considering points on the three-dimensional sphere $S^3$).\n\nTo determine the image of the sphere under this mapping, we need to find the set of points $(x, y, z) \\in S^2$ that can be obtained by applying the Hopf map to points on $S^3$. In other words, we need to find the set of points $(x, y, z)$ such that:\n\n$$x = z_1^2 - z_2^2$$\n$$y = 2z_1z_2$$\n$$z = z_1^2 + z_2^2$$\n\nwith $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of the magnitudes of $z_1$ and $z_2$:\n\n$$x = |z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2$$\n$$y = 2|z_1||z_2|$$\n$$z = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2$$\n\nNow, since $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$, we can rewrite the expression for $z$ as:\n\n$$z = 1$$\n\nThis means that the image of the sphere under the Hopf map is a subset of the plane $z = 1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. To find the exact shape of this subset, we can eliminate $|z_1|^2$ and $|z_2|^2$ from the expressions for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$x = 1 - 2|z_2|^2$$\n$$y = 2|z_1||z_2|$$\n\nSquaring both equations and adding them, we get:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 = (1 - 2|z_2|^2)^2 + (2|z_1||z_2|)^2$$\n\nNow, substituting $|z_1|^2 = 1 - |z_2|^2$, we get:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 = (1 - 2|z_2|^2)^2 + (2(1 - |z_2|^2)|z_2|)^2$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we obtain:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$\n\nThis is the equation of a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin in the $xy$-plane. Therefore, the image of the sphere under the Hopf map is a circle of radius 1 in the plane $z = 1$."
