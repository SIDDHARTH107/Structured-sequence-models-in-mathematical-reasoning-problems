    "message_1": "A chemical reaction is taking place in a reactor, and the rate of change of concentration of a chemical species A is given by the differential equation: \n\nd[A]/dt = k[A]^2\n\nwhere [A] is the concentration of A and k is the rate constant. If the initial concentration of A is 0.1 moles/L and k is 0.02 L/mol.s, solve for [A] at t=10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation:\n\nd[A]/dt = k[A]^2\n\nFirst, we separate the variables:\n\nd[A]/[A]^2 = k dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫ d[A]/[A]^2 = ∫ k dt\n\nThe left side is the integral of 1/[A]^2 with respect to [A], which is -1/[A]. The right side is the integral of k with respect to t, which is kt. We also need to add the integration constants, C1 and C2, to both sides:\n\n-1/[A] + C1 = kt + C2\n\nNow, we use the initial conditions to find the constants. At t = 0, [A] = 0.1 moles/L:\n\n-1/0.1 + C1 = 0.02 * 0 + C2\n\nC1 - 10 = C2\n\nNow, we need to find [A] at t = 10 seconds. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n-1/[A] = kt - 10\n\nSubstitute the given values of k and t:\n\n-1/[A] = 0.02 * 10 - 10\n\n-1/[A] = 0.2 - 10\n\n-1/[A] = -9.8\n\nNow, we solve for [A]:\n\n[A] = -1/(-9.8) = 1/9.8 = 0.10204 moles/L\n\nSo, the concentration of A at t = 10 seconds is approximately 0.10204 moles/L."
