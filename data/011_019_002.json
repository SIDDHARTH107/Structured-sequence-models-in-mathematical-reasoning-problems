    "message_1": "A company wants to test four different factors, each with three levels, to determine the best settings for their product. They decide to use a 3-level Orthogonal Array to reduce the number of required tests. \n\nHow many tests will the company need to conduct to cover all possible combinations of factor settings using this Orthogonal Array?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of tests required for a 3-level orthogonal array with four factors, we need to find the smallest orthogonal array that can accommodate these factors and levels. In this case, the smallest orthogonal array is the L9 orthogonal array.\n\nAn L9 orthogonal array has 9 rows (tests) and can accommodate up to four 3-level factors. Therefore, the company will need to conduct 9 tests to cover all possible combinations of factor settings using this orthogonal array."
