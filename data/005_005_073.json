    "message_1": "Suppose the length of time it takes a student to complete a math quiz is normally distributed with a mean of 45 minutes and a standard deviation of 8 minutes. What is the probability that a randomly selected student will complete the quiz within 30 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student will complete the quiz within 30 minutes, we need to find the z-score for 30 minutes and then find the area to the left of that z-score on the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (30 minutes), μ is the mean (45 minutes), and σ is the standard deviation (8 minutes).\n\nz = (30 - 45) / 8\nz = -15 / 8\nz = -1.875\n\nNow, we need to find the area to the left of the z-score -1.875 in the standard normal distribution table. You can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of -1.875 is approximately 0.0307.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student will complete the quiz within 30 minutes is approximately 0.0307, or 3.07%."
