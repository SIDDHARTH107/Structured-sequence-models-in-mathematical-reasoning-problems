    "message_1": "A company wants to encrypt a message using a transposition cipher. The message contains 72 characters. The company chooses a columnar transposition cipher with key length 8. What is the number of rows in the transposition table needed to encrypt this message using this key length?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of rows needed for the transposition table, we need to divide the total number of characters in the message by the key length.\n\nNumber of characters = 72\nKey length = 8\n\nNumber of rows = 72 / 8 = 9\n\nSo, the company needs 9 rows in the transposition table to encrypt the message using the columnar transposition cipher with a key length of 8."
