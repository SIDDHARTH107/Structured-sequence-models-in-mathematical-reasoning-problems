    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a problem for a math student to solve:\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 1, find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2.",
    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe function is f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 1.\n\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3) - d/dx (4x) + d/dx (1)\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 4\nf'(2) = 3(4) - 4\nf'(2) = 12 - 4\nf'(2) = 8\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 8."
