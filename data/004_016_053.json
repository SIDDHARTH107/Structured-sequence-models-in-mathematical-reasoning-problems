    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, we have a car traveling from point A to point B, covering a distance of 200 km in 4 hours. Let's denote the position function of the car as s(t), where s(t) represents the distance traveled by the car at time t.\n\nThe average speed of the car over the entire trip is given by the total distance divided by the total time:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time) = 200 km / 4 hours = 50 km/hr\n\nNow, according to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a time c in the interval (0, 4) such that the instantaneous speed of the car at time c is equal to the average speed:\n\ns'(c) = 50 km/hr\n\nWe are asked to find the time when the car was traveling at a speed of 60 km/hr. Since the instantaneous speed of the car at time c is equal to the average speed, we can set up the following equation:\n\ns'(c) = 60 km/hr\n\nHowever, this equation contradicts the information given by the Mean Value Theorem, which states that s'(c) = 50 km/hr. Therefore, there is no time in which the car was traveling at a speed of 60 km/hr according to the Mean Value Theorem."
