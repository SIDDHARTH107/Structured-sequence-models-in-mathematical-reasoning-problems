    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 16, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of these groups.\n\nFirst, note that 16 = 2^4, so any group of order 16 is a p-group with p = 2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 16 must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Since 16 is a power of 2, there must be exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which means that any group of order 16 is a 2-group.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible structures of 2-groups of order 16. There are five possible structures:\n\n1. Cyclic group: There is exactly one cyclic group of order 16, denoted by C_16. This group has a unique element of order 16, and all other non-identity elements have orders that are powers of 2.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4: There is exactly one such group, denoted by C_4 × C_4. This group has three elements of order 4 and twelve elements of order 2.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2: There is exactly one such group, denoted by C_8 × C_2. This group has one element of order 8, two elements of order 4, and twelve elements of order 2.\n\n4. Quaternion group: There is exactly one quaternion group of order 16, denoted by Q_16. This group has one element of order 8, six elements of order 4, and eight elements of order 2.\n\n5. Dihedral group: There is exactly one dihedral group of order 16, denoted by D_16. This group has two elements of order 8, four elements of order 4, and eight elements of order 2.\n\nWe can see that any two groups of the same isomorphism class have the same structure, as they have the same number of elements of each order. Furthermore, there are different structures for groups of different isomorphism classes, as the number of elements of each order varies between the classes.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 16."
