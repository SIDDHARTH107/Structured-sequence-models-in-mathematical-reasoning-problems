    "message_2": "To find the periodic solutions of the Duffing oscillator, we first rewrite the given second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations. Let $y = x'$, then we have:\n\n$x' = y$\n$y' = -0.1y - x - x^3$\n\nwith initial conditions $x(0) = 0.1$ and $y(0) = 0$.\n\nNow, we can analyze the system of first-order differential equations. The periodic solutions of the Duffing oscillator are not expressible in terms of elementary functions, so we need to use numerical methods to find them.\n\nOne common approach is to use a numerical solver like the Runge-Kutta method to integrate the system of equations and find the trajectory of the system in the phase space (x, y). Then, we can analyze the trajectory to find periodic solutions.\n\nHere's a Python code using the Runge-Kutta method to solve the Duffing oscillator:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef duffing_oscillator(t, X):\n    x, y = X\n    dxdt = y\n    dydt = -0.1 * y - x - x**3\n    return np.array([dxdt, dydt])\n\ndef runge_kutta_step(f, t, X, h):\n    k1 = h * f(t, X)\n    k2 = h * f(t + h/2, X + k1/2)\n    k3 = h * f(t + h/2, X + k2/2)\n    k4 = h * f(t + h, X + k3)\n    return X + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n\nt0, tf, h = 0, 100, 0.01\nt = np.arange(t0, tf, h)\nX0 = np.array([0.1, 0])\n\nX = np.zeros((len(t), 2))\nX[0] = X0\n\nfor i in range(1, len(t)):\n    X[i] = runge_kutta_step(duffing_oscillator, t[i-1], X[i-1], h)\n\nx, y = X[:, 0], X[:, 1]\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel(\"x'\")\nplt.title('Phase space trajectory of the Duffing oscillator')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nRunning this code will generate a plot of the phase space trajectory of the Duffing oscillator. The periodic solutions correspond to closed orbits in the phase space. Note that the Duffing oscillator can exhibit chaotic behavior for certain parameter values, so the trajectory may not be perfectly periodic. However, this code should give you a good starting point for analyzing the periodic solutions of the Duffing oscillator."
