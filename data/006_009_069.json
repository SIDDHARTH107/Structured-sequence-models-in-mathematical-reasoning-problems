    "message_1": "If the probability of a person having a certain medical condition is 0.2, and a doctor sees 50 patients with similar symptoms, what is the probability that at least 10 people in that group have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, patients with the medical condition) in n trials (in this case, 50 patients)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.2)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 50 patients)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 10 patients with the medical condition)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 10 people having the medical condition, we need to find the probability of 10, 11, 12, ..., 50 people having the condition and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the complementary probability (i.e., the probability of 0 to 9 people having the condition) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we'll calculate the probability of 0 to 9 people having the condition and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.2)^k * (0.8)^(50-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of at least 10 people having the condition:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum and subtract it from 1, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) ≈ 0.9599\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 people in the group of 50 patients have the medical condition is approximately 0.9599 or 95.99%."
