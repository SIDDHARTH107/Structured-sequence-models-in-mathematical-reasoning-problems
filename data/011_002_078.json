(Hint: Use the binomial coefficient formula, also known as \"n choose k\", where n is the total number of students and k is the number of students being chosen for the team)",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different teams that can be formed, we will use the binomial coefficient formula, also known as \"n choose k\". In this case, n = 5 (total number of students) and k = 3 (number of students being chosen for the team).\n\nThe formula for \"n choose k\" is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, for our problem:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\n\nC(5, 3) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 × 2)\n\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nTherefore, 10 different teams can be formed from a group of 5 students."
