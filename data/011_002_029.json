    "message_2": "To find the number of different combinations of 4 letters from the word \"MATHS,\" we will use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 5 letters), k is the number of items to be chosen (4 letters), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!)\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4!1!)\n\nC(5, 4) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(1))\n\nC(5, 4) = 120 / (24 × 1)\n\nC(5, 4) = 120 / 24\n\nC(5, 4) = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 different combinations of 4 letters that can be chosen from the word \"MATHS.\""
