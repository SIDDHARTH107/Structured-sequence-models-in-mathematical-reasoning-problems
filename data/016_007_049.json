    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube along with the 6 cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed, leaving 20 cubes.\n\nFor a level-3 Menger sponge, this process is repeated three times. Here's the breakdown of the number of cubes at each level:\n\nLevel 1: 20 cubes (Initial 27 cubes - 7 removed)\nLevel 2: 20^2 = 400 cubes (Each of the 20 cubes from Level 1 is replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\nLevel 3: 20^3 = 8,000 cubes (Each of the 400 cubes from Level 2 is replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\n\nSo, a level-3 Menger sponge has a total of 8,000 cubes."
