    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to non-monotonic logic:\n\nSuppose a reasoning system uses non-monotonic logic to make inferences based on a set of rules. The system has the following rules:\n\n1. If it is raining, the grass will be wet.\n2. If someone is mowing the lawn, the grass will be dry.\n3. If the grass is wet, there must have been rain.\n\nIf the reasoning system starts with the statement \"It is not raining,\" what can it infer about the state of the grass?",
    "message_2": "Given the statement \"It is not raining,\" we can analyze the rules to infer the state of the grass:\n\n1. Since it is not raining, Rule 1 does not apply, and we cannot conclude that the grass is wet based on this rule.\n\n2. Rule 2 does not provide any information about the grass's state when no one is mowing the lawn. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the state of the grass based on this rule.\n\n3. Rule 3 states that if the grass is wet, there must have been rain. However, since it is not raining, we cannot infer anything about the state of the grass based on this rule.\n\nIn conclusion, with the given statement \"It is not raining\" and the provided rules, the reasoning system cannot infer the state of the grass. It could be either wet or dry, depending on other factors not covered by the rules."
