    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we can use the fact that 32 = 2^5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 32 must divide the order of the group (32) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. However, since the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must be congruent to 1 modulo 2, the only possibilities are 1 and 32.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it is normal, and the group is a direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and a group of order 1, which is just the Sylow 2-subgroup itself. In this case, the group is a 2-group, and we can use the classification of finite abelian groups to determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32.\n\nThe classification of finite abelian groups states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In the case of order 32, this means that the group is a direct product of cyclic groups of order 2, 4, 8, or 16. There are five possibilities for the group structure:\n\n1. C_32 (cyclic group of order 32)\n2. C_16 x C_2\n3. C_8 x C_4\n4. C_8 x C_2 x C_2\n5. C_4 x C_4 x C_2\n\nThese are all non-isomorphic abelian groups of order 32.\n\nNow, we need to consider the case where there are 32 Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, the group is non-abelian. It turns out that there are exactly two non-abelian groups of order 32: the dihedral group D_16 (the group of symmetries of a regular 16-gon) and the quaternion group Q_32.\n\nSo, in total, there are 5 abelian groups and 2 non-abelian groups, making a total of 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
