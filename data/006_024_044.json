    "message_2": "To find the probability of encountering traffic congestion at least once, we can first find the probability of not encountering traffic congestion at all and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of not encountering traffic congestion is 0.7 (since 1 - 0.3 = 0.7).\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of not encountering traffic congestion during the entire trip. Since there is only one trip, the probability remains the same, which is 0.7.\n\nFinally, to find the probability of encountering traffic congestion at least once, we subtract the probability of not encountering traffic congestion from 1:\n\n1 - 0.7 = 0.3\n\nSo, the probability of encountering traffic congestion at least once during their trip is 0.3 or 30%."
