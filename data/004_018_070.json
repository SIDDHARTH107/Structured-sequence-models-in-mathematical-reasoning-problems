    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^6 using the power rule, we need to apply the rule which states that if f(x) = ax^n, then f'(x) = n*ax^(n-1).\n\nIn this case, a = 3 and n = 6. So, applying the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = 6 * 3x^(6-1)\nf'(x) = 18x^5\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^6 is f'(x) = 18x^5."
