    "message_2": "A simplicial complex is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Every face of a simplex in the complex is also in the complex.\n2. The intersection of any two simplices in the complex is a face of both of them.\n\nIn this problem, we have three triangles: ABC, ABD, and ABE. Let's list all the faces of these triangles:\n\n0-dimensional faces (vertices): A, B, C, D, E\n1-dimensional faces (edges): AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE\n2-dimensional faces (triangles): ABC, ABD, ABE\n\nNow, let's count the faces:\n\n- 0-dimensional faces: 5 (A, B, C, D, E)\n- 1-dimensional faces: 7 (AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE)\n- 2-dimensional faces: 3 (ABC, ABD, ABE)\n\nSo, the simplicial complex formed by triangles ABC, ABD, and ABE has a total of 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 faces."
