    "message_2": "The cyclic group of prime order 7 is denoted as Z_7 or C_7. It consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} with addition modulo 7 as the group operation. In other words, the group is generated by the element 1, and every other element in the group can be obtained by repeatedly adding 1 to itself modulo 7.\n\nTo prove that it is the only group of order 7, we will use the fact that any group of prime order p is cyclic and isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p. This is a consequence of Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group G divides the order of G.\n\nLet G be a group of order 7, and let x be an element of G such that x ≠ e (the identity element). Since the order of G is prime, the order of the subgroup generated by x, denoted as ⟨x⟩, must either be 1 or 7. If the order of ⟨x⟩ is 1, then x = e, which contradicts our assumption that x ≠ e. Therefore, the order of ⟨x⟩ must be 7.\n\nSince ⟨x⟩ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, it follows that ⟨x⟩ = G. This means that G is a cyclic group generated by x, and thus G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 7, Z_7 or C_7.\n\nIn conclusion, the cyclic group of prime order 7 is Z_7 or C_7, and it is the only group of order 7."
