    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + cos(x) = 0, we can use the following substitution:\n\nLet y = sin(x), then cos(x) = √(1 - y^2) (from the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1).\n\nNow, substitute y and √(1 - y^2) into the equation:\n\n2y + √(1 - y^2) = 0\n\nNow, isolate the square root term:\n\n√(1 - y^2) = -2y\n\nSquare both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n1 - y^2 = 4y^2\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n5y^2 = 1\n\nDivide by 5:\n\ny^2 = 1/5\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\ny = ±√(1/5)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that satisfy y = sin(x) for both positive and negative square roots:\n\nFor y = √(1/5):\n\nx = arcsin(√(1/5))\n\nFor y = -√(1/5):\n\nx = arcsin(-√(1/5))\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π:\n\nFor x = arcsin(√(1/5)):\n\nx ≈ 0.46365 (in radians)\n\nFor x = arcsin(-√(1/5)):\n\nx ≈ -0.46365 (in radians)\n\nHowever, since x must be in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, we need to find the equivalent positive angle for x ≈ -0.46365:\n\nx ≈ 2π - 0.46365 ≈ 5.81994 (in radians)\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π are:\n\nx ≈ 0.46365 and x ≈ 5.81994 (in radians)."
