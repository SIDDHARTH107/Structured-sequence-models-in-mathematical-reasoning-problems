    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge).\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nEdges: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}, {5,6}\n\nNow, let's find the largest complete subgraph:\n\n1. The subgraph with vertices {1, 2, 3} is complete since all pairs of vertices are connected: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}.\n2. The subgraph with vertices {2, 3, 4} is also complete since all pairs of vertices are connected: {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}.\n3. There are no complete subgraphs with 4 or more vertices.\n\nTherefore, the largest complete subgraph has 3 vertices, and the clique number of this graph is 3."
