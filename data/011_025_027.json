    "message_1": "In a combinatorial game, two players take turns removing exactly 1 or 2 stones from a pile. The player who removes the last stone wins. \n\nIf there is a starting pile of 7 stones, who has the winning strategy?",
    "message_2": "The first player has the winning strategy. \n\nHere's the reasoning: \n1. If the first player takes 1 stone, there will be 6 stones left. No matter if the second player takes 1 or 2 stones, the remaining stones will be a multiple of 3 (either 5 or 4). \n2. The first player can then ensure that after their turn, the remaining stones will always be a multiple of 3. For example, if the second player took 1 stone (leaving 5), the first player can take 2 stones to leave 3 stones. If the second player took 2 stones (leaving 4), the first player can take 1 stone to leave 3 stones.\n3. When there are 3 stones left, the second player has no choice but to leave at least 1 stone for the first player, who will then take the last stone and win the game."
