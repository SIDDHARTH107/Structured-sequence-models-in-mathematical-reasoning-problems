    "message_2": "To find the integral of sin^3(x) dx, we can use the reduction formula for sin^n(x) and then integrate by parts. First, let's rewrite sin^3(x) as sin^2(x) * sin(x):\n\n∫sin^3(x) dx = ∫sin^2(x) * sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x) to rewrite the integral:\n\n∫sin^3(x) dx = ∫(1 - cos^2(x)) * sin(x) dx\n\nNext, we'll integrate by parts. Let u = 1 - cos^2(x) and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, du = 2cos(x)sin(x) dx and v = -cos(x):\n\n∫(1 - cos^2(x)) * sin(x) dx = -∫u dv = -[uv - ∫v du]\n\n= -(u*v - ∫v du) = -(1 - cos^2(x)) * (-cos(x)) - ∫(-cos(x) * 2cos(x)sin(x) dx)\n\n= cos(x) - cos^3(x) - 2∫cos^2(x)sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we can use the identity cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x) to rewrite the integral:\n\n= cos(x) - cos^3(x) - 2∫(1 - sin^2(x))sin(x) dx\n\nNow, let's integrate by parts again. Let u = sin(x) and dv = (1 - sin^2(x)) dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = -cos(x) + (1/3)cos^3(x):\n\n= cos(x) - cos^3(x) - 2[-∫u dv = -[uv - ∫v du]]\n\n= cos(x) - cos^3(x) - 2[-(sin(x) * (-cos(x) + (1/3)cos^3(x)) - ∫(-cos(x) + (1/3)cos^3(x))cos(x) dx)]\n\n= cos(x) - cos^3(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) - (2/3)sin(x)cos^3(x) - 2∫(-cos^2(x) + (1/3)cos^4(x)) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining terms:\n\n= cos(x) - cos^3(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) - (2/3)sin(x)cos^3(x) + 2∫cos^2(x) dx - (2/3)∫cos^4(x) dx\n\nThe remaining integrals, ∫cos^2(x) dx and ∫cos^4(x) dx, can be solved using the power-reduction formula or other techniques, but they will introduce additional terms and constants. To simplify the expression, we can leave the remaining integrals as they are:\n\n= cos(x) - cos^3(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) - (2/3)sin(x)cos^3(x) + 2∫cos^2(x) dx - (2/3)∫cos^4(x) dx + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration."
