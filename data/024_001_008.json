    "message_1": "A particle moves along the space curve given by the equation: \n\nr(t) = 2cos(t)i + 2sin(t)j + 3t^2k \n\nwhere i, j, and k are the unit vectors in the x, y, and z-directions, respectively, and t is time. Find the curvature and torsion of the curve at t = π/4.",
    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position vector r(t) with respect to time t.\n\nr'(t) = dr/dt = -2sin(t)i + 2cos(t)j + 6tk\n\nr''(t) = d²r/dt² = -2cos(t)i - 2sin(t)j + 6k\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vector T(t) and the normal vector N(t). The tangent vector is given by the unit tangent vector:\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\n\nr'(π/4) = -2sin(π/4)i + 2cos(π/4)j + 6(π/4)k = -√2i + √2j + (3π/2)k\n\n||r'(π/4)|| = √((-√2)² + (√2)² + (3π/2)²) = √(2 + 2 + 9π²/4) = √(4 + 9π²/4)\n\nT(π/4) = r'(π/4) / ||r'(π/4)|| = (-√2i + √2j + (3π/2)k) / √(4 + 9π²/4)\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to t:\n\ndT/dt = (-√2cos(t)i - √2sin(t)j + 3πk) / √(4 + 9π²/4)\n\nAt t = π/4:\n\ndT(π/4)/dt = (-√2cos(π/4)i - √2sin(π/4)j + 3πk) / √(4 + 9π²/4) = -i - j + 3πk / √(4 + 9π²/4)\n\nThe curvature, κ, is given by:\n\nκ = ||dT/dt|| = √((-1)² + (-1)² + (3π)² / (4 + 9π²/4)) = √(1 + 1 + 9π² / (4 + 9π²/4)) = 2 / √(4 + 9π²/4)\n\nNow, we find the binormal vector B(t) = T(t) x N(t):\n\nB(t) = T(t) x dT/dt\n\nAt t = π/4:\n\nB(π/4) = T(π/4) x dT(π/4)/dt = (-√2i + √2j + (3π/2)k) / √(4 + 9π²/4) x (-i - j + 3πk / √(4 + 9π²/4))\n\nB(π/4) = (6π - 6π)i + (-3π²/2 + 3π²/2)j + (2 - 2)k = 0\n\nSince B(π/4) = 0, the torsion τ is also 0.\n\nSo, the curvature κ at t = π/4 is:\n\nκ = 2 / √(4 + 9π²/4)\n\nAnd the torsion τ at t = π/4 is:\n\nτ = 0"
