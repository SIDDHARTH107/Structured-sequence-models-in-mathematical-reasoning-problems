    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed, we can use the concept of graph theory and the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have 7 vertices and 10 edges. First, we need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph, which is the maximum number of edges connected to a single vertex. Since we don't have the specific graph, we can use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nsum(degrees) = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nNow, let's assume that the maximum degree is d. Then, the sum of the degrees of the other 6 vertices is at most 6(d - 1), as each of them can have at most d - 1 edges. Therefore, we have:\n\nd + 6(d - 1) <= 20\nd + 6d - 6 <= 20\n7d <= 26\nd <= 26/7\n\nSince d must be an integer, the maximum degree d is at most 3. According to the Four Color Theorem, any planar graph can be colored with at most 4 colors. However, since our graph has a maximum degree of 3, we can use a greedy coloring algorithm to color the vertices with at most d + 1 = 4 colors.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 4."
