    "message_1": "A company sells two types of products A and B. Probability that a customer will buy product A is 0.6 and probability that a customer will buy product B is 0.4. If 50 customers visit the store, what is the probability that at least 30 of them will buy product A?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 30 customers will buy product A, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, customers buying product A)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6 for product A)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 50 customers)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 30 customers buying product A)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 30 customers buying product A, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 30 to k = 50:\n\nP(X >= 30) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 30 to 50\n\nWe can calculate this using the binomial probability formula for each value of k and summing the results:\n\nP(X >= 30) = P(X = 30) + P(X = 31) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them, we get:\n\nP(X >= 30) ≈ 0.9648\n\nSo, the probability that at least 30 customers will buy product A is approximately 0.9648 or 96.48%."
