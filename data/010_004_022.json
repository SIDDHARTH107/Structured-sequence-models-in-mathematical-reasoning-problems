    "message_2": "In a metric space, a subset is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Let's analyze each subset:\n\n(a) [0,1]: This subset is closed, as it contains all its limit points, and it is bounded, as it has a finite length. Therefore, [0,1] is compact.\n\n(b) (0,1]: This subset is not closed, as it does not contain the limit point 0. It is bounded, but since it is not closed, (0,1] is not compact.\n\n(c) [1,2]: This subset is closed, as it contains all its limit points, and it is bounded, as it has a finite length. Therefore, [1,2] is compact.\n\n(d) X = [0,2]: This subset is closed, as it contains all its limit points, and it is bounded, as it has a finite length. Therefore, X is compact."
