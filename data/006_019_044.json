    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected voter from this group would support party A, we need to divide the number of people who are willing to vote for party A by the total number of people surveyed.\n\nProbability = (Number of people willing to vote for party A) / (Total number of people surveyed)\n\nProbability = 320 / 500\n\nProbability = 0.64 or 64%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected voter from this group would support party A is 64%."
