Find the Tutte polynomial of G.\n\n```\n     a----b\n    /|    |\n   / |    |\n  c--d----e\n```\n\nNote: The Tutte polynomial of a graph is a polynomial that encodes information about various properties of the graph, including the number of spanning trees, the number of perfect matchings, and the chromatic polynomial.",
    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of G, we can use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G) = T(G\\e) + T(G/e)\n\nwhere G\\e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e. We will denote the Tutte polynomial as T(x, y).\n\nLet's start by labeling the edges of G:\n\n```\n     a----b\n    /|1   |2\n   / |    |\n  c--d----e\n   3  4    5\n```\n\nWe will compute the Tutte polynomial by recursively applying the formula to each edge:\n\n1. Edge 1 (a-d):\n\nG\\e1:\n```\n     a    b\n         |\n         |\n  c----d----e\n```\n\nG/e1:\n```\n     a----b\n    /     |\n   /      |\n  c----d----e\n```\n\n2.
