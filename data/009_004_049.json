    "message_1": "A spring-mass system has a mass of $\\text{0.5 kg}$ and a spring constant of $\\text{10 N/m}$. If the system is displaced $\\text{0.2 m}$ from its equilibrium position and released with zero initial velocity, what is the resulting displacement function with respect to time?",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement function with respect to time for a spring-mass system, we can use the equation for simple harmonic motion:\n\n$x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n\nwhere $x(t)$ is the displacement at time $t$, $A$ is the amplitude of the motion, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase angle.\n\nIn this case, the mass $m = 0.5 \\,\\text{kg}$ and the spring constant $k = 10 \\,\\text{N/m}$. The angular frequency $\\omega$ can be found using the formula:\n\n$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{0.5}} = \\sqrt{20}$\n\nSince the system is released from a displacement of $0.2 \\,\\text{m}$ with zero initial velocity, the amplitude $A$ is equal to the initial displacement, which is $0.2 \\,\\text{m}$. The phase angle $\\phi$ is $0$ because the system starts at its maximum displacement.\n\nNow we can write the displacement function with respect to time:\n\n$x(t) = 0.2 \\cos(\\sqrt{20} t)$"
