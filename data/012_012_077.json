    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the graph, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth ≤ 2 * (number of edges) / (number of vertices)\n\nIn this case, we have 10 vertices and 15 edges, so the inequality becomes:\n\ngirth ≤ 2 * 15 / 10\ngirth ≤ 3\n\nSince the girth must be an integer value and the smallest cycle in a graph has a length of 3 (a triangle), the girth of the graph is 3."
