Also, approximate the integral of f(x) from x=0 to x=1 using Simpson's 1/3 rule with equally spaced intervals.",
    "message_2": "First, let's approximate the first derivative of f(x) at x=2 using forward difference approximation with a step size of 0.1. \n\nThe forward difference approximation formula is:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere h is the step size (0.1 in this case).\n\nSo, we need to calculate f(2) and f(2.1):\n\nf(2) = 3(2)^4 + 2(2)^3 - 5(2)^2 + 8(2) - 10 = 48\nf(2.1) = 3(2.1)^4 + 2(2.1)^3 - 5(2.1)^2 + 8(2.1) - 10 ≈ 58.9263\n\nNow, we can approximate the first derivative:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (58.9263 - 48) / 0.1 ≈ 109.263\n\nNext, let's approximate the integral of f(x) from x=0 to x=1 using Simpson's 1/3 rule with equally spaced intervals. We will use n=2 intervals, so h=(1-0)/2=0.5.\n\nSimpson's 1/3 rule formula is:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ (h/3) * (f(x0) + 4f(x1) + f(x2))\n\nwhere x0 = 0, x1 = 0.5, and x2 = 1.\n\nWe need to calculate f(0), f(0.5), and f(1):\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^4 + 2(0)^3 - 5(0)^2 + 8(0) - 10 = -10\nf(0.5) = 3(0.5)^4 + 2(0.5)^3 - 5(0.5)^2 + 8(0.5) - 10 ≈ -6.3125\nf(1) = 3(1)^4 + 2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 8(1) - 10 = -2\n\nNow, we can approximate the integral:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ (0.5/3) * (-10 + 4(-6.3125) - 2) ≈ 1.458333\n\nSo, the approximate first derivative of f(x) at x=2 is 109.263, and the approximate integral of f(x) from x=0 to x=1 using Simpson's 1/3 rule is 1.458333."
