    "message_2": "a) To show that the point (-1,0) is on the curve X, we need to substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation of the curve and check if it satisfies the equation.\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1\n\nSubstitute x = -1 and y = 0:\n\n(0)^2 = (-1)^3 - 2(-1) + 1\n\n0 = -1 + 2 + 1\n\n0 = 0\n\nSince the equation is satisfied, the point (-1,0) is on the curve X.\n\nb) To find the equation of the tangent line L at the point (-1,0), we first need to find the derivative of the curve X with respect to x. Implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (3x^2 - 2) / (2y)\n\nAt the point (-1,0), the derivative is undefined because the denominator is 0. This means that the tangent line is vertical. Since the tangent line passes through the point (-1,0), the equation of the line L is:\n\nx = -1\n\nc) To find the other point of intersection of line L and curve X, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1\nx = -1\n\nSince x = -1, we can substitute this into the equation of the curve:\n\ny^2 = (-1)^3 - 2(-1) + 1\n\ny^2 = -1 + 2 + 1\n\ny^2 = 2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\ny = ±√2\n\nWe already know that one point of intersection is (-1,0), so the other point of intersection is (-1, ±√2)."
