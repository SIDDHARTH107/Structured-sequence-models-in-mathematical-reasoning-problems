    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)(5x - 1) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x^2 + 3x\nv(x) = 5x - 1\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x)/dx = 4x + 3\nv'(x) = d(5x - 1)/dx = 5\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nd(uv)/dx = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf'(x) = (4x + 3)(5x - 1) + (2x^2 + 3x)(5)\n\nNow, we can expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (20x^2 - 4x + 15x - 3) + (10x^3 + 15x^2)\n\nf'(x) = 10x^3 + 35x^2 + 11x - 3\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)(5x - 1) using the product rule is:\n\nf'(x) = 10x^3 + 35x^2 + 11x - 3"
