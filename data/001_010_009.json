    "message_2": "First, we will substitute the value of x into the expression:\n\n3(2(4) + 5) - 4(3(4) - 2)\n\nNow, we will perform the operations inside the parentheses:\n\n3(8 + 5) - 4(12 - 2)\n\nNext, we will perform the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\n3(13) - 4(10)\n\nNow, we will perform the multiplication:\n\n39 - 40\n\nFinally, we will perform the subtraction:\n\n39 - 40 = -1\n\nSo, the expression evaluates to -1 when x = 4."
