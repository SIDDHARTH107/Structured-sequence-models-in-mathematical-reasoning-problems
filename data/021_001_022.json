    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix.\n3. Use back-substitution to solve for the variables.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| -2  3 -1 |  6 |\n|  1 -4  5 | -3 |\n|  3 -2  1 | 13 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix.\n\nFirst, we will swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get a non-zero pivot element in the first row:\n\n|  1 -4  5 | -3 |\n| -2  3 -1 |  6 |\n|  3 -2  1 | 13 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the elements below the pivot element in the first column. Add 2 times Row 1 to Row 2, and subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 3:\n\n|  1 -4  5 | -3  |\n|  0 -5 -9 |  0  |\n|  0 10 -14| 22  |\n\nNow, we will divide Row 2 by -5 to get a non-zero pivot element in the second row:\n\n|  1 -4  5 | -3 |\n|  0  1  1.8 |  0 |\n|  0 10 -14 | 22 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the elements below the pivot element in the second column. Subtract 10 times Row 2 from Row 3:\n\n|  1  -4   5  | -3 |\n|  0   1   1.8|  0 |\n|  0   0  -4  | 22 |\n\nFinally, we will divide Row 3 by -4 to get a non-zero pivot element in the third row:\n\n|  1  -4   5  | -3 |\n|  0   1   1.8|  0 |\n|  0   0   1  | -5.5|\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix.\n\nStep 3: Use back-substitution to solve for the variables.\n\nFrom the last row, we have z = -5.5.\n\nNow, substitute z into the second row equation to find y:\n\ny + 1.8(-5.5) = 0\ny - 9.9 = 0\ny = 9.9\n\nFinally, substitute y and z into the first row equation to find x:\n\nx - 4(9.9) + 5(-5.5) = -3\nx - 39.6 - 27.5 = -3\nx - 67.1 = -3\nx = 64.1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 64.1, y = 9.9, and z = -5.5."
