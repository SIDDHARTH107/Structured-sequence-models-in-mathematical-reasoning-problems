    "message_2": "To evaluate the complex integral, we first need to find the antiderivative of the integrand function with respect to z. The integrand function is f(z) = 2z + 3i.\n\nLet's find the antiderivative F(z):\n\nF(z) = ∫(2z + 3i) dz\nF(z) = 2∫z dz + 3i∫dz\n\nNow, we integrate each term separately:\n\n∫z dz = (1/2)z^2 (using the power rule)\n∫dz = z (since the integral of 1 with respect to z is z)\n\nSo, F(z) = 2(1/2)z^2 + 3iz = z^2 + 3iz\n\nNow, we evaluate F(z) at the limits z1 and z2:\n\nF(z2) = (3 - 2i)^2 + 3i(3 - 2i)\nF(z1) = (1 + i)^2 + 3i(1 + i)\n\nLet's calculate F(z2) and F(z1):\n\nF(z2) = (9 - 12i + 4) + (9i - 6)\nF(z2) = 13 - 12i + 9i\nF(z2) = 13 - 3i\n\nF(z1) = (1 + 2i + 1) + (3i + 3)\nF(z1) = 2 + 2i + 3i + 3\nF(z1) = 5 + 5i\n\nNow, we find the difference F(z2) - F(z1):\n\nF(z2) - F(z1) = (13 - 3i) - (5 + 5i)\nF(z2) - F(z1) = 13 - 5 - 3i - 5i\nF(z2) - F(z1) = 8 - 8i\n\nSo, the value of the complex integral is:\n\n∫(2z + 3i) dz = 8 - 8i"
