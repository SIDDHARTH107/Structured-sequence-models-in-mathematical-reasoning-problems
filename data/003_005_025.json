    "message_2": "To find the value of x in radians using inverse trigonometric functions, we can use the arccosine (also written as cos^(-1) or acos) function. \n\nx = arccos(0.5)\n\nThe arccosine of 0.5 is π/3 or 60° in radians. However, the cosine function is periodic with a period of 2π, so there are multiple solutions for x. The general solution for x can be written as:\n\nx = π/3 + 2πn or x = 5π/3 + 2πn\n\nwhere n is an integer."
