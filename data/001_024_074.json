    "message_2": "To rewrite the given expression in terms of sine and cosine, we first need to recall the definitions of tangent and cotangent:\n\ntan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)\ncot(x) = cos(x) / sin(x)\n\nNow, we can substitute these definitions into the given expression:\n\ntan(x) + cot(x) = (sin(x) / cos(x)) + (cos(x) / sin(x))\n\nTo simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator, which is the product of the two denominators: cos(x) * sin(x). Then, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n[(sin(x) * sin(x)) + (cos(x) * cos(x))] / (cos(x) * sin(x))\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:\n\n1 / (cos(x) * sin(x))\n\nSo, the simplified expression in terms of sine and cosine is:\n\n1 / (cos(x) * sin(x))"
