    "message_2": "Let's rewrite the equation as follows:\n\nx^4 - 4x^2y^2 + y^4 + 4z^4 - 4x^2z^2 - 4y^2z^2 = 0\n\nNow, notice that we can group the terms as follows:\n\n(x^4 - 4x^2y^2 + y^4) + 4z^4 - 4x^2z^2 - 4y^2z^2 = 0\n\nThe first group of terms can be factored as a difference of squares:\n\n(x^2 - y^2)^2 + 4z^4 - 4x^2z^2 - 4y^2z^2 = 0\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation as:\n\n(x^2 - y^2)^2 = 4x^2z^2 + 4y^2z^2 - 4z^4\n\nSince the left side of the equation is a square, the right side must also be a square. Let's set:\n\nw^2 = 4x^2z^2 + 4y^2z^2 - 4z^4\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(x^2 - y^2)^2 = w^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nx^2 - y^2 = w\n\nNow, let's solve for x^2:\n\nx^2 = w + y^2\n\nSince x, y, and z are non-negative integers, w must also be a non-negative integer. \n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for x, y, and z.\n\nCase 1: z = 0\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n\nx^4 - 4x^2y^2 + y^4 = 0\n\nThis equation is only satisfied when x = y, so the solutions are (x, x, 0) for any non-negative integer x.\n\nCase 2: z > 0\nIn this case, we have:\n\nw^2 = 4x^2z^2 + 4y^2z^2 - 4z^4\n\nNotice that the right side of the equation is divisible by 4. Therefore, w^2 must also be divisible by 4, which implies that w must be divisible by 2. Let w = 2k, where k is a non-negative integer. Then:\n\n(2k)^2 = 4x^2z^2 + 4y^2z^2 - 4z^4\n\n4k^2 = 4x^2z^2 + 4y^2z^2 - 4z^4\n\nk^2 = x^2z^2 + y^2z^2 - z^4\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation as:\n\nk^2 + z^4 = x^2z^2 + y^2z^2\n\nSince x^2z^2 and y^2z^2 are both non-negative, we must have k^2 ≤ z^4. However, we also have k^2 ≥ z^4, since k^2 + z^4 ≥ 2z^4. Therefore, we must have k^2 = z^4, which implies k = z^2.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nx^2 = 2z^2 + y^2\n\nSince x^2 and y^2 are both non-negative, we must have x^2 ≥ y^2, which implies 2z^2 ≥ 0. Therefore, the only possible solution in this case is (z^2, 0, z) for any non-negative integer z.\n\nIn conclusion, the solutions to the equation are (x, x, 0) and (z^2, 0, z) for any non-negative integers x and z."
