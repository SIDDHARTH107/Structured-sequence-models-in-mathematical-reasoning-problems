    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).\n\nIn this case, the length is 12 meters and the width is 7 meters. So, we plug in the values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(12 + 7)\nPerimeter = 2(19)\nPerimeter = 38 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 38 meters."
