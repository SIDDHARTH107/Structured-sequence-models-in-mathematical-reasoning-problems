    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the operation of composition.\n\nIn the given graph, we have 6 vertices, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. Let's find the automorphisms of the graph.\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself, is always an automorphism. So, we have the identity automorphism (A, B, C, D, E, F).\n\n2. We can swap vertices B and C, and also swap vertices E and F. This gives us the automorphism (A, C, B, D, F, E).\n\n3. Similarly, we can swap vertices A and D, and also swap vertices B and E. This gives us the automorphism (D, E, C, A, B, F).\n\n4. Finally, we can apply both of the previous swaps, resulting in the automorphism (D, F, B, A, C, E).\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of the given graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of the graph is:\n\n{ (A, B, C, D, E, F), (A, C, B, D, F, E), (D, E, C, A, B, F), (D, F, B, A, C, E) }"
