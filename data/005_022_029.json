You have collected data on the salaries of 8 professors in the Economics department: $50,000, $45,000, $65,000, $57,000, $48,000, $150,000, $55,000,$ and $46,000$. Your colleague warns you that outliers in statistical data can have a large effect on the mean and standard deviation. Using Robust Statistics, calculate the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the salaries of the professors in the Economics department.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the salaries, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n$45,000, 46,000, 48,000, 50,000, 55,000, 57,000, 65,000, 150,000$\n\nNow, let's find the median (the middle value):\n\nSince there are 8 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (4th and 5th values):\n\nMedian = (50,000 + 55,000) / 2 = $52,500\n\nNext, we need to find the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (not including the overall median if the number of data points is odd):\n\nQ1 = (46,000 + 48,000) / 2 = $47,000\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (not including the overall median if the number of data points is odd):\n\nQ3 = (57,000 + 65,000) / 2 = $61,000\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 61,000 - 47,000 = $14,000\n\nSo, the median salary of the professors in the Economics department is $52,500, and the interquartile range (IQR) is $14,000."
