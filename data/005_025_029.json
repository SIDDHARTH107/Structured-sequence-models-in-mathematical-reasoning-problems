The company takes a random sample of 50 bulbs and finds that their average lifespan is 1,200 hours with a standard deviation of 150 hours. Find a 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of the bulbs.",
    "message_2": "To find a 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of the bulbs, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, σ is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nGiven:\nx̄ = 1,200 hours (sample mean)\nσ = 150 hours (sample standard deviation)\nn = 50 bulbs (sample size)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 1,200 ± (1.96 * (150 / √50))\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard Error = 150 / √50 ≈ 21.21\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error (Z * Standard Error):\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 21.21 ≈ 41.57\n\nFinally, find the confidence interval:\n\nLower Limit = 1,200 - 41.57 ≈ 1,158.43 hours\nUpper Limit = 1,200 + 41.57 ≈ 1,241.57 hours\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of the bulbs is approximately (1,158.43 hours, 1,241.57 hours)."
