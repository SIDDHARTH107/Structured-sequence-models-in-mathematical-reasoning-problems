    "message_1": "There are 4 different types of fruits: apples, bananas, cherries, and dates. How many ways are there to distribute these fruits among 3 people if each person must receive at least one fruit? (The answer is a Bell number.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Let's denote the number of ways to distribute the fruits among the 3 people as A(4,3).\n\nFirst, we find the total number of ways to distribute the fruits without any restrictions. There are 3 choices for each fruit, so there are 3^4 = 81 ways in total.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of ways where at least one person doesn't receive any fruit. There are 3 ways to choose which person doesn't receive a fruit, and then 2 choices for each fruit, so there are 3 * 2^4 = 48 ways.\n\nNow, we need to add back the number of ways where two people don't receive any fruit, as we've subtracted these cases twice. There are 3 ways to choose which person receives all the fruits, and then 1 choice for each fruit, so there are 3 * 1^4 = 3 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to distribute the fruits among the 3 people with each person receiving at least one fruit is:\n\nA(4,3) = 81 - 48 + 3 = 36 ways."
