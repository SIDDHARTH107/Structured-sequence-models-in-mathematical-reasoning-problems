    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem the student can solve:\n\nA factory produces three types of products - A, B, and C. The factory can produce a maximum of 500 units per day. Type A requires 2 hours of machine time, type B requires 1 hour, and type C requires 3 hours. The factory has 1200 machine hours available per day. The profit per unit for type A is $10, for type B it is $15, and for type C it is $20. The factory wants to maximize its profits. Formulate a stochastic optimization model to determine how many units of each type of product the factory should produce each day. Use Monte Carlo simulation to obtain an estimate of the expected profit per day for the factory.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first set up the optimization model, and then use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected profit per day.\n\nLet x_A, x_B, and x_C represent the number of units of product A, B, and C produced per day, respectively. Our objective is to maximize the profit function:\n\nP = 10x_A + 15x_B + 20x_C\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Total units produced per day: x_A + x_B + x_C ≤ 500\n2. Total machine hours: 2x_A + x_B + 3x_C ≤ 1200\n3. Non-negativity: x_A, x_B, x_C ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected profit per day. We will generate random values for x_A, x_B, and x_C, ensuring that they satisfy the constraints, and then calculate the profit for each set of values. After a large number of iterations, we will calculate the average profit to estimate the expected profit per day.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef random_solution():\n    while True:\n        x_A = np.random.randint(0, 501)\n        x_B = np.random.randint(0, 501 - x_A)\n        x_C = 500 - x_A - x_B\n        if 2 * x_A + x_B + 3 * x_C <= 1200:\n            return x_A, x_B, x_C\n\ndef profit(x_A, x_B, x_C):\n    return 10 * x_A + 15 * x_B + 20 * x_C\n\nnum_iterations = 100000\ntotal_profit = 0\n\nfor _ in range(num_iterations):\n    x_A, x_B, x_C = random_solution()\n    total_profit += profit(x_A, x_B, x_C)\n\nexpected_profit = total_profit / num_iterations\nprint(\"Expected profit per day:\", expected_profit)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you an estimate of the expected profit per day for the factory. Note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the simulation due to the random nature of the Monte Carlo method."
