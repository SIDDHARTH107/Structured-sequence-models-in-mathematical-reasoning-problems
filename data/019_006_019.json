    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to provide a precise numerical problem related to deontic logic as it is a branch of logic that deals with notions of obligation, permission, and related concepts, but not with numerical values or operations. Can I assist you with any other topic in mathematics?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Please provide a mathematical problem or topic you'd like assistance with, and I'll be happy to help."
