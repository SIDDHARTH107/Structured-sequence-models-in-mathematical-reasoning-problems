    "message_2": "To partition the number 10 into three positive integer parts, we can use the following method:\n\nLet the three parts be a, b, and c, where a ≥ b ≥ c > 0. We can find all possible combinations of a, b, and c that satisfy this condition and add up to 10.\n\n1. a = 8, b = 1, c = 1\n2. a = 7, b = 2, c = 1\n3. a = 6, b = 3, c = 1\n4. a = 6, b = 2, c = 2\n5. a = 5, b = 4, c = 1\n6. a = 5, b = 3, c = 2\n7. a = 4, b = 3, c = 3\n\nThere are 7 ways to partition the number 10 into three positive integer parts."
