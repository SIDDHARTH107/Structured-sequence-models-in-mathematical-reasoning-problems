    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\n2*(x + 2y - 3z) = 2*0\n2x + 4y - 6z = 0\n\n(2x - 3y + 2z) - (2x + 4y - 6z) = 0 - 0\n-7y + 8z = 0 (1)\n\n3*(x + 2y - 3z) = 3*0\n3x + 6y - 9z = 0\n\n(3x - y + 4z) - (3x + 6y - 9z) = 0 - 0\n-7y + 13z = 0 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, y and z:\n\n-7y + 8z = 0 (1)\n-7y + 13z = 0 (2)\n\nWe can eliminate y by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(13z - 8z) = 0\n5z = 0\n\nNow we can solve for z:\n\nz = 0\n\nNow substitute the value of z back into equation (1) to find the value of y:\n\n-7y + 8(0) = 0\n-7y = 0\n\ny = 0\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\nx + 2(0) - 3(0) = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
