    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate y from the first two equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 1, so that when we add the two equations, the y terms will cancel out.\n\n1*(x + y + 2z) = 1*(10)\n1*(2x - y + z) = 1*(3)\n\nThis gives us:\n\nx + y + 2z = 10\n2x - y + z = 3\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(x + y + 2z) + (2x - y + z) = 10 + 3\n3x + 3z = 13\n\nNow, we will eliminate y from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by 1, so that when we subtract the two equations, the y terms will cancel out.\n\n3*(2x - y + z) = 3*(3)\n1*(x - 3y + 4z) = 1*(9)\n\nThis gives us:\n\n6x - 3y + 3z = 9\nx - 3y + 4z = 9\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(6x - 3y + 3z) - (x - 3y + 4z) = 9 - 9\n5x - z = 0\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\n3x + 3z = 13\n5x - z = 0\n\nWe can solve for z in the second equation:\n\nz = 5x\n\nNow substitute this expression for z back into the first equation:\n\n3x + 3(5x) = 13\n3x + 15x = 13\n18x = 13\n\nNow solve for x:\n\nx = 13/18\n\nNow substitute the value of x back into the expression for z:\n\nz = 5(13/18)\nz = 65/18\n\nNow we will substitute the values of x and z back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. We will use the first equation:\n\n(13/18) + y + 2(65/18) = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 18 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n13 + 18y + 130 = 180\n18y = 37\ny = 37/18\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 13/18\ny = 37/18\nz = 65/18"
