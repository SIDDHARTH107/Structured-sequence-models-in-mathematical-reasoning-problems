    "message_1": "Suppose a town has three weather conditions: sunny, cloudy, and rainy. The probability of today being sunny given that yesterday was cloudy is 0.4, the probability of today being cloudy given that yesterday was sunny is 0.3, the probability of today being rainy given that yesterday was cloudy is 0.2, and the probability of today being sunny given that yesterday was rainy is 0.1. If today is sunny, what is the probability that yesterday was rainy?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that yesterday was rainy given that today is sunny, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, we want to find P(Yesterday was Rainy | Today is Sunny). We are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(Today is Sunny | Yesterday was Cloudy) = 0.4\nP(Today is Cloudy | Yesterday was Sunny) = 0.3\nP(Today is Rainy | Yesterday was Cloudy) = 0.2\nP(Today is Sunny | Yesterday was Rainy) = 0.1\n\nWe can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:\n\nP(Yesterday was Rainy | Today is Sunny) = P(Today is Sunny | Yesterday was Rainy) * P(Yesterday was Rainy) / P(Today is Sunny)\n\nWe don't have the probabilities P(Yesterday was Rainy) and P(Today is Sunny) directly, but we can find them using the law of total probability. Let's assume that the probabilities of each weather condition occurring are equal, i.e., P(Sunny) = P(Cloudy) = P(Rainy) = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can find P(Today is Sunny) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(Today is Sunny) = P(Today is Sunny | Yesterday was Sunny) * P(Yesterday was Sunny) + P(Today is Sunny | Yesterday was Cloudy) * P(Yesterday was Cloudy) + P(Today is Sunny | Yesterday was Rainy) * P(Yesterday was Rainy)\n\nSince we don't have the probability of today being sunny given that yesterday was sunny, we can find it using the fact that the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes (sunny, cloudy, and rainy) should be equal to 1:\n\nP(Today is Sunny | Yesterday was Sunny) = 1 - P(Today is Cloudy | Yesterday was Sunny) - P(Today is Rainy | Yesterday was Sunny)\n\nP(Today is Sunny | Yesterday was Sunny) = 1 - 0.3 - (1 - 0.4 - 0.1) = 0.4\n\nNow we can find P(Today is Sunny):\n\nP(Today is Sunny) = 0.4 * (1/3) + 0.4 * (1/3) + 0.1 * (1/3) = 0.3\n\nFinally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that yesterday was rainy given that today is sunny:\n\nP(Yesterday was Rainy | Today is Sunny) = 0.1 * (1/3) / 0.3 = 1/9 â‰ˆ 0.1111\n\nSo, the probability that yesterday was rainy given that today is sunny is approximately 0.1111 or 11.11%."
