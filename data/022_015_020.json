    "message_2": "To apply the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find a function g(z) that is the reflection of f(z) across the real axis. Since f(z) is a rational function, we can find g(z) by replacing z with its complex conjugate, z*.\n\nLet g(z) = f(z*), then g(z) = (z*^3) / ((z*^2 + 1)(z* - 2)).\n\nNow, we want to find f(2 + 3i). Notice that 2 + 3i is not in the domain of f(z) because it makes the denominator zero. However, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle to find the value of f(2 + 3i) by finding the value of g(2 - 3i) and then taking its complex conjugate.\n\nFirst, let's find g(2 - 3i):\n\ng(2 - 3i) = ((2 - 3i)^3) / (((2 - 3i)^2 + 1)((2 - 3i) - 2))\n           = ((2 - 3i)^3) / ((2 - 3i)^2 - (2 - 3i))\n\nNow, we need to compute (2 - 3i)^2 and (2 - 3i)^3:\n\n(2 - 3i)^2 = (2 - 3i)(2 - 3i) = 4 - 12i + 9i^2 = 4 - 12i - 9 = -5 - 12i\n\n(2 - 3i)^3 = (2 - 3i)(-5 - 12i) = -10 + 30i - 36i^2 - 9i^3 = -10 + 30i + 36 - 27i = 26 + 3i\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into g(2 - 3i):\n\ng(2 - 3i) = (26 + 3i) / (-5 - 12i - 2 + 3i)\n           = (26 + 3i) / (-7 - 9i)\n\nTo divide complex numbers, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\ng(2 - 3i) = (26 + 3i)(-7 + 9i) / ((-7 - 9i)(-7 + 9i))\n           = (-182 + 189 + 21i + 27i^2) / (49 + 63i - 63i - 81i^2)\n           = (-182 + 189 - 27 + 21i) / (49 - 81)\n           = (7 + 21i) / (-32)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\ng(2 - 3i) = -7/32 - 21i/32\n\nFinally, we take the complex conjugate of g(2 - 3i) to find f(2 + 3i):\n\nf(2 + 3i) = (-7/32 + 21i/32)\n\nSo, f(2 + 3i) = -7/32 + 21i/32."
