    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of two sides are 7cm each while the length of the base is x cm. If the perimeter of the triangle is 21cm, what is the length of the base of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the base as x cm. Since the perimeter of the triangle is 21 cm, we can write the equation:\n\n7 cm + 7 cm + x cm = 21 cm\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n14 cm + x cm = 21 cm\n\nSubtract 14 cm from both sides of the equation:\n\nx cm = 7 cm\n\nSo, the length of the base of the triangle is 7 cm."
