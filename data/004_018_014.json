    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 7 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\n1. Differentiate 4x^3:\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2. So, the derivative of 4x^3 is 4(3x^2) = 12x^2.\n\n2. Differentiate -5x^2:\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x^2 is 2x. So, the derivative of -5x^2 is -5(2x) = -10x.\n\n3. Differentiate 3x:\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x is 1. So, the derivative of 3x is 3(1) = 3.\n\n4. Differentiate -7:\nThe derivative of a constant is 0. So, the derivative of -7 is 0.\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 10x + 3"
