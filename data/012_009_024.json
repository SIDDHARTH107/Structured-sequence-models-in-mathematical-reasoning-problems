    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in the graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nDegree sequence: {3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1}\n\nSum of degrees: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 17\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of degrees is equal to 2 * number of edges. Therefore:\n\n17 = 2 * number of edges\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nnumber of edges = 17 / 2\n\nSince the number of edges must be an integer, there is an issue with the given degree sequence, as it results in a non-integer number of edges. This means that the given degree sequence is not valid for a simple graph."
