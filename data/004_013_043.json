    "message_2": "To minimize the material used in the construction of the tank, we need to minimize the surface area of the tank while maintaining a volume of 50 cubic meters. Let's denote the length, width, and height of the tank as L, W, and H, respectively. The volume V and surface area S of the tank can be expressed as:\n\nV = L * W * H = 50 m³\nS = L * W + 2 * L * H + 2 * W * H\n\nWe can rewrite the volume equation to express one of the dimensions in terms of the other two:\n\nH = 50 / (L * W)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for H into the surface area equation:\n\nS = L * W + 2 * L * (50 / (L * W)) + 2 * W * (50 / (L * W))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nS = L * W + 100 / W + 100 / L\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can use calculus. We'll find the partial derivatives of S with respect to L and W, and set them equal to 0:\n\n∂S/∂L = W - 100 / L² = 0\n∂S/∂W = L - 100 / W² = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express W in terms of L:\n\nW = 100 / L²\n\nSubstitute this expression for W into the second equation:\n\nL - 100 / (100 / L²)² = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nL - L³ = 0\n\nFactor out L:\n\nL(L² - 1) = 0\n\nThe possible solutions for L are 0, 1, and -1. Since L must be positive, we have L = 1. Now, we can find W:\n\nW = 100 / L² = 100 / 1² = 100\n\nFinally, we can find H:\n\nH = 50 / (L * W) = 50 / (1 * 100) = 0.5\n\nSo, the dimensions of the tank that require the least material to be used in its construction are:\n\nLength (L) = 1 m\nWidth (W) = 100 m\nHeight (H) = 0.5 m"
