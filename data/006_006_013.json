    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the team scoring exactly 2 goals in a match, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of scoring exactly k goals\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of scoring a goal (0.6)\n- n is the total number of goals in the match\n- k is the number of goals we want the team to score (2)\n\nAssuming the team has 3 chances to score in the match (n = 3), we can calculate the probability of scoring exactly 2 goals:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(3, 2) * 0.6^2 * (1-0.6)^(3-2)\n\nFirst, calculate C(3, 2):\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3-2)!)\nC(3, 2) = 6 / (2 * 1)\nC(3, 2) = 3\n\nNow, plug the values into the formula:\nP(X = 2) = 3 * 0.6^2 * 0.4^1\nP(X = 2) = 3 * 0.36 * 0.4\nP(X = 2) = 0.432\n\nSo, the probability of the team scoring exactly 2 goals in a match with 3 chances is 0.432 or 43.2%."
