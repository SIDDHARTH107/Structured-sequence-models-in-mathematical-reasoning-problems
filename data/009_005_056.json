    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the voltage across the capacitor at t = 0.01 seconds. We can start by writing down the differential equation for the circuit, which is given by Kirchhoff's voltage law:\n\nV_R + V_L + V_C = 0\n\nwhere V_R is the voltage across the resistor, V_L is the voltage across the inductor, and V_C is the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nThe voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law:\n\nV_R = iR\n\nwhere i is the current through the circuit and R is the resistance.\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is given by:\n\nV_L = L(di/dt)\n\nwhere L is the inductance and di/dt is the time derivative of the current.\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is given by:\n\nV_C = Q/C\n\nwhere Q is the charge on the capacitor and C is the capacitance.\n\nNow we can write the differential equation for the circuit:\n\niR + L(di/dt) + Q/C = 0\n\nWe can differentiate the equation with respect to time to eliminate Q:\n\nR(di/dt) + L(d^2i/dt^2) + (1/C)(dQ/dt) = 0\n\nSince dQ/dt = i, the equation becomes:\n\nR(di/dt) + L(d^2i/dt^2) + (1/C)i = 0\n\nNow we have a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The equation can be written in the standard form:\n\n(d^2i/dt^2) + (R/L)(di/dt) + (1/LC)i = 0\n\nGiven the values of R, L, and C:\n\nR = 100 ohms\nL = 0.05 H\nC = 0.01 F\n\nWe can find the coefficients:\n\nR/L = 100/0.05 = 2000\n1/LC = 1/(0.05 * 0.01) = 2000\n\nThe differential equation becomes:\n\n(d^2i/dt^2) + 2000(di/dt) + 2000i = 0\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can assume a solution of the form:\n\ni(t) = e^(st)\n\nwhere s is a complex number.\n\nPlugging this into the differential equation, we get the characteristic equation:\n\ns^2 + 2000s + 2000 = 0\n\nSolving for s, we find two complex roots:\n\ns1 = -1000 + 1000j\ns2 = -1000 - 1000j\n\nThe general solution for the current is:\n\ni(t) = A*e^(-1000t) * cos(1000t) + B*e^(-1000t) * sin(1000t)\n\nwhere A and B are constants.\n\nAt t = 0, the capacitor is charged to 50 volts, and there is no current flowing through the circuit:\n\ni(0) = 0 = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0)\nA = 0\n\nSo the current is:\n\ni(t) = B*e^(-1000t) * sin(1000t)\n\nNow we can find the voltage across the capacitor:\n\nV_C(t) = Q(t)/C = (integral of i(t) dt)/C\n\nIntegrating i(t) with respect to time:\n\nQ(t) = integral(B*e^(-1000t) * sin(1000t) dt)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nu = e^(-1000t), dv = B*sin(1000t) dt\ndu = -1000*e^(-1000t) dt, v = -(1/1000)*B*cos(1000t)\n\nQ(t) = -B*e^(-1000t)*cos(1000t)/1000 + (1/1000)*integral(1000*e^(-1000t)*cos(1000t) dt)\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\nu = e^(-1000t), dv = 1000*B*cos(1000t) dt\ndu = -1000*e^(-1000t) dt, v = (1/1000)*B*sin(1000t)\n\nQ(t) = -B*e^(-1000t)*cos(1000t)/1000 + B*e^(-1000t)*sin(1000t)/1000^2 + C1\n\nNow we can find the voltage across the capacitor:\n\nV_C(t) = Q(t)/C = (-B*e^(-1000t)*cos(1000t) + B*e^(-1000t)*sin(1000t) + 1000*C1)/10\n\nAt t = 0, the voltage across the capacitor is 50 volts:\n\nV_C(0) = 50 = (-B*cos(0) + B*sin(0) + 1000*C1)/10\nC1 = 0.05\n\nSo the voltage across the capacitor is:\n\nV_C(t) = (-B*e^(-1000t)*cos(1000t) + B*e^(-1000t)*sin(1000t) + 50)/10\n\nAt t = 0.01 seconds, we can find the voltage across the capacitor:\n\nV_C(0.01) = (-B*e^(-10)*cos(10) + B*e^(-10)*sin(10) + 50)/10\n\nSince the initial current is 0, the term with B will be 0. Therefore, the voltage across the capacitor at t = 0.01 seconds is:\n\nV_C(0.01) = (50)/10 = 5 volts"
