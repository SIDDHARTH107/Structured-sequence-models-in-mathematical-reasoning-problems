Below are the monthly sales figures:\n\n| Month | Sales |\n|-------|-------|\n| Jan-18 | 200   |\n| Feb-18 | 300   |\n| Mar-18 | 250   |\n| Apr-18 | 350   |\n| May-18 | 400   |\n| Jun-18 | 450   |\n| Jul-18 | 500   |\n| Aug-18 | 550   |\n| Sep-18 | 600   |\n| Oct-18 | 700   |\n| Nov-18 | 800   |\n| Dec-18 | 900   |\n| Jan-19 | 250   |\n| Feb-19 | 350   |\n| Mar-19 | 300   |\n| Apr-19 | 400   |\n| May-19 | 450   |\n| Jun-19 | 500   |\n| Jul-19 | 600   |\n| Aug-19 | 700   |\n| Sep-19 | 800   |\n| Oct-19 | 900   |\n| Nov-19 | 1000  |\n| Dec-19 | 1100  |\n\nIf the company's management wants to predict the sales for December 2020, how many units of the product do they need to produce assuming the sales follow a linear trend?",
    "message_2": "To predict the sales for December 2020, we can use the linear trend method. First, we need to find the average monthly increase in sales over the given period.\n\nThere are 24 months of data, from January 2018 to December 2019. The total increase in sales over this period is:\n\n1100 (Dec-19) - 200 (Jan-18) = 900\n\nNow, we can find the average monthly increase:\n\n900 / 24 = 37.5\n\nSince the sales follow a linear trend, we can assume that the sales will continue to increase by 37.5 units per month. To predict the sales for December 2020, we need to find the number of months between December 2019 and December 2020:\n\n12 months (1 year)\n\nNow, we can calculate the predicted sales for December 2020:\n\n1100 (Dec-19 sales) + (12 months * 37.5 units/month) = 1100 + 450 = 1550\n\nThe company should produce 1550 units of the product for December 2020, assuming the sales follow a linear trend."
