    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\n4x + 6.1y = 14.2\n\nIf this system is represented as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the variable matrix (containing x and y), and b is the constant matrix (containing the values on the right-hand side of each equation), find the determinant of A. Is the matrix A ill-conditioned? Explain your answer.",
    "message_2": "First, let's represent the system of linear equations as a matrix equation Ax = b.\n\nThe coefficient matrix A is:\n```\nA = | 2  3  |\n    | 4  6.1|\n```\n\nThe variable matrix x is:\n```\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n```\n\nAnd the constant matrix b is:\n```\nb = |  7  |\n    | 14.2|\n```\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of A. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is calculated as follows:\n\ndet(A) = (a*d) - (b*c)\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4, and d = 6.1. So,\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 6.1) - (3 * 4) = 12.2 - 12 = 0.2\n\nThe determinant of A is 0.2.\n\nA matrix is considered ill-conditioned if its determinant is close to zero, which means that the matrix is nearly singular and can lead to large errors in the solution when using numerical methods. In this case, the determinant of A is 0.2, which is not very close to zero. Therefore, we can conclude that the matrix A is not ill-conditioned."
