    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will take the logarithm of both sides of the equation. We can use the natural logarithm (ln) for this purpose:\n\n$ln(3^x) = ln(45)$\n\nUsing the logarithmic property that states $ln(a^b) = b * ln(a)$, we can rewrite the left side of the equation as:\n\n$x * ln(3) = ln(45)$\n\nNow, to solve for x, we will divide both sides of the equation by $ln(3)$:\n\n$x = \\frac{ln(45)}{ln(3)}$\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\n$x \\approx 3.449$\n\nSo, $x \\approx 3.449$ is the solution to the equation $3^x = 45$."
