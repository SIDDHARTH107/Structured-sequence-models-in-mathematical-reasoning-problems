    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of the 5th term in the expansion of (2x + 3)^{10}, we can use the binomial theorem and Pascal's Triangle.\n\nThe binomial theorem states that for any positive integer n, and any real numbers a and b:\n\n(a + b)^n = C(n, 0) * a^n * b^0 + C(n, 1) * a^{n-1} * b^1 + ... + C(n, n) * a^0 * b^n\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using Pascal's Triangle or the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 10, a = 2x, and b = 3. We want to find the coefficient of the 5th term, which corresponds to k = 4 (since we start counting from the 0th term).\n\nUsing the formula for the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!) = 10! / (4!6!) = 210\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of a and b into the binomial theorem:\n\n(2x + 3)^{10} = ... + C(10, 4) * (2x)^{10-4} * 3^4 + ...\n\nThe coefficient of the 5th term is:\n\n210 * (2^6) * 3^4 = 210 * 64 * 81 = 1088640\n\nSo, the coefficient of the 5th term in the expansion of (2x + 3)^{10} is 1088640."
