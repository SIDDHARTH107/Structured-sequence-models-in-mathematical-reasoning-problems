    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we first need to find all the divisors of the order of G, which is 20. The divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, for each divisor d of the order of G, there exists a unique subgroup of G of order d. Therefore, there are subgroups of orders 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20 in G.\n\nNow, let's find the generators for each of these subgroups:\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: {e}, where e is the identity element.\n2. Subgroup of order 2: Since 20/2 = 10, the generator of this subgroup is a^10. So, the subgroup is {e, a^10}.\n3. Subgroup of order 4: Since 20/4 = 5, the generator of this subgroup is a^5. So, the subgroup is {e, a^5, a^10, a^15}.\n4. Subgroup of order 5: Since 20/5 = 4, the generator of this subgroup is a^4. So, the subgroup is {e, a^4, a^8, a^12, a^16}.\n5. Subgroup of order 10: Since 20/10 = 2, the generator of this subgroup is a^2. So, the subgroup is {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10, a^12, a^14, a^16, a^18}.\n6. Subgroup of order 20: The generator of this subgroup is a. So, the subgroup is {e, a, a^2, a^3, ..., a^18, a^19}.\n\nNow, we need to prove that each of these subgroups is cyclic. A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. We have already found the generators for each of the subgroups, so we can conclude that each subgroup is cyclic.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: This subgroup is generated by the identity element e.\n2. Subgroup of order 2: This subgroup is generated by the element a^10.\n3. Subgroup of order 4: This subgroup is generated by the element a^5.\n4. Subgroup of order 5: This subgroup is generated by the element a^4.\n5. Subgroup of order 10: This subgroup is generated by the element a^2.\n6. Subgroup of order 20: This subgroup is generated by the element a.\n\nThus, we have found all the subgroups of G and proved that each of them is cyclic."
