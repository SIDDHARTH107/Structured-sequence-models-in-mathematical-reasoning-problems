Whatever amount Player A sends will be tripled, and Player B will then decide how much money to send back to Player A (any amount between $0 and $30). Suppose Player A sends $4 to Player B. What is the maximum amount Player B can send back to Player A while still benefiting themselves the most?",
    "message_2": "In this Trust Game, Player A sends $4 to Player B. The amount sent by Player A is tripled, so Player B receives 3 * $4 = $12.\n\nNow, Player B has to decide how much money to send back to Player A. To maximize their own benefit, Player B should send back an amount that still leaves them with more money than they started with.\n\nPlayer B started with $0 and now has $12. If Player B sends back $x to Player A, they will have $12 - $x left. To ensure that Player B still has more money than they started with, we need to find the maximum value of $x$ such that:\n\n$12 - x > 0$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x < 12$\n\nSo, the maximum amount Player B can send back to Player A while still benefiting themselves the most is $11. If Player B sends back $11, they will have $12 - $11 = $1 left, which is more than they started with."
