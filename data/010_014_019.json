    "message_2": "We will use the fact that for a closed orientable surface X of genus g, its first homology group H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to Z^{2g}. This can be shown using the classification theorem for compact surfaces, which states that any closed orientable surface is homeomorphic to a connected sum of g tori, where g is the genus of the surface.\n\nNow, let's consider the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology, which relates the cohomology groups of a space to its homology groups. The theorem states that for any topological space X and any abelian group G, there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H_{i-1}(X, Z), G) → H^i(X, G) → Hom(H_i(X, Z), G) → 0\n\nFor our case, we are interested in the first cohomology group H^1(X, Z), so we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H_0(X, Z), Z) → H^1(X, Z) → Hom(H_1(X, Z), Z) → 0\n\nSince X is connected, its zeroth homology group H_0(X, Z) is isomorphic to Z. The Ext functor applied to Z is trivial, so Ext(H_0(X, Z), Z) = 0. Therefore, the short exact sequence simplifies to:\n\n0 → H^1(X, Z) → Hom(H_1(X, Z), Z) → 0\n\nThis implies that H^1(X, Z) is isomorphic to Hom(H_1(X, Z), Z). Now, we know that H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to Z^{2g}. The Hom group Hom(Z^{2g}, Z) is isomorphic to the direct product of 2g copies of Z, which can be written as Z^{2g}.\n\nThus, we have shown that the first cohomology group of X with integer coefficients H^1(X, Z) is isomorphic to Z^{2g}."
