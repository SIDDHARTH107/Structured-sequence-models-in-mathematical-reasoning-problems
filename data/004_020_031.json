    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector, and then integrate it over the path.\n\nFirst, let's find the displacement vector. The initial position is (1,1) and the final position is (4,5). So, the displacement vector is:\n\nΔx = 4 - 1 = 3\nΔy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nDisplacement vector = (3, 4)\n\nNow, let's find the force vector. The problem states that a 10 Newton force is applied, but it doesn't specify the direction. To find the direction, we can assume that the force is applied in the same direction as the displacement vector. So, we can find the unit vector in the direction of the displacement vector and then multiply it by the magnitude of the force (10 N).\n\nUnit vector = (3/5, 4/5) (since √(3^2 + 4^2) = 5)\n\nForce vector = 10 * (3/5, 4/5) = (6, 8)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector:\n\nDot product = (6 * 3) + (8 * 4) = 18 + 32 = 50\n\nSince the force is constant, we don't need to integrate it over the path. The work done by the force is equal to the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector:\n\nWork = 50 Joules"
