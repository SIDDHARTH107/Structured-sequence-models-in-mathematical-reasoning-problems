    "message_2": "(a) We can find the values of x_n for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 by iterating the logistic map equation with the initial condition x_0 = 0.25:\n\nx_1 = 4 * 0.25 * (1 - 0.25) = 0.75\nx_2 = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\nx_3 = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\nx_4 = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\nx_5 = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n\n(b) To iterate the function up to n = 20 and plot the sequence of x_n values, you can use a calculator or software like Python or MATLAB. Here's an example using Python:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef logistic_map(x):\n    return 4 * x * (1 - x)\n\nx_values = [0.25]\nfor i in range(20):\n    x_values.append(logistic_map(x_values[-1]))\n\nplt.plot(range(21), x_values, marker='o')\nplt.xlabel('n')\nplt.ylabel('x_n')\nplt.title('Logistic Map Iteration')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will generate a plot of the x_n values up to n = 20.\n\n(c) The value of r at which the sequence of x_n values becomes chaotic using the period-doubling route to chaos is approximately r = 3.57. This value is known as the Feigenbaum constant, and it is the point at which the logistic map undergoes a transition from periodic behavior to chaotic behavior."
