    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. Each unit of product A is sold for $10 while each unit of product B is sold for $20. The cost of producing one unit of A is $8 whereas the cost of producing one unit of B is $10. The company can produce at most 300 units per day, and has an inventory limit of 100 units for each product. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit for product A is $10 - $8 = $2 per unit, and the profit for product B is $20 - $10 = $10 per unit.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 2x + 10y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1. x + y ≤ 300 (The company can produce at most 300 units per day)\n2. x ≤ 100 (Inventory limit for product A)\n3. y ≤ 100 (Inventory limit for product B)\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (100, 0), (100, 100), and (200, 100).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 2(0) + 10(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (100, 0) = 2(100) + 10(0) = $200\n3. Profit at (100, 100) = 2(100) + 10(100) = $1200\n4. Profit at (200, 100) = 2(200) + 10(100) = $2200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (200, 100), where the company produces 200 units of product A and 100 units of product B. The maximum profit is $2200."
