    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a connected graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges, we first need to understand the Tutte polynomial. The Tutte polynomial, T(x, y), is a two-variable polynomial that encodes information about the graph's structure, such as the number of spanning trees, the number of connected components, and the chromatic polynomial.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial is defined recursively as follows:\n\n1. If G is the empty graph, then T(G; x, y) = 1.\n2. If G has an isolated vertex v, then T(G; x, y) = x * T(G - v; x, y), where G - v is the graph obtained by removing vertex v.\n3. If G has a loop at vertex v, then T(G; x, y) = y * T(G - e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by removing the loop edge e.\n4. If G has a non-loop edge e connecting vertices u and v, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y), where G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nHowever, calculating the Tutte polynomial directly using these recursive rules can be computationally expensive. Instead, we can use the following formula for connected graphs:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)^(n - k) * (y - 1)^(m - n + k)\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices, m is the number of edges, and k is the number of connected components.\n\nIn our case, the graph is connected, so k = 1. We have n = 7 vertices and m = 9 edges. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)^(7 - 1) * (y - 1)^(9 - 7 + 1)\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)^6 * (y - 1)^3\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the connected graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges is:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)^6 * (y - 1)^3"
