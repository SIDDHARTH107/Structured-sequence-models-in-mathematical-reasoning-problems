    "message_2": "To find a cyclic generator for every subgroup H of G, we first need to find all possible orders of subgroups of G. The order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group, so we need to find the divisors of 20. The divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.\n\nNow, we will find a cyclic generator for each subgroup of order n, where n is a divisor of 20:\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: This is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element. The cyclic generator is e.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2: The elements of order 2 divide 20 by 2, so we have g^10. The subgroup H = {e, g^10} is generated by g^10.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 4: The elements of order 4 divide 20 by 4, so we have g^5. The subgroup H = {e, g^5, g^10, g^15} is generated by g^5.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 5: The elements of order 5 divide 20 by 5, so we have g^4. The subgroup H = {e, g^4, g^8, g^12, g^16} is generated by g^4.\n\n5. Subgroup of order 10: The elements of order 10 divide 20 by 2, so we have g^2. The subgroup H = {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10, g^12, g^14, g^16, g^18} is generated by g^2.\n\n6. Subgroup of order 20: This is the entire group G, generated by g.\n\nIn summary, the cyclic generators for each subgroup H of G are:\n\n- Order 1: e\n- Order 2: g^10\n- Order 4: g^5\n- Order 5: g^4\n- Order 10: g^2\n- Order 20: g"
