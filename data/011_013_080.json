    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem, we first need to find the number of ways to divide the group of 10 friends into two teams of 5 each without any restrictions. Then, we will subtract the number of ways where Alice and Bob are on the same team.\n\nWithout any restrictions, we can divide the group of 10 friends into two teams of 5 each in C(10,5) ways, where C(n,k) denotes the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. \n\nC(10,5) = 10! / (5! * 5!) = 252 ways\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways where Alice and Bob are on the same team. We can consider two cases:\n\n1. Alice and Bob are on Team 1: In this case, we need to choose 3 more friends from the remaining 8 to complete Team 1. This can be done in C(8,3) ways.\n\nC(8,3) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = 56 ways\n\n2. Alice and Bob are on Team 2: Similarly, we need to choose 3 more friends from the remaining 8 to complete Team 2. This can also be done in C(8,3) ways.\n\nC(8,3) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = 56 ways\n\nSo, the total number of ways where Alice and Bob are on the same team is 56 + 56 = 112 ways.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of ways where Alice and Bob are on the same team from the total number of ways without any restrictions:\n\n252 - 112 = 140 ways\n\nTherefore, there are 140 ways to divide the group of 10 friends into two teams of 5 each if Alice and Bob refuse to be on the same team."
