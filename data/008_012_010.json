    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7  |\n    | -1 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the inverse of A using the formula A^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjoint(A), where adjoint(A) is the matrix obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdjoint(A) = | -5 -3 |\n             | -4  2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                  | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/22  3/22 |\n          | 4/22 -2/22 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/22  3/22 | * | 7  |\n    |  4/22 -2/22 |   | -1 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nX = | (5/22)*7 + (3/22)*(-1) |\n    | (4/22)*7 + (-2/22)*(-1) |\n\nX = | 31/22 |\n    | 30/22 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 31/22\ny = 30/22\n\nAs an ordered pair, the solution is (31/22, 30/22)."
