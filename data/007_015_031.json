    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 200, we can start by finding the smallest integer n such that 2^n - 1 > 200.\n\n2^7 = 128, so 2^7 - 1 = 127, which is less than 200.\n2^8 = 256, so 2^8 - 1 = 255, which is greater than 200.\n\nNow, we need to check if 2^8 - 1 = 255 is a prime number. 255 is divisible by 3 (3 * 85 = 255), so it is not a prime number.\n\nThe next Mersenne number is 2^9 - 1 = 512 - 1 = 511. 511 is divisible by 7 (7 * 73 = 511), so it is not a prime number either.\n\nThe next Mersenne number is 2^10 - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023. 1023 is divisible by 3 (3 * 341 = 1023), so it is not a prime number either.\n\nThe next Mersenne number is 2^11 - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047. 2047 is divisible by 23 (23 * 89 = 2047), so it is not a prime number either.\n\nThe next Mersenne number is 2^12 - 1 = 4096 - 1 = 4095. 4095 is divisible by 3 (3 * 1365 = 4095), so it is not a prime number either.\n\nThe next Mersenne number is 2^13 - 1 = 8192 - 1 = 8191. 8191 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 200 is 8191."
