    "message_2": "To find the geodesic between the points (-1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 1) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we need to find the Lagrangian for the problem. The arc length of a curve on the surface can be expressed as:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 + (∂z/∂y)^2) ds\n\nwhere ds is an infinitesimal arc length along the curve. Since z = x^2 + y^2, we have:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, let's parameterize the curve by a parameter t, such that x = x(t) and y = y(t). Then, the arc length can be written as:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2) dt\n\nwhere x' = dx/dt and y' = dy/dt. The Lagrangian L is the integrand of the arc length:\n\nL = √(1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)\n\nNow we can apply the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the geodesic:\n\nd/dt (∂L/∂x') - ∂L/∂x = 0\nd/dt (∂L/∂y') - ∂L/∂y = 0\n\nComputing the derivatives, we get:\n\n∂L/∂x' = (4x' * (1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)^(-1/2))\n∂L/∂y' = (4y' * (1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)^(-1/2))\n\nSince L does not depend on x and y explicitly, the Euler-Lagrange equations simplify to:\n\nd/dt (4x' * (1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)^(-1/2)) = 0\nd/dt (4y' * (1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)^(-1/2)) = 0\n\nThese equations imply that the quantities in the parentheses are constant:\n\n4x' * (1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)^(-1/2) = C1\n4y' * (1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)^(-1/2) = C2\n\nSolving these equations for x' and y', we get:\n\nx' = C1 * (1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)^(1/2) / 4\ny' = C2 * (1 + (2x')^2 + (2y')^2)^(1/2) / 4\n\nNow, we can integrate these equations to find x(t) and y(t), and then find the geodesic curve on the surface z = x^2 + y^2. However, this is a complicated task and usually requires numerical methods.\n\nIn this particular case, we can notice that the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is rotationally symmetric around the z-axis, and the points (-1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 1) are symmetric with respect to the z-axis. Therefore, the geodesic between these points must lie in the plane y = 0. In this plane, the surface becomes z = x^2, and the geodesic is simply a straight line connecting the points (-1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 1). The equation of this line is:\n\nx(t) = -1 + 2t\ny(t) = 0\nz(t) = (-1 + 2t)^2\n\nfor t ∈ [0, 1]."
