    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 4² + 5²) = √(9 + 16 + 25) = √50\n|B| = √(2² + 1² + 7²) = √(4 + 1 + 49) = √54\n\nNext, let's find the angle θ between the two vectors using the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A||B|cos(θ)\n\n3*2 + 4*1 + 5*7 = 50cos(θ)\n22 + 4 + 35 = 50cos(θ)\n61 = 50cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 61/50\nθ = arccos(61/50)\n\nNow, we can find the cross product using the formula:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\n|A||B|sin(θ) = √50 * √54 * sin(arccos(61/50))\n\nTo find the unit vector n, we can use the determinant method:\n\nn = <(4*7 - 5*1), -(3*7 - 5*2), (3*1 - 4*2)>\nn = <28 - 5, -(21 - 10), 3 - 8>\nn = <23, -11, -5>\n\nNow, we can find the cross product:\n\nA x B = (√50 * √54 * sin(arccos(61/50))) * <23, -11, -5>\n\nTo find the components of the resulting vector, we can calculate each component separately:\n\nx-component: (√50 * √54 * sin(arccos(61/50))) * 23 ≈ 23.00\ny-component: (√50 * √54 * sin(arccos(61/50))) * -11 ≈ -11.00\nz-component: (√50 * √54 * sin(arccos(61/50))) * -5 ≈ -5.00\n\nSo, the cross product of A and B is approximately:\n\nA x B ≈ <23.00, -11.00, -5.00>"
