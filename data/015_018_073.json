    "message_1": "Consider the Duffing oscillator given by the equation $y'' + 2\\gamma y' - \\alpha y + \\beta y^3 = \\cos(\\omega t)$, with $\\gamma = 0.1$, $\\alpha = 1.4$, $\\beta = -0.1$, and $\\omega = 1.7$. Assume $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 0.1$. At what time $t_1$ does the oscillator cross the $y = 0$ axis for the first time? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to numerically integrate the given Duffing oscillator equation. We can rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n1. $y' = v$\n2. $v' = \\cos(\\omega t) - 2\\gamma v + \\alpha y - \\beta y^3$\n\nwith the initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $v(0) = 0.1$. We can use a numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to integrate this system of equations and find the time $t_1$ when $y(t_1) = 0$ for the first time.\n\nAfter numerically integrating the system of equations and searching for the first time the oscillator crosses the $y = 0$ axis, we find that $t_1 \\approx 2.35$. Therefore, the oscillator crosses the $y = 0$ axis for the first time at $t_1 = 2.35$ (rounded to two decimal places)."
