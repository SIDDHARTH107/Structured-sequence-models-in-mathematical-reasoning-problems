    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a car accident occurring on a certain road, we need to first find the total number of cars that traveled on that road in the past year.\n\nAssuming there are 365 days in a year, the total number of cars that traveled on the road in the past year is:\n\n2000 cars/day * 365 days = 730,000 cars\n\nNow, we know that there were 3 accidents reported in the past year. So, the probability of a car accident occurring on that road is:\n\nNumber of accidents / Total number of cars = 3 / 730,000\n\nThe probability of a car accident occurring on that road is approximately:\n\n3 / 730,000 ≈ 0.00000411\n\nSo, the probability of a car accident occurring on that road is approximately 0.000411% or 4.11 × 10^(-6)."
