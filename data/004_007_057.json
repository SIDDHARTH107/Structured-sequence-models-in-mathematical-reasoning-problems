    "message_2": "To find f'(3), we will first find the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x using the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x):\n\nf(x) = √(x^2 + 1)\nf'(x) = d(√(x^2 + 1))/dx = (1/2)(x^2 + 1)^(-1/2) * 2x = x/√(x^2 + 1)\n\ng(x) = 2x - 1\ng'(x) = d(2x - 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of f(g(x)) using the chain rule:\n\nf'(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = (g(x)/√(g(x)^2 + 1)) * 2\n\nNow we need to find f'(3). To do this, we will first find g(3):\n\ng(3) = 2(3) - 1 = 5\n\nNow we can find f'(3) by plugging g(3) into f'(g(x)):\n\nf'(3) = f'(g(3)) = (5/√(5^2 + 1)) * 2 = (5/√26) * 2 = 10/√26\n\nSo, f'(3) = 10/√26."
