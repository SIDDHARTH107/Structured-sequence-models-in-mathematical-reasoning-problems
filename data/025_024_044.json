    "message_2": "To compute the ring of invariants R^G, we need to find the polynomials in R that are invariant under the action of G. The group G has four elements: 1, -1, i, and -i. We will consider the action of each element on the polynomial ring R.\n\n1. The action of 1 on R does not change any of the variables, so every polynomial in R is invariant under the action of 1.\n\n2. The action of -1 on R changes the sign of each variable: x → -x, y → -y, and z → -z. A polynomial in R is invariant under this action if it has even powers of each variable. For example, x^2, y^2, z^2, and x^2y^2z^2 are invariant under the action of -1.\n\n3. The action of i on R permutes the variables cyclically: x → y, y → z, and z → x. A polynomial in R is invariant under this action if it is symmetric in x, y, and z. For example, x + y + z, xy + yz + zx, and xyz are invariant under the action of i.\n\n4. The action of -i on R permutes the variables in the opposite direction: x → z, y → x, and z → y. A polynomial in R is invariant under this action if it is symmetric in x, y, and z, just like in the case of i.\n\nNow, we need to find the polynomials that are invariant under all four actions. These polynomials must have even powers of each variable and be symmetric in x, y, and z. The simplest such polynomials are x^2 + y^2 + z^2, (xy + yz + zx)^2, and (xyz)^2.\n\nThe ring of invariants R^G is generated by these three polynomials, so R^G = C[x^2 + y^2 + z^2, (xy + yz + zx)^2, (xyz)^2]. The dimension of R^G is 3, as it is spanned by the three independent polynomials mentioned above."
