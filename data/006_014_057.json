    "message_1": "In a communication system, the probability of a message being transmitted correctly without any errors is 0.95. If 100 messages are transmitted, what is the probability that at least 5 messages will have errors?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 messages will have errors, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that 0 to 4 messages have errors. Then, we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least 5 messages have errors.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k errors\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of an error occurring (1 - 0.95 = 0.05)\n- n is the number of messages (100)\n- k is the number of errors (0 to 4)\n\nFirst, we'll find the probability of having 0 to 4 errors:\n\nP(0 errors) = C(100, 0) * 0.95^100 * 0.05^0\nP(1 error) = C(100, 1) * 0.95^99 * 0.05^1\nP(2 errors) = C(100, 2) * 0.95^98 * 0.05^2\nP(3 errors) = C(100, 3) * 0.95^97 * 0.05^3\nP(4 errors) = C(100, 4) * 0.95^96 * 0.05^4\n\nNow, we'll add these probabilities together:\n\nP(0 to 4 errors) = P(0 errors) + P(1 error) + P(2 errors) + P(3 errors) + P(4 errors)\n\nFinally, we'll find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 5 errors) = 1 - P(0 to 4 errors)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nP(0 errors) ≈ 0.00592\nP(1 error) ≈ 0.03116\nP(2 errors) ≈ 0.08118\nP(3 errors) ≈ 0.13956\nP(4 errors) ≈ 0.17814\n\nP(0 to 4 errors) ≈ 0.00592 + 0.03116 + 0.08118 + 0.13956 + 0.17814 ≈ 0.43596\n\nP(at least 5 errors) ≈ 1 - 0.43596 ≈ 0.56404\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 messages will have errors is approximately 0.564 or 56.4%."
