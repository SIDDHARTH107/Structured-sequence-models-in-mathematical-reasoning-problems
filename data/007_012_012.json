    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer greater than one for which Wilson's theorem does not hold, we need to find the smallest non-prime number and check if (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nThe smallest non-prime number greater than one is 4 (composite number). Now, let's check if Wilson's theorem holds for p = 4:\n\n(4-1)! + 1 = 3! + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSince 7 is not divisible by 4, Wilson's theorem does not hold for p = 4.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer greater than one for which Wilson's theorem does not hold is 4."
