    "message_2": "To determine if the graph has a Hamiltonian cycle, we can try to find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n\nLet's start at vertex 1 and try to find a Hamiltonian cycle:\n\n1. From vertex 1, we can go to vertices 2, 3, 6, or 7. Let's go to vertex 2.\n2. From vertex 2, we can go to vertices 1, 3, 6, or 7. Since we've already visited vertex 1, let's go to vertex 3.\n3. From vertex 3, we can go to vertices 1, 2, 4, or 7. We've already visited vertices 1 and 2, so let's go to vertex 4.\n4. From vertex 4, we can go to vertices 3, 5, or 7. We've already visited vertex 3, so let's go to vertex 5.\n5. From vertex 5, we can go to vertices 4, 6, or 7. We've already visited vertex 4, so let's go to vertex 6.\n6. From vertex 6, we can go to vertices 1, 2, 5, or 7. We've already visited vertices 1, 2, and 5, so let's go to vertex 7.\n7. From vertex 7, we can go to vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. We've already visited all of these vertices except for vertex 1, which is our starting vertex.\n\nSo, we have found a Hamiltonian cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 1."
