    "message_1": "Sure. Here's a problem for you:\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction at time t is given by the differential equation:\n\ndy/dt = 0.2(y - 50)t\n\nwhere y is the concentration of the reaction at time t. If the initial concentration of the reaction is 30 and it takes 5 minutes to reach a concentration of 60, what is the concentration at t=10 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to solve the given differential equation:\n\ndy/dt = 0.2(y - 50)t\n\nWe can solve this first-order linear differential equation using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y:\n\nIntegrating factor = e^(∫0.2t dt) = e^(0.1t^2)\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(0.1t^2) dy/dt + 0.2t e^(0.1t^2) y = 0.2t e^(0.1t^2)(y - 50)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt (y e^(0.1t^2)) = 0.2t e^(0.1t^2)(y - 50)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫ d(y e^(0.1t^2)) = ∫ 0.2t e^(0.1t^2)(y - 50) dt\n\ny e^(0.1t^2) = ∫ 0.2t e^(0.1t^2)(y - 50) dt + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition y(0) = 30:\n\n30 = C\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ny e^(0.1t^2) = ∫ 0.2t e^(0.1t^2)(y - 50) dt + 30\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when t = 5 and y = 60:\n\n60 e^(0.1(5)^2) = ∫ 0.2(5) e^(0.1(5)^2)(60 - 50) dt + 30\n\nSolving for the integral, we get:\n\n60 e^(12.5) = 5 e^(12.5) + 30\n\nNow, we can solve for the concentration y at t = 10 minutes:\n\ny e^(0.1(10)^2) = ∫ 0.2(10) e^(0.1(10)^2)(y - 50) dt + 30\n\ny e^(100) = 2 e^(100) + 30\n\nDivide both sides by e^(100):\n\ny = (2 e^(100) + 30) / e^(100)\n\ny ≈ 2 + 30 / e^(100)\n\ny ≈ 2\n\nSo, the concentration at t = 10 minutes is approximately 2."
