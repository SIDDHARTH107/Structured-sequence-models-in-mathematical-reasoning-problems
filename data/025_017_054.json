Prove that X has a minimal model. \n\nIn particular, let X be a non-singular projective surface over the field C of complex numbers with an ample divisor D on X. Suppose that -K_X.D > 0. If X is not a minimal model, then there exists a sequence of flops f_i: X_i → X_i+1 such that X_n is a minimal model. Find such a sequence of flops.",
    "message_2": "To prove that X has a minimal model, we will use the Minimal Model Program (MMP) for surfaces. The MMP is a process of simplifying the geometry of a variety by performing a sequence of birational transformations, such as flops, to obtain a minimal model. In the case of surfaces, the minimal model is a surface with Kodaira dimension either -∞, 0, 1, or 2.\n\nSince -K_X.D > 0, the surface X is of general type, meaning that its Kodaira dimension is 2. We will now show that X has a minimal model by performing a sequence of flops.\n\nLet X_0 = X. If X_0 is not a minimal model, there exists a curve C on X_0 such that C.K_X0 < 0. By the Cone Theorem, there exists an extremal curve R on X_0 such that R.C < 0. Since X_0 is a surface, R is a (-1)-curve, meaning that R^2 = -1 and R.K_X0 = -1.\n\nNow, we can perform a flop f_1: X_0 → X_1 by contracting the (-1)-curve R. The surface X_1 is still a non-singular projective surface, and by the negativity lemma, we have -K_X1.D > 0.\n\nWe can continue this process, constructing a sequence of flops f_i: X_i → X_i+1. At each step, we contract a (-1)-curve R_i on X_i, obtaining a new surface X_i+1 with -K_Xi+1.D > 0.\n\nThis process must terminate after a finite number of steps, say n, because the Picard number of the surfaces X_i is decreasing at each step. When the process terminates, we obtain a surface X_n with no (-1)-curves, and -K_Xn.D > 0. This surface X_n is a minimal model of X.\n\nIn summary, we have constructed a sequence of flops f_i: X_i → X_i+1 such that X_n is a minimal model of X. This shows that X has a minimal model, as desired."
