    "message_1": "A circular swimming pool has a diameter of 10 meters. What is the perimeter of the pool?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular pool, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nSince the diameter of the pool is 10 meters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 5 meters.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 5\nC ≈ 31.4159 * 5\nC ≈ 157.0795\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the pool is approximately 157.08 meters."
