    "message_1": "In a market, the probability of a consumer buying product A is 0.4, the probability of buying product B is 0.35 and the probability of buying both the products is 0.15. What is the probability of a consumer buying at least one of the products?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a consumer buying at least one of the products, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere P(A) is the probability of buying product A, P(B) is the probability of buying product B, and P(A ∩ B) is the probability of buying both products.\n\nPlugging in the given probabilities:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.4 + 0.35 - 0.15\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.6\n\nSo, the probability of a consumer buying at least one of the products is 0.6 or 60%."
