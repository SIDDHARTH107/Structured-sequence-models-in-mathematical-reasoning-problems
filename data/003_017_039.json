    "message_2": "To find the average temperature during the day from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, we need to integrate the temperature function T(t) over the interval [6, 18] and then divide by the length of the interval (12 hours).\n\nThe average temperature, A(t), can be found using the following formula:\n\nA(t) = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] T(t) dt\n\nIn this case, a = 6 and b = 18, so the formula becomes:\n\nA(t) = (1/12) * ∫[6, 18] (15sin(πt/12) + 20) dt\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of the temperature function:\n\n∫(15sin(πt/12) + 20) dt = 15∫sin(πt/12) dt + 20∫dt\n\nTo integrate sin(πt/12), we use substitution. Let u = πt/12, then du/dt = π/12, and dt = 12/π du.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n15∫sin(u) (12/π) du + 20∫dt = (180/π)∫sin(u) du + 20t\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\n(180/π)(-cos(u)) + 20t = (180/π)(-cos(πt/12)) + 20t\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the limits 6 and 18:\n\nA(t) = (1/12) * [(180/π)(-cos(π(18)/12)) + 20(18) - (180/π)(-cos(π(6)/12)) - 20(6)]\n\nA(t) = (1/12) * [(180/π)(-cos(3π/2)) + 360 - (180/π)(-cos(π/2)) - 120]\n\ncos(3π/2) = 0 and cos(π/2) = 0, so the expression simplifies to:\n\nA(t) = (1/12) * (360 - 120) = (1/12) * 240\n\nA(t) = 20\n\nSo, the average temperature during the day from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm is 20 degrees Celsius."
