    "message_2": "To determine the current passing through the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (B) produced by a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current passing through the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nWe are given B = 0.3 T and r = 5 cm = 0.05 m. We need to find the current I. Rearranging the equation to solve for I, we get:\n\nI = (B * 2 * π * r) / μ₀\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nI = (0.3 T * 2 * π * 0.05 m) / (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n\nI = (0.3 * 2 * π * 0.05) / (4π × 10^(-7))\n\nI ≈ (0.3 * 2 * 0.05) / (4 × 10^(-7))\n\nI ≈ 0.03 / (4 × 10^(-7))\n\nI ≈ 75000 A\n\nTherefore, the current passing through the wire is approximately 75,000 Amperes."
