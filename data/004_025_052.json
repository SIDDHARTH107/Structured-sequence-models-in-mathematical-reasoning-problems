    "message_1": "A particle moves along a straight line such that its position is given by the equation s(t) = 2t^3 - 9t^2 + 12t - 4, where s is in meters and t is in seconds. Find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at t = 3 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the particle, we need to find the first derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity function v(t):\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(2t^3 - 9t^2 + 12t - 4)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = 6t^2 - 18t + 12\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 3 seconds. Plug t = 3 into the velocity function:\n\nv(3) = 6(3)^2 - 18(3) + 12\nv(3) = 6(9) - 54 + 12\nv(3) = 54 - 54 + 12\nv(3) = 12\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at t = 3 seconds is 12 meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the particle. To do this, we'll find the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the acceleration function a(t):\n\na(t) = d^2s/dt^2 = d(v(t))/dt = d(6t^2 - 18t + 12)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\na(t) = 12t - 18\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at t = 3 seconds. Plug t = 3 into the acceleration function:\n\na(3) = 12(3) - 18\na(3) = 36 - 18\na(3) = 18\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle at t = 3 seconds is 18 meters per second squared.\n\nIn summary, at t = 3 seconds, the particle has a velocity of 12 meters per second and an acceleration of 18 meters per second squared."
