    "message_1": "Suppose a stream cipher uses a key stream of [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1] to encrypt the plaintext \"010101\". What would be the resulting ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "To find the resulting ciphertext, we need to perform a bitwise XOR operation between the plaintext and the key stream. Since the plaintext is \"010101\", we only need to consider the first 6 bits of the key stream, which are [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\nPlaintext:  0 1 0 1 0 1\nKey stream: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n----------------------\nCiphertext: 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"001111\"."
