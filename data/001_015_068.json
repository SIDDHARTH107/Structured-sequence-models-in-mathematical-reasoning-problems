    "message_2": "To solve the equation 5^(x+2) = 125, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite 125 as a power of 5, since 125 = 5^3.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n5^(x+2) = 5^3\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 5), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 2 = 3\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 3 - 2\nx = 1\n\nThe value of x that satisfies the equation is x = 1."
