    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature at the point P(1,1,sqrt(2)) on the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature K.\n\nThe given surface is a sphere with radius 2, centered at the origin. The equation of the sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface using spherical coordinates:\nx = 2sin(θ)cos(ϕ)\ny = 2sin(θ)sin(ϕ)\nz = 2cos(θ)\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nFirst fundamental form:\nE = <ru, ru> = <θx, θx> + <θy, θy> + <θz, θz>\nF = <ru, rv> = <θx, ϕx> + <θy, ϕy> + <θz, ϕz>\nG = <rv, rv> = <ϕx, ϕx> + <ϕy, ϕy> + <ϕz, ϕz>\n\nSecond fundamental form:\nL = <ruu, N> = <θθx, Nx> + <θθy, Ny> + <θθz, Nz>\nM = <ruv, N> = <θϕx, Nx> + <θϕy, Ny> + <θϕz, Nz>\nN = <rvv, N> = <ϕϕx, Nx> + <ϕϕy, Ny> + <ϕϕz, Nz>\n\nHere, ru and rv are the partial derivatives of the parameterization with respect to θ and ϕ, respectively. N is the unit normal vector to the surface.\n\nNow, we need to compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nSince the surface is a sphere, the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 1/R^2, where R is the radius of the sphere. In this case, R = 2, so K = 1/4.\n\nFinally, the sectional curvature at the point P(1,1,sqrt(2)) on the surface is equal to the Gaussian curvature K, which is 1/4."
