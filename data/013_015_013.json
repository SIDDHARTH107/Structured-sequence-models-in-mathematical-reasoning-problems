    "message_1": "Suppose a principal wants to hire an agent for a certain project. The agent can exert high or low effort, and the payoff to the principal will depend on the effort exerted by the agent. If the agent exerts high effort, the principal gets a payoff of 5, and if the agent exerts low effort, the principal gets a payoff of 2. The agent's payoff will depend on the effort exerted as well: if they exert high effort, they receive a payoff of 3, and if they exert low effort, they receive a payoff of 1. However, exerting high effort will cost the agent 2, whereas exerting low effort will cost nothing. What effort will the agent choose, and what will be the outcome of the game?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effort the agent will choose, we need to compare the net payoffs for both high and low effort.\n\nFor high effort:\nAgent's payoff = 3 (payoff for high effort) - 2 (cost of high effort) = 1\n\nFor low effort:\nAgent's payoff = 1 (payoff for low effort) - 0 (cost of low effort) = 1\n\nSince the net payoffs for both high and low effort are equal, the agent is indifferent between the two choices. However, in reality, agents may choose the option with the least effort required when indifferent. Therefore, the agent is more likely to choose low effort.\n\nThe outcome of the game will be:\n- Principal's payoff: 2 (payoff for agent's low effort)\n- Agent's payoff: 1 (net payoff for low effort)"
