    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of flipping heads exactly 5 times out of 10 flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, flipping heads) in n trials (flips)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (flipping heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (flipping tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the total number of trials (flips), which is 10 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (flipping heads), which is 5 in this case\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 5) = (10C5) * (0.5^5) * (0.5^(10-5))\n\nFirst, calculate 10C5:\n\n10C5 = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 10! / (5!5!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 252\n\nNow, calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = 252 * (0.5^5) * (0.5^5) = 252 * 0.03125 * 0.03125 â‰ˆ 0.246\n\nSo the probability of flipping heads exactly 5 times out of 10 flips is approximately 0.246 or 24.6%."
