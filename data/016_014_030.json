    "message_1": "What is the self-similarity dimension of the Lévy C curve, whose generating function is $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\right]$? Round off your answer to three decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The self-similarity dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nWhere D is the self-similarity dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, it is constructed by replacing each segment of the curve with two segments, each of which is half the length of the original segment. Therefore, N = 2 and s = 2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the self-similarity dimension:\n\nD = log(2) / log(2) = 1\n\nThe self-similarity dimension of the Lévy C curve is 1.000."
