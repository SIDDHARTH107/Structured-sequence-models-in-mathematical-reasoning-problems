    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nWe can rewrite this theorem as a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) when a is not divisible by p.\n\nIn this problem, we have a = 87, p = 23, and we want to find the remainder when 87^19 is divided by 23.\n\nFirst, let's check if 23 is a prime number. It is, as it has only two factors: 1 and 23.\n\nNow, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n87^(23-1) ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n87^22 ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n\nWe want to find the remainder when 87^19 is divided by 23. To do this, we can rewrite 87^19 as (87^22 * 87^(-3)):\n\n87^19 = 87^(22-3) = 87^22 * 87^(-3)\n\nNow, we know that 87^22 ≡ 1 (mod 23) from Fermat's Little Theorem. So, we can substitute this into our equation:\n\n87^19 ≡ 1 * 87^(-3) (mod 23)\n\nNow we need to find the modular inverse of 87^3 (mod 23). To do this, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or simply try different values until we find the inverse. In this case, the modular inverse of 87^3 (mod 23) is 8:\n\n87^3 * 8 ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our equation:\n\n87^19 ≡ 1 * 8 (mod 23)\n87^19 ≡ 8 (mod 23)\n\nSo, the remainder when 87^19 is divided by 23 is 8."
