    "message_1": "A ladder with a length of 10 ft leans against a wall. If the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 1 ft/sec, how fast is the base of the ladder moving away from the wall when the ladder is 6 ft above the ground? (Round your answer to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the height of the ladder on the wall. We are given that the ladder has a length of 10 ft, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nNow, we are given that the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 1 ft/sec, which means dy/dt = -1 ft/sec (negative because the height is decreasing). We want to find dx/dt when y = 6 ft.\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dx/dt:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2(6)(-1) = 0\n\nTo find the value of x when y = 6, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\nx^2 = 100 - 36\nx^2 = 64\nx = 8\n\nNow, plug in the value of x into the equation:\n\n2(8)(dx/dt) - 12 = 0\n16(dx/dt) = 12\ndx/dt = 12/16\ndx/dt = 0.75\n\nSo, the base of the ladder is moving away from the wall at a rate of 0.75 ft/sec when the ladder is 6 ft above the ground."
