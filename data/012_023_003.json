    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., the largest set of vertices in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). To find the clique number of graph G, we need to identify the largest complete subgraph in the given adjacency matrix.\n\nLet's analyze the adjacency matrix row by row:\n\n1. Row 1: Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 4.\n2. Row 2: Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n3. Row 3: Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n4. Row 4: Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n5. Row 5: Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.\n6. Row 6: Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 3, 5, and 7.\n7. Row 7: Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 4, 5, 6, and 8.\n8. Row 8: Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 5, 6, and 7.\n\nNow, let's look for the largest complete subgraph:\n\n- Vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a complete subgraph (a clique of size 4) since they are all connected to each other.\n- Vertices 5, 6, and 7 form a complete subgraph (a clique of size 3) since they are all connected to each other.\n- Vertices 5, 7, and 8 form a complete subgraph (a clique of size 3) since they are all connected to each other.\n\nThere are no larger complete subgraphs in the given adjacency matrix. Therefore, the clique number of graph G is 4."
