    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, a player A has been given $20 to split between themselves and player B. How much should player A offer to player B if the game is such that player B cannot reject the offer and both players get to keep the amount offered? Write down the payoff matrix for both players.",
    "message_2": "In a Dictator Game where player B cannot reject the offer, player A can choose any amount to offer player B, ranging from $0 to $20. Since player B has no power to reject the offer, player A may choose to maximize their own payoff by offering the minimum amount to player B. In this case, player A could offer $0 to player B and keep the entire $20 for themselves.\n\nThe payoff matrix for both players would look like this:\n\n```\nPlayer A's Offer:    $0    $1    $2    ...    $18    $19    $20\nPlayer A's Payoff:  $20   $19   $18   ...    $2     $1     $0\nPlayer B's Payoff:   $0    $1    $2    ...    $18    $19    $20\n```\n\nIn this matrix, each column represents a possible offer from player A to player B, and the corresponding payoffs for both players. Since player B cannot reject the offer, the optimal strategy for player A would be to offer $0 to player B and keep the entire $20 for themselves."
