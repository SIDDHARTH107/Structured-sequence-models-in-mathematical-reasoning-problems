Also, the boundary condition of the circular plate is given by:\n\nu(a,θ,t) = 0  for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π,\n\nwhere a is the radius of the circular plate.\n\nFind the temperature distribution u(x,y,t) at time t for this circular plate, given that a = 1 and t = 0.01.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of three functions, one depending on x, one depending on y, and one depending on t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the heat equation:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = (X''(x) / X(x)) + (Y''(y) / Y(y))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -μ\nY''(y) / Y(y) = -ν\n\nwhere λ = μ + ν.\n\nNow, we have three ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. T'(t) = -λT(t)\n2. X''(x) = -μX(x)\n3. Y''(y) = -νY(y)\n\nSolving equation 1 gives:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-λt)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nSolving equations 2 and 3 gives:\n\nX(x) = A cos(√μx) + B sin(√μx)\nY(y) = D cos(√νy) + E sin(√νy)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(a, θ, t) = 0 for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π\n\nThis implies that X(a) = 0. Since a = 1, we have:\n\nX(1) = A cos(√μ) + B sin(√μ) = 0\n\nTo satisfy this condition for all values of μ, we must have B = 0 and √μ = nπ for some integer n. Therefore, μ = n^2π^2 and:\n\nX(x) = A cos(nπx)\n\nSimilarly, we can find that Y(y) = D cos(mπy) for some integer m.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑ A_n,m cos(nπx) cos(mπy) Ce^(-λt)\n\nApplying the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = 10 cos(πx) cos(πy), we find that A_1,1 = 10 and all other coefficients A_n,m are zero. Therefore, the solution is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = 10 cos(πx) cos(πy) e^(-λt)\n\nTo find λ, we use the fact that λ = μ + ν = (n^2 + m^2)π^2. Since n = m = 1, λ = 2π^2. Finally, the temperature distribution at time t = 0.01 is:\n\nu(x, y, 0.01) = 10 cos(πx) cos(πy) e^(-2π^2 * 0.01)"
