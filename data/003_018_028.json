    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(5x) - 2cos(3x) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule.\n\nThe derivative of sin(ax) is acos(ax) * a, and the derivative of cos(ax) is -asin(ax) * a.\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = d(3sin(5x))/dx - d(2cos(3x))/dx\ndy/dx = 3 * 5cos(5x) - 2 * (-3)sin(3x)\ndy/dx = 15cos(5x) + 6sin(3x)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 15cos(5(π/6)) + 6sin(3(π/6))\ndy/dx(π/6) = 15cos(5π/6) + 6sin(3π/6)\ndy/dx(π/6) = 15cos(5π/6) + 6sin(π/2)\n\nNow, we will use the trigonometric values of cos(5π/6) and sin(π/2):\n\ncos(5π/6) = -√3/2\nsin(π/2) = 1\n\nSo, dy/dx(π/6) = 15(-√3/2) + 6(1)\ndy/dx(π/6) = -15√3/2 + 6\n\nThus, the derivative of y = 3sin(5x) - 2cos(3x) at x = π/6 is -15√3/2 + 6."
