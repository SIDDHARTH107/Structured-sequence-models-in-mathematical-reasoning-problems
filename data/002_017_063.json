    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular octagon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = 2 * (1 + √2) * (side length)^2\n\nGiven the side length of 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nArea = 2 * (1 + √2) * (5)^2\n\nArea = 2 * (1 + √2) * 25\n\nArea = 50 * (1 + √2)\n\nArea ≈ 50 * (1 + 1.414)\n\nArea ≈ 50 * 2.414\n\nArea ≈ 120.7 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular octagon is approximately 120.7 square centimeters."
