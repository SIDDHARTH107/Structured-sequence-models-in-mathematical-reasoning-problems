    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the tangent plane at the point (1, -1, 1).\n\nThe gradient of the function f(x, y) = x^2 - 2y^2 is given by:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (2x, -4y)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 1), the gradient is:\n\n∇f(1, -1) = (2, 4)\n\nThe tangent plane at the point (1, -1, 1) is given by the equation:\n\n2(x - 1) + 4(y + 1) - (z - 1) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second fundamental forms. Let's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - 2v^2)\n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -4v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = |<r_u, r_u>   <r_u, r_v>|\n    |<r_v, r_u>   <r_v, r_v>|\n\nI = |1 + 4u^2   -8uv|\n    |-8uv         1 + 16v^2|\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 1), we have:\n\nI = |5  8|\n    |8  17|\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form. The second partial derivatives are:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -8)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = |<r_uu, N>   <r_uv, N>|\n     |<r_uv, N>   <r_vv, N>|\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector to the surface at the point (1, -1, 1). We can find N by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (2u, -4v, 1)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 1), we have:\n\nN = (2, 4, 1)\n\nThe magnitude of N is:\n\n|N| = √(2^2 + 4^2 + 1^2) = √21\n\nSo, the unit normal vector is:\n\nN = (2/√21, 4/√21, 1/√21)\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form:\n\nII = |<r_uu, N>   <r_uv, N>|\n     |<r_uv, N>   <r_vv, N>|\n\nII = |2/√21   0|\n     |0       -8/√21|\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by finding the eigenvalues of the matrix product (-I^(-1) * II):\n\nI^(-1) = |17/89  -8/89|\n         |-8/89   5/89|\n\n-II = |-2/√21   0|\n      |0         8/√21|\n\n-I^(-1) * II = |(-2/√21)(17/89) + 0, (-2/√21)(-8/89) + 0|\n               |0 + 0, (-8/89)(0) + (5/89)(8/√21)|\n\n-I^(-1) * II = |(-34/√21*89)   (16/√21*89)|\n               |0              (40/√21*89)|\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are the principal curvatures k1 and k2:\n\nk1 = -34/(√21*89)\nk2 = 40/(√21*89)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1, -1, 1) are:\n\nk1 ≈ -0.0181\nk2 ≈ 0.0213"
