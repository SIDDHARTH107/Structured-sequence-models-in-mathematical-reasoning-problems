    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, we need to find the points where the gradient of $f$ is equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)$\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy$\n\nFor a critical point, both partial derivatives must be equal to zero:\n\n$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$\n\n$-6xy = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) $x = 0$: In this case, the first equation becomes $-3y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So, we have the critical point $(0,0)$.\n\n2) $y = 0$: In this case, the first equation becomes $3x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. But this case leads to the same critical point $(0,0)$ as in the first case.\n\nTherefore, there is only one critical point for the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, which is $(0,0)$. So, the number of critical points of $f$ on the Morse-Smale complex $M$ is 1."
