    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The given system can be represented as AX = B, where:\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 5  7  8 |\n    | 1  2  2 |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 20 |\n    |  6 |\n\nStep 1: LU decomposition of matrix A\nWe perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the upper triangular matrix U and keep track of the elimination factors to obtain the lower triangular matrix L.\n\nAfter the first step of Gaussian elimination, we have:\n\nL1 = | 1   0   0 |\n     | 2.5 1   0 |\n     | 0.5 0   1 |\n\nU1 = | 2  3   4  |\n     | 0  0.5 0  |\n     | 0  1   1.5|\n\nNow, we perform the second step of Gaussian elimination:\n\nL2 = | 1   0   0 |\n     | 2.5 1   0 |\n     | 0.5 2   1 |\n\nU2 = | 2  3   4  |\n     | 0  0.5 0  |\n     | 0  0   1  |\n\nSo, the LU decomposition of matrix A is:\n\nL = | 1   0   0 |\n    | 2.5 1   0 |\n    | 0.5 2   1 |\n\nU = | 2  3   4  |\n    | 0  0.5 0  |\n    | 0  0   1  |\n\nStep 2: Solve LY = B for Y\nWe have L = | 1   0   0 | and B = | 10 |, so we can solve for Y as follows:\n          | 2.5 1   0 |          | 20 |\n          | 0.5 2   1 |          |  6 |\n\n1 * Y1 = 10 => Y1 = 10\n2.5 * Y1 + Y2 = 20 => Y2 = 20 - 2.5 * 10 = -5\n0.5 * Y1 + 2 * Y2 + Y3 = 6 => Y3 = 6 - 0.5 * 10 + 2 * (-5) = 1\n\nSo, Y = | 10 |\n        | -5 |\n        |  1 |\n\nStep 3: Solve UX = Y for X\nWe have U = | 2  3   4 | and Y = | 10 |, so we can solve for X as follows:\n          | 0  0.5 0 |         | -5 |\n          | 0  0   1 |         |  1 |\n\n2 * X1 + 3 * X2 + 4 * X3 = 10\n0.5 * X2 = -5\nX3 = 1\n\nFrom the second equation, we get X2 = -5 / 0.5 = -10. Now, substituting the values of X2 and X3 in the first equation:\n\n2 * X1 - 30 + 4 = 10 => X1 = (10 + 30 - 4) / 2 = 18\n\nSo, X = | 18  |\n        | -10 |\n        |  1  |\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 18, y = -10, and z = 1."
