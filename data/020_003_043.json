    "message_2": "Let x be the number of bouquets the flower shop can sell. The objective is to maximize the profit, which is given by the function:\n\nP(x) = 20x\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n5x ≤ 80 (number of roses constraint)\n3x ≤ 60 (number of lilies constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThese constraints form a convex feasible region. To find the maximum profit, we can solve the problem graphically or algebraically.\n\nGraphically, we can plot the constraints and find the feasible region's vertices. The maximum profit will occur at one of these vertices.\n\nAlgebraically, we can solve the constraints for x:\n\n5x ≤ 80 => x ≤ 16\n3x ≤ 60 => x ≤ 20\n\nSince x must be non-negative, the feasible region is 0 ≤ x ≤ 16. The maximum profit will occur at one of the endpoints of this interval.\n\nAt x = 0, P(x) = 20(0) = $0\nAt x = 16, P(x) = 20(16) = $320\n\nThe maximum profit that the flower shop can earn is $320 by selling 16 bouquets."
