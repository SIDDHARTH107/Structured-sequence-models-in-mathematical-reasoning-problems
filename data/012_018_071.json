    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we want to create at least one isolated vertex.\n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles and has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In our case, a tree with 12 vertices would have 11 edges. Since G has 18 edges, it has 7 more edges than a tree with the same number of vertices.\n\nTo disconnect G, we can remove edges to create a tree and then remove one more edge to disconnect the tree. Therefore, we need to remove at least 7 edges (to make it a tree) + 1 edge (to disconnect the tree) = 8 edges. So, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 8."
