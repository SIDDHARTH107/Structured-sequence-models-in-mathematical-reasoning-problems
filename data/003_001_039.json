    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 15 cm and one leg of 9 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 15 cm) and one leg (a = 9 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe can plug in the given values:\n\n15^2 = 9^2 + b^2\n\n225 = 81 + b^2\n\nNow, we can subtract 81 from both sides of the equation:\n\n144 = b^2\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš144\n\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
