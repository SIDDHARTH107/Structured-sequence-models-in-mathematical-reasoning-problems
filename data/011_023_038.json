    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using graph theory. In this case, we are looking for the largest independent set in a 5-regular graph (a graph where each vertex has a degree of 5).\n\nThe largest independent set in a 5-regular graph can be found using the Lovász theta function, which is an upper bound for the size of the maximum independent set. The Lovász theta function for a d-regular graph is given by:\n\nθ(G) = n / (1 + d)\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices in the graph, and d is the degree of each vertex (in this case, 5).\n\nHowever, we don't know the total number of people (vertices) in the social network, so we cannot directly compute the Lovász theta function. Instead, we can look at the problem from a local perspective.\n\nLet's consider a person A in the social network. A is connected to 5 other people (B, C, D, E, and F). Since no two friends in the group can be directly connected, none of these 5 people can be part of the group. However, each of the friends of B, C, D, E, and F (excluding A) can potentially be part of the group.\n\nSince each of B, C, D, E, and F has 4 other friends (excluding A), there are a total of 5 * 4 = 20 people who are potential candidates for the group. However, we need to account for the overlap between the friends of B, C, D, E, and F. In the worst-case scenario, there is no overlap, and we can have a group of 20 friends.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of friends you can have in your group, where no two friends are directly connected, is 20."
