    "message_2": "To determine if G and H are isomorphic, we need to find a permutation matrix P such that P * G * P^T = H, where P^T is the transpose of P.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs:\n\nDegree sequence of G: [2, 3, 3, 2]\nDegree sequence of H: [3, 2, 3, 2]\n\nWe can see that both graphs have the same degree sequence, which is a necessary condition for isomorphism. Now, let's try to find a permutation matrix P that satisfies the condition P * G * P^T = H.\n\nWe can start by labeling the vertices of G and H as follows:\n\nG: v1 = (0, 1, 1, 0), v2 = (1, 0, 1, 1), v3 = (1, 1, 0, 1), v4 = (0, 1, 1, 0)\nH: w1 = (0, 1, 1, 1), w2 = (1, 0, 1, 0), w3 = (1, 1, 0, 1), w4 = (1, 0, 1, 0)\n\nWe can try to map v1 to w2 and v2 to w1 (since they have the same degrees):\n\nP = \n| 0 1 0 0 |\n| 1 0 0 0 |\n| 0 0 1 0 |\n| 0 0 0 1 |\n\nNow, let's compute P * G * P^T:\n\nP * G = \n| 1 0 1 1 |\n| 0 1 1 0 |\n| 1 1 0 1 |\n| 0 1 1 0 |\n\nP * G * P^T = \n| 0 1 1 1 |\n| 1 0 1 0 |\n| 1 1 0 1 |\n| 1 0 1 0 |\n\nWe can see that P * G * P^T = H, so the graphs G and H are isomorphic."
