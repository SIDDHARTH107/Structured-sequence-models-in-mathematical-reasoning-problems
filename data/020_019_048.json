    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of candies: Chocolate candies and Fruit candies. The manufacturer has 100 pounds of chocolate and 80 pounds of fruit. The profit per pound of chocolate candy is $6, and that of fruit candy is $5. The manufacturer wants to know how many pounds of each type of candy to produce to maximize profits. Write an optimal control problem to solve for the manufacturer.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of pounds of chocolate candy produced and y be the number of pounds of fruit candy produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 6x + 5y, subject to the constraints on the available chocolate and fruit.\n\nConstraints:\n1. x ≥ 0 (non-negative chocolate candy production)\n2. y ≥ 0 (non-negative fruit candy production)\n3. x ≤ 100 (limited chocolate supply)\n4. y ≤ 80 (limited fruit supply)\n\nThe optimal control problem can be formulated as follows:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 6x + 5y\nSubject to:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\nx ≤ 100\ny ≤ 80"
