    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the formula:\n\ngenus = (e - n + 2 - 2c) / 2\n\nwhere e is the number of edges, n is the number of vertices, and c is the number of connected components.\n\nFrom the given graph, we can count the number of vertices and edges:\n\nn = 10 (vertices)\ne = 15 (edges)\n\nSince the graph is connected, there is only one connected component:\n\nc = 1\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ngenus = (15 - 10 + 2 - 2 * 1) / 2\ngenus = (5) / 2\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest whole number:\n\ngenus = 3\n\nTherefore, the genus of the given graph is 3."
