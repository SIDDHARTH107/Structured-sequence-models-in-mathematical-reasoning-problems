    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 30 with 16 elements of order 3. We will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nFirst, note that the order of G is 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, which is the product of three distinct primes. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exist Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups of G. Let P2, P3, and P5 denote the Sylow 2-subgroup, Sylow 3-subgroup, and Sylow 5-subgroup of G, respectively. Then, |P2| = 2, |P3| = 3, and |P5| = 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n3, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n3 divides 10 and n3 = 1 or n3 = 10. Since there are 16 elements of order 3 in G, there must be 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, each contributing 2 non-identity elements of order 3. Therefore, n3 = 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n5, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n5 divides 6 and n5 = 1 or n5 = 6. If n5 = 6, then there would be 6 * 4 = 24 elements of order 5 in G. However, this is not possible since there are already 16 elements of order 3 in G, and the identity element is also in G. Therefore, n5 = 1, and there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P5, which is normal in G.\n\nSince P3 and P5 are both normal in G, their product P3P5 is also normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P3 and P5 are relatively prime, P3 âˆ© P5 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, by the product formula, |P3P5| = |P3| * |P5| = 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P3P5. Since |G/P3P5| = |G| / |P3P5| = 30 / 15 = 2, G/P3P5 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, C2. By the correspondence theorem, there exists a subgroup H of G such that H/P3P5 is isomorphic to C2. Since |H| = 2 * |P3P5| = 2 * 15 = 30, H must be equal to G.\n\nTherefore, G is an extension of the cyclic group C2 by the normal subgroup P3P5. There are three possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30. In this case, G is abelian and has a unique element of order 2. Since G has a subgroup isomorphic to C2, this possibility is valid.\n\n2. G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15. In this case, G is non-abelian and has 8 elements of order 2. Since G has a subgroup isomorphic to C2, this possibility is also valid.\n\n3. G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30. In this case, G is non-abelian and has 2 elements of order 2. Since G has a subgroup isomorphic to C2, this possibility is also valid.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 30 with 16 elements of order 3 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
