    "message_1": "A mathematical student is given the task to find the phase shift of the trigonometric function y = 2sin(x - 3π/4). What is the phase shift of the given function?",
    "message_2": "The phase shift of the given trigonometric function y = 2sin(x - 3π/4) can be found by looking at the term inside the sine function. The general form of a sine function is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, the phase shift is represented by C, which is 3π/4. Therefore, the phase shift of the given function is 3π/4."
