    "message_2": "To find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the system of equations, we first need to check if the system is consistent. Notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent, and the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nHowever, since the data is noisy with possible error of up to $\\pm0.2$ in each entry, we can find an approximate solution by considering the average of the three equations. Let's rewrite the system of equations as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} 2x+y=7.4 \\\\ 4x+2y=15.1 \\\\ 6x+3y=22.6 \\end{cases}$$\n\nDivide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} 2x+y=7.4 \\\\ 2x+y=7.55 \\\\ 2x+y=7.533 \\end{cases}$$\n\nNow, we can average the right-hand side values:\n\n$$\\frac{7.4 + 7.55 + 7.533}{3} = 7.494$$\n\nSo, the average equation is:\n\n$$2x + y = 7.494$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ and $y$. Let's express $y$ in terms of $x$:\n\n$$y = 7.494 - 2x$$\n\nWe can substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation of the original system:\n\n$$2x + (7.494 - 2x) = 7.4$$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n\n$$x = 0.047$$\n\nNow, we can find the value of $y$:\n\n$$y = 7.494 - 2(0.047) = 7.4$$\n\nSo, the approximate values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the system of equations are $x \\approx 0.047$ and $y \\approx 7.4$. Keep in mind that these values are approximate due to the noisy data, and the actual values may vary within the error range of $\\pm0.2$."
