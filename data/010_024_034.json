    "message_2": "To find the hyperbolic distance between two points in the Poincaré disk model, we can use the following formula:\n\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 2 * (||u - v||^2) / ((1 - ||u||^2) * (1 - ||v||^2)))\n\nwhere d(u, v) is the hyperbolic distance between points u and v, ||u - v|| is the Euclidean distance between u and v, and ||u|| and ||v|| are the Euclidean norms of u and v, respectively.\n\nLet u = (-5, 3) and v = (2, -7).\n\nFirst, we find the Euclidean distance between u and v:\n\n||u - v|| = sqrt((-5 - 2)^2 + (3 - (-7))^2) = sqrt(49 + 100) = sqrt(149)\n\nNext, we find the Euclidean norms of u and v:\n\n||u|| = sqrt((-5)^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34)\n||v|| = sqrt(2^2 + (-7)^2) = sqrt(4 + 49) = sqrt(53)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for the hyperbolic distance:\n\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 2 * (149) / ((1 - 34) * (1 - 53)))\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 2 * (149) / (-33 * -52))\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 298 / 1716)\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 0.17366)\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1.17366)\n\nThe hyperbolic distance between the points (-5, 3) and (2, -7) in the Poincaré disk model with unit radius is approximately arcosh(1.17366). To get a numerical value, we can use a calculator:\n\nd(u, v) ≈ 0.935"
