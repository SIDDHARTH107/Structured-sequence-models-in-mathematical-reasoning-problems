Find the magnetic field at a point P located 2 meters away from the wire.\n\nAssume that the wire is straight and infinitely long, and use the first of Maxwell's equations (also known as Gauss's law for magnetism) to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire is straight and infinitely long, we can simplify the problem by considering a small segment of the wire with length dx at a distance x from point P. The position vector r is given by:\n\nr = <x, -2>\n\nThe differential length vector dl is given by:\n\ndl = <dx, 0>\n\nNow, we can find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = <-2dx, 0>\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt(x^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(x^2 + 4)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * <-2dx, 0>) / (x^2 + 4)^(3/2)\n\nSince the wire is infinitely long, we need to integrate dB over the entire wire. The magnetic field B at point P is the sum of the contributions from all the current elements:\n\nB = ∫ dB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫ <-2dx, 0> / (x^2 + 4)^(3/2)\n\nWe only need to find the magnitude of B, so we can focus on the x-component:\n\nBx = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫ (-2dx) / (x^2 + 4)^(3/2)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet u = x^2 + 4, then du = 2xdx\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nBx = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫ (-1/2) du / u^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nBx = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (-1/2) * (2 / sqrt(u))\n\nSubstitute back for u:\n\nBx = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (-1) / sqrt(x^2 + 4)\n\nSince the wire is infinitely long, the limits of integration are from -∞ to +∞. However, due to symmetry, the magnetic field contributions from the segments on both sides of point P will cancel each other out, leaving only the vertical component of the magnetic field. Therefore, the magnetic field at point P is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (1 / 2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (4π * 2 m)\n\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / 2 m\n\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is 2.5 × 10^(-7) Tesla."
