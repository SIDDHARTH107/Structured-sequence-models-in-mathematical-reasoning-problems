    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C, denoted as B ∆ C. This is the set of elements which are in either of the sets B or C, but not in both.\n\nB ∆ C = {1, 3}\n\nNext, we will find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∆ C), denoted as A × (B ∆ C).\n\nA × (B ∆ C) = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A × B) and C, denoted as (A × B) ∆ C.
