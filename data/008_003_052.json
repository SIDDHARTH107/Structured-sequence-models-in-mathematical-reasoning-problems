    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix. \n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n0 & -1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 3 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nFirst, we can subtract the first row from the third row:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n0 & -1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNext, we can add the second row to the third row:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n0 & -1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that there are no rows of zeros, so the rank of the matrix A is equal to the number of rows, which is 3. Therefore, the rank of the matrix A is 3."
