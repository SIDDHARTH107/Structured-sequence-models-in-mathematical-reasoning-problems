    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of f(z) = z^2/(z^2 + 1) into the region inside the unit circle, we can make a substitution to rewrite the function in terms of a new variable that is well-behaved inside the unit circle.\n\nLet w = 1/z. Then z = 1/w, and |w| > 1 for |z| < 1. Now we can rewrite f(z) in terms of w:\n\nf(z) = (1/w)^2 / ((1/w)^2 + 1) = w^2 / (w^2 + 1).\n\nNow, let g(w) = w^2 / (w^2 + 1). This function is analytic inside the region |w| > 1, which corresponds to the region |z| < 1. Thus, g(w) is the analytic continuation of f(z) into the region inside the unit circle.\n\nTo express g(w) back in terms of z, we can substitute z = 1/w:\n\ng(z) = (1/z)^2 / ((1/z)^2 + 1) = z^2 / (z^2 + 1).\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of f(z) into the region inside the unit circle is the same function:\n\nf(z) = z^2 / (z^2 + 1)."
