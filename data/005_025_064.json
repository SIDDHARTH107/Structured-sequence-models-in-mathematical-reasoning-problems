    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturer claims that the mean weight of their cereal boxes is 400 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. A sample of 50 cereal boxes is taken from a shipment and the mean weight is found to be 395 grams. Is there evidence to suggest that the mean weight of the cereal boxes in the shipment is different from the claimed value at a significance level of 5%?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is evidence to suggest that the mean weight of the cereal boxes in the shipment is different from the claimed value at a significance level of 5%, we will perform a hypothesis test using the z-test.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The mean weight of the cereal boxes is equal to 400 grams (µ = 400).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The mean weight of the cereal boxes is not equal to 400 grams (µ ≠ 400).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Population mean (µ) = 400 grams\n- Population standard deviation (σ) = 10 grams\n- Sample mean (x̄) = 395 grams\n- Sample size (n) = 50\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) using the formula:\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 10 / √50 ≈ 1.414\n\nNext, we will calculate the z-score using the formula:\nz = (x̄ - µ) / SE\n\nz = (395 - 400) / 1.414 ≈ -3.536\n\nNow, we will compare the calculated z-score to the critical z-value at a 5% significance level (two-tailed test). The critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level is ±1.96.\n\nSince the calculated z-score (-3.536) is less than the critical z-value (-1.96), we reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence to suggest that the mean weight of the cereal boxes in the shipment is different from the claimed value of 400 grams at a significance level of 5%."
