    "message_2": "To find the particle's velocity, we need to find the first derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity function v(t):\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(2t^2 - 3t + 4)/dt\n\nUsing basic differentiation rules, we get:\n\nv(t) = 4t - 3\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 3 seconds:\n\nv(3) = 4(3) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9 m/s\n\nNext, to find the particle's acceleration, we need to find the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the acceleration function a(t):\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(4t - 3)/dt\n\nUsing basic differentiation rules, we get:\n\na(t) = 4\n\nSince the acceleration function is a constant, the acceleration at t = 3 seconds is the same as the acceleration at any other time:\n\na(3) = 4 m/s²\n\nSo, the particle's velocity at t = 3 seconds is 9 m/s, and its acceleration is 4 m/s²."
