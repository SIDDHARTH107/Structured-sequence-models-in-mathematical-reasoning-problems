    "message_2": "To find the number of possible combinations with 4 different colors of balls and each combination having exactly 2 balls, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (colors) and r is the number of items to be chosen (2 balls).\n\nIn this case, n = 4 and r = 2.\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!)\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!2!)\n\nC(4, 2) = (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(4, 2) = 24 / (4)\n\nC(4, 2) = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 possible combinations with 4 different colors of balls and each combination having exactly 2 balls."
