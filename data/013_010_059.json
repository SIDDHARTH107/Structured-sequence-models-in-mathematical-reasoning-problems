    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly where two firms produce identical goods. The market demand is given by P = 100 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. The firms have constant marginal costs of $20 per unit.\n\nIf the two firms choose their quantities simultaneously and independently, what quantity should each firm produce in order to maximize their profits? What will be the price of the good in the market and the total profits of each firm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction functions of both firms, which describe the optimal quantity each firm should produce given the quantity produced by the other firm. Let q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2.\n\nThe revenue for firm 1 is given by R1 = P * q1 = (100 - Q) * q1 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1. The cost for firm 1 is C1 = 20 * q1. The profit for firm 1 is then π1 = R1 - C1.\n\nTo find the optimal quantity for firm 1, we need to maximize its profit with respect to q1. To do this, we will take the first derivative of π1 with respect to q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π1)/dq1 = d((100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 20 * q1)/dq1 = 0\n\nExpanding and taking the derivative, we get:\n\n100 - 2*q1 - q2 - 20 = 0\n\nRearranging, we find the reaction function for firm 1:\n\nq1 = (80 - q2)/2\n\nSimilarly, we can find the reaction function for firm 2:\n\nq2 = (80 - q1)/2\n\nNow we need to find the Nash equilibrium, which is the point where both firms are playing their optimal strategies given the other firm's strategy. To do this, we will solve the system of equations formed by the reaction functions:\n\nq1 = (80 - q2)/2\nq2 = (80 - q1)/2\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nq1 = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\nq2 = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nSo, each firm should produce approximately 26.67 units to maximize their profits.\n\nNow let's find the price of the good in the market and the total profits of each firm. The market price is given by P = 100 - Q = 100 - (q1 + q2) = 100 - (80/3 + 80/3) = 100 - 160/3 ≈ 46.67.\n\nThe total revenue for each firm is R1 = R2 = P * q1 = 46.67 * 26.67 ≈ 1244.45. The total cost for each firm is C1 = C2 = 20 * 26.67 ≈ 533.33. Therefore, the total profit for each firm is π1 = π2 = R1 - C1 = R2 - C2 = 1244.45 - 533.33 ≈ 711.12.\n\nIn conclusion, each firm should produce approximately 26.67 units to maximize their profits. The market price will be approximately $46.67, and the total profit for each firm will be approximately $711.12."
