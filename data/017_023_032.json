    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Determine the possible divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups (p = 2):\n- n_2 must divide 3^2 = 9, so n_2 can be 1 or 9.\n- n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can only be 1.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups (p = 3):\n- n_3 must divide 2^3 = 8, so n_3 can be 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n- n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow subgroups: (n_2, n_3) = (1, 1), (1, 4).\n\nCase (1, 1): There is only one 2-Sylow subgroup and one 3-Sylow subgroup. This means that the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are both unique and normal. The group is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_9, which is an abelian group.\n\nCase (1, 4): There is only one 2-Sylow subgroup and four 3-Sylow subgroups. The 2-Sylow subgroup is normal, while the 3-Sylow subgroups are not. We can use the semidirect product to construct a non-abelian group. Let H be the 2-Sylow subgroup and K be one of the 3-Sylow subgroups. Then, the group is isomorphic to the semidirect product H ⋊ K, where the action of K on H is non-trivial.\n\nIn total, we have found two non-isomorphic groups of order 72: the abelian group Z_8 x Z_9 and the non-abelian group given by the semidirect product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups."
