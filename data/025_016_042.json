    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective surface in projective 4-space, with an ample divisor H such that h^0(H) = 3. Let f, g ∈ H^0(X, O_X(H)) be two linearly independent global sections defining a morphism f × g : X → ℙ^1 × ℙ^1. Compute the degree of the image of X under this morphism.",
    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the image of X under the morphism f × g, we will first find the degree of the morphism and then compute the degree of the image.\n\nSince f and g are linearly independent global sections of H^0(X, O_X(H)), they define a morphism φ: X → ℙ^2, given by φ(x) = [f(x):g(x):1]. The morphism f × g can be factored as X → ℙ^2 → ℙ^1 × ℙ^1, where the second map is the Segre embedding. The degree of the Segre embedding is 1, so we only need to compute the degree of φ.\n\nThe degree of φ is the intersection number of X with the pullback of a general hyperplane in ℙ^2. Let H' be a general hyperplane in ℙ^2. Then the pullback of H' under φ is φ^*(H') = H, since H is ample. Thus, the degree of φ is the intersection number X.H.\n\nNow, we need to compute X.H. Since X is a surface, this intersection number is the self-intersection number H^2. By the adjunction formula, we have:\n\nK_X = (K_{ℙ^4} + X)|_X = (-5H + X)|_X = -5H + X,\n\nwhere K_X and K_{ℙ^4} are the canonical divisors of X and ℙ^4, respectively. Since X is a surface, we have the following relation:\n\nK_X.H = (2g - 2) = -5H.H + X.H,\n\nwhere g is the geometric genus of X.\n\nNow, we need to find g. Since h^0(H) = 3, we have:\n\nχ(O_X(H)) = h^0(H) - h^1(H) + h^2(H) = 3.\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces, we have:\n\nχ(O_X(H)) = (1/2)H^2 + (1/2)K_X.H + χ(O_X) = (1/2)H^2 - (5/2)H.H + X.H + χ(O_X).\n\nThus, we have:\n\n3 = (1/2)H^2 - (5/2)H.H + X.H + χ(O_X).\n\nSince χ(O_X) = 1 - g, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n2g - 2 = -5H.H + X.H.\n\nNow, we can solve for X.H:\n\nX.H = 2g - 2 + 5H.H = H^2.\n\nFinally, the degree of the image of X under the morphism f × g is the degree of φ, which is X.H = H^2."
