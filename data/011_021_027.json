    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for all possible permutations of the cities and then choose the one with the shortest distance. Since there are 6 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) permutations, which is 120 possible routes. However, we can simplify this by considering that the route is a cycle, so we can fix the starting city and calculate the permutations for the remaining cities, which is 4! (4 factorial) or 24 possible routes.\n\nHere are the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> A: 5 + 7 + 6 + 2 + 1 = 21\n2.
