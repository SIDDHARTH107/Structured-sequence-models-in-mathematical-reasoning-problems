    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cylindrical container, we need to find the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nFirst, let's find the surface area of one circular base. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the diameter is 8 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 4 cm.\n\nA = π(4^2)\nA = π(16)\nA = 16π\n\nSince there are two circular bases, we multiply the area by 2:\n\n2 * 16π = 32π\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the lateral surface area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nA = 2π(4)(10)\nA = 80π\n\nFinally, we add the surface area of the two bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 32π + 80π = 112π\n\nTo round to the nearest tenth, we can approximate π as 3.14:\n\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 112 * 3.14 = 351.68\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylindrical container is approximately 351.7 cm² when rounded to the nearest tenth."
