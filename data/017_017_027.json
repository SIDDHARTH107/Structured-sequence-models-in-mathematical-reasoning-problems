    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C30 or D15, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the order of G is 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. \n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 6 (the index of 5 in 30) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Let P_5 be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since it is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 10 (the index of 3 in 30) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or 10. If n_3 = 1, let P_3 be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, consider the product of the normal subgroups P_3 and P_5. Since their orders are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_3 ∩ P_5 = {e}. By the product formula, we have:\n\n|P_3 * P_5| = |P_3| * |P_5| / |P_3 ∩ P_5| = 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nSince P_3 and P_5 are normal in G, their product P_3 * P_5 is also normal in G. Moreover, G has a subgroup of order 15, which is normal. If n_3 = 1, then G has a normal subgroup of order 15, and G is a semidirect product of P_3 and P_5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, as C30 is the only group of order 30 with a normal subgroup of order 15.\n\nNow, suppose n_3 = 10. In this case, there is no unique 3-Sylow subgroup, and G does not have a normal subgroup of order 15. However, G still has a normal 5-Sylow subgroup P_5. Let P_2 be a 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Since |P_2| = 2, P_2 is isomorphic to C2.\n\nConsider the semidirect product of P_5 and P_2. Since P_5 is normal in G, we have a homomorphism φ: P_2 → Aut(P_5), where Aut(P_5) denotes the automorphism group of P_5. Note that |Aut(P_5)| = 4, as P_5 is isomorphic to C5, and the automorphism group of a cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the group of units modulo n, which in this case is C4.\n\nSince |P_2| = 2, the homomorphism φ must map P_2 to an element of order 2 in Aut(P_5). There are two possibilities: either φ is trivial, or φ maps P_2 to the unique element of order 2 in Aut(P_5). In the first case, the semidirect product is a direct product, and G is isomorphic to C30. In the second case, the semidirect product is not a direct product, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30 or the dihedral group D15."
