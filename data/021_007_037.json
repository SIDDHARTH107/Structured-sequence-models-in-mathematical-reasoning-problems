    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe are given the initial approximation x0 = 1.5. We will iterate the Newton-Raphson method until we reach the desired accuracy of four decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 1.5 - (1.5^3 - 2*1.5 - 2) / (3*(1.5^2) - 2)\nx1 = 1.5 - (3.375 - 3 - 2) / (6.75 - 2)\nx1 = 1.5 - (-1.625) / 4.75\nx1 ≈ 1.8411\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 1.8411 - (1.8411^3 - 2*1.8411 - 2) / (3*(1.8411^2) - 2)\nx2 ≈ 1.7693\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = 1.7693 - (1.7693^3 - 2*1.7693 - 2) / (3*(1.7693^2) - 2)\nx3 ≈ 1.7693\n\nSince x3 and x2 are the same up to four decimal places, we can conclude that the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 = 0 is approximately x ≈ 1.7693."
