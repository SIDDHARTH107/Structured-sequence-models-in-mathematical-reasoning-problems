    "message_2": "In mirror symmetry, the Hodge numbers of a Calabi-Yau manifold and its mirror are related as follows:\n\nh^{1,1}(M) = h^{2,1}(M') and h^{2,1}(M) = h^{1,1}(M')\n\nwhere M is the original Calabi-Yau manifold, M' is its mirror, and h^{p,q} denotes the Hodge numbers.\n\nGiven the Hodge numbers h^{1,1}(M) = 10 and h^{2,1}(M) = 100, we can use the mirror symmetry relations to find the Hodge numbers of the mirror Calabi-Yau manifold M':\n\nh^{1,1}(M') = h^{2,1}(M) = 100\nh^{2,1}(M') = h^{1,1}(M) = 10\n\nThe number of Kähler moduli of a Calabi-Yau manifold is given by its h^{1,1} Hodge number. Therefore, the number of Kähler moduli of the mirror Calabi-Yau manifold M' is h^{1,1}(M') = 100."
