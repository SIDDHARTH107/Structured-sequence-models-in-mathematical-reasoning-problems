    "message_2": "Let G be a finite group of order 9. Since 9 = 3^2, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say P, of order 3^2 = 9. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have that n_3 divides the order of G, and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 9, the only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which is P. Since P has order 9 and is a subgroup of G, we have that P = G. Thus, G is a p-group of order 3^2, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. However, C3 × C3 has elements of order 1, 3, and 9, while G has elements of order 3. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIn this case, there are three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Each of these subgroups has 9 - 1 = 8 non-identity elements, and since the subgroups are distinct, they intersect only at the identity element. Thus, there are a total of 3 × 8 = 24 non-identity elements in these subgroups. However, this is a contradiction, as G has only 9 - 1 = 8 non-identity elements.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
