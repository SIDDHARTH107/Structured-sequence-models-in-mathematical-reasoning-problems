    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its reduced row echelon form (RREF).\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations is:\n\n| 1  1  1 | 4 |\n| 2  4  1 | 2 |\n| 3  5  1 | 1 |\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1   1 |  4  |\n| 0  2  -1 | -6  |\n| 0  2  -2 | -11 |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by 2:\n\n| 1  1   1 |  4  |\n| 0  1  -0.5 | -3  |\n| 0  2  -2 | -11 |\n\nStep 3: Subtract 2 times the second row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1   1 |  4  |\n| 0  1  -0.5 | -3  |\n| 0  0  -1 | -5 |\n\nStep 4: Multiply the third row by -1:\n\n| 1  1   1 |  4  |\n| 0  1  -0.5 | -3  |\n| 0  0   1 |  5 |\n\nStep 5: Add 0.5 times the third row to the second row, and subtract the third row from the first row:\n\n| 1  1  0 | -1 |\n| 0  1  0 | -0.5 |\n| 0  0  1 |  5 |\n\nStep 6: Subtract the second row from the first row:\n\n| 1  0  0 | -1.5 |\n| 0  1  0 | -0.5 |\n| 0  0  1 |  5 |\n\nThe reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix corresponds to the following system of linear equations:\n\nx = -1.5\ny = -0.5\nz = 5\n\nSo the solution to the non-homogeneous system of linear equations is (x, y, z) = (-1.5, -0.5, 5)."
