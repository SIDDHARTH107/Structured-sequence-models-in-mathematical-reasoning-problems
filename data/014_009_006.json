    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how a Feistel cipher works and then apply the given information to encrypt the plaintext block.\n\nA Feistel cipher is a symmetric key block cipher that divides the plaintext block into two equal halves, left and right. It then applies a round function to one half (usually the right half) using a round key and XORs the result with the other half (usually the left half). The halves are then swapped for the next round. After the final round, the halves are combined to form the ciphertext block.\n\nGiven:\n- Key length: 8 bits\n- Block length: 16 bits\n- Number of rounds: 4\n- Fixed round key: 10 bits (not used in this problem since the key length is 8 bits)\n- Plaintext block: 0x6A95\n\nLet's perform the encryption using the Feistel cipher:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext block into two equal halves:\n   L0 = 0x6A (left half)\n   R0 = 0x95 (right half)\n\n2. Perform 4 rounds of encryption:\n\n   Note: Since the actual round function and round keys are not provided, we will use a generic round function F and round keys Ki.\n\n   Round 1:\n   L1 = R0\n   R1 = L0 XOR F(R0, K1)\n\n   Round 2:\n   L2 = R1\n   R2 = L1 XOR F(R1, K2)\n\n   Round 3:\n   L3 = R2\n   R3 = L2 XOR F(R2, K3)\n\n   Round 4:\n   L4 = R3\n   R4 = L3 XOR F(R3, K4)\n\n3. Combine the final left and right halves to form the ciphertext block:\n   Ciphertext = L4 || R4\n\nSince we don't have the actual round function F and round keys Ki, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext block. However, the process outlined above is how the Feistel cipher would be applied to encrypt the given plaintext block."
