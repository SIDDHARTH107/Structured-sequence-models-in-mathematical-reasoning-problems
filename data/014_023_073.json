    "message_1": "Assume that a Rail fence cipher is encoded using the key value of 4 and the message \"HELLO WORLD\". Find the ciphertext generated by this encryption technique.",
    "message_2": "A Rail Fence cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the plaintext letters by writing them in a zigzag pattern along a set number of \"rails\" (rows). In this case, the key value is 4, which means we will use 4 rails. Let's write the message \"HELLO WORLD\" in a zigzag pattern along 4 rails:\n\nH       O       L\n  E   L   W   R   D\n    L       O\n      O\n\nNow, let's read the ciphertext row by row:\n\nHOLELWRDLOO\n\nSo, the ciphertext generated by the Rail Fence cipher with a key value of 4 for the message \"HELLO WORLD\" is \"HOLELWRDLOO\"."
