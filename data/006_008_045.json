    "message_2": "To find the probability of two consecutive days of sunshine, we need to multiply the probability of sunshine on the first day by the probability of sunshine on the second day. Since the probability of sunshine on any given day is 0.7, the calculation is as follows:\n\nProbability of sunshine on Day 1 = 0.7\nProbability of sunshine on Day 2 = 0.7\n\nProbability of two consecutive days of sunshine = (Probability of sunshine on Day 1) * (Probability of sunshine on Day 2) = 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49\n\nSo, the probability of getting two consecutive days of sunshine is 0.49 or 49%."
