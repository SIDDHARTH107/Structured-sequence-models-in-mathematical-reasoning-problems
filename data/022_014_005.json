    "message_2": "A harmonic function is a twice continuously differentiable function that satisfies Laplace's equation, which states that the Laplacian of the function is zero. In other words, a function $f(z)$ is harmonic if its Laplacian $\\nabla^2f = 0$. \n\nSince $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$, we need to find the Laplacian of $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ separately. The Laplacian of a scalar function in Cartesian coordinates is given by:\n\n$$\\nabla^2u = \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2}$$\n$$\\nabla^2v = \\frac{\\partial^2v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2v}{\\partial y^2}$$\n\nNow, we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$$\n\nDifferentiating the first Cauchy-Riemann equation with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y}$$\n\nDifferentiating the second Cauchy-Riemann equation with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y \\partial x}$$\n\nAdding these two equations, we obtain:\n\n$$\\nabla^2u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0$$\n\nSimilarly, differentiating the first Cauchy-Riemann equation with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x \\partial y}$$\n\nDifferentiating the second Cauchy-Riemann equation with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y \\partial x}$$\n\nAdding these two equations, we obtain:\n\n$$\\nabla^2v = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x \\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0$$\n\nSince both $\\nabla^2u = 0$ and $\\nabla^2v = 0$, we can conclude that the Laplacian of the complex-valued function $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ is also zero:\n\n$$\\nabla^2f = \\nabla^2(u + iv) = \\nabla^2u + i\\nabla^2v = 0 + i0 = 0$$"
