    "message_1": "If a triangle has one angle measuring 30 degrees and the hypotenuse is 10 cm long, what are the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "This is a 30-60-90 triangle, which has side lengths in the ratio of 1:√3:2. Since the hypotenuse is given as 10 cm, we can find the lengths of the other two sides by dividing the hypotenuse by 2.\n\n10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nSo, one side (opposite to the 30-degree angle) is 5 cm long. To find the length of the other side (opposite to the 60-degree angle), we can multiply the 5 cm side by √3.\n\n5 cm * √3 ≈ 8.66 cm\n\nThus, the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle are approximately 5 cm and 8.66 cm."
