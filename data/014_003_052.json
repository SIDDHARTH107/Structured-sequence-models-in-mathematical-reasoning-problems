    "message_1": "Suppose the prime number `p` is 13, the primitive root `a` is 3, and the secret key `d` is 5. If the message to be sent is 9, what is the ciphertext `c` produced using ElGamal encryption?",
    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext `c` using ElGamal encryption, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the public key `h`: h = a^d mod p\n2. Choose a random integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ p-2. For simplicity, let's choose k = 2.\n3. Compute the first part of the ciphertext `c1`: c1 = a^k mod p\n4. Compute the second part of the ciphertext `c2`: c2 = (message * h^k) mod p\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n1. h = 3^5 mod 13 = 243 mod 13 = 3\n2. k = 2 (already chosen)\n3. c1 = 3^2 mod 13 = 9 mod 13 = 9\n4. c2 = (9 * 3^2) mod 13 = (9 * 9) mod 13 = 81 mod 13 = 3\n\nSo, the ciphertext `c` is the pair (c1, c2) = (9, 3)."
