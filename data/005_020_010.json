    "message_1": "Suppose a basketball player has a free throw success rate of 70% and attempts 100 free throws in a game. Using Monte Carlo simulation, estimate the probability that the player makes at least 75% of their free throws in the game.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the probability using Monte Carlo simulation, we will simulate the player's free throw attempts multiple times and count the number of times they make at least 75% of their free throws. Here's the process:\n\n1. Set the success rate to 0.7 (70%).\n2. Set the number of free throw attempts to 100.\n3. Set the number of simulations to a large number, such as 10,000.\n4. Initialize a counter for successful simulations to 0.\n5. For each simulation, generate 100 random numbers between 0 and 1. If a random number is less than or equal to 0.7, consider it a successful free throw.\n6. Count the number of successful free throws in each simulation.\n7. If the number of successful free throws is at least 75 (75% of 100), increment the successful simulations counter.\n8. After all simulations are complete, divide the successful simulations counter by the total number of simulations to get the estimated probability.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nsuccess_rate = 0.7\nfree_throw_attempts = 100\nnum_simulations = 10000\nsuccessful_simulations = 0\n\nfor _ in range(num_simulations):\n    successful_free_throws = sum([1 for _ in range(free_throw_attempts) if random.random() <= success_rate])\n    if successful_free_throws >= 75:\n        successful_simulations += 1\n\nestimated_probability = successful_simulations / num_simulations\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, the estimated probability will be stored in the `estimated_probability` variable. The actual value may vary slightly due to the random nature of the simulation, but it should give a good approximation of the probability that the player makes at least 75% of their free throws in the game."
