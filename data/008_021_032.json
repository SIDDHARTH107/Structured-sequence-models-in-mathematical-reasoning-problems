    "message_2": "A singular matrix is a matrix that does not have an inverse, which means that the system of linear equations has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. In this case, we can determine the nature of the solution by examining the given system of linear equations.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the system by dividing each equation by their greatest common divisor:\n\n1. x + 2y - 3z = 5\n2. x + 2y - 3z = 5 (dividing the second equation by 2)\n3. x + 2y - 3z = 5 (dividing the third equation by 3)\n\nNow, we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, as all three planes represented by the equations coincide. To express the solution in terms of a parameter, we can solve for one variable and express the other two in terms of that variable.\n\nLet's solve for z in terms of x and y using the first equation:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 5\n3z = x + 2y - 5\nz = (x + 2y - 5)/3\n\nNow we have z in terms of x and y. The solution to this system of linear equations is any combination of x, y, and z that satisfies the equation z = (x + 2y - 5)/3."
