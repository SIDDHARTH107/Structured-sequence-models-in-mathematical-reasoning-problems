    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces light bulbs and packages them in boxes of 25. A quality control inspector selects a random sample of 15 boxes of light bulbs and finds that the average lifespan of bulbs in these 15 boxes is 990 hours with a standard deviation of 20 hours. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of light bulbs produced by the company?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of light bulbs produced by the company, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean (average lifespan of bulbs in the 15 boxes)\nt = t-score (based on the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom)\ns = sample standard deviation\nn = sample size (number of boxes)\n\nGiven:\nx̄ = 990 hours\ns = 20 hours\nn = 15 boxes\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score. Since we want a 95% confidence interval and we have a sample size of 15, we have 14 degrees of freedom (n - 1). Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 14 degrees of freedom is approximately 2.145.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 990 ± (2.145 * (20 / √15))\nConfidence Interval = 990 ± (2.145 * (20 / 3.872))\nConfidence Interval = 990 ± (2.145 * 5.162)\n\nConfidence Interval = 990 ± 11.07\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of light bulbs produced by the company is approximately (978.93, 1001.07) hours."
