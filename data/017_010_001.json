    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10, we will first find the number of elements of order 2 in G. \n\nSince G has order 10, by the Sylow Theorems, G has a subgroup of order 5 (a Sylow 5-subgroup) and a subgroup of order 2 (a Sylow 2-subgroup). Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 2.\n\nSince the order of P is 5, which is prime, P is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Similarly, since the order of Q is 2, Q is cyclic and isomorphic to C2. Let x be a generator of P and y be a generator of Q. Then, the order of x is 5 and the order of y is 2.\n\nNow, we consider the product PQ. Since |P ∩ Q| = 1 (the identity element), we have |PQ| = |P||Q| = 10, which implies that PQ = G. Thus, every element in G can be written as a product of elements from P and Q.\n\nWe will now count the number of elements of order 2 in G. We know that y has order 2. If x^i * y has order 2 for some i (1 ≤ i ≤ 4), then (x^i * y)^2 = x^(2i) * y^2 = e (the identity element). Since y^2 = e, we have x^(2i) = e, which implies that 5 divides 2i. However, this is not possible since 5 is relatively prime to 2. Therefore, there are no other elements of order 2 in G that can be written as x^i * y.\n\nThus, G has exactly one element of order 2, which is the generator of the Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of G:\n\n1. If G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to C10, since it has an element of order 5 (the generator of P) and an element of order 2 (the generator of Q).\n\n2. If G is non-abelian, then G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10, which is the semidirect product of P and Q. In this case, G has the presentation ⟨x, y | x^5 = y^2 = e, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)⟩.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to D5, the dihedral group of order 10, then G has the presentation ⟨x, y | x^5 = y^2 = e, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)⟩. This is the same presentation as the non-abelian group of order 10, so these two groups are isomorphic.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10, and there is exactly one element of order 2 in G."
