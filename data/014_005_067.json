    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a digital message to Bob with a digital signature. She uses the ElGamal signature scheme with parameters (p=23, g=5, x=7) where p is a prime number, g is a primitive root modulo p and x is Alice's private key. Alice's message is represented with the number m = 11. \n\nWhat values should Alice calculate to produce a valid digital signature for her message m, and how can Bob verify the signature using Alice's public key?",
    "message_2": "First, Alice needs to calculate her public key y. She can do this using the formula y = g^x mod p:\n\ny = 5^7 mod 23\ny = 78125 mod 23\ny = 17\n\nNow, Alice's public key is y = 17.\n\nTo create a digital signature for her message m = 11, Alice needs to choose a random number k (1 < k < p-1) that is relatively prime to p-1. Let's assume Alice chooses k = 6.\n\nNext, Alice calculates r and s using the following formulas:\n\nr = g^k mod p\ns = (m - xr) * k^(-1) mod (p-1)\n\nCalculating r:\n\nr = 5^6 mod 23\nr = 15625 mod 23\nr = 10\n\nCalculating s:\n\ns = (11 - 7 * 10) * 6^(-1) mod 22\ns = (-59) * 6^(-1) mod 22\ns = 13 * 6^(-1) mod 22 (since -59 mod 22 = 13)\ns = 13 * 18 mod 22 (since the modular inverse of 6 mod 22 is 18)\ns = 234 mod 22\ns = 2\n\nNow, Alice's digital signature for her message m = 11 is (r, s) = (10, 2).\n\nTo verify the signature, Bob uses Alice's public key y and the following equations:\n\nv1 = y^r mod p\nv2 = r^s mod p\nv = (v1 * v2) mod p\n\nCalculating v1, v2, and v:\n\nv1 = 17^10 mod 23\nv1 = 20159939004567201 mod 23\nv1 = 9\n\nv2 = 10^2 mod 23\nv2 = 100 mod 23\nv2 = 8\n\nv = (9 * 8) mod 23\nv = 72 mod 23\nv = 3\n\nFinally, Bob checks if v is equal to g^m mod p:\n\ng^m mod p = 5^11 mod 23 = 48828125 mod 23 = 3\n\nSince v = 3 and g^m mod p = 3, the signature is valid, and Bob can trust that the message m = 11 was sent by Alice."
