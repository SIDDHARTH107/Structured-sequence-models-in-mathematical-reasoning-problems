    "message_2": "To find the car's velocity, we need to find the first derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity function v(t).\n\ns(t) = 5t^2 + 10t + 2\n\nTaking the first derivative with respect to t:\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = 10t + 10\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at t = 2 seconds by plugging t = 2 into the velocity function:\n\nv(2) = 10(2) + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 m/s\n\nTo find the car's acceleration, we need to find the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the acceleration function a(t).\n\nWe already have the first derivative (velocity function) v(t) = 10t + 10. Now, we'll take the derivative of v(t) with respect to t:\n\na(t) = dv/dt = 10\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, which means the acceleration is the same at any time. Therefore, the car's acceleration at t = 2 seconds is:\n\na(2) = 10 m/s²\n\nSo, the car's velocity at 2 seconds is 30 m/s and its acceleration is 10 m/s²."
