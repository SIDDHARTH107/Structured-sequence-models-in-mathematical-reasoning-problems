    "message_1": "Suppose that there are three bidders for an item being sold in a first-price sealed-bid auction. The bidders' valuations of the item are $v_1=10$, $v_2=15$, and $v_3=20$, respectively. What is the expected revenue for the seller if the auction is conducted as a second-price sealed-bid auction?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the item but pays the second-highest bid. To calculate the expected revenue for the seller, we need to consider all possible bid combinations and their probabilities.\n\nLet's denote the bids of the three bidders as $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$. Since the bidders are rational, they will not bid more than their valuations. Therefore, the possible bids for each bidder are:\n\n- Bidder 1: $b_1 \\leq 10$\n- Bidder 2: $b_2 \\leq 15$\n- Bidder 3: $b_3 \\leq 20$\n\nNow let's consider the different cases for the highest and second-highest bids:\n\n1. Bidder 3 wins, and bidder 2 is the second-highest bidder:\n   - $b_3 > b_2 > b_1$\n   - The revenue in this case is $b_2$.\n\n2. Bidder 3 wins, and bidder 1 is the second-highest bidder:\n   - $b_3 > b_1 > b_2$\n   - The revenue in this case is $b_1$.\n\n3. Bidder 2 wins, and bidder 1 is the second-highest bidder:\n   - $b_2 > b_1 > b_3$\n   - The revenue in this case is $b_1$.\n\nSince the bidders are rational, they will bid their true valuations in a second-price sealed-bid auction. This is because bidding higher than their valuation would risk overpaying, and bidding lower would risk losing the auction without reaching their true valuation. Therefore, we can assume that $b_1 = 10$, $b_2 = 15$, and $b_3 = 20$.\n\nNow let's analyze the expected revenue for each case:\n\n1. Bidder 3 wins, and bidder 2 is the second-highest bidder:\n   - $20 > 15 > 10$\n   - The revenue in this case is $15$.\n\n2. Bidder 3 wins, and bidder 1 is the second-highest bidder:\n   - $20 > 10 > 15$ (This case is not possible, as $10 > 15$ is false)\n\n3. Bidder 2 wins, and bidder 1 is the second-highest bidder:\n   - $15 > 10 > 20$ (This case is not possible, as $10 > 20$ is false)\n\nThe only possible case is the first one, where bidder 3 wins, and bidder 2 is the second-highest bidder. In this case, the revenue for the seller is $15. Therefore, the expected revenue for the seller in a second-price sealed-bid auction is $15."
