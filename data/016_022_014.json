    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid (also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle 3D) is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nIn the 5th iteration, the number of tetrahedra can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of tetrahedra = 4^5 = 1024\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of triangles in these 1024 tetrahedra. Each tetrahedron has 4 faces, and each face is a triangle. So, the total number of triangles in the 5th iteration is:\n\nTotal triangles = 1024 tetrahedra * 4 triangles/tetrahedron = 4096 triangles"
