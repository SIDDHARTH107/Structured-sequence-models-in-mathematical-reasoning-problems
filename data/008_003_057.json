    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to get it into row-echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 3 & -1 \\\\ 3 & 4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFirst, we can subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -7 \\\\ 0 & -2 & -8 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we can multiply the second row by -1 to make the leading entry positive:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 7 \\\\ 0 & -2 & -8 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we can add 2 times the second row to the third row:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 7 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form, and we can see that all rows are non-zero. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is 3."
