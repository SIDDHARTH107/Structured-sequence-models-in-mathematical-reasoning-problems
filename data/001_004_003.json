    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial x^2 + 9x + 14, we need to find two binomials whose product equals the given polynomial. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to 14 (the constant term) and add up to 9 (the coefficient of the linear term).\n\nThe two numbers that meet these conditions are 2 and 7, since 2 * 7 = 14 and 2 + 7 = 9.\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is (x + 2)(x + 7)."
