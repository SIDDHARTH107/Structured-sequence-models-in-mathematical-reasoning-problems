He wants to arrange them in crates such that each crate contains the same number of each type of fruit. What is the minimum number of crates Ahmed needs to use? Use the Chinese remainder theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we need to find the smallest number x that satisfies the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 328 (mod a)\nx ≡ 473 (mod b)\nx ≡ 615 (mod c)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the number of apples, bananas, and oranges per crate, respectively. Since Ahmed wants to minimize the number of crates, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three quantities of fruits.\n\nThe GCD of 328, 473, and 615 is the smallest number that divides all three numbers. Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nGCD(328, 473) = 1\nGCD(328, 615) = 1\nGCD(473, 615) = 1\n\nSince the GCD of all pairs is 1, the GCD of the three numbers is also 1. This means that there is no common divisor greater than 1 for the three quantities of fruits.\n\nNow, we can use the Chinese remainder theorem to find the smallest x that satisfies the system of congruences. Since the GCD of the three numbers is 1, we can use the following formula:\n\nx = (328 * M1 * M1_inv + 473 * M2 * M2_inv + 615 * M3 * M3_inv) mod (328 * 473 * 615)\n\nwhere M1 = 473 * 615, M2 = 328 * 615, M3 = 328 * 473, and M1_inv, M2_inv, and M3_inv are the modular inverses of M1, M2, and M3 modulo 328, 473, and 615, respectively.\n\nCalculating the modular inverses:\n\nM1_inv ≡ 473 * 615 ^ -1 (mod 328) = 11\nM2_inv ≡ 328 * 615 ^ -1 (mod 473) = 413\nM3_inv ≡ 328 * 473 ^ -1 (mod 615) = 533\n\nNow, we can calculate x:\n\nx = (328 * 473 * 615 * 11 + 473 * 328 * 615 * 413 + 615 * 328 * 473 * 533) mod (328 * 473 * 615)\nx = 100776360\n\nSince x = 100776360, Ahmed needs to use 100776360 crates to arrange the fruits such that each crate contains the same number of each type of fruit."
