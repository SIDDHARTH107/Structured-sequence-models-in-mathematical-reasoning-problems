    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of a hailstorm occurring during the month of June is 0.25. What is the probability that in the next two years, at least one hailstorm will occur in the month of June?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability of NOT having a hailstorm in June for one year, and then find the probability of not having a hailstorm in June for two consecutive years. Finally, we will subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of having at least one hailstorm in June over the two years.\n\nProbability of not having a hailstorm in June for one year = 1 - Probability of having a hailstorm in June for one year = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\nProbability of not having a hailstorm in June for two consecutive years = (Probability of not having a hailstorm in June for one year)² = 0.75² = 0.5625\n\nProbability of having at least one hailstorm in June over the two years = 1 - Probability of not having a hailstorm in June for two consecutive years = 1 - 0.5625 = 0.4375\n\nSo, the probability of having at least one hailstorm in the month of June in the next two years is 0.4375 or 43.75%."
