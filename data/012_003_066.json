    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices are adjacent. A maximum independent set is an independent set of the largest possible size for a given graph.\n\nIn the given graph, one possible maximum independent set is {1, 3, 5, 8}. No two vertices in this set are adjacent, and there are no other independent sets with more vertices. Therefore, the size of the maximum independent set in the graph is 4."
