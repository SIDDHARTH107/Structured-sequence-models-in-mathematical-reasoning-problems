    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the function f(x) = 5cos(2x) + 2, we need to analyze the coefficients and the argument of the cosine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a cosine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the cosine term. In this case, the amplitude is |5| = 5.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a cosine function is determined by the coefficient inside the argument of the cosine function. The general formula for the period of a cosine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of the x term inside the cosine function. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 5cos(2x) + 2 is 5, and the period is π."
