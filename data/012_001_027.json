Create a set of unvisited vertices and initialize the distance of the starting vertex (A) to 0 and the distance of all other vertices to infinity.\n\n```\nUnvisited: {A, B, C, D, E}\nDistance: {A: 0, B: ∞, C: ∞, D: ∞, E: ∞}\n```\n\n2. Select the vertex with the smallest distance (A) and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n```\nUnvisited: {B, C, D, E}\nDistance: {A: 0, B: 5, C: 2, D: ∞, E: ∞}\n```\n\n3. Mark vertex A as visited and move to the next unvisited vertex with the smallest distance (C).\n\n```\nUnvisited: {B, D, E}\nDistance: {A: 0, B: 5, C: 2, D: ∞, E: ∞}\n```\n\n4.
