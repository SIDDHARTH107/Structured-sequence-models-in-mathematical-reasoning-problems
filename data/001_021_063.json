    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the polynomial equation 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 11x - 6 = 0, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (-6) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (2).\n\nFactors of -6: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±1/2, ±3/2\n\nNow, we can test these possible rational roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\n1. 2(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 - 11(1) - 6 ≠ 0\n2. 2(2)^3 + 3(2)^2 - 11(2) - 6 ≠ 0\n3. 2(3)^3 + 3(3)^2 - 11(3) - 6 ≠ 0\n4. 2(6)^3 + 3(6)^2 - 11(6) - 6 ≠ 0\n5. 2(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - 11(-1) - 6 ≠ 0\n6. 2(-2)^3 + 3(-2)^2 - 11(-2) - 6 ≠ 0\n7. 2(-3)^3 + 3(-3)^2 - 11(-3) - 6 ≠ 0\n8. 2(-6)^3 + 3(-6)^2 - 11(-6) - 6 ≠ 0\n9. 2(1/2)^3 + 3(1/2)^2 - 11(1/2) - 6 = 0 (This is a root: x = 1/2)\n10. 2(-1/2)^3 + 3(-1/2)^2 - 11(-1/2) - 6 ≠ 0\n11. 2(3/2)^3 + 3(3/2)^2 - 11(3/2) - 6 ≠ 0\n12. 2(-3/2)^3 + 3(-3/2)^2 - 11(-3/2) - 6 ≠ 0\n\nWe found one rational root: x = 1/2. Now, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n1/2 |  2   3  -11  -6\n         1   2    6\n      ---------------\n       2   4   -9   0\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is 2x^2 + 4x - 9. To find the remaining roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(2)(-9))) / (2(2))\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 72)) / 4\nx = (-4 ± √88) / 4\n\nThe remaining roots are x = (-4 + √88) / 4 and x = (-4 - √88) / 4.\n\nSo, the solutions of the polynomial equation 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 11x - 6 = 0 are x = 1/2, x = (-4 + √88) / 4, and x = (-4 - √88) / 4."
