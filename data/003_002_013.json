    "message_2": "Let's call the angle θ. We are given that the tangent of θ is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\). We can use a right triangle to find the sine and cosine of θ.\n\nLet's consider a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4, and a hypotenuse of length 5 (since 3² + 4² = 5²). The angle θ is opposite to the side of length 4 and adjacent to the side of length 3.\n\nNow we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent of θ:\n\n1. Sine (sin):\nsin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse = 4 / 5\n\n2. Cosine (cos):\ncos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 3 / 5\n\n3. Tangent (tan):\ntan(θ) = opposite / adjacent = 4 / 3 (given)\n\nSo, sin(θ) = 4/5, cos(θ) = 3/5, and tan(θ) = 4/3."
