    "message_1": "In a factory, there are 80 workers who operate heavy machinery. On average, 5% of them suffer an accident in a given year. What is the probability that at least 4 workers will suffer an accident in the upcoming year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (accidents) in n trials (workers), C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success (accident) on a single trial (worker), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (no accident) on a single trial.\n\nIn this case, n = 80 workers, p = 0.05 (5% chance of an accident), and we want to find the probability of at least 4 accidents, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for x = 4, 5, 6, ..., 80.\n\nHowever, it's easier to find the probability of the complementary event (0, 1, 2, or 3 accidents) and subtract it from 1. So, we'll calculate the probabilities for x = 0, 1, 2, and 3, and then subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1.\n\nP(0) = C(80, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(80-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.95^80 ≈ 0.000002\nP(1) = C(80, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(80-1) ≈ 0.000104\nP(2) = C(80, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(80-2) ≈ 0.002176\nP(3) = C(80, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(80-3) ≈ 0.021603\n\nNow, we'll sum these probabilities and subtract the result from 1:\n\n1 - (0.000002 + 0.000104 + 0.002176 + 0.021603) ≈ 1 - 0.023885 ≈ 0.976115\n\nSo, the probability that at least 4 workers will suffer an accident in the upcoming year is approximately 0.976 or 97.61%."
