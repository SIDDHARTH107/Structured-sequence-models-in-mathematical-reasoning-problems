    "message_2": "We will use the Sylow theorems to solve this problem.\n\nSince the order of G is 7^2, by the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 7-subgroups of G, denoted by n_7, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2. n_7 divides 7^2\n\nThe only possibilities for n_7 are 1 and 7^1 = 7. \n\nCase 1: n_7 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup, which we denote by P. By the Sylow theorems, P is normal in G. Since the order of P is 7 (a prime), P is cyclic, and thus isomorphic to Z_7. Since the order of G is 7^2 and P is normal in G, we have that G is a semidirect product of P with itself. However, since P is abelian, the semidirect product is just the direct product, and G is isomorphic to Z_7 × Z_7.\n\nCase 2: n_7 = 7\nIn this case, there are 7 Sylow 7-subgroups. Let P and Q be two distinct Sylow 7-subgroups. Since the order of P and Q is 7 (a prime), both P and Q are cyclic, and thus isomorphic to Z_7. The intersection of P and Q is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. The order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 7 * 7 / 1 = 7^2. Since the order of PQ is equal to the order of G, we have that G = PQ.\n\nNow, we claim that G is the internal direct product of P and Q. To show this, we need to prove that P ∩ Q = {e} and that for any g ∈ G, there exists unique p ∈ P and q ∈ Q such that g = pq.\n\nWe have already shown that P ∩ Q = {e}. Now, let g ∈ G. Since G = PQ, there exist p₁ ∈ P and q₁ ∈ Q such that g = p₁q₁. Suppose there also exist p₂ ∈ P and q₂ ∈ Q such that g = p₂q₂. Then, p₁q₁ = p₂q₂, and thus p₁^(-1)p₂ = q₂q₁^(-1). Since p₁^(-1)p₂ ∈ P and q₂q₁^(-1) ∈ Q, and P ∩ Q = {e}, we have that p₁^(-1)p₂ = q₂q₁^(-1) = e. Therefore, p₁ = p₂ and q₁ = q₂, which means the representation of g as the product of elements from P and Q is unique.\n\nThus, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to Z_7 × Z_7.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is cyclic (isomorphic to Z_(7^2)) or G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7 (Z_7 × Z_7)."
