    "message_2": "To determine the value of i_X when n=3, we will use the following formula for Fano varieties:\n\nK_X = -(i_X)H,\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical divisor, H is an ample divisor, and i_X is the index of the Fano variety X.\n\nSince the Picard number ρ(X) = n+2, we have ρ(X) = 3+2 = 5 when n=3.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection form on the Néron-Severi group NS(X) of X. The intersection form is a non-degenerate, symmetric bilinear form on NS(X), and it is known that the signature of this form is (1, ρ(X)-1). In our case, the signature is (1, 4).\n\nBy the Hodge Index Theorem, the intersection form has exactly one positive eigenvalue and ρ(X)-1 negative eigenvalues. Since the intersection form is positive definite on the ample cone, we know that H^2 > 0. Moreover, by the definition of the index i_X, we have K_X = -(i_X)H, so (K_X, H) = -(i_X)H^2.\n\nNow, we use the fact that X is a Fano variety of dimension 3. This implies that K_X^3 < 0, since the canonical divisor is anti-ample. By expanding this expression, we get:\n\n(K_X, K_X, K_X) = -(i_X)^3(H, H, H) < 0.\n\nSince H^2 > 0 and (H, H, H) > 0, it follows that -(i_X)^3 < 0, which implies that i_X must be an odd integer. The possible values for i_X are then 1, 3, 5, ....\n\nNow, we use the fact that ρ(X) = 5. By the Riemann-Roch theorem for threefolds, we have:\n\nχ(X, mK_X) = (1/6)(mK_X, mK_X, mK_X) + (1/12)(mK_X, mK_X) + χ(X, O_X),\n\nwhere χ(X, mK_X) is the holomorphic Euler characteristic of the line bundle mK_X, and χ(X, O_X) is a topological invariant of X.\n\nSince X is a Fano variety, we know that χ(X, O_X) = 1. Moreover, we have:\n\n(mK_X, mK_X, mK_X) = m^3(K_X, K_X, K_X) = -(i_X)^3m^3(H, H, H),\n\nand\n\n(mK_X, mK_X) = m^2(K_X, K_X) = -(i_X)^2m^2(H, H).\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the Riemann-Roch formula, we get:\n\nχ(X, mK_X) = (1/6)(-(i_X)^3m^3(H, H, H)) + (1/12)(-(i_X)^2m^2(H, H)) + 1.\n\nNow, we consider the case m = 1. Then, we have:\n\nχ(X, K_X) = (1/6)(-(i_X)^3(H, H, H)) + (1/12)(-(i_X)^2(H, H)) + 1.\n\nSince χ(X, K_X) is an integer, it follows that (H, H, H) must be divisible by 6 and (H, H) must be divisible by 12. In particular, this implies that (H, H, H) is an even integer.\n\nNow, we claim that i_X = 1. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that i_X > 1. Then, we have:\n\n(K_X, K_X, K_X) = -(i_X)^3(H, H, H) < 0,\n\nwhich implies that (H, H, H) is an odd integer. This contradicts the fact that (H, H, H) is even, and so we must have i_X = 1.\n\nTherefore, the index i_X of the Fano variety X with dimension n=3 and Picard number ρ(X) = n+2 is i_X = 1."
