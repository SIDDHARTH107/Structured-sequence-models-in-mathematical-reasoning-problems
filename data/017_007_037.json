    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will use the fact that a group of order 6 must have an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, due to Lagrange's theorem.\n\nLet a be an element of order 2 in G, and let b be an element of order 3 in G. Then, the subgroup generated by a has order 2, and the subgroup generated by b has order 3. Since the orders of these subgroups are coprime, their intersection must be the identity element, i.e., ⟨a⟩ ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e}.\n\nNow, consider the set {ab}. Since a and b have different orders, ab ≠ a and ab ≠ b. Also, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = e, since a and b commute. Therefore, ab is an element of order 2 in G. Since G has only one element of order 2, we must have ab = a. Thus, a and b commute, and we have the relation ab = ba.\n\nNow, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is generated by a single element, say g. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 6, and we can write G = ⟨g⟩. Then, g^6 = e, and we can take a = g^3 and b = g^2. Thus, G is isomorphic to C6, with generator g and relation g^6 = e.\n\nCase 2: G is not generated by a single element. In this case, G must be generated by both a and b. Since a and b commute, we can write G = ⟨a, b⟩, with relations a^2 = b^3 = e and ab = ba. This is precisely the presentation of the dihedral group D3, so G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn summary, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 with generator g and relation g^6 = e, or the dihedral group D3 with generators a and b, and relations a^2 = b^3 = e and ab = ba."
