    "message_1": "A digital signature algorithm applies a mathematical function to a message to produce a signature. In the RSA signature scheme, suppose the private key is (d,n) = (67,187) and the hash of the message is 55. Calculate the digital signature of the message using the RSA signature scheme.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the digital signature using the RSA signature scheme, we need to raise the hash of the message to the power of the private key exponent (d) and then take the modulus with respect to n. In this case, the private key is (d, n) = (67, 187) and the hash of the message is 55.\n\nDigital signature = (hash of the message)^d mod n\nDigital signature = (55)^67 mod 187\n\nNow, we need to compute 55^67 mod 187. You can use a calculator or a programming language to compute this value.\n\nDigital signature = 96\n\nSo, the digital signature of the message using the RSA signature scheme is 96."
