Bob chose k=3 as his secret key and encrypted the message M=4. He sent the ciphertext (a,b) to Alice, where a = g^k mod p and b = M * y^k mod p. Find the plaintext message that Alice received.",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the ciphertext (a,b) that Bob sent to Alice.\n\na = g^k mod p = 2^3 mod 11 = 8\nb = M * y^k mod p = 4 * 7^3 mod 11 = 4 * 343 mod 11 = 1372 mod 11 = 10\n\nSo, the ciphertext (a,b) = (8, 10).\n\nNow, let's decrypt the ciphertext to find the plaintext message that Alice received. To do this, we need to find Alice's secret key x such that y = g^x mod p. Since we know y = 7, g = 2, and p = 11:\n\n7 = 2^x mod 11\n\nBy trying different values of x, we find that x = 3 satisfies the equation:\n\n7 = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 7\n\nNow, Alice can compute the inverse of a^x mod p:\n\na^x mod p = 8^3 mod 11 = 512 mod 11 = 6\n\nThe inverse of 6 mod 11 is 2, since 6 * 2 mod 11 = 12 mod 11 = 1.\n\nFinally, Alice can compute the plaintext message M:\n\nM = b * (a^x)^(-1) mod p = 10 * 2 mod 11 = 20 mod 11 = 9\n\nSo, the plaintext message that Alice received is M = 9."
