    "message_2": "To find the group of all complex points, $E(\\mathbb{C})$, of the elliptic curve $E$, we will first find the torsion points (points of finite order) and then describe the structure of the free part of the group.\n\n1. Torsion Points:\n\nWe will use Nagell-Lutz theorem to find the torsion points. According to the theorem, if $(x, y)$ is a torsion point with integer coordinates, then either $y = 0$ or $y^2$ divides the discriminant of the curve.\n\nThe discriminant of the given curve, $\\Delta = -16(4(-2)^3 - 27(2)^2) = -16(32 - 108) = 1216$. The divisors of $\\Delta$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm 19, \\pm 38, \\pm 76, \\pm 152, \\pm 304, \\pm 608, \\pm 1216$.\n\nNow, we will check for each divisor $d$ of $\\Delta$ if there exists an integer $x$ such that $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2$ has an integer solution.\n\n- For $d = \\pm 1$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 2$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 4$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 8$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 19$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 38$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 76$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 152$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 304$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 608$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n- For $d = \\pm 1216$, there is no integer solution for $x$.\n\nThus, there are no torsion points with integer coordinates. However, we need to consider torsion points with complex coordinates as well. Since the curve is defined over the field of complex numbers, we can use the fact that the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{C}$ is isomorphic to either $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$, where $n$ and $m$ are coprime integers.\n\nIn this case, since we have no torsion points with integer coordinates, the torsion subgroup is trivial, i.e., isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/1\\mathbb{Z}$, which means it contains only the point at infinity, denoted as $O$.\n\n2. Free Part:\n\nThe free part of the group $E(\\mathbb{C})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^r$, where $r$ is the rank of the curve. The rank of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{C}$ is not easy to compute in general. However, for this specific curve, we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem, which states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated. Since we have no torsion points, the rank must be at least 1.\n\nThus, the structure of the group $E(\\mathbb{C})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}^r$, where $r \\geq 1$. To find the actual rank and generators of the free part, one would need to use more advanced techniques like the method of elliptic logarithms or the method of descent."
