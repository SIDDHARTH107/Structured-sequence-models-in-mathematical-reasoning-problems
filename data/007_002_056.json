    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer greater than 1000 that is divisible by 7, 11, and 13, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers and then find the smallest multiple of that LCM that is greater than 1000.\n\nThe prime factorization of each number is:\n7 = 7^1\n11 = 11^1\n13 = 13^1\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors: LCM(7, 11, 13) = 7^1 * 11^1 * 13^1 = 1001.\n\nSince 1001 is already greater than 1000, the smallest positive integer greater than 1000 that is divisible by 7, 11, and 13 is 1001."
