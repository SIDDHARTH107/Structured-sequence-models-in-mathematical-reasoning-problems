    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, then subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(3)(2x + y - 3z) = (3)(7) => 6x + 3y - 9z = 21\n(2)(3x - 2y + 5z) = (2)(-4) => 6x - 4y + 10z = -8\n\nNow subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(6x - 4y + 10z) - (6x + 3y - 9z) = -8 - 21\n-7y + 19z = -29\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -1 and the third equation by 2, then add the first equation to the third equation:\n\n(-1)(2x + y - 3z) = (-1)(7) => -2x - y + 3z = -7\n(2)(x + 4y + z) = (2)(6) => 2x + 8y + 2z = 12\n\nNow add the first equation to the second equation:\n\n(-2x - y + 3z) + (2x + 8y + 2z) = -7 + 12\n7y + 5z = 5\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations in two variables:\n\n-7y + 19z = -29\n7y + 5z = 5\n\nAdd the two equations together to eliminate y:\n\n(-7y + 19z) + (7y + 5z) = -29 + 5\n24z = -24\n\nNow solve for z:\n\nz = -24 / 24\nz = -1\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with y:\n\n7y + 5z = 5\n7y + 5(-1) = 5\n7y - 5 = 5\n7y = 10\ny = 10 / 7\n\nNow that we have y, we can substitute y and z back into one of the equations with x:\n\n2x + y - 3z = 7\n2x + (10 / 7) - 3(-1) = 7\n2x + 10 / 7 + 3 = 7\n2x = 7 - 10 / 7 - 3\n2x = (49 - 10 - 21) / 7\n2x = 18 / 7\nx = 9 / 7\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 9 / 7\ny = 10 / 7\nz = -1"
