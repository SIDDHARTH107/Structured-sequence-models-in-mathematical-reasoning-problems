    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs which have a 5% chance of being defective. If a box contains 20 light bulbs, what is the probability that at least one light bulb in the box will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one light bulb in the box is defective, we can first find the probability that none of the light bulbs are defective and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single light bulb is not defective is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 20 light bulbs in the box, the probability that all of them are not defective is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one light bulb is defective, we subtract the probability that none are defective from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one light bulb in the box is defective is approximately 64.15%."
