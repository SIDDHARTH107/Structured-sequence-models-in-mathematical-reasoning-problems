    "message_2": "First, we can rewrite the equation using the property of exponents that states a^(mn) = (a^m)^n. Also, note that 27 can be written as 3^3. So, the equation becomes:\n\n3^(2x+1) = (3^3)^(x-1)\n\nNow, we can use the property of exponents that states (a^m)^n = a^(mn):\n\n3^(2x+1) = 3^(3(x-1))\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2x+1 = 3(x-1)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x + 1 = 3x - 3\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n2x + 4 = 3x\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides:\n\n4 = x\n\nSo, x = 4."
