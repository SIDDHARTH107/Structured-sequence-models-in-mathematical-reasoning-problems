    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 7, where 7 is a prime number. We want to show that G is cyclic.\n\nSince the order of G is 7, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element g in G must divide 7. The possible orders for elements in G are 1 and 7, as 7 is a prime number.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G such that g is not the identity element (e). Since g â‰  e, the order of g cannot be 1. Therefore, the order of g must be 7.\n\nRecall that the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e. Since the order of g is 7, we have g^7 = e. This means that the set {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6} contains 7 distinct elements, as none of the powers of g are equal to each other except for g^7 = e.\n\nSince G has 7 elements and the set {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6} also has 7 distinct elements, we can conclude that G = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6}. This shows that G is generated by the single element g, and therefore, G is a cyclic group.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of prime order (in this case, order 7) is cyclic."
