    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, I will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations. To do this, we can add the first and second equations:\n\n(2x + y - z) + (x + 2y + z) = 3 + 1\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x + 3y = 4\n\nNow, let's divide the equation by 3:\n\nx + y = 4/3\n\nNext, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations. To do this, we can subtract the second equation from the third equation multiplied by 4:\n\n(3x + 2y + 4z) - 4(x + 2y + z) = 5 - 4\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-1x - 4z = 1\n\nNow, let's multiply the equation by -1:\n\nx + 4z = -1\n\nNow we have two new equations:\n\n1. x + y = 4/3\n2. x + 4z = -1\n\nLet's eliminate x from these two equations. To do this, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(x + 4z) - (x + y) = -1 - 4/3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n- y + 4z = -1/3\n\nNow, let's multiply the equation by -1:\n\ny - 4z = 1/3\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\n1. x + y = 4/3\n2. y - 4z = 1/3\n\nLet's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 4/3 - y\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\ny - 4z = 1/3\n\n(4/3 - y) - 4z = 1/3\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\n-3y = -1\n\ny = 1/3\n\nNow that we have the value of y, let's substitute it back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 4/3 - (1/3)\n\nx = 3/3\n\nx = 1\n\nFinally, let's substitute the values of x and y into the equation for z:\n\nx + 4z = -1\n\n1 + 4z = -1\n\n4z = -2\n\nz = -1/2\n\nSo the complete solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1, y = 1/3, z = -1/2"
