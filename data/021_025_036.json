    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is an iterative process that involves searching for the best solution in the given search space. Here, we will use the WOA to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 9x - 5 within the range of x from -5 to 5.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Number of whales (population size): N = 30\n- Maximum number of iterations: T = 100\n- Define the search space: Lower bound (LB) = -5, Upper bound (UB) = 5\n\nStep 2: Initialize the positions of the whales randomly within the search space\n- Generate N random positions for the whales within the range of LB and UB\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the fitness of each whale\n- Calculate the value of f(x) for each whale's position and store it as their fitness\n\nStep 4: Find the best whale (the one with the minimum fitness value)\n- Store the best whale's position as X_star\n\nStep 5: Start the iterative process\n- For each iteration t (from 1 to T):\n  - Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations\n  - Ensure the new positions are within the search space (LB and UB)\n  - Evaluate the fitness of each whale at their new positions\n  - Update X_star if a better solution (lower fitness value) is found\n\nStep 6: Return the best solution (X_star) and its corresponding minimum value of f(x)\n\nNote: The Whale Optimization Algorithm involves several mathematical equations and random number generations, which are difficult to demonstrate in plain text. To implement the WOA, you would need to use a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or R.\n\nAfter running the Whale Optimization Algorithm with the given function and search space, you will obtain the minimum value of the function and the corresponding value of x."
