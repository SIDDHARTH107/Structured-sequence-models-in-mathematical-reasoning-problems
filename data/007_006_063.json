    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 42 and 56 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (56) by the smaller number (42) and find the remainder.\n   56 รท 42 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 14.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (56) with the smaller number (42) and the smaller number with the remainder (14) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 42 and 14.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (42) by the new smaller number (14) and find the remainder.\n   42 รท 14 = 3 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 14.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 42 and 56 is 14."
