    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 5, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x - 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first factor out the greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\n3(x^2 - 2x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can focus on the quadratic inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 3 = 0\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation as follows:\n\n(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\nx + 1 = 0 => x = -1\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 5 are x = -1 and x = 3."
