    "message_2": "To find the general solution to the given partial differential equation, we can first try to find the characteristic curves by solving the associated ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The given PDE is of the form:\n\n$$a\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + 2b\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x\\partial y} + c\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = 0$$\n\nwith $a = 1$, $b = \\frac{3}{2}$, and $c = -2$. The characteristic ODEs are given by:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - ac}}{a}$$\n\nPlugging in the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\frac{3}{2})^2 - (1)(-2)}}{1}$$\n\nSolving for the two possible values of $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dy}{dx} = -2$$\n\nNow we can solve these two ODEs separately:\n\n1. $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 1$:\n\nIntegrating, we get $y = x + C_1$, where $C_1$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n2. $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -2$:\n\nIntegrating, we get $y = -2x + C_2$, where $C_2$ is another arbitrary constant.\n\nNow we can express the general solution of the PDE in terms of these characteristic curves. Let $u(x, y) = F(x + y)$ for some function $F$. Then, along the curve $y = x + C_1$, we have:\n\n$$u(x, y) = F(2x + C_1)$$\n\nSimilarly, let $u(x, y) = G(-2x + y)$ for some function $G$. Then, along the curve $y = -2x + C_2$, we have:\n\n$$u(x, y) = G(C_2)$$\n\nThus, the general solution of the given PDE can be written as:\n\n$$u(x, y) = F(2x + y) + G(-2x + y)$$\n\nwhere $F$ and $G$ are arbitrary complex-valued functions."
