    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, we know that the prime factorization of the order of G is 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 divides 27, and\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which must be normal. Let P be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_9) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 (isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3).\n\nIf P is cyclic, then G has a normal subgroup of order 9, and by Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 3. Let x be an element of order 3 in G. Then the cyclic subgroup generated by x, denoted by <x>, has order 3. Since the orders of P and <x> are relatively prime, by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and <x>, which is a cyclic group of order 27. Thus, G is cyclic in this case.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3, then G is a semidirect product of P and <x>. Since the order of the automorphism group of P is 6, there is a unique nontrivial homomorphism from <x> to the automorphism group of P. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and <x>, which is a group of order 27 that is not cyclic.\n\nIn summary, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9. If G is cyclic, it has a unique subgroup of each order dividing 27, namely, 1, 3, 9, and 27. If G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, then it has subgroups of order 1, 3, 9, and 27, but not a unique subgroup of order 9. In this case, the group structure can be described as the set of elements {(a, b) | a in Z_3, b in Z_9} with the group operation (a, b) * (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)."
