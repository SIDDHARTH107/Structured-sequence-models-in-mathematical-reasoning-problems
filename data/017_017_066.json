    "message_2": "Let's denote the element of order 15 in G as x, so x^15 = e (where e is the identity element of G). Since G has order 30, by Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element of order 2 and an element of order 3 in G. Let's denote these elements as y and z, respectively, so y^2 = e and z^3 = e.\n\nNow, consider the element yx. We will show that the order of yx is 6. Note that (yx)^6 = y^6x^6 = (y^2)^3(x^3)^2 = e, since y and x commute. To show that the order of yx is indeed 6, we need to show that (yx)^k ≠ e for 1 ≤ k < 6. Suppose, for contradiction, that (yx)^k = e for some k in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Then y^kx^k = e, which implies x^k = y^(-k). Since the order of y is 2, we have y^(-k) = y^k. Thus, x^k = y^k, which means that x^k and y^k commute. However, x and y do not commute, as G is non-abelian. This is a contradiction, so the order of yx must be 6.\n\nNow, we will show that G is generated by x and yx. Let g be an arbitrary element in G. Since G has order 30, the order of g must divide 30. Thus, the possible orders of g are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. If the order of g is 1, then g = e, and we can write g = x^0(yx)^0. If the order of g is 2, then g = y, and we can write g = x^0(yx)^1. If the order of g is 3, then g = z, and we can write g = x^5(yx)^2. If the order of g is 5, then g = x^3, and we can write g = x^3(yx)^0. If the order of g is 6, then g = yx, and we can write g = x^0(yx)^1. If the order of g is 10, then g = x^3z, and we can write g = x^3(yx)^2. If the order of g is 15, then g = x, and we can write g = x^1(yx)^0. If the order of g is 30, then g = xz, and we can write g = x^1(yx)^2.\n\nIn all cases, we can write g as a product of powers of x and yx. Thus, G is generated by x and yx.\n\nNow, let's define a map φ: G → Z_15 × Z_6 by φ(g) = (a, b), where g = x^a(yx)^b. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since G is generated by x and yx, every element g in G can be uniquely written as g = x^a(yx)^b, where 0 ≤ a < 15 and 0 ≤ b < 6.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let g1 = x^a1(yx)^b1 and g2 = x^a2(yx)^b2. Then φ(g1g2) = φ(x^(a1+a2)(yx)^(b1+b2)) = ((a1 + a2) mod 15, (b1 + b2) mod 6) = (a1 mod 15 + a2 mod 15, b1 mod 6 + b2 mod 6) = φ(g1) + φ(g2).\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(g1) = φ(g2) for some g1, g2 in G. Then (a1, b1) = (a2, b2), which implies a1 = a2 and b1 = b2. Thus, g1 = x^a1(yx)^b1 = x^a2(yx)^b2 = g2, so φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: For any (a, b) in Z_15 × Z_6, there exists an element g = x^a(yx)^b in G such that φ(g) = (a, b). Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism that is both injective and surjective, φ is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to Z_15 × Z_6, which is a non-abelian group of order 30."
