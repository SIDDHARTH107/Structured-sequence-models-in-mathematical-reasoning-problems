    "message_2": "The Laplace Transform is typically applied to functions of time, not complex numbers. The Laplace Transform is defined as:\n\nF(s) = L{f(t)} = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nHowever, the function you provided, f(z) = z^2 + z + 1, is a complex number function, not a time-domain function. Therefore, it is not appropriate to apply the Laplace Transform to this function.\n\nIf you meant to provide a time-domain function, please provide the correct function, and I will be happy to help you find its Laplace Transform."
