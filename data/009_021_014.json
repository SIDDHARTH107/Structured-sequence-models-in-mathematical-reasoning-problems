    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be expressed as a product of functions of x, y, and t. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Then, we can rewrite the partial differential equation as:\n\n(∂u/∂t) = 10(∂^2u/∂x^2 + ∂^2u/∂y^2) => X(x)Y(y)(dT/dt) = 10(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 10XYT:\n\n(dT/dt) / (10T) = (X''/X) + (Y''/Y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\n(dT/dt) / (10T) = -λ => dT/dt = -10λT\n\nNow, we have an ordinary differential equation for T(t):\n\ndT/dt = -10λT\n\nThe general solution for this equation is:\n\nT(t) = A * e^(-10λt)\n\nNow, let's consider the spatial part of the equation:\n\n(X''/X) + (Y''/Y) = -λ\n\nLet's separate the variables further:\n\nX''/X = -λ - Y''/Y = μ => X'' = μX, Y'' = -(μ + λ)Y\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations for X(x) and Y(y):\n\nX'' = μX\nY'' = -(μ + λ)Y\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\nX(x) = B * cos(√μx) + C * sin(√μx)\nY(y) = D * cosh(√(μ + λ)y) + E * sinh(√(μ + λ)y)\n\nNow, we have the product solution:\n\nu(x, y, t) = (B * cos(√μx) + C * sin(√μx)) * (D * cosh(√(μ + λ)y) + E * sinh(√(μ + λ)y)) * A * e^(-10λt)\n\nTo find the coefficients A, B, C, D, and E, and the constants μ and λ, we need to use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = x^2y:\n\nx^2y = (B * cos(√μx) + C * sin(√μx)) * (D * cosh(√(μ + λ)y) + E * sinh(√(μ + λ)y)) * A\n\nSince this equation must hold for all x and y, we need to find a suitable combination of coefficients and constants that satisfy the initial condition. However, this is a highly nontrivial task and requires advanced techniques from functional analysis and Fourier series.\n\nIn general, the solution u(x, y, t) will be a sum of product solutions, each with different coefficients and constants. The specific form of the solution will depend on the boundary conditions and the domain of the problem."
