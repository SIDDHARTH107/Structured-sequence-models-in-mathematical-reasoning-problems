The cost of production of each square centimetre of the steel plate is given by the function C(x, y) = 0.01(x + y) + 4, where x is the length and y is the width of the plate. The company wants to minimize their cost of production for a given area of steel plate. \n\nWhat are the dimensions of the steel plate that will minimize the cost of production for an area of 150 square centimetres?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the cost function for the entire steel plate. Since the cost function C(x, y) is given for each square centimeter, we need to multiply it by the area of the steel plate (x * y) to get the total cost:\n\nTotal cost function: T(x, y) = C(x, y) * x * y = (0.01(x + y) + 4) * x * y\n\nWe are given that the area of the steel plate is 150 square centimeters. So, x * y = 150. We can rewrite y in terms of x as y = 150/x.\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for y into the total cost function:\n\nT(x, 150/x) = (0.01(x + 150/x) + 4) * x * (150/x)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find the critical points of this function by taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it to 0:\n\ndT/dx = 0\n\nWe can use the quotient rule to find the derivative:\n\ndT/dx = (150 * (0.01(x + 150/x) + 4) - x * (0.01 + 0.01(150/x^2))) / x^2\n\nNow, set the derivative to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = (150 * (0.01(x + 150/x) + 4) - x * (0.01 + 0.01(150/x^2))) / x^2\n\n0 = 150 * (0.01(x + 150/x) + 4) - x * (0.01 + 0.01(150/x^2))\n\nNow, we can solve for x using numerical methods or graphing. After solving, we get x ≈ 8.66 cm. Now, we can find y using the expression we found earlier:\n\ny = 150/x ≈ 150/8.66 ≈ 17.32 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the steel plate that will minimize the cost of production for an area of 150 square centimeters are approximately 8.66 cm by 17.32 cm."
