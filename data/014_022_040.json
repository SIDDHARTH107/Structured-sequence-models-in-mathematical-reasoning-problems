    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we first need to create the Playfair cipher table using the key \"MATHS\". The table will be a 5x5 grid containing the letters of the alphabet (excluding 'J').\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet in order (excluding 'J'): MATHSBCDEFGIKLNOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nNow, create the 5x5 grid:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNext, we need the encrypted message. However, the problem statement only provides the plaintext \"HELLO WORLD\". To decrypt the message, we need the encrypted message, not the plaintext. Please provide the encrypted message to proceed with decryption."
