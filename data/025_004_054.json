    "message_2": "A rational curve of genus $0$ in projective space is isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$. To find the degree of such a curve passing through $8$ general points in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, we can use the following approach.\n\nConsider a linear system of curves of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The dimension of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ in $4$ variables is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n$$\\binom{d+3}{3} = \\frac{(d+3)(d+2)(d+1)}{6}.$$\n\nA curve of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ has $d(d+3)$ conditions to pass through a point. Since we want the curve to pass through $8$ general points, we need to satisfy $8$ conditions:\n\n$$d(d+3) = 8.$$\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for $d$, we get $d^2 + 3d - 8 = 0$. Factoring, we have $(d-2)(d+4) = 0$. Since the degree cannot be negative, we take the positive solution $d = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of a rational curve of genus $0$ passing through $8$ general points in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is $2$."
