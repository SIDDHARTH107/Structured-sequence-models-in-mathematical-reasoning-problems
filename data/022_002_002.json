    "message_2": "(a) Let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then, the given circle can be represented as:\n\n|z - 2 - i| = |(x - 2) + (y - 1)i| = 2\n\nNow, let's find the image of this circle under the function f(z):\n\nf(z) = 4z + 3i = 4(x + yi) + 3i = (4x) + (4y + 3)i\n\nLet w = u + vi be the image of z under f(z), where u and v are real numbers. Then, we have:\n\nu = 4x\nv = 4y + 3\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation of the circle in terms of u and v:\n\n|((u/4) - 2) + ((v - 3)/4 - 1)i| = 2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n|((u - 8)/4) + ((v - 7)/4)i| = 2\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n|(u - 8) + (v - 7)i| = 8\n\nThus, the image of the circle under f(z) is another circle with the equation:\n\n|w - 8 - 7i| = 8\n\n(b) Let's find a conformal mapping that maps the region {z: |z| < 1} onto the region {w: |w - i| < 1}. \n\nConsider the Möbius transformation:\n\ng(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex constants. We want to find the values of a, b, c, and d such that g(z) maps the unit circle |z| < 1 onto the circle |w - i| < 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the image of z = 1 under g(z):\n\ng(1) = (a + b) / (c + d)\n\nSince g(1) is on the circle |w - i| < 1, we have:\n\n|g(1) - i| = 1\n\nNow, let's find the image of z = -1 under g(z):\n\ng(-1) = (-a + b) / (-c + d)\n\nSince g(-1) is also on the circle |w - i| < 1, we have:\n\n|g(-1) - i| = 1\n\nNow, let's find the image of z = i under g(z):\n\ng(i) = (ai + b) / (ci + d)\n\nSince g(i) is on the circle |w - i| < 1, we have:\n\n|g(i) - i| = 1\n\nNow, we have three equations with four unknowns (a, b, c, and d). To simplify the problem, let's set d = 1 (since Möbius transformations are determined up to a constant factor, we can do this without loss of generality). Then, we have:\n\ng(z) = (az + b) / (cz + 1)\n\nNow, we have three equations with three unknowns:\n\n|((a + b) / (c + 1)) - i| = 1\n|((-a + b) / (-c + 1)) - i| = 1\n|((ai + b) / (ci + 1)) - i| = 1\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that a = 1, b = i, and c = 1. Thus, the conformal mapping g(z) is:\n\ng(z) = (z + i) / (z + 1)\n\nThis mapping maps the region {z: |z| < 1} onto the region {w: |w - i| < 1}."
