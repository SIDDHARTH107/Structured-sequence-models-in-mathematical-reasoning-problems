    "message_2": "To solve for x, where sin(x) - cos(x) = 0, we can rewrite the equation as sin(x) = cos(x).\n\nWe know that sin(x) = cos(90° - x) or sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x) in radians.\n\nSo, x = 90° - x or x = π/2 - x in radians.\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x = 90° or 2x = π/2\n\nx = 45° or x = π/4\n\nTherefore, the solution for x is x = 45° or x = π/4 in radians. However, since sine and cosine functions are periodic, we need to consider their periods to find all possible solutions.\n\nFor sine, the period is 360° or 2π, and for cosine, the period is also 360° or 2π.\n\nSo, the general solution for x is:\n\nx = 45° + 360°n or x = π/4 + 2πn\n\nwhere n is an integer."
