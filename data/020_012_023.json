    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to minimize the cost of producing a metal cylinder with a fixed volume of 50 cubic meters. The company can choose the radius and height of the cylinder but has to use a minimum of 10 square meters of sheet metal. If the cost of metal sheet is 5 dollars per square meter and the cost of labor is 10 dollars per hour, determine the dimensions of the cylinder that will minimize the cost of production.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of producing the metal cylinder, we need to minimize the surface area of the cylinder while maintaining a fixed volume of 50 cubic meters and using at least 10 square meters of sheet metal.\n\nThe volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. We are given that V = 50 cubic meters. So,\n\n50 = πr²h\n\nThe surface area A of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nA = 2πrh + 2πr²\n\nWe need to minimize A while maintaining the given volume. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We will introduce a new variable λ (the Lagrange multiplier) and form the following equation:\n\nF(r, h, λ) = 2πrh + 2πr² - λ(πr²h - 50)\n\nNow we need to find the partial derivatives of F with respect to r, h, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂F/∂r = 2πh + 4πr - 2λπrh = 0\n∂F/∂h = 2πr - λπr² = 0\n∂F/∂λ = πr²h - 50 = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express λ in terms of r:\n\nλ = 2πr / (πr²) = 2 / r\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for λ back into the first equation:\n\n2πh + 4πr - 2(2 / r)πrh = 0\n\nSimplifying and solving for h in terms of r:\n\nh = (4r² - 4) / (2r) = 2r - 2/r\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for h back into the volume constraint equation (πr²h = 50):\n\nπr²(2r - 2/r) = 50\n\nSolving for r:\n\n2πr³ - 2π = 50\n\n2πr³ = 52\n\nr³ = 52 / (2π)\n\nr = (52 / (2π))^(1/3) ≈ 1.216 m\n\nNow we can find the height h:\n\nh = 2r - 2/r ≈ 2(1.216) - 2/1.216 ≈ 1.936 m\n\nSo, the dimensions of the cylinder that will minimize the cost of production are approximately:\n\nRadius: 1.216 meters\nHeight: 1.936 meters"
