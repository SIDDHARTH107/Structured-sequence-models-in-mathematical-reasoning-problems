    "message_1": "Consider the Calabi-Yau variety defined as the solution set to the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3+w^3=0$ in four-dimensional complex space. Find a non-zero complex number $a$ such that the equation $ax^3+ay^3+az^3+aw^3=0$ also defines a Calabi-Yau variety in four-dimensional complex space.",
    "message_2": "To find a non-zero complex number $a$ such that the equation $ax^3 + ay^3 + az^3 + aw^3 = 0$ also defines a Calabi-Yau variety in four-dimensional complex space, we need to ensure that the new equation has the same properties as the original Calabi-Yau variety.\n\nA Calabi-Yau variety has a trivial canonical bundle, which means that the top exterior power of the cotangent bundle is trivial. In other words, the canonical class of the variety is trivial. For a hypersurface in complex projective space, this condition is equivalent to the degree of the hypersurface being equal to the dimension of the ambient space plus one.\n\nIn our case, the original equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0$ defines a Calabi-Yau variety in four-dimensional complex space, so the degree of the hypersurface is 3, which is equal to the dimension of the ambient space (4) minus 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation $ax^3 + ay^3 + az^3 + aw^3 = 0$. Since the coefficients of the monomials are all equal to $a$, we can factor out $a$ from the equation:\n\n$$a(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can see that the new equation is just a scalar multiple of the original equation. Since the degree of the hypersurface is unchanged (still 3), and the dimension of the ambient space is still 4, the new equation also defines a Calabi-Yau variety in four-dimensional complex space.\n\nTherefore, any non-zero complex number $a$ will satisfy the condition, as the new equation will still define a Calabi-Yau variety in four-dimensional complex space."
