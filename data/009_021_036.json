    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation: \n\nu_t = 8u_xx\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature distribution in a metal bar.\n\nSuppose the initial temperature distribution in the bar is given by:\n\nu(x,0) = x(1-x), 0 < x < 1\n\nFind the temperature distribution in the bar for t > 0 if the two ends of the bar are kept at a fixed temperature of 0.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 8X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = 8X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = 8X''(x)/X(x) = -λ^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) T'(t) = -λ^2T(t)\n2) X''(x) = -λ^2/8X(x)\n\nSolve the second equation first:\n\nX''(x) + (λ^2/8)X(x) = 0\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0 (since the ends of the bar are kept at a fixed temperature of 0).\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 0\nX(1) = B*sin(λ) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be 0 (trivial solution), we have sin(λ) = 0, which implies λ = nπ for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThus, the eigenfunctions are:\n\nX_n(x) = sin(nπx)\n\nNow, solve the first equation:\n\nT'(t) + λ^2T(t) = 0\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n*exp(-n^2π^2t)\n\nThe overall solution is a linear combination of the product of the eigenfunctions and their corresponding time functions:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[C_n*sin(nπx)*exp(-n^2π^2t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = x(1-x):\n\nx(1-x) = Σ[C_n*sin(nπx)]\n\nWe can find C_n by taking the inner product with respect to sin(mπx) and using orthogonality:\n\n∫[x(1-x)*sin(mπx)dx] = C_m\n\nIntegrate from 0 to 1:\n\nC_m = ∫[x(1-x)*sin(mπx)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nUsing integration by parts twice, we get:\n\nC_m = (2*(-1)^m)/(m^3π^3)\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution in the bar for t > 0 is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[(2*(-1)^n)/(n^3π^3)*sin(nπx)*exp(-n^2π^2t)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ..."
