    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of length 10 meters and two angles measuring 40 degrees and 90 degrees. Find the perimeter of the triangle using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "Since one of the angles is 90 degrees, we have a right triangle. Let's label the vertices A, B, and C, with A being the right angle, B being the 40-degree angle, and C being the 50-degree angle (since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees). Let the side opposite angle B be b, the side opposite angle C be c, and the side opposite angle A (the hypotenuse) be a. We are given that the base (side c) is 10 meters long.\n\nWe can use the sine and cosine functions to find the lengths of the other two sides. \n\nsin(B) = opposite/hypotenuse = b/a\ncos(B) = adjacent/hypotenuse = c/a\n\nWe know the angle B (40 degrees) and the length of side c (10 meters). We can use the cosine function to find the length of the hypotenuse (side a):\n\ncos(40) = 10/a\na = 10/cos(40)\n\nNow we can use the sine function to find the length of side b:\n\nsin(40) = b/a\nb = a * sin(40)\n\nSubstitute the expression for a from the cosine equation:\n\nb = (10/cos(40)) * sin(40)\n\nNow we can calculate the lengths of sides a and b:\n\na ≈ 10/cos(40) ≈ 13.23 meters\nb ≈ (10/cos(40)) * sin(40) ≈ 8.38 meters\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c ≈ 13.23 + 8.38 + 10 ≈ 31.61 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 31.61 meters."
