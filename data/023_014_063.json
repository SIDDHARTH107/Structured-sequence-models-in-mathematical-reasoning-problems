The wave function of an electron in this potential is given by,\n\n𝜓(x) = A sin(πx/L), - L/2 < x < L/2\notherwise 𝜓(x) = 0.\n\nUse the Fourier transform to determine the momentum space wave function and calculate the expectation value of momentum.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to normalize the wave function 𝜓(x). To do this, we set the integral of the square of the wave function over the entire space equal to 1:\n\n∫[A sin(πx/L)]^2 dx = 1, where the integral is taken from -L/2 to L/2.\n\nA^2 ∫[sin^2(πx/L)] dx = 1, from -L/2 to L/2.\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use the identity sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2:\n\nA^2 ∫[(1 - cos(2πx/L))/2] dx = 1, from -L/2 to L/2.\n\nA^2 [(1/2)x - (L/4π)sin(2πx/L)] = 1, evaluated from -L/2 to L/2.\n\nA^2 [L - 0] = 1\n\nA = sqrt(1/L) = sqrt(1/5 nm).\n\nNow, we can find the momentum space wave function 𝜓(p) using the Fourier transform:\n\n𝜓(p) = (1/sqrt(2πħ)) ∫𝜓(x) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx, from -L/2 to L/2.\n\nPlugging in the normalized wave function:\n\n𝜓(p) = (1/sqrt(2πħ)) ∫[sqrt(1/5 nm) sin(πx/5 nm)] e^(-ipx/ħ) dx, from -5/2 nm to 5/2 nm.\n\nThis integral is quite complex, but it can be solved analytically or numerically. The result is:\n\n𝜓(p) = (2ħ/πp) [cos(pL/2ħ) - cos(pL/ħ)].\n\nNow, we can calculate the expectation value of momentum:\n\n⟨p⟩ = ∫p |𝜓(p)|^2 dp, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nHowever, since the wave function is symmetric, the expectation value of momentum is zero:\n\n⟨p⟩ = 0.\n\nThis result makes sense because the electron is confined in a symmetric potential well, so there is no preferred direction for its momentum."
