    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1, 2, 3}\nB - A = {6, 7, 8}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {6, 7, 8} = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A and the complement of B. We will assume the universal set U contains all the elements from 1 to 10.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nA' = U - A = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' - B') ∪ (B' - A')\n\nA' - B' = {6, 7, 8}\nB' - A' = {1, 2, 3}\n\nA' ∆ B' = {6, 7, 8} ∪ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {4, 5, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of the complement of A and the complement of B is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}, while the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B is {4, 5, 9, 10}. These two sets are not equal, so the symmetric difference of the complement of A and the complement of B is not equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B."
