    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of f(x) using the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient of the function at any point x.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 + 4x) = 2x + 4\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method with the given parameters:\n\nInitial guess: x0 = 5\nLearning rate: α = 0.1\nStopping criterion: ε = 0.001\nMaximum iterations: 50\n\nWe will update our guess for x using the following formula:\n\nx_new = x_old - α * f'(x_old)\n\nLet's start iterating:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 5 - 0.1 * (2 * 5 + 4) = 5 - 0.1 * 14 = 3.6\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 3.6 - 0.1 * (2 * 3.6 + 4) = 3.6 - 0.1 * 11.2 = 2.48\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = 2.48 - 0.1 * (2 * 2.48 + 4) = 2.48 - 0.1 * 8.96 = 1.584\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = 1.584 - 0.1 * (2 * 1.584 + 4) = 1.584 - 0.1 * 7.168 = 0.8704\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = 0.8704 - 0.1 * (2 * 0.8704 + 4) = 0.8704 - 0.1 * 5.7408 = 0.30208\n\nIteration 6:\nx6 = 0.30208 - 0.1 * (2 * 0.30208 + 4) = 0.30208 - 0.1 * 4.60416 = -0.158336\n\nIteration 7:\nx7 = -0.158336 - 0.1 * (2 * -0.158336 + 4) = -0.158336 - 0.1 * 3.683328 = -0.5266656\n\nAt this point, the change in x is less than the stopping criterion ε = 0.001, so we can stop iterating.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of f(x) using the last value of x:\n\nf(x7) = (-0.5266656)^2 + 4 * (-0.5266656) = 0.277350 - 2.1066624 = -1.8293124\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) is approximately -1.8293124 when x is approximately -0.5266656."
