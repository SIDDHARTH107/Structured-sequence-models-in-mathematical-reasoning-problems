    "message_1": "A steel rod with a length of 2 meters and a diameter of 0.05 meters is insulated along its sides and initially has a temperature of 200°C. It is then placed in a room with a constant temperature of 20°C. Using the heat transfer and diffusion equation, calculate how long it will take for the temperature at the center of the rod to drop to 100°C. The thermal diffusivity of steel is given as 0.0000025 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the one-dimensional heat diffusion equation for a semi-infinite solid, which is given by:\n\nT(x,t) = T_initial + (T_surface - T_initial) * erf(x / (2 * sqrt(alpha * t)))\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, T_initial is the initial temperature of the rod (200°C), T_surface is the temperature of the surrounding environment (20°C), alpha is the thermal diffusivity of the material (0.0000025 m²/s), and erf is the error function.\n\nWe want to find the time it takes for the temperature at the center of the rod (x = 0) to drop to 100°C. So, we can set T(0,t) = 100°C and solve for t:\n\n100 = 200 + (20 - 200) * erf(0 / (2 * sqrt(0.0000025 * t)))\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n80 = 180 * erf(0 / (2 * sqrt(0.0000025 * t)))\n\nDivide both sides by 180:\n\n80/180 = erf(0 / (2 * sqrt(0.0000025 * t)))\n\n0.4444 = erf(0 / (2 * sqrt(0.0000025 * t)))\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse error function (erf_inv) of 0.4444:\n\nerf_inv(0.4444) = 0 / (2 * sqrt(0.0000025 * t))\n\nSince erf_inv(0.4444) ≈ 0.4769:\n\n0.4769 = 0 / (2 * sqrt(0.0000025 * t))\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n0.4769^2 = (0 / (2 * sqrt(0.0000025 * t)))^2\n\n0.2273 = 0 / (4 * 0.0000025 * t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.00001 (4 * 0.0000025):\n\n22730 = 0 / t\n\nSince 0 divided by any number is 0, this equation has no solution for t. This means that, under the given conditions, the temperature at the center of the rod will never reach 100°C."
