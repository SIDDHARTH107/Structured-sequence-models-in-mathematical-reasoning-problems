    "message_2": "To find the volume of the largest sphere that can be inscribed inside the cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere. Since the sphere touches all six faces of the cube, its diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Edge length of the cube = 8 cm\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of its diameter:\n\nRadius = Diameter / 2 = 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (4 cm)^3\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 64 cm^3\n\nVolume ≈ 268.08 cm^3\n\nRounded to the nearest cubic centimeter, the volume of the largest sphere that can be inscribed inside the cube is approximately 268 cm^3."
