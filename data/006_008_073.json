    "message_1": "A student wants to know the probability of it raining on a particular day in a particular city. From the historical data, the probability of it raining on any given day is 30%. If the student plans to visit the city for 5 consecutive days, what is the probability that it will rain on at least one of those days?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of it raining on at least one of the 5 days, we can first find the probability of it not raining on any of those days and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of it not raining on a particular day is 1 - 0.30 = 0.70.\n\nFor 5 consecutive days, the probability of it not raining on all of those days is (0.70)^5 = 0.16807.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of it raining on at least one of those days:\n\n1 - 0.16807 = 0.83193.\n\nSo, the probability of it raining on at least one of the 5 consecutive days is approximately 83.19%."
