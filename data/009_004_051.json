    "message_2": "To find the position of the mass as a function of time, we can use the equation for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the position of the mass at time t, A is the amplitude of the motion, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency ω. We can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nω = sqrt(5 N/m / 2 kg) = sqrt(2.5 s^(-2)) ≈ 1.58 rad/s\n\nSince the system is initially at rest and displaced 0.1 m from equilibrium, the initial conditions are:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.1 m\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(φ) = 0 m/s\n\nSince v(0) = 0, this implies that sin(φ) = 0. Therefore, φ must be either 0 or π. Since x(0) = 0.1 m, we can see that φ = 0 (because cos(0) = 1 and cos(π) = -1).\n\nNow we can plug in the values for A, ω, and φ into the equation for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = 0.1 m * cos(1.58 rad/s * t)\n\nThis is the position of the mass as a function of time for the given spring-mass system with no damping."
