    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(t) = 3 - |cos(t)|, we first need to express it as a sum of sines and cosines. Since the function is even, we only need to find the Fourier cosine series. The Fourier series of an even function is given by:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n*t)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients, which can be calculated as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(t)] dt from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(t) * cos(n*t)] dt from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[3 - |cos(t)|] dt from -π to π\n\nSince |cos(t)| is even, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[3 - cos(t)] dt from 0 to π + ∫[3 + cos(t)] dt from -π to 0]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[3 - cos(t)] dt from 0 to π + ∫[3 + cos(t)] dt from -π to 0]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(3t - sin(t))|_0^π + (3t + sin(t))|_-π^0]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(3π - 0) + (0 - (-3π))]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * 6π\n\na_0 = 6\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(t) * cos(n*t)] dt from -π to π\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[3*cos(n*t) - cos(t)*cos(n*t)] dt from 0 to π + ∫[3*cos(n*t) + cos(t)*cos(n*t)] dt from -π to 0]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[3*cos(n*t) - cos(t)*cos(n*t)] dt from 0 to π + ∫[3*cos(n*t) + cos(t)*cos(n*t)] dt from -π to 0]\n\nNow, we can use the product-to-sum formula for cos(t)*cos(n*t):\n\ncos(t)*cos(n*t) = (1/2) * [cos((n-1)*t) + cos((n+1)*t)]\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[3*cos(n*t) - (1/2) * [cos((n-1)*t) + cos((n+1)*t)]] dt from 0 to π + ∫[3*cos(n*t) + (1/2) * [cos((n-1)*t) + cos((n+1)*t)]] dt from -π to 0]\n\nNow, integrate each term:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(3*sin(n*t)/n - (1/2) * [sin((n-1)*t)/(n-1) + sin((n+1)*t)/(n+1)])|_0^π + (3*sin(n*t)/n + (1/2) * [sin((n-1)*t)/(n-1) + sin((n+1)*t)/(n+1)])|_-π^0]\n\nSince sin(n*π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the integral simplifies to:\n\na_n = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(t) = 3 - |cos(t)| is:\n\nf(t) = 6"
