    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t.\n\nFirst derivatives:\n$x'(t) = 4t$\n$y'(t) = 3$\n$z'(t) = 3t^2 - 3$\n\nSecond derivatives:\n$x''(t) = 4$\n$y''(t) = 0$\n$z''(t) = 6t$\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\n$k(t) = \\frac{||r'(t) \\times r''(t)||}{||r'(t)||^3}$\n\nwhere r'(t) is the first derivative vector and r''(t) is the second derivative vector.\n\nAt t = 2, the first and second derivative vectors are:\n\n$r'(2) = \\langle 4(2), 3, 3(2)^2 - 3 \\rangle = \\langle 8, 3, 9 \\rangle$\n$r''(2) = \\langle 4, 0, 6(2) \\rangle = \\langle 4, 0, 12 \\rangle$\n\nNow, we find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\n$r'(t) \\times r''(t) = \\langle 3(12) - 9(0), 9(4) - 12(8), 8(0) - 4(3) \\rangle = \\langle 36, -60, -12 \\rangle$\n\nNext, we find the magnitudes of the cross product and r'(t):\n\n$||r'(t) \\times r''(t)|| = \\sqrt{36^2 + (-60)^2 + (-12)^2} = \\sqrt{5184} = 72$\n$||r'(t)|| = \\sqrt{8^2 + 3^2 + 9^2} = \\sqrt{154}$\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\n$k(2) = \\frac{72}{(\\sqrt{154})^3} = \\frac{72}{154\\sqrt{154}} \\approx 0.184$\n\nTo find the torsion (τ), we use the formula:\n\n$τ(t) = \\frac{(r'(t) \\times r''(t)) \\cdot r'''(t)}{||r'(t) \\times r''(t)||^2}$\n\nFirst, we need to find the third derivative:\n\n$r'''(t) = \\langle 0, 0, 6 \\rangle$\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of the cross product and the third derivative:\n\n$(r'(t) \\times r''(t)) \\cdot r'''(t) = 36(0) + (-60)(0) + (-12)(6) = -72$\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion:\n\n$τ(2) = \\frac{-72}{72^2} = -\\frac{1}{72}$\n\nSo, the curvature at t = 2 is approximately 0.184, and the torsion at t = 2 is -1/72."
