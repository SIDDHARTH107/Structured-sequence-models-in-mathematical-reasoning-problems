    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of Optimal portfolio selection:\n\nSuppose you have $50,000 to invest in a portfolio consisting of two assets: stocks and bonds. The expected returns for the two assets are 10% and 5%, respectively, with standard deviations of 12% and 3%, respectively. The correlation between the two assets is 0.6. What is the optimal portfolio allocation between stocks and bonds that maximizes your expected return, given a risk tolerance of no more than 10% (i.e., the standard deviation of the portfolio must be no more than 10%)?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio allocation, we need to calculate the weights of stocks and bonds that maximize the expected return while keeping the portfolio's standard deviation below 10%. Let's denote the weight of stocks as w_s and the weight of bonds as w_b.\n\nSince the total weight of the portfolio must be 100%, we have:\n\nw_s + w_b = 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected return and standard deviation of the portfolio. The expected return of the portfolio (R_p) is given by:\n\nR_p = w_s * R_s + w_b * R_b\n\nwhere R_s and R_b are the expected returns of stocks and bonds, respectively (10% and 5%).\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio (σ_p) is given by:\n\nσ_p = sqrt((w_s * σ_s)^2 + (w_b * σ_b)^2 + 2 * w_s * w_b * σ_s * σ_b * ρ)\n\nwhere σ_s and σ_b are the standard deviations of stocks and bonds, respectively (12% and 3%), and ρ is the correlation between the two assets (0.6).\n\nOur goal is to maximize R_p while keeping σ_p ≤ 10%. We can use the constraint w_s + w_b = 1 to eliminate one of the variables. Let's solve for w_s:\n\nw_s = 1 - w_b\n\nNow, substitute this expression into the equation for σ_p:\n\nσ_p = sqrt(((1 - w_b) * σ_s)^2 + (w_b * σ_b)^2 + 2 * (1 - w_b) * w_b * σ_s * σ_b * ρ)\n\nWe want to find the value of w_b that maximizes R_p while keeping σ_p ≤ 10%. This can be done by trying different values of w_b and calculating the corresponding values of R_p and σ_p. After trying different values, we find that:\n\nw_b ≈ 0.556\nw_s ≈ 0.444\n\nThis allocation results in:\n\nR_p ≈ 7.22%\nσ_p ≈ 10%\n\nSo, the optimal portfolio allocation is approximately 44.4% in stocks and 55.6% in bonds. In terms of the initial investment of $50,000, this means investing $22,200 in stocks and $27,800 in bonds."
