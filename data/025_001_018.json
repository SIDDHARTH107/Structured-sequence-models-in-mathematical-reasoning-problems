    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nIn this case, the two curves are:\n\n$C_1 : x^2 + y^2 - 9 = 0$ (degree 2)\n\n$C_2 : 2x^2 + 2y^2 - 25 = 0$ (degree 2)\n\nThe product of their degrees is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. Therefore, according to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ is 4, counted with multiplicity.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any common components between the two curves. If we multiply the equation of $C_1$ by 2, we get:\n\n$2(x^2 + y^2 - 9) = 2x^2 + 2y^2 - 18$\n\nComparing this with the equation of $C_2$, we can see that they do not have any common components. Therefore, the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ is indeed 4."
