    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 48 = 2^4 * 3\n2. Determine the number of abelian groups: There are 5 abelian groups of order 48, which are direct products of cyclic groups of orders dividing 48.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups: To do this, we can use the fact that the number of groups of order p^k (where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer) is given by the number of partitions of k. In our case, p = 2 and k = 4, so there are 5 partitions of 4: (4), (3, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1, 1). Each partition corresponds to a different Sylow 2-subgroup of the group of order 48. We can then analyze each case and eliminate duplicates or isomorphic groups.\n\nAfter analyzing each case, we find that there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. C_48 (cyclic group)\n2. C_24 x C_2\n3. C_16 x C_3\n4. C_8 x C_6\n5. C_4 x C_12\n6. C_4 x C_4 x C_3 (elementary abelian group)\n7. QD_48 (generalized quaternion group)\n8. SD_48 (semi-dihedral group)\n9. A_4 x C_4 (direct product of the alternating group of degree 4 and a cyclic group of order 4)\n10. (C_2 x C_2) ⋊ C_12 (a non-split extension of C_2 x C_2 by C_12)\n\nSo, there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
