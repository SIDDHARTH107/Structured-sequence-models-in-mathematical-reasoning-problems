    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The given SDE is a geometric Brownian motion, and its solution is given by:\n\n$$X_t = X_0 e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_1 > 60$. To do this, we will first find the distribution of $X_1$. We know that $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, so $W_1$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1, i.e., $W_1 \\sim N(0, 1)$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$X_1 = 50 e^{(0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2) + 0.2 W_1}$$\n\nNow, let's define a new random variable $Y = \\ln{\\frac{X_1}{50}}$. Then, we have:\n\n$$Y = (0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2) + 0.2 W_1$$\n\nSince $W_1$ is normally distributed, $Y$ is also normally distributed with mean $(0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2)$ and variance $(0.2)^2$. Therefore, $Y \\sim N(0.02, 0.04)$.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_1 > 60$. This is equivalent to finding the probability that $Y > \\ln{\\frac{60}{50}} = \\ln{1.2}$. To find this probability, we can standardize $Y$ by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation:\n\n$$Z = \\frac{Y - 0.02}{\\sqrt{0.04}}$$\n\n$Z$ is a standard normal random variable, i.e., $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. Now, we want to find the probability that $Z > \\frac{\\ln{1.2} - 0.02}{\\sqrt{0.04}}$. Using a standard normal table or a calculator, we find that:\n\n$$P(Z > \\frac{\\ln{1.2} - 0.02}{\\sqrt{0.04}}) \\approx 0.2265$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that $X_1 > 60$ is approximately 0.2265."
