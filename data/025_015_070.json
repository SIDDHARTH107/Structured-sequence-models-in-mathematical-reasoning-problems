    "message_2": "To find the intersection of the surfaces, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n(1) $xy - z^2 = 1$\n(2) $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9$\n\nFirst, we can solve equation (1) for one of the variables, say $z^2$. We get:\n\n$z^2 = xy - 1$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $z^2$ into equation (2):\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + (xy - 1) = 9$\n\nRearrange the terms:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + xy - 1 = 9$\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + xy - 10 = 0$\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation in two variables. To solve it, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution. Solve equation (1) for $y$:\n\n$y = \\frac{z^2 + 1}{x}$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $y$ into the quadratic equation:\n\n$x^2 + \\left(\\frac{z^2 + 1}{x}\\right)^2 + x\\left(\\frac{z^2 + 1}{x}\\right) - 10 = 0$\n\nMultiply both sides by $x^2$ to eliminate the fractions:\n\n$x^4 + (z^2 + 1)^2 + x^2(z^2 + 1) - 10x^2 = 0$\n\nNow we have a quartic equation in $x$ and $z$. It's difficult to solve it analytically, so we can use numerical methods or graphical methods to find the intersection points. However, we can try to simplify it further by making a substitution. Let $u = x^2$ and $v = z^2$. Then the equation becomes:\n\n$u^2 + (v + 1)^2 + u(v + 1) - 10u = 0$\n\nNow we have a quartic equation in $u$ and $v$. We can try to solve it numerically or graphically to find the intersection points. Once we find the values of $u$ and $v$, we can substitute back $x^2$ and $z^2$ to find the corresponding $x$, $y$, and $z$ values."
