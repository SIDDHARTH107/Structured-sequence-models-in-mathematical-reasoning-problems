    "message_2": "To find the geodesic connecting the points $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ on the surface $z = x^2 + y^2$, we will use the calculus of variations. The geodesic is the curve that minimizes the length between the two points on the surface. The length of a curve on the surface can be expressed as:\n\n$$L = \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\sqrt{(\\frac{dx}{dt})^2 + (\\frac{dy}{dt})^2 + (\\frac{dz}{dt})^2} dt$$\n\nSince $z = x^2 + y^2$, we have $\\frac{dz}{dt} = 2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt}$. Substituting this into the length expression, we get:\n\n$$L = \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\sqrt{(\\frac{dx}{dt})^2 + (\\frac{dy}{dt})^2 + (2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt})^2} dt$$\n\nLet $x(t) = x$ and $y(t) = y$. We want to minimize $L$ with respect to the functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. To do this, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equations. The Euler-Lagrange equations for this problem are:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial (\\frac{dx}{dt})} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial (\\frac{dy}{dt})} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0$$\n\nWhere $F = \\sqrt{(\\frac{dx}{dt})^2 + (\\frac{dy}{dt})^2 + (2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt})^2}$.\n\nComputing the necessary partial derivatives and substituting them into the Euler-Lagrange equations, we obtain a system of two second-order differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - 4x(\\frac{dx}{dt})^2 - 4xy\\frac{dx}{dt}\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - 4y(\\frac{dy}{dt})^2 - 4xy\\frac{dx}{dt}\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$$\n\nSolving this system of differential equations is quite challenging. However, we can make some observations that simplify the problem. Since the surface is rotationally symmetric about the z-axis, we can assume without loss of generality that the geodesic lies in the plane $y = x$. In this case, the differential equations simplify to:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - 4x(\\frac{dx}{dt})^2 = 0$$\n\nThis equation can be solved by substituting $u = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ and solving the resulting first-order differential equation. The solution is:\n\n$$x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} (t^2 + C_1t + C_2)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $x(0) = 0$ and $x(1) = 1$, we find $C_1 = 2$ and $C_2 = 0$. Thus, the geodesic is given by:\n\n$$x(t) = y(t) = \\frac{1}{2} (t^2 + 2t)$$\n\nAnd the corresponding $z(t)$ is:\n\n$$z(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = 2x(t)^2 = t^2 + 2t$$\n\nSo, the geodesic connecting the points $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ on the surface $z = x^2 + y^2$ is given by the parametric equations:\n\n$$x(t) = y(t) = \\frac{1}{2} (t^2 + 2t), \\quad z(t) = t^2 + 2t, \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq 1$$"
