    "message_1": "In a pizza parlor, customers can choose toppings from mushrooms, onions, and olives. If a customer chooses 2 toppings, how many different topping combinations are possible?",
    "message_2": "There are 3 toppings to choose from, and customers can choose 2 toppings. We can use the combination formula to find the number of different topping combinations possible:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of toppings and k is the number of toppings chosen.\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!)\n\nC(3, 2) = 6 / (2 * 1)\n\nC(3, 2) = 6 / 2\n\nC(3, 2) = 3\n\nSo, there are 3 different topping combinations possible when choosing 2 toppings from mushrooms, onions, and olives."
