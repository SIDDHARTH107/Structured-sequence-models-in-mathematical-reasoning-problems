    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the functions with respect to x and y:\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 10 and g(x, y) = xy - 4.\n\nPartial derivatives:\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂g/∂x = y\n∂g/∂y = x\n\nNow, we need to set up the iteration formula for Newton's method for systems of equations:\n\n(x_new, y_new) = (x_old, y_old) - J^(-1)(x_old, y_old) * F(x_old, y_old)\n\nwhere J^(-1) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix J, and F is the vector of functions (f, g).\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y |\n      | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |\n\nJ = | 2x   2y |\n      | y    x  |\n\nThe inverse of the Jacobian matrix J^(-1) is:\n\nJ^(-1) = (1 / (2x^2 - 2y^2)) * | x   -2y |\n                                              | -y   2x  |\n\nNow, we can set up the iteration formula:\n\n(x_new, y_new) = (x_old, y_old) - (1 / (2x_old^2 - 2y_old^2)) * | x_old   -2y_old | * | f(x_old, y_old) |\n                                                                                                  | -y_old   2x_old |   | g(x_old, y_old) |\n\nChoose an initial guess (x0, y0). Let's use (x0, y0) = (1, 1) as our initial guess.\n\nNow, we can iterate using the formula until the solutions converge to the desired accuracy (4 decimal places):\n\n1st iteration:\n(x1, y1) = (1, 1) - (1 / (2 - 2)) * | 1   -2 | * | -8 |\n                                                   | -1   2 |   | -3 |\n\nSince the denominator is 0, we need to choose a different initial guess. Let's try (x0, y0) = (2, 2):\n\n1st iteration:\n(x1, y1) = (2, 2) - (1 / (8 - 8)) * | 2   -4 | * | 0 |\n                                                   | -2   4 |   | 0 |\n\nAgain, the denominator is 0.
