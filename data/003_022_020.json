    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(4² + (-3)²) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √((-2)² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B. We can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = A_x * B_x + A_y * B_y\n\nA · B = (4 * -2) + (-3 * 5) = -8 - 15 = -23\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (-23) / (5 * √29)\n\nθ = arccos((-23) / (5 * √29))\n\nNow, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nA · B = 5 * √29 * cos(θ)\n\nSince we already found the dot product to be -23, we can confirm our result:\n\n-23 = 5 * √29 * cos(θ)\n\nSo, the dot product of the vectors A = [4, -3] and B = [-2, 5] using trigonometry is -23."
