    "message_2": "We can model this situation using the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time (in this case, days) with a known average rate (λ = 0.5 accidents per day).\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (accidents), k is the desired number of events (in this case, 0 accidents), λ is the average rate of events (0.5 accidents per day), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability of having no accidents (k = 0) for 3 consecutive days. Since the days are independent, we can find the probability for one day and then raise it to the power of 3.\n\nFor one day, we have:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.5) * (0.5^0)) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.5) * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) = e^(-0.5)\n\nFor three consecutive days:\n\nP(X = 0 for 3 days) = (e^(-0.5))^3\nP(X = 0 for 3 days) = e^(-1.5)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value:\n\nP(X = 0 for 3 days) ≈ e^(-1.5) ≈ 0.22313\n\nSo, the probability of having no accidents in the factory for 3 consecutive days is approximately 0.22313, or 22.313%."
