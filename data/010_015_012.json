    "message_2": "To calculate the first De Rham cohomology class of S using ω, we need to find the exterior derivative of ω and check if it is exact or closed.\n\nFirst, let's compute the exterior derivative dω. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form, and it is given by:\n\ndω = (∂ω/∂x)dx ∧ dx + (∂ω/∂y)dy ∧ dx + (∂ω/∂z)dz ∧ dx + (∂ω/∂x)dx ∧ dy + (∂ω/∂y)dy ∧ dy + (∂ω/∂z)dz ∧ dy + (∂ω/∂x)dx ∧ dz + (∂ω/∂y)dy ∧ dz + (∂ω/∂z)dz ∧ dz\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives of ω:\n\n∂ω/∂x = ∂(xy)/∂x dx + ∂(xz)/∂x dy + ∂(yz)/∂x dz = y dx + z dy\n∂ω/∂y = ∂(xy)/∂y dx + ∂(xz)/∂y dy + ∂(yz)/∂y dz = x dx + z dz\n∂ω/∂z = ∂(xy)/∂z dx + ∂(xz)/∂z dy + ∂(yz)/∂z dz = x dy + y dz\n\nNow, we can plug these partial derivatives back into the expression for dω:\n\ndω = y dx ∧ dx + z dy ∧ dx + x dx ∧ dy + z dz ∧ dy + x dy ∧ dz + y dz ∧ dz\n\nSince dx ∧ dx = dy ∧ dy = dz ∧ dz = 0, we can simplify the expression to:\n\ndω = z dy ∧ dx + x dx ∧ dy + x dy ∧ dz + y dz ∧ dz = (z - x) dy ∧ dx + x dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, we need to check if dω is exact or closed. A 2-form is closed if its exterior derivative is zero, and it is exact if it is the exterior derivative of some 1-form.\n\nFirst, let's check if dω is closed:\n\nddω = d((z - x) dy ∧ dx + x dy ∧ dz)\n\nSince the exterior derivative of a 2-form in R^3 is always zero, we have:\n\nddω = 0\n\nTherefore, dω is closed.\n\nNow, we need to check if dω is exact. Suppose dω is exact, then there exists a 1-form η such that dη = dω. However, since S is a closed 2-dimensional surface, it has no boundary, and by Stokes' theorem, the integral of dω over S must be zero:\n\n∫∫_S dω = 0\n\nBut, looking at the expression for dω, we can see that it is not identically zero:\n\ndω = (z - x) dy ∧ dx + x dy ∧ dz\n\nThus, dω is not exact.\n\nSince dω is closed but not exact, the first De Rham cohomology class of S using ω is nontrivial."
