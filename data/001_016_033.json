    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $2^{4} \\cdot 2^{6}$, we use the rule for multiplying exponential expressions with the same base: $a^{m} \\cdot a^{n} = a^{m+n}$. In this case, the base is 2, and the exponents are 4 and 6. \n\nSo, $2^{4} \\cdot 2^{6} = 2^{4+6} = 2^{10}$. The simplified exponential expression is $2^{10}$."
