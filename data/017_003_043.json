    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element a in G such that its order is equal to p. Let's first consider the case when the order of an element a in G is not equal to p.\n\nLet the order of a be k, so a^k = e (identity element in G), and k is the smallest positive integer with this property. Since G has prime order p, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, k must divide p. \n\nSince p is prime, its only divisors are 1 and p itself. We know that the order of a is not equal to p, so k must be 1. This means that a^1 = e, which implies that a is the identity element of G.\n\nHowever, this does not prove that G is cyclic, as we only considered the case when the order of an element a in G is not equal to p. To prove that G is cyclic, we need to find an element a in G with order p.\n\nConsider the element g in G, where g is not the identity element. Since the order of g is not 1, by the previous argument, the order of g must be p. Therefore, G is generated by g and is cyclic."
