    "message_2": "First, let's break down the expression into smaller parts and evaluate them using the given truth values of p, q, and r:\n\np is true, q is false, and r is true.\n\n1. p → q (If p, then q): Since p is true and q is false, this implication is false.\n\n2. p ∨ r (p or r): Since p is true and r is true, this disjunction is true.\n\n3. q ↔ r (q if and only if r): Since q is false and r is true, this biconditional is false.\n\nNow let's evaluate the larger expression using the results from above:\n\n[(p → q) ∧ (p ∨ r)] ⊕ (q ↔ r)\n\n[(False) ∧ (True)] ⊕ (False)\n\n[False] ⊕ [False]\n\nThe ⊕ symbol represents the exclusive or (XOR) operation, which is true if and only if one of the operands is true, but not both. In this case, both operands are false, so the result is:\n\nFalse"
