    "message_2": "Let V be the volume of the water in the tank and h be the height of the water. We are given that the base of the tank has dimensions 3 meters by 4 meters, so the area of the base is A = 3 * 4 = 12 square meters. The volume of the water in the tank can be expressed as V = A * h = 12h cubic meters.\n\nWe are given that water is flowing into the tank at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute, so dV/dt = 2 cubic meters per minute.\n\nWe want to find the rate at which the water level is rising, which is dh/dt, when the water is 2 meters deep (h = 2 meters).\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can relate dV/dt and dh/dt as follows:\n\ndV/dt = (dV/dh) * (dh/dt)\n\nWe already know dV/dt = 2, and we can find dV/dh by differentiating V = 12h with respect to h:\n\ndV/dh = 12\n\nNow we can solve for dh/dt:\n\n2 = 12 * (dh/dt)\n\ndh/dt = 2 / 12 = 1/6\n\nSo, the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 2 meters deep is 1/6 meters per minute."
