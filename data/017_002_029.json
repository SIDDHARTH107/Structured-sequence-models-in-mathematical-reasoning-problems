    "message_2": "To find all the distinct subgroups of G, we need to find all the divisors of the order of G. The order of G is the number of elements in G, which is 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. For each divisor, we will find a subgroup of that order.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup, which contains only the identity element. In this case, the identity element is 48 (since 48 is the smallest multiple of 8 that is congruent to 0 modulo 48). So, the subgroup is {48}. This subgroup is cyclic, as it only has one element.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2: We need to find an element in G with order 2. The order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that the element raised to the power of n is equal to the identity element. In this case, the element 24 has order 2, since 24 * 24 = 48 (mod 48). Thus, the subgroup generated by 24 is {24, 48}, which is cyclic.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 3: We need to find an element in G with order 3. The element 16 has order 3, since 16 * 16 = 32 (mod 48) and 16 * 16 * 16 = 48 (mod 48). Thus, the subgroup generated by 16 is {16, 32, 48}, which is cyclic.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 6: The entire group G itself is a subgroup of order 6. Since G is generated by the element 8, it is cyclic by definition.\n\nIn summary, the distinct subgroups of G are {48}, {24, 48}, {16, 32, 48}, and G itself. Each of these subgroups is cyclic, as shown above."
