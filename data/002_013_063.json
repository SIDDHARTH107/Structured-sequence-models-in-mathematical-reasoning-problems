    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base with a length of 6 cm and a width of 5 cm. Its height is 9 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width\nBase Area = 6 cm * 5 cm\nBase Area = 30 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume by plugging the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 30 cm² * 9 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 270 cm³\nVolume = 90 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 90 cubic centimeters."
