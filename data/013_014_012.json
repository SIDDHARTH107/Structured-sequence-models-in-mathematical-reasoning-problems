    "message_1": "Consider a sealed bid auction where three bidders, A, B, and C, are bidding for an item. The value that each bidder holds for the item is as follows: \n\n- A values the item at $50\n- B values the item at $70\n- C values the item at $90\n\nAssuming that the auction winner is the person who bids the highest, what is the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder if the auction follows the second price sealed bid rule? (In the second price sealed bid rule auction, the winner pays the price of the second highest bid.)",
    "message_2": "In a second price sealed bid auction, the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation of the item. This is because they will only pay the second highest bid if they win, and bidding their true valuation ensures that they do not overpay for the item.\n\nSo, the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder is:\n\n- A should bid $50\n- B should bid $70\n- C should bid $90\n\nIn this case, C would win the auction with a bid of $90, but they would only pay the second highest bid, which is $70. This is the optimal outcome for each bidder, as they are not overpaying for the item and are bidding according to their true valuations."
