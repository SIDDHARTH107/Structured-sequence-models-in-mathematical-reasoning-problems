    "message_2": "Let's denote the terms of the sequence as a_n, where n is the position of the term in the sequence. We are given that a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 5, and a_4 = 11. We are also given that the next term is twice the sum of the previous three terms in the sequence, which can be written as:\n\na_n = 2(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})\n\nWe are asked to find the sixth term in the sequence, which is a_6. To do this, we first need to find a_5:\n\na_5 = 2(a_4 + a_3 + a_2) = 2(11 + 5 + 3) = 2(19) = 38\n\nNow that we have a_5, we can find a_6:\n\na_6 = 2(a_5 + a_4 + a_3) = 2(38 + 11 + 5) = 2(54) = 108\n\nSo, the sixth term in the sequence is 108."
