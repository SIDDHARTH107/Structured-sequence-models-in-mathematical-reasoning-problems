    "message_2": "To solve the discrete logarithm problem $3^x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{19}$, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $3^x$ is congruent to $8$ modulo $19$. We can do this by trying different values of $x$ and checking if the congruence holds.\n\n1. For $x = 1$, $3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{19}$, not a solution.\n2. For $x = 2$, $3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{19}$, not a solution.\n3. For $x = 3$, $3^3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{19}$, this is a solution.\n\nSo, the solution to the discrete logarithm problem $3^x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{19}$ is $x = 3$."
