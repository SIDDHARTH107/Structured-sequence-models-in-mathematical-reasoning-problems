    "message_2": "Given that c1(L) = 3a + b, we can square this expression to get:\n\nc1(L)^2 = (3a + b)^2 = 9a^2 + 6ab + b^2.\n\nNow, we are given that c2(X) = 2c1(L)^2. Substituting the expression for c1(L)^2, we get:\n\nc2(X) = 2(9a^2 + 6ab + b^2) = 18a^2 + 12ab + 2b^2.\n\nThus, the value of c2(X) is 18a^2 + 12ab + 2b^2, where a and b are the first and second Chern classes of the Hermitian line bundle M over X."
