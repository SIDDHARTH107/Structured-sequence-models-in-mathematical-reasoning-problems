    "message_2": "To find the output signal y(t) using the transfer function G(s), we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal x(t) = cos(2t).\n\nThe Laplace transform of cos(2t) is given by:\n\nX(s) = L{cos(2t)} = s / (s^2 + 4)\n\nNow, we can find the Laplace transform of the output signal Y(s) by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the Laplace transform of the input signal X(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * X(s) = [(4s + 6) / (s^2 + 5s + 6)] * [s / (s^2 + 4)]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to get y(t):\n\ny(t) = L^-1{Y(s)}\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use partial fraction decomposition. First, we need to simplify Y(s):\n\nY(s) = [(4s + 6) * s] / [(s^2 + 5s + 6) * (s^2 + 4)]\n\nFactor the denominator:\n\nY(s) = (4s^2 + 6s) / [(s + 2)(s + 3)(s^2 + 4)]\n\nNow, perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nY(s) = A / (s + 2) + B / (s + 3) + Cs / (s^2 + 4) + D / (s^2 + 4)\n\nSolving for A, B, C, and D, we get:\n\nA = 1/5\nB = -1/5\nC = 4/5\nD = 6/5\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\ny(t) = L^-1{Y(s)} = L^-1{1/5 / (s + 2)} - L^-1{1/5 / (s + 3)} + L^-1{4/5 * s / (s^2 + 4)} + L^-1{6/5 / (s^2 + 4)}\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform properties and tables, we get:\n\ny(t) = (1/5)e^(-2t) - (1/5)e^(-3t) + (4/5)cos(2t) + (6/5)sin(2t)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of y(t):\n\nY(jω) = F{y(t)} = F{(1/5)e^(-2t)} - F{(1/5)e^(-3t)} + F{(4/5)cos(2t)} + F{(6/5)sin(2t)}\n\nUsing the Fourier transform properties and tables, we get:\n\nY(jω) = (1/5) / (jω + 2) - (1/5) / (jω + 3) + (4/5) * [δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] + (6/5)j * [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the output signal y(t)."
