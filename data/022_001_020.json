    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z - 1), we first look for singularities of the function. The only singularity occurs at z = 1, where the denominator becomes zero. Since this is a simple pole, we can use a Laurent series expansion to find the analytic continuation of f(z) around this point.\n\nFirst, we rewrite f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z - 1) = ((z - 1) + 2)/(z - 1) = 1 + 2/(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can see that f(z) has a simple pole at z = 1 with residue 2. The Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 1 is given by:\n\nf(z) = 1 + 2/(z - 1)\n\nSince there are no other singularities, the analytic continuation of f(z) is well-defined on the entire complex plane except for the point z = 1. Thus, the largest open subset U of the complex plane containing D, for which the continuation is well-defined, is:\n\nU = {z ∈ C | z ≠ 1}"
