    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a cylinder, we need to find the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius of the cylinder is 4 cm, the area of one circular base is:\n\nA = π(4^2) = 16π square centimeters\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n\n2 * 16π = 32π square centimeters\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is the area of the rectangle that wraps around the cylinder, which can be found using the formula A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius is 4 cm and the height is 8 cm, so the lateral surface area is:\n\nA = 2π(4)(8) = 64π square centimeters\n\nFinally, to find the total surface area of the cylinder, we add the area of the bases and the lateral surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 32π + 64π = 96π square centimeters\n\nSince π is approximately 3.14, the total surface area is approximately:\n\n96 * 3.14 ≈ 301.44 square centimeters"
