    "message_1": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, three bidders bid on a painting. Bidder 1 bids $5000, bidder 2 bids $6000, and bidder 3 bids $4500. What is the winning bidder's payoff if the reserve price is set at $4000?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid. In this case, bidder 2 has the highest bid at $6000, and bidder 1 has the second-highest bid at $5000. Since the reserve price is set at $4000, which is lower than the second-highest bid, bidder 2 wins the auction and pays $5000.\n\nTo calculate the winning bidder's payoff, we need to subtract the price they paid from the value they placed on the painting (their bid). In this case, bidder 2's payoff would be:\n\nPayoff = Value - Price Paid\nPayoff = $6000 - $5000\nPayoff = $1000\n\nSo, the winning bidder's payoff is $1000."
