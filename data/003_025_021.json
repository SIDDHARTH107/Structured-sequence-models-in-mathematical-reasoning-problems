    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the car's velocity vector, we can use trigonometry. Since the car is traveling in a northeast direction, we can assume that it is moving at a 45-degree angle with respect to the horizontal (east) and vertical (north) axes.\n\nLet Vx be the horizontal component of the velocity vector (eastward) and Vy be the vertical component of the velocity vector (northward). We can use the sine and cosine functions to find these components:\n\nVx = V * cos(45°)\nVy = V * sin(45°)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the velocity vector (50 km/h in this case).\n\nSince cos(45°) = sin(45°) = √2/2, we can plug in the values:\n\nVx = 50 * (√2/2) ≈ 35.36 km/h (eastward)\nVy = 50 * (√2/2) ≈ 35.36 km/h (northward)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the velocity vector using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV = √(Vx^2 + Vy^2)\nV = √(35.36^2 + 35.36^2) ≈ 50 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector is 50 km/h, which is the same as the given speed of the car.\n\nTo find the direction of the velocity vector, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Vy / Vx)\nθ = arctan(35.36 / 35.36)\n\nSince Vy and Vx are equal, θ = arctan(1) = 45°.\n\nSo, the direction of the velocity vector is 45° with respect to the eastward direction (northeast).\n\nThe magnitude and direction of the car's velocity vector are approximately 50 km/h and 45°, respectively."
