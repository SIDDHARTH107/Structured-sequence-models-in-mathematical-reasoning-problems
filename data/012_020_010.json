    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of the graph G, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency of the vertices. In other words, we need to find all the vertex relabelings that keep the graph structure intact.\n\nThe given graph G can be visualized as follows:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 3\n|    |    |\n5 -- 4 -- |\n\nNow, let's find the automorphisms of G:\n\n1. The identity automorphism (no change in vertex labels):\n   (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n2. Rotating the graph 72 degrees clockwise:\n   (2, 3, 4, 5, 1)\n\n3. Rotating the graph 144 degrees clockwise:\n   (3, 4, 5, 1, 2)\n\n4. Rotating the graph 216 degrees clockwise:\n   (4, 5, 1, 2, 3)\n\n5. Rotating the graph 288 degrees clockwise:\n   (5, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of the graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is:\n\n{ (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4, 5, 1), (3, 4, 5, 1, 2), (4, 5, 1, 2, 3), (5, 1, 2, 3, 4) }\n\nThe order of the automorphism group of G is the number of elements in the group, which is 5."
