    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the graph G, we will use the recursive formula for the Tutte polynomial T(G; x, y), which is defined as follows:\n\n1. If G has no edges, then T(G; x, y) = x^(# of connected components of G).\n2. If G has a loop, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y), where e is the loop.\n3. If G has a bridge, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y), where e is the bridge.\n4. If G has a non-bridge, non-loop edge e, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y), where e is the non-bridge, non-loop edge.\n\nNow, let's find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G:\n\n```\n    5 -- 1 -- 2\n    |    |    |\n    4 -- 3 -- 6\n```\n\nFirst, we will remove a non-bridge, non-loop edge, say edge 1-3:\n\n```\n    5 -- 1 -- 2\n    |         |\n    4 -- 3 -- 6\n```\n\nNow we have two subgraphs, G - e and G / e:\n\nG - e:\n```\n    5 -- 1 -- 2\n    |         |\n    4         6\n```\n\nG / e:\n```\n    5 -- 1 -- 2\n    |    |    |\n    4 -- 6\n```\n\nNow, we will find the Tutte polynomial for each subgraph.\n\nFor G - e, we can remove the non-bridge, non-loop edge 1-2:\n\n```\n    5 -- 1    2\n    |         |\n    4         6\n```\n\nNow we have two subgraphs, G - e - f and G - e / f:\n\nG - e - f:\n```\n    5 -- 1\n    |\n    4\n```\n\nG - e / f:\n```\n    5 -- 1\n    |    |\n    4    6\n```\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for G - e - f is T(G - e - f; x, y) = x^2, since it has 2 connected components with no edges.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for G - e / f is T(G - e / f; x, y) = x, since it has 1 connected component with no edges.\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial for G - e is T(G - e; x, y) = x^2 + x.\n\nFor G / e, we can remove the non-bridge, non-loop edge 1-5:\n\n```\n    5    1 -- 2\n         |    |\n    4 -- 6\n```\n\nNow we have two subgraphs, G / e - g and G / e / g:\n\nG / e - g:\n```\n    1 -- 2\n         |\n    4 -- 6\n```\n\nG / e / g:\n```\n    1 -- 2\n    |    |\n    4 -- 6\n```\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for G / e - g is T(G / e - g; x, y) = x^2, since it has 2 connected components with no edges.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for G / e / g is T(G / e / g; x, y) = x, since it has 1 connected component with no edges.\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial for G / e is T(G / e; x, y) = x^2 + x.\n\nFinally, the Tutte polynomial for the original graph G is T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y) = (x^2 + x) + (x^2 + x) = 2x^2 + 2x."
