    "message_1": "Consider a continuous-time linear dynamical system described by the differential equation:\n\ndy/dt + 2y = x\n\nwhere y(t) is the output and x(t) is the input. If the input is a sinusoidal signal with frequency 5 Hz and amplitude 2, i.e., x(t) = 2 sin(10πt), determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the transfer function H(s) of the system. The transfer function is the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output Y(s) to the Laplace transform of the input X(s).\n\nGiven the differential equation:\n\ndy/dt + 2y = x\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get:\n\nsY(s) - y(0) + 2Y(s) = X(s)\n\nAssuming zero initial conditions (y(0) = 0), we can simplify the equation to:\n\n(s + 2)Y(s) = X(s)\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(s):\n\nH(s) = Y(s) / X(s) = 1 / (s + 2)\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the input signal x(t) = 2 sin(10πt). The Fourier transform of a sinusoidal signal is given by:\n\nX(jω) = π[Aδ(ω - ω0) - Aδ(ω + ω0)]\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω0 is the angular frequency, and δ is the Dirac delta function. In our case, A = 2 and ω0 = 10π. So, the Fourier transform of the input signal is:\n\nX(jω) = π[2δ(ω - 10π) - 2δ(ω + 10π)]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of the output signal Y(jω) by multiplying the transfer function H(s) with the Fourier transform of the input signal X(jω):\n\nY(jω) = H(jω)X(jω) = (1 / (jω + 2)) * π[2δ(ω - 10π) - 2δ(ω + 10π)]\n\nTo determine the stability of the system, we need to check if the output signal Y(jω) is bounded for all ω. The poles of the transfer function H(s) are the values of s that make the denominator zero:\n\njω + 2 = 0\n\nω = -2j\n\nSince the pole has a negative real part, the system is stable. The output signal Y(jω) will be bounded for all ω, and the system will not blow up in response to the sinusoidal input signal."
