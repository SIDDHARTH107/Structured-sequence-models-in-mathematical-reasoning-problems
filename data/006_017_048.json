    "message_1": "In a particular city, the probability of a car accident involving a truck is 0.15 and the probability of a car accident involving an SUV is 0.10. If there are 500 accidents reported every month, how many of them would be expected to involve a truck or an SUV?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of accidents involving a truck or an SUV, we can multiply the total number of accidents by the probability of each type of accident and then add the results together.\n\nExpected number of truck accidents = 500 * 0.15 = 75\nExpected number of SUV accidents = 500 * 0.10 = 50\n\nTotal expected accidents involving a truck or an SUV = 75 + 50 = 125\n\nSo, out of 500 accidents reported every month, 125 of them would be expected to involve a truck or an SUV."
