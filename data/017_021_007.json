    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible partitions for each prime factor's exponent:\n   - For 2^4: (4), (3, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1)\n   - For 3^1: (1)\n3. Use the formula for the number of abelian groups of a given order: \n   - For each partition of 2^4, find the number of abelian groups of order 2^4:\n     * (4): 1 group\n     * (3, 1): 1 group\n     * (2, 2): 1 group\n     * (2, 1, 1): 0 groups (since it's not a valid partition for abelian groups)\n     * (1, 1, 1, 1): 0 groups (since it's not a valid partition for abelian groups)\n   - For each partition of 3^1, find the number of abelian groups of order 3^1:\n     * (1): 1 group\n4. Multiply the number of abelian groups for each prime factor's exponent:\n   - (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) = 3 abelian groups of order 48\n5. Determine the total number of groups of order 48 using the formula for the number of groups of a given order:\n   - For 2^4: 5 groups\n   - For 3^1: 1 group\n   - Total groups: 5 * 1 = 5 groups\n6. Subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups to find the number of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups:\n   - 5 groups - 3 abelian groups = 2 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups\n\nTherefore, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
