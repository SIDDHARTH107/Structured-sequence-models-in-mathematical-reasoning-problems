    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{125}$, we can break down the number 125 into its prime factors.\n\n125 = 5 × 5 × 5\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$\\sqrt{125} = \\sqrt{5^3}$\n\nSince we have three factors of 5, we can take one factor out of the square root:\n\n$\\sqrt{5^3} = 5\\sqrt{5}$\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n$5\\sqrt{5}$."
