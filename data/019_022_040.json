If they allocate 4 hours to Math and 6 hours to English, they score a total of 80 points. If they allocate 5 hours to Math and 5 hours to English, they score a total of 85 points. What is the optimal allocation of study time if the student wants to maximize their total score?",
    "message_2": "Let M be the number of hours spent studying Math, and E be the number of hours spent studying English. Let S(M, E) be the total score obtained by the student. We are given the following information:\n\n1. S(4, 6) = 80\n2. S(5, 5) = 85\n\nWe can assume that the relationship between study time and score is linear for both subjects. Let m be the increase in score per hour of studying Math, and e be the increase in score per hour of studying English. Then, we can write the following equations:\n\n1. 4m + 6e = 80\n2. 5m + 5e = 85\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations to find the values of m and e. We can multiply equation (1) by 5 and equation (2) by 4 to eliminate the variable m:\n\n1. 20m + 30e = 400\n2. 20m + 20e = 340\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate m:\n\n10e = 60\n\nNow, we can solve for e:\n\ne = 60 / 10 = 6\n\nNow that we have the value of e, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find the value of m:\n\n4m + 6(6) = 80\n4m + 36 = 80\n4m = 44\nm = 44 / 4 = 11\n\nNow we have the values of m and e:\n\nm = 11 (points per hour of studying Math)\ne = 6 (points per hour of studying English)\n\nTo maximize the total score, the student should allocate more time to the subject with the higher points per hour, which is Math in this case. However, we don't know the total amount of time the student has to study. Let T be the total study time. Then, the optimal allocation of study time would be:\n\nM = T (all available time should be spent on Math)\nE = 0 (no time should be spent on English)\n\nIn this case, the total score would be:\n\nS(T, 0) = 11T\n\nHowever, if there are any constraints on the minimum or maximum time that can be spent on each subject, the optimal allocation would need to be adjusted accordingly."
