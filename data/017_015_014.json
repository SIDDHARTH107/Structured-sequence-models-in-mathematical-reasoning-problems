    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 24. We know that the order of G is 24 = 2^3 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 or 3 (number of Sylow 2-subgroups)\n2. n_3 = 1 or 4 (number of Sylow 3-subgroups)\n\nWe will analyze these cases to determine the structure of G and its center.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The intersection of P_2 and P_3 is trivial (only contains the identity element), so G is the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C24, and its center is the entire group G.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups of G. Then, the normalizer of P_2 in G, N_G(P_2), has index 3 in G. By the Frattini argument, G = N_G(P_2)P_3. Since P_3 is normal in G, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 8 (up to isomorphism): the cyclic group C8 and the dihedral group D4. For each of these groups, there are two possible actions of P_3 on P_2, giving a total of four non-abelian groups of order 24 in this case. The center of each of these groups is trivial (only contains the identity element).\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Then, the normalizer of P_3 in G, N_G(P_3), has index 4 in G. By the Frattini argument, G = N_G(P_3)P_2. Since P_2 is normal in G, G is a semidirect product of P_3 and P_2. There is only one non-abelian group of order 24 in this case, and its center is trivial (only contains the identity element).\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has no normal Sylow subgroups. However, this case is not possible, as the number of elements of order 2 in G would be 12, but by Cauchy's theorem, there must be an element of order 4 in G, which contradicts the assumption.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C24, in which case its center is the entire group G, or G can be isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24, in which case its center is trivial (only contains the identity element). G cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A5, as A5 has order 60, not 24."
