    "message_1": "A factory produces three products: A, B, and C. The factory can produce a maximum of 200 units per day. The profit per unit is $5 for product A, $8 for product B, and $10 for product C. The demand for product A, B, and C is 150, 100, and 75 units per day, respectively. Each product requires a different amount of time to produce, with the total time available for production being 480 hours per day. It takes 2 hours to produce one unit of product A, 3 hours for product B, and 4 hours for product C. \n\nWhat production plan will maximize the profit for the factory?",
