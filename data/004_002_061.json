    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function (2x^2 - x + 3)/(x - 1) as x approaches 1, we can try to simplify the function first. We can do this by factoring the numerator:\n\n2x^2 - x + 3 = (2x - 1)(x - 1) + 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\n(2x^2 - x + 3)/(x - 1) = [(2x - 1)(x - 1) + 2] / (x - 1)\n\nAs x approaches 1, the term (x - 1) approaches 0. However, we can't simply plug in x = 1 into the function, as that would result in division by zero. Instead, we can rewrite the function as:\n\n(2x^2 - x + 3)/(x - 1) = (2x - 1) + 2/(x - 1)\n\nNow, as x approaches 1, the term 2/(x - 1) approaches 2/0, which is undefined. However, the term (2x - 1) approaches (2*1 - 1) = 1. Therefore, the limit of the function as x approaches 1 is:\n\nlim (x -> 1) (2x^2 - x + 3)/(x - 1) = 1"
