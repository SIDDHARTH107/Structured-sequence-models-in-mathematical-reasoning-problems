    "message_2": "Let's denote the non-abelian group of order 20 as G. Since G is non-abelian and has order 20, it must be isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_5 and Z_4, which we can denote as Z_5 ⋊ Z_4. \n\nNow, let's find the automorphisms of G. First, consider the automorphisms of Z_5 and Z_4. The number of automorphisms of a cyclic group Z_n is given by the Euler's totient function φ(n). So, we have:\n\nφ(5) = 4 (since 5 is prime)\nφ(4) = 2 (since 4 has two relatively prime numbers less than itself: 1 and 3)\n\nNow, we need to consider the action of Z_4 on Z_5. The action is determined by an automorphism of Z_5, which is an element of Aut(Z_5). Since |Aut(Z_5)| = 4, there are 4 possible actions. However, the trivial action (i.e., the identity automorphism) corresponds to the direct product of Z_5 and Z_4, which is an abelian group. Since G is non-abelian, we must exclude the trivial action. This leaves us with 3 non-trivial actions.\n\nTherefore, the total number of automorphisms of G is given by the product of the number of automorphisms of Z_5, the number of automorphisms of Z_4, and the number of non-trivial actions:\n\n|Aut(G)| = φ(5) × φ(4) × 3 = 4 × 2 × 3 = 24\n\nSo, the non-abelian group of order 20 has 24 automorphisms."
