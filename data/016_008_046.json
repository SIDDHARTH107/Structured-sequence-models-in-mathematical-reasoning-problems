    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be found using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, each segment is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can find the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after three iterations (or any number of iterations) is approximately 1.2619. The dimension does not change with the number of iterations, as it is a property of the fractal itself."
