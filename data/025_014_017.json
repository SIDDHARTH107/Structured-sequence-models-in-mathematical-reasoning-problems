    "message_1": "Let's say a math student is studying the Riemann-Roch theorem and wants to apply it to Theta functions. A possible question could be:\n\nLet X be a smooth plane curve of degree 4 defined by the equation $y^2z-x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$, where $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}$ is a parameter, and let $D\\subset X$ be the divisor associated to the point at infinity. We define the theta function on X associated to D by\n$$\n\\vartheta_D(q)=\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}}q^{\\frac{n^2}{2}+\\frac{n}{2}D},\n$$\nwhere $q\\in\\mathbb{C}$ is a complex number. Compute the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle associated to D, that is, determine $h^0(X,\\mathcal{O}_X(D))$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle associated to D, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a smooth curve X of genus g, we have:\n\n$h^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D)) - h^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D)) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nFirst, we need to determine the genus g of the curve X. Since X is a smooth plane curve of degree 4, we can use the formula for the genus of a smooth plane curve:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In this case, d = 4, so:\n\n$g = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2} = 3$\n\nNext, we need to determine the degree of the divisor D. Since D is associated with the point at infinity, it is a divisor of degree 1.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$h^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D)) - h^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D)) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g = 1 + 1 - 3 = -1$\n\nSince $h^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D))$ is non-negative, we must have $h^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D)) = 0$. Therefore, the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle associated to D is 0."
