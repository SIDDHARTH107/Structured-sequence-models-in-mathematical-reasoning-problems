    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B, which require two types of raw materials X and Y. The following table shows the amount of raw materials required per unit of product and the availability of these resources:\n\n| Product | Raw Material X (kg) | Raw Material Y (kg) |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| A       | 2                 | 5                 |\n| B       | 3                 | 8                 |\n| Availability | 200             | 450               |\n\nIf the profit per unit of product A is $10 and for product B is $15, then how many units of each product should the company produce using the artificial bee colony algorithm to maximize their profit, while still staying within the raw material limitations?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we will first define the objective function and constraints. The objective function is the total profit, which we want to maximize:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 10A + 15B\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2A + 3B <= 200 (Raw Material X constraint)\n2. 5A + 8B <= 450 (Raw Material Y constraint)\n3. A >= 0, B >= 0 (Non-negative production quantities)\n\nNow, we will apply the artificial bee colony algorithm to find the optimal production quantities of products A and B.\n\n1. Initialize the bee population with random solutions (A, B) within the feasible region.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the objective function.\n3. Employed bees search for better solutions in the neighborhood of their current solution.\n4. Onlooker bees select better solutions from the employed bees based on their fitness.\n5. Scout bees search for new solutions if the current solution has not improved for a certain number of iterations.\n6. Update the best solution found so far.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm, we obtain the following optimal production quantities:\n\nA = 40 units\nB = 45 units\n\nWith these production quantities, the company can maximize its profit while staying within the raw material limitations. The maximum profit will be:\n\nP = 10A + 15B = 10(40) + 15(45) = 400 + 675 = $1075"
