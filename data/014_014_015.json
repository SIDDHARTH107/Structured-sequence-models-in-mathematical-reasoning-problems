    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH IS FUN\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is replaced by I in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   C R Y P T\n   O A B D E\n   F G H I K\n   L M N S U\n   V W X Z Q\n\n2. Break the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an X between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an X at the end.\n\n   MA TH IS FU NX\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair encryption rules:\n\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if needed).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrap around if needed).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row and in the column of the other letter.\n\n4. Encrypt the digraphs:\n\n   MA -> YD\n   TH -> LS\n   IS -> KB\n   FU -> OG\n   NX -> ZA\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message:\n\n   YDLSKBOGZA"
