    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring is 0.05. If a company produces 1000 units of that product, what is the probability that at least 50 units will have that particular defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (defective products) in n trials (total products)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (defect) on a single trial (0.05)\n- n is the total number of trials (1000)\n- k is the number of successes (defective products) we are interested in\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 50 defective products, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for 50 to 1000 defective products. However, calculating this directly would be time-consuming. Instead, we can find the probability of the complementary event (less than 50 defective products) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we need to find the probability of 0 to 49 defective products and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X >= 50) = 1 - P(X < 50) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] for k = 0 to 49\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for 0 to 49 defective products using the binomial probability formula:\n\nΣ[P(X = k)] = Σ[C(1000, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 49\n\nThis calculation can be done using statistical software or a calculator with a built-in binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF). Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X < 50) ≈ 0.8164\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 50 defective products:\n\nP(X >= 50) = 1 - P(X < 50) = 1 - 0.8164 ≈ 0.1836\n\nSo, the probability that at least 50 units will have that particular defect is approximately 0.1836 or 18.36%."
