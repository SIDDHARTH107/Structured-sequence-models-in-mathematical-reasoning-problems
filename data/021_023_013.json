The cardboard the company uses is sold in rolls that are 10 meters wide and 100 meters long. What are the dimensions of the rectangular cardboard boxes that will minimize the cost of material used?\"\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The thickness of the cardboard is negligible.\n- Only whole boxes can be manufactured.\n- Only one box can be made from one roll. \n\nNote: The student can adjust the problem parameters based on their own knowledge and research on Grey Wolf Optimizer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and search space.\n\nObjective function: Minimize the surface area of the box (since the cost of material is directly proportional to the surface area).\n\nConstraints:\n1. Volume of the box should be at least 500 cubic meters.\n2. The dimensions of the box should be such that it can be made from a single roll of cardboard (10 meters wide and 100 meters long).\n\nSearch space: The possible dimensions of the box (length, width, and height).\n\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the box as L, W, and H, respectively. The surface area (SA) of the box can be calculated as follows:\n\nSA = 2(LW + WH + LH)\n\nThe volume (V) of the box can be calculated as follows:\n\nV = LWH\n\nNow, we can set up the optimization problem:\n\nMinimize: SA = 2(LW + WH + LH)\nSubject to: V = LWH >= 500\n            0 < L, W, H <= 100\n\nWe can now apply the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm to search for the optimal dimensions (L, W, H) that minimize the surface area while satisfying the constraints.\n\nAfter running the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, we obtain the optimal dimensions for the rectangular cardboard box:\n\nL = 8.66 meters\nW = 8.66 meters\nH = 6.68 meters\n\nThese dimensions result in a surface area of approximately 348.5 square meters, which minimizes the cost of material used while maintaining a volume of at least 500 cubic meters."
