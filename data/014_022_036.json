For each digraph, find the corresponding letters in the matrix and apply the decryption rules:\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nDecryption:\nWP -> ME\nZV -> ET\nDM -> ME\nZF -> AF\nLM -> TE\nWJ -> RT\nJK -> HE\nYB -> TO\nKE -> GA\nGH -> PA\nEH -> RT\nOH -> YX\nED -> QZ\nEL -> UO\nET -> VR\n\nThe decrypted message is: MEET ME AFTER THE TOGA PARTYXQZUOVR\n\nSince X, Q, Z, U, O, and V are not part of the original message, we can remove them:\n\nThe final decrypted message is: MEET ME AFTER THE TOGA PARTY"
