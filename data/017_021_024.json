    "message_1": "Consider a group of order 48. Let G be a non-abelian group of order 48. Determine whether G is isomorphic to cyclic group C48, alternating group A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. If it is isomorphic to any one of these groups, provide a justification for your answer.",
    "message_2": "First, we can rule out G being isomorphic to the cyclic group C48, since G is given to be non-abelian and C48 is an abelian group.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of G being isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4. The group A4 × C4 has order 12 × 4 = 48, so it has the correct order. However, A4 × C4 is also an abelian group, since the direct product of two abelian groups is abelian. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\nSo, we are left with the possibility that G is isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. Since G is non-abelian and has order 48, it must be isomorphic to one of these 14 groups. We cannot determine which specific group G is isomorphic to without more information, but we can conclude that G is isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48."
