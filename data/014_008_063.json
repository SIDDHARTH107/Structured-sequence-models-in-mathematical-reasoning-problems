    "message_2": "AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric block cipher that processes data in 128-bit blocks. Since each bit can have two possible values (0 or 1), there are 2^128 possible permutations of a 128-bit block. \n\nTo calculate the number of permutations, simply compute:\n\n2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456\n\nSo, there are 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible permutations of a 128-bit block that can be generated using AES block cipher."
