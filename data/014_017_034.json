    "message_1": "In frequency analysis, the frequency distribution for a certain language is usually used to crack a substitution cipher. Suppose the frequency distribution for English is: E=12.70%, T=9.06%, A=8.17%, O=7.51%, I=6.97%, N=6.75%, S=6.33%, H=6.09%, R=5.99%, D=4.25%, L=4.03%, U=2.76%, C=2.78%, M=2.41%, W=2.36%, F=2.23%, G=2.02%, Y=1.97%, P=1.93%, B=1.49%, V=0.98%, K=0.77%, J=0.15%, X=0.15%, Q=0.10%, Z=0.07%. If a cryptanalyst finds that the most frequent ciphertext letter in a sample is \"X\", what is the most likely plaintext letter that it represents?",
    "message_2": "The most likely plaintext letter that \"X\" represents is \"E\" since \"E\" has the highest frequency in the English language at 12.70%. In a substitution cipher, the most frequent ciphertext letter often corresponds to the most frequent plaintext letter."
