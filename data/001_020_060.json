    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |3x - 2| + 5, we first need to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found by setting the expression inside the absolute value equal to zero.\n\n3x - 2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n3x = 2\nx = 2/3\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging the x-value back into the equation:\n\ny = |3(2/3) - 2| + 5\ny = |2 - 2| + 5\ny = |0| + 5\ny = 0 + 5\ny = 5\n\nSo, the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |3x - 2| + 5 is (2/3, 5)."
