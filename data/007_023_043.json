    "message_1": "A cryptographic hash function H(x) takes an input x and outputs a fixed-length string of bits. The function needs to have the property that it is difficult to find two inputs x and y such that H(x) = H(y). \n\nSuppose that H(x) is a hash function that takes 16-bit inputs and has the property that for any given output, there are at most two input values that hash to that output. How many different possible outputs does H(x) have?",
    "message_2": "Since H(x) takes 16-bit inputs, there are a total of 2^16 = 65,536 possible input values. Given that for any output, there are at most two input values that hash to that output, we can find the number of different possible outputs by dividing the total number of input values by the maximum number of inputs per output.\n\nSo, the number of different possible outputs is:\n\n65,536 (total input values) / 2 (inputs per output) = 32,768\n\nTherefore, H(x) has 32,768 different possible outputs."
