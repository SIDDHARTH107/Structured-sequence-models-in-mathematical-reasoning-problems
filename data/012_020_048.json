    "message_2": "The Petersen graph is a well-known graph in graph theory, with 10 vertices and 15 edges. It is a highly symmetric graph, which makes its automorphism group quite interesting.\n\nAn automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nThe Petersen graph can be represented as the complement of the line graph of K5 (the complete graph on 5 vertices). It can also be represented as the Kneser graph KG(5, 2), which is the graph whose vertices are the 2-element subsets of a 5-element set, with two vertices being adjacent if and only if their corresponding subsets are disjoint.\n\nThe automorphism group of the Petersen graph is isomorphic to the symmetric group S5, which has order 120. This is because the automorphisms of the Petersen graph correspond to the permutations of the 5-element set used to construct the Kneser graph KG(5, 2).\n\nTo see this, consider the action of the symmetric group S5 on the 2-element subsets of a 5-element set. Each permutation of the 5-element set induces a permutation of the 2-element subsets, and this action preserves adjacency in the Kneser graph. Conversely, any automorphism of the Kneser graph corresponds to a permutation of the 5-element set, since the automorphism must permute the disjoint pairs of 2-element subsets that form the vertices of the graph.\n\nThus, the automorphism group of the Petersen graph is isomorphic to S5, and has order 120."
