    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. The profit earned from selling one unit of product A is $10 and from selling one unit of product B is $12. The production of product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time while production of product B requires 1 hour of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The company has 30 labor hours and 24 machine hours available. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function, P(x, y) = 10x + 12y.\n\nThe constraints are given by the labor and machine hours available:\n\nLabor constraint: 2x + y ≤ 30\nMachine constraint: x + 2y ≤ 24\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y ≤ -2x + 30\n2. Machine constraint: y ≤ -0.5x + 12\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities, including x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. The vertices of the feasible region are:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 12)\nC: (12, 6)\nD: (15, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\nP(B) = 10(0) + 12(12) = $144\nP(C) = 10(12) + 12(6) = $192\nP(D) = 10(15) + 12(0) = $150\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, where the company produces 12 units of product A and 6 units of product B. The maximum profit is $192."
