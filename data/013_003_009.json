    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 has a sum of $10 and offers Player 2 a split. If Player 2 accepts, they both get their respective shares. If Player 2 rejects the offer, both players get nothing. Find the minimum offer Player 1 must make for Player 2 to accept the split.",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum offer Player 1 must make for Player 2 to accept the split depends on the rationality and preferences of Player 2. If Player 2 is purely rational and prefers any amount of money over nothing, then the minimum offer Player 1 can make is $0.01, as this is still better than receiving nothing. However, if Player 2 has preferences for fairness or other factors, the minimum acceptable offer may be higher. It's important to note that the minimum offer may vary between individuals and their preferences."
