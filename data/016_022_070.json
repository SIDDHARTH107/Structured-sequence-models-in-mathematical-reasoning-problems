    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid construction follows a pattern where the number of black squares at each stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of black squares at stage n = 1 + 3 * (Number of black squares at stage n-1)\n\nLet's calculate the number of black squares for each stage up to the 5th stage:\n\nStage 1: 1 black square (given)\n\nStage 2: 1 + 3 * (1) = 1 + 3 = 4 black squares\n\nStage 3: 1 + 3 * (4) = 1 + 12 = 13 black squares\n\nStage 4: 1 + 3 * (13) = 1 + 39 = 40 black squares\n\nStage 5: 1 + 3 * (40) = 1 + 120 = 121 black squares\n\nSo, there are 121 black squares in the 5th stage of the Sierpinski pyramid construction."
