    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinct colorings of an object is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry of the object.\n\nThe cube has 24 symmetries: 6 for each face, and 3 for each vertex. We will consider the number of colorings fixed by each type of symmetry.\n\n1. Identity (no rotation): All 6 faces can be colored independently, so there are 4^6 = 4096 colorings fixed by this symmetry.\n\n2. 90-degree rotation around a face: There are 3 pairs of opposite faces. Each pair must have the same color, so there are 4 choices for each pair, giving 4^3 = 64 colorings fixed by this symmetry. There are 6 such rotations.\n\n3. 180-degree rotation around a face: Each pair of opposite faces must have the same color, so there are 4^3 = 64 colorings fixed by this symmetry. There are 3 such rotations.\n\n4. 120-degree rotation around a vertex: The three faces meeting at the vertex must have different colors, so there are 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 ways to color them. The other three faces must have the same color, so there are 4 - 3 = 1 choice for their color. Thus, there are 24 colorings fixed by this symmetry. There are 8 such rotations.\n\n5. 180-degree rotation around an edge: The two faces adjacent to the edge must have the same color, so there are 4 choices for their color. The other two pairs of opposite faces must have the same color, so there are 4 * 3 = 12 choices for their colors. Thus, there are 4 * 12 = 48 colorings fixed by this symmetry. There are 6 such rotations.\n\nNow we can apply Burnside's Lemma:\n\nNumber of distinct colorings = (1 * 4096 + 6 * 64 + 3 * 64 + 8 * 24 + 6 * 48) / 24 = (4096 + 384 + 192 + 192 + 288) / 24 = 5152 / 24 = 214.67\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we round up to 215. Therefore, there are 215 distinct ways to color the faces of the cube using exactly four colors."
