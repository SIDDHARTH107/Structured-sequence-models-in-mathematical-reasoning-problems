    "message_1": "If a set A contains 4 elements, what is the size of its power set and how does this compare to the size of set A itself?",
    "message_2": "The size of a power set is determined by the number of subsets a set has, including the empty set and the set itself. For a set A with n elements, the size of its power set is 2^n.\n\nIn this case, set A contains 4 elements, so the size of its power set is 2^4, which equals 16.\n\nComparing the size of the power set to the size of set A itself, we see that the power set is significantly larger. Set A has 4 elements, while its power set has 16 elements."
