    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a math student related to the subtopic Moral Hazard in Game Theory:\n\nJohn is running a car insurance company. He has two types of customers: Safe Drivers (S) and Reckless Drivers (R). The probability of a Safe Driver getting into an accident is 20%, while the probability of a Reckless Driver getting into an accident is 50%. The average cost of an accident for a Safe Driver is $3000, and for a Reckless Driver is $5000. John wants to set the premium policy for his customers to maximize his profit. He has two options: \n\nOption 1: Set the same premium for both Safe and Reckless Drivers\nOption 2: Set different premiums for both Safe and Reckless Drivers\n\nAssuming that the customers will only buy insurance if the premium is less than or equal to the expected cost of an accident. Determine the premium for each option, and advise John on which option he should choose in order to maximize his profit.",
    "message_2": "Option 1: Set the same premium for both Safe and Reckless Drivers\n\nTo find the premium that both Safe and Reckless Drivers are willing to pay, we need to find the expected cost of an accident for each type of driver.\n\nExpected cost for Safe Drivers (S) = Probability of accident * Average cost of accident\nExpected cost for S = 0.2 * $3000 = $600\n\nExpected cost for Reckless Drivers (R) = Probability of accident * Average cost of accident\nExpected cost for R = 0.5 * $5000 = $2500\n\nSince both types of drivers will only buy insurance if the premium is less than or equal to their expected cost, John should set the premium at the lower expected cost, which is $600.\n\nOption 2: Set different premiums for both Safe and Reckless Drivers\n\nIn this case, John can set the premium for each type of driver equal to their expected cost of an accident.\n\nPremium for Safe Drivers = $600\nPremium for Reckless Drivers = $2500\n\nNow, let's compare the profits for each option.\n\nOption 1: Profit = Premium * (Number of Safe Drivers + Number of Reckless Drivers)\nAssuming there are equal numbers of Safe and Reckless Drivers, the profit would be:\nProfit = $600 * (S + R)\n\nOption 2: Profit = (Premium for Safe Drivers * Number of Safe Drivers) + (Premium for Reckless Drivers * Number of Reckless Drivers)\nAssuming there are equal numbers of Safe and Reckless Drivers, the profit would be:\nProfit = ($600 * S) + ($2500 * R)\n\nSince the premium for Reckless Drivers is significantly higher in Option 2, John would make more profit by setting different premiums for both Safe and Reckless Drivers. Therefore, John should choose Option 2 to maximize his profit."
