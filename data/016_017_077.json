    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that starts with a single line segment and iteratively adds new segments, each half the length of the previous segments. After the 10th iteration, the total length of the curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal length = initial length * (1 - (1/2)^n) / (1 - 1/2)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit (the length of each line segment of the initial triangular shape). After 10 iterations, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nTotal length = 1 * (1 - (1/2)^10) / (1 - 1/2)\nTotal length = 1 * (1 - 1/1024) / (1/2)\nTotal length = 1 * (1023/1024) / (1/2)\nTotal length = (1023/1024) * 2\nTotal length = 2046/1024\n\nThe total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 10th iteration is approximately 1.998 units."
