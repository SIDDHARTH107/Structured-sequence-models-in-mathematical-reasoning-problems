    "message_2": "To find the dimensions of the triangular plot that yield the maximum possible area with a fixed perimeter, we can use the concept of an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle has all its sides equal and has the maximum area among all triangles with the same perimeter.\n\nGiven the fixed perimeter of 150 meters, we can divide it by 3 to find the length of each side of the equilateral triangle:\n\n150 meters / 3 = 50 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the triangular plot that yield the maximum possible area are 50 meters, 50 meters, and 50 meters."
