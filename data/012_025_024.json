    "message_2": "It is not possible to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph consisting of 7 vertices and 10 edges such that each vertex has degree 2.\n\nProof:\n\nA graph with 7 vertices and each vertex having degree 2 must have a total of 7 * 2 = 14 edges. However, the given graph has only 10 edges, which means it is not a regular graph of degree 2.\n\nIn a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges, there must be at least one vertex with a degree greater than 2. Let's assume there is a Hamiltonian cycle in this graph. A Hamiltonian cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, which means that each vertex in the cycle must have a degree of 2 (one edge entering and one edge leaving the vertex).\n\nHowever, we have already established that there must be at least one vertex with a degree greater than 2 in the graph. This contradicts the requirement for a Hamiltonian cycle, as all vertices in the cycle must have a degree of 2.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph consisting of 7 vertices and 10 edges such that each vertex has degree 2."
