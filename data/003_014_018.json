The lowest point of the Ferris wheel is located 2 meters above ground level. \n\nAt what height above ground level is a passenger at 2.5 minutes into the ride if he/she starts at the lowest point? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the radius of the Ferris wheel. Since the diameter is 50 meters, the radius is half of that:\n\nradius = diameter / 2\nradius = 50 / 2\nradius = 25 meters\n\nNext, we need to find out how far along the ride the passenger is at 2.5 minutes. Since the Ferris wheel takes 4 minutes to make one full revolution, we can find the proportion of the ride completed at 2.5 minutes:\n\nproportion = time_elapsed / time_for_full_revolution\nproportion = 2.5 / 4\nproportion = 0.625\n\nNow, we need to find the angle in radians corresponding to this proportion of the ride. Since one full revolution is 2π radians, we can find the angle by multiplying the proportion by 2π:\n\nangle = proportion * 2π\nangle = 0.625 * 2π\nangle ≈ 3.927 radians\n\nNow we can use the angle to find the height above ground level. Since the passenger starts at the lowest point, we can use the sine function to find the height. The sine function gives us the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the hypotenuse (radius) in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the height above the lowest point of the Ferris wheel, and the hypotenuse is the radius of the Ferris wheel.\n\nheight_above_lowest_point = radius * sin(angle)\nheight_above_lowest_point = 25 * sin(3.927)\nheight_above_lowest_point ≈ 24.71 meters\n\nFinally, we need to add the height of the lowest point above ground level (2 meters) to find the total height above ground level:\n\ntotal_height = height_above_lowest_point + height_of_lowest_point\ntotal_height = 24.71 + 2\ntotal_height ≈ 26.71 meters\n\nSo, the passenger is approximately 26.71 meters above ground level at 2.5 minutes into the ride."
