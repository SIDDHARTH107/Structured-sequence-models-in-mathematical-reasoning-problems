    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 24x + 1, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 - 24x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x - 24\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 6x - 24 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first divide by 3 to simplify:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 8 = 0\n\nNow, we can try to factor the equation:\n\n(x - 4)(x + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 4 = 0 => x = 4\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 24x + 1 are x = 4 and x = -2."
