    "message_1": "A message needs to be digitally signed using the RSA algorithm. The prime numbers used in the algorithm are p=17 and q=23, and the public key exponent is e=7. The message to be signed has the numerical value of 123. Find the digital signature to be sent along with the message.",
    "message_2": "To find the digital signature using the RSA algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Compute the private key exponent d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1\n4. Compute the digital signature S = M^d % n, where M is the numerical value of the message\n\nStep 1: Compute n = p * q\nn = 17 * 23 = 391\n\nStep 2: Compute φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nφ(n) = (17-1) * (23-1) = 16 * 22 = 352\n\nStep 3: Compute the private key exponent d\nWe need to find a value for d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1.\nIn our case, e = 7 and φ(n) = 352. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse.\n\nAfter applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get d = 151.\n\nStep 4: Compute the digital signature S\nS = M^d % n\nS = 123^151 % 391\nS = 266\n\nSo, the digital signature to be sent along with the message is 266."
