    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the curve after n iterations as P(n). After the first iteration, the perimeter doubles, so P(1) = 2 * 4 = 8.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the perimeter increases by a factor of 2^(1/2). Therefore, the perimeter after eight iterations can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(8) = P(1) * (2^(1/2))^7\nP(8) = 8 * (2^(7/2))\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can rewrite 2^(7/2) as (2^7)^(1/2):\n\nP(8) = 8 * (128)^(1/2)\nP(8) = 8 * √128\nP(8) = 8 * 8√2 (since √128 = 8√2)\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after eight iterations is:\n\nP(8) = 64√2."
