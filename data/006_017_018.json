    "message_1": "What is the probability of at least 3 accidents occurring on a particular road per month, if the average number of accidents on the road is 2 per month, and the standard deviation is 1.5?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the normal distribution as an approximation to the Poisson distribution since the standard deviation is given. The Poisson distribution is typically used for modeling the number of events (in this case, accidents) in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score for 3 accidents per month. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the number of accidents, μ is the mean (average) number of accidents, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 3, μ = 2, and σ = 1.5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (3 - 2) / 1.5 = 1 / 1.5 ≈ 0.67\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of having a z-score greater than 0.67, which represents the probability of having at least 3 accidents per month. We can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the area to the right of the z-score.\n\nUsing a z-table or an online calculator, we find that the area to the right of z = 0.67 is approximately 0.2514.\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least 3 accidents occurring on the road per month is approximately 25.14%."
