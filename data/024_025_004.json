    "message_2": "To compute the Chern classes of the tangent bundle T(X), we will use the adjunction formula. The adjunction formula relates the Chern classes of the tangent bundle of a hypersurface in a projective space to the Chern classes of the ambient projective space.\n\nLet X be a complex projective plane curve defined by the homogeneous equation F(X, Y, Z) = X²Z + Y³ + Z⁴ = 0. This curve is embedded in the complex projective plane P². The tangent bundle of P² is given by T(P²) = O(1)⊕O(1)⊕O(1), where O(1) denotes the Serre twisting sheaf.\n\nThe first Chern class of T(P²) is given by c₁(T(P²)) = c₁(O(1)) + c₁(O(1)) + c₁(O(1)) = 3H, where H is the hyperplane class.\n\nNow, let's consider the normal bundle N(X) of X in P². Since X is a hypersurface in P², we have N(X) = O(d), where d is the degree of the curve. In our case, the degree d is 4, as the highest total degree of the monomials in the defining equation is 4. Thus, N(X) = O(4).\n\nThe first Chern class of N(X) is given by c₁(N(X)) = c₁(O(4)) = 4H.\n\nNow, we can apply the adjunction formula, which states that:\n\nT(X) = T(P²)|_X ⊗ N(X)^*\n\nwhere | denotes the restriction to X, and * denotes the dual bundle.\n\nTaking Chern classes, we get:\n\nc(T(X)) = c(T(P²)|_X) * c(N(X)^*)\n\nNow, since the Chern class of a dual bundle is the inverse of the original bundle's Chern class, we have:\n\nc(N(X)^*) = 1/c(N(X)) = 1/(1 + 4H) = 1 - 4H + 16H² - 64H³ + ...\n\nNow, we can compute the Chern classes of T(X) using the Whitney product formula:\n\nc(T(X)) = c(T(P²)|_X) * c(N(X)^*) = (1 + 3H) * (1 - 4H + 16H² - 64H³ + ...)\n\nExpanding the product, we get:\n\nc(T(X)) = 1 - H + 9H² - 28H³ + ...\n\nThus, the first Chern class of T(X) is c₁(T(X)) = -H, and the second Chern class is c₂(T(X)) = 9H²."
