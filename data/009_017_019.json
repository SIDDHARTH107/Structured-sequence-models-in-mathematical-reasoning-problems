    "message_2": "To determine the wave's frequency, we can use the relationship between the electric field amplitude (E) and the magnetic field amplitude (B) for an electromagnetic wave:\n\nE = c * B\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nWe are given E = 2.0 V/m and B = 0.05 T. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n2.0 V/m = (3 × 10^8 m/s) * 0.05 T\n\nNow, we can solve for the frequency (f) using the relationship between the speed of light (c), frequency (f), and wavelength (λ):\n\nc = f * λ\n\nWe know that c = 3 × 10^8 m/s and E = c * B, so:\n\n2.0 V/m = f * λ * 0.05 T\n\nNow we can solve for the frequency (f):\n\nf = (2.0 V/m) / (0.05 T * λ)\n\nWe also know that the speed of light (c) is equal to the product of the frequency (f) and wavelength (λ):\n\n3 × 10^8 m/s = f * λ\n\nNow we can solve for the wavelength (λ):\n\nλ = (3 × 10^8 m/s) / f\n\nSubstituting this expression for λ back into the equation for f:\n\nf = (2.0 V/m) / (0.05 T * (3 × 10^8 m/s) / f)\n\nMultiplying both sides by f and simplifying:\n\nf^2 = (2.0 V/m) / (0.05 T) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nf^2 = 4 × 10^16 Hz^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nf = 2 × 10^8 Hz\n\nNow that we have the frequency, we can find the wavelength (λ):\n\nλ = (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (2 × 10^8 Hz) = 1.5 m\n\nFinally, we can find the amplitude of the wave's electric potential (V) using the equation:\n\nV = E * λ\n\nV = (2.0 V/m) * (1.5 m) = 3.0 V\n\nSo, the wave's frequency is 2 × 10^8 Hz, its wavelength is 1.5 m, and the amplitude of its electric potential is 3.0 V."
