    "message_1": "A company has 10 employees who want to form two committees. Each committee must have at least two members, and no employee can be on both committees. In how many ways can the committees be formed?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the method of complementary counting. We will first count the total number of ways to divide the 10 employees into two groups without the restriction that each committee must have at least two members. Then, we will subtract the number of ways that violate the restriction (i.e., one committee has less than two members).\n\nThere are 10 employees, and each employee has 2 choices: either join the first committee or the second committee. So, there are 2^10 = 1024 ways to divide the employees into two groups without any restrictions.\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways that violate the restriction. There are two cases:\n\n1. One committee has 0 members, and the other committee has all 10 members. There are 2 ways for this to happen (either the first committee has 0 members or the second committee has 0 members).\n\n2. One committee has 1 member, and the other committee has 9 members. There are 10 ways to choose the employee who will be in the smaller committee, and 2 ways to decide which committee that employee will be in. So, there are 10 * 2 = 20 ways for this to happen.\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 20 = 22 ways that violate the restriction.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to form the two committees with at least two members each is 1024 - 22 = 1002."
