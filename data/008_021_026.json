    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can first try to simplify the system by eliminating one of the variables. We can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. Therefore, we can eliminate the second equation from the system, as it does not provide any new information.\n\nNow we have the simplified system:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 5\n2x + 3y - z = 3\n\nWe can subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(2x + 3y - z) - (2x + 3y - z) = 5 - 3\n0 = 2\n\nThis result, 0 = 2, is a contradiction, which means that the given system of linear equations has no solution. This is consistent with the fact that the coefficient matrix of the system is singular, as singular matrices are associated with systems that have either no solution or infinitely many solutions. In this case, the system has no solution."
