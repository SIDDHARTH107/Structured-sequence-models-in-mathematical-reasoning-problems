    "message_1": "A shipping company has to deliver packages to 7 different cities using 5 trucks. Each truck can carry up to 5 packages. What is the minimum number of trucks needed to deliver all the packages?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of packages to be delivered to each city as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P7. Since there are 7 cities and each truck can carry up to 5 packages, the total number of packages to be delivered is 7 * 5 = 35 packages.\n\nNow, let's determine the minimum number of trucks needed to deliver all the packages. Since each truck can carry up to 5 packages, we can divide the total number of packages by the capacity of each truck:\n\n35 packages / 5 packages per truck = 7 trucks\n\nHowever, since the company only has 5 trucks available, the minimum number of trucks needed to deliver all the packages is 5 trucks."
