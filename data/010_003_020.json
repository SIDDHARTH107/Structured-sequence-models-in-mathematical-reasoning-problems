    "message_2": "A topological space X is said to be a Hausdorff space (or T2 space) if for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nWithout knowing the specific topology on X, we cannot determine if X is a Hausdorff space or not. However, we can find a topology on X that makes it Hausdorff.\n\nConsider the discrete topology on X, which is defined as the collection of all possible subsets of X. In the discrete topology, every singleton set {x} is an open set for each x ∈ X.\n\nNow, let x and y be two distinct points in X. We can choose open sets U = {x} and V = {y}. Since x ≠ y, U and V are disjoint, and x ∈ U, y ∈ V. Therefore, X is a Hausdorff space under the discrete topology."
