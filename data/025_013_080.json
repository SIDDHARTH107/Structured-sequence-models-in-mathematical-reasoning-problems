    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through P and Q, we first find the slope of the line:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (2 - 1) / (1 - 0) = 1\n\nSince the slope is 1 and the line passes through P(0, 1), we can write the equation of the line as:\n\ny = x + 1\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection of this line with the curve C. To do this, we substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the curve:\n\n(x + 1)^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + 2x + 1 = x^3 + 2x + 1\n\nx^3 - x^2 = 0\n\nx^2(x - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible x-values for the intersection points: x = 0 and x = 1. However, we already know that P and Q are the intersection points with x = 0 and x = 1, respectively. So, we are looking for a third intersection point R.\n\nSince the curve C is a cubic curve, it must intersect the line at three points (counting multiplicity). Since we already have two intersection points, there must be a third intersection point with the same x-value as one of the existing points, but a different y-value. \n\nLet's consider the case x = 0. The equation of the curve C becomes:\n\ny^2 = (0)^3 + 2(0) + 1\n\ny^2 = 1\n\ny = Â±1\n\nWe already have the point P(0, 1), so the third intersection point R must have coordinates (0, -1).\n\nNow, we calculate the algebraic degree of the point R on C. Since R has the same x-value as P, but a different y-value, it is a point of multiplicity 1 on the curve. Therefore, the algebraic degree of R on C is 1."
