(Assume the center of the ferris wheel is at ground level and ignore any external factors such as wind or drag)",
    "message_2": "The velocity of a point on the Ferris wheel is greatest at the top and bottom of the wheel, as these points are farthest from the center and have the highest tangential speed.\n\nTo find the velocity, we first need to find the angular velocity (ω) of the Ferris wheel. Since it rotates at 2 revolutions per minute, we can convert this to radians per second:\n\n1 revolution = 2π radians\n2 revolutions = 4π radians\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n\nAngular velocity (ω) = (4π radians) / (60 seconds) = (2π/30) radians/second\n\nNow, we can find the velocity (v) of a point on the Ferris wheel using the formula:\n\nv = ω * r\n\nwhere r is the radius of the Ferris wheel. Since the diameter is 40 meters, the radius is 20 meters.\n\nv = (2π/30) * 20 = (2π * 20) / 30 = (40π) / 30 = (4π) / 3 meters/second\n\nSo, the greatest velocity of a point on the Ferris wheel is (4π) / 3 meters/second, which occurs at the top and bottom of the wheel."
