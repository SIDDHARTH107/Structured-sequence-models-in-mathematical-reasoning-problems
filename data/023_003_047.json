    "message_2": "To find the solution u(x, t) at t = 0.1, we first need to solve the differential equation for An(t):\n\nAn'(t) + (nπ)^2An(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation, which has the general solution:\n\nAn(t) = Ce^(-(nπ)^2t)\n\nNow we need to find the constant C using the initial condition An(0) = 4/(nπ)^3 [2 - (-1)^n]:\n\nAn(0) = Ce^(-(nπ)^2 * 0) = C\n\nSo, C = 4/(nπ)^3 [2 - (-1)^n]\n\nNow we have the expression for An(t):\n\nAn(t) = (4/(nπ)^3 [2 - (-1)^n])e^(-(nπ)^2t)\n\nWe can now compute the first five non-zero coefficients A1(t), A2(t), A3(t), A4(t), A5(t) at t = 0.1:\n\nA1(0.1) = (4/(π)^3)e^(-(π)^2 * 0.1)\nA2(0.1) = 0 (since n is even)\nA3(0.1) = (4/(3π)^3)e^(-(3π)^2 * 0.1)\nA4(0.1) = 0 (since n is even)\nA5(0.1) = (4/(5π)^3)e^(-(5π)^2 * 0.1)\n\nNow we can plug these coefficients into the expansion for u(x, t):\n\nu(x, 0.1) = A1(0.1)sin(πx) + A2(0.1)sin(2πx) + A3(0.1)sin(3πx) + A4(0.1)sin(4πx) + A5(0.1)sin(5πx)\n\nSince A2(0.1) and A4(0.1) are zero, the expansion simplifies to:\n\nu(x, 0.1) = A1(0.1)sin(πx) + A3(0.1)sin(3πx) + A5(0.1)sin(5πx)\n\nThis is the solution u(x, t) at t = 0.1 using the first five non-zero coefficients."
