    "message_1": "Given the set of all possible inputs to a program, if it is possible to determine whether the program will eventually halt or run forever for each input using a finite amount of time, we say that the program is computable. \n\nNow, consider a program that takes in a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order. Is it possible to determine, using only a finite amount of time, whether this program will halt or run forever for every possible list of numbers as input?",
    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to determine whether a sorting program will halt or run forever for every possible list of numbers as input using only a finite amount of time. This is because sorting algorithms are deterministic and have a well-defined behavior for any given input.\n\nFor any sorting algorithm, the maximum number of steps it takes to sort a list of numbers is a function of the size of the list. For example, bubble sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. Other sorting algorithms, like merge sort or quick sort, have a worst-case time complexity of O(n*log(n)). In any case, the number of steps is finite for any finite list of numbers.\n\nSince the number of steps is finite for any finite list of numbers, we can determine whether the sorting program will halt or run forever for every possible list of numbers as input using only a finite amount of time. Therefore, the sorting program is computable."
