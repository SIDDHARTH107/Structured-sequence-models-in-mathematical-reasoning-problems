    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the intersection curve of V1 and V2, we first need to find the points of intersection. To do this, we will solve the system of equations formed by V1 and V2.\n\nV1: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\nV2: x^3 - 3xyz + z^3 = 0\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives of V1 and V2 with respect to x, y, and z.\n\n∂V1/∂x = 2x\n∂V1/∂y = 2y\n∂V1/∂z = 2z\n\n∂V2/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂V2/∂y = -3xz\n∂V2/∂z = -3xy + 3z^2\n\nA singular point occurs when the gradients of both V1 and V2 are linearly dependent, i.e., when the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is zero. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ = | ∂V1/∂x  ∂V1/∂y  ∂V1/∂z |\n      | ∂V2/∂x  ∂V2/∂y  ∂V2/∂z |\n\nJ = |  2x     2y     2z  |\n      | 3x^2-3yz  -3xz  -3xy+3z^2 |\n\nNow, let's compute the determinant of J:\n\ndet(J) = (2x)((-3xz)(-3xy+3z^2) - (-3xz)(-3xy)) - (2y)((3x^2-3yz)(-3xy+3z^2) - (-3xz)(3x^2-3yz)) + (2z)((3x^2-3yz)(-3xz) - (-3xz)(3x^2-3yz))\n\nAfter simplifying, we get:\n\ndet(J) = 18x^2y^2z^2\n\nA singular point occurs when det(J) = 0. Since x, y, and z are all squared, the only solution is when at least one of x, y, or z is zero. We can analyze these cases separately:\n\n1. x = 0: From V1, we have y^2 + z^2 = 1. From V2, we have -3y^2z^2 + z^3 = 0. Solving this system, we find no singular points.\n\n2. y = 0: From V1, we have x^2 + z^2 = 1. From V2, we have x^3 + z^3 = 0. Solving this system, we find no singular points.\n\n3. z = 0: From V1, we have x^2 + y^2 = 1. From V2, we have x^3 = 0, which implies x = 0. Thus, we have the point (0, ±1, 0) on the intersection curve.\n\nNow, we need to determine the type of each singular point. To do this, we will look at the Hessian matrix H of V2, which is the matrix of second-order partial derivatives:\n\nH = | ∂²V2/∂x²  ∂²V2/∂x∂y  ∂²V2/∂x∂z |\n      | ∂²V2/∂y∂x  ∂²V2/∂y²  ∂²V2/∂y∂z |\n      | ∂²V2/∂z∂x  ∂²V2/∂z∂y  ∂²V2/∂z² |\n\nH = | 6x   -3z   -3y |\n      | -3z  0    -3x |\n      | -3y  -3x  6z  |\n\nNow, let's evaluate H at the singular points (0, ±1, 0):\n\nH(0, ±1, 0) = | 0  0  -3 |\n                       | 0  0  0  |\n                       | -3  0  0  |\n\nThe determinant of H(0, ±1, 0) is zero, which means we cannot determine the type of the singular points using the Hessian matrix alone. However, since the intersection curve is a circle in the yz-plane, the singular points (0, ±1, 0) are nodes."
