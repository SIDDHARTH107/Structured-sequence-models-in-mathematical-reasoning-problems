Find the feedback controller $u(t)$ such that the output $y(t)$ settles at $y_{ss}=5$ in the shortest amount of time possible while avoiding overshoots.",
    "message_2": "To design a feedback controller that settles the output $y(t)$ to $y_{ss} = 5$ in the shortest amount of time possible while avoiding overshoots, we can use a proportional controller. The proportional controller has the form:\n\n$$u(t) = K_p (y_{ss} - y(t))$$\n\nwhere $K_p$ is the proportional gain. To find the appropriate value for $K_p$, we can analyze the closed-loop system.\n\nSubstitute the controller into the differential equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = K_p (5 - y(t))$$\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\\frac{dy}{dt} + (2 + K_p)y = 5K_p$$\n\nThe characteristic equation of the closed-loop system is:\n\n$$s^2 + 3s + (2 + K_p) = 0$$\n\nTo avoid overshoots, we need the closed-loop system to have no complex roots, which means the discriminant of the characteristic equation must be non-negative:\n\n$$\\Delta = (3)^2 - 4(2 + K_p) \\geq 0$$\n\nSolving for $K_p$:\n\n$$K_p \\leq \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nTo achieve the fastest settling time, we choose the largest possible value for $K_p$:\n\n$$K_p = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThus, the feedback controller is:\n\n$$u(t) = \\frac{1}{4} (5 - y(t))$$"
