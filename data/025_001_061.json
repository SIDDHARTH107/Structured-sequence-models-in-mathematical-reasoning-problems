    "message_1": "Consider the two algebraic curves in the plane given by the equations $xy-2=0$ and $x^2 + y^2 - 4=0$. Using Bezout's theorem, determine the number of intersection points of these two curves.",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product of the degrees of the curves, provided that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are finite.\n\nThe first curve, $xy - 2 = 0$, is a degree 2 curve (since the highest degree term is $xy$, which has degree 1 in both $x$ and $y$).\n\nThe second curve, $x^2 + y^2 - 4 = 0$, is also a degree 2 curve (since the highest degree terms are $x^2$ and $y^2$, both of which have degree 2).\n\nSince both curves are degree 2 and they have no common components, Bezout's theorem tells us that the number of intersection points, counted with multiplicity, is the product of the degrees of the curves, which is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 intersection points of these two curves, counted with multiplicity."
