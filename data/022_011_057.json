    "message_1": "Consider the function $f(z) = \\frac{z+2}{z^2-1}$. Determine the number and location of its zeros and poles.",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz + 2 = 0\nz = -2\n\nSo, there is one zero located at z = -2.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two poles located at z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) has one zero at z = -2 and two poles at z = 1 and z = -1."
