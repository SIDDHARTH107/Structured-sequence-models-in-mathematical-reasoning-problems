    "message_2": "To calculate the power spectrum of the returns using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) over a 60-day period, we first need to generate a series of daily returns based on the given mean and standard deviation.\n\nLet's denote the daily returns as R_i, where i ranges from 1 to 60. Since the daily returns follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0.3% and a standard deviation of 1.2%, we can generate the series of returns using these parameters.\n\nNext, we need to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the series of returns. The DFT is defined as:\n\nX_k = Σ (R_i * e^(-2πijk/N)), where i ranges from 0 to N-1, j is the imaginary unit, and N is the number of data points (in this case, N = 60).\n\nAfter calculating the DFT, we can compute the power spectrum, which is the square of the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients:\n\nP_k = |X_k|^2, where k ranges from 0 to N-1.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the power spectrum values for each k and obtain the power spectrum of the returns over the 60-day period. Note that the actual values will depend on the specific daily returns generated based on the given mean and standard deviation."
