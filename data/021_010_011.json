    "message_1": "A company has a production function given by Q = L^(1/3)K^(2/3), where Q is the output level, L is the amount of labor used, and K is the amount of capital used. The total cost (TC) function is given by TC = 2000 + 100L + 500K. Find the combination of labor (L) and capital (K) that minimizes the total cost of producing 64 units of output using Newton's method.",
    "message_2": "To find the combination of labor (L) and capital (K) that minimizes the total cost of producing 64 units of output, we need to use the Lagrange multiplier method. This method is more suitable for this problem than Newton's method, as it deals with optimization problems with constraints.\n\nLet's set up the Lagrange function, where λ is the Lagrange multiplier:\n\nLagrange(L, K, λ) = TC - λ(Q - 64)\nLagrange(L, K, λ) = 2000 + 100L + 500K - λ(L^(1/3)K^(2/3) - 64)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of the Lagrange function with respect to L, K, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂Lagrange/∂L = 100 - λ(1/3)L^(-2/3)K^(2/3) = 0\n∂Lagrange/∂K = 500 - λ(2/3)L^(1/3)K^(-1/3) = 0\n∂Lagrange/∂λ = L^(1/3)K^(2/3) - 64 = 0\n\nNow, we have a system of three equations with three unknowns (L, K, and λ). To solve this system, we can first eliminate λ from the first two equations:\n\n100 = λ(1/3)L^(-2/3)K^(2/3)\n500 = λ(2/3)L^(1/3)K^(-1/3)\n\nDivide the first equation by 100 and the second equation by 500:\n\n1 = λ(1/3)L^(-2/3)K^(2/3)\n1 = λ(2/3)L^(1/3)K^(-1/3)\n\nNow, divide the first equation by the second equation:\n\n1 = (L^(-1)K)/2\n\nRearrange to get:\n\nL = 2K\n\nNow, substitute this back into the third equation from the Lagrange function:\n\n(2K)^(1/3)K^(2/3) - 64 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n2^(1/3)K - 64 = 0\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK = 64 / 2^(1/3)\nK ≈ 39.48\n\nNow, substitute K back into the L = 2K equation:\n\nL = 2 * 39.48\nL ≈ 78.96\n\nSo, the combination of labor (L) and capital (K) that minimizes the total cost of producing 64 units of output is approximately L ≈ 78.96 and K ≈ 39.48."
