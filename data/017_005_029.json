    "message_2": "To find all possible groups of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide 27 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27. However, since n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we must have n_3 = 1. This means that there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, which we will denote by P.\n\nSince P is the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, it must be a normal subgroup of G. Furthermore, since the order of P is 3^3 = 27, we have that P = G. Thus, G is a 3-group, meaning that every element in G has order a power of 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G. There are three possibilities:\n\n1. G is cyclic, i.e., G is isomorphic to Z_27, the cyclic group of order 27.\n2. G is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n3. G has a more complicated structure.\n\nWe will show that the third possibility does not occur.\n\nSuppose G is not cyclic. Then, G must have an element of order 9, say x. Let H = ⟨x⟩ be the subgroup generated by x. Since the order of x is 9, the order of H is also 9. Now, let y be an element in G that is not in H. Since G is not cyclic, the order of y must be 3. Let K = ⟨y⟩ be the subgroup generated by y. Since the order of y is 3, the order of K is also 3.\n\nNow, consider the product HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. Since H and K are both normal subgroups of G (as they have prime index), we have |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K|. Since H and K are both subgroups of G, their intersection must be non-empty. However, since the orders of H and K are coprime, their intersection must be the identity element, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}. Thus, |HK| = |H||K| = 9 * 3 = 27.\n\nSince HK is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, we have HK = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K. Since H is a cyclic group of order 9 and K is a cyclic group of order 3, we have shown that G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 27 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
