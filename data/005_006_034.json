    "message_1": "Suppose the heights of a group of students have a mean of 65 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If another student is randomly selected from the same population, what is the probability that the height of the selected student will be between 62 inches and 68 inches? (Assuming that the population is normally distributed due to the central limit theorem.)",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the height of the selected student will be between 62 inches and 68 inches, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the z-scores for 62 inches and 68 inches.\n\nFor 62 inches:\nz1 = (62 - 65) / 3 = -3 / 3 = -1\n\nFor 68 inches:\nz2 = (68 - 65) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1\n\nNow, we'll use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(z1) = P(z = -1) ≈ 0.1587\nP(z2) = P(z = 1) ≈ 0.8413\n\nTo find the probability that the height of the selected student will be between 62 inches and 68 inches, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(62 < X < 68) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that the height of the selected student will be between 62 inches and 68 inches is approximately 0.6826 or 68.26%."
