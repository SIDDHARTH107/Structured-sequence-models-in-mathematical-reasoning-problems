    "message_1": "Let G be a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges, and H be a graph with 7 vertices and 8 edges. Determine whether G and H are isomorphic or not. If yes, provide an isomorphism between them. If no, why not?",
    "message_2": "G and H cannot be isomorphic because they have a different number of edges. G has 10 edges, while H has 8 edges. Isomorphic graphs must have the same number of vertices and edges, as well as the same structure. Since G and H have a different number of edges, they cannot be isomorphic."
