    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 8 over the interval [-3, 2], we can use the properties of convex functions. A quadratic function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is:\nf'(x) = 2x + 6\n\nThe second derivative of f(x) is:\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive (2 > 0), the function is convex.\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for x:\n2x + 6 = 0\n2x = -6\nx = -3\n\nSince there is only one critical point and the function is convex, this critical point corresponds to the minimum value of the function. However, we need to check the endpoints of the interval as well to make sure we have the global minimum over the interval [-3, 2].\n\nf(-3) = (-3)^2 + 6(-3) + 8 = 9 - 18 + 8 = -1\nf(2) = (2)^2 + 6(2) + 8 = 4 + 12 + 8 = 24\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) over the interval [-3, 2] is -1, which occurs at x = -3."
