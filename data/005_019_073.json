    "message_1": "A person plays a game where they get a score of 1, 2 or 3 points on each turn with equal probabilities. The score they get on each turn depends only on their previous score, such that if their current score is s, then they will get a score of s-1, s or s+1 on the next turn with probabilities 1/3 each. If the person has a score of 2 or higher, they win the game. What is the probability that the person wins the game if they start with a score of 0?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of winning the game when the person's current score is s as P(s). We are asked to find P(0).\n\nSince the person's next score depends only on their current score, we can use the following recursive formula:\n\nP(s) = 1/3 * P(s-1) + 1/3 * P(s) + 1/3 * P(s+1)\n\nWe know that if the person has a score of 2 or higher, they win the game, so P(2) = 1 and P(3) = 1.\n\nNow, we can use the recursive formula to find P(1):\n\nP(1) = 1/3 * P(0) + 1/3 * P(1) + 1/3 * P(2)\nP(1) = 1/3 * P(0) + 1/3 * P(1) + 1/3 * 1\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for P(0):\n\nP(0) = 3 * (P(1) - 1/3 * P(1) - 1/3)\n\nNow, we can use the recursive formula again to find P(0):\n\nP(0) = 1/3 * P(-1) + 1/3 * P(0) + 1/3 * P(1)\n\nSince the person cannot have a negative score, we can assume P(-1) = 0:\n\nP(0) = 1/3 * 0 + 1/3 * P(0) + 1/3 * P(1)\n\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n\n2/3 * P(0) = 1/3 * P(1)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for P(0) from the equation for P(1):\n\n2/3 * P(0) = 1/3 * (3 * (P(1) - 1/3 * P(1) - 1/3))\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2 * P(0) = P(1) - 1/3 * P(1) - 1/3\n\nNow, we can substitute P(1) from the equation for P(0):\n\n2 * P(0) = 3 * P(0) - 1/3 * (3 * P(0) - 1) - 1/3\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2 * P(0) = 3 * P(0) - P(0) + 1/3 - 1/3\n\n1 * P(0) = 2 * P(0) - P(0)\n\nP(0) = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability that the person wins the game if they start with a score of 0 is 1/3."
