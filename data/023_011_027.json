    "message_2": "The given audio signal is already in the form of a sum of sinusoidal components. Therefore, we don't need to use the Fourier Transform to find the amplitude and frequency of the three sinusoidal components. We can directly read the amplitude and frequency from the given equation.\n\nThe equation is: `s(t) = 3sin(2π(100)t) + 2sin(2π(500)t) + 5sin(2π(1000)t)`\n\nThere are three sinusoidal components in this equation:\n\n1. The first component has an amplitude of 3 and a frequency of 100 Hz. This is represented by the term `3sin(2π(100)t)`.\n\n2. The second component has an amplitude of 2 and a frequency of 500 Hz. This is represented by the term `2sin(2π(500)t)`.\n\n3. The third component has an amplitude of 5 and a frequency of 1000 Hz. This is represented by the term `5sin(2π(1000)t)`.\n\nSo, the amplitude and frequency of the three sinusoidal components are:\n\n1. Amplitude: 3, Frequency: 100 Hz\n2. Amplitude: 2, Frequency: 500 Hz\n3. Amplitude: 5, Frequency: 1000 Hz"
