    "message_2": "First, let's find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups of G. The order of G is 18 = 2 * 3^2. By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 divides 2 (the index of 3 in the factorization of 18)\n2. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nThe only possibility for n_3 is 1, which means there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say P_3, of order 9. Since it is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2. By Sylow's Theorems, n_2 satisfies:\n\n1. n_2 divides 9 (the index of 2 in the factorization of 18)\n2. n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\nThe possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G, say P_2, of order 2. Since it is unique, it is normal in G. In this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 2 and a normal subgroup of order 9. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and by the product formula, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which are cyclic groups of order 2 and 9, respectively. Thus, G is isomorphic to C2 x C9, which is isomorphic to C18, the cyclic group of order 18.\n\nIf n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups of G, and none of them are normal in G. In this case, G cannot be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and it cannot be a cyclic group. Therefore, G must be the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nTo determine which case we are in, we can use the fact that a group of order 18 must have an element of order 9 (by Cauchy's Theorem, since 9 divides 18). If G has an element of order 18, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C18. If G has an element of order 9 but no element of order 18, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6. If G has no elements of order 9 or 18, then G is the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6, depending on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and the orders of its elements."
