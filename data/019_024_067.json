    "message_2": "Since John is a human and all humans are mortal, we can abductively conclude that John is mortal. To provide a numerical justification, let's represent this information using a syllogism:\n\n1. All humans are mortal (100% of humans are mortal).\n2. John is a human (100% certainty that John is a human).\n\nUsing these premises, we can deduce that John is mortal with 100% certainty, as he falls under the category of humans, which are all mortal."
