    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of regions (faces) in the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 8 and E = 12. We want to find out if there exists a value for F that satisfies Euler's formula.\n\nBefore we do that, let's check if the graph satisfies the necessary condition for planarity using Kuratowski's theorem. According to this theorem, a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nFor a graph to be a subdivision of K5, it must have at least 5 vertices and 10 edges. For a graph to be a subdivision of K3,3, it must have at least 6 vertices and 9 edges. Our graph has 8 vertices and 12 edges, so it is possible that it could be a subdivision of either K5 or K3,3. However, we don't have enough information to determine if it actually contains such a subgraph, so we cannot conclude that the graph is non-planar based on Kuratowski's theorem alone.\n\nNow let's go back to Euler's formula. We want to find a value for F that satisfies:\n\n8 - 12 + F = 2\n\nSolving for F, we get:\n\nF = 6\n\nSo, if the graph is planar, it must have 6 regions. However, we still don't know if the graph is actually planar or not. To determine this, we can use the inequality for planar graphs, which states that for any simple, connected, planar graph with at least 3 vertices:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, this inequality becomes:\n\n12 ≤ 3 * 8 - 6\n\n12 ≤ 18\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible for the graph to be planar. Therefore, we can conclude that the graph is planar and has a maximum of 6 regions."
