    "message_1": "In a group of six people, what is the minimum number of connections (between two people) needed to guarantee that there are at least three people who are mutual friends or at least three people who are mutual strangers?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one person in the group, say person A. There are 5 other people in the group, so person A can have connections with each of them. These connections can be classified into two categories: friends and strangers.\n\nNow, let's apply the Pigeonhole Principle. We have 5 connections and 2 categories (friends and strangers), so when we distribute the connections into the categories, at least one category must have at least ⌈5/2⌉ = 3 connections.\n\nLet's consider the two cases:\n\n1. Person A has at least 3 friends: If any of these 3 friends are friends with each other, then we have a group of 3 mutual friends (A and the two friends). If none of these 3 friends are friends with each other, then they are all strangers to each other, and we have a group of 3 mutual strangers (the 3 friends).\n\n2. Person A has at least 3 strangers: If any of these 3 strangers are strangers to each other, then we have a group of 3 mutual strangers (A and the two strangers). If none of these 3 strangers are strangers to each other, then they are all friends with each other, and we have a group of 3 mutual friends (the 3 strangers).\n\nIn both cases, we are guaranteed to have at least three people who are mutual friends or at least three people who are mutual strangers. Therefore, the minimum number of connections needed is 5."
