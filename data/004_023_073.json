    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x between x = 0 and x = 2, we need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the given interval.\n\nThe difference between the two functions is (2x - x^2). Now, we will integrate this difference with respect to x from 0 to 2:\n\nâˆ«(2x - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\nF(x) = x^2 - (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we evaluate F(x) at the limits of integration:\n\nF(2) = (2^2) - (1/3)(2^3) = 4 - (8/3) = 4/3\nF(0) = (0^2) - (1/3)(0^3) = 0\n\nNow, we subtract F(0) from F(2) to find the area enclosed by the curves:\n\nArea = F(2) - F(0) = 4/3 - 0 = 4/3\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x between x = 0 and x = 2 is 4/3 square units."
