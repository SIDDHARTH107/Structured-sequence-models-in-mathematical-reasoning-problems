    "message_1": "Suppose set A has 10 elements and set B has 15 elements. If set C is defined as C = (A ∆ B) and set D is defined as D = (B ∆ A), what is the cardinality of the symmetric difference between set C and set D?",
    "message_2": "The symmetric difference between two sets A and B, denoted as A ∆ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection: A ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nSince the symmetric difference operation is commutative, meaning that A ∆ B = B ∆ A, we can see that set C and set D are actually equal. Therefore, the symmetric difference between set C and set D is the empty set, as there are no elements that are in one set but not the other.\n\nThe cardinality of the symmetric difference between set C and set D is 0, as there are no elements in the symmetric difference."
