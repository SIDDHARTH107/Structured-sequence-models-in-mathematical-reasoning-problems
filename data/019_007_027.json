    "message_1": "Given the following rules of a non-monotonic logic system:\n\n1) If A is true, then B is also true.\n2) If B is true, then C is also true.\n3) If C is true, then D is also true.\n4) If E is true, then D is not true.\n\nBased on these rules, determine whether each of the following statements is true, false, or uncertain:\n\n1) If A is true, then C is true.\n2) If A is true, then D is true.\n3) If E is true, then A is not true.\n\nPlease provide your answer in clear justification with all details.",
    "message_2": "1) If A is true, then C is true.\n\nJustification: According to rule 1, if A is true, then B is also true. Now, using rule 2, if B is true, then C is also true. So, if A is true, it follows that C is true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n2) If A is true, then D is true.\n\nJustification: Following the same logic as in statement 1, if A is true, then B is true (rule 1), and if B is true, then C is true (rule 2). Now, using rule 3, if C is true, then D is also true. So, if A is true, it follows that D is true. However, since this is a non-monotonic logic system, the presence of rule 4 introduces uncertainty. If E is true, then D is not true, which means that we cannot definitively say that D is true if A is true. Therefore, this statement is uncertain.\n\n3) If E is true, then A is not true.\n\nJustification: There is no direct relationship between E and A in the given rules. Rule 4 only states that if E is true, then D is not true. It does not provide any information about the truth value of A. Therefore, this statement is uncertain."
