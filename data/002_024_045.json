    "message_1": "A trapezium has one parallel side of 10 cm, another parallel side of 16 cm, and the height is 8 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call these sides a and b. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of these sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the base of the two right triangles formed by drawing a perpendicular line from the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side. This base will be the same for both triangles.\n\nThe difference in length between the two parallel sides is 16 cm - 10 cm = 6 cm. Since there are two right triangles, the base of each triangle will be half of this difference, which is 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of sides a and b.\n\nFor side a:\na^2 = base^2 + height^2\na^2 = 3^2 + 8^2\na^2 = 9 + 64\na^2 = 73\na = √73\n\nFor side b:\nb^2 = base^2 + height^2\nb^2 = 3^2 + 8^2\nb^2 = 9 + 64\nb^2 = 73\nb = √73\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all four sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium.\n\nPerimeter = shorter parallel side + longer parallel side + side a + side b\nPerimeter = 10 cm + 16 cm + √73 cm + √73 cm\nPerimeter = 26 cm + 2√73 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 26 cm + 2√73 cm."
