    "message_2": "To compute the Fourier transform F(ω) of the given sinusoidal signal f(t) = 5 sin(2πt + π/4), we first need to rewrite the sine function in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nsin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix)) / (2i)\n\nSo, f(t) = 5((e^(i(2πt + π/4)) - e^(-i(2πt + π/4))) / (2i))\n\nNow, we can compute the Fourier transform F(ω) using the following formula:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the entire time domain.\n\nFor our signal, we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[5((e^(i(2πt + π/4)) - e^(-i(2πt + π/4))) / (2i)) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n\nLet's separate the two terms in the integral:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2i) ∫[(e^(i(2πt + π/4)) * e^(-iωt)) - (e^(-i(2πt + π/4)) * e^(-iωt))] dt\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2i) ∫[(e^(i(2πt + π/4 - ωt))) - (e^(-i(2πt + π/4 + ωt)))] dt\n\nSince the signal has a frequency range of -10 Hz to 10 Hz, the integral will be non-zero only when ω = 2π (the frequency of the sinusoidal signal). For all other values of ω, the integral will be zero.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform F(ω) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2i) ∫[(e^(i(2πt + π/4 - 2πt))) - (e^(-i(2πt + π/4 + 2πt)))] dt\n\nF(ω) = (5/2i) ∫[(e^(iπ/4)) - (e^(-i(4πt + π/4)))] dt\n\nThe second term in the integral is a periodic function with a frequency of 4π, and its integral over the entire time domain will be zero. Therefore, we only need to compute the integral of the first term:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2i) ∫(e^(iπ/4)) dt\n\nSince e^(iπ/4) is a constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2i) (e^(iπ/4)) ∫dt\n\nThe integral of dt is simply t, and we need to evaluate it over the entire time domain:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2i) (e^(iπ/4)) t\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, this result is only valid for ω = 2π. For all other values of ω, F(ω) = 0.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform F(ω) of the given sinusoidal signal is:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2i) (e^(iπ/4)) t for ω = 2π\nF(ω) = 0 for all other values of ω"
