The market demand for the product is Q = 300 - P, where Q is total quantity sold and P is the price. The cost function for each firm is C(Q) = 20Q, where C(Q) is the total cost of producing Q units of output. Firm 1 is the leader in the market and decides on its output level first, after which Firm 2 decides on its output level. Determine the Stackelberg Equilibrium in terms of price and quantity.",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg Equilibrium, we need to first find the reaction function for Firm 2, which is the best response of Firm 2 to the output level chosen by Firm 1. Then, we will find the optimal output level for Firm 1, considering Firm 2's reaction function.\n\n1. Find the inverse demand function: P = 300 - Q\n2. Find the total revenue for each firm: TR = P * Q = (300 - Q) * Q\n3. Find the profit function for each firm: π = TR - C(Q) = (300 - Q) * Q - 20Q\n4. Find the reaction function for Firm 2: To do this, we need to find the best response of Firm 2 to the output level chosen by Firm 1. Let Q1 be the output of Firm 1 and Q2 be the output of Firm 2. The total quantity in the market is Q = Q1 + Q2.\n\nThe profit function for Firm 2 is: π2 = (300 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2 - 20Q2\nTake the first derivative of π2 with respect to Q2 and set it to zero to find the optimal output level for Firm 2:\n\ndπ2/dQ2 = 300 - 2Q2 - Q1 - 20 = 0\nQ2 = (280 - Q1) / 2\n\n5. Find the optimal output level for Firm 1: Now, we need to find the optimal output level for Firm 1, considering Firm 2's reaction function. The profit function for Firm 1 is:\n\nπ1 = (300 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q1 - 20Q1\n\nSubstitute the reaction function of Firm 2 (Q2 = (280 - Q1) / 2) into the profit function of Firm 1:\n\nπ1 = (300 - (Q1 + (280 - Q1) / 2)) * Q1 - 20Q1\n\nSimplify and take the first derivative of π1 with respect to Q1, then set it to zero to find the optimal output level for Firm 1:\n\ndπ1/dQ1 = 140 - 2Q1 - 20 = 0\nQ1 = 60\n\n6. Find the optimal output level for Firm 2 using the reaction function:\n\nQ2 = (280 - Q1) / 2 = (280 - 60) / 2 = 110\n\n7. Find the equilibrium price using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 300 - (Q1 + Q2) = 300 - (60 + 110) = 130\n\nThe Stackelberg Equilibrium is a price of 130 and output levels of 60 for Firm 1 and 110 for Firm 2."
