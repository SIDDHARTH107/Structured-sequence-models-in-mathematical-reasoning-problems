    "message_2": "To find the number of students who study Math or Physics, but not both, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe total number of students studying Math is 20, and the total number of students studying Physics is 15. However, since 10 students study both Math and Physics, they are counted twice in the sum of 20 + 15. To account for this, we need to subtract the number of students studying both subjects once.\n\nSo, the number of students studying Math or Physics, but not both, is:\n\n(20 students studying Math) + (15 students studying Physics) - (10 students studying both) = 20 + 15 - 10 = 25 students."
