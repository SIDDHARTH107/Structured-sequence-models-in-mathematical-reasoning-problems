    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to partition a set of 5 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets, so we need to find the value of S(5, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(5, 3), we need to know the values of S(4, 3), S(4, 2), S(3, 3), and S(3, 2). We can compute these using the same formula:\n\nS(3, 2) = 2 * S(2, 2) + S(2, 1)\nS(3, 3) = 3 * S(2, 3) + S(2, 2)\n\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\n\nWe also need the base cases:\n\nS(n, 1) = 1 for all n\nS(n, n) = 1 for all n\nS(n, 0) = 0 for all n > 0\n\nNow we can compute the values:\n\nS(2, 1) = 1\nS(2, 2) = 1\n\nS(3, 2) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3\nS(3, 3) = 3 * 0 + 1 = 1\n\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\n\nFinally, we can find S(5, 3):\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25\n\nSo there are 25 ways to partition a set of 5 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
