    "message_2": "First, let's prove the theorem:\n\nLet X be a path-connected topological space, and let f and g be two continuous maps from S^1 to X such that f(1) = g(1). We want to show that f and g are homotopic with respect to their basepoint f(1) if and only if their induced maps on the fundamental group of X at f(1) are equal, i.e., π_1(f(1); X) = π_1(g(1); X).\n\n(⇒) Suppose f and g are homotopic with respect to their basepoint f(1). Then there exists a homotopy H: S^1 × [0, 1] → X such that H(x, 0) = f(x), H(x, 1) = g(x), and H(1, t) = f(1) for all x in S^1 and t in [0, 1]. Since H is continuous, the induced maps on the fundamental group are equal, i.e., π_1(f(1); X) = π_1(g(1); X).\n\n(⇐) Suppose π_1(f(1); X) = π_1(g(1); X). Since X is path-connected, the fundamental group π_1(X, f(1)) is the same for all basepoints in X. Let x_0 be a point in S^1, and let α: [0, 1] → S^1 be a loop based at x_0. Then f * α and g * α are loops in X based at f(1) = g(1). Since the induced maps on the fundamental group are equal, there exists a homotopy H: S^1 × [0, 1] → X such that H(x, 0) = f(x), H(x, 1) = g(x), and H(1, t) = f(1) for all x in S^1 and t in [0, 1]. Thus, f and g are homotopic with respect to their basepoint f(1).\n\nNow, let's use this theorem to prove the given statement:\n\nSuppose X is a topological space and f, g: S^1 → X are two continuous maps from the unit circle S^1 to X such that f(1) = g(1). If X is a path-connected space, and π_1(X, f(1)) = Z_2, then we want to show that f and g are homotopic with respect to their basepoint f(1).\n\nSince π_1(X, f(1)) = Z_2, the fundamental group has only two elements, say [e] and [a], where [e] is the identity element. Let x_0 be a point in S^1, and let α: [0, 1] → S^1 be a loop based at x_0. Then f * α and g * α are loops in X based at f(1) = g(1). Since the fundamental group has only two elements, either [f * α] = [g * α] or [f * α] = [g * α] * [a].\n\nIn the first case, the induced maps on the fundamental group are equal, so by the theorem, f and g are homotopic with respect to their basepoint f(1).\n\nIn the second case, [f * α] * [a] = [g * α]. Since [a] has order 2, [a] * [a] = [e]. Thus, [f * α] * [a] * [a] = [g * α] * [a], which implies [f * α] = [g * α]. Again, the induced maps on the fundamental group are equal, so by the theorem, f and g are homotopic with respect to their basepoint f(1).\n\nIn both cases, f and g are homotopic with respect to their basepoint f(1), as desired."
