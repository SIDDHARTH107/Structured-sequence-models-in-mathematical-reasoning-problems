    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs, and the average number of defective bulbs produced in a day is 4. What is the probability that the factory will produce 6 defective bulbs in a day, assuming that the number of defective bulbs follows a Poisson distribution?",
    "message_2": "The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, defective bulbs) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (defective bulbs), k is the specific number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 6 defective bulbs), λ (lambda) is the average number of events (defective bulbs) in the given interval (in this case, 4 defective bulbs per day), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability that the factory will produce 6 defective bulbs in a day, so we will plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = (e^(-4) * 4^6) / 6!\n\nFirst, calculate e^(-4):\ne^(-4) ≈ 0.01832\n\nNext, calculate 4^6:\n4^6 = 4096\n\nNow, calculate 6! (6 factorial):\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\nFinally, plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = (0.01832 * 4096) / 720 ≈ 0.1042\n\nSo, the probability that the factory will produce 6 defective bulbs in a day is approximately 0.1042 or 10.42%."
