    "message_1": "A class of 20 students took a math test, and their scores were as follows: \n\n60, 62, 68, 72, 74, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 88, 90, 92, 92, 94, 96, 98, 98, 100.\n\nOne student claims that their score was recorded incorrectly and is an outlier. \n\nUsing the five-number summary and the interquartile range, determine whether the claim is true or false.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we first need to find the five-number summary and the interquartile range (IQR).\n\nThe five-number summary consists of the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (second quartile, Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum.\n\nMinimum: 60\nMaximum: 100\n\nTo find the quartiles, we first find the median:\nThere are 20 students, so the median is the average of the 10th and 11th scores:\n(80 + 82) / 2 = 81\nMedian (Q2): 81\n\nNow we find Q1, which is the median of the lower half of the data (not including the median if the number of data points is odd):\nThere are 10 scores in the lower half, so Q1 is the average of the 5th and 6th scores:\n(74 + 74) / 2 = 74\nQ1: 74\n\nNext, we find Q3, which is the median of the upper half of the data (not including the median if the number of data points is odd):\nThere are 10 scores in the upper half, so Q3 is the average of the 15th and 16th scores:\n(92 + 94) / 2 = 93\nQ3: 93\n\nNow we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 93 - 74 = 19\n\nTo determine if a score is an outlier, we use the 1.5 * IQR rule:\nLower boundary: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 74 - 1.5 * 19 = 74 - 28.5 = 45.5\nUpper boundary: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 93 + 1.5 * 19 = 93 + 28.5 = 121.5\n\nNow we can check if any of the scores fall outside these boundaries:\nAll scores are between 45.5 and 121.5, so there are no outliers.\n\nTherefore, the student's claim that their score was recorded incorrectly and is an outlier is false."
