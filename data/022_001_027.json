    "message_2": "First, let's find the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = (1 + z^2)^(-1) to the domain |z| > 1. We can rewrite the function as a partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = (1 + z^2)^(-1) = A/(z - i) + B/(z + i)\n\nwhere A and B are constants. To find A and B, we can multiply both sides by (1 + z^2) and simplify:\n\n1 = A(z + i) + B(z - i)\n\nNow, let's find A and B by substituting z = i and z = -i:\n\nFor z = i:\n1 = A(2i)\nA = 1/(2i) = -i/2\n\nFor z = -i:\n1 = B(-2i)\nB = -1/(2i) = i/2\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of f(z) is:\n\nf(z) = -i/(2(z - i)) + i/(2(z + i))\n\nNow, let's find the pole at z = i. A pole occurs when the denominator of a term goes to zero. In this case, the pole occurs at z = i for the term -i/(2(z - i)). The residue of this pole can be found by multiplying the term by (z - i) and taking the limit as z approaches i:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> i) -i/2\nResidue = -i/2\n\nNow, let's use the analytic continuation to evaluate the real integral:\n\n∫(from -∞ to ∞) f(x) dx = 2πi * (sum of residues)\n\nSince we only have one pole at z = i, the sum of residues is just the residue at that pole:\n\n∫(from -∞ to ∞) f(x) dx = 2πi * (-i/2) = π\n\nSo, the value of the real integral is π."
