    "message_2": "To find the optimal route for the truck to visit all locations and deliver all packages while minimizing the total distance traveled, we can use the nearest neighbor algorithm. \n\n1. Start at location A (since it has the most packages).\n2. Find the nearest location to the current location that has not been visited yet.\n3. Move to the nearest location and mark it as visited.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all locations have been visited.\n5. Return to the starting location (A).\n\nHere's the optimal route using the nearest neighbor algorithm:\n\n1. Start at location A (250 kg of packages).\n2. The nearest location to A is B (10 km away). Move to B and deliver 300 kg of packages.\n3. The nearest location to B is E (20 km away). Move to E and deliver 100 kg of packages.\n4. The nearest location to E is D (10 km away). Move to D and deliver 200 kg of packages.\n5. The nearest location to D is C (30 km away). Move to C and deliver 150 kg of packages.\n6. Return to the starting location A (15 km away).\n\nThe optimal route is A -> B -> E -> D -> C -> A.\n\nThe total distance traveled is 10 + 20 + 10 + 30 + 15 = 85 km."
