    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 for the interval [0, 4], we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 0 to 4.\n\nThe integral of x^2 + 1 with respect to x is:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 1) dx = (1/3)x^3 + x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval [0, 4]:\n\n[(1/3)(4)^3 + 4] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + 0] = (1/3)(64) + 4 = 64/3 + 4 = 64/3 + 12/3 = 76/3\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 for the interval [0, 4] is 76/3 square units."
