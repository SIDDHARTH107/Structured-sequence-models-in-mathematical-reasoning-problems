    "message_2": "Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it counts the number of integers that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 with n.\n\nTo calculate φ(20), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nThe prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5^1. So, the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nφ(20) = 20 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(20) = 20 * (1/2) * (4/5)\nφ(20) = 10 * (4/5)\nφ(20) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function φ(20) is 8."
