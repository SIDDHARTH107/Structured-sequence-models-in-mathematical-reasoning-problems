    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, and then solve for dy/dx.\n\nGiven equation: 2x + 3y = 5\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\nd/dx(2x) + d/dx(3y) = d/dx(5)\n\nUsing the chain rule, d/dx(3y) = 3(dy/dx), since we're differentiating with respect to x, not y.\n\nSo we have:\n2(dx/dx) + 3(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSince dx/dx = 1, the equation becomes:\n2(1) + 3(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we'll solve for dy/dx:\n3(dy/dx) = -2\n(dy/dx) = -2/3\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 1. We'll plug x = 1 into the original equation:\n\n2(1) + 3y = 5\n2 + 3y = 5\n3y = 3\ny = 1\n\nSo when x = 1, y = 1. The derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx) is -2/3, and this value does not depend on the values of x and y in this case. Therefore, the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 1 is -2/3."
