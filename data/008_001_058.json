    "message_2": "To write the system of linear equations in matrix form, we can represent it as AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n4x - y = 2\n\nMatrix A (coefficients) is:\n| 3  2 |\n| 4 -1 |\n\nMatrix X (variables) is:\n| x |\n| y |\n\nMatrix B (constants) is:\n| 7 |\n| 2 |\n\nSo, the matrix form is:\n\n| 3  2 | | x |   | 7 |\n| 4 -1 | | y | = | 2 |\n\nNow, we will solve the system of equations using matrix methods. One common method is to find the inverse of matrix A and then multiply it by matrix B to find the values of x and y.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -1) - (2 * 4) = -3 - 8 = -11\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nThe adjugate (adj) of matrix A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = | -1 -2 |\n         | -4  3 |\n\nNow, let's find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-11) * | -1 -2 |\n                  | -4  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 1/11  2/11 |\n         | 4/11 -3/11 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) by matrix B:\n\n| x |   | 1/11  2/11 | | 7 |\n| y | = | 4/11 -3/11 | | 2 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\n| x |   | (1/11 * 7) + (2/11 * 2) |\n| y | = | (4/11 * 7) - (3/11 * 2) |\n\nCalculating the values:\n\n| x |   | 7/11 + 4/11 |\n| y | = | 28/11 - 6/11 |\n\n| x |   | 11/11 |\n| y | = | 22/11 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2"
