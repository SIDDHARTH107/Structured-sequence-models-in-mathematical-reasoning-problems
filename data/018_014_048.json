    "message_2": "First, let's find A×B, which is the Cartesian product of A and B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA×B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A×B, denoted as (A×B)'.\n\n(A×B)' is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that (x, y) is not in A×B. Since we are not given a universal set, we cannot explicitly list the elements of (A×B)'. However, we can still work with the complements of A and B individually.\n\nLet's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B', respectively. Again, since we are not given a universal set, we cannot explicitly list the elements of A' and B'. However, we can still find the Cartesian product of A' and B', denoted as A'×B'.\n\nA'×B' is the set of all ordered pairs (a', b') such that a' is in A' and b' is in B'. We cannot explicitly list the elements of A'×B' since we do not know the elements of A' and B'.\n\nNow, let's verify that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement for these sets. To do this, we need to show that (A×B)' is not equal to A'×B'.\n\nSince we cannot explicitly list the elements of (A×B)', A', B', and A'×B', we cannot directly compare them. However, we can reason about their properties.\n\nThe set (A×B)' contains all ordered pairs (x, y) that are not in A×B. This means that for any (x, y) in (A×B)', either x is not in A or y is not in B.\n\nOn the other hand, the set A'×B' contains all ordered pairs (a', b') such that a' is in A' and b' is in B'. This means that for any (a', b') in A'×B', both a' is not in A and b' is not in B.\n\nSince the conditions for an ordered pair to be in (A×B)' and A'×B' are different, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement for these sets."
