    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm, a longer base of 14 cm and a shorter base of 10 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the two non-parallel sides. Let's call the length of the left side \"a\" and the length of the right side \"b\". We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of these two sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the segment that connects the two bases and is perpendicular to them. Since the height of the trapezium is 8 cm, this segment will also have a length of 8 cm. Now, let's find the horizontal distance between the two bases. The longer base is 14 cm, and the shorter base is 10 cm, so the horizontal distance between them is (14 - 10) / 2 = 2 cm.\n\nNow we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the two non-parallel sides:\n\na^2 = 8^2 + 2^2\na^2 = 64 + 4\na^2 = 68\na = √68 ≈ 8.246\n\nb^2 = 8^2 + 2^2\nb^2 = 64 + 4\nb^2 = 68\nb = √68 ≈ 8.246\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all four sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = 14 cm (longer base) + 10 cm (shorter base) + 8.246 cm (left side) + 8.246 cm (right side)\nPerimeter ≈ 14 + 10 + 8.246 + 8.246\nPerimeter ≈ 40.492 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 40.492 cm."
