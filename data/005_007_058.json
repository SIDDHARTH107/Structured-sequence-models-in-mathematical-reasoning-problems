Calculate the correlation coefficient between the hours studied and the grades earned, and interpret the result. \n\n```\nHours Studied: 5 7 3 2 8 6 1 4 9 10\nGrades Earned: 70 85 65 60 90 80 55 75 95 92\n```",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between the hours studied and the grades earned, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of both the hours studied (X) and the grades earned (Y).\n2. Calculate the deviations from the mean for each value (Xi - X_mean and Yi - Y_mean).\n3. Multiply the deviations for each pair of values and sum them up (Σ[(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean)]).\n4. Calculate the sum of squared deviations for both X and Y (Σ(Xi - X_mean)^2 and Σ(Yi - Y_mean)^2).\n5. Divide the sum of the products of deviations by the square root of the product of the sum of squared deviations.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Mean of hours studied (X_mean) = (5+7+3+2+8+6+1+4+9+10)/10 = 55/10 = 5.5\n   Mean of grades earned (Y_mean) = (70+85+65+60+90+80+55+75+95+92)/10 = 767/10 = 76.7\n\n2. Deviations from the mean for each value:\n   Hours studied: -0.5, 1.5, -2.5, -3.5, 2.5, 0.5, -4.5, -1.5, 3.5, 4.5\n   Grades earned: -6.7, 8.3, -11.7, -16.7, 13.3, 3.3, -21.7, -1.7, 18.3, 15.3\n\n3. Multiply the deviations for each pair of values and sum them up:\n   Σ[(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean)] = (-0.5 * -6.7) + (1.5 * 8.3) + (-2.5 * -11.7) + (-3.5 * -16.7) + (2.5 * 13.3) + (0.5 * 3.3) + (-4.5 * -21.7) + (-1.5 * -1.7) + (3.5 * 18.3) + (4.5 * 15.3) = 3.35 + 12.45 + 29.25 + 58.45 + 33.25 + 1.65 + 97.65 + 2.55 + 64.05 + 68.85 = 371.55\n\n4. Calculate the sum of squared deviations for both X and Y:\n   Σ(Xi - X_mean)^2 = (-0.5)^2 + (1.5)^2 + (-2.5)^2 + (-3.5)^2 + (2.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (-4.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (3.5)^2 + (4.5)^2 = 0.25 + 2.25 + 6.25 + 12.25 + 6.25 + 0.25 + 20.25 + 2.25 + 12.25 + 20.25 = 82.5\n   Σ(Yi - Y_mean)^2 = (-6.7)^2 + (8.3)^2 + (-11.7)^2 + (-16.7)^2 + (13.3)^2 + (3.3)^2 + (-21.7)^2 + (-1.7)^2 + (18.3)^2 + (15.3)^2 = 44.89 + 68.89 + 136.89 + 278.89 + 176.89 + 10.89 + 470.89 + 2.89 + 334.89 + 234.09 = 1960.1\n\n5. Divide the sum of the products of deviations by the square root of the product of the sum of squared deviations:\n   Pearson's r = Σ[(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean)] / √(Σ(Xi - X_mean)^2 * Σ(Yi - Y_mean)^2) = 371.55 / √(82.5 * 1960.1) = 371.55 / √(161682.5) = 371.55 / 402.097 = 0.924\n\nThe correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between the hours studied and the grades earned is approximately 0.924. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the hours studied and the grades earned, meaning that as the number of hours studied increases, the grades earned also tend to increase."
