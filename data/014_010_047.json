    "message_1": "How many possible different substitution ciphers can be created using the alphabet A to Z (26 letters) if each letter can be replaced with any other letter in the alphabet?",
    "message_2": "The number of possible different substitution ciphers using the alphabet A to Z (26 letters) can be calculated using the concept of permutations. In a substitution cipher, each letter can be replaced with any other letter in the alphabet, but no two letters can be replaced with the same letter. This means that we have 26 options for the first letter, 25 options for the second letter, 24 options for the third letter, and so on.\n\nTo find the total number of possible substitution ciphers, we can calculate the number of permutations of 26 items, which is represented as 26! (26 factorial).\n\n26! = 26 × 25 × 24 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000\n\nSo, there are 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possible different substitution ciphers using the alphabet A to Z."
