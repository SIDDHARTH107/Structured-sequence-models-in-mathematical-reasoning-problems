    "message_2": "The method of integrating factors is typically used for linear first-order differential equations, not for nonlinear equations like the one given. However, we can still attempt to solve this equation using a different method, such as separation of variables.\n\nGiven the differential equation:\n\ny' + y^2 = 1\n\nWe can rewrite it as:\n\ny' = 1 - y^2\n\nNow, we can separate the variables:\n\ndy/dt = 1 - y^2\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\ndy/(1 - y^2) = dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫ dy/(1 - y^2) = ∫ dt\n\nTo integrate the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let:\n\n1/(1 - y^2) = A/(1 - y) + B/(1 + y)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1 - y^2), we get:\n\n1 = A(1 + y) + B(1 - y)\n\nComparing the coefficients, we find that A = 1/2 and B = 1/2. So, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫ (1/2)(1/(1 - y) + 1/(1 + y)) dy = ∫ dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n(1/2)(∫ 1/(1 - y) dy + ∫ 1/(1 + y) dy) = ∫ dt\n\n(1/2)(-ln|1 - y| + ln|1 + y|) = t + C\n\nNow, combine the logarithms:\n\nln|1 + y|/|1 - y| = 2t + C'\n\nTo remove the logarithm, take the exponent of both sides:\n\n|(1 + y)/(1 - y)| = e^(2t + C')\n\nSince y(0) = 0, we can find the constant C':\n\n|1/1| = e^(2 * 0 + C')\n\n1 = e^C'\n\nC' = 0\n\nNow, we have:\n\n|(1 + y)/(1 - y)| = e^(2t)\n\nSince the expression inside the absolute value is always positive, we can remove the absolute value:\n\n(1 + y)/(1 - y) = e^(2t)\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n1 + y = e^(2t)(1 - y)\n\n1 + y = e^(2t) - e^(2t)y\n\ny + e^(2t)y = e^(2t) - 1\n\ny(1 + e^(2t)) = e^(2t) - 1\n\ny = (e^(2t) - 1) / (1 + e^(2t))\n\nThis is the solution to the given nonlinear differential equation:\n\ny(t) = (e^(2t) - 1) / (1 + e^(2t))"
