    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard measuring 12 cm by 10 cm needs to be folded to make an open box. What is the maximum volume of the box that can be made?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the volume of the open box, we need to find the optimal value for the length of the square cut from each corner of the cardboard. Let's denote the length of the square cut as x.\n\nWhen the squares are cut out, the dimensions of the box will be:\nLength: 12 - 2x\nWidth: 10 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume of the box (V) can be calculated as the product of its length, width, and height:\nV = (12 - 2x)(10 - 2x)x\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\nV = 4x^3 - 44x^2 + 120x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative of V with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\ndV/dx = 12x^2 - 88x + 120\n\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic equation for x:\n12x^2 - 88x + 120 = 0\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 12, b = -88, and c = 120. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nx = (88 ± √((-88)^2 - 4(12)(120))) / (2 * 12)\n\nx = (88 ± √(7744 - 5760)) / 24\nx = (88 ± √1984) / 24\nx = (88 ± 44.56) / 24\n\nWe get two possible values for x:\nx1 = (88 + 44.56) / 24 ≈ 5.523\nx2 = (88 - 44.56) / 24 ≈ 1.81\n\nSince the length of the square cut cannot be more than half of the smaller side of the cardboard (10 cm), we can discard the first value (x1) as it is not feasible. Therefore, the optimal value for x is approximately 1.81 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum volume of the box using the dimensions:\nLength: 12 - 2(1.81) ≈ 8.38 cm\nWidth: 10 - 2(1.81) ≈ 6.38 cm\nHeight: 1.81 cm\n\nThe maximum volume of the box is:\nV = 8.38 * 6.38 * 1.81 ≈ 91.52 cm³"
