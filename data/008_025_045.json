    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 6 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n2x + 6y - 8z = 12\n\nSecond equation - (First equation * 2):\n(2x - 4y + 8z) - (2x + 6y - 8z) = -10 - 12\n-10y = -22\ny = 22/10 = 11/5\n\nFirst equation * 6:\n6x + 18y - 24z = 36\n\nThird equation - (First equation * 6):\n(6x + 9y - 12z) - (6x + 18y - 24z) = 18 - 36\n-9y + 12z = -18\n-3y + 4z = -6\n\nNow we have:\nx + 3y - 4z = 6\ny = 11/5\n-3y + 4z = -6\n\nNext, we can substitute the value of y into the first and third equations:\n\nx + 3(11/5) - 4z = 6\nx + 33/5 - 4z = 6\n5x + 33 - 20z = 30\n5x - 20z = -3\n\n-3(11/5) + 4z = -6\n-33/5 + 4z = -6\n-33 + 20z = -30\n20z = 3\n\nNow we have:\n5x - 20z = -3\n20z = 3\n\nDivide the second equation by 20:\nz = 3/20\n\nNow substitute the value of z back into the equation for x:\n5x - 20(3/20) = -3\n5x - 3 = -3\n5x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 11/5, and z = 3/20."
