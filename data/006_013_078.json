    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a flood occurring in a certain region in any given year is 0.05. What is the probability that a flood will occur in the region at least once in the next 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. The complementary probability of an event occurring is the probability that the event does not occur. In this case, the complementary probability is the probability that a flood does not occur in any of the next 10 years.\n\nThe probability of a flood not occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the years are independent, the probability of a flood not occurring in any of the next 10 years is the product of the probabilities of a flood not occurring in each of the 10 years:\n\nP(No flood in 10 years) = 0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a flood occurring at least once in the next 10 years by finding the complementary probability of no flood occurring in the next 10 years:\n\nP(At least one flood in 10 years) = 1 - P(No flood in 10 years) ≈ 1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability that a flood will occur in the region at least once in the next 10 years is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
