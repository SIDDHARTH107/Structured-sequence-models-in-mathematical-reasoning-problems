    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the two curves, we need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [1, 2]. Since y = 4x - 1 is greater than y = 3x^2 in the given interval, we will subtract the quadratic function from the linear function.\n\nArea = ∫(4x - 1 - 3x^2) dx from x = 1 to x = 2\n\nNow, we'll integrate the function:\n\n∫(4x - 1 - 3x^2) dx = (2x^2 - x - x^3) + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\n(2(2)^2 - (2) - (2)^3) - (2(1)^2 - (1) - (1)^3) = (2(4) - 2 - 8) - (2 - 1 - 1) = (8 - 2 - 8) - (0) = -2\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we'll take the absolute value of the result:\n\nArea = |-2| = 2 square units\n\nSo, the area bounded by the two curves between x = 1 and x = 2 is 2 square units."
