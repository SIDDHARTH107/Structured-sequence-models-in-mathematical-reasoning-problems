    "message_1": "Suppose two travelers played the Traveler's Dilemma game where they are asked to independently choose a number between 0 and 100. Their rewards are determined by the following formula:\n\nReward = 101 - the smallest number chosen * 2 if they both choose the same number\nReward = 101 - the larger number chosen * 2 if one traveler chooses a larger number than the other\n\nIf the two travelers choose 45 and 52, respectively, what will be their respective rewards in this game?",
    "message_2": "Since one traveler chose 45 and the other chose 52, they did not choose the same number. Therefore, we will use the second formula:\n\nReward = 101 - the larger number chosen * 2\n\nFor the traveler who chose 45, the reward will be:\n\nReward = 101 - 52 * 2\nReward = 101 - 104\nReward = -3\n\nFor the traveler who chose 52, the reward will be:\n\nReward = 101 - 45 * 2\nReward = 101 - 90\nReward = 11\n\nSo, the respective rewards for the two travelers in this game are -3 and 11."
