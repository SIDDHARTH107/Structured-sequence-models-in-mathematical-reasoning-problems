    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 10 cm and radius 5 cm is initially at a uniform temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. At time t=0, the rod is placed in a surrounding medium at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius. Given the thermal diffusivity of the metal as 0.01 cm^2/sec and the specific heat capacity as 0.1 J/(g*K), find the temperature distribution in the rod as a function of time t, at a distance r from the center of the rod. Also, determine the time taken for the center of the rod to reach a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution in the rod as a function of time t and distance r from the center of the rod, we can use the cylindrical coordinate heat conduction equation. For a long cylinder with uniform initial temperature and constant thermal diffusivity, the temperature distribution can be given by the following equation:\n\nT(r, t) = T_initial + 2(T_initial - T_surrounding) / pi * sum(n=1 to infinity) (1 / (2n - 1)) * exp(-alpha * (2n - 1)^2 * pi^2 * t / 4L^2) * J0((2n - 1) * pi * r / 2L)\n\nwhere T_initial is the initial temperature (100 degrees Celsius), T_surrounding is the surrounding temperature (0 degrees Celsius), alpha is the thermal diffusivity (0.01 cm^2/sec), L is the length of the rod (10 cm), and J0 is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n\nTo determine the time taken for the center of the rod to reach a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius, we can set T(0, t) = 50 degrees Celsius and solve for t:\n\n50 = 100 + 2(100 - 0) / pi * sum(n=1 to infinity) (1 / (2n - 1)) * exp(-0.01 * (2n - 1)^2 * pi^2 * t / 400)\n\n0.5 = sum(n=1 to infinity) (1 / (2n - 1)) * exp(-0.01 * (2n - 1)^2 * pi^2 * t / 400)\n\nTo solve for t, we can use a numerical method, such as the bisection method or Newton's method, to find the root of the equation. Using a numerical solver, we find that the time taken for the center of the rod to reach a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius is approximately t â‰ˆ 104.6 seconds."
