    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1 meter has a temperature distribution described by the function T(x) = 100 - x^2, where x is the distance from one end of the rod. The ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature of 200 degrees Celsius. \n\nWhat is the steady-state temperature distribution of the rod? What is the rate of heat transfer through the rod? What is the temperature at a point 0.5 meters from the left end of the rod?",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution of the rod, we need to solve the 1D heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the material. In steady-state, the temperature distribution does not change with time, so ∂T/∂t = 0. Thus, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n0 = ∂²T/∂x²\n\nIntegrating twice with respect to x, we get:\n\nT(x) = C1*x + C2\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = 200 => C2 = 200\nT(1) = 200 => C1 = 0\n\nSo, the steady-state temperature distribution is:\n\nT(x) = 200\n\nThe rate of heat transfer through the rod can be found using Fourier's law of heat conduction:\n\nq = -k * ∂T/∂x\n\nwhere q is the heat transfer rate and k is the thermal conductivity of the material. Since the temperature distribution is constant in the steady-state, ∂T/∂x = 0, and therefore:\n\nq = 0\n\nThe rate of heat transfer through the rod is 0.\n\nFinally, the temperature at a point 0.5 meters from the left end of the rod in the steady-state is:\n\nT(0.5) = 200\n\nThe temperature at that point is 200 degrees Celsius."
