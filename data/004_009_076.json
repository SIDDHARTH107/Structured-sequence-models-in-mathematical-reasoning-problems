    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x^2 + 5x - 6\nv(x) = sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x + 5\nv'(x) = cos(x)\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In other words:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we plug in our expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 5)sin(x) + (x^2 + 5x - 6)cos(x)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 5)sin(x) + (x^2 + 5x - 6)cos(x)"
