    "message_2": "To find the solutions for the equation sin(x) = 1/2 in the interval [0, 2π), we need to find the angles x for which the sine function equals 1/2.\n\nWe know that sin(π/6) = 1/2 and sin(5π/6) = 1/2. These are the two angles in the interval [0, 2π) that have a sine value of 1/2.\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation sin(x) = 1/2 in the interval [0, 2π) are x = π/6 and x = 5π/6."
