    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 3x - 5, we first need to find the x-intercepts, y-intercept, and the vertex of the parabola.\n\n1. X-intercepts:\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x^2 + 3x - 5\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 3, and c = -5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(3) ± √((3)^2 - 4(2)(-5))) / 2(2)\nx = (-3 ± √(9 + 40)) / 4\nx = (-3 ± √49) / 4\nx = (-3 ± 7) / 4\n\nSo, we have two x-intercepts:\n\nx1 = (-3 + 7) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\nx2 = (-3 - 7) / 4 = -10 / 4 = -2.5\n\nThus, the x-intercepts are (1, 0) and (-2.5, 0).\n\n2. Y-intercept:\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 + 3(0) - 5\ny = -5\n\nThus, the y-intercept is (0, -5).\n\n3. Vertex:\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2 and b = 3, so:\n\nx_vertex = -3 / (2 * 2) = -3 / 4\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex:\n\ny_vertex = 2(-3/4)^2 + 3(-3/4) - 5\ny_vertex = 2(9/16) - 9/4 - 5\ny_vertex = 9/8 - 9/4 - 5\ny_vertex = 9/8 - 18/8 - 40/8\ny_vertex = (-49/8)\n\nThus, the vertex of the parabola is (-3/4, -49/8).\n\nNow that we have the x-intercepts, y-intercept, and vertex, we can graph the equation on a coordinate plane. The parabola will open upwards since the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive. The vertex will be the lowest point on the graph, and the parabola will pass through the x-intercepts and y-intercept."
