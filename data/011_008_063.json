    "message_1": "In how many ways can 8 different colored balls be distributed among 4 identical boxes, if each box should receive at least 1 ball?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the stars and bars method. Since there are 4 identical boxes and each box should receive at least 1 ball, we can first place 1 ball in each box. Now, we have 4 balls left to distribute among the 4 boxes.\n\nLet's represent the balls as stars (*) and the dividers between the boxes as bars (|). Since there are 4 boxes, we need 3 dividers. We can arrange the remaining 4 balls and 3 dividers in a row. There are 7 positions in total (4 balls + 3 dividers).\n\nWe can choose any 3 of these 7 positions for the dividers, and the balls will fill the remaining positions. The number of ways to do this is the number of combinations of choosing 3 positions out of 7, which is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * 4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\n\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 ways to distribute the 8 different colored balls among the 4 identical boxes, with each box receiving at least 1 ball."
