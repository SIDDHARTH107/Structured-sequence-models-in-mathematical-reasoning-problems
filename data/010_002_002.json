    "message_2": "To prove that x = y, we will use the triangle inequality and the definition of convergence.\n\nRecall the triangle inequality for a metric space (X, d): for any points a, b, and c in X, we have\n\nd(a, b) ≤ d(a, c) + d(c, b).\n\nNow, let ε > 0 be arbitrary. Since lim_{n->inf} d(x_n, x) = 0, there exists a natural number N1 such that for all n ≥ N1, we have\n\nd(x_n, x) < ε/2.\n\nSimilarly, since lim_{n->inf} d(x_n, y) = 0, there exists a natural number N2 such that for all n ≥ N2, we have\n\nd(x_n, y) < ε/2.\n\nLet N = max(N1, N2). Then, for all n ≥ N, we have both d(x_n, x) < ε/2 and d(x_n, y) < ε/2. Now, we apply the triangle inequality with a = x, b = y, and c = x_n:\n\nd(x, y) ≤ d(x, x_n) + d(x_n, y).\n\nSince n ≥ N, we can substitute the inequalities we found earlier:\n\nd(x, y) ≤ ε/2 + ε/2.\n\nThus, d(x, y) ≤ ε. Since ε > 0 was arbitrary, we must have d(x, y) = 0. In a metric space, the distance between two points is zero if and only if the points are equal. Therefore, x = y."
