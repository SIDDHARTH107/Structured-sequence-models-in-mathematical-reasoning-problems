    "message_1": "Suppose you have six candies of different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, and purple. In how many different ways can you select three candies if you can select more than one candy of the same color?",
    "message_2": "If you can select more than one candy of the same color, it means that there is an unlimited supply of candies for each color. In this case, we can use the \"stars and bars\" method to solve the problem.\n\nWe have 3 candies to select and 6 colors to choose from. We can represent the candies as stars (*) and the colors as dividers (|). For example, if we select 1 red, 1 blue, and 1 green candy, we can represent it as:\n\n*|*|*|||\n\nTo find the total number of ways to select three candies, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the stars and dividers. We have 3 stars and 5 dividers (since there are 6-1=5 spaces between the colors). So, we need to arrange 8 symbols (3 stars and 5 dividers) in total.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 8 symbols is the number of ways to choose 3 positions for the stars (or 5 positions for the dividers) out of 8 positions, which is a combination:\n\nC(8,3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 different ways to select three candies with the possibility of selecting more than one candy of the same color."
