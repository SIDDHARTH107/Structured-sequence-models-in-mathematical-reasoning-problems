    "message_1": "Suppose there is a factory that produces two types of products x and y. The production of product x requires 2 units of raw material 1 and 1 unit of raw material 2. The production of product y requires 1 unit of raw material 1 and 2 units of raw material 2. The factory has 80 units of raw material 1 and 100 units of raw material 2 available for the production. However, the factory has only 50 hours of production time available per day. If the profit for one unit of product x is $5 and for one unit of product y is $7, how many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of units of product x produced as x and the number of units of product y produced as y. We are given the following constraints:\n\n1. Raw material 1 constraint: 2x + y ≤ 80\n2. Raw material 2 constraint: x + 2y ≤ 100\n3. Production time constraint: x + y ≤ 50\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. y ≤ -2x + 80\n2. y ≤ -0.5x + 50\n3. y ≤ -x + 50\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines:\n\nIntersection of 1 and 2:\n-2x + 80 = -0.5x + 50\n-1.5x = -30\nx = 20\ny = -2(20) + 80 = 40\n\nIntersection of 1 and 3:\n-2x + 80 = -x + 50\n-x = -30\nx = 30\ny = -2(30) + 80 = 20\n\nIntersection of 2 and 3:\n-0.5x + 50 = -x + 50\n0.5x = 0\nx = 0\ny = -0.5(0) + 50 = 50\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (20, 40), (30, 20), and (0, 50).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(20, 40) = 5(20) + 7(40) = 100 + 280 = $380\nP(30, 20) = 5(30) + 7(20) = 150 + 140 = $290\nP(0, 50) = 5(0) + 7(50) = 0 + 350 = $350\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20, 40), with a profit of $380. Therefore, the factory should produce 20 units of product x and 40 units of product y to maximize the profit."
