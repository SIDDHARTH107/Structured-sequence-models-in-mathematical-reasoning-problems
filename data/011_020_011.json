    "message_1": "In a school, there are 12 students who want to form a committee consisting of a chairperson and a secretary. How many different committees can be formed if no student can hold both positions?",
    "message_2": "To form a committee, we need to choose a chairperson and a secretary from the 12 students. Since no student can hold both positions, we have 12 choices for the chairperson and 11 choices for the secretary (as the chairperson cannot be the secretary).\n\nTherefore, the number of different committees that can be formed is 12 choices for the chairperson multiplied by 11 choices for the secretary, which is:\n\n12 * 11 = 132\n\nSo, 132 different committees can be formed."
