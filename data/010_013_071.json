It is known that the total Chern class of the bundle is $c(TX)\\cdot (1+a)^n$, where $TX$ denotes the tangent bundle of $X$ and $a$ is the first Chern class of the bundle. If $TX$ has Chern classes $c_1(TX) = 0$ and $c_2(TX) = 3$, and the first Chern class of the vector bundle is $a = 2c_1(TX)$, what is the total Chern class of the vector bundle?",
    "message_2": "Given that $c_1(TX) = 0$ and $a = 2c_1(TX)$, we have $a = 0$. Now, we can compute the total Chern class of the vector bundle using the formula $c(TX) \\cdot (1+a)^n$. Since $a = 0$, we have $(1+a)^n = 1^n = 1$. \n\nThe total Chern class of the tangent bundle $TX$ is given by $c(TX) = 1 + c_1(TX) + c_2(TX) = 1 + 0 + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4$. \n\nTherefore, the total Chern class of the vector bundle is $c(TX) \\cdot (1+a)^n = 4 \\cdot 1 = 4$."
