    "message_1": "Consider the language of arithmetic with symbols for addition and multiplication. Let T be the collection of sentences that are true in the standard model of arithmetic. Determine whether the sentence \"There exists a prime number\" is in T.",
    "message_2": "Yes, the sentence \"There exists a prime number\" is in T.\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. Since there are prime numbers in the standard model of arithmetic (the natural numbers), the sentence \"There exists a prime number\" is true in the standard model of arithmetic and therefore belongs to the collection T."
