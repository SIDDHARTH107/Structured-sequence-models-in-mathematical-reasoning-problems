    "message_2": "To find the order of an elliptic curve over a finite field, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity. The given elliptic curve equation is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 4x + 4\n\nWe will check all possible x and y values in the finite field ùîΩ13 and see if they satisfy the equation. If they do, we count them as a point on the curve.\n\nHere are the points on the curve:\n\n(0, 2), (0, 11), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 10), (3, 1), (3, 12), (4, 4), (4, 9), (5, 0), (6, 6), (6, 7), (8, 1), (8, 12), (9, 5), (9, 8), (10, 2), (10, 11), (11, 3), (11, 10), (12, 6), (12, 7)\n\nThere are 23 points on the curve, and we also need to include the point at infinity. So, the order of the elliptic curve over the finite field ùîΩ13 is 24."
