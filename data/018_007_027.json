    "message_2": "Let A = {a, b, c} be a set with 3 elements.\n\n1. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. So, P(A) = {âˆ…, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}.\n\n2. The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. The cardinality of A is 3, as there are 3 elements in A (a, b, and c). The cardinality of the power set of A, P(A), is 8, as there are 8 subsets in P(A).\n\n3. To show that the cardinality of the power set of A is always larger than the cardinality of A, we can use a general formula for the cardinality of the power set of a set with n elements. The formula is 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set. In our case, A has 3 elements, so the cardinality of P(A) is 2^3 = 8. Since 8 > 3, the cardinality of the power set of A is larger than the cardinality of A. In general, for any set with n elements, the cardinality of its power set will be 2^n, which is always greater than n for any positive integer n."
