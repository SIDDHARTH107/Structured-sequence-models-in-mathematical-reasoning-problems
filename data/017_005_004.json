    "message_2": "To determine whether G is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, we have that |G| = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide 3^0 = 1 and satisfy n_3 â‰¡ 1 (mod 3). The only possibility is n_3 = 1. Let P be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, by the Sylow theorems, P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. By the classification of groups of order p^2 (where p is a prime), P must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. If P is cyclic, then G has a normal subgroup of order 9, and since |G : P| = 3, G must be a semidirect product of P and a subgroup of order 3. In this case, G is not cyclic, as it has a nontrivial semidirect product structure.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, as desired.\n\nIn either case, G is not cyclic. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
