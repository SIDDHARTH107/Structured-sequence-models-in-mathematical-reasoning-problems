    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square using the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\nWe can start by filling in the first row with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in any order. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to do this, which is 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, let's fill in the second row. Since each number must appear exactly once in each column, there are only 2 possible ways to fill in the second row for each arrangement of the first row.\n\nFinally, the third row will be determined by the arrangement of the first two rows, as there is only one way to fill in the third row so that each number appears exactly once in each column.\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to fill in the first row and 2 ways to fill in the second row for each arrangement of the first row, giving us a total of 6 x 2 = 12 possible 3x3 Latin squares using the numbers 1, 2, and 3."
