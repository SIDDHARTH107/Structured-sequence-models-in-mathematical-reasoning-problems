    "message_2": "To find the value of f(i), we simply substitute i for z in the given function:\n\nf(i) = (i)^3 - 2(i)^2 + 3(i) - 4\n\nRecall that i^2 = -1 and i^3 = -i. Now, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf(i) = (-i) - 2(-1) + 3(i) - 4\nf(i) = -i + 2 + 3i - 4\nf(i) = 2i - 2\n\nSo, the value of f(i) is 2i - 2."
