If both cooperate, they will each receive 5 points. If one defects and the other cooperates, the defector will receive 10 points and the cooperator will receive 1 point. If both defect, they will each receive 3 points.\n\nWrite out the matrix of payoffs for the game and determine whether there is a dominant strategy for either player. If not, find the Nash Equilibrium of the game.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write out the matrix of payoffs for the game. We will represent the payoffs as (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff).\n\n```\n          Player 2\n          C     D\n        +-----+-----+\n   C    |(5,5)|(1,10)|\nPlayer 1 +-----+-----+\n   D    |(10,1)|(3,3)|\n        +-----+-----+\n```\n\nNow, let's determine if there is a dominant strategy for either player.\n\nFor Player 1:\n- If Player 2 chooses to cooperate (C), Player 1 gets 5 points for cooperating and 10 points for defecting. In this case, defecting (D) is better for Player 1.\n- If Player 2 chooses to defect (D), Player 1 gets 1 point for cooperating and 3 points for defecting. In this case, defecting (D) is also better for Player 1.\n\nSo, Player 1 has a dominant strategy, which is to defect (D).\n\nFor Player 2:\n- If Player 1 chooses to cooperate (C), Player 2 gets 5 points for cooperating and 10 points for defecting. In this case, defecting (D) is better for Player 2.\n- If Player 1 chooses to defect (D), Player 2 gets 1 point for cooperating and 3 points for defecting. In this case, defecting (D) is also better for Player 2.\n\nSo, Player 2 also has a dominant strategy, which is to defect (D).\n\nSince both players have a dominant strategy to defect (D), the Nash Equilibrium of the game is when both players choose to defect (D). In this case, the payoffs are (3, 3)."
