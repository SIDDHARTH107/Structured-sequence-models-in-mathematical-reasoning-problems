    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, since n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), the only possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it is normal in G. Let P be this unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^3 = 27, which is the same as the order of G, we have P = G. Thus, G is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either cyclic or a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 27\nIf there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups, then each of them has order 3^2 = 9. Let P be one of these 3-Sylow subgroups. Since the index of P in G is [G:P] = 27/9 = 3, which is the smallest prime dividing the order of G, P is normal in G by the Minimal Normal Subgroup Theorem. Let Q be another 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their intersection P ∩ Q is also normal in G. The order of P ∩ Q divides both the order of P and the order of Q, which are both 9. Thus, the order of P ∩ Q is either 1, 3, or 9.\n\nIf the order of P ∩ Q is 9, then P ∩ Q = P = Q, which contradicts the assumption that there are 27 distinct 3-Sylow subgroups. If the order of P ∩ Q is 3, then P ∩ Q is a normal subgroup of G of order 3, which implies that G has a normal subgroup of order 3. However, this contradicts the assumption that there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups, as there can't be a unique normal subgroup of order 3 in this case. Therefore, the order of P ∩ Q must be 1, which means P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the product PQ of the elements of P and Q. Since P and Q are both normal in G, PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, the order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 9 * 9 / 1 = 81, which is greater than the order of G. This is a contradiction, as a subgroup cannot have an order greater than the group itself.\n\nThus, we conclude that the only possible case is Case 1, where G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
