    "message_2": "To determine the value of the Betti number b1(X), we will use the Poincaré duality theorem. The Poincaré duality theorem states that for a compact connected topological space X of dimension n, the Betti numbers satisfy the following relation:\n\nb_k(X) = b_{n-k}(X)\n\nIn our case, X is a compact connected topological space with b0(X) = 1 and b2(X) = 3. Since b0(X) = 1, we know that X is connected. To apply the Poincaré duality theorem, we need to determine the dimension of X.\n\nSince b2(X) = 3, we know that there are three linearly independent 2-dimensional homology classes in X. This implies that X has dimension at least 2. If X had dimension greater than 2, then by Poincaré duality, we would have non-zero Betti numbers for dimensions greater than 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, X has dimension 2.\n\nNow we can apply the Poincaré duality theorem:\n\nb1(X) = b_{2-1}(X) = b_1(X)\n\nThis equation doesn't give us any new information. However, we can use the Euler characteristic to find b1(X). The Euler characteristic χ(X) of a compact connected topological space X is given by:\n\nχ(X) = Σ(-1)^i * b_i(X)\n\nFor a compact connected surface without boundary, the Euler characteristic is related to the genus g of the surface by the formula:\n\nχ(X) = 2 - 2g\n\nSince X is connected and has dimension 2, it is a compact connected surface without boundary. We are given that b0(X) = 1 and b2(X) = 3. We can plug these values into the formula for the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ(X) = b0(X) - b1(X) + b2(X) = 1 - b1(X) + 3\n\nNow we need to determine the genus g of X. Since b2(X) = 3, we know that X has three linearly independent 2-dimensional homology classes. This implies that X is a connected sum of three projective planes:\n\nX = RP^2 # RP^2 # RP^2\n\nThe connected sum of three projective planes has genus g = 1. Therefore, we can use the formula for the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ(X) = 2 - 2g = 2 - 2(1) = 0\n\nNow we can solve for b1(X):\n\n0 = 1 - b1(X) + 3\nb1(X) = 4\n\nSo the Betti number b1(X) is 4."
