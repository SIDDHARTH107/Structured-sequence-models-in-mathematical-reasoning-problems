    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 3(x + 4y) = 3(10)\n(2) 1(3x - y) = 1(5)\n\nNow we have:\n\n(1) 3x + 12y = 30\n(2) 3x - y = 5\n\nNext, we will subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (2): (3x + 12y) - (3x - y) = 30 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n13y = 25\n\nNow, we will solve for y:\n\ny = 25/13\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for x. We will use equation (1):\n\nx + 4(25/13) = 10\n\nx + 100/13 = 10\n\nNow, we will subtract 100/13 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 10 - 100/13\n\nTo subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 13:\n\nx = (130 - 100)/13\n\nx = 30/13\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 30/13 and y = 25/13"
