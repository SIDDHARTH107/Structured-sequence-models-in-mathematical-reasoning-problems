    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\nd(x^2)/dx + d(2y^3)/dx = d(25)/dx\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n2x + 6y^2(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 3. We can do this by plugging x = 3 into the original equation:\n\n(3)^2 + 2y^3 = 25\n9 + 2y^3 = 25\n2y^3 = 16\ny^3 = 8\ny = 2\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx) when x = 3:\n\n2(3) + 6(2)^2(dy/dx) = 0\n6 + 24(dy/dx) = 0\n24(dy/dx) = -6\n(dy/dx) = -6/24\n(dy/dx) = -1/4\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 3 is -1/4."
