    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 3 labor hours and 4 material units, whereas each unit of Product B requires 4 labor hours and 3 material units. The labor available is 500 hours and the materials available are 400 units. The profit per unit of Product A is $10 and the profit per unit of Product B is $8. Determine the number of units of each product the company should produce to maximize its profit, given the constraints.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The constraints can be written as:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 500 (labor constraint)\n4x + 3y ≤ 400 (material constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 8y\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 4y ≤ 500\ny ≤ (500 - 3x) / 4\n\n2. 4x + 3y ≤ 400\ny ≤ (400 - 4x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied, and x and y are non-negative.\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (500 - 3x) / 4 and y = (400 - 4x) / 3:\n(500 - 3x) / 4 = (400 - 4x) / 3\n1500 - 9x = 1600 - 16x\n7x = 100\nx = 100 / 7 ≈ 14.29\n\ny = (500 - 3 * 100/7) / 4 ≈ 32.14\n\n2. Intersection of y = (500 - 3x) / 4 and x = 0:\ny = 500 / 4 = 125\n\n3. Intersection of y = (400 - 4x) / 3 and x = 0:\ny = 400 / 3 ≈ 133.33\n\n4. Intersection of y = (500 - 3x) / 4 and y = 0:\nx = 500 / 3 ≈ 166.67\n\n5. Intersection of y = (400 - 4x) / 3 and y = 0:\nx = 100\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at approximately (0, 125), (0, 133.33), (14.29, 32.14), (100, 0), and (166.67, 0). We'll now evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 125) = 10 * 0 + 8 * 125 = $1000\n2. P(0, 133.33) = 10 * 0 + 8 * 133.33 = $1066.64\n3. P(14.29, 32.14) = 10 * 14.29 + 8 * 32.14 = $428.60\n4. P(100, 0) = 10 * 100 + 8 * 0 = $1000\n5. P(166.67, 0) = 10 * 166.67 + 8 * 0 = $1666.70\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (166.67, 0), with a profit of approximately $1666.70. However, since the company can only produce whole units of products, we need to check the profit for the closest integer values of x and y:\n\n1. P(166, 0) = 10 * 166 + 8 * 0 = $1660\n2. P(167, 0) = 10 * 167 + 8 * 0 = $1670\n\nThe company should produce 167 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize its profit, with a maximum profit of $1670."
