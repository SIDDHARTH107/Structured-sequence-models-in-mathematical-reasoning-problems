He randomly selects 40 students and finds their average score to be 75 with a standard deviation of 10. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean score of all students in the statistics exam?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean score, we can use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- x̄ is the sample mean (75)\n- Z is the Z-score for the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence)\n- σ is the standard deviation (10)\n- n is the sample size (40)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 10 / √40 ≈ 1.58\n\nNext, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 1.58 ≈ 3.1\n\nFinally, we can find the confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± ME = 75 ± 3.1\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true population mean score of all students in the statistics exam is approximately (71.9, 78.1)."
