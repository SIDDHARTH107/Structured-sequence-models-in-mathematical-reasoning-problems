    "message_1": "Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension 2 and let X be the vector field on M defined by X = x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y, where x and y are the Cartesian coordinates on M. Determine the Lie derivative of the vector field X with respect to the vector field Y = 2x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y at the point (1,3) on M.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of the vector field X with respect to the vector field Y, we use the Lie bracket [Y, X], which is defined as [Y, X] = YX - XY.\n\nFirst, let's compute YX:\n\nYX = (2x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y)(x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y)\n\n= 2x ∂/∂x (x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y) + y ∂/∂y (x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y)\n\n= 2x (x ∂²/∂x² + y ∂²/∂x∂y) + y (x ∂²/∂x∂y + y ∂²/∂y²)\n\nNow, let's compute XY:\n\nXY = (x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y)(2x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y)\n\n= x ∂/∂x (2x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y) + y ∂/∂y (2x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y)\n\n= x (2x ∂²/∂x² + y ∂²/∂x∂y) + y (2x ∂²/∂x∂y + y ∂²/∂y²)\n\nNow we compute the Lie bracket [Y, X] = YX - XY:\n\n[Y, X] = (2x (x ∂²/∂x² + y ∂²/∂x∂y) + y (x ∂²/∂x∂y + y ∂²/∂y²)) - (x (2x ∂²/∂x² + y ∂²/∂x∂y) + y (2x ∂²/∂x∂y + y ∂²/∂y²))\n\n= x ∂²/∂x² + y ∂²/∂x∂y\n\nNow, we evaluate the Lie derivative at the point (1, 3):\n\nL_YX(1, 3) = 1 ∂²/∂x² + 3 ∂²/∂x∂y\n\nSince the Lie derivative is a vector field, the result is still a vector field. In this case, the Lie derivative of X with respect to Y at the point (1, 3) is given by the vector field L_YX = ∂/∂x + 3 ∂/∂y."
