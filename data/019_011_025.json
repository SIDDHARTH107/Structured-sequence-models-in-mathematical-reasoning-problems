    "message_1": "Given the premises \"All mammals are warm-blooded\" and \"All whales are mammals,\" use relevance logic to determine whether the following conclusion is valid: \"All whales are warm-blooded.\" (Answer: valid)",
    "message_2": "In relevance logic, we analyze the premises and the conclusion to determine if the conclusion is relevantly entailed by the premises. In this case, we have the following premises:\n\nPremise 1: All mammals are warm-blooded.\nPremise 2: All whales are mammals.\n\nWe want to determine if the conclusion \"All whales are warm-blooded\" is valid based on these premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the transitive property of the relation \"is a subset of.\" If A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. In this case, we can think of the set of whales as a subset of the set of mammals, and the set of mammals as a subset of the set of warm-blooded animals.\n\nSince all whales are mammals (Premise 2), and all mammals are warm-blooded (Premise 1), we can conclude that all whales are warm-blooded by the transitive property. Therefore, the conclusion \"All whales are warm-blooded\" is valid based on the given premises."
