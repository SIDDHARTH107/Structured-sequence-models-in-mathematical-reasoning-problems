    "message_2": "A Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is formed by successively adding smaller squares to the initial square. After each iteration, the length of the perimeter increases by a factor of 3.\n\nLet P(n) be the perimeter of the Vicsek fractal after n iterations. We have:\n\nP(0) = 4 (initial square with 1 unit side length)\nP(1) = 4 * 3^1\nP(2) = 4 * 3^2\nP(3) = 4 * 3^3\nP(4) = 4 * 3^4\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter after 4 iterations:\n\nP(4) = 4 * 3^4 = 4 * 81 = 324\n\nSo, the length of the perimeter of a Vicsek fractal after 4 iterations is 324 units."
