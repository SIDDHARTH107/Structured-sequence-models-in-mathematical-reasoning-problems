    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = 2x and y = x^2, we need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval where they intersect, which is from x = 0 to x = 2.\n\nThe difference between the two functions is (2x - x^2). We will integrate this difference with respect to x from 0 to 2:\n\nâˆ«(2x - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of (2x - x^2):\n\nF(x) = x^2 - (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we evaluate F(x) at the bounds of integration:\n\nF(2) = (2)^2 - (1/3)(2)^3 + C = 4 - (8/3) + C\nF(0) = (0)^2 - (1/3)(0)^3 + C = 0 + C\n\nNow, we find the difference between F(2) and F(0):\n\nArea = F(2) - F(0) = (4 - 8/3) - 0 = (12 - 8)/3 = 4/3\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = 2x and y = x^2 is 4/3 square units."
