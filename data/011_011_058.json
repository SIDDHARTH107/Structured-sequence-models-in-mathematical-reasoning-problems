    "message_2": "A partition of an integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. In this case, we want to find the number of partitions of 10 with exactly 3 distinct parts. Let's represent the 3 distinct parts as a, b, and c, with a > b > c > 0.\n\nWe can consider the following cases:\n\n1. a = 6, b = 3, c = 1\n   10 = 6 + 3 + 1\n\n2. a = 5, b = 4, c = 1\n   10 = 5 + 4 + 1\n\n3. a = 5, b = 3, c = 2\n   10 = 5 + 3 + 2\n\nThese are all the possible partitions of 10 with exactly 3 distinct parts. Therefore, there are 3 such partitions."
