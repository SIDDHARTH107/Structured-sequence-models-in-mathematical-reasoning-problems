    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and the following degree sequence: 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Is this a valid degree sequence for a graph? If yes, draw a possible graph that can have such degree sequence. If no, explain why it is not possible.",
    "message_2": "Yes, this is a valid degree sequence for a graph. To check if a degree sequence is valid, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be even. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18, which is even, so it is a valid degree sequence.\n\nA possible graph with this degree sequence can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, with degrees 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, and 1, respectively.\n2. Connect vertex A to vertices B, C, D, and E (A has a degree of 4).\n3. Connect vertex B to vertices C and F (B has a degree of 3).\n4. Connect vertex C to vertex G (C has a degree of 3).\n5. Connect vertex D to vertex H (D has a degree of 3).\n6. Vertex E already has a degree of 2, and vertices F, G, and H already have a degree of 1, so no more connections are needed.\n\nThe resulting graph has the desired degree sequence:\n\nA: B, C, D, E (degree 4)\nB: A, C, F (degree 3)\nC: A, B, G (degree 3)\nD: A, H (degree 3)\nE: A (degree 2)\nF: B (degree 1)\nG: C (degree 1)\nH: D (degree 1)"
