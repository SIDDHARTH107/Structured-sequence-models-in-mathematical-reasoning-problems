    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization method that is typically used for combinatorial optimization problems. However, we can still attempt to apply it to this continuous optimization problem. Here's a simple implementation of the tabu search method for the given function:\n\n1. Define the objective function: f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + x + 10\n2. Initialize the search space, tabu list, and other parameters:\n   - Search space: Let's assume the search space is between -10 and 10.\n   - Tabu list: An empty list to store recently visited solutions.\n   - Tabu tenure: The number of iterations a solution remains in the tabu list (e.g., 5).\n   - Number of iterations: The total number of iterations to perform (e.g., 100).\n   - Step size: The size of the step to take when exploring the neighborhood (e.g., 0.1).\n\n3. Start the search:\n   - Choose an initial solution x0 randomly from the search space.\n   - Set the current best solution to x0.\n   - For each iteration:\n       a. Generate a neighborhood of solutions around the current solution by adding and subtracting the step size.\n       b. Evaluate the objective function for each solution in the neighborhood.\n       c. Choose the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list.\n       d. Update the current best solution if the chosen solution has a better objective function value.\n       e. Add the chosen solution to the tabu list and remove the oldest solution if the tabu list exceeds the tabu tenure.\n\n4. Return the best solution found.\n\nPlease note that this method may not guarantee finding the global minimum, and the result may depend on the chosen parameters. For a more accurate solution, it is recommended to use calculus-based optimization methods, such as gradient descent or Newton's method."
