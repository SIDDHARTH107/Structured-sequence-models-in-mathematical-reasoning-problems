    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 60 and 84 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (84) by the smaller number (60) and find the remainder.\n   84 รท 60 = 1 with a remainder of 24.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (84) with the smaller number (60) and the smaller number with the remainder (24) from the previous step.\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n\n   60 รท 24 = 2 with a remainder of 12.\n\n   Replace 60 with 24 and 24 with 12.\n\n   24 รท 12 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 12.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60 and 84 is 12."
