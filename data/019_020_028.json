    "message_1": "Suppose you have an algorithm that takes an input list of n numbers and sorts them using insertion sort. The worst-case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2). If the input list contains 100 elements and the algorithm takes 1 second to sort the list, approximately how long would it take to sort a list with 1,000 elements using the same algorithm?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the time it takes to sort a list of n elements as T(n). Since the worst-case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2), we can write the relationship between the time it takes to sort a list and the number of elements in the list as:\n\nT(n) = k * n^2\n\nwhere k is a constant factor.\n\nGiven that it takes 1 second to sort a list of 100 elements, we can find the value of k:\n\n1 = k * (100^2)\n1 = k * 10,000\nk = 1/10,000 = 0.0001\n\nNow, we want to find out how long it would take to sort a list of 1,000 elements. Using the same relationship, we have:\n\nT(1,000) = 0.0001 * (1,000^2)\nT(1,000) = 0.0001 * 1,000,000\nT(1,000) = 100\n\nSo, it would take approximately 100 seconds to sort a list of 1,000 elements using the same algorithm."
