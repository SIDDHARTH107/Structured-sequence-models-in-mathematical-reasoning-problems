    "message_1": "A person standing on the ground looks up at a hot air balloon. The angle of elevation from the person to the balloon is 60 degrees. The person walks 100 feet closer to the balloon and the angle of elevation increases to 75 degrees. How high is the balloon from the ground?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the hot air balloon as h, the initial distance between the person and the balloon as d, and the distance after the person walks 100 feet closer as d-100. We can use the tangent function to set up two equations based on the angle of elevation and the height of the balloon.\n\nFor the initial angle of elevation (60 degrees):\ntan(60) = h/d\n√3 = h/d (since tan(60) = √3)\n\nFor the angle of elevation after the person walks 100 feet closer (75 degrees):\ntan(75) = h/(d-100)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (h and d):\n\n1) h = d√3\n2) tan(75) = h/(d-100)\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of d from equation 1 and substitute it into equation 2:\n\ntan(75) = (d√3)/(d-100)\n\nNow we can solve for d:\n\nd√3 = tan(75)(d-100)\n\nDivide both sides by d:\n\n√3 = tan(75) - (100*tan(75))/d\n\nNow, isolate d:\n\nd = 100*tan(75) / (tan(75) - √3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nd ≈ 173.21 feet\n\nNow that we have the value of d, we can find the height of the balloon (h) using equation 1:\n\nh = d√3\nh ≈ 173.21 * √3\nh ≈ 299.99 feet\n\nSo, the height of the hot air balloon from the ground is approximately 300 feet."
