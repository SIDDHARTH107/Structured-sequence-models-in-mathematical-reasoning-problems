    "message_2": "To find the probability of a thunderstorm occurring at least once during the month of May, we can first find the probability of a thunderstorm not occurring on any given day in May and then use that to find the probability of a thunderstorm not occurring throughout the entire month. Finally, we'll subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of a thunderstorm occurring at least once.\n\nThe probability of a thunderstorm not occurring on any given day in May is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\n\nThere are 31 days in May. The probability of a thunderstorm not occurring on all 31 days is (0.85)^31 ≈ 0.018.\n\nNow, we'll subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of a thunderstorm occurring at least once during the month of May:\n\n1 - 0.018 ≈ 0.982.\n\nSo, the probability of a thunderstorm occurring at least once in a region during the month of May is approximately 0.982 or 98.2%."
