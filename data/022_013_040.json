    "message_2": "To find the domain and range of the function f(z) = (4z^2 - 1)/(z - 1), where z is a complex number, we first need to find the values of z for which the function is undefined. The function will be undefined when the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nDenominator: z - 1 = 0\nSolving for z, we get z = 1.\n\nSo, the function is undefined when z = 1. Therefore, the domain of the function is all complex numbers except z = 1. In set notation, the domain is:\n\nDomain: {z ∈ ℂ | z ≠ 1}\n\nNow, let's find the range of the function. To do this, we can try to simplify the function and see if there are any values of f(z) that cannot be achieved.\n\nWe can factor the numerator of the function:\n\n4z^2 - 1 = (2z + 1)(2z - 1)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = [(2z + 1)(2z - 1)]/(z - 1)\n\nWe can't simplify this expression any further. Since z can be any complex number except 1, the function can take any complex value except for the value when z = 1. To find this value, we can take the limit as z approaches 1:\n\nlim (z->1) [(2z + 1)(2z - 1)]/(z - 1)\n\nUsing L'Hopital's rule (since the limit is in the form 0/0), we differentiate the numerator and denominator with respect to z:\n\nNumerator: d/dz [(2z + 1)(2z - 1)] = 4z + 2 - 4z + 2 = 4\nDenominator: d/dz (z - 1) = 1\n\nNow, we can find the limit:\n\nlim (z->1) [4/1] = 4\n\nSo, the function can take any complex value except for f(z) = 4 when z = 1. Therefore, the range of the function is all complex numbers except f(z) = 4. In set notation, the range is:\n\nRange: {f(z) ∈ ℂ | f(z) ≠ 4}"
