    "message_1": "There are 7 cities that a traveler wants to visit. The traveler wants to plan a trip starting and ending in the same city, where each city is visited exactly once, and each city is connected by a direct flight to exactly 3 other cities. How many different trip routes can the traveler take?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using graph theory. Since each city is connected to exactly 3 other cities, the degree of each vertex (city) in the graph is 3. However, for a graph to have an Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that visits each edge exactly once), all vertices must have an even degree. Since the degree of each vertex in this problem is odd (3), there is no Eulerian circuit, and thus, there are no trip routes that meet the given conditions. The traveler cannot visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city with each city connected to exactly 3 other cities."
