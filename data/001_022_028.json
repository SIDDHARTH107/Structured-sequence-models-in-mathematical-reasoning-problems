    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6\n\nWe can try to factor the polynomial or use synthetic division to find the roots. In this case, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nTesting these possible roots, we find that x = -3, x = 1, and x = 2 are the roots:\n\n0 = (x + 3)(x - 1)(x - 2)\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are (-3, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0).\n\nTo sketch the graph, we can use the following information:\n\n1. The polynomial is a cubic with a positive leading coefficient, so the graph will have a general shape of \"n\" (rising to the left and rising to the right).\n2. The x-intercepts are (-3, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0).\n3. The y-intercept can be found by setting x = 0: y = (0)^3 + 2(0)^2 - 5(0) - 6 = -6. So, the y-intercept is (0, -6).\n\nUsing this information, we can sketch the graph of the polynomial equation. The graph will pass through the x-intercepts (-3, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0), as well as the y-intercept (0, -6). The graph will have a general \"n\" shape, rising to the left and right."
