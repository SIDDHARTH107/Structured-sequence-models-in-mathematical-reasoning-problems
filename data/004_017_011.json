    "message_2": "To find the length of the wire, we need to compute the arc length of the curve defined by the function y = x^(3/2) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 4. We can do this using the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x^(3/2) with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = (3/2) * x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = 1 + ((3/2) * x^(1/2))^2 = 1 + (9/4) * x\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of the expression:\n\nsqrt(1 + (9/4) * x)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the arc length:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + (9/4) * x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = 1 + (9/4) * x. Then, du/dx = (9/4), and dx = (4/9) * du. The new integral limits are:\n\nu(0) = 1 + (9/4) * 0 = 1\nu(4) = 1 + (9/4) * 4 = 1 + 9 = 10\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 10] sqrt(u) * (4/9) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * ∫[1, 10] u^(1/2) du = (4/9) * [(2/3) * u^(3/2)] [1, 10]\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nL = (4/9) * [(2/3) * (10^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))]\n\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - 1)\n\nNow, we can compute the length of the wire:\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * (31.6227766 - 1) ≈ 9.151882\n\nThe length of the wire is approximately 9.15 units."
