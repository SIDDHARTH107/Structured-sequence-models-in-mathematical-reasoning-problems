    "message_2": "To find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 36 and 54, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (54) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n54 รท 36 = 1, remainder 18.\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (36) and the smaller number with the remainder (18) from the previous step.\nNow, we need to find the GCD of 36 and 18.\n\n3. Divide 36 by 18.\n36 รท 18 = 2, remainder 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD of 36 and 54 is the divisor in the last step, which is 18."
