    "message_2": "There are five non-abelian groups of order 60 up to isomorphism. One such non-abelian group of order 60 is the symmetric group S_5, which is the group of all permutations of 5 elements.\n\nThe structure of S_5 can be described as follows:\n\n1. It contains 5! = 120 elements.\n2. It has a subgroup of order 60, which is the alternating group A_5, consisting of all even permutations of 5 elements.\n3. A_5 is a simple group, meaning it has no nontrivial normal subgroups.\n4. S_5 is generated by a 2-cycle (transposition) and a 5-cycle, for example, (1 2) and (1 2 3 4 5).\n\nNote that the other four non-abelian groups of order 60 are not as well-known or easily described as S_5, but they do exist."
