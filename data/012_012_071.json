    "message_1": "Consider a connected undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. Determine the girth of this graph.",
    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of this graph, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth ≤ 2 * (number of edges) / (number of vertices)\n\nIn this case, the number of vertices is 10 and the number of edges is 15. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth ≤ 2 * 15 / 10\ngirth ≤ 3\n\nSince the girth is an integer value and represents the length of the shortest cycle, the minimum possible value for the girth is 3 (a triangle). Therefore, the girth of this graph is 3."
