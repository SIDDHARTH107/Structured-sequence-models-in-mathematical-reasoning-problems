So, we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(iωx) * e^(-i2πkx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(i(ωx - 2πkx))] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(ix(ω - 2πk))] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nF(k) = (1/i(ω - 2πk)) * [e^(ix(ω - 2πk))] from -∞ to ∞\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we need to consider the limit as x approaches ±∞. The integral converges only when ω = 2πk, and in that case, the function inside the integral becomes e^(0) = 1. So, we have:\n\nF(k) = (1/i(ω - 2πk)) * [1] from -∞ to ∞, when ω = 2πk\nF(k) = 0, otherwise\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of the complex function f(x) = e^(iωx) is:\n\nF(k) = δ(ω - 2πk) / i(ω - 2πk)\n\nHere, δ(ω - 2πk) is the Dirac delta function, which is 0 for all values except when ω = 2πk, and in that case, it is infinite."
