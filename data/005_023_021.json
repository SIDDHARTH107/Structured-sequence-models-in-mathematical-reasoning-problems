    "message_2": "To find if there are any outliers in the age data using the interquartile range method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order.\n2. Find the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2, which is the median), and the third quartile (Q3).\n3. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3.\n4. Find the lower and upper bounds for outliers by calculating Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR, respectively.\n5. Check if any data points fall outside these bounds.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. The data is already in ascending order: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.\n\n2. Since there are 10 data points, we can find the quartiles as follows:\n   - Q1: The median of the first half (12, 13, 14, 15, 16) is 14.\n   - Q2: The median of the entire dataset (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) is the average of 15 and 16, which is 15.5.\n   - Q3: The median of the second half (17, 18, 19, 20, 21) is 19.\n\n3. Calculate the IQR: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 19 - 14 = 5.\n\n4. Find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n   - Lower bound: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 14 - 1.5 * 5 = 14 - 7.5 = 6.5\n   - Upper bound: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 19 + 1.5 * 5 = 19 + 7.5 = 26.5\n\n5. Check if any data points fall outside these bounds:\n   - All the ages (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) are within the lower and upper bounds (6.5 and 26.5).\n\nSince no data points fall outside the lower and upper bounds, there are no outliers in the age data using the interquartile range method."
