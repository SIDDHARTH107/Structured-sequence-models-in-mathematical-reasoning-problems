    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using block matrices, we can rewrite the given matrix equation as:\n\n[ A | B ] * [ X ] = [ C ]\n\nwhere A = [7 -4], B = [5], X = [x1 x2]^T, and C = [33 7]^T.\n\nNow, we can partition the matrix A into two blocks, A1 and A2, and the matrix X into two blocks, X1 and X2, as follows:\n\nA1 = [7], A2 = [-4], X1 = [x1], and X2 = [x2].\n\nNow, we can rewrite the matrix equation as:\n\n[ A1 A2 ] * [ X1 ] = [ C ]\n[         ]   [ X2 ]\n\nMultiplying the block matrices, we get:\n\nA1 * X1 + A2 * X2 = C\n\nSubstituting the values of A1, A2, X1, X2, and C, we get:\n\n[7] * [x1] + [-4] * [x2] = [33]\n[2] * [x1] + [-1] * [x2] = [ 7]\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations:\n\n7x1 - 4x2 = 33\n2x1 - 1x2 = 7\n\nTo solve for x1, we can multiply the second equation by 2 and then subtract it from the first equation:\n\n(7x1 - 4x2) - 2(2x1 - x2) = 33 - 2(7)\n7x1 - 4x2 - 4x1 + 2x2 = 33 - 14\n3x1 - 2x2 = 19\n\nNow, we can solve for x1:\n\n3x1 = 19 + 2x2\nx1 = (19 + 2x2) / 3\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for x1 back into the second equation:\n\n2((19 + 2x2) / 3) - x2 = 7\n(38 + 4x2) / 3 - x2 = 7\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n38 + 4x2 - 3x2 = 21\nx2 = 21 - 38\nx2 = -17\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x2 back into the expression for x1:\n\nx1 = (19 + 2(-17)) / 3\nx1 = (19 - 34) / 3\nx1 = -15 / 3\nx1 = -5\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x1 = -5 and x2 = -17."
