    "message_2": "The number of models (up to isomorphism) of the theory of an infinite set with two distinguished points is 1.\n\nHere's why: Let's consider two models M and N of this theory. Both M and N have an infinite set and two distinguished points, say a and b in M, and c and d in N. We can define a bijection f: M -> N such that f(a) = c and f(b) = d. Since both M and N are infinite sets, we can extend this bijection to cover all elements in M and N.\n\nThis bijection f preserves the structure of the models, as it maps the distinguished points in M to the distinguished points in N. Therefore, M and N are isomorphic, and there is only one model of this theory up to isomorphism."
