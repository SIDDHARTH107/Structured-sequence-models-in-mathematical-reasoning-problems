    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set is a subset of set A. Here's the working to show how we arrived at this answer:\n\nBy definition, a set B is a subset of set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. In other words, if x ∈ B, then x ∈ A.\n\nIn the case of the empty set (B = {}), there are no elements in B. Therefore, there are no elements in B that are not in A. This means that the condition for being a subset (if x ∈ B, then x ∈ A) is trivially satisfied, as there are no elements in B to check.\n\nHence, the empty set is a subset of any set, including set A. So, B ⊆ A."
