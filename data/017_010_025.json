Prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10 by showing the following:\na) If G has an element of order 10, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C10.\nb) If G does not have an element of order 10 but has an element of order 5, then G is isomorphic to D5.\nc) If G does not have an element of order 5 or 10, then G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.",
    "message_2": "a) If G has an element of order 10, let's call it a, then we have a^10 = e (identity element), and a^n ≠ e for 0 < n < 10. Since the order of G is 10, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Since there is an element of order 10, we can generate the entire group G by the powers of a: G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, ..., a^9}. Thus, G is a cyclic group generated by a, and G is isomorphic to C10.\n\nb) If G does not have an element of order 10 but has an element of order 5, let's call it b. Then b^5 = e, and b^n ≠ e for 0 < n < 5. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 5. Since G has an element of order 5, there must also be an element of order 2, let's call it a (a^2 = e, a ≠ e). Now, consider the element ab. Since G has no element of order 10, the order of ab cannot be 10. Also, the order of ab cannot be 1, as that would imply ab = e, which contradicts the fact that a and b have different orders. Therefore, the order of ab must be 2 or 5. \n\nIf the order of ab is 5, then (ab)^5 = e, and we have a^5b^5 = e. But b^5 = e, so a^5 = e, which contradicts the fact that a has order 2. Thus, the order of ab must be 2, and we have (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = e. Since a^2 = e, we get abab = e, which is a relation in the dihedral group D5. \n\nNow, we can generate G using a and b: G = {e, a, b, b^2, b^3, b^4, ab, ab^2, ab^3, ab^4}. This shows that G is isomorphic to D5.\n\nc) If G does not have an element of order 5 or 10, then by Lagrange's theorem, the only possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 2. However, this would imply that G is a group of order 2^k for some integer k (by the classification of finite abelian groups), which contradicts the fact that G has order 10. Therefore, G must have an element of order 5 or 10, and we have already shown that G is isomorphic to either C10 or D5 in cases a) and b)."
