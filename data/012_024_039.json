    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces with higher genus. The Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, for a graph embedded on a surface with genus g, the formula becomes:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nWe are given a graph G with 10 vertices (V = 10) and 15 edges (E = 15). We want to find the genus g of G. To do this, we first need to find the number of faces F.\n\nLet's assume that G is a simple graph (no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices). In this case, the maximum number of edges E_max that a planar graph with V vertices can have is given by:\n\nE_max = 3V - 6\n\nFor our graph with V = 10 vertices, the maximum number of edges for a planar graph is:\n\nE_max = 3 * 10 - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24\n\nSince our graph has 15 edges, which is less than the maximum number of edges for a planar graph with 10 vertices, it is possible that G is planar (genus 0). However, we need to check if there exists an embedding of G on a surface with genus g > 0.\n\nLet's assume that G is embedded on a surface with genus g. Then, we can rewrite the Euler's formula as:\n\nF = 2 - 2g + E - V\n\nSubstituting the values for V and E, we get:\n\nF = 2 - 2g + 15 - 10 = 7 - 2g\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer value of g for which the number of faces F is non-negative:\n\n7 - 2g ≥ 0\n\n2g ≤ 7\n\ng ≤ 3.5\n\nThe smallest non-negative integer value for g that satisfies this inequality is g = 0. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 0, which means that G is a planar graph."
