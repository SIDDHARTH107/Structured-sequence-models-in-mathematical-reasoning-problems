    "message_2": "A Turing machine with a two-symbol alphabet, a single tape, and a quintuple transition function can, in principle, compute any computable function, given enough time and space on the tape. Therefore, there is no smallest positive integer that cannot be calculated using such a Turing machine, as it can calculate any positive integer that can be computed by any other Turing machine or algorithm."
