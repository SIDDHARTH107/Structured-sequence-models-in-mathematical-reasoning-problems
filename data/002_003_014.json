    "message_1": "A cube with each edge measuring 8 cm needs to be wrapped. What is the total surface area that needs to be covered with the wrapping paper?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of one face, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared (s^2). In this case, the side length is 8 cm.\n\nArea of one face = s^2 = 8^2 = 64 square centimeters\n\nSince there are 6 faces on a cube, we need to multiply the area of one face by 6 to find the total surface area that needs to be covered with wrapping paper.\n\nTotal surface area = 6 Ã— 64 = 384 square centimeters\n\nSo, 384 square centimeters of wrapping paper is needed to cover the entire cube."
