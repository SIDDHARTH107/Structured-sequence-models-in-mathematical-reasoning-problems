    "message_2": "To determine the Lie algebra of the group of isometries of M, we first need to find the Killing vector fields on M. A Killing vector field is a vector field that generates a one-parameter group of isometries. The Killing equation for a vector field $X = X^1 \\partial_x + X^2 \\partial_y$ on M is given by:\n\n$$\n\\nabla_a X_b + \\nabla_b X_a = 0,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nabla_a$ is the covariant derivative associated with the metric $g$. In coordinates, this equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\partial_a X_b + \\partial_b X_a - \\Gamma^c_{ab} X_c = 0,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Gamma^c_{ab}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the metric $g$. We first need to compute the Christoffel symbols. The non-vanishing Christoffel symbols are given by:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma^c_{ab} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{cd} (\\partial_a g_{bd} + \\partial_b g_{ad} - \\partial_d g_{ab}),\n$$\n\nwhere $g^{cd}$ is the inverse of the metric $g$. In our case, the inverse metric is:\n\n$$\ng^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{4\\sin^2 x} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nComputing the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols, we find:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma^x_{yy} = -\\sin x \\cos x, \\quad \\Gamma^y_{yx} = \\Gamma^y_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cot x.\n$$\n\nNow we can write down the Killing equations for the components of the Killing vector field $X = X^1 \\partial_x + X^2 \\partial_y$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\partial_x X^1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cot x X^2 = 0, \\\\\n\\partial_y X^1 + \\partial_x X^2 - \\sin x \\cos x X^2 = 0, \\\\\n\\partial_y X^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cot x X^1 = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSolving these equations, we find three linearly independent solutions:\n\n1. $X_1 = \\partial_x$,\n2. $X_2 = \\partial_y$,\n3. $X_3 = y \\partial_x + 2 \\sin x \\cos x \\partial_y$.\n\nThese three Killing vector fields form a basis for the Lie algebra of the group of isometries of M. The Lie algebra is 3-dimensional and can be denoted as $\\mathfrak{g} = \\{X_1, X_2, X_3\\}$."
