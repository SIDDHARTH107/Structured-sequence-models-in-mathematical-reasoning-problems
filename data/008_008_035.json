    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces 2 types of products - Product A and Product B. The production time for Product A is 5 hours and for Product B is 10 hours. There are 3 machines available in the company for production. Each machine can run for at most 30 hours per week. The profit for Product A is $10 and for Product B is $20. If the company wants to maximize the profit, how many units of each product should it produce per week? Use matrix methods to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced per week.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. Production time for Product A is 5 hours and for Product B is 10 hours.\n2. Each machine can run for at most 30 hours per week.\n3. There are 3 machines available for production.\n4. The profit for Product A is $10 and for Product B is $20.\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 20y, subject to the constraints:\n\n5x + 10y ≤ 30 (hours per machine)\n3 * (5x + 10y) ≤ 3 * 30 (total hours for all machines)\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the constraint equation in matrix form:\n\n| 5  10 | | x | ≤ | 30 |\n| 15 30 | | y | ≤ | 90 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of the matrix:\n\n| 5  10 |\n| 15 30 |\n\nThis matrix is singular (its determinant is 0), so we cannot find its inverse directly. However, we can notice that the second row is just a multiple of the first row (3 times the first row). This means that the second constraint is redundant, and we can ignore it.\n\nSo, we are left with the constraint:\n\n5x + 10y ≤ 30\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region for the production of products A and B. The inequality can be rewritten as:\n\ny ≤ (30 - 5x) / 10\ny ≤ 3 - 0.5x\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative (we cannot produce a negative number of products), the feasible region is defined by the following inequalities:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\ny ≤ 3 - 0.5x\n\nNow, we want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 20y within this feasible region. To do this, we can use the method of linear programming. However, since this is a simple problem, we can also solve it graphically by analyzing the corner points of the feasible region.\n\nThere are three corner points to consider:\n\n1. (0, 0) - The origin, where no products are produced.\n2. (0, 3) - The point where the company only produces Product B.\n3. (6, 0) - The point where the company only produces Product A.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 20(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 3) = 10(0) + 20(3) = $60\n3. P(6, 0) = 10(6) + 20(0) = $60\n\nBoth corner points (0, 3) and (6, 0) yield the same maximum profit of $60. This means that the company can either produce 3 units of Product B or 6 units of Product A per week to maximize their profit."
