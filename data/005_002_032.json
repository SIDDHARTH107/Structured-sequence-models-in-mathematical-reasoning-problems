    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, t is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score. Since the sample size is 50, the degrees of freedom (df) will be 49 (n - 1). For a 95% confidence interval and 49 degrees of freedom, the t-score is approximately 2.01. You can find this value using a t-distribution table or an online calculator.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 85 ± (2.01 * (10 / √50))\n\nCI = 85 ± (2.01 * (10 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 85 ± (2.01 * 1.414)\n\nCI = 85 ± 2.84\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (82.16, 87.84)."
