    "message_2": "The given equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ defines a quadric surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. To compute the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, which states that for a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$ and a hyperplane section $Y$ of $X$, the restriction map $H^k(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^k(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism for $k < n-1$ and injective for $k = n-1$.\n\nIn our case, $X$ is a smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, which has dimension $n = 2$. Thus, the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that the restriction map $H^k(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^k(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism for $k < 1$ and injective for $k = 1$. \n\nWe know that the cohomology groups of $\\mathbb{P}^2$ are given by:\n\n$H^0(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H^1(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, $H^2(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince the restriction map is an isomorphism for $k < 1$, we have $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H^0(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$. For $k = 1$, the restriction map is injective, so $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Finally, for $k = 2$, we have $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H^2(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, the second cohomology group of the given algebraic variety is $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$."
