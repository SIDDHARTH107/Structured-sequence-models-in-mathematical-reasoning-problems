    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nRecall that the intersection of two sets, A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nLet's find A ∩ B:\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nComparing the elements of A and B, we can see that the common elements are 4, 6, and 8. Therefore, A ∩ B = {4, 6, 8}.\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B:\n\nFor A:\n4 ∈ A, 6 ∈ A, and 8 ∈ A, so all elements of A ∩ B are in A.\n\nFor B:\n4 ∈ B, 6 ∈ B, and 8 ∈ B, so all elements of A ∩ B are in B.\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B."
