The cost of transporting goods between each pair of cities is given in the following table:\n\n| City Pair | Cost of Transportation (in $) |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n| A-B      | 20                          |\n| A-C      | 35                          |\n| A-D      | 25                          |\n| B-C      | 15                          |\n| B-D      | 30                          |\n| C-D      | 10                          |\n\nThe company wants to transport goods from city A to city D while minimizing the total transportation cost. Determine the optimal route for the company to use and the total cost of transportation.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route for the company to use, we will consider all possible routes from city A to city D and calculate the total cost for each route. Then, we will choose the route with the minimum cost.\n\nThere are three possible routes from city A to city D:\n\n1. A -> B -> C -> D\n2. A -> B -> D\n3. A -> C -> D\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for each route:\n\n1. A -> B -> C -> D: 20 (A-B) + 15 (B-C) + 10 (C-D) = 45\n2. A -> B -> D: 20 (A-B) + 30 (B-D) = 50\n3. A -> C -> D: 35 (A-C) + 10 (C-D) = 45\n\nComparing the total costs, we can see that routes 1 and 3 have the minimum cost of 45 dollars. Therefore, the company can choose either route 1 (A -> B -> C -> D) or route 3 (A -> C -> D) to minimize the total transportation cost, which is 45 dollars."
