If there exist two elements a and b in G satisfying the following conditions: \n1. a has order 4 \n2. b has order 5 \n3. ab=ba^3 \nthen show that the given group is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the given group by G. Since G has order 20, by the Sylow theorems, G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, say K. Let a ∈ K and b ∈ H, with orders 4 and 5, respectively. We are given that ab = ba^3.\n\nNow, let's consider the element c = ab. We will show that c has order 20, which implies that G is a cyclic group generated by c and isomorphic to C20.\n\nFirst, let's find the order of c. Since a and b are from different Sylow subgroups, they commute with their respective powers. Thus, we have:\n\nc^2 = (ab)(ab) = a(ba^3)b = a^2b^2,\nc^3 = (a^2b^2)(ab) = a^2(b^2a^2)b = a^3b^3,\nc^4 = (a^3b^3)(ab) = a^3(b^3a^3)b = a^4b^4 = b^4,\nc^5 = (b^4)(ab) = b^5a = a,\nc^6 = a(ab) = a^2b,\nc^7 = a^2b(ab) = a^3b^2,\nc^8 = a^3b^2(ab) = a^4b^3 = b^3,\nc^9 = b^3(ab) = b^4a,\nc^{10} = b^4a(ab) = b^5a^2 = a^2,\nc^{11} = a^2(ab) = a^3b,\nc^{12} = a^3b(ab) = a^4b^2 = b^2,\nc^{13} = b^2(ab) = b^3a,\nc^{14} = b^3a(ab) = b^4a^2,\nc^{15} = b^4a^2(ab) = b^5a^3 = a^3,\nc^{16} = a^3(ab) = a^4b = b,\nc^{17} = b(ab) = ba,\nc^{18} = ba(ab) = b^2a^2,\nc^{19} = b^2a^2(ab) = b^3a^3,\nc^{20} = b^3a^3(ab) = b^4a^4 = e.\n\nWe can see that c has order 20, as none of the powers of c from 1 to 19 are equal to the identity element e. Therefore, G is a cyclic group generated by c and isomorphic to C20.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when G is not cyclic. Since |G| = 20 = 2^2 * 5, G must have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, say N, of order 5. Since G/N has order 4, it is either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If G/N is isomorphic to C4, then G is a semidirect product of N and K, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nIf G/N is isomorphic to V4, then G is a semidirect product of N and K, and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20, which is a semidirect product of C5 and V4.\n\nIn conclusion, the given group G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20."
