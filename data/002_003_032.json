    "message_1": "A cube has an edge length of 5cm. What is the total surface area of the cube?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of a cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe area of a square is found by multiplying the length of one side by itself. In this case, the edge length of the cube is 5 cm, so the area of one face is 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 square centimeters.\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube: 25 square centimeters × 6 = 150 square centimeters.\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
