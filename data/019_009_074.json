    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem based on Intuitionistic Logic:\n\nSuppose we have `6` axioms and `3` rules of inference for a particular Intuitionistic Logic system. How many different ways can we generate a valid proof of a theorem using exactly `4` applications of these axioms and rules of inference?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of different ways to apply the 6 axioms and 3 rules of inference in 4 steps. In each step, we have 9 choices (6 axioms + 3 rules of inference). Since we have 4 steps, the total number of ways to generate a valid proof is:\n\n9 * 9 * 9 * 9 = 6561\n\nSo, there are 6561 different ways to generate a valid proof of a theorem using exactly 4 applications of these axioms and rules of inference. However, it's important to note that not all of these combinations will necessarily lead to a valid proof, as some may not follow the correct logical structure."
