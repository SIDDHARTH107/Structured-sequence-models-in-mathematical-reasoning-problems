If we select 75 people at random, what is the probability that:\na) Exactly 10 people have the medical condition?\nb) At least 20 people have the medical condition? \nc) More than 15 people but no more than 25 people have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve these problems. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, people with the medical condition)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.23)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 75 people)\n- k is the number of successes\n\na) Exactly 10 people have the medical condition:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(75, 10) * 0.23^10 * (1-0.23)^(75-10)\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.0103\n\nb) At least 20 people have the medical condition:\n\nWe can find the probability of having less than 20 people with the medical condition and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability of having at least 20 people with the condition.\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20)\n\nP(X ≥ 20) ≈ 1 - 0.9525 = 0.0475\n\nc) More than 15 people but no more than 25 people have the medical condition:\n\nWe can find the probability of having between 16 and 25 people with the medical condition by summing the probabilities for each value of k.\n\nP(16 ≤ X ≤ 25) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 16 to 25\n\nP(16 ≤ X ≤ 25) ≈ 0.6799"
