    "message_2": "A heptagon has 7 sides. Since it is a regular polygon, all sides have the same length. To find the perimeter, we simply multiply the side length by the number of sides:\n\nPerimeter = side length × number of sides\nPerimeter = 6 cm × 7\nPerimeter = 42 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular heptagon is 42 cm."
