    "message_1": "A company wants to classify their employees into two categories, those who are eligible for a promotion and those who are not. The company has collected data on the employees' annual salary and years of work experience. Using discriminant analysis, determine the cutoff value for annual salary and years of work experience that will correctly classify the employees into these two categories. The data set has 100 observations, out of which 60 employees are eligible for promotion and 40 employees are not.",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis and determine the cutoff values for annual salary and years of work experience, we need the actual data set containing the employees' annual salary and years of work experience. However, since the data set is not provided, we can only explain the general steps to perform discriminant analysis and find the cutoff values.\n\n1. Prepare the data: Organize the data set into a table with columns for employee ID, annual salary, years of work experience, and promotion eligibility (1 for eligible, 0 for not eligible).\n\n2. Calculate the group means: Compute the mean annual salary and mean years of work experience for both the promotion-eligible group and the not-eligible group.\n\n3. Calculate the within-group covariance matrix: Compute the covariance matrix for each group (promotion-eligible and not-eligible) separately, and then calculate the weighted average of these two covariance matrices.\n\n4. Calculate the between-group covariance matrix: Compute the difference between the group means and the overall mean, and then calculate the outer product of this difference. Multiply this outer product by the number of observations in each group and sum the results.\n\n5. Compute the linear discriminant function: Calculate the inverse of the within-group covariance matrix and multiply it by the difference between the group means. This will give you the linear discriminant function coefficients.\n\n6. Calculate the cutoff value: Compute the linear discriminant scores for each observation in the data set using the linear discriminant function coefficients. Then, find the value that best separates the two groups (promotion-eligible and not-eligible) by minimizing the misclassification rate.\n\n7. Interpret the results: The cutoff values for annual salary and years of work experience will be the values that best separate the two groups based on the linear discriminant scores. Employees with scores above the cutoff value will be classified as promotion-eligible, while those with scores below the cutoff value will be classified as not-eligible.\n\nPlease provide the data set to perform the discriminant analysis and determine the specific cutoff values for annual salary and years of work experience."
