    "message_2": "We will use the logistic equation to find the population at each time step until we reach P5.\n\nP0 = 0.2\n\nP1 = 3 * P0 * (1 - P0) = 3 * 0.2 * (1 - 0.2) = 3 * 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.48\n\nP2 = 3 * P1 * (1 - P1) = 3 * 0.48 * (1 - 0.48) = 3 * 0.48 * 0.52 = 0.7488\n\nP3 = 3 * P2 * (1 - P2) = 3 * 0.7488 * (1 - 0.7488) = 3 * 0.7488 * 0.2512 = 0.56452416\n\nP4 = 3 * P3 * (1 - P3) = 3 * 0.56452416 * (1 - 0.56452416) = 3 * 0.56452416 * 0.43547584 = 0.736824493312\n\nP5 = 3 * P4 * (1 - P4) = 3 * 0.736824493312 * (1 - 0.736824493312) = 3 * 0.736824493312 * 0.263175506688 â‰ˆ 0.580982\n\nSo, the population after 5 time steps, P5, is approximately 0.580982."
