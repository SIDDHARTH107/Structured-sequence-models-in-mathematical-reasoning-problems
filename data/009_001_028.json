    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(rt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, r is the constant of proportionality, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, P0 = 500, r = 0.02, and t = 5.\n\nP(5) = 500 * e^(0.02 * 5)\n\nP(5) = 500 * e^0.1\n\nP(5) ≈ 500 * 1.10517\n\nP(5) ≈ 552.585\n\nAfter 5 years, there will be approximately 553 sharks in the population."
