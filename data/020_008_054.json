The transportation cost per unit between cities is given in the following table: \n\n|  Cities | A | B | C | D |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A | - | 15 | 20 | 25 |\n| B | 15 | - | 20 | 30 |\n| C | 20 | 20 | - | 40 |\n| D | 25 | 30 | 40 | - |\n\nThe company has 100 units of product and wants to distribute it such that the transportation cost is minimized. Help the company by finding the optimal distribution plan.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the transportation cost, the company should distribute its products to the cities with the lowest transportation cost per unit. In this case, the lowest costs are between cities A and B, and cities A and C.\n\nLet's denote the number of units sent from city A to city B as x, and the number of units sent from city A to city C as y. Then, the total transportation cost can be represented as:\n\nCost = 15x + 20y\n\nSince the company has 100 units of product, we have the constraint:\n\nx + y = 100\n\nNow we need to minimize the cost function subject to the constraint. To do this, we can solve for y in the constraint equation:\n\ny = 100 - x\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into the cost function:\n\nCost = 15x + 20(100 - x)\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nCost = 15x + 2000 - 20x\n\nCost = -5x + 2000\n\nSince the cost function is a linear function with a negative slope, the minimum cost will occur at the endpoint of the constraint, which is when x = 100 and y = 0.\n\nSo, the optimal distribution plan is to send all 100 units from city A to city B, with a total transportation cost of 15 * 100 = 1500."
