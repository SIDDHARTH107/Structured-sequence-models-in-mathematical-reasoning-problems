    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Schwarz reflection principle and the properties of analytic functions.\n\nFirst, let's define a function $g(z)$ in the following way:\n\n$$\ng(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z), & \\text{if } \\mathrm{Im}(z) > 0 \\\\\n\\cos(\\pi z), & \\text{if } \\mathrm{Im}(z) = 0 \\\\\n\\overline{f(\\overline{z})}, & \\text{if } \\mathrm{Im}(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe know that $f(z)$ is analytic in the open upper half-plane, and $\\cos(\\pi z)$ is an entire function (i.e., analytic everywhere in the complex plane). Moreover, the function $f(\\overline{z})$ is analytic in the open lower half-plane, and its conjugate $\\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$ is also analytic in the open lower half-plane.\n\nNow, we need to show that $g(z)$ is continuous on the real axis. Since $\\lim_{z\\to x} (f(z)-\\cos(\\pi z)) = 0$ for all real $x$, we have that $f(z)$ and $\\cos(\\pi z)$ agree on the real axis, so $g(z)$ is continuous on the real axis.\n\nNext, we need to show that $g(z)$ is analytic in the open upper and lower half-planes. This is true by construction, as $g(z) = f(z)$ in the open upper half-plane and $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$ in the open lower half-plane.\n\nNow, we can apply the Schwarz reflection principle, which states that if a function is analytic in the open upper and lower half-planes and continuous on the real axis, then it can be extended to an entire function. Thus, $g(z)$ is an entire function.\n\nFinally, we need to find the limit of $g(z)$ as $y \\to +\\infty$ along the imaginary axis. We know that $\\lim_{y\\to +\\infty} f(iy) = i$. Since $g(z) = f(z)$ in the open upper half-plane, we have:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{y\\to +\\infty} g(iy) = \\lim_{y\\to +\\infty} f(iy) = i\n$$\n\nTherefore, the analytic function $f(z)$ that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\n$$\nf(z) = g(z) \\quad \\text{for } \\mathrm{Im}(z) > 0\n$$"
