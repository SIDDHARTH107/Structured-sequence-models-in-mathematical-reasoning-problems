    "message_2": "Determining the initial conditions that lead to a chaotic attractor in the Rössler system requires numerical simulations and cannot be solved analytically. However, I can provide you with a set of initial conditions that are known to lead to a chaotic attractor for the given parameter values.\n\nFor the Rössler system with $a = 0.15$, $b = 0.2$, and $c = 10$, a set of initial conditions that lead to a chaotic attractor is:\n\n$x(0) = -5.75$\n$y(0) = -1.6$\n$z(0) = 0.02$\n\nPlease note that these initial conditions are not unique, and other initial conditions may also lead to a chaotic attractor. Numerical simulations and exploration of the system's behavior can help identify other such initial conditions."
