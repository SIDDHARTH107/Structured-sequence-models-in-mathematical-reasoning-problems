    "message_2": "To find the Hamiltonian vector field Xf for the function f(x) = x1^2 - x2^2, we first compute the differential df:\n\ndf = ∂f/∂x1 dx1 + ∂f/∂x2 dx2 + ∂f/∂y1 dy1 + ∂f/∂y2 dy2\n   = (2x1 dx1 - 2x2 dx2)\n\nNow, we need to find a vector field Xf such that ω(Xf, ·) = df. In other words, we need to find a vector field Xf = A ∂/∂x1 + B ∂/∂y1 + C ∂/∂x2 + D ∂/∂y2 such that:\n\ndx1 ∧ dy1 (Xf, ·) + dx2 ∧ dy2 (Xf, ·) = 2x1 dx1 - 2x2 dx2\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get:\n\nA = 0\nB = 2x1\nC = 0\nD = -2x2\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian vector field Xf is given by:\n\nXf = 2x1 ∂/∂y1 - 2x2 ∂/∂y2\n\nNow, we need to compute the flow ϕt of Xf through the point (1,0,0,1) at time t=π/2. The flow is given by the solution of the following system of ordinary differential equations:\n\ndx1/dt = 0\ndy1/dt = 2x1\ndx2/dt = 0\ndy2/dt = -2x2\n\nwith initial conditions x1(0) = 1, y1(0) = 0, x2(0) = 0, and y2(0) = 1.\n\nThe first and third equations imply that x1(t) = 1 and x2(t) = 0 for all t. The second and fourth equations become:\n\ndy1/dt = 2\ndy2/dt = 0\n\nIntegrating these equations, we get:\n\ny1(t) = 2t + C1\ny2(t) = C2\n\nUsing the initial conditions, we find C1 = 0 and C2 = 1. Thus, the flow ϕt is given by:\n\nϕt(x1, y1, x2, y2) = (1, 2t, 0, 1)\n\nFinally, we compute the flow at time t=π/2:\n\nϕ(π/2) = (1, π, 0, 1)"
