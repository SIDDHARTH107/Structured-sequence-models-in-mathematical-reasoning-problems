    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total Gaussian curvature of a surface to its topological properties. For a compact surface S with boundary ∂S, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem states:\n\n∫∫_S K dA + ∫_∂S k_g ds = 2πχ(S),\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, k_g is the geodesic curvature, dA is the area element, ds is the arc length element, and χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nIn this case, S is part of a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, and its boundary is a circle of radius 5 in the xy-plane. Since the sphere is a smooth surface, the geodesic curvature k_g along the boundary circle is 0. The Euler characteristic χ(S) of a sphere is 2.\n\nThe Gaussian curvature K of a sphere with radius R is given by K = 1/R^2. In this case, R = 5, so K = 1/25.\n\nNow we need to find the area of the surface S. Since S is bounded by a circle of radius 5 in the xy-plane, it is a spherical cap. The height h of the spherical cap can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nh^2 + 5^2 = R^2,\nh^2 + 25 = 25^2,\nh^2 = 625 - 25,\nh = √600.\n\nThe area A of the spherical cap is given by A = 2πRh. In this case, A = 2π(5)(√600).\n\nNow we can apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n∫∫_S K dA + ∫_∂S k_g ds = 2πχ(S),\n(1/25) * 2π(5)(√600) = 2π(2).\n\nSolving for the total Gaussian curvature, we get:\n\n(1/25) * 2π(5)(√600) = 4π.\n\nThus, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for the surface S is:\n\n4π = 4π."
