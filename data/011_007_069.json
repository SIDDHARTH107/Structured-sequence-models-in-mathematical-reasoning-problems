    "message_2": "Let f(n) be the number of ways to climb the staircase with n steps. When you are at the first step, you have 1 way to climb (taking 1 step). When you are at the second step, you have 2 ways to climb (taking 1 step twice or taking 2 steps at once). \n\nFor any step n > 2, you can reach it either by taking 1 step from the (n-1)th step or by taking 2 steps from the (n-2)th step. Therefore, the number of ways to climb n steps is the sum of the number of ways to climb (n-1) steps and (n-2) steps.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation for this problem is:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)\n\nwith initial conditions:\n\nf(1) = 1\nf(2) = 2"
