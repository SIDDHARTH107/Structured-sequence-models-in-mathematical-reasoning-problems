    "message_2": "To calculate the price of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to first find the values of d1 and d2, which are given by the following formulas:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price\nK = strike price\nr = risk-free interest rate\nσ = volatility\nT = time to maturity\n\nIn this problem, we are not given the current stock price (S). However, we can still express the call option price in terms of S using the Black-Scholes equation:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nwhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n\nK = 50\nσ = 0.2\nr = 0.05\nT = 1\n\nd1 = (ln(S/50) + (0.05 + (0.2^2)/2) * 1) / (0.2 * sqrt(1))\nd2 = d1 - 0.2 * sqrt(1)\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - 50 * e^(-0.05 * 1) * N(d2)\n\nThis is the Black-Scholes equation for the price of the European call option in terms of the current stock price (S). To find the exact price of the call option, we would need the value of S."
