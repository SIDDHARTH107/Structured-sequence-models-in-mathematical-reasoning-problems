    "message_2": "To prove that the group G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will first analyze the structure of G using the given multiplication table. We will then compare this structure to the structures of C12, A4, and D6 to determine which group G is isomorphic to.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the structure of G\n- G has 12 elements, which is consistent with the orders of C12, A4, and D6.\n- The identity element of G is 'a', as seen in the first row and column of the table.\n- The inverse of each element in G can be found in the table. For example, the inverse of 'b' is itself, the inverse of 'c' is 'k', and so on.\n\nStep 2: Compare G to C12\n- C12 is a cyclic group, meaning that it can be generated by a single element. To check if G is isomorphic to C12, we need to find an element in G that generates the entire group when raised to different powers.\n- By examining the multiplication table, we can see that no single element generates the entire group. For example, the powers of 'b' only generate {a, b, e, f, c, d, k, l}, and the powers of 'c' only generate {a, c, d, i, k, l}.\n- Since no single element generates the entire group, G is not isomorphic to C12.\n\nStep 3: Compare G to A4\n- A4 is the alternating group on 4 elements, which is a subgroup of the symmetric group S4. A4 consists of all even permutations of 4 elements and has 12 elements in total.\n- To check if G is isomorphic to A4, we can look for a subgroup of G that is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group (V4), which is a characteristic subgroup of A4.\n- The elements {a, e, j, l} form a subgroup of G that is isomorphic to V4, as their multiplication table is consistent with the Klein 4-group.\n- Additionally, the elements {a, c, d, i, k, l} form a subgroup of G that is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6, which is another characteristic subgroup of A4.\n- Since G contains subgroups isomorphic to both V4 and C6, G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nStep 4: Compare G to D6\n- D6 is the dihedral group of order 12, which consists of the symmetries of a regular hexagon, including rotations and reflections.\n- While G does have some elements that resemble rotations (e.g., {a, c, d, i, k, l}) and reflections (e.g., {a, b, e, f, g, h, j, k}), the overall structure of G does not match the structure of D6.\n- Therefore, G is not isomorphic to D6.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on our analysis, the group G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4."
