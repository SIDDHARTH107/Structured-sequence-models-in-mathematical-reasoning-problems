    "message_1": "A travel agency offers a group tour for a wildlife safari. They say that the probability of spotting at least one lion during the tour is 0.65. If a group of 8 tourists join the safari tour, what is the probability that all of them see at least one lion during the trip?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that the probability of each tourist spotting at least one lion is independent of the others. In this case, we can simply multiply the probabilities for each tourist.\n\nThe probability of each tourist spotting at least one lion is 0.65. Since there are 8 tourists, we need to multiply this probability 8 times:\n\nP(all 8 tourists see at least one lion) = 0.65 × 0.65 × 0.65 × 0.65 × 0.65 × 0.65 × 0.65 × 0.65 = 0.65^8\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\n0.65^8 ≈ 0.037\n\nSo, the probability that all 8 tourists see at least one lion during the trip is approximately 0.037 or 3.7%."
