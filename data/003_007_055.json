    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we will use the Law of Cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 15 in this case. Let's denote the sides as a = 10, b = 12, and c = 15, and the angles opposite these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. We want to find angle C.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n15² = 10² + 12² - 2 * 10 * 12 * cos(C)\n\n225 = 100 + 144 - 240 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we will solve for cos(C):\n\n81 = -240 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = -81/240\n\nNow, we will find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine:\n\nC = arccos(-81/240)\n\nC ≈ 106.26°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 106.26°."
