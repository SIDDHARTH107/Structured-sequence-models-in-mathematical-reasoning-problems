    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. A simple connected graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges has more edges than a tree (which would have 9 edges), so it must contain at least one cycle.\n\nLet's use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 18 = 36.\n\nNow, let's consider the best-case scenario for minimizing the girth, which is when the graph is a complete graph (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In a complete graph with 10 vertices, each vertex has a degree of 9, and the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 10 * 9 = 90. However, this is much larger than the 36 we have, so our graph is not a complete graph.\n\nNext, let's consider a graph with a girth of 3 (i.e., a triangle). In this case, we can have a triangle with 3 vertices and 3 edges, and then connect the remaining 7 vertices to one of the vertices of the triangle. This would result in a graph with 10 vertices and 3 + 7 = 10 edges. However, this is still less than the 18 edges we have.\n\nNow, let's consider a graph with a girth of 4 (i.e., a square). We can have a square with 4 vertices and 4 edges, and then connect the remaining 6 vertices to two opposite vertices of the square. This would result in a graph with 10 vertices and 4 + 6 * 2 = 16 edges. This is still less than the 18 edges we have.\n\nFinally, let's consider a graph with a girth of 5 (i.e., a pentagon). We can have a pentagon with 5 vertices and 5 edges, and then connect the remaining 5 vertices to one of the vertices of the pentagon. This would result in a graph with 10 vertices and 5 + 5 = 10 edges. However, this is still less than the 18 edges we have.\n\nSince we cannot find a graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges that has a girth less than 5, the girth of the graph must be at least 5."
