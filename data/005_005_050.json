    "message_1": "Consider a dice with sides numbered from 1 to 6. If you roll the dice 100 times, what is the probability that the number 4 appears exactly 20 times?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 100 (rolling the dice 100 times)\n- k = 20 (wanting the number 4 to appear exactly 20 times)\n- p = 1/6 (the probability of rolling a 4 on a single roll, since there are 6 sides on the dice)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k) = C(100, 20):\n\nC(100, 20) = 100! / (20! * (100-20)!)\nC(100, 20) = 100! / (20! * 80!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X=20) = C(100, 20) * (1/6)^20 * (5/6)^80\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nC(100, 20) ≈ 5.3593 * 10^20\n(1/6)^20 ≈ 2.86797 * 10^-16\n(5/6)^80 ≈ 1.80485 * 10^-3\n\nNow, multiply these values together:\n\nP(X=20) ≈ 5.3593 * 10^20 * 2.86797 * 10^-16 * 1.80485 * 10^-3\nP(X=20) ≈ 0.02696\n\nSo, the probability of rolling the number 4 exactly 20 times in 100 rolls is approximately 0.02696 or 2.696%."
