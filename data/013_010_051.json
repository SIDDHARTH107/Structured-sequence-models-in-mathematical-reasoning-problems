    "message_1": "In a Cournot duopoly, firm A has the following demand function: P(Q) = 100 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the output. Firm B also has the same demand function. However, both firms have a constant marginal cost of $20 per unit. Determine the output levels and profits for both firms in the Nash equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "In a Cournot duopoly, each firm chooses its output level to maximize its profit, taking the output level of the other firm as given. Let qA and qB be the output levels of firm A and firm B, respectively. The total output in the market is Q = qA + qB. \n\nThe demand function for the market is P(Q) = 100 - Q, so the revenue function for firm A is R_A(qA) = P(Q) * qA = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qA. \n\nFirm A's cost function is C_A(qA) = 20 * qA, since the marginal cost is constant at $20 per unit. \n\nFirm A's profit function is π_A(qA) = R_A(qA) - C_A(qA) = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qA - 20 * qA.\n\nTo find the output level that maximizes firm A's profit, we take the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to qA and set it equal to zero:\n\ndπ_A(qA)/dqA = (100 - (qA + qB)) - 2qA - 20 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for firm B, the profit function is π_B(qB) = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qB - 20 * qB.\n\nTaking the first-order derivative with respect to qB and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndπ_B(qB)/dqB = (100 - (qA + qB)) - 2qB - 20 = 0.\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns:\n\n1) 80 - qA - 2qB = 0\n2) 80 - 2qA - qB = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nFrom equation 1, qA = 80 - 2qB\nSubstituting this into equation 2:\n\n80 - 2(80 - 2qB) - qB = 0\n80 - 160 + 4qB - qB = 0\n3qB = 80\nqB = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nNow, substituting qB back into the equation for qA:\n\nqA = 80 - 2(80/3) ≈ 80 - 53.33 ≈ 26.67\n\nSo, in the Nash equilibrium, both firms produce approximately 26.67 units of output.\n\nTo find the profits for each firm, we can plug these output levels back into their respective profit functions:\n\nπ_A(26.67) = (100 - (26.67 + 26.67)) * 26.67 - 20 * 26.67 ≈ 46.67 * 26.67 - 20 * 26.67 ≈ 26.67 * 26.67\n\nπ_A ≈ 711.11\n\nSimilarly, for firm B:\n\nπ_B(26.67) = (100 - (26.67 + 26.67)) * 26.67 - 20 * 26.67 ≈ 46.67 * 26.67 - 20 * 26.67 ≈ 26.67 * 26.67\n\nπ_B ≈ 711.11\n\nIn the Nash equilibrium, both firms produce approximately 26.67 units of output and earn profits of approximately $711.11 each."
