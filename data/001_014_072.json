    "message_2": "To simplify the expression $\\sqrt{72}$, we can find the prime factorization of 72 and then simplify the square root using the product rule.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2$. So, we have:\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{2^3 \\cdot 3^2}$\n\nUsing the product rule for square roots, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{2^3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2}$\n\nSince $\\sqrt{2^3}$ contains an exponent that is not divisible by 2, we cannot simplify it further. However, $\\sqrt{3^2}$ simplifies to 3 because the square root of a number squared is the number itself.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is:\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 3$\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$"
