    "message_2": "To find the minimum weight spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum weight spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree.\n4. Continue adding edges until the tree has (number of vertices - 1) edges.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Sort the edges in non-decreasing order of their weights:\n\nDE: 4\nAB: 5\nBC: 6\nDF: 7\nBD: 8\nCD: 9\nCE: 10\nEF: 11\nAC: 23\n\nStep 2: Start with an empty graph.\n\nStep 3: Add edges one by one, making sure not to form a cycle:\n\n- Add DE (weight 4)\n- Add AB (weight 5)\n- Add BC (weight 6)\n- Add DF (weight 7)\n- Skip BD (weight 8) as it would form a cycle (ABCD)\n- Skip CD (weight 9) as it would form a cycle (ABCD)\n- Add CE (weight 10)\n\nStep 4: We have added (6 - 1) = 5 edges to the tree.\n\nThe minimum weight spanning tree is:\n\nAB: 5\nBC: 6\nDE: 4\nDF: 7\nCE: 10\n\nThe total weight of the minimum weight spanning tree is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 + 10 = 32."
