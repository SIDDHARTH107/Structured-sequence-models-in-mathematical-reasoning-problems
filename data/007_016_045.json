    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. The prime number 2p + 1 is called a safe prime. We are looking for the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 13.\n\nLet's check the prime numbers greater than 13:\n\n- 17: 2(17) + 1 = 34 + 1 = 35 (not prime)\n- 19: 2(19) + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39 (not prime)\n- 23: 2(23) + 1 = 46 + 1 = 47 (prime)\n\n23 is a Sophie Germain prime because 2(23) + 1 = 47, which is also prime. Therefore, the smallest Sophie Germain prime number that follows the prime number 13 is 23."
