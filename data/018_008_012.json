    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as AxB, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nLet's find AxB and BxA:\n\nAxB = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nAxB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nBxA = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nBxA = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare AxB and BxA:\n\nAxB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nBxA = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, AxB and BxA are not equal, since the ordered pairs in each set are different. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
