We have data on 50 machines, and we know the time (in months) each machine functioned correctly before it failed. The data set is:\n            \n            24, 30, 31, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 47, 49, 51,\n            52, 53, 53, 54, 56, 58, 58, 59, 60, 60, 62, 62, 63, 64,\n            64, 65, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 72, 73, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77,\n            78, 78, 82, 85, 87, 91, 111.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected machine will fail after at least 50 months of operation?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected machine will fail after at least 50 months of operation, we first need to count the number of machines that failed after 50 months or more. \n\nFrom the given data set, we can see that the following machines failed after at least 50 months:\n\n51, 52, 53, 53, 54, 56, 58, 58, 59, 60, 60, 62, 62, 63, 64, 64, 65, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 72, 73, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 78, 82, 85, 87, 91, 111\n\nThere are a total of 37 machines that failed after at least 50 months.\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of machines that failed after at least 50 months by the total number of machines:\n\nProbability = (Number of machines that failed after at least 50 months) / (Total number of machines)\nProbability = 37 / 50\nProbability = 0.74\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected machine will fail after at least 50 months of operation is 0.74 or 74%."
