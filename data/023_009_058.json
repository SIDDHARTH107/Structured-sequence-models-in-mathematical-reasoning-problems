    "message_1": "A steel rod has a length of 2 meters with a fixed end at x=0 and a free end at x=2 meters. The temperature distribution along the rod is given by T(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5. What is the Fourier series for T(x) and what is the temperature at x=0.5 meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given temperature distribution T(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5, we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the given function is an even function (symmetric about the y-axis), we only need to find the a_n coefficients. The Fourier series for an even function is given by:\n\nT(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function. In this case, L = 2 meters (the length of the rod). The coefficients a_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[T(x) dx] from 0 to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[T(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 - 4x + 5) dx] from 0 to 2\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1/3)x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x] from 0 to 2\na_0 = (1/2) * [(8/3 - 8 + 10) - (0)]\na_0 = (1/2) * (2/3)\na_0 = 1/3\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 - 4x + 5) * cos(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let u = x^2 - 4x + 5 and dv = cos(nπx/2) dx. Then, du = (2x - 4) dx and v = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[u dv] = u*v - ∫[v du]\n\n∫[(x^2 - 4x + 5) * cos(nπx/2) dx] = (x^2 - 4x + 5) * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) - ∫[(2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) * (2x - 4) dx]\n\nNow, let u = 2x - 4 and dv = sin(nπx/2) dx. Then, du = 2 dx and v = (-4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2).\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\n∫[(2x - 4) * sin(nπx/2) dx] = (2x - 4) * (-4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2) - ∫[(-4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2) * 2 dx]\n\n∫[(2x - 4) * sin(nπx/2) dx] = (2x - 4) * (-4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2) + (8/n^2π^2) * ∫[cos(nπx/2) dx]\n\nNow, integrate cos(nπx/2) dx:\n\n∫[cos(nπx/2) dx] = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)\n\nSo,\n\n∫[(2x - 4) * sin(nπx/2) dx] = (2x - 4) * (-4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2) + (8/n^2π^2) * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for a_n:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(x^2 - 4x + 5) * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) - (2x - 4) * (-4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2) + (8/n^2π^2) * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)]\n\nEvaluate the integral from 0 to 2:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(4/nπ) * sin(nπ) - (8/n^2π^2) * cos(nπ) + (16/n^3π^3) * sin(nπ)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(nπ) = (-1)^n, we have:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [0 - (8/n^2π^2) * (-1)^n + 0]\na_n = (4/n^2π^2) * (-1)^n\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series for T(x):\n\nT(x) = 1/3 + Σ [(4/n^2π^2) * (-1)^n * cos(nπx/2)]\n\nTo find the temperature at x = 0.5 meters, plug x = 0.5 into the Fourier series:\n\nT(0.5) = 1/3 + Σ [(4/n^2π^2) * (-1)^n * cos(nπ(0.5)/2)]\n\nT(0.5) = 1/3 + Σ [(4/n^2π^2) * (-1)^n * cos(nπ/4)]\n\nThe Fourier series converges to the given temperature distribution function. To get an approximate value for the temperature at x = 0.5 meters, we can sum a few terms of the series. However, the exact temperature at x = 0.5 meters can be found using the original function:\n\nT(0.5) = (0.5)^2 - 4(0.5) + 5\nT(0.5) = 0.25 - 2 + 5\nT(0.5) = 3.25\n\nSo, the temperature at x = 0.5 meters is approximately 3.25°C."
