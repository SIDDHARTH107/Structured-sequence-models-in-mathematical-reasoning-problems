    "message_2": "To solve the given complex differential equation, we first rewrite it as a first-order linear differential equation:\n\n$$(z^2+1)\\frac{dz}{dt}+4z = 4t$$\n\nNow, we look for an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of $z$ with respect to $t$. In this case, the coefficient of $z$ is $\\frac{4}{z^2+1}$. So, we have:\n\n$$\\text{Integrating Factor} = e^{\\int \\frac{4}{z^2+1} dt}$$\n\nTo find the integral, we first need to express it in terms of $z$. We can do this by using the substitution $z = \\tan(u)$, which implies that $dz = (\\sec^2(u)) du$. Thus, the integral becomes:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{4}{z^2+1} dt = \\int \\frac{4}{\\tan^2(u)+1} (\\sec^2(u)) du = 4\\int du = 4u + C$$\n\nNow, we can find the integrating factor:\n\n$$\\text{Integrating Factor} = e^{4u+C} = e^{4u}e^C$$\n\nSince we are only interested in the form of the integrating factor, we can ignore the constant $e^C$ and consider the integrating factor as $e^{4u}$. Now, we can rewrite the differential equation with the integrating factor:\n\n$$e^{4u}(z^2+1)\\frac{dz}{dt} + 4ze^{4u} = 4te^{4u}$$\n\nNow, we can notice that the left-hand side is the derivative of the product of $z$ and the integrating factor with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(ze^{4u}) = 4te^{4u}$$\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{d}{dt}(ze^{4u}) dt = \\int 4te^{4u} dt$$\n\n$$ze^{4u} = e^{4u} \\int 4t dt = e^{4u}(2t^2 + C_1)$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $z$:\n\n$$z = \\frac{e^{4u}(2t^2 + C_1)}{e^{4u}} = 2t^2 + C_1$$\n\nNow, we need to find the constant $C_1$ using the initial condition $z(0) = -i$. Since $z = \\tan(u)$, we have:\n\n$$-i = \\tan(u_0)$$\n\n$$u_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - i\\ln(\\sqrt{1+(-1)^2}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition $z(0) = -i$:\n\n$$-i = 2(0)^2 + C_1$$\n\n$$C_1 = -i$$\n\nSo, the solution to the complex differential equation is:\n\n$$z(t) = 2t^2 - i$$"
