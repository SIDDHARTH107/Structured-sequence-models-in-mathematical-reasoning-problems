    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's label the six people A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nConsider person A. There are five other people at the party, so A must have at least three friends or three strangers among them (since 3 friends + 2 strangers = 5 or 2 friends + 3 strangers = 5).\n\nCase 1: A has three friends, say B, C, and D.\nIf any of B, C, or D are friends with each other, then we have a group of three mutual friends (A, B, C or A, B, D or A, C, D). If none of B, C, or D are friends with each other, then they form a group of three mutual strangers.\n\nCase 2: A has three strangers, say B, C, and D.\nIf any of B, C, or D are strangers to each other, then we have a group of three mutual strangers. If all of B, C, and D are friends with each other, then they form a group of three mutual friends.\n\nIn either case, we are guaranteed to have a group of three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. Now let's count the minimum number of friendships needed.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, we have the following friendships: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, and C-D. This is a total of 6 friendships. So, the minimum number of friendships needed to ensure that there are either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers is 6."
