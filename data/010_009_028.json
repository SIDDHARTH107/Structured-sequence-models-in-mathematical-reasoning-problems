    "message_2": "To subdivide the triangle ABC into 4 congruent triangles of equal area, we can find the midpoints of each side of the triangle and connect them.\n\nLet's find the midpoints of each side:\n\nMidpoint of AB: M1 = ((0+1)/2, (0+0)/2) = (0.5, 0)\nMidpoint of BC: M2 = ((1+0)/2, (0+1)/2) = (0.5, 0.5)\nMidpoint of AC: M3 = ((0+0)/2, (0+1)/2) = (0, 0.5)\n\nNow, connect the midpoints M1, M2, and M3 to form a smaller triangle M1M2M3 inside the triangle ABC. Then, connect each midpoint to the vertex opposite its side:\n\nM1 to C, M2 to A, and M3 to B.\n\nThis will create 4 congruent triangles: ΔAM2M3, ΔBM1M3, ΔCM1M2, and ΔM1M2M3. Each of these triangles has an area equal to 1/4 of the area of the original triangle ABC. This is a valid triangulation and subdivision of the triangle ABC into 4 congruent triangles of equal area."
