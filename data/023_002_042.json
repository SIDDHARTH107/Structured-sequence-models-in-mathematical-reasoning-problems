The Dirichlet's test states that if we have two sequences of real numbers {a_n} and {b_n} such that:\n\n1. The partial sums of {a_n} are bounded, i.e., there exists a constant M such that for all n, |A_n| = |a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n| ≤ M.\n2. The sequence {b_n} is monotonically decreasing and converges to 0.\n\nThen, the series ∑(a_n * b_n) converges.\n\nIn our case, let's consider a_n = sin(nx) and b_n = 1/n^2.\n\nFor a_n = sin(nx), we know that -1 ≤ sin(nx) ≤ 1 for all n and x. Therefore, the partial sums of a_n are bounded by -1 and 1.\n\nFor b_n = 1/n^2, we can see that it is a monotonically decreasing sequence as n increases, and it converges to 0 as n approaches infinity.\n\nSince both conditions of Dirichlet's test are satisfied, we can conclude that the given Fourier series converges at x = 1/2."
