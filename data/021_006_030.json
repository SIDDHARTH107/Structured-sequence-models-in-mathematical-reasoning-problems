    "message_1": "A math student is asked to solve the following partial differential equation using the finite element method: \n\nuₓₓ + uᵧᵧ = -5u\n\nwhere u is a function of x and y, and the domain of interest is a square with sides of length 1, i.e., Ω = [0,1] x [0,1]. Implement a finite element scheme and solve for the solution u on the mesh with h=0.1. What is the value of u at the point (0.5, 0.5) to two decimal places?",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the finite element method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain Ω into a mesh with a step size h=0.1.\n2. Define the basis functions and their derivatives.\n3. Formulate the weak form of the given PDE.\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector.\n5. Apply boundary conditions.\n6. Solve the linear system of equations.\n7. Interpolate the solution at the desired point (0.5, 0.5).\n\nSince the implementation of the finite element method requires a significant amount of coding and computation, it is not feasible to provide the full implementation and solution here. However, you can use existing finite element libraries like FEniCS, deal.II, or FreeFEM to implement the finite element scheme and solve the problem.\n\nOnce you have implemented the finite element scheme and solved for the solution u, you can interpolate the solution at the point (0.5, 0.5) to obtain the value of u at that point. The result will be a numerical approximation, and you can round it to two decimal places."
