    "message_2": "To determine the number of sheets of the covering map f, we need to analyze the fundamental groups of both the torus X and the circle Y.\n\nThe fundamental group of the circle Y, denoted as pi_1(Y), is isomorphic to the integers Z, i.e., pi_1(Y) ≅ Z. This is because any loop on the circle can be represented by an integer, which corresponds to the number of times the loop winds around the circle.\n\nThe fundamental group of the torus X, denoted as pi_1(X), is isomorphic to the direct product of two copies of the integers, i.e., pi_1(X) ≅ Z x Z. This is because a torus has two independent loops (one going around the \"hole\" and one going around the \"body\" of the torus), and each loop can be represented by an integer.\n\nNow, we are given that the induced map f*: pi_1(Y) -> pi_1(X) is an isomorphism. This means that f* maps the fundamental group of Y onto the fundamental group of X in a bijective manner, preserving the group structure.\n\nSince pi_1(Y) ≅ Z and pi_1(X) ≅ Z x Z, the isomorphism f* implies that Z must be isomorphic to Z x Z. However, this is not possible, as Z x Z has a more complex structure than Z, and they are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, there is a contradiction in the problem statement, and the given conditions cannot be satisfied. As a result, there is no covering map f with the specified properties, and the number of sheets of the covering map f cannot be determined."
