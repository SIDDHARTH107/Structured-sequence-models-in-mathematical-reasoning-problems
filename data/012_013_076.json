    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of G, we will use the deletion-contraction method. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of G with k colors. We will first delete an edge and then contract it, and find the chromatic polynomial for each case.\n\nLet's choose the edge (1, 2) for deletion and contraction.\n\n1. Deletion: Remove the edge (1, 2) from G. The resulting graph G' has edges {(2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5)}. G' is a cycle of length 4 with an additional vertex connected to one of the vertices in the cycle. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length n is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n * (k-1) if n is even, and (k-1)^n - (k-1) if n is odd. In this case, the chromatic polynomial of the cycle of length 4 is (k-1)^4 + (k-1). Since vertex 5 is connected to vertex 1, it can have (k-1) colors. So, the chromatic polynomial of G' is P(G', k) = ((k-1)^4 + (k-1)) * (k-1).\n\n2. Contraction: Contract the edge (1, 2) in G. The resulting graph G'' has vertices {1, 3, 4, 5} and edges {(1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5)}. G'' is a cycle of length 3 with an additional vertex connected to one of the vertices in the cycle. The chromatic polynomial of the cycle of length 3 is (k-1)^3 - (k-1). Since vertex 5 is connected to vertex 1, it can have (k-1) colors. So, the chromatic polynomial of G'' is P(G'', k) = ((k-1)^3 - (k-1)) * (k-1).\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k).\n\nP(G, k) = (((k-1)^4 + (k-1)) * (k-1)) - (((k-1)^3 - (k-1)) * (k-1))\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^5 + (k-1)^2 - (k-1)^4 + (k-1)^2\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^2 * ((k-1)^3 - (k-1)^2 + 1)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = (k-1)^2 * ((k-1)^3 - (k-1)^2 + 1)."
