    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it's not possible to provide a precise numerical problem related to Deontic Logic as it deals with ethical concepts and normative reasoning, rather than quantitative mathematics. Deontic logic involves expressing moral concepts such as permission, obligation, and prohibition using logical symbols and reasoning. \n\nInstead, here's a sample question related to deontic logic that a math student could attempt to solve:\n\n\"Consider the following statement: 'It is morally obligatory to help a stranger in need.' Using deontic logic, create a formal expression to represent this statement and demonstrate how you would derive the conclusion that failing to help a stranger in need is morally prohibited.\"",
    "message_2": "To represent the statement \"It is morally obligatory to help a stranger in need\" in deontic logic, we can use the following formal expression:\n\nO(H)\n\nHere, O represents the deontic operator for \"obligation,\" and H represents the action of \"helping a stranger in need.\"\n\nTo derive the conclusion that failing to help a stranger in need is morally prohibited, we can use the fact that in deontic logic, the prohibition of an action is equivalent to the obligation of its negation. In other words, if it is obligatory to perform an action, then it is prohibited not to perform that action.\n\nSo, if O(H) is true, then it is morally obligatory to help a stranger in need. The negation of H, which we can represent as ¬H, means \"not helping a stranger in need.\" Since it is obligatory to help a stranger in need, it is prohibited not to help a stranger in need. We can represent this prohibition using the deontic operator for \"prohibition,\" P:\n\nP(¬H)\n\nThus, we have derived the conclusion that failing to help a stranger in need is morally prohibited."
