    "message_1": "Let X be a complex projective variety of dimension 3 and Y be a complex projective subvariety of X of dimension 2. Suppose that the intersection of Y with any irreducible component of X has pure codimension 1 in the component. Show that the Poincaré polynomial of the intersection cohomology complex of Y is given by:\n\nP_k(Y) = [(k+4)(k+2)] / 2, for all k>=0. \n\nCalculate P_2(Y) using this formula.",
    "message_2": "To find the Poincaré polynomial P_k(Y) for k = 2, we can plug k = 2 into the given formula:\n\nP_2(Y) = [(2+4)(2+2)] / 2\n\nP_2(Y) = [(6)(4)] / 2\n\nP_2(Y) = 24 / 2\n\nP_2(Y) = 12\n\nSo, P_2(Y) = 12."
