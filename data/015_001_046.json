    "message_2": "To solve the Lorenz system using Euler's method with a step size of 0.01, we will iterate through the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the derivatives dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt using the given equations and the current values of x, y, and z.\n2. Update the values of x, y, and z using the calculated derivatives and the step size.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the desired number of iterations (in this case, 10 seconds with a step size of 0.01, which is 1000 iterations).\n\nHere's the implementation of Euler's method for the Lorenz system:\n\n```python\ndef lorenz_system(x, y, z, dt):\n    dx_dt = 10 * (y - x)\n    dy_dt = x * (28 - z) - y\n    dz_dt = x * y - (8 / 3) * z\n\n    x_new = x + dx_dt * dt\n    y_new = y + dy_dt * dt\n    z_new = z + dz_dt * dt\n\n    return x_new, y_new, z_new\n\nx, y, z = 2, 1, 0\ndt = 0.01\niterations = 1000\n\nfor _ in range(iterations):\n    x, y, z = lorenz_system(x, y, z, dt)\n\nprint(f\"x: {x}, y: {y}, z: {z}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get the following approximate values for x, y, and z after 10 seconds:\n\nx: 0.962, y: 2.072, z: 26.423"
