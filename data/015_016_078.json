    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent value of the Chua circuit system, we need to numerically solve the given set of differential equations and calculate the Lyapunov exponents. This is a complex task that requires specialized numerical methods and software, such as the Wolf method or Rosenstein's algorithm, which are beyond the scope of this platform.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a general idea of how to proceed:\n\n1. Define the Chua circuit system with the given differential equations and parameters.\n2. Implement a numerical integration method (e.g., Runge-Kutta) to solve the system of equations over the specified time period (1000 seconds) with the given initial conditions.\n3. Calculate the maximum Lyapunov exponent using a suitable algorithm (e.g., Wolf method or Rosenstein's algorithm).\n\nTo perform these steps, you may use programming languages like Python or MATLAB, which have libraries and toolboxes for solving differential equations and calculating Lyapunov exponents."
