    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 4x + 3 > 15, we will first isolate the variable x by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality:\n   4x + 3 - 3 > 15 - 3\n   4x > 12\n\n2. Divide both sides of the inequality by 4:\n   4x/4 > 12/4\n   x > 3\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x > 3.\n\nTo graph the solution on the number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from 0 to 6 (or more if you prefer).\n2. Locate the number 3 on the number line.\n3. Since the inequality is x > 3 (and not x â‰¥ 3), we will place an open circle at 3 to indicate that 3 is not included in the solution.\n4. Shade the number line to the right of the open circle at 3, indicating that all numbers greater than 3 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph of the solution on the number line will have an open circle at 3 and shaded to the right, representing all numbers greater than 3."
