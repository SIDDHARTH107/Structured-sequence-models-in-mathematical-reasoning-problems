    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 10, which is 2 * 5, where 2 and 5 are prime numbers. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exist Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups in G.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G and Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Then, |P| = 2 and |Q| = 5. Since 2 and 5 are prime, P and Q are cyclic, so P ≅ C2 and Q ≅ C5.\n\nNow, we consider the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_5 divides 2 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5, and n_5 = 1 or n_5 = 2.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup (P) and one Sylow 5-subgroup (Q) in G. Since both P and Q are normal in G, we can use the internal direct product theorem to conclude that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C2 × C5 ≅ C10. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup (Q) in G, so Q is normal in G. However, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups (P) in G. Let x be an element of order 2 in G, and y be an element of order 5 in G. Then, we can express any element of G as a product of powers of x and y, i.e., g = x^i * y^j for some i, j.\n\nSince Q is normal in G, we have xyx^(-1)y^(-1) ∈ Q for all x ∈ P and y ∈ Q. Let z = xyx^(-1)y^(-1). Then, z^5 = (xyx^(-1)y^(-1))^5 = (xyx^(-1)y^(-1)y^5) = (xyx^(-1)) ∈ Q. Since z^5 ∈ Q and |Q| = 5, either z = e (the identity element) or z has order 5.\n\nIf z = e, then xyx^(-1) = y, which implies that G is abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C2 × C5 ≅ C10.\n\nIf z has order 5, then G is non-abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, which has order 10.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or a non-abelian group of order 10."
