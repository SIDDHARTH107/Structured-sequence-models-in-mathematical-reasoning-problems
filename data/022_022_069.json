    "message_2": "First, let's find the first and second derivatives of f(x):\n\nf(x) = e^(6x-3)\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [e^(6x-3)]\nf'(x) = 6e^(6x-3)\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 [e^(6x-3)]\nf''(x) = 36e^(6x-3)\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier series of f(x). Since f(x) is not a periodic function, we will use the Fourier transform instead of the Fourier series. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(w) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[f(x) * e^(-iwx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nHowever, our function is defined only on the range [0, π]. To find the Fourier transform, we will extend the function to be zero outside this range. So, we have:\n\nF(w) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[e^(6x-3) * e^(-iwx)] dx, from 0 to π\n\nNow, let's integrate:\n\nF(w) = (1/√(2π)) [∫(e^((6-iw)x-3) dx], from 0 to π\n\nTo integrate, we use substitution: let u = (6-iw)x - 3, then du = (6-iw)dx\n\nF(w) = (1/√(2π)) [(1/(6-iw)) ∫(e^u du)], from u(0) to u(π)\n\nF(w) = (1/√(2π)) [(1/(6-iw)) (e^u)], from u(0) to u(π)\n\nF(w) = (1/√(2π)) [(1/(6-iw)) (e^((6-iw)π - 3) - e^(-3))]\n\nNow, let's discuss the convergence of the Fourier transform. The function f(x) = e^(6x-3) is continuous and smooth on the range [0, π]. Since we have extended the function to be zero outside this range, it becomes piecewise continuous and smooth on the entire real line. Therefore, the Fourier transform F(w) converges for all w in the real line."
