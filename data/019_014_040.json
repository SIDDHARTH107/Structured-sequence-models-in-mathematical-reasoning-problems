    "message_2": "To prove that there exists no injective function f: ℕ → P(ℕ), we will use a proof by contradiction. We will assume that there exists an injective function f: ℕ → P(ℕ) and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that there exists an injective function f: ℕ → P(ℕ). This means that for every natural number n, f(n) is a unique subset of ℕ.\n\nNow, let's define a new set A as follows:\n\nA = {n ∈ ℕ | n ∉ f(n)}\n\nIn words, A is the set of all natural numbers n such that n is not an element of the set f(n).\n\nSince f is a function from ℕ to P(ℕ), and A is a subset of ℕ (as it only contains natural numbers), there must exist some natural number m such that f(m) = A.\n\nNow, we will consider two cases:\n\n1. m ∈ A\n2. m ∉ A\n\nCase 1: m ∈ A\nIf m ∈ A, then by the definition of A, m ∉ f(m). However, we assumed that f(m) = A, so this means that m ∉ A. This is a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: m ∉ A\nIf m ∉ A, then by the definition of A, m ∈ f(m). However, we assumed that f(m) = A, so this means that m ∈ A. This is a contradiction.\n\nIn both cases, we have reached a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that there exists an injective function f: ℕ → P(ℕ) must be false. Thus, we have proven that there exists no injective function f: ℕ → P(ℕ)."
