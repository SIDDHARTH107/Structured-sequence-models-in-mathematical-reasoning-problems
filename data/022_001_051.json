    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of f(z) = e^(z^2) along the path γ(t) = t + i t^2, we first need to express z in terms of t using the given path. We have:\n\nz(t) = t + i t^2\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for z into the function f(z):\n\nf(z(t)) = e^((t + i t^2)^2)\n\nExpanding the exponent, we get:\n\nf(z(t)) = e^(t^2 + 2it^3 - t^4)\n\nNow, we want to find the value of f(1) obtained via this analytic continuation. To do this, we simply evaluate f(z(t)) at t = 1:\n\nf(z(1)) = e^((1 + i)^2) = e^(1 + 2i - 1) = e^(2i)\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can express this complex exponential in terms of trigonometric functions:\n\ne^(2i) = cos(2) + i sin(2)\n\nSo, the value of f(1) obtained via this analytic continuation is:\n\nf(1) = cos(2) + i sin(2)"
