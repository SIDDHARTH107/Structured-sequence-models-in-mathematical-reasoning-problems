    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of the space obtained by attaching a Möbius strip to a circle, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected subsets A and B, with path-connected intersection A ∩ B, then the fundamental group of X, π1(X), can be computed as the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, with amalgamation over their intersection:\n\nπ1(X) = π1(A) * π1(B) / N\n\nwhere N is the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form aba^(-1)b^(-1) for a in π1(A ∩ B) and b in π1(B ∩ A).\n\nLet X be the space obtained by attaching a Möbius strip M to a circle S^1. We can choose A to be an open neighborhood of the Möbius strip that includes the boundary circle, and B to be an open neighborhood of the circle S^1. Then, A ∩ B is an open annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1.\n\nNow, we compute the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B:\n\n1. The Möbius strip M is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1, so A is homotopy equivalent to S^1 as well. Thus, π1(A) = Z, the group of integers.\n\n2. The space B is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1, so π1(B) = Z.\n\n3. The intersection A ∩ B is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1, so π1(A ∩ B) = Z.\n\nNow, we apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem:\n\nπ1(X) = π1(A) * π1(B) / N = Z * Z / N\n\nTo compute the normal subgroup N, we need to find the element aba^(-1)b^(-1) for a in π1(A ∩ B) and b in π1(B ∩ A). Since both A and B are homotopy equivalent to a circle, their intersection A ∩ B is also homotopy equivalent to a circle. Therefore, the generator of π1(A ∩ B) can be represented by a loop that goes around the circle once. Let a = b = 1, representing the generator of Z. Then aba^(-1)b^(-1) = 1 * 1 * (-1) * (-1) = 1.\n\nThus, the normal subgroup N is generated by the identity element, and π1(X) = Z * Z / N = Z * Z. The fundamental group of the space obtained by attaching a Möbius strip to a circle is the free product of two copies of the integers, Z * Z."
