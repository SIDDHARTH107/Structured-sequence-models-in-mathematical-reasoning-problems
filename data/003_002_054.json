    "message_1": "If an angle in a right-angled triangle is 30 degrees and the length of the adjacent side is 4cm, what is the length of the opposite side?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the trigonometric function tangent (tan) which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle.\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this case, the angle is 30 degrees and the adjacent side is 4 cm. We want to find the length of the opposite side.\n\ntan(30) = opposite side / 4\n\nTo find the tangent of 30 degrees, we can use a calculator or recall the value from the trigonometric table:\n\ntan(30) = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the equation:\n\n0.577 = opposite side / 4\n\nTo find the length of the opposite side, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\nopposite side = 4 * 0.577\n\nopposite side ≈ 2.308 cm\n\nSo, the length of the opposite side is approximately 2.308 cm."
