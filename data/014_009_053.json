    "message_1": "Suppose you are using the Feistel cipher structure with 4 rounds to encrypt a message. Each round uses a 6-bit key and the plaintext and ciphertext both have a block size of 16 bits. If you have a 48-bit key, how many different keys are possible for this cipher?",
    "message_2": "Since the Feistel cipher uses a 48-bit key, and each bit can be either a 0 or a 1, there are 2^48 possible keys. To calculate this, simply raise 2 to the power of 48:\n\n2^48 = 281,474,976,710,656\n\nSo, there are 281,474,976,710,656 different keys possible for this cipher."
