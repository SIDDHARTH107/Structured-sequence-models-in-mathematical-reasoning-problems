    "message_1": "A student needs to find the period and amplitude of the function `f(x) = 3sin(2x)`. \n\nWhat is the period of `f(x)` and what is its amplitude?",
    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x), we need to analyze the equation.\n\nAmplitude: The amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 3. Therefore, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 2. The period of a basic sine function is 2π, so to find the period of f(x) = 3sin(2x), we divide the basic period by the coefficient of the x term: (2π) / 2 = π.\n\nSo, the amplitude of f(x) = 3sin(2x) is 3, and the period is π."
