    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the right triangle as follows: the hypotenuse is c, the side opposite the 30-degree angle is a, and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle is b.\n\nGiven: c = 10 cm, angle = 30 degrees\n\nWe can use the sine, cosine, and tangent functions to find the values of these trigonometric ratios for the 30-degree angle.\n\n1. Sine (sin):\nsin(30) = a/c\n\nWe know that sin(30) = 1/2 (from the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle or using a trigonometric table). Therefore:\n\n1/2 = a/10\na = 5 cm\n\n2. Cosine (cos):\ncos(30) = b/c\n\nWe know that cos(30) = √3/2 (from the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle or using a trigonometric table). Therefore:\n\n√3/2 = b/10\nb = 5√3 cm\n\n3. Tangent (tan):\ntan(30) = a/b\n\nWe know that tan(30) = 1/√3 (from the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle or using a trigonometric table). Therefore:\n\ntan(30) = 1/√3\n\nSo, the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for the 30-degree angle are:\n\nsin(30) = 1/2\ncos(30) = √3/2\ntan(30) = 1/√3"
