    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of a tornado occurring in a given year is 0.002, while the probability of a severe hailstorm is 0.01. What is the probability of either a tornado or a severe hailstorm occurring in that region in a given year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either a tornado or a severe hailstorm occurring in a given year, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of a tornado occurring, B is the event of a severe hailstorm occurring, and A ∩ B is the event of both a tornado and a severe hailstorm occurring.\n\nHowever, we don't have the information about the probability of both a tornado and a severe hailstorm occurring (P(A ∩ B)). We will assume that the events are independent, meaning the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event. In this case, the formula for the probability of the intersection of two independent events is:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)\n\nNow we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(A) = probability of a tornado occurring = 0.002\nP(B) = probability of a severe hailstorm occurring = 0.01\nP(A ∩ B) = probability of both a tornado and a severe hailstorm occurring = 0.002 × 0.01 = 0.00002\n\nNow we can find the probability of either a tornado or a severe hailstorm occurring:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.002 + 0.01 - 0.00002 = 0.01198\n\nSo, the probability of either a tornado or a severe hailstorm occurring in that region in a given year is 0.01198 or approximately 1.198%."
