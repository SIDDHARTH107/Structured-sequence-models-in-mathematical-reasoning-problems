    "message_2": "To prove that there is no finite sub-covering of this space, we will show that any open cover of X does not have a finite subcover. We will use the fact that X is a closed and bounded subset of the real numbers, and thus, it is compact.\n\nLet {U1, U2, …, Uk} be an arbitrary open cover of X. We will show that there exists an element x ∈ X that is not covered by any of the Ui's.\n\nConsider the sequence {1/n : n ∈ N}. Since X is compact, there exists a convergent subsequence {1/n_k} that converges to some limit point x ∈ X. Since 0 is the only limit point of X, we must have x = 0.\n\nNow, let ε > 0 be arbitrary. Since {1/n_k} converges to 0, there exists a positive integer K such that for all k ≥ K, we have |1/n_k - 0| < ε. In other words, for all k ≥ K, we have 1/n_k < ε.\n\nNow, let V = {x ∈ X : d(x, 0) < ε}. Since ε > 0, V is an open set containing 0. By the definition of an open cover, there must exist some Ui such that 0 ∈ Ui. Since Ui is open, there exists a δ > 0 such that the open ball B(0, δ) ⊆ Ui.\n\nLet N = max{K, ceil(1/δ)}. Then, for all n > N, we have 1/n < min{ε, δ}. In particular, 1/(N+1) ∈ B(0, δ) ⊆ Ui. However, since 1/(N+1) ∈ X and 1/(N+1) ≠ 0, we have found an element in X that is not covered by any of the Ui's.\n\nTherefore, there is no finite sub-covering of this space, as there always exists an element in X that is not covered by any of the Ui's."
