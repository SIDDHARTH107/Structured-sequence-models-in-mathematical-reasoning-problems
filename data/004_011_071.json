    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relationship between the volume of a sphere and its radius, as well as the concept of related rates in calculus.\n\nThe volume V of a sphere with radius r is given by the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nWe are given that the volume is increasing at a rate of 10 cm³/s, which can be represented as dV/dt = 10 cm³/s. We want to find the rate at which the radius is increasing, or dr/dt, when the volume is 100 cm³.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius when the volume is 100 cm³:\n\n100 = (4/3)πr³\n\nTo solve for r, we can first multiply both sides by 3/(4π):\n\n(3/4π)(100) = r³\n\nr³ = 75/π\n\nNow, take the cube root of both sides:\n\nr = (75/π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we will differentiate the volume formula with respect to time t to find the relationship between dV/dt and dr/dt:\n\ndV/dt = d((4/3)πr³)/dt\n\nSince (4/3)π is a constant, we can take it out of the derivative:\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π(d(r³)/dt)\n\nNow, we will use the chain rule to differentiate r³ with respect to t:\n\nd(r³)/dt = 3r²(dr/dt)\n\nSo, our equation becomes:\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π(3r²)(dr/dt)\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = 10 cm³/s, so we can plug that in and solve for dr/dt:\n\n10 = (4/3)π(3r²)(dr/dt)\n\nNow, we will plug in the value of r that we found earlier:\n\n10 = (4/3)π(3((75/π)^(1/3))²)(dr/dt)\n\nNow, we will solve for dr/dt:\n\n10 = (4π)((75/π)^(2/3))(dr/dt)\n\nTo isolate dr/dt, divide both sides by (4π)((75/π)^(2/3)):\n\ndr/dt = 10 / (4π((75/π)^(2/3)))\n\ndr/dt ≈ 0.057 cm/s\n\nSo, the rate at which the radius is increasing when the volume of the balloon is 100 cm³ is approximately 0.057 cm/s."
