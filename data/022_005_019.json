    "message_2": "First, we need to find the poles of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 2) / (z^3 + 3z). To do this, we set the denominator equal to zero:\n\nz^3 + 3z = 0\nz(z^2 + 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us two poles: z = 0 and z = ±√3i. However, only the poles inside the unit circle |z| = 1 will contribute to the integral. In this case, the only pole inside the unit circle is z = 0.\n\nNext, we find the residue of f(z) at z = 0. Since z = 0 is a simple pole, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = lim (z -> 0) [(z - 0) * f(z)]\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = lim (z -> 0) [z * (z^2 + 2) / (z^3 + 3z)]\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = lim (z -> 0) [(z^2 + 2) / (z^2(z + 3))]\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = (0^2 + 2) / (0^2(0 + 3)) = 2/0 = ∞\n\nSince the residue is infinite, we cannot use the Residue theorem directly. Instead, we rewrite the function f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 2) / (z^3 + 3z) = (z^2 + 2) / z(z^2 + 3) = 1/z + g(z)\n\nwhere g(z) = (2 - z) / (z^2 + 3) is a function that is analytic inside the unit circle. Now, we can use the Residue theorem to evaluate the integral:\n\n∮γ f(z) dz = ∮γ (1/z + g(z)) dz = ∮γ (1/z) dz + ∮γ g(z) dz\n\nSince g(z) is analytic inside the unit circle, its integral over the contour is zero:\n\n∮γ g(z) dz = 0\n\nNow, we only need to evaluate the integral of 1/z over the contour:\n\n∮γ (1/z) dz = 2πi\n\nSo, the integral of f(z) over the positively oriented closed contour γ defined by the unit circle |z| = 1 is:\n\n∮γ f(z) dz = 2πi"
