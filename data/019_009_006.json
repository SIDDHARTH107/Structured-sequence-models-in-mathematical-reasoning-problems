    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, the negation symbol (¬) represents the denial of a statement being true. However, intuitionistic logic does not accept the law of excluded middle, which means that a statement is not necessarily either true or false.\n\nIn this case, the statement (2+2=4) is true. So, the negation of this statement, ¬(2+2=4), would represent the denial of its truth. However, since intuitionistic logic does not accept the law of excluded middle, we cannot simply say that ¬(2+2=4) is false.\n\nInstead, we can only say that ¬(2+2=4) is not provable in intuitionistic logic, as there is no evidence or proof to support the denial of the truth of (2+2=4)."
