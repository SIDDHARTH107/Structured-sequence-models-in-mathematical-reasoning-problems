    "message_1": "In a game, Player 1 has a card with a number between 1 and 10 written on it, but Player 2 does not know the number on the card. However, Player 2 knows that the number on the card is an even number. Player 1 tells Player 2, \"I will reveal the number on the card if it is greater than 4.\" After hearing this, Player 2 confidently claims, \"The number on the card is 8.\" Is Player 2's claim justified?",
    "message_2": "Player 2's claim is not justified. Since Player 2 knows that the number on the card is an even number, the possible numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Player 1's statement that they will reveal the number if it is greater than 4 only tells Player 2 that if the number is revealed, it must be 6, 8, or 10. However, Player 1 has not yet revealed the number, so Player 2 cannot confidently claim that the number is 8. There is still a 1/3 chance that the number is 6 or 10 if the number is revealed, and a 2/5 chance that the number is 2 or 4 if the number is not revealed."
