    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between nodes A and E using Dijkstra's algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (A) to 0 and the distances of all other nodes to infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (A) and mark it as visited.\n\n3. Update the distances of its neighbors (B, C, and D) by adding the weight of the edge connecting the current node (A) to the neighbor. If the new distance is smaller than the previous distance, update the distance.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (E) is visited.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E}\n   Distances: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞, E=∞\n\n2. Visit A (smallest distance)\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E}\n   Distances: A=0, B=4, C=2, D=5, E=∞\n\n3. Visit C (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, D, E}\n   Update neighbors (B and D):\n   Distances: A=0, B=3 (updated), C=2, D=4 (updated), E=∞\n\n4. Visit B (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n   Unvisited nodes: {D, E}\n   Update neighbors (D and E):\n   Distances: A=0, B=3, C=2, D=4, E=9 (updated)\n\n5. Visit D (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n   Unvisited nodes: {E}\n   Update neighbor (E):\n   Distances: A=0, B=3, C=2, D=4, E=5 (updated)\n\n6. Visit E (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n   Target node E is visited, so we stop the algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path between nodes A and E is A → C → D → E with a total weight of 5."
