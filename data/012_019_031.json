    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFor a complete graph K_n with n vertices, the chromatic index can be determined using the following formula:\n\nchromatic index = n if n is odd,\nchromatic index = n - 1 if n is even.\n\nSince K5 is a complete graph with 5 vertices (which is an odd number), its chromatic index is equal to the number of vertices:\n\nchromatic index = 5"
