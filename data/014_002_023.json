    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key K using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret key, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret key.\n3. Alice computes K = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes K = A^b mod p.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key K:\n\n1. Alice computes A = 3^4 mod 7 = 81 mod 7 = 4.\n2. Bob computes B = 3^2 mod 7 = 9 mod 7 = 2.\n3. Alice computes K = 2^4 mod 7 = 16 mod 7 = 2.\n4. Bob computes K = 4^2 mod 7 = 16 mod 7 = 2.\n\nThe shared secret key K is 2."
