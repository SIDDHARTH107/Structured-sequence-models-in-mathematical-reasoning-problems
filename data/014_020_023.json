You also know that the message contains the word \"mathematics\" at some point. Using frequency analysis, determine the key phrase used to encrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "To determine the key phrase used to encrypt the message, we will need the encrypted message itself. Please provide the encrypted message so that we can proceed with the frequency analysis and find the key phrase."
