    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using the trigonometry method, we need to find the magnitude of each vector, the angle between them, and the unit normal vector.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) = √(4 + 9 + 16) = √29\n|B| = √((-1)^2 + 5^2 + 7^2) = √(1 + 25 + 49) = √75\n\nNext, we need to find the angle between the two vectors. To do this, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nThe dot product of A and B is:\n\nA · B = (2 * -1) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = -2 + 15 + 28 = 41\n\nNow we can find the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| * |B|) = 41 / (√29 * √75)\n\nNow, we need to find the unit normal vector (n̂) perpendicular to both A and B. We can use the cross product formula:\n\nA x B = |A| * |B| * sin(θ) * n̂\n\nSince we have cos(θ), we can find sin(θ) using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1\nsin(θ) = √(1 - cos^2(θ))\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = |A| * |B| * sin(θ) * n̂ = √29 * √75 * √(1 - (41 / (√29 * √75))^2) * n̂\n\nTo find the components of the cross product, we can use the following formula:\n\nA x B = (Ay * Bz - Az * By, Az * Bx - Ax * Bz, Ax * By - Ay * Bx)\n\nA x B = (3 * 7 - 4 * 5, 4 * -1 - 2 * 7, 2 * 5 - 3 * -1) = (-1, 6, 13)\n\nSo, the cross product of vector A and vector B is:\n\nA x B = [-1, 6, 13]"
