    "message_2": "We will use the Sylow Theorems to solve this problem.\n\nLet G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, must divide 25 and satisfy n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. \n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, say P. By the Sylow Theorems, P is normal in G. Since the order of P is 5, P is a cyclic group of order 5. Since |G| = 25 = 5^2 and |P| = 5, we have |G/P| = 5. Thus, G/P is a cyclic group of order 5. By the Correspondence Theorem, there exists a normal subgroup Q of G such that Q/P is a Sylow 5-subgroup of G/P. Since Q/P is a cyclic group of order 5, Q is a cyclic group of order 25. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 25.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 25\nIn this case, there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups of G. Let P and Q be two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups of G. Since P and Q are both cyclic groups of order 5, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1. Thus, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Now, consider the set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Since |P| = |Q| = 5 and P ∩ Q = {e}, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 25. Thus, PQ = G.\n\nNow, let's show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. Define a map φ: P × Q → G by φ(p, q) = pq for all p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is a homomorphism: Let (p1, q1), (p2, q2) ∈ P × Q. Then,\nφ((p1, q1)(p2, q2)) = φ(p1p2, q1q2) = p1p2q1q2.\nSince P and Q are normal subgroups, we have p1q1 = q1p1 and p2q2 = q2p2. Thus,\nφ((p1, q1)(p2, q2)) = p1q1p2q2 = p1p2q1q2 = φ(p1, q1)φ(p2, q2).\n\n2. φ is injective: Suppose φ(p, q) = e for some (p, q) ∈ P × Q. Then, pq = e, which implies p = q^(-1). Since p ∈ P and q^(-1) ∈ Q, we have p = q^(-1) ∈ P ∩ Q. But P ∩ Q = {e}, so p = q^(-1) = e. Thus, (p, q) = (e, e), and the kernel of φ is trivial.\n\n3. φ is surjective: Since |PQ| = |G|, for any g ∈ G, there exist p ∈ P and q ∈ Q such that g = pq. Thus, φ(p, q) = g, and φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
