    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 divides 3^0 = 1, and\n2. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\nThe only possibility is n_3 = 1. Let P be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, by the Sylow Theorems, P is normal in G. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/P. Since |G| = 27 and |P| = 9, we have |G/P| = 27/9 = 3. Since there is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism, namely the cyclic group Z_3, we have G/P ≅ Z_3.\n\nBy the Correspondence Theorem, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of G containing P and the subgroups of G/P. In particular, there is a subgroup H of G such that H/P is the unique subgroup of order 3 in G/P. Since H/P ≅ Z_3, we have |H| = |P| * |H/P| = 9 * 3 = 27, so H = G.\n\nNow, we have G/P ≅ Z_3, and P is a normal subgroup of G. By the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem, there is a homomorphism φ: G → G/P with kernel P. Since G/P is cyclic, there exists an element g ∈ G such that φ(g) generates G/P. Then, the order of g in G is 27, so G is cyclic, generated by g.\n\nIn conclusion, G is a cyclic group of order 27, and it is not isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
