    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod p). In other words, the factorial of (p-1) leaves a remainder of -1 when divided by p.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem, we can start by testing prime numbers in ascending order. \n\nFor p = 2, (2-1)! = 1! = 1, which does not satisfy the theorem since 1 is not congruent to -1 modulo 2.\n\nFor p = 3, (3-1)! = 2! = 2, which satisfies the theorem since 2 is congruent to -1 modulo 3.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem is 3."
