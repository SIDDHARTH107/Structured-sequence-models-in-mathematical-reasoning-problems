    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 5x - 3, we can use the vertex formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2, b = 5, and c = -3.\n\nx = -5 / (2 * 2) = -5 / 4\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(-5/4)^2 + 5(-5/4) - 3\n\ny = 2(25/16) - (25/4) - 3\ny = 50/16 - 100/16 - 48/16\ny = (-98/16)\n\nSo, the vertex is (-5/4, -98/16).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = -5/4\n\nSince the coefficient of the x^2 term (a) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum value. The minimum value of the equation is the y-coordinate of the vertex:\n\nMinimum value = -98/16"
