    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest possible vertex cover for the given graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges.\n\nWe can use the fact that the size of the minimum vertex cover is always greater than or equal to the size of the maximum matching. A matching is a set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex. The maximum matching is the largest possible matching in a graph.\n\nIn the worst case, we can have a complete bipartite graph K_(5,5) with 10 vertices and 15 edges. In this case, the maximum matching would be 5, as each vertex in one partition can be matched to a vertex in the other partition. Therefore, the minimum vertex cover must be at least 5.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a vertex cover of size 5. In the complete bipartite graph K_(5,5), we can choose all the vertices from one partition as the vertex cover. This would cover all the 15 edges, as each edge connects a vertex from one partition to a vertex in the other partition.\n\nThus, the smallest possible vertex cover for this graph is 5."
