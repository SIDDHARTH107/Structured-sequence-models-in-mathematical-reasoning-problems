    "message_2": "The equation given is known as the Fermat cubic surface. To find the number of rational points on this surface, we can use the following approach:\n\nFirst, note that if $(x, y, z)$ is a rational point on the surface, then so is $(-x, -y, -z)$. This is because if we substitute $(-x, -y, -z)$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$(-x)^3 + (-y)^3 + (-z)^3 - 3(-x)(-y)(-z) = -x^3 - y^3 - z^3 + 3xyz = 0$\n\nSince $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3xyz$, the equation holds true. Therefore, we can focus on finding rational points in the octant where $x, y, z \\geq 0$ and then count their negatives as well.\n\nNow, consider the projective version of the Fermat cubic surface, given by the homogeneous equation:\n\n$X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 - 3XYZ = 0$\n\nWe can use the technique of descent to find rational points on this surface. First, note that the point $(1:1:1)$ is a trivial rational point on the surface. We can use this point to find other rational points by drawing lines through $(1:1:1)$ and intersecting them with the surface.\n\nLet the line through $(1:1:1)$ and a general point $(x:y:z)$ be given by:\n\n$(X:Y:Z) = (1-tx:1-ty:1-tz)$\n\nSubstituting this into the projective equation, we get:\n\n$(1-tx)^3 + (1-ty)^3 + (1-tz)^3 - 3(1-tx)(1-ty)(1-tz) = 0$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain a cubic equation in $t$:\n\n$t^3(xyz - x - y - z) + t^2(3x^2y + 3xy^2 + 3x^2z + 3xz^2 + 3y^2z + 3yz^2 - 6xyz) + t(3x^3 + 3y^3 + 3z^3 - 6x^2y - 6xy^2 - 6x^2z - 6xz^2 - 6y^2z - 6yz^2) + x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0$\n\nSince we know that $t = 1$ is a solution (corresponding to the point $(1:1:1)$), we can factor out $(t-1)$:\n\n$(t-1)(t^2(xyz - x - y - z) + t(3x^2y + 3xy^2 + 3x^2z + 3xz^2 + 3y^2z + 3yz^2 - 6xyz) + (3x^3 + 3y^3 + 3z^3 - 6x^2y - 6xy^2 - 6x^2z - 6xz^2 - 6y^2z - 6yz^2)) = 0$\n\nNow, we can find rational points on the surface by finding rational solutions to the quadratic equation in $t$:\n\n$t^2(xyz - x - y - z) + t(3x^2y + 3xy^2 + 3x^2z + 3xz^2 + 3y^2z + 3yz^2 - 6xyz) + (3x^3 + 3y^3 + 3z^3 - 6x^2y - 6xy^2 - 6x^2z - 6xz^2 - 6y^2z - 6yz^2) = 0$\n\nHowever, finding all rational solutions to this equation is a difficult task, and there is no known general method to find all of them. In fact, it is known that there are infinitely many rational points on the Fermat cubic surface, but finding them all is still an open problem.\n\nIn conclusion, there are infinitely many rational points on the Calabi-Yau surface defined by the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3-3xyz=0$, but finding all of them is a challenging and unsolved problem."
