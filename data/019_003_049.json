    "message_1": "Sorry, it is not possible to frame a precise numerical problem based on Modal logic as this subtopic deals with the study of modalities such as possibility, necessity, contingency, etc. which are not directly linked to numerical values. However, I can give you a sample question based on Modal logic, which can help you understand the concept:\n\nConsider the following statement - \"It is necessary that if P is true, then Q is true. It is also possible that if P is false, then Q is true.\" Identify the truth value of the statement if P is true and Q is false.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given statement step by step.\n\n1. \"It is necessary that if P is true, then Q is true.\"\nSince P is true and Q is false, this part of the statement is false.\n\n2. \"It is also possible that if P is false, then Q is true.\"\nSince P is true, this part of the statement is irrelevant to the current situation.\n\nAs the first part of the statement is false, the overall statement is false."
