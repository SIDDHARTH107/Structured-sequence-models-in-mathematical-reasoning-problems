    "message_2": "To find the size of the minimum vertex cover of G, we can use the fact that the size of a maximum matching M in a graph is related to the size of a minimum vertex cover C by the inequality:\n\n|M| ≤ |C|\n\nThis is known as König's theorem. In other words, the size of the minimum vertex cover is at least as large as the size of the maximum matching.\n\nSince G has 7 vertices and 10 edges, by the Pigeonhole principle, at least one vertex must have a degree of at least 3. Let's denote this vertex as v.\n\nNow, consider the subgraph G' obtained by removing vertex v and its incident edges. G' has 6 vertices and at most 7 edges (since we removed at least 3 edges connected to v). In the worst case, G' is a complete bipartite graph K_{3,3} with 3 vertices on each side, which has a maximum matching of size 3.\n\nAdding vertex v back to the graph, we can form a matching of size 4 by including v and one of its neighbors. Therefore, the size of the maximum matching M in G is at least 4.\n\nBy König's theorem, the size of the minimum vertex cover C is at least as large as the size of the maximum matching M, so |C| ≥ 4.\n\nThus, the size of the minimum vertex cover of G is at least 4."
