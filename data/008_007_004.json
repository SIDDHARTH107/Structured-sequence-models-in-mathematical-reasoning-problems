    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A. \n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is given by det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[3 - λ, -1, 2], [2, 4 - λ, -2], [1, 1, 5 - λ]]\n\nNow, we need to compute the determinant of this matrix:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)[(4 - λ)(5 - λ) - (-2)(1)] - (-1)[2(5 - λ) - (-2)(1)] + 2[2(1) - (4 - λ)(1)]\n\n= (3 - λ)[(4 - λ)(5 - λ) + 2] - (-1)[10 - 2λ + 2] + 2[2 - 4 + λ]\n\n= (3 - λ)[(20 - 9λ + λ^2) + 2] + (12 - 2λ) + 2(λ - 2)\n\n= (3 - λ)(λ^2 - 9λ + 22) + 10 + 2λ\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this polynomial:\n\n(3 - λ)(λ^2 - 9λ + 22) + 10 + 2λ = 0\n\nBy solving this equation, we get the eigenvalues λ1 = 1, λ2 = 3, and λ3 = 8.\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues:\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([[2, -1, 2], [2, 3, -2], [1, 1, 4]])(v1) = 0\n\nBy solving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v1 = [1, 2, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 3:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([[0, -1, 2], [2, 1, -2], [1, 1, 2]])(v2) = 0\n\nBy solving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v2 = [1, 1, 0].\n\nFor λ3 = 8:\n\n(A - λ3I)v3 = 0\n([[-5, -1, 2], [2, -4, -2], [1, 1, -3]])(v3) = 0\n\nBy solving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v3 = [2, -1, 1].\n\nNow, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [[1, 1, 2], [2, 1, -1], [1, 0, 1]]\n\nThe diagonal matrix D will have the eigenvalues as its diagonal entries:\n\nD = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 8]]\n\nSo, the diagonal entries of D are 1, 3, and 8."
