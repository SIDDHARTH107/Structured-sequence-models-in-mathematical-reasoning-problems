    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on its order and the properties of groups.\n\nSince G is a group of order 4, it has 4 elements. Let G = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element. We will consider the possible orders of the elements a, b, and c.\n\n1. If there exists an element of order 4, say a, then G is cyclic and generated by a. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4, which has elements {e, a, a^2, a^3} and the following multiplication table:\n\n```\n   e  a  a^2  a^3\ne  e  a  a^2  a^3\na  a a^2 a^3   e\na^2 a^2 a^3  e   a\na^3 a^3  e  a  a^2\n```\n\n2. If there is no element of order 4, then all non-identity elements must have order 2. This means that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. We will now show that G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4, which has elements {e, a, b, c} and the following multiplication table:\n\n```\n   e  a  b  c\ne  e  a  b  c\na  a  e  c  b\nb  b  c  e  a\nc  c  b  a  e\n```\n\nSince a^2 = e, we have a * a = e. Similarly, b * b = e and c * c = e. Now, we need to find the product of distinct elements, say a * b. Since a * b cannot be equal to a or b (otherwise, one of them would have order 1 or 4), and a * b cannot be equal to e (otherwise, a and b would be inverses, and one of them would have order 4), we must have a * b = c. By symmetry, we also have b * a = c, b * c = a, c * b = a, c * a = b, and a * c = b. This multiplication table matches the one for V4, so G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 4 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, depending on the orders of its elements. If there exists an element of order 4, G is isomorphic to C4; otherwise, G is isomorphic to V4."
