    "message_2": "The Hopf map, denoted by $h: S^3 \\to S^2$, is a continuous map from the 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ to the 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$. It is a well-known example of a non-trivial fiber bundle, and it is used in various areas of mathematics, including algebraic topology and differential geometry.\n\nTo define the Hopf map, we first consider $S^3$ as a subset of the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}^2$. That is, we represent points in $S^3$ as pairs of complex numbers $(z_1, z_2)$ such that $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = r^2 = 4$. Now, we define the Hopf map $h: S^3 \\to S^2$ as follows:\n\n$$\nh(z_1, z_2) = \\left(2\\operatorname{Re}(z_1\\bar{z}_2), 2\\operatorname{Im}(z_1\\bar{z}_2), |z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2\\right),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{Re}(z)$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(z)$ denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number $z$, respectively, and $\\bar{z}$ denotes the complex conjugate of $z$.\n\nThe Hopf map has some interesting properties. For example, it is a smooth map, and its fibers (i.e., the inverse images of points in $S^2$) are circles, which are linked together in a non-trivial way. This linking structure is known as the Hopf fibration, and it is a key feature of the Hopf map."
