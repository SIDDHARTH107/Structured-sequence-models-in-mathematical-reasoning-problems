    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of candidates, k is the number of positions to be filled, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nIn this case, n = 15 (total candidates) and k = 5 (positions to be filled).\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15-5)!)\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!10!)\n\nC(15, 5) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(15, 5) = 3003\n\nSo, there are 3003 different ways the company can fill 5 of the job positions with the available candidates to maximize their overall skill set."
