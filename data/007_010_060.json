    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let x be the integer we are looking for. We have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 4 (mod 9)\n\nFirst, find the product of the moduli: N = 7 * 9 = 63.\n\nNext, calculate the individual modular inverses. For the first congruence, we have:\n\nN1 = N / 7 = 63 / 7 = 9\ny1 = 9^(-1) (mod 7)\n\nFor the second congruence, we have:\n\nN2 = N / 9 = 63 / 9 = 7\ny2 = 7^(-1) (mod 9)\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses y1 and y2. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for this:\n\nFor y1, we have:\n\n9 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n9 * 2 ≡ 18 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, y1 = 2.\n\nFor y2, we have:\n\n7 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n7 * 4 ≡ 28 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n\nSo, y2 = 4.\n\nNow, we can find the integer x using the formula:\n\nx = (a1 * N1 * y1) + (a2 * N2 * y2) (mod N)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nx = (3 * 9 * 2) + (4 * 7 * 4) (mod 63)\nx = (54) + (112) (mod 63)\nx = 166 (mod 63)\n\nFinally, we find the smallest positive integer:\n\nx = 166 % 63 = 40\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions is 40."
