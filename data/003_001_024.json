    "message_2": "In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. Since the hypotenuse is given as 10, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n2x = 10\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 5\n\nNow we can find the lengths of the other two sides:\n\nShorter side (opposite the 30-degree angle) = 1x = 1 * 5 = 5\nLonger side (opposite the 60-degree angle) = √3x = √3 * 5 = 5√3\n\nSo, the lengths of the other two sides are 5 and 5√3."
