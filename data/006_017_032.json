    "message_1": "A town has a total of 20 traffic accidents per year on its main road. The probability of any single accident being a hit-and-run accident is 0.15. What is the probability that out of the 20 accidents, exactly 3 of them will be hit-and-run accidents?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x hit-and-run accidents\n- n is the total number of accidents (20 in this case)\n- x is the number of hit-and-run accidents we want to find the probability for (3 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a single accident being a hit-and-run (0.15 in this case)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(3) = (20C3) * (0.15^3) * (1-0.15)^(20-3)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 20C3:\n\n20C3 = 20! / (3! * (20-3)!)\n= 20! / (3! * 17!)\n= (20 * 19 * 18) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 1140\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(3) = 1140 * (0.15^3) * (0.85^17)\n≈ 1140 * 0.003375 * 0.030978\n≈ 0.141\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 3 hit-and-run accidents out of the 20 accidents is approximately 0.141 or 14.1%."
