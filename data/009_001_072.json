    "message_2": "To model the population growth, we can use the exponential growth equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is the time in years, and k is the growth rate.\n\nIn this case, the growth rate k is 3% per year, so k = 0.03.\n\nThe differential equation for the population growth is:\n\ndP/dt = 0.03P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.03 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.03 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition that the population is 500,000 in the year 2010. Let's set t = 0 for the year 2010:\n\nln(500,000) = 0.03(0) + C\n\nC = ln(500,000)\n\nNow, we can write the equation for the population as a function of time:\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + ln(500,000)\n\nTo find the population in the year 2030, we can plug in t = 20 (since 2030 is 20 years after 2010):\n\nln(P) = 0.03(20) + ln(500,000)\n\nln(P) = 0.6 + ln(500,000)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to solve for P:\n\nP = e^(0.6 + ln(500,000))\n\nP ≈ 1,098,541\n\nSo, the city's population in the year 2030 is approximately 1,098,541."
