    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrices. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the first two equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 2, and then add the two equations together:\n\n(1)(x + 2y + z) = (1)(10)\n(2)(2x - y - 3z) = (2)(-4)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\nx + 2y + z = 10\n4x - 2y - 6z = -8\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n5x - 5z = 2\n\nNow, let's eliminate y from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 1 and the third equation by -2, and then add the two equations together:\n\n(1)(2x - y - 3z) = (1)(-4)\n(-2)(4x + y + 2z) = (-2)(3)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n2x - y - 3z = -4\n-8x - 2y - 4z = -6\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n-6x - 7z = -10\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n5x - 5z = 2\n-6x - 7z = -10\n\nTo eliminate x, we can multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 5, and then add the two equations together:\n\n(6)(5x - 5z) = (6)(2)\n(5)(-6x - 7z) = (5)(-10)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n30x - 30z = 12\n-30x - 35z = -50\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n-5z = -38\n\nNow, divide by -5:\n\nz = 38/5\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into the equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nLet's substitute z into the first equation of the two-variable system:\n\n5x - 5z = 2\n5x - 5(38/5) = 2\n\n5x - 38 = 2\n\nNow, add 38 to both sides:\n\n5x = 40\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\nx = 8\n\nNow, let's substitute x and z into one of the original equations to find y. We'll use the first equation:\n\nx + 2y + z = 10\n8 + 2y + (38/5) = 10\n\nNow, subtract 8 and 38/5 from both sides:\n\n2y = 10 - 8 - 38/5\n2y = 2 - 38/5\n2y = 10/5 - 38/5\n2y = -28/5\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\ny = (-28/5) / 2\ny = -14/5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 8, y = -14/5, and z = 38/5."
