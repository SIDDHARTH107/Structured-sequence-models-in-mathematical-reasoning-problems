    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). To find the maximum number of vertices in an independent set of G, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Find the minimum vertex cover of G.\n2. Subtract the size of the minimum vertex cover from the total number of vertices in G.\n\nA vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover.\n\nSince G has 10 vertices and 20 edges, it is a simple graph (i.e., no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices). The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with n vertices is given by the formula:\n\nmax_edges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nFor G, with 10 vertices, the maximum number of edges is:\n\nmax_edges = 10 * (10 - 1) / 2 = 45\n\nHowever, G has only 20 edges, which is less than the maximum possible number of edges. This means that G is not a complete graph, and there must be some vertices that are not connected by an edge.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum vertex cover of G. Since G is not a complete graph, its minimum vertex cover will be smaller than the total number of vertices. Unfortunately, finding the minimum vertex cover is an NP-hard problem, and there is no efficient algorithm to solve it for all graphs. However, we can use some heuristics to estimate the size of the minimum vertex cover.\n\nOne such heuristic is the greedy algorithm, which iteratively selects the vertex with the highest degree (i.e., the largest number of incident edges) and removes it along with its incident edges from the graph. This process is repeated until all edges are removed. The set of selected vertices forms an approximate vertex cover.\n\nLet's assume that we have found an approximate minimum vertex cover of size k. Then, the maximum number of vertices in an independent set of G is:\n\nmax_independent_set = total_vertices - min_vertex_cover = 10 - k\n\nSince we don't have the exact graph structure, we cannot find the exact value of k. However, we can estimate that the maximum number of vertices in an independent set of G will be in the range of 3 to 6, depending on the graph's structure."
