    "message_2": "To compute the Cartesian product of two sets, we form ordered pairs with the elements from the first set as the first element of the pair and the elements from the second set as the second element of the pair.\n\nFirst, let's compute A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compute (A × B) × C:\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nNext, let's compute B × C:\nB × C = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, let's compute A × (B × C):\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nNow, we can see that the two sets (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are not equal, as their elements are not the same. However, we can establish a bijection between the two sets, which shows that they have the same cardinality and can be considered equivalent in some sense.\n\nDefine a function f: (A × B) × C → A × (B × C) as follows:\nf(((a, b), c)) = (a, (b, c))\n\nLet's apply this function to the elements of (A × B) × C:\nf(((1, 3), 5)) = (1, (3, 5))\nf(((1, 4), 5)) = (1, (4, 5))\nf(((2, 3), 5)) = (2, (3, 5))\nf(((2, 4), 5)) = (2, (4, 5))\n\nAs we can see, the function f maps the elements of (A × B) × C to the elements of A × (B × C). The function f is a bijection, as it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).\n\nTherefore, although the two sets (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are not equal, they are equivalent in the sense that there exists a bijection between them. This shows that the Cartesian product of sets can be considered associative up to a bijection."
