    "message_2": "To model the population growth, we can use the exponential growth differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, and k is the growth rate.\n\nGiven that the population is growing at a rate of 3% per year, we have:\n\nk = 0.03\n\nSo the differential equation becomes:\n\ndP/dt = 0.03P\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.03 dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + C\n\nwhere C is the integration constant. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 5000:\n\nln(5000) = 0.03(0) + C\n\nC = ln(5000)\n\nNow we can write the general solution of the differential equation:\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + ln(5000)\n\nTo find the time it takes for the population to double, we need to find t when P = 10000:\n\nln(10000) = 0.03t + ln(5000)\n\nSubtracting ln(5000) from both sides, we get:\n\nln(2) = 0.03t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = ln(2) / 0.03 â‰ˆ 23.1 years\n\nSo it takes approximately 23.1 years for the population to double."
