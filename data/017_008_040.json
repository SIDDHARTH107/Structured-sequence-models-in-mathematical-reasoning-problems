    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 8 is isomorphic to one of the groups C8, Q8, or D4, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems and then show that G must be isomorphic to one of the three groups.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p, if p^k divides the order of G (|G|), then G has a subgroup of order p^k.\n2. All subgroups of order p^k are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of subgroups of order p^k divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G of order 8.\n\nSince 8 = 2^3, by the first Sylow theorem, G has a subgroup of order 2^3 = 8. Since G itself is of order 8, G is a p-group (a group of order p^k for some prime p). In particular, G is a 2-group.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements of order 2 in G. By the class equation, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + âˆ‘[G:C(x)]\n\nwhere Z(G) is the center of G, C(x) is the centralizer of x, and the sum is taken over one representative x from each conjugacy class of elements not in the center.\n\nSince G is a 2-group, the size of each conjugacy class must be a power of 2. If an element x is not in the center, then its conjugacy class has at least 2 elements. Therefore, |Z(G)| must be at least 2.\n\nCase 1: |Z(G)| = 8\n\nIn this case, G is abelian and isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, C4xC2, or C2xC2xC2. Since G has a subgroup of order 8 (itself), G must be isomorphic to C8.\n\nCase 2: |Z(G)| = 4\n\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 2, which implies that G is a semidirect product of Z(G) by a group of order 2. Since Z(G) is a group of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either C4 or C2xC2.\n\nIf Z(G) is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, which has 8 elements.\n\nIf Z(G) is isomorphic to C2xC2, then G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8, which also has 8 elements.\n\nIn either case, G is isomorphic to one of the groups D4 or Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 8 must be isomorphic to one of the groups C8, Q8, or D4."
