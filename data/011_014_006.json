    "message_2": "In a connected graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. Let's denote the number of edges as E.\n\nFrom the given degrees, we have:\n\n2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + x = 2E\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can use the fact that the minimum number of edges in a connected graph with n vertices is n - 1. In this case, n = 8, so the minimum number of edges is 8 - 1 = 7. However, since there are vertices with degrees greater than 2, the graph must have more than 7 edges.\n\nLet's try E = 8:\n\n2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + x = 2 * 8\n21 + x = 16\nx = -5\n\nSince the degree of a vertex cannot be negative, E cannot be 8. Let's try E = 9:\n\n2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + x = 2 * 9\n21 + x = 18\nx = -3\n\nAgain, the degree of a vertex cannot be negative, so E cannot be 9. Let's try E = 10:\n\n2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + x = 2 * 10\n21 + x = 20\nx = -1\n\nThe degree of a vertex still cannot be negative, so E cannot be 10. Let's try E = 11:\n\n2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + x = 2 * 11\n21 + x = 22\nx = 1\n\nNow we have a non-negative value for x. Therefore, the value of x is 1, and the graph has 11 edges."
