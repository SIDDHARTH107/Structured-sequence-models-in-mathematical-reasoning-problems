    "message_2": "A simplicial complex with faces having at most 3 vertices consists of triangles. To maximize the number of faces, we want to maximize the number of triangles we can form using the 10 vertices and 20 edges.\n\nIn a complete graph with 10 vertices, there are 10 choose 3, or 120, possible triangles. However, we are limited to 20 edges. To maximize the number of triangles, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. Start with a vertex, say A. Connect it to 5 other vertices (B, C, D, E, F). This uses 5 edges and forms 5 choose 2, or 10, triangles (ABD, ABE, ABF, ACE, ACF, ADE, ADF, AEF).\n\n2. Now, connect vertex B to vertices C, D, E, and F. This uses 4 more edges, bringing the total to 9 edges. This forms 4 more triangles (BCE, BCF, BDE, BDF).\n\n3. Connect vertex C to vertices D, E, and F. This uses 3 more edges, bringing the total to 12 edges. This forms 3 more triangles (CDE, CDF, CEF).\n\n4. Connect vertex D to vertices E and F. This uses 2 more edges, bringing the total to 14 edges. This forms 2 more triangles (DEF, DFE).\n\n5. Finally, connect vertex E to vertex F. This uses 1 more edge, bringing the total to 15 edges. This forms 1 more triangle (EFA).\n\nIn total, we have used 15 edges and formed 20 triangles. Since we are limited to 20 edges, we can't form any more triangles without violating the edge constraint. Therefore, the maximum number of faces (triangles) this simplicial complex can have is 20."
