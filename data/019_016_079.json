    "message_2": "A set with 5 distinct elements has 2^5 = 32 possible subsets (including the empty set and the set itself). Since we are looking for non-zero subsets, we need to exclude the empty set. So, there are 32 - 1 = 31 non-zero subsets that can be formed from a set of 5 distinct elements."
