    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos^2(x) - 3cos(x) + 1 = 0, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in terms of cos(x). Let u = cos(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2u^2 - 3u + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for u using the quadratic formula:\n\nu = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -3, and c = 1:\n\nu = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(2)(1))) / (2(2))\nu = (3 ± √(9 - 8)) / 4\nu = (3 ± √1) / 4\n\nThis gives us two possible values for u:\n\nu1 = (3 + 1) / 4 = 1\nu2 = (3 - 1) / 4 = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which cos(x) = u1 and cos(x) = u2 in the range [0, 2π).\n\nFor u1 = 1:\ncos(x) = 1\nx = 2πn, where n is an integer\n\nSince we are looking for solutions in the range [0, 2π), the only solution for u1 is x = 0.\n\nFor u2 = 1/2:\ncos(x) = 1/2\nx = π/3 + 2πn or x = 5π/3 + 2πn, where n is an integer\n\nIn the range [0, 2π), the solutions for u2 are x = π/3 and x = 5π/3.\n\nSo, the solutions for the original equation 2cos^2(x) - 3cos(x) + 1 = 0 in the range [0, 2π) are x = 0, x = π/3, and x = 5π/3."
