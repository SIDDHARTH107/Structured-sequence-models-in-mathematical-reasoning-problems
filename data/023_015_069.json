If the Fourier Transform of this wave is given by:\nF(jω) = 10[δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)]\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function and ω is the angular frequency. Determine the amplitude of the wave at t = 0.5 seconds at a point x = 1 meter away from the source.",
    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude of the wave at t = 0.5 seconds and x = 1 meter, we need to first find the inverse Fourier Transform of F(jω) to obtain the time-domain function f(t). The inverse Fourier Transform of F(jω) is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫ F(jω) * e^(jωt) dω\n\nSince F(jω) contains Dirac delta functions, the integral simplifies to:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * [10 * e^(j(2π)t) - 10 * e^(-j(2π)t)]\n\nf(t) = (5 / π) * [e^(j(2π)t) - e^(-j(2π)t)]\n\nNow, we can use Euler's formula to convert the complex exponentials to sines and cosines:\n\nf(t) = (5 / π) * [cos(2πt) + jsin(2πt) - cos(2πt) + jsin(2πt)]\n\nf(t) = (10 / π) * sin(2πt)\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude of the wave at t = 0.5 seconds:\n\nf(0.5) = (10 / π) * sin(2π * 0.5)\n\nf(0.5) = (10 / π) * sin(π)\n\nSince sin(π) = 0, the amplitude of the wave at t = 0.5 seconds and x = 1 meter is:\n\nf(0.5) = 0"
