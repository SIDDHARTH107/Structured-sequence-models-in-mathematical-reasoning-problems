B4 is connected to B5, B2, and B3. The connections are preserved.\n- A2 is connected to A1, A3, and A4. B5 is connected to B4, B2, and B3. The connections are preserved.\n- A3 is connected to A1, A2, and A4. B2 is connected to B4, B5, and B3. The connections are preserved.\n- A4 is connected to A1, A2, and A3. B3 is connected to B4, B5, and B2.
