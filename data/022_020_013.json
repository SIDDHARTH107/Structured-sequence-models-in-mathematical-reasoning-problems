    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem, we first find the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation:\n\n$$y''(x) + 3y'(x) + 2y(x) = 0$$\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. We can solve it by assuming a solution of the form $y(x) = e^{rx}$, where $r$ is a constant. Substituting this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$$(r^2 + 3r + 2)e^{rx} = 0$$\n\nSince $e^{rx}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by it, which gives us the characteristic equation:\n\n$$r^2 + 3r + 2 = 0$$\n\nFactoring the characteristic equation, we get:\n\n$$(r + 1)(r + 2) = 0$$\n\nThis gives us two distinct real roots, $r_1 = -1$ and $r_2 = -2$. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\n$$y(x) = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 e^{-2x}$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. First, we use the boundary condition $y(0) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = C_1 e^{0} + C_2 e^{0} \\Rightarrow 0 = C_1 + C_2$$\n\nNext, we use the boundary condition $y(\\pi/2) = 1$:\n\n$$1 = C_1 e^{-\\pi/2} + C_2 e^{-\\pi}$$\n\nNow, we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $C_1$ and $C_2$. We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. We can express $C_2$ in terms of $C_1$ from the first equation:\n\n$$C_2 = -C_1$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$1 = C_1 e^{-\\pi/2} - C_1 e^{-\\pi}$$\n\nFactor out $C_1$:\n\n$$1 = C_1 (e^{-\\pi/2} - e^{-\\pi})$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $C_1$:\n\n$$C_1 = \\frac{1}{e^{-\\pi/2} - e^{-\\pi}}$$\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $C_2$:\n\n$$C_2 = -\\frac{1}{e^{-\\pi/2} - e^{-\\pi}}$$\n\nNow, we have found the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, and we can write the solution of the boundary value problem:\n\n$$y(x) = \\frac{1}{e^{-\\pi/2} - e^{-\\pi}} e^{-x} - \\frac{1}{e^{-\\pi/2} - e^{-\\pi}} e^{-2x}$$"
