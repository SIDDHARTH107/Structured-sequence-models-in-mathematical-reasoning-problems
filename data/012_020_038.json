    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (i.e., isomorphisms from the graph to itself). In other words, it is the set of all permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relations between the vertices.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the following automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity (no change): (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)\n2. Swap vertices 1 and 4: (1 4)(2)(3)(5)\n3. Swap vertices 3 and 5: (1)(2)(3 5)(4)\n4. Swap vertices 1 and 4, and 3 and 5: (1 4)(2)(3 5)\n\nThese are the only automorphisms that preserve the adjacency relations between the vertices. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph is:\n\n{ (1)(2)(3)(4)(5), (1 4)(2)(3)(5), (1)(2)(3 5)(4), (1 4)(2)(3 5) }"
