    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent of a dynamical system is a measure of the average rate of divergence or convergence of nearby trajectories in the phase space. To compute the Lyapunov exponent of the Lorenz system, we need to linearize the system around its fixed points and then compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix.\n\nFirst, let's find the fixed points of the Lorenz system by setting the derivatives equal to zero:\n\nσ(y - x) = 0\nx(ρ - z) - y = 0\nxy - βz = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we find three fixed points:\n\n1. (0, 0, 0)\n2. (√(β(ρ-1)), √(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1)\n3. (-√(β(ρ-1)), -√(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1)\n\nNow, let's compute the Jacobian matrix of the Lorenz system:\n\nJ(x, y, z) = | -σ    σ    0  |\n             | ρ-z  -1   -x  |\n             |  y    x   -β  |\n\nNext, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix at each fixed point and compute the eigenvalues.\n\nFor the fixed point (0, 0, 0), the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(0, 0, 0) = | -10  10   0  |\n             |  28  -1   0  |\n             |  0    0  -8/3|\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are λ1 ≈ -13.86, λ2 ≈ 0.93, and λ3 ≈ -2.67. Since there is at least one positive eigenvalue, this fixed point is unstable.\n\nFor the other two fixed points, the Jacobian matrices are the same:\n\nJ(±√(β(ρ-1)), ±√(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1) = | -10  10   0   |\n                                   |  0   -1  ±√(β(ρ-1)) |\n                                   |  ±√(β(ρ-1))  ±√(β(ρ-1))  -8/3 |\n\nThe eigenvalues of these matrices are complex and depend on the parameters σ, β, and ρ. In this case, with σ = 10, β = 8/3, and ρ = 28, the real parts of the eigenvalues are negative, indicating that these fixed points are stable.\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is related to the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices. In this case, the largest Lyapunov exponent is given by the positive eigenvalue λ2 ≈ 0.93, which corresponds to the unstable fixed point (0, 0, 0). This positive Lyapunov exponent indicates that the Lorenz system exhibits chaotic behavior."
