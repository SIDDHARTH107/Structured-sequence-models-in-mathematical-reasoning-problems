    "message_2": "To determine whether the intersection of A and B is a subset of A and B, we first need to find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B: {4, 8}\n\nNow, we need to check if this intersection is a subset of both A and B. A subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set.\n\n{4, 8} is a subset of A because all its elements (4 and 8) are members of A.\n{4, 8} is also a subset of B because all its elements (4 and 8) are members of B.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of A and B, which is {4, 8}, is a subset of both A and B."
