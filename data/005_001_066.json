    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims the average diameter of a ball bearing is 5mm with a standard deviation of 0.3mm. A sample of 100 bearings showed an average diameter of 4.8mm. Can we reject the manufacturer's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether we can reject the manufacturer's claim at a 5% level of significance, we will perform a hypothesis test using the z-test statistic. \n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 5mm (The average diameter is 5mm)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 5mm (The average diameter is not 5mm)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic.\nz = (sample mean - population mean) / (population standard deviation / √sample size)\nz = (4.8 - 5) / (0.3 / √100)\nz = (-0.2) / (0.3 / 10)\nz = -0.2 / 0.03\nz = -6.67\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value for a 5% level of significance.\nSince this is a two-tailed test, we will divide the 5% level of significance by 2, which gives us 2.5% in each tail. Using a z-table, we find the critical values to be -1.96 and 1.96.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical values.\nThe test statistic, -6.67, is less than the lower critical value of -1.96.\n\nStep 5: Make a decision.\nSince the test statistic is in the critical region, we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that there is enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim that the average diameter of a ball bearing is 5mm at a 5% level of significance."
