    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for the given metric is:\n\n$$\nG = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n$$\n\\det(G) = 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 = 36\n$$\n\nNow, the volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume form in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, which is $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. Therefore, the volume form for the given metric is:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\det(G)} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = \\sqrt{36} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = 6 \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$"
