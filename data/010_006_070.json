    "message_2": "To find the homotopy class of each path, we need to determine the winding number of each path around the origin. The winding number is an integer that represents the number of times the path winds around the origin in the counterclockwise direction.\n\nFor $\\gamma_1(t)$, we have:\n$$\\gamma_1(t) = e^{2\\pi i t},\\ \\ t \\in [0, 1]$$\nAs $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$, the argument of the complex number goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$. This means that $\\gamma_1(t)$ winds around the origin once counterclockwise. Therefore, the winding number of $\\gamma_1(t)$ is $1$, and its homotopy class is $[\\gamma_1] = 1$.\n\nFor $\\gamma_2(t)$, we have:\n$$\\gamma_2(t) = e^{4\\pi i t},\\ \\ t \\in [0, 1]$$\nAs $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$, the argument of the complex number goes from $0$ to $4\\pi$. This means that $\\gamma_2(t)$ winds around the origin twice counterclockwise. Therefore, the winding number of $\\gamma_2(t)$ is $2$, and its homotopy class is $[\\gamma_2] = 2$.\n\nNow, to determine whether the two paths are homotopic, we need to check if their homotopy classes are the same. Since $[\\gamma_1] = 1$ and $[\\gamma_2] = 2$, the two paths are not homotopic."
