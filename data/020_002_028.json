Each product requires a certain amount of time on each machine, as shown in the table below:\n \n |            |Machine 1 |Machine 2 |\n |------------|----------|-----------|\n |Product A | 5         | 10           |\n |Product B| 10       | 15           |\n\nMachine 1 is available for a maximum of 250 hours and Machine 2 is available for a maximum of 400 hours. Product A sells for $50 per unit, while Product B sells for $80 per unit.\n\nAssuming the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should be produced using the available machines?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function, which is given by:\n\nProfit = 50x + 80y\n\nThe constraints are given by the available hours on each machine:\n\n5x + 10y ≤ 250 (Machine 1)\n10x + 15y ≤ 400 (Machine 2)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the boundary points of each inequality:\n\n5x + 10y = 250\ny = (250 - 5x) / 10\ny = 25 - 0.5x\n\n10x + 15y = 400\ny = (400 - 10x) / 15\ny = 80/3 - 2x/3\n\nNow, we'll find the intersection points of these lines:\n\n1) Intersection of 5x + 10y = 250 and 10x + 15y = 400:\n\n5x + 10(25 - 0.5x) = 250\n5x + 250 - 5x = 250\nx = 0\n\ny = 25 - 0.5(0) = 25\n\nIntersection point: (0, 25)\n\n2) Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0:\n\nIntersection point: (0, 0)\n\n3) Intersection of 5x + 10y = 250 and x = 0:\n\ny = (250 - 5(0)) / 10\ny = 25\n\nIntersection point: (0, 25)\n\n4) Intersection of 10x + 15y = 400 and x = 0:\n\ny = (400 - 10(0)) / 15\ny = 80/3\n\nIntersection point: (0, 80/3)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these intersection points:\n\nP(0, 25) = 50(0) + 80(25) = 2000\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 80(0) = 0\nP(0, 25) = 50(0) + 80(25) = 2000\nP(0, 80/3) = 50(0) + 80(80/3) = 2133.33\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 80/3), which means the company should produce 0 units of Product A and 80/3 ≈ 26.67 units of Product B. Since the company can only produce whole units, they should produce 27 units of Product B to maximize their profit."
