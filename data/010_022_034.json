    "message_2": "The maximum possible distance of the marble from the glass would be when the marble is at the center of the cylindrical glass. In this case, the distance would be from the center of the marble to the inner surface of the glass.\n\nWe can find this distance by considering the radius of the cylindrical glass and the radius of the marble. The distance from the center of the marble to the inner surface of the glass would be the difference between the radius of the cylindrical glass and the radius of the marble.\n\nMaximum distance = Radius of cylindrical glass - Radius of marble\nMaximum distance = 5 cm - 2 cm\nMaximum distance = 3 cm\n\nSo, the maximum possible distance of the marble from the glass is 3 cm."
