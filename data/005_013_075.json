The table below shows the means and standard deviations for each subject:\n\n| Subject | Mean | Standard Deviation |\n|---------|------|--------------------|\n| A       | 70   | 10                 |\n| B       | 80   | 15                 |\n| C       | 90   | 20                 |\n\nPerform a multiple linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between these three subjects and the overall test score. If a student scores 75 in subject A, 85 in subject B, and 95 in subject C, what is their predicted overall test score?",
    "message_2": "To perform a multiple linear regression analysis, we need the data of the 100 students' test scores in each subject and their overall test scores. However, the provided information only includes the means and standard deviations for each subject. Without the actual data, we cannot perform a multiple linear regression analysis.\n\nIf you can provide the data for the 100 students' test scores in each subject and their overall test scores, I can perform the multiple linear regression analysis and predict the overall test score for a student with scores of 75 in subject A, 85 in subject B, and 95 in subject C."
