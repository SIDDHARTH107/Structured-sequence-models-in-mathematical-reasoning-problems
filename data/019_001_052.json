    "message_2": "In this case, p = 0 (false) and q = 1 (true). The proposition states \"If p and q are both true, then p or q is true.\" Since p is false and q is true, the condition \"p and q are both true\" is not satisfied. Therefore, the proposition is considered vacuously true, as the condition for the implication is not met. The truth value of the proposition is true."
