    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a long, straight wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. Therefore, we can choose a circular loop with a radius of 2 cm (0.02 m) as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field (B) is constant along this circular path, and the angle between B and the differential length element (dl) is 0 degrees. So, the dot product B • dl = B * dl * cos(0) = B * dl.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's Law for our chosen path:\n\n∮ B * dl = B * ∮ dl = B * (2 * π * r) = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nHere, r is the radius of the circular path, which is 0.02 m. The permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nSince the wire carries a current of 5 A, the total current enclosed by the loop is 5 A.\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field strength (B):\n\nB * (2 * π * 0.02) = (4π × 10^(-7)) * 5\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 5) / (2 * π * 0.02)\n\nB ≈ (10^(-6)) * 5 / 0.04\n\nB ≈ 1.25 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire is approximately 1.25 × 10^(-4) Tesla."
