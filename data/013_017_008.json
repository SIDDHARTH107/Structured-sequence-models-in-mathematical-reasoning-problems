    "message_1": "In a market for used cars, there are two types of cars: \"good\" cars worth $8,000 and \"bad\" cars worth $4,000. The problem is that a buyer cannot determine the exact type of car for sale - only the seller knows the true value of the car. The probability of a car being \"good\" is 0.6, while the probability of a car being \"bad\" is 0.4. The seller knows the true type of car and sets a fixed price, either $6,500 or $2,500, respectively, for each type of car. What is the expected value of buying a car in this market?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of buying a car in this market, we need to consider the probabilities of each type of car and their respective prices. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected value of buying a car at $6,500:\n- If the car is \"good\" (worth $8,000) with a probability of 0.6, the buyer gains $1,500 ($8,000 - $6,500).\n- If the car is \"bad\" (worth $4,000) with a probability of 0.4, the buyer loses $2,500 ($4,000 - $6,500).\n\nExpected value for a $6,500 car = (0.6 * $1,500) + (0.4 * -$2,500) = $900 - $1,000 = -$100\n\nNext, let's calculate the expected value of buying a car at $2,500:\n- Since the seller sets a fixed price of $2,500 for \"bad\" cars, there is no uncertainty in this case. The buyer will always get a \"bad\" car (worth $4,000) and gain $1,500 ($4,000 - $2,500).\n\nExpected value for a $2,500 car = $1,500\n\nNow, we need to find the overall expected value of buying a car in this market. Since there are only two types of cars and their respective prices, we can simply average the expected values:\n\nOverall expected value = (Expected value for a $6,500 car + Expected value for a $2,500 car) / 2\n\nOverall expected value = (-$100 + $1,500) / 2 = $1,400 / 2 = $700\n\nSo, the expected value of buying a car in this market is $700."
