    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of the signal X(ω) = 2ω^2 - 3ω + 4, we need to compute the inverse Fourier transform integral:\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[X(ω) * e^(jωt) dω]\n\nwhere x(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of X(ω), and the integral is taken over the entire range of ω.\n\nFirst, let's break the integral into three parts:\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * [∫(2ω^2 * e^(jωt) dω) - ∫(3ω * e^(jωt) dω) + ∫(4 * e^(jωt) dω)]\n\nNow, we need to solve each of these integrals separately. \n\n1. ∫(2ω^2 * e^(jωt) dω):\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let u = ω^2 and dv = 2 * e^(jωt) dω. Then, du = 2ω dω and v = (1/jt) * e^(jωt). \n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫(2ω^2 * e^(jωt) dω) = ω^2 * (1/jt) * e^(jωt) - ∫(2ω * (1/jt) * e^(jωt) dω)\n\nNow, we need to solve the second integral in the expression above, which is the same as the second integral in the x(t) expression. So, let's move on to the second integral and solve it first.\n\n2. ∫(3ω * e^(jωt) dω):\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts again. Let u = ω and dv = 3 * e^(jωt) dω. Then, du = dω and v = (1/jt) * e^(jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫(3ω * e^(jωt) dω) = ω * (1/jt) * e^(jωt) - ∫((1/jt) * e^(jωt) dω)\n\nNow, we need to solve the third integral in the expression above, which is the same as the third integral in the x(t) expression. So, let's move on to the third integral and solve it.\n\n3. ∫(4 * e^(jωt) dω):\n\nThis integral is straightforward:\n\n∫(4 * e^(jωt) dω) = (4/jt) * e^(jωt)\n\nNow, we have all the integrals needed to compute x(t):\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * [ω^2 * (1/jt) * e^(jωt) - (ω * (1/jt) * e^(jωt) - ∫((1/jt) * e^(jωt) dω)) + (4/jt) * e^(jωt)]\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * [(ω^2 - ω + 4) * (1/jt) * e^(jωt) - ∫((1/jt) * e^(jωt) dω)]\n\nNow, we need to take the limit as ω goes to infinity and subtract the limit as ω goes to negative infinity:\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * lim(ω→∞) [(ω^2 - ω + 4) * (1/jt) * e^(jωt)] - (1 / (2π)) * lim(ω→-∞) [(ω^2 - ω + 4) * (1/jt) * e^(jωt)]\n\nUnfortunately, these limits do not converge, which means that the inverse Fourier transform of the given signal X(ω) does not exist."
