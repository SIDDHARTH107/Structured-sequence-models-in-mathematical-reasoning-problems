    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the partition formula: p(5) = 7 and p(1) = 1, so there are 7 * 1 = 7 abelian groups.\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of a given order: gcd(5, 2^5 - 1) * gcd(1, 3^1 - 1) = gcd(5, 31) * gcd(1, 2) = 1 * 1 = 1. This means there is 1 non-abelian group of order 96.\n\nSo, there are a total of 7 abelian groups + 1 non-abelian group = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
