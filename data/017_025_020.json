Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order.\n\nStep 1: Prime factorization of 120\n120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n\nStep 2: Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order\nThe formula for the number of groups of order n is given by:\n\nn(G) = (p^a - 1) * (p^b - 1) * (p^c - 1) * ...\n\nwhere n(G) is the number of groups of order G, p^a, p^b, and p^c are the prime factors of the order, and the formula is applied to each prime factor.\n\nFor our case, we have:\n\nn(120) = (2^3 - 1) * (3 - 1) * (5 - 1)\nn(120) = (8 - 1) * (2) * (4)\nn(120) = 7 * 2 * 4\nn(120) = 14 * 4\nn(120) = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
