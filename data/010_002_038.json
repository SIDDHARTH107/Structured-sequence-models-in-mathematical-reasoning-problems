    "message_2": "To show that the sequence (a_n) = (1/n) converges to zero with respect to the subspace topology on S, we need to show that for any open set U in the subspace topology containing 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, a_n is in U.\n\nRecall that the subspace topology on S is defined by the collection of open sets U ∩ S, where U is an open set in the original topology on X (the standard topology on the real numbers in this case). Since 0 is in S, we can consider open sets in the standard topology containing 0.\n\nLet U be an open set in the standard topology containing 0. By definition of the standard topology, there exists an open interval (a, b) containing 0 such that (a, b) ⊆ U. Since 0 is in this interval, we have -b < 0 < b for some positive real number b.\n\nNow, we need to find a natural number N such that for all n > N, a_n = 1/n is in U. Since 1/n > 0 for all n, we only need to ensure that 1/n < b. By the Archimedean property of real numbers, there exists a natural number N such that 1/N < b. \n\nFor all n > N, we have 1/n < 1/N < b, so a_n = 1/n is in the interval (a, b) and thus in U. Since U was an arbitrary open set containing 0 in the subspace topology on S, this shows that the sequence (a_n) = (1/n) converges to zero with respect to the subspace topology on S."
