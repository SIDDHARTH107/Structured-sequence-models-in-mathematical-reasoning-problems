    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method for finding the roots of a real-valued function. The formula for the method is:\n\nx_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5, we first need to find its derivative f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method with the initial guess x_0 = 2:\n\nx_1 = x_0 - f(x_0) / f'(x_0)\nx_1 = 2 - (2^3 - 2*2 - 5) / (3*(2^2) - 2)\nx_1 = 2 - (8 - 4 - 5) / (12 - 2)\nx_1 = 2 - (-1) / 10\nx_1 = 2.1\n\nNow, we repeat the process until we reach the desired accuracy of four decimal places:\n\nx_2 = x_1 - f(x_1) / f'(x_1)\nx_2 = 2.1 - (2.1^3 - 2*2.1 - 5) / (3*(2.1^2) - 2)\nx_2 ≈ 2.0952\n\nx_3 = x_2 - f(x_2) / f'(x_2)\nx_3 = 2.0952 - (2.0952^3 - 2*2.0952 - 5) / (3*(2.0952^2) - 2)\nx_3 ≈ 2.0951\n\nSince x_2 and x_3 are equal up to four decimal places, we can stop the iteration process. Therefore, the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5, correct to four decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 2.0951."
