    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has 35 elements. The prime factorization of 35 is 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are distinct prime numbers. According to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, the structure of a finite abelian group is determined by its order's prime factorization. \n\nIn this case, we have two prime factors, 5 and 7. There are two possible group structures for a group of order 35:\n\n1. A direct product of two cyclic groups, one of order 5 and the other of order 7: \n   This group structure can be denoted as C_5 x C_7, where C_n represents a cyclic group of order n. In this structure, the group is abelian, and every element can be written as a product of an element from C_5 and an element from C_7.\n\n2. A single cyclic group of order 35:\n   This group structure can be denoted as C_35. In this structure, the group is also abelian, and there is a single generator element that can generate all other elements in the group by taking its powers.\n\nSince both structures are abelian, there are no non-abelian group structures for a group of order 35. The possible group structures correspond to the prime factorization of 35 as follows:\n\n- The direct product of two cyclic groups, C_5 x C_7, corresponds to the product of the two prime factors, 5 and 7.\n- The single cyclic group of order 35, C_35, corresponds to the product of the prime factors, 5 * 7 = 35."
