    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology of the scalar function $f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2$ restricted to the square, we first need to find the critical points of the function and their indices. The critical points are the solutions to the system of equations given by the partial derivatives of the function:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2y = 0$\n\nThe only solution to this system is $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, which is inside the square. Thus, there is only one critical point, and its Morse index is given by the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are $2$ and $-2$, so the Morse index of the critical point $(0, 0)$ is $1$.\n\nNow we can compute the Morse homology groups. Since there is only one critical point, the Morse complex is given by:\n\n$C_0 = 0$\n\n$C_1 = \\mathbb{F}$\n\n$C_k = 0$ for $k \\neq 1$\n\nThe boundary operator $\\partial_k$ is trivial for all $k$, so the homology groups are given by:\n\n$H_0 = \\text{ker}(\\partial_0) / \\text{im}(\\partial_1) = 0 / 0 = 0$\n\n$H_1 = \\text{ker}(\\partial_1) / \\text{im}(\\partial_2) = \\mathbb{F} / 0 = \\mathbb{F}$\n\n$H_k = 0$ for $k \\neq 0, 1$\n\nThus, the Morse homology of the scalar function $f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2$ restricted to the square using field coefficients is:\n\n$H_0 = 0$\n\n$H_1 = \\mathbb{F}$\n\n$H_k = 0$ for $k \\neq 0, 1$"
