    "message_1": "A company has to choose between two investments that will yield different returns. Investment A has a 30% chance of getting a 10% return and a 70% chance of getting a 5% return. Investment B has a 50% chance of getting a 7% return and a 50% chance of getting a 3% return. Which investment should the company choose? Calculate the expected return for each investment and make a recommendation.",
    "message_2": "To determine which investment the company should choose, we need to calculate the expected return for each investment. The expected return is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the corresponding return and then summing up the results.\n\nFor Investment A:\nExpected Return = (0.3 * 10%) + (0.7 * 5%)\nExpected Return = (0.3 * 0.1) + (0.7 * 0.05)\nExpected Return = 0.03 + 0.035\nExpected Return = 0.065 or 6.5%\n\nFor Investment B:\nExpected Return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 3%)\nExpected Return = (0.5 * 0.07) + (0.5 * 0.03)\nExpected Return = 0.035 + 0.015\nExpected Return = 0.05 or 5%\n\nBased on the expected returns, Investment A has a higher expected return of 6.5% compared to Investment B's expected return of 5%. Therefore, the company should choose Investment A."
