    "message_2": "To find the total number of points on the elliptic curve Y^2 = X^3 - 3X + 5 over the field F_7, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible x values in the field F_7 (i.e., 0 to 6).\n2. For each x value, compute the right-hand side of the equation (X^3 - 3X + 5) modulo 7.\n3. Check if the result is a quadratic residue modulo 7 (i.e., if there exists a y value in F_7 such that y^2 is congruent to the result modulo 7).\n4. If it is a quadratic residue, there are two points on the curve for that x value (one for each of the two possible y values). If not, there are no points on the curve for that x value.\n5. Add the point at infinity.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. The possible x values in F_7 are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n2. Compute the right-hand side of the equation for each x value modulo 7:\n   - For x = 0: (0^3 - 3*0 + 5) mod 7 = 5\n   - For x = 1: (1^3 - 3*1 + 5) mod 7 = 3\n   - For x = 2: (2^3 - 3*2 + 5) mod 7 = 6\n   - For x = 3: (3^3 - 3*3 + 5) mod 7 = 1\n   - For x = 4: (4^3 - 3*4 + 5) mod 7 = 2\n   - For x = 5: (5^3 - 3*5 + 5) mod 7 = 4\n   - For x = 6: (6^3 - 3*6 + 5) mod 7 = 0\n\n3. Check if the results are quadratic residues modulo 7:\n   - Quadratic residues modulo 7 are {0, 1, 2, 4}.\n   - For x = 0: 5 is not a quadratic residue.\n   - For x = 1: 3 is not a quadratic residue.\n   - For x = 2: 6 is not a quadratic residue.\n   - For x = 3: 1 is a quadratic residue.\n   - For x = 4: 2 is a quadratic residue.\n   - For x = 5: 4 is a quadratic residue.\n   - For x = 6: 0 is a quadratic residue.\n\n4. Count the number of points for each x value:\n   - For x = 0: 0 points\n   - For x = 1: 0 points\n   - For x = 2: 0 points\n   - For x = 3: 2 points (y = 3 and y = 4)\n   - For x = 4: 2 points (y = 1 and y = 6)\n   - For x = 5: 2 points (y = 2 and y = 5)\n   - For x = 6: 2 points (y = 0 and y = 0)\n\n5. Add the point at infinity:\n   - Total number of points = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 (point at infinity) = 9 points.\n\nSo, there are 9 points on the elliptic curve Y^2 = X^3 - 3X + 5 over the field F_7, including the point at infinity."
