    "message_2": "In a compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold, the Hodge diamond is symmetric, and the Hodge numbers h^{p,q} are equal to h^{3-p,3-q}. The dimension of the vector space of holomorphic 2-forms is given by the Hodge number h^{2,0}.\n\nSince h^{2,1} = 303, we have h^{1,2} = 303 as well. Now, we can use the symmetry of the Hodge diamond to find h^{2,0}:\n\nh^{2,0} = h^{1,1} = 101\n\nThus, the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic 2-forms on this compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold is 101."
