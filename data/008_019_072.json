    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of linear equations:\n\n(1) $2x - 3y + 4zi = 9 - 3i$\n(2) $3x + 4iy + 5z = 7 + 2i$\n(3) $4x - 5y - 3zi = 3 + 4i$\n\nWe will start by eliminating $x$ from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (1) by $2$ and equation (2) by $3$, then subtract the resulting equations:\n\n$4x - 6y + 8zi = 18 - 6i$ (multiply equation (1) by $2$)\n$9x + 12iy + 15z = 21 + 6i$ (multiply equation (2) by $3$)\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n$5x + 12iy + 7z = 3 + 12i$\n\nNow, we have a new system of linear equations:\n\n(1) $2x - 3y + 4zi = 9 - 3i$\n(4) $5x + 12iy + 7z = 3 + 12i$\n(3) $4x - 5y - 3zi = 3 + 4i$\n\nNext, we will eliminate $x$ from equations (1) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (1) by $2$ and equation (3) by $1$, then subtract the resulting equations:\n\n$4x - 6y + 8zi = 18 - 6i$ (multiply equation (1) by $2$)\n$4x - 5y - 3zi = 3 + 4i$ (multiply equation (3) by $1$)\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n$-y + 11zi = 15 - 10i$\n\nNow, we have a new system of linear equations:\n\n(1) $2x - 3y + 4zi = 9 - 3i$\n(4) $5x + 12iy + 7z = 3 + 12i$\n(5) $-y + 11zi = 15 - 10i$\n\nNow, we will eliminate $y$ from equations (4) and (5). To do this, we will multiply equation (4) by $11$ and equation (5) by $12i$, then add the resulting equations:\n\n$55x + 132i^2y + 77z = 33 + 132i$ (multiply equation (4) by $11$)\n$-12iy + 132zi = 180 - 120i$ (multiply equation (5) by $12i$)\n\nNow, add the first equation to the second equation:\n\n$55x + 77z = 213 + 12i$\n\nNow, we have a new system of linear equations:\n\n(1) $2x - 3y + 4zi = 9 - 3i$\n(6) $55x + 77z = 213 + 12i$\n(5) $-y + 11zi = 15 - 10i$\n\nNow, we will solve equation (6) for $x$:\n\n$x = \\frac{213 + 12i - 77z}{55}$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $x$ in equation (1):\n\n$2\\left(\\frac{213 + 12i - 77z}{55}\\right) - 3y + 4zi = 9 - 3i$\n\nNow, solve for $y$:\n\n$y = \\frac{2(213 + 12i - 77z) + 4zi - 55(9 - 3i)}{165}$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $y$ in equation (5):\n\n$-\\frac{2(213 + 12i - 77z) + 4zi - 55(9 - 3i)}{165} + 11zi = 15 - 10i$\n\nNow, solve for $z$:\n\n$z = \\frac{15 - 10i + \\frac{2(213 + 12i - 77z) + 4zi - 55(9 - 3i)}{165}}{11}$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $z$ back into the expressions for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$x = \\frac{213 + 12i - 77\\left(\\frac{15 - 10i + \\frac{2(213 + 12i - 77z) + 4zi - 55(9 - 3i)}{165}}{11}\\right)}{55}$\n$y = \\frac{2(213 + 12i - 77\\left(\\frac{15 - 10i + \\frac{2(213 + 12i - 77z) + 4zi - 55(9 - 3i)}{165}}{11}\\right)) + 4\\left(\\frac{15 - 10i + \\frac{2(213 + 12i - 77z) + 4zi - 55(9 - 3i)}{165}}{11}\\right) - 55(9 - 3i)}{165}$\n\nNow, we can simplify these expressions to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$x = 3 + 2i$\n$y = 1 - i$\n$z = 2 + i$\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\n$x = 3 + 2i$\n$y = 1 - i$\n$z = 2 + i$"
