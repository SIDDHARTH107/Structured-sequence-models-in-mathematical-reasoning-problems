    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a ciphertext that has been encrypted using the Hill Cipher with a key matrix of {{3, 2}, {1, 4}}. The ciphertext is \"NQOF\". Determine the plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt a message encrypted with the Hill Cipher, we first need to find the inverse of the key matrix. The given key matrix is:\n\nK = | 3  2 |\n    | 1  4 |\n\nTo find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we use the formula:\n\nK_inv = (1/det(K)) * adj(K)\n\nwhere det(K) is the determinant of the matrix K and adj(K) is the adjugate of K.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of K:\n\ndet(K) = (3 * 4) - (2 * 1) = 12 - 2 = 10\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of K:\n\nadj(K) = |  4  -2 |\n         | -1   3 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of K by multiplying the adjugate by the reciprocal of the determinant:\n\nK_inv = (1/10) * adj(K) = |  2/5  -1/5  |\n                          | -1/10  3/10 |\n\nNow that we have the inverse key matrix, we can decrypt the ciphertext \"NQOF\". First, we need to convert the letters to numbers using the convention A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25:\n\nNQOF = 13 16 14 5\n\nWe group the numbers into 2x1 matrices:\n\n| 13 |  | 14 |\n| 16 |  |  5 |\n\nNow, we multiply the inverse key matrix by each of these matrices:\n\nK_inv * | 13 |  = |  2/5  -1/5  | * | 13 | = |  1  |\n        | 16 |    | -1/10  3/10 |   | 16 |   |  0  |\n\nK_inv * | 14 |  = |  2/5  -1/5  | * | 14 | = | 17  |\n        |  5 |    | -1/10  3/10 |   |  5 |   |  4  |\n\nNow, we convert the resulting numbers back to letters:\n\n1 0 17 4 = BAKE\n\nSo, the plaintext message is \"BAKE\"."
