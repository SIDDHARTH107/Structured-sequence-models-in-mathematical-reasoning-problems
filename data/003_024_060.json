    "message_1": "A boat is moving in a direction that makes an angle of 30 degrees with the north direction. The boat has a speed of 20 km/hour. What is the component of the velocity of the boat in the north direction? Use trigonometry to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the component of the velocity of the boat in the north direction, we can use the cosine function in trigonometry. The cosine function relates the angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the adjacent side (in this case, the northward component of the velocity) to the hypotenuse (the total velocity of the boat).\n\nThe formula we will use is:\n\nNorthward component of velocity = Total velocity × cos(angle)\n\nIn this problem, the total velocity is 20 km/hour, and the angle is 30 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians, as the trigonometric functions in most calculators and programming languages use radians:\n\nRadians = (Degrees × π) / 180\nRadians = (30 × π) / 180\nRadians ≈ 0.5236\n\nNow, we can find the northward component of the velocity:\n\nNorthward component of velocity = 20 × cos(0.5236)\nNorthward component of velocity ≈ 20 × 0.866\nNorthward component of velocity ≈ 17.32 km/hour\n\nSo, the component of the velocity of the boat in the north direction is approximately 17.32 km/hour."
