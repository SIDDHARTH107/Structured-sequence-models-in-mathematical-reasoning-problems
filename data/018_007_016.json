    "message_2": "Let A be a set of 5 distinct elements, i.e., A = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}. The power set of A, denoted by P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.\n\nThe number of elements in the power set of A can be determined using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the original set A. In this case, n = 5, so the number of elements in the power set of A is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's compare the number of elements in the power set of A with the number of elements in A. The set A has 5 elements, while the power set of A has 32 elements. Clearly, the power set of A is larger than the set A itself.\n\nTo prove that the power set of A is always larger than the set A itself, let's consider a set B with n distinct elements. The power set of B, denoted by P(B), has 2^n elements. We want to show that 2^n > n for all n.\n\nWe can prove this by induction:\n\nBase case: For n = 1, we have 2^1 = 2 > 1. So, the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that 2^k > k for some positive integer k. We want to show that 2^(k+1) > k + 1.\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k (by the properties of exponents)\n\nSince 2^k > k (by the inductive hypothesis), we have:\n\n2 * 2^k > 2 * k\n\nNow, we need to show that 2 * k > k + 1. This is equivalent to showing that k > 1, which is true for all k â‰¥ 2.\n\nThus, by induction, we have proven that the power set of A is always larger than the set A itself for all sets A with a finite number of elements."
