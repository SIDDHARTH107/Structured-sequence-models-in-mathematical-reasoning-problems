    "message_2": "The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 - a * x_n^2 + y_n\ny_{n+1} = b * x_n\n\nwhere x_n and y_n are the coordinates of the point at iteration n, and a and b are parameters. In this case, a = 1.4 and b = 0.3.\n\nThe basin of attraction for the Hénon map is the set of initial points (x_0, y_0) that, when iterated through the map, converge to a fixed point or a periodic orbit. For the given parameters, the Hénon map exhibits chaotic behavior, and the basin of attraction is a fractal set.\n\nTo find the basin of attraction, one can use numerical methods such as iterating the map for a large number of points in the plane and checking their convergence. However, due to the chaotic nature of the Hénon map, it is difficult to provide an explicit description of the basin of attraction."
