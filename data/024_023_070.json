    "message_2": "To show that the manifold M is invariant under translation by the vector (1, 1, 1), we need to show that the new coordinates obtained by translating the original coordinates by (1, 1, 1) still satisfy the parametrization of M.\n\nLet's denote the translated coordinates as (u', v'):\n\nu' = u + 1\nv' = v + 1\n\nNow, we need to find the new x, y, and z coordinates in terms of u' and v':\n\nx(u', v') = u' - 1 = (u + 1) - 1 = u\ny(u', v') = v' - 1 = (v + 1) - 1 = v\nz(u', v') = (u' - 1) + (v' - 1) = (u + 1 - 1) + (v + 1 - 1) = u + v\n\nAs we can see, the new coordinates x(u', v'), y(u', v'), and z(u', v') still satisfy the parametrization of M. Therefore, M is invariant under translation by the vector (1, 1, 1).\n\nNow, let's determine the corresponding Lie group of symmetries of M. Since M is invariant under translation by the vector (1, 1, 1), the Lie group of symmetries of M is the group of translations along the (1, 1, 1) direction. This group can be parametrized by a single parameter t, where the translation is given by:\n\n(u, v) -> (u + t, v + t)\n\nThe corresponding Lie group is a one-dimensional Abelian group, which is isomorphic to the additive group of real numbers (R, +)."
