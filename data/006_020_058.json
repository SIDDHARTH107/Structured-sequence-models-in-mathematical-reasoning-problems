    "message_1": "In a certain community, there are 50 teenagers. The probability of a teenager owning a smartphone is 0.8 and the probability of a teenager owning a car is 0.2. What is the probability that a teenager in the community owns both a smartphone and a car?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a teenager owning both a smartphone and a car, we need to multiply the individual probabilities together, assuming that the events are independent (meaning that owning a smartphone does not affect the probability of owning a car, and vice versa).\n\nProbability of owning both a smartphone and a car = (probability of owning a smartphone) * (probability of owning a car)\n\nProbability of owning both = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16\n\nSo, the probability that a teenager in the community owns both a smartphone and a car is 0.16 or 16%."
