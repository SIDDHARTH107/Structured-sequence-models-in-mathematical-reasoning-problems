The bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. If the bottom of the ladder is initially 8 feet from the wall, and the ladder is 10 feet long, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall at the instant when the bottom is 6 feet from the wall? (Round your answer to 2 decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that dx/dt = 2 ft/s (the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall).\n\nWe are also given that the ladder is 10 feet long, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\nx^2 + y^2 = 100\n\nNow, we want to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 6 ft. To do this, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe know that dx/dt = 2 ft/s, and we want to find dy/dt when x = 6 ft. First, we need to find the value of y when x = 6 ft. We can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 100\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -24\ndy/dt = -24/16\ndy/dt = -1.5\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 1.5 feet per second when the bottom is 6 feet from the wall."
