    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin that pass through the points (3,4,0) and (0,4,3), we can use the fact that geodesics on a sphere are great circles. A great circle is the intersection of a sphere with a plane that passes through the center of the sphere.\n\nLet's denote the two points as A(3,4,0) and B(0,4,3). The center of the sphere is C(0,0,0). We need to find the plane that passes through points A, B, and C.\n\nThe vector CA can be represented as:\nCA = A - C = (3,4,0)\n\nThe vector CB can be represented as:\nCB = B - C = (0,4,3)\n\nNow, we need to find the normal vector to the plane passing through A, B, and C. We can do this by taking the cross product of CA and CB:\n\nN = CA × CB = (3,4,0) × (0,4,3) = (12,-9,12)\n\nNow we have the normal vector N(12,-9,12) to the plane. The equation of the plane can be written as:\n\n12x - 9y + 12z = D\n\nTo find the value of D, we can plug in the coordinates of any of the three points (A, B, or C) into the equation. Let's use point A(3,4,0):\n\n12(3) - 9(4) + 12(0) = D\n36 - 36 = D\nD = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is:\n\n12x - 9y + 12z = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this plane with the sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin. The equation of the sphere is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 5^2 = 25\n\nWe can solve the system of equations to find the intersection:\n\n12x - 9y + 12z = 0\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nFrom the plane equation, we can express x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = (9y - 12z) / 12\n\nSubstitute this expression for x into the sphere equation:\n\n[((9y - 12z) / 12)^2] + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(9y^2 - 24yz + 144z^2) / 144 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nMultiply by 144 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n9y^2 - 24yz + 144z^2 + 144y^2 + 144z^2 = 3600\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n153y^2 + 288z^2 - 24yz = 3600\n\nThis is the equation representing the intersection of the plane and the sphere, which is the great circle (geodesic) passing through points A(3,4,0) and B(0,4,3) on the surface of the sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin."
