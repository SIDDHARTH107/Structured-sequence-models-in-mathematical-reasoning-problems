    "message_1": "Suppose there are 6 people at a party. Each person shakes hands with exactly two other people. How many handshakes take place in total?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider each person and the number of handshakes they make. Since each person shakes hands with exactly two other people, we can represent the handshakes as follows:\n\nPerson 1: 2 handshakes\nPerson 2: 2 handshakes\nPerson 3: 2 handshakes\nPerson 4: 2 handshakes\nPerson 5: 2 handshakes\nPerson 6: 2 handshakes\n\nNow, we need to be careful not to double count the handshakes. When Person 1 shakes hands with Person 2, that handshake is counted for both Person 1 and Person 2. So, we need to divide the total number of handshakes by 2 to account for this double counting.\n\nTotal handshakes = (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6 handshakes."
