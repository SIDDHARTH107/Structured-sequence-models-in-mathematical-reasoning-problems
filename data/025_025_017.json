    "message_2": "Let P(x, y) be a point on the locus. Let A(0, 4) and B(0, -4) be the given points. We are given that the sum of the squares of the distances from P to A and P to B is equal to 80. That is,\n\nPA^2 + PB^2 = 80\n\nUsing the distance formula, we can write the distances PA and PB as follows:\n\nPA^2 = (x - 0)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = x^2 + (y - 4)^2\nPB^2 = (x - 0)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = x^2 + (y + 4)^2\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the given equation:\n\nx^2 + (y - 4)^2 + x^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 80\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2x^2 + 2(y^2 - 16y + 16) + 2(y^2 + 8y + 16) = 80\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x^2 + 4y^2 - 16y + 32 + 8y + 32 = 80\n\nSimplify further:\n\n2x^2 + 4y^2 - 8y + 64 = 80\n\nSubtract 80 from both sides:\n\n2x^2 + 4y^2 - 8y - 16 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 2:\n\nx^2 + 2y^2 - 4y - 8 = 0\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nx^2 + 2(y^2 - 2y) = 8\n\nNow, complete the square for the y terms:\n\nx^2 + 2(y - 1)^2 - 2 = 8\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\nx^2 + 2(y - 1)^2 = 10\n\nFinally, divide by 10:\n\n(x^2)/10 + (y - 1)^2/5 = 1\n\nThis is the equation of an ellipse with center at (0, 1), major axis parallel to the x-axis, and semi-major axis a = sqrt(10) and semi-minor axis b = sqrt(5)."
