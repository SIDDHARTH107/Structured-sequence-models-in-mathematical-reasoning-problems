    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x + 1 on the interval [0, 2π], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ.\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\na₀ = (1/(2π)) * ∫(x + 1) dx from 0 to 2π\n\na₀ = (1/(2π)) * [(1/2)x^2 + x] evaluated from 0 to 2π\n\na₀ = (1/(2π)) * [(1/2)(2π)^2 + 2π] = (1/(2π)) * (2π^2 + 2π)\n\na₀ = π + 1\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫(x + 1)cos(nx) dx from 0 to 2π\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\naₙ = (1/π) * [(x + 1) * (1/n)sin(nx) - ∫(1/n)sin(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(x + 1) * (1/n)sin(nx) + (1/n^2)cos(nx)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\naₙ = (1/π) * [(2π + 1) * (1/n)sin(2πn) + (1/n^2)cos(2πn) - (1/n)sin(0) - (1/n^2)cos(0)]\n\nSince sin(2πn) = 0 and cos(2πn) = 1 for all integer values of n, we have:\naₙ = (1/π) * [0 + (1/n^2)(1) - 0 - (1/n^2)(1)]\n\naₙ = 0\n\nNow, let's find bₙ:\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫(x + 1)sin(nx) dx from 0 to 2π\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\nbₙ = (1/π) * [-(x + 1) * (1/n)cos(nx) - ∫-(1/n)cos(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [-(x + 1) * (1/n)cos(nx) + (1/n^2)sin(nx)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\nbₙ = (1/π) * [-(2π + 1) * (1/n)cos(2πn) + (1/n^2)sin(2πn) - (1/n)cos(0) - (1/n^2)sin(0)]\n\nSince sin(2πn) = 0 and cos(2πn) = 1 for all integer values of n, we have:\nbₙ = (1/π) * [-(2π + 1) * (1/n)(1) + 0 - (1/n)(1) - 0]\n\nbₙ = -(1 + 2π/n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x + 1 on the interval [0, 2π] as:\n\nf(x) ≈ a₀/2 + Σ[0 * cos(nx) - (1 + 2π/n) * sin(nx)] from n=1 to infinity\n\nf(x) ≈ (π + 1)/2 - Σ[(1 + 2π/n) * sin(nx)] from n=1 to infinity"
