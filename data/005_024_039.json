    "message_1": "Suppose a data analyst has a data set of 50 observations. The mean of the data set is 12 and the standard deviation is 5. Calculate the z-score for an observation that has a value of 18.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the z-score for an observation with a value of 18, we use the following formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere z is the z-score, X is the observation value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 18, μ = 12, and σ = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (18 - 12) / 5\nz = 6 / 5\nz = 1.2\n\nSo, the z-score for an observation with a value of 18 is 1.2."
