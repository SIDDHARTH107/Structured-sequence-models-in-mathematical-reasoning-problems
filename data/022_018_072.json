    "message_2": "First, let's find the partial derivatives of f(z) with respect to x and y:\n\nf(z) = (x + iy)² + i cos(x + iy) = x² - y² + i(2xy) + i(cos(x)cosh(y) - i sin(x)sinh(y))\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x + i(2y) - sin(x)cosh(y) - i cos(x)sinh(y)\n∂f/∂y = -2y + i(2x) + cos(x)sinh(y) + i sin(x)cosh(y)\n\nNow, let's plug these partial derivatives into Equation 1:\n\n(2x - sin(x)cosh(y)) + i(2y + cos(x)sinh(y)) = 0\n\nSince the real and imaginary parts must be separately equal to zero, we have:\n\n2x - sin(x)cosh(y) = 0  (Real part)\n2y + cos(x)sinh(y) = 0  (Imaginary part)\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 2 - cos(x)cosh(y) + sin(x)sinh(y)\n∂²f/∂y² = -2 + cos(x)cosh(y) - sin(x)sinh(y)\n\nNow, let's plug these second partial derivatives into Equation 2:\n\n(2 - cos(x)cosh(y) + sin(x)sinh(y)) + (-2 + cos(x)cosh(y) - sin(x)sinh(y)) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied, so f(z) is indeed a valid complex potential for the flow.\n\nNow, let's find the stream function ψ(x, y) for the flow. Since the flow is irrotational, we know that:\n\n∂ψ/∂x = Im(∂f/∂y) = 2x + cos(x)sinh(y)\n∂ψ/∂y = -Re(∂f/∂x) = -2y + sin(x)cosh(y)\n\nNow, we can integrate these equations to find ψ(x, y):\n\nψ(x, y) = ∫(2x + cos(x)sinh(y)) dx = x² + sin(x)sinh(y) + C(y)\n\nTo find C(y), we differentiate ψ(x, y) with respect to y and compare it to the given ∂ψ/∂y:\n\n∂ψ/∂y = cos(x)cosh(y) + C'(y) = -2y + sin(x)cosh(y)\n\nComparing the two expressions, we find that C'(y) = -2y, so C(y) = -y² + K, where K is a constant.\n\nThus, the stream function ψ(x, y) is given by:\n\nψ(x, y) = x² + sin(x)sinh(y) - y² + K\n\nFinally, let's find the harmonic conjugate of f(z). A harmonic conjugate, g(z), satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂f/∂x = ∂g/∂y\n∂f/∂y = -∂g/∂x\n\nUsing the partial derivatives of f(z) we found earlier:\n\n∂g/∂y = 2x - sin(x)cosh(y)\n-∂g/∂x = 2y + cos(x)sinh(y)\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to y, we get:\n\ng(z) = 2xy - sin(x)cosh(y) + C(x)\n\nNow, differentiating g(z) with respect to x and comparing it to the second equation:\n\n∂g/∂x = 2y - cos(x)cosh(y) + C'(x) = -2y - cos(x)sinh(y)\n\nComparing the two expressions, we find that C'(x) = -cos(x)sinh(y) - cos(x)cosh(y), so C(x) = -sin(x)sinh(y) + K', where K' is a constant.\n\nThus, the harmonic conjugate of f(z) is given by:\n\ng(z) = 2xy - sin(x)cosh(y) - sin(x)sinh(y) + K'\n\nIn conclusion, the complex potential f(z) = x² - y² + i(2xy) + i(cos(x)cosh(y) - i sin(x)sinh(y)) satisfies the given partial differential equations, the stream function ψ(x, y) = x² + sin(x)sinh(y) - y² + K, and the harmonic conjugate of f(z) is g(z) = 2xy - sin(x)cosh(y) - sin(x)sinh(y) + K'."
