    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular garden, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is 14 meters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 7 meters.\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 7\nC ≈ 43.98226 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is approximately 43.98 meters."
