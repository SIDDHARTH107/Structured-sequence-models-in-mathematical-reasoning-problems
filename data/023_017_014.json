    "message_2": "To find the maximum velocity in the fluid, we need to find the maximum value of the velocity function $v(y) = 5\\cos(\\pi y/2)$. To do this, we can find the critical points of the function by taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it equal to zero.\n\nThe derivative of $v(y)$ with respect to $y$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{dv}{dy} = -\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi y}{2})$$\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n$$-\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi y}{2}) = 0$$\n\nThe sine function is zero when its argument is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\pi y}{2} = n\\pi$$\n\nWhere $n$ is an integer. Solving for $y$, we get:\n\n$$y = 2n$$\n\nSince $y$ represents the distance from the centerline of the pipe, we are only interested in the values of $y$ that are within the pipe. Assuming the pipe has a radius $R$, we are looking for values of $y$ such that $-R \\leq y \\leq R$. \n\nFor $n=0$, we have $y=0$, which corresponds to the centerline of the pipe. This is a valid value for $y$, and we can plug it back into the velocity function to find the maximum velocity:\n\n$$v_{max} = v(0) = 5\\cos(\\pi \\cdot 0/2) = 5\\cos(0) = 5 \\text{ m/s}$$\n\nThus, the maximum velocity in the fluid is 5 m/s, and it occurs at the centerline of the pipe, where $y=0$."
