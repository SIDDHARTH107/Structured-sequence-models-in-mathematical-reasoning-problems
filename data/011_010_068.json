    "message_1": "In a room, there are 8 people. In how many ways can these people sit in a circular table such that no two neighbors are a couple? (Assuming that there are 4 couples in the room)",
    "message_2": "We will use the concept of Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to solve this problem.\n\nLet's denote the couples as (A1, A2), (B1, B2), (C1, C2), and (D1, D2).\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table. Since there is no starting point in a circle, we have (8-1)! ways to arrange them, which is 7! = 5040 ways.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways in which at least one couple sits together. We can treat each couple as a single entity. So, we have 6 entities (4 couples and 2 single persons) to arrange in a circle, which can be done in (6-1)! = 5! = 120 ways. However, within each couple, they can switch places, so we have 2! ways for each couple. Therefore, there are 120 * 2^4 = 1920 ways in which at least one couple sits together.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways in which at least two couples sit together. We can treat the two couples as two single entities. So, we have 5 entities (2 couples and 3 single persons) to arrange in a circle, which can be done in (5-1)! = 4! = 24 ways. However, within each couple, they can switch places, so we have 2! ways for each couple. Also, we have 4C2 ways to choose 2 couples out of 4. Therefore, there are 24 * 2^2 * 6 = 576 ways in which at least two couples sit together.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways in which at least three couples sit together. We can treat the three couples as three single entities. So, we have 4 entities (3 couples and 1 single person) to arrange in a circle, which can be done in (4-1)! = 3! = 6 ways. However, within each couple, they can switch places, so we have 2! ways for each couple. Also, we have 4C3 ways to choose 3 couples out of 4. Therefore, there are 6 * 2^3 * 4 = 192 ways in which at least three couples sit together.\n\nFinally, let's find the number of ways in which all four couples sit together. We can treat the four couples as four single entities. So, we have 4 entities to arrange in a circle, which can be done in (4-1)! = 3! = 6 ways. However, within each couple, they can switch places, so we have 2! ways for each couple. Therefore, there are 6 * 2^4 = 96 ways in which all four couples sit together.\n\nNow, we will apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:\n\nTotal ways = All ways - Ways with at least 1 couple together + Ways with at least 2 couples together - Ways with at least 3 couples together + Ways with all 4 couples together\n\nTotal ways = 5040 - 1920 + 576 - 192 + 96 = 2600\n\nSo, there are 2600 ways in which these 8 people can sit in a circular table such that no two neighbors are a couple."
