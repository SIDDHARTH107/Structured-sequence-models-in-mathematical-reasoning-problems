    "message_2": "(a) To find the Fourier transform of f(t), we'll use the following definition:\n\nF(w) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jwt)] dt, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nHowever, since f(t) = 0 for t < 0, we can change the limits of integration to 0 to +∞:\n\nF(w) = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-jwt)] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to +∞.\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nF(w) = ∫[e^(-t(2 + jw))] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to +∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by substitution. Let u = 2 + jw, so du = -dt:\n\nF(w) = -∫[e^(-tu)] du, where the integral is taken from +∞ to 0.\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nF(w) = -[-1/u * e^(-tu)] evaluated from +∞ to 0.\n\nF(w) = 1/(2 + jw) * [e^(-t(2 + jw))] evaluated from +∞ to 0.\n\nAt t = +∞, the exponential term goes to 0, and at t = 0, the exponential term is 1:\n\nF(w) = 1/(2 + jw) * (1 - 0)\n\nF(w) = 1/(2 + jw)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(t) is F(w) = 1/(2 + jw).\n\n(b) Now, we'll find the inverse Fourier transform of F(w) using the following definition:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) * ∫[F(w) * e^(jwt)] dw, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) * ∫[(1/(2 + jw)) * e^(jwt)] dw, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the residue theorem from complex analysis. The function 1/(2 + jw) has a simple pole at w = -j2. We can find the residue at this pole:\n\nResidue = lim(w -> -j2) [(w + j2) * (1/(2 + jw))]\n\nResidue = 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) * 2π * 1/2 * e^(-2t) for t >= 0\n\nf(t) = e^(-2t) for t >= 0\n\nSo, the inverse Fourier transform of F(w) is f(t) = e^(-2t) for t >= 0, which is the original function."
