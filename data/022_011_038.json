    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^3 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation. We can factor it as follows:\n\nz^3 + 1 = (z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the zeros:\n\n1. z + 1 = 0 => z = -1\n\n2. z^2 - z + 1 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nz = (1 ± √(1 - 4(1)(1)))/2 = (1 ± √(-3))/2 = (1 ± i√3)/2\n\nSo, the zeros of f(z) are:\n\nz1 = -1\nz2 = (1 + i√3)/2\nz3 = (1 - i√3)/2\n\nNow, let's find the poles of f(z). A pole occurs when the denominator of the function is zero:\n\nz^2 = 0\n\nThis equation has a double root at z = 0. Therefore, there is a pole of order 2 at z = 0.\n\nIn summary, the zeros of f(z) are:\n\nz1 = -1\nz2 = (1 + i√3)/2\nz3 = (1 - i√3)/2\n\nAnd there is a pole of order 2 at z = 0."
