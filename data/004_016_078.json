    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet's consider the function f(t) representing the position of the car at time t. We are given that the car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. Since speed is the derivative of position with respect to time, we have:\n\nf'(t) = 60 mph\n\nWe want to determine if there was a time during the first 4 hours of the trip when the car was traveling at exactly 50 miles per hour. In other words, we want to find a time t in the interval (0, 4) such that f'(t) = 50 mph.\n\nHowever, we are given that the car travels at a constant speed of 60 mph, which means f'(t) = 60 mph for all t in the interval (0, 4). Since the car's speed never changes, there is no time during the first 4 hours of the trip when the car was traveling at exactly 50 miles per hour."
