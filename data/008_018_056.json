    "message_1": "Suppose that a company produces two products A and B. A requires 3 hours of work on Machine X and 2 hours of work on Machine Y, while B requires 4 hours of work on Machine X and 1 hour of work on Machine Y. If the company has 20 hours of work available on Machine X and 10 hours of work available on Machine Y, determine the maximum number of units of each product that can be produced.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We can set up the following system of inequalities based on the given information:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 20 (Machine X constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 10 (Machine Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of units of each product that can be produced, so we need to find the feasible region of this system of inequalities. To do this, we can graph the inequalities:\n\n1. 3x + 4y ≤ 20\nTo find the boundary line, set the inequality to an equation: 3x + 4y = 20\nWhen x = 0, y = 5\nWhen y = 0, x = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\nPlot the points (0, 5) and (6.67, 0) and draw the line connecting them. Shade the region below the line, as we want values less than or equal to 20.\n\n2. 2x + 1y ≤ 10\nTo find the boundary line, set the inequality to an equation: 2x + 1y = 10\nWhen x = 0, y = 10\nWhen y = 0, x = 5\nPlot the points (0, 10) and (5, 0) and draw the line connecting them. Shade the region below the line, as we want values less than or equal to 10.\n\n3. x ≥ 0\nThis is the vertical line at x = 0. Shade the region to the right of the line.\n\n4. y ≥ 0\nThis is the horizontal line at y = 0. Shade the region above the line.\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all shaded regions overlap. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 5), (5, 0), and (2, 3).\n\nNow we need to check the number of units of each product at each vertex:\n\n(0, 0): 0 units of A and 0 units of B\n(0, 5): 0 units of A and 5 units of B\n(5, 0): 5 units of A and 0 units of B\n(2, 3): 2 units of A and 3 units of B\n\nThe maximum number of units that can be produced is at the vertex (2, 3), where 2 units of product A and 3 units of product B can be produced."
