    "message_1": "Sure, here is a problem for the student to solve:\n\nThe half-life of a radioactive substance is 20 years. If there are initially 500 grams of the substance, how many grams will remain after 60 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 500 grams, the time elapsed is 60 years, and the half-life is 20 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^(60 / 20)\n\nFirst, we need to find the exponent:\n\n60 / 20 = 3\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the formula:\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^3\n\nNext, we need to find the value of (1/2)^3:\n\n(1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nFinally, we can multiply the initial amount by this value to find the final amount:\n\nFinal amount = 500 * 1/8 = 62.5 grams\n\nSo, after 60 years, there will be 62.5 grams of the radioactive substance remaining."
