    "message_1": "A factory produces 1000 light bulbs every hour. Given that on average 5 bulbs are defective per hour, what is the probability of having at least one defective bulb among the next 10 bulbs produced by the factory?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of having at least one defective bulb among the next 10 bulbs, we can first find the probability of having no defective bulbs among the next 10 bulbs and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single bulb being non-defective is:\n(1000 - 5) / 1000 = 995 / 1000 = 0.995\n\nThe probability of all 10 bulbs being non-defective is:\n(0.995)^10 ≈ 0.9512\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least one defective bulb among the next 10 bulbs by subtracting the probability of having no defective bulbs from 1:\n1 - 0.9512 ≈ 0.0488\n\nSo, the probability of having at least one defective bulb among the next 10 bulbs produced by the factory is approximately 0.0488 or 4.88%."
