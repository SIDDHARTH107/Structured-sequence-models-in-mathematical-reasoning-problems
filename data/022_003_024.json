    "message_2": "To compute the integral of a function along a curve in the complex plane, we use the parameterization of the curve and the definition of the complex integral. In this case, the curve C is a circle with center 2i and radius 3. We can parameterize the curve using the polar form:\n\nz(t) = 2i + 3e^(it), where t ∈ [0, 2π]\n\nNow we need to find the derivative of z(t) with respect to t:\n\ndz/dt = 3ie^(it)\n\nNext, we substitute the parameterization of z(t) into the function f(z):\n\nf(z(t)) = (2i + 3e^(it))^2 + 4(2i + 3e^(it)) - 5\n\nNow we can set up the integral:\n\n∫[C] f(z)dz = ∫[0, 2π] f(z(t)) * (dz/dt) dt\n\n= ∫[0, 2π] ((2i + 3e^(it))^2 + 4(2i + 3e^(it)) - 5) * (3ie^(it)) dt\n\nHowever, since f(z) is a polynomial, it is an entire function (analytic everywhere in the complex plane). By Cauchy's integral theorem, the integral of an analytic function over a closed curve is zero. Therefore, the integral of f(z) along the circle C is:\n\n∫[C] f(z)dz = 0"
