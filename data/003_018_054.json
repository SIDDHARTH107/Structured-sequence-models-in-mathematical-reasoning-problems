The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(3cos(4x))/dx\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the outer function (3cos(u)) with respect to u:\n\nd(3cos(u))/du = -3sin(u)\n\nNow, find the derivative of the inner function (4x) with respect to x:\n\nd(4x)/dx = 4\n\nNow, apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (-3sin(u)) * (4)\n\ndy/dx = -12sin(4x)\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx = -12sin(4(π/6))\n\ndy/dx = -12sin(2π/3)\n\ndy/dx ≈ -12*(-√3/2)\n\ndy/dx ≈ 6√3"
