If the sample mean spent amount is Rs. 750 and the sample standard deviation is Rs. 100, find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean spent amount per visit.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean spent amount per visit, we can use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (Rs. 750)\nt = t-score (based on the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom, which is n-1)\ns = sample standard deviation (Rs. 100)\nn = sample size (30)\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score for a 95% confidence level and 29 degrees of freedom (30-1). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the t-score is approximately 2.045.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 750 ± (2.045 * (100 / √30))\n\nCI = 750 ± (2.045 * (100 / 5.477))\n\nCI = 750 ± (2.045 * 18.254)\n\nCI = 750 ± 37.34\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean spent amount per visit is approximately Rs. 712.66 to Rs. 787.34."
