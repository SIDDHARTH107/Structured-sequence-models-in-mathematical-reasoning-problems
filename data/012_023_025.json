    "message_2": "A fully connected clique is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. In a graph with 8 vertices, the maximum number of vertices that can form a fully connected clique depends on the number of edges in the graph.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. In a complete graph with 8 vertices (denoted as K8), the number of edges is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of edges = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices.\n\nFor a graph with 8 vertices:\n\nNumber of edges = 8(8-1)/2 = 8(7)/2 = 28\n\nIn this case, all 8 vertices can form a fully connected clique, as every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. So, the maximum number of vertices that can form a fully connected clique in a graph with 8 vertices is 8."
