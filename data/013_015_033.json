    "message_1": "Here's a numerical question for the math student to solve related to Principal-Agent Problem:\n\nA CEO hires a manager to run a company on their behalf. The manager can choose between a high-risk strategy and a low-risk strategy. The high-risk strategy can generate a profit of $200,000 with a probability of 0.6 and a loss of $100,000 with a probability of 0.4. The low-risk strategy can generate a profit of $100,000 with a probability of 0.9 and a loss of $50,000 with a probability of 0.1. However, the CEO cannot observe which strategy the manager has chosen, and the manager is risk-neutral. If the CEO offers the manager a salary of $120,000, which strategy will the manager choose?\n\nThe math student will need to use game theory and the concept of expected utility to determine the optimal strategy for the manager.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for the manager, we need to calculate the expected utility for both the high-risk and low-risk strategies.\n\nExpected utility for high-risk strategy:\nE(High-Risk) = (0.6 * $200,000) + (0.4 * -$100,000) = $120,000 - $40,000 = $80,000\n\nExpected utility for low-risk strategy:\nE(Low-Risk) = (0.9 * $100,000) + (0.1 * -$50,000) = $90,000 - $5,000 = $85,000\n\nSince the manager is risk-neutral, they will choose the strategy with the higher expected utility. In this case, the low-risk strategy has an expected utility of $85,000, which is higher than the high-risk strategy's expected utility of $80,000.\n\nTherefore, the manager will choose the low-risk strategy."
