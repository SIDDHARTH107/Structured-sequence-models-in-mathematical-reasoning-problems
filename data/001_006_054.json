    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 4x + 1, we first find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2, b = 4, and c = 1.\n\nx = -4 / (2 * 2) = -4 / 4 = -1\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1) + 1 = 2 - 4 + 1 = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-1, -1).\n\nNext, we find the axis of symmetry, which is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. The equation for the axis of symmetry is:\n\nx = -1\n\nNow, we can graph the parabola on the coordinate plane. The parabola will have a vertex at (-1, -1) and will open upwards since the coefficient of the x^2 term (a) is positive. The axis of symmetry will be the vertical line x = -1.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph:\n\n```\ny\n|\n|                 *\n|              *     *\n|           *         *\n|        *             *\n|     *                 *\n|  *                     *\n+----------------------------- x\n  -2  -1   0   1   2   3\n```\n\nThe parabola is symmetric about the vertical line x = -1, and its vertex is at the point (-1, -1)."
