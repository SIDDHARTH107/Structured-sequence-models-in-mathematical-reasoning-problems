    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of producing the product, we need to find the minimum point of the given cubic function. To do this, we will first find the derivative of the function with respect to x, and then set it equal to 0 to find the critical points.\n\nThe given function is:\nC(x) = 0.02x^3 - 0.6x^2 + 100x + 10\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of C(x) with respect to x:\nC'(x) = d/dx (0.02x^3 - 0.6x^2 + 100x + 10)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nC'(x) = 0.06x^2 - 1.2x + 100\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting C'(x) equal to 0:\n0.06x^2 - 1.2x + 100 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 0.06, b = -1.2, and c = 100. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nx = (1.2 ± √((-1.2)^2 - 4(0.06)(100))) / (2(0.06))\n\nx = (1.2 ± √(1.44 - 24)) / 0.12\n\nx = (1.2 ± √(-22.56)) / 0.12\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means that the function C(x) does not have a minimum point.\n\nHowever, we can still find the minimum cost of producing the product by considering the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity. As x gets larger, the term 0.02x^3 will dominate the function, causing the cost to increase without bound. Therefore, the minimum cost of producing the product will occur when the company produces the smallest possible number of units, which is 0 units.\n\nSo, the minimum cost of producing the product is C(0) = 0.02(0)^3 - 0.6(0)^2 + 100(0) + 10 = 10 dollars, and the company should produce 0 units to achieve this minimum cost."
