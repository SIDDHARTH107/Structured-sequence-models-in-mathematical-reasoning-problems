    "message_1": "In a factory, the probability of an employee being injured on any given day is 0.025. If the factory has 80 employees, what is the probability that at least two employees will be injured on a particular day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least two employees will be injured on a particular day, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will find the probability that none or only one employee will be injured and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet P(X) be the probability of X employees being injured.\n\nFirst, we find the probability of no employees being injured:\nP(0) = (1 - 0.025)^80\n\nNext, we find the probability of exactly one employee being injured:\nP(1) = C(80, 1) * (0.025)^1 * (1 - 0.025)^(80-1)\nwhere C(80, 1) is the number of combinations of choosing 1 employee out of 80, which is 80.\n\nNow, we find the complementary probability:\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\nP(0) ≈ 0.025^80 ≈ 0.3616\nP(1) ≈ 80 * 0.025 * 0.975^79 ≈ 0.3717\n\nFinally, we find the probability of at least two employees being injured:\nP(at least 2) = 1 - 0.3616 - 0.3717 ≈ 0.2667\n\nSo, the probability that at least two employees will be injured on a particular day is approximately 0.2667 or 26.67%."
