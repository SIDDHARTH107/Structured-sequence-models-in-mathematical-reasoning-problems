    "message_2": "To determine if the set of all smooth maps of the unit circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$ into the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed under the operation $\\circ$, we need to check if the composition of two smooth maps is also a smooth map. \n\nLet $f, g: \\mathbb{S}^1 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be smooth maps. We want to show that $(f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a smooth map. Since $f$ and $g$ are smooth, their derivatives exist and are continuous. The chain rule states that if $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions, then the derivative of the composition $(f \\circ g)(x)$ is given by:\n\n$(f \\circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n\nSince $f'$ and $g'$ are continuous, the product of these two continuous functions is also continuous. Thus, $(f \\circ g)(x)$ is differentiable, and its derivative is continuous, which means $(f \\circ g)(x)$ is a smooth map.\n\nNow, we need to check if the set of smooth maps of the unit circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$ into the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ forms a group under the operation $\\circ$. A group must satisfy the following four properties:\n\n1. Closure: We have already shown that the set is closed under the operation $\\circ$.\n2. Associativity: The composition of functions is associative, i.e., $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$ for all smooth maps $f, g, h: \\mathbb{S}^1 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n3. Identity: We need to find an identity element $e: \\mathbb{S}^1 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f \\circ e = e \\circ f = f$ for all smooth maps $f: \\mathbb{S}^1 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. However, this is not possible. The identity map $e(x) = x$ is not a valid element in the set of smooth maps from $\\mathbb{S}^1$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, as it maps from $\\mathbb{S}^1$ to $\\mathbb{S}^1$, not to $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, there is no identity element in the set of smooth maps from $\\mathbb{S}^1$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince the set of smooth maps from $\\mathbb{S}^1$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ does not have an identity element, it does not form a group under the operation $\\circ$."
