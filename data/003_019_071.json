    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of 4sin(x)cos(x) from x=0 to x=π/2, we first need to find the antiderivative of the function. We can use the double angle identity for sine, which is:\n\nsin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n\nSo, our function can be rewritten as:\n\n2 * 2sin(x)cos(x) = 2sin(2x)\n\nNow, we find the antiderivative of 2sin(2x):\n\n∫2sin(2x) dx = -cos(2x) + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from x=0 to x=π/2:\n\n[-cos(2(π/2)) + C] - [-cos(2(0)) + C] = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, the definite integral of 4sin(x)cos(x) from x=0 to x=π/2 is 1."
