    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, it touches all six faces of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nThe edge length of the cube is 4 cm, so the diameter of the sphere is also 4 cm. The radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is 4 cm / 2 = 2 cm.\n\nNow we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is V = (4/3)πr³, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nV = (4/3)π(2 cm)³\nV = (4/3)π(8 cm³)\nV = (32/3)π cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately (32/3)π cm³, or approximately 33.51 cm³."
