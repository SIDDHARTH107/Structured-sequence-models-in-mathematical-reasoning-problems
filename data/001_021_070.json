    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0, we can first try to find any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial P(x) = a_nx^n + a_(n-1)x^(n-1) + ... + a_1x + a_0 can be written in the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term a_0 and q is a factor of the leading coefficient a_n.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is -6 and the leading coefficient is 3. The factors of -6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6, and the factors of 3 are ±1 and ±3. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±1/3, and ±2/3.\n\nNow, we can test these possible rational roots by plugging them into the polynomial equation:\n\nP(1) = 3(1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 2(1) - 6 = -5 ≠ 0\nP(-1) = 3(-1)^3 - 4(-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 6 = -11 ≠ 0\nP(2) = 3(2)^3 - 4(2)^2 + 2(2) - 6 = 6 ≠ 0\nP(-2) = 3(-2)^3 - 4(-2)^2 + 2(-2) - 6 = -26 ≠ 0\nP(3) = 3(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 6 = 45 ≠ 0\nP(-3) = 3(-3)^3 - 4(-3)^2 + 2(-3) - 6 = -9 ≠ 0\nP(6) = 3(6)^3 - 4(6)^2 + 2(6) - 6 = 594 ≠ 0\nP(-6) = 3(-6)^3 - 4(-6)^2 + 2(-6) - 6 = -666 ≠ 0\nP(1/3) = 3(1/3)^3 - 4(1/3)^2 + 2(1/3) - 6 ≈ -5.37 ≠ 0\nP(-1/3) = 3(-1/3)^3 - 4(-1/3)^2 + 2(-1/3) - 6 ≈ -6.63 ≠ 0\nP(2/3) = 3(2/3)^3 - 4(2/3)^2 + 2(2/3) - 6 ≈ -3.56 ≠ 0\nP(-2/3) = 3(-2/3)^3 - 4(-2/3)^2 + 2(-2/3) - 6 ≈ -8.44 ≠ 0\n\nNone of the possible rational roots are actual roots of the polynomial equation. At this point, we can use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator, to approximate the real roots of the polynomial equation. However, finding an exact solution analytically is not possible in this case."
