    "message_1": "Suppose that we have a vector bundle $E$ over a space $X$, where $X$ is a compact 2-manifold. If $E$ is a rank-2 bundle with determinant line bundle $L$, and $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, what is the possible isomorphism class of $L$?",
    "message_2": "Since $X$ is a compact 2-manifold with $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, we know that $X$ is a non-orientable surface. The only compact, connected, non-orientable 2-manifold with $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ is the real projective plane $\\mathbb{RP}^2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the determinant line bundle $L = \\det(E)$. Since $E$ is a rank-2 vector bundle, $L$ is a line bundle, which is a rank-1 vector bundle. The isomorphism classes of line bundles on $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ are classified by the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(L) \\in H^1(\\mathbb{RP}^2; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$. \n\nThere are two possibilities for $w_1(L)$:\n\n1. $w_1(L) = 0$: In this case, $L$ is the trivial line bundle, i.e., $L \\cong \\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2. $w_1(L) \\neq 0$: In this case, $L$ is the nontrivial line bundle over $\\mathbb{RP}^2$. This is the so-called \"tautological\" or \"canonical\" line bundle, often denoted by $\\mathcal{O}(-1)$ or $\\gamma_1$.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these possibilities is realized by the determinant line bundle of a rank-2 vector bundle $E$ over $\\mathbb{RP}^2$. Recall that the first Stiefel-Whitney class of a vector bundle is additive, i.e., $w_1(E) = w_1(L) + w_1(L')$, where $L'$ is the other line bundle in the direct sum decomposition $E \\cong L \\oplus L'$.\n\nSince $E$ is a rank-2 vector bundle, $w_1(E) = 0$. Therefore, we must have $w_1(L) + w_1(L') = 0$. This implies that $L$ and $L'$ have the same first Stiefel-Whitney class, i.e., either both are trivial or both are nontrivial.\n\nIf both $L$ and $L'$ are trivial, then $E \\cong \\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$, which is a rank-2 vector bundle with a trivial determinant line bundle. However, if both $L$ and $L'$ are nontrivial, then $E \\cong \\gamma_1 \\oplus \\gamma_1$. In this case, the determinant line bundle is $L \\otimes L' \\cong \\gamma_1 \\otimes \\gamma_1$, which is the trivial line bundle since $\\gamma_1 \\otimes \\gamma_1 \\cong \\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the possible isomorphism class of the determinant line bundle $L$ is the trivial line bundle, i.e., $L \\cong \\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$."
