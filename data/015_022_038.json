    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = a * x(t-τ) / (1 + x(t-τ)^c) - b * x(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the variable of interest, a, b, and c are positive constants, and τ is the time delay. In this case, a=0.2, b=0.1, c=10, and τ=17.\n\nTo find the equilibrium point, we need to find the value of x(t) when dx(t)/dt = 0. In other words, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n0 = a * x(t-τ) / (1 + x(t-τ)^c) - b * x(t)\n\nLet x_eq be the equilibrium point. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = a * x_eq / (1 + x_eq^c) - b * x_eq\n\nNow, we can solve for x_eq:\n\nb * x_eq = a * x_eq / (1 + x_eq^c)\n\nx_eq * (b * (1 + x_eq^c) - a) = 0\n\nSince x_eq = 0 is a trivial solution, we focus on the non-trivial solution:\n\nb * (1 + x_eq^c) - a = 0\n\n1 + x_eq^c = a / b\n\nx_eq^c = (a / b) - 1\n\nx_eq = ((a / b) - 1)^(1/c)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nx_eq = ((0.2 / 0.1) - 1)^(1/10)\n\nx_eq = (1 - 1)^(1/10)\n\nx_eq = 0\n\nIn this case, the equilibrium point x_eq = 0. However, it is important to note that the Mackey-Glass equation can exhibit chaotic behavior for certain parameter values, and the equilibrium point might not be stable. In such cases, the system will not converge to the equilibrium point but will instead exhibit complex, unpredictable behavior."
