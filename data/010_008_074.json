    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nχ(Y) = V - E\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the complex Y.\n\nIn this case, Y has 4 vertices (1, 2, 4, and 6) and 3 edges (1-2, 2-4, and 4-6). Therefore, the Euler characteristic of Y is:\n\nχ(Y) = 4 - 3 = 1"
