    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and the length of the two bases are 6 cm and 10 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 = 6 cm, base2 = 10 cm, and the height = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (6 + 10) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (16) * 8\nArea = 8 * 8\nArea = 64 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 64 square centimeters."
