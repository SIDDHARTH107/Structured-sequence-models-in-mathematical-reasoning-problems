    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we first need to rewrite the inequalities as equations by introducing slack variables. Let $s_1, s_2, s_3,$ and $s_4$ be non-negative integers such that:\n\n$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + s_1 = 14$\n$x_1 + x_2 + x_4 + s_2 = 15$\n$x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + s_3 = 16$\n$x_3 + x_4 + x_1 + s_4 = 17$\n\nNow, we can use generating functions to count the number of integer solutions. The generating function for each equation is:\n\n$(1 + x + x^2 + ...)(1 + x + x^2 + ...)(1 + x + x^2 + ...)(1 + x + x^2 + ...)$\n\nThis is because each factor represents the possible values of each variable, and the exponent of $x$ in each term represents the value of the corresponding variable.\n\nThe generating function for the entire system of equations is the product of the generating functions for each equation:\n\n$G(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + ...)^{12}$\n\nWe want to find the coefficient of $x^{14}$ in $G(x)$, which represents the number of integer solutions to the system of equations. Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\n$G(x) = \\binom{12}{0} + \\binom{12}{1}x + \\binom{12}{2}x^2 + ... + \\binom{12}{14}x^{14} + ...$\n\nThe coefficient of $x^{14}$ in $G(x)$ is $\\binom{12}{14} = \\binom{12}{2} = 66$.\n\nTherefore, there are 66 integer solutions to the given system of equations."
