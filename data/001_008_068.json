    "message_2": "To find the integer solutions for the inequality 3x + 2y < 12, where x and y are non-negative integers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rearrange the inequality to make y the subject:\n2y < 12 - 3x\ny < (12 - 3x)/2\n\n2. Since x and y are non-negative integers, we can start by plugging in x = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, and find the corresponding values of y that satisfy the inequality.\n\n- For x = 0:\ny < (12 - 3*0)/2\ny < 12/2\ny < 6\nThe possible values for y are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n- For x = 1:\ny < (12 - 3*1)/2\ny < 9/2\ny < 4.5\nThe possible values for y are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n- For x = 2:\ny < (12 - 3*2)/2\ny < 6/2\ny < 3\nThe possible values for y are 0, 1, and 2.\n\n- For x = 3:\ny < (12 - 3*3)/2\ny < 3/2\ny < 1.5\nThe possible values for y are 0 and 1.\n\n- For x = 4:\ny < (12 - 3*4)/2\ny < 0/2\ny < 0\nSince y must be a non-negative integer, there are no possible values for y when x = 4.\n\n3. Combine the possible values of x and y to form ordered pairs:\n(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), and (3, 1).\n\nThese are the ordered pairs (x, y) that satisfy the inequality 3x + 2y < 12, where x and y are non-negative integers."
