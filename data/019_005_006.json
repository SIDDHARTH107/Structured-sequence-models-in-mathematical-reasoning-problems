    "message_1": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a specific numerical problem for Epistemic logic, as it deals with reasoning about knowledge and belief rather than mathematical calculations. However, I can provide a question that involves applying the concepts of Epistemic logic:\n\nSuppose there are two math students, Alice and Bob, who have each been told that one of them has been given a prize for solving a difficult problem. Alice says, \"I don't know whether I have the prize,\" and Bob responds, \"I don't know whether I have the prize either.\" Using the rules of Epistemic logic, can you determine who actually has the prize?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation using Epistemic logic.\n\n1. Alice says, \"I don't know whether I have the prize.\" This means that there are two possibilities: either Alice has the prize, or Bob has the prize. If Alice had known that she didn't have the prize, then she would know that Bob has the prize.\n\n2. Bob hears Alice's statement and responds, \"I don't know whether I have the prize either.\" Now, if Bob knew that he didn't have the prize, then he would know that Alice has the prize, because there are only two of them. But Bob says he doesn't know, which means that he also doesn't know that he doesn't have the prize.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can't determine who actually has the prize. Both Alice and Bob are uncertain about who has the prize, and their statements don't provide enough information to deduce the winner."
