    "message_2": "The area of the main cardioid within the Mandelbrot set can be calculated using the formula for the area of a cardioid:\n\nArea = 1/2 * π * a^2\n\nIn the case of the Mandelbrot set, the main cardioid has a parameter 'a' equal to 1/4. Therefore, the area of the main cardioid is:\n\nArea = 1/2 * π * (1/4)^2\nArea = 1/2 * π * 1/16\nArea = π/32\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid within the Mandelbrot set is π/32 or approximately 0.09817477042."
