Using principal component analysis, determine the percentage of total variance explained by the first two principal components. \n\nAssume the following are the variances for the first four principal components of the data set: \n\n- Principal component 1 variance = 105.23\n- Principal component 2 variance = 56.78\n- Principal component 3 variance = 20.56\n- Principal component 4 variance = 12.90",
    "message_2": "To determine the percentage of total variance explained by the first two principal components, we first need to calculate the total variance of all four principal components. Then, we will calculate the combined variance of the first two principal components. Finally, we will find the percentage of the total variance explained by the first two principal components.\n\n1. Calculate the total variance of all four principal components:\n\nTotal variance = Principal component 1 variance + Principal component 2 variance + Principal component 3 variance + Principal component 4 variance\n\nTotal variance = 105.23 + 56.78 + 20.56 + 12.90\nTotal variance = 195.47\n\n2. Calculate the combined variance of the first two principal components:\n\nCombined variance of first two components = Principal component 1 variance + Principal component 2 variance\nCombined variance of first two components = 105.23 + 56.78\nCombined variance of first two components = 162.01\n\n3. Calculate the percentage of total variance explained by the first two principal components:\n\nPercentage of total variance explained = (Combined variance of first two components / Total variance) * 100\n\nPercentage of total variance explained = (162.01 / 195.47) * 100\nPercentage of total variance explained â‰ˆ 82.88%\n\nSo, the first two principal components explain approximately 82.88% of the total variance in the data set."
