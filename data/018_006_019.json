The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets.\n\nA ∪ ∁A = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the union of A and ∁A is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ ∁A = U\n\nThus, we have shown that the union of A and its complement ∁A equals the universal set U."
