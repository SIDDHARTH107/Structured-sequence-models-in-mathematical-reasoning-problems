    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x - 3 < 5x + 4, we first need to isolate x. We can do this by following these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2x from both sides of the inequality:\n-3 < 3x + 4\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 from both sides of the inequality:\n-7 < 3x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 3:\n-7/3 < x\n\nNow we have the inequality in the form -7/3 < x, which means x is greater than -7/3.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line with -7/3 marked on it.\n2. Since x is greater than -7/3, we want to shade the region to the right of -7/3.\n3. Place an open circle at -7/3 to indicate that x is not equal to -7/3, but only greater than it.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n<---(---(-7/3)---)--->\n       (open circle)\n\nThe open circle at -7/3 indicates that x is greater than -7/3, and the shaded region to the right of -7/3 represents all the possible values of x that satisfy the inequality."
