At t = π/6, the particle moves with velocity vector v(π/6) = (-√3, 2) and the curve has constant curvature. Determine the parallel transport of the velocity vector along the curve up to t = π/2.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the velocity vector along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) and the normal vector N(t) of the curve at each point. Since the curve has constant curvature, the angle between the velocity vector and the tangent vector will remain constant as the particle moves along the curve.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector T(t) by differentiating x(t) and y(t) with respect to t:\n\ndx/dt = -3 sin(t)\ndy/dt = 4 cos(t)\n\nSo, T(t) = (-3 sin(t), 4 cos(t)).\n\nNow, let's find the normal vector N(t) by differentiating T(t) with respect to t:\n\nd(-3 sin(t))/dt = -3 cos(t)\nd(4 cos(t))/dt = -4 sin(t)\n\nSo, N(t) = (-3 cos(t), -4 sin(t)).\n\nAt t = π/6, we have:\n\nT(π/6) = (-3 sin(π/6), 4 cos(π/6)) = (-3/2, 2√3)\nN(π/6) = (-3 cos(π/6), -4 sin(π/6)) = (-3√3/2, -2)\n\nThe velocity vector at t = π/6 is v(π/6) = (-√3, 2). Let's find the angle θ between the velocity vector and the tangent vector at t = π/6:\n\ncos(θ) = (v(π/6) • T(π/6)) / (||v(π/6)|| ||T(π/6)||)\n\ncos(θ) = ((-√3)(-3/2) + (2)(2√3)) / (2√3 * 3)\ncos(θ) = (3√3/2 + 4√3) / (6√3)\ncos(θ) = (7√3/2) / (6√3)\ncos(θ) = 7/12\n\nNow, we want to find the parallel transport of the velocity vector at t = π/2. We know that the angle θ between the velocity vector and the tangent vector will remain constant. So, we can find the tangent vector and normal vector at t = π/2:\n\nT(π/2) = (-3 sin(π/2), 4 cos(π/2)) = (-3, 0)\nN(π/2) = (-3 cos(π/2), -4 sin(π/2)) = (0, -4)\n\nLet the parallel transport of the velocity vector at t = π/2 be v'(π/2) = (a, b). We can write v'(π/2) as a linear combination of T(π/2) and N(π/2):\n\nv'(π/2) = aT(π/2) + bN(π/2) = (-3a, -4b)\n\nSince the angle θ between v'(π/2) and T(π/2) is constant, we have:\n\ncos(θ) = (v'(π/2) • T(π/2)) / (||v'(π/2)|| ||T(π/2)||)\n\n7/12 = ((-3a)(-3) + (0)(-4b)) / (sqrt((-3a)^2 + (-4b)^2) * 3)\n\n7/12 = (9a) / (3√(9a^2 + 16b^2))\n\n7/12 = 3a / √(9a^2 + 16b^2)\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\n49/144 = 9a^2 / (9a^2 + 16b^2)\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n49(9a^2 + 16b^2) = 144 * 9a^2\n\n49 * 9a^2 + 49 * 16b^2 = 144 * 9a^2\n\n49 * 16b^2 = 95 * 9a^2\n\n784b^2 = 855a^2\n\nb^2 = (855/784)a^2\n\nNow, we know that ||v'(π/2)|| = 2√3 (since the magnitude of the velocity vector remains constant):\n\n(-3a)^2 + (-4b)^2 = (2√3)^2\n\n9a^2 + 16b^2 = 12\n\nSubstitute b^2 = (855/784)a^2:\n\n9a^2 + 16(855/784)a^2 = 12\n\n(9 + 16(855/784))a^2 = 12\n\n(9(784/784) + 16(855/784))a^2 = 12\n\n(7056/784)a^2 = 12\n\na^2 = 12 * (784/7056)\n\na^2 = 112/753\n\na = √(112/753)\n\nNow, substitute a back into the equation for b^2:\n\nb^2 = (855/784)(112/753)\n\nb^2 = 95/112\n\nb = √(95/112)\n\nFinally, we can find the parallel transport of the velocity vector at t = π/2:\n\nv'(π/2) = (-3a, -4b) = (-3√(112/753), -4√(95/112))\n\nv'(π/2) ≈ (-1.95, -1.83)"
