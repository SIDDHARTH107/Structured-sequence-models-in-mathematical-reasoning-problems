    "message_1": "One example of a numerical problem related to non-monotonic logic is:\n\nConsider the following premises:\n\n1. If John is happy, he will dance.\n2. John is not dancing.\n\nFrom these premises, can we deduce that John is not happy? Use non-monotonic logic to provide your answer.",
    "message_2": "In non-monotonic logic, we can make inferences based on the information we have, but these inferences can be revised if new information is added. In this case, we have the following premises:\n\n1. If John is happy, he will dance.\n2. John is not dancing.\n\nUsing non-monotonic logic, we can make the following inference:\n\n3. John is not happy.\n\nThis inference is based on the information we have, which suggests that if John were happy, he would be dancing. Since he is not dancing, we can infer that he is not happy. However, this conclusion is not definitive, as new information could be added that might change our inference. For example, if we learn that John is injured and cannot dance, then our inference that he is not happy may no longer be valid. In this case, we would need to revise our conclusion based on the new information.\n\nSo, using non-monotonic logic, we can tentatively deduce that John is not happy, but this conclusion is subject to revision if new information becomes available."
