What is the shortest possible path he can take to visit all the six cities exactly once and finish at his starting point? The distances (in miles) between the cities are as follows: \n\nA to B: 10 miles,\nA to C: 20 miles,\nA to D: 15 miles,\nB to C: 25 miles,\nB to D: 30 miles,\nB to E: 35 miles,\nC to D: 12 miles,\nC to E: 28 miles,\nC to F: 22 miles,\nD to E: 18 miles,\nD to F: 20 miles,\nE to F: 25 miles. \n\nWhat is the total distance of this shortest path and the order in which he should visit the cities to minimize the total distance traveled?",
