    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that grows in length with each iteration. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Original Length * (2^(Iteration/2))\n\nIn this case, the original length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 10th iteration. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\nLength = 1 * 32\nLength = 32 units\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon curve after the 10th iteration is 32 units."
