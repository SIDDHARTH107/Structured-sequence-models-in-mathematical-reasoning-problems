    "message_2": "In a planar graph, the number of edges (E), vertices (V), and faces (F) are related by Euler's formula:\n\nE - V + F = 2\n\nFor a planar graph, the number of faces (F) can be at most 3V - 6, since each face is formed by at least 3 edges.\n\nUsing this inequality, we can find the maximum number of edges in a planar graph with 8 vertices:\n\nE - 8 + F = 2\nE - 8 + (3 * 8 - 6) = 2\nE - 8 + 18 = 2\nE = 12\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges in a planar graph with 8 vertices is 12."
