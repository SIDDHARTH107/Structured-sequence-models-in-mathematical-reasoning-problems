    "message_2": "To find the probability of randomly selecting 3 employees and none of them being involved in financial fraud, we can use the formula for combinations.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of selecting an employee who is not involved in financial fraud. Since 10% of the employees are involved in financial fraud, that means 90% of them are not involved in financial fraud. So the probability of selecting an employee not involved in financial fraud is 0.9.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of this happening 3 times in a row (since we are selecting 3 employees). We can do this by multiplying the probabilities together:\n\nProbability = (0.9) * (0.9) * (0.9) = 0.9^3 = 0.729\n\nSo the probability of randomly selecting 3 employees and none of them being involved in financial fraud is 0.729 or 72.9%."
