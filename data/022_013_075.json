    "message_2": "To find the complex number z such that f(z) = 5 + 4i, we can set up the equation:\n\nf(z) = 3z + 2i = 5 + 4i\n\nNow, we need to solve for z. We can start by subtracting 2i from both sides:\n\n3z = 5 + 4i - 2i\n3z = 5 + 2i\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\nz = (5 + 2i) / 3\n\nTo make it more clear, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nz = 5/3 + (2/3)i\n\nSo, the complex number z that satisfies the given condition is z = 5/3 + (2/3)i."
