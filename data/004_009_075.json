    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * e^x using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together: u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = e^x.\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these functions: u'(x) = 2x and v'(x) = e^x.\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is given by:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(e^x) + (x^2)(e^x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = (2(2))(e^2) + (2^2)(e^2)\nf'(2) = 4e^2 + 4e^2\nf'(2) = 8e^2\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * e^x at x = 2 is 8e^2."
