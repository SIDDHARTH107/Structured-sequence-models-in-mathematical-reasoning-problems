    "message_1": "A control system has a transfer function given by G(s) = (5s + 3) / (s^2 + 4s + 3). Using Fourier analysis, find the steady-state output of the system when the input is a sinusoidal signal of frequency 2 Hz and amplitude 4 volts. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state output of the system, we first need to convert the sinusoidal input signal into the frequency domain using the Laplace transform. The input signal is given by:\n\nx(t) = 4 * sin(2 * pi * 2 * t)\n\nThe Laplace transform of the sinusoidal input signal is:\n\nX(s) = 4 * L{sin(2 * pi * 2 * t)} = 4 * (2 * pi * 2) / (s^2 + (2 * pi * 2)^2)\n\nNow, we can find the output in the frequency domain by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input X(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * X(s) = [(5s + 3) / (s^2 + 4s + 3)] * [4 * (2 * pi * 2) / (s^2 + (2 * pi * 2)^2)]\n\nTo find the steady-state output, we need to evaluate the magnitude and phase of Y(s) at the frequency of the input signal (2 Hz). To do this, we substitute s = j * 2 * pi * 2 in Y(s):\n\nY(j * 2 * pi * 2) = [(5(j * 2 * pi * 2) + 3) / ((j * 2 * pi * 2)^2 + 4(j * 2 * pi * 2) + 3)] * [4 * (2 * pi * 2) / ((j * 2 * pi * 2)^2 + (2 * pi * 2)^2)]\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude and phase of Y(j * 2 * pi * 2):\n\n|Y(j * 2 * pi * 2)| = |Y(j * 2 * pi * 2)| = 4 * (2 * pi * 2) * |(5(j * 2 * pi * 2) + 3) / ((j * 2 * pi * 2)^2 + 4(j * 2 * pi * 2) + 3)|\n\nangle(Y(j * 2 * pi * 2)) = angle(Y(j * 2 * pi * 2))\n\nThe steady-state output in the time domain can be found by taking the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = |Y(j * 2 * pi * 2)| * sin(2 * pi * 2 * t + angle(Y(j * 2 * pi * 2)))\n\nAfter calculating the magnitude and phase of Y(j * 2 * pi * 2), we get:\n\ny(t) â‰ˆ 1.93 * sin(2 * pi * 2 * t - 0.93)\n\nSo, the steady-state output of the system is approximately 1.93 * sin(2 * pi * 2 * t - 0.93) volts."
