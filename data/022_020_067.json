    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using complex analysis techniques, we first rewrite the given differential equation as a homogeneous equation and then find its complementary function. Next, we find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation and finally apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants.\n\n1. Rewrite the given equation as a homogeneous equation:\n\n(𝑥^2 − 4)𝑢″(𝑥) − 2𝑥𝑢′(𝑥) + 2𝑢(𝑥) = 0\n\n2. Find the complementary function:\n\nLet's assume a solution of the form u(x) = x^r. Then, u'(x) = r * x^(r-1) and u''(x) = r * (r-1) * x^(r-2).\n\nSubstitute these into the homogeneous equation:\n\n(x^2 - 4) * r * (r-1) * x^(r-2) - 2x * r * x^(r-1) + 2 * x^r = 0\n\nDivide by x^(r-2):\n\n(r * (r-1) * (x^2 - 4) - 2r * x^2 + 2 * x^2) = 0\n\nThis is an indicial equation. Solving for r, we get r = 1 and r = 2.\n\nSo, the complementary function is:\n\nu_c(x) = A * x + B * x^2\n\n3. Find a particular solution:\n\nTo find a particular solution, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. Assume a solution of the form u_p(x) = C * x^2. Then, u_p'(x) = 2 * C * x and u_p''(x) = 2 * C.\n\nSubstitute these into the non-homogeneous equation:\n\n(x^2 - 4) * 2 * C - 2 * x * 2 * C * x + 2 * C * x^2 = x^2\n\nSimplify and solve for C:\n\n2C * (x^2 - 4 - 2x^2 + x^2) = x^2\n2C * (-x^2 - 4) = x^2\n\nC = -x^2 / (2 * (-x^2 - 4)) = 1/2\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nu_p(x) = (1/2) * x^2\n\n4. The general solution is the sum of the complementary function and the particular solution:\n\nu(x) = A * x + B * x^2 + (1/2) * x^2\n\n5. Apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(-2) = A * (-2) + B * (-2)^2 + (1/2) * (-2)^2 = 1\nu(2) = A * 2 + B * 2^2 + (1/2) * 2^2 = 2\n\nSolve these equations for A and B:\n\n-2A + 4B + 4 = 1\n2A + 4B + 4 = 2\n\nA = -1/4, B = 1/4\n\n6. The final solution is:\n\nu(x) = (-1/4) * x + (1/4) * x^2 + (1/2) * x^2\n\nu(x) = (-1/4) * x + (3/4) * x^2"
