    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products AxB and BxA:\n\nAxB = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\nBxA = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the unions (AxB) U (BxA) and (BxA) U (AxB):\n\n(AxB) U (BxA) = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\n(BxA) U (AxB) = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nAs we can see, the sets (AxB) U (BxA) and (BxA) U (AxB) contain the same elements, so they are equal. However, this does not contradict the fact that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union. The Cartesian product itself is not commutative, meaning that AxB is not equal to BxA. The union operation is commutative, so (AxB) U (BxA) is equal to (BxA) U (AxB), but this does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative."
