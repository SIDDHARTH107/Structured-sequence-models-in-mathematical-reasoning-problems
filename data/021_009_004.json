    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient or slope of the function at any point x.\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 3x + 5\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 3\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the minimum value of the function. We start with an initial guess of x = 0 and a learning rate of 0.1. We will perform 5 iterations.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - learning_rate * f'(x0)\nx1 = 0 - 0.1 * (2*0 - 3)\nx1 = 0 + 0.3\nx1 = 0.3\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - learning_rate * f'(x1)\nx2 = 0.3 - 0.1 * (2*0.3 - 3)\nx2 = 0.3 + 0.24\nx2 = 0.54\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - learning_rate * f'(x2)\nx3 = 0.54 - 0.1 * (2*0.54 - 3)\nx3 = 0.54 + 0.192\nx3 = 0.732\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = x3 - learning_rate * f'(x3)\nx4 = 0.732 - 0.1 * (2*0.732 - 3)\nx4 = 0.732 + 0.1536\nx4 = 0.8856\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = x4 - learning_rate * f'(x4)\nx5 = 0.8856 - 0.1 * (2*0.8856 - 3)\nx5 = 0.8856 + 0.12288\nx5 = 1.00848\n\nAfter 5 iterations, we have x ≈ 1.00848. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function f(x) at this point:\n\nf(1.00848) = (1.00848)^2 - 3(1.00848) + 5\nf(1.00848) ≈ 1.01697 - 3.02544 + 5\nf(1.00848) ≈ 2.99153\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 5 using the gradient descent method is approximately 2.99153."
