    "message_1": "Suppose a basketball player has a free throw shooting percentage of 80%. If the player shoots 10 free throws in a row, what is the probability that they make at least 8 of the shots using a Monte Carlo simulation?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of making at least 8 shots out of 10 using a Monte Carlo simulation, we will perform a large number of trials and count the number of successful trials (where the player makes at least 8 shots). Then, we will divide the number of successful trials by the total number of trials to get the probability.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef shoot_free_throw(probability):\n    return random.random() < probability\n\ndef simulate_free_throws(num_shots, probability):\n    successful_shots = 0\n    for _ in range(num_shots):\n        if shoot_free_throw(probability):\n            successful_shots += 1\n    return successful_shots\n\ndef monte_carlo_simulation(num_trials, num_shots, probability, target_shots):\n    successful_trials = 0\n    for _ in range(num_trials):\n        if simulate_free_throws(num_shots, probability) >= target_shots:\n            successful_trials += 1\n    return successful_trials / num_trials\n\nnum_trials = 100000\nnum_shots = 10\nprobability = 0.8\ntarget_shots = 8\n\nestimated_probability = monte_carlo_simulation(num_trials, num_shots, probability, target_shots)\nprint(\"Estimated probability of making at least 8 shots out of 10:\", estimated_probability)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you an estimated probability of making at least 8 shots out of 10 using a Monte Carlo simulation. The result should be close to the actual probability, which can be calculated using the binomial probability formula. Note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the simulation due to the random nature of the Monte Carlo method."
