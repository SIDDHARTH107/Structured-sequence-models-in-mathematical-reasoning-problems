    "message_1": "A math teacher wants to test whether a new method of teaching improves student performance in a subject. They randomly divide 30 students into two groups: Group A and Group B. Group A receives the traditional style of teaching while Group B receives the new method of teaching. At the end of the term, they compare the mean scores of both groups. Group A has a mean score of 75 with a standard deviation of 7 while Group B has a mean score of 80 with a standard deviation of 5. Is there evidence to support that the new method of teaching is more effective? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is evidence to support that the new method of teaching is more effective, we will perform a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the mean scores between the two groups, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the mean score of Group B is greater than the mean score of Group A.\n\nGiven data:\nn1 = n2 = 15 (since there are 30 students divided equally into two groups)\nMean1 (µ1) = 75\nStandard deviation1 (σ1) = 7\nMean2 (µ2) = 80\nStandard deviation2 (σ2) = 5\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the difference in means:\nSE = √[(σ1^2/n1) + (σ2^2/n2)] = √[(7^2/15) + (5^2/15)] = √[(49/15) + (25/15)] = √[74/15] ≈ 2.21\n\nNext, we calculate the t-score:\nt = (µ2 - µ1) / SE = (80 - 75) / 2.21 ≈ 2.26\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n1 + n2 - 2 = 15 + 15 - 2 = 28. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately 1.701.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (2.26) is greater than the critical t-value (1.701), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. There is evidence to support that the new method of teaching is more effective at a significance level of 0.05."
