    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of the hyperbolic surface formed by gluing together two regular octagons along their edges, we can use the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic (χ) = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nWhen we glue the two octagons together, we get the following:\n\n1. Vertices (V): Each octagon has 8 vertices, but since we are gluing them together along their edges, each pair of vertices becomes a single vertex. So, we have 8 vertices in total.\n\n2. Edges (E): Each octagon has 8 edges, and since we are gluing them together along their edges, we still have 8 edges in total.\n\n3. Faces (F): We have two octagons, but since they are glued together, they form a single surface. So, we have 1 face.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\nχ = 8 - 8 + 1\nχ = 1\n\nThe Euler characteristic of the hyperbolic surface formed by gluing together two regular octagons along their edges in a way that preserves symmetry is 1."
