    "message_2": "First, we will eliminate z from the first and second equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 1, so that the coefficients of z in both equations are equal.\n\nFirst equation * 4:\n12x + 8y - 4z = 28\n\nSecond equation * 1:\n2x - y + 4z = 4\n\nNow, we will add the two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(12x + 8y - 4z) + (2x - y + 4z) = 28 + 4\n14x + 7y = 32\n\nNow, we have a new equation with only x and y variables:\n14x + 7y = 32\n\nNext, we will eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 1 and the third equation by -1, so that the coefficients of z in both equations are equal.\n\nFirst equation * 1:\n3x + 2y - z = 7\n\nThird equation * -1:\n-5x - z = -10\n\nNow, we will add the two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(3x + 2y - z) + (-5x - z) = 7 + (-10)\n-2x + 2y = -3\n\nNow, we have another new equation with only x and y variables:\n-2x + 2y = -3\n\nWe will now solve the system of two linear equations with two variables (x and y):\n\n14x + 7y = 32\n-2x + 2y = -3\n\nTo eliminate y, we will multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 7/2:\n\nFirst equation * 1:\n14x + 7y = 32\n\nSecond equation * 7/2:\n-7x + 7y = -21/2\n\nNow, we will add the two equations to eliminate y:\n\n(14x + 7y) + (-7x + 7y) = 32 + (-21/2)\n7x = 43/2\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\nx = (43/2) / 7\nx = 43/14\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with only x and y variables to find the value of y. We will use the equation -2x + 2y = -3:\n\n-2(43/14) + 2y = -3\n\nMultiply both sides by 14 to eliminate the fraction:\n-86 + 28y = -42\n\nNow, solve for y:\n28y = 44\ny = 44/28\ny = 11/7\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the value of z. We will use the first equation 3x + 2y - z = 7:\n\n3(43/14) + 2(11/7) - z = 7\n\nMultiply both sides by 14 to eliminate the fractions:\n9(43) + 4(22) - 14z = 98\n\nNow, solve for z:\n387 + 88 - 14z = 98\n14z = 377\nz = 377/14\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = 43/14\ny = 11/7\nz = 377/14"
