    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible permutations of the cities and calculating the total distance for each permutation. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible permutations. However, since the salesman has to come back to the starting point, we can fix the starting point as city A and consider the permutations of the remaining 4 cities, which is 4! or 24 permutations.\n\nHere are the 24 permutations and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A: 2+5+6+3+4 = 20\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A: 2+5+5+3+1 = 16\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A: 2+2+6+5+4 = 19\n4. A-B-D-E-C-A: 2+2+3+5+3 = 15\n5. A-B-E-C-D-A: 2+1+5+6+1 = 15\n6. A-B-E-D-C-A: 2+1+3+6+3 = 15\n\n7.
