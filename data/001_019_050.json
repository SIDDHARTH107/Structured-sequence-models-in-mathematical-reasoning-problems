    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation $|2x+4|=12$, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero, i.e., $2x+4 \\ge 0$. In this case, we can remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n\n$2x+4=12$\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n$2x=8$\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n$x=4$\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative, i.e., $2x+4 < 0$. In this case, we can remove the absolute value sign and change the sign of the expression:\n\n$-(2x+4)=12$\n\nDistribute the negative sign:\n\n$-2x-4=12$\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\n$-2x=16$\n\nDivide by -2:\n\n$x=-8$\n\nSo, the solutions to the absolute value equation $|2x+4|=12$ are $x=4$ and $x=-8$."
