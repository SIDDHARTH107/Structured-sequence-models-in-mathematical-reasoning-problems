    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation. Also, multiply the first equation by -3 and add it to the third equation.\n\n2*(2x + y + z) = 2*8\n4x + 2y + 2z = 16\n\nNow subtract the first modified equation from the second equation:\n(4x - 6y + 2z) - (4x + 2y + 2z) = -6 - 16\n-8y = -22\ny = 22/8 = 11/4\n\nNow add -3 times the first equation to the third equation:\n-3*(2x + y + z) = -3*8\n-6x - 3y - 3z = -24\n\n(3x + 2y - z) - (-6x - 3y - 3z) = 1 - (-24)\n9x + 5y = 25\n\nNow substitute the value of y we found earlier into the new equation:\n9x + 5(11/4) = 25\n9x + 55/4 = 25\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:\n36x + 55 = 100\n\nNow solve for x:\n36x = 45\nx = 45/36 = 5/4\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can find the value of z by substituting them into the first equation:\n2(5/4) + 11/4 + z = 8\n5/2 + 11/4 = 8 - z\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fractions:\n10 + 11 = 32 - 4z\n21 = 32 - 4z\n\nNow solve for z:\n4z = 11\nz = 11/4\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 5/4, y = 11/4, and z = 11/4."
