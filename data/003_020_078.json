    "message_1": "A boat leaves dock A and travels 5 miles due east to dock B. The boat then changes direction and travels 7 miles due north to dock C. Calculate the distance between dock A and dock C using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem since it forms a right-angled triangle with docks A, B, and C as the vertices. Let AC be the distance between dock A and dock C.\n\nAB = 5 miles (due east)\nBC = 7 miles (due north)\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (AC) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (AB and BC).\n\nAC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\nAC^2 = (5 miles)^2 + (7 miles)^2\nAC^2 = 25 + 49\nAC^2 = 74\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of AC:\n\nAC = √74\nAC ≈ 8.60 miles\n\nSo, the distance between dock A and dock C is approximately 8.60 miles."
