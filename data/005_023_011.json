    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve on the subject of outlier detection:\n\nIn a dataset of student test scores, the mean score is 75 with a standard deviation of 5. If a score of 90 is considered an outlier, how many outliers are there in a dataset of 50 student test scores?",
    "message_2": "To determine if a score is an outlier, we can use the z-score formula, which is:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\n\nwhere x is the data point (in this case, the test score), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the z-score for the given test score of 90:\n\nz = (90 - 75) / 5\nz = 15 / 5\nz = 3\n\nA z-score of 3 means that the test score of 90 is 3 standard deviations away from the mean. Generally, a z-score greater than 2 or less than -2 is considered an outlier.\n\nSince a score of 90 is considered an outlier, we can assume that any score with a z-score greater than or equal to 3 is also an outlier. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of outliers in the dataset of 50 student test scores. We would need the actual test scores of all 50 students to calculate the z-scores and identify the number of outliers."
