    "message_2": "To determine the genus of Kruskal's graph with 7 vertices and 14 edges, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, Kruskal's graph with 7 vertices and 14 edges is not a planar graph, so we need to find the genus, which is the minimum number of handles that need to be added to a sphere to embed the graph without any edge crossings.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of edges (E_max) that a planar graph with 7 vertices can have using the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices.\n\nE_max ≤ 3(7) - 6\nE_max ≤ 21 - 6\nE_max ≤ 15\n\nSince Kruskal's graph has 14 edges, which is less than or equal to the maximum number of edges for a planar graph with 7 vertices, it might be planar. However, we need to check if it contains any forbidden subgraphs, such as the complete graph K_5 or the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}.\n\nKruskal's graph with 7 vertices and 14 edges is a complete graph K_7, which contains K_5 as a subgraph. Therefore, it is not planar.\n\nNow, let's find the genus using the Heawood's formula:\n\ng ≥ (7E - 21V + 36)/12\n\nwhere g is the genus, E is the number of edges, and V is the number of vertices.\n\ng ≥ (7(14) - 21(7) + 36)/12\ng ≥ (98 - 147 + 36)/12\ng ≥ (-13)/12\n\nSince the genus must be a non-negative integer, the minimum genus for Kruskal's graph with 7 vertices and 14 edges is 1."
