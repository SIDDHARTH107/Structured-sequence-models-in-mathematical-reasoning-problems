    "message_2": "To choose 3 letters from the word \"MATHS\", which has 5 distinct letters, you can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 5) and k is the number of items you want to choose (in this case, 3).\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n= 5! / (3!2!)\n= (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n= (5 × 4) / (2 × 1)\n= 10\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose 3 letters from the word \"MATHS\"."
