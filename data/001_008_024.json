    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the inequality 3x - 4 > 5x + 2, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality:\n-4 > 2x + 2\n\n2. Subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality:\n-6 > 2x\n\n3. Divide both sides by 2:\n-3 > x\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x < -3. All values of x less than -3 will satisfy the inequality 3x - 4 > 5x + 2."
