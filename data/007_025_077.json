    "message_1": "Bob and Alice are using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to securely communicate over an insecure channel. Bob chooses a prime number \"p\" as 17 and a primitive root \"g\" as 3. Alice chooses a private key \"a\" as 7 and Bob chooses a private key \"b\" as 11. What is the secret key that they both get after exchanging their public keys?",
    "message_2": "First, Alice and Bob compute their public keys:\n\nAlice's public key (A) = g^a mod p = 3^7 mod 17 = 15\nBob's public key (B) = g^b mod p = 3^11 mod 17 = 6\n\nNext, they exchange their public keys and compute the shared secret key:\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key: K_A = B^a mod p = 6^7 mod 17 = 4\nBob computes the shared secret key: K_B = A^b mod p = 15^11 mod 17 = 4\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have the same shared secret key, which is 4."
