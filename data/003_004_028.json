    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + √3 = 0 for x, where x belongs to [-π, π], we first isolate sin(x):\n\n2sin(x) = -√3\nsin(x) = -√3/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the given interval that satisfy this equation. Since sin(x) = -√3/2, we are looking for the angles in the interval [-π, π] where the sine function has a value of -√3/2. \n\nRecall that sine function has a value of √3/2 or -√3/2 at angles that are multiples of π/3 or 2π/3. In this case, we are interested in the angles where the sine function is negative. The sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants. \n\nIn the third quadrant, the angle that has a sine value of -√3/2 is:\n\nx = π + π/3 = 4π/3\n\nIn the fourth quadrant, the angle that has a sine value of -√3/2 is:\n\nx = 2π - π/3 = 5π/3\n\nHowever, 5π/3 is not in the interval [-π, π]. To find the equivalent angle in the given interval, we can subtract 2π:\n\nx = 5π/3 - 2π = 5π/3 - 6π/3 = -π/3\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 2sin(x) + √3 = 0 in the interval [-π, π] are:\n\nx = 4π/3 and x = -π/3"
