    "message_1": "Here is a Traveler's Dilemma problem for a math student to solve:\n \nTwo travelers are detained at an airport for carrying identical-looking bags. Their bags contain antique vases and both travelers are informed that the airport authorities will auction the vases and divide the proceeds equally among them. The auction will be conducted by a bidding process where the highest bidder will win the vase but pay the second-highest bid amount instead of their own bid.\n \nThe bids must be in multiples of $5 and can range from $5 to $100. Each traveler writes down their bid on a piece of paper without seeing the other's bid. If one traveler bids higher than the other, then they will win the auction and the vase, but if they both bid the same amount, then the auctioneer will toss a coin to decide who wins the vase.\n \nAssuming both travelers are rational and want to maximize their profit, what should be the bid of each traveler?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. Suppose one traveler bids X and the other bids Y, where X > Y. Then the traveler who bid X will win the vase and pay Y dollars. The profit for the winner will be X - Y. Since both travelers are rational and want to maximize their profit, they will try to minimize the difference between their bids.\n\nLet's consider the highest possible bid, which is $100. If one traveler bids $100, the other traveler can bid $95, and the first traveler will win the vase but pay only $95. This means that bidding $100 is not optimal, as the first traveler could have bid $95 and achieved the same result.\n\nNow let's consider the case where both travelers bid $95. If one traveler bids $95, the other traveler can bid $90, and the first traveler will win the vase but pay only $90. This means that bidding $95 is also not optimal, as the first traveler could have bid $90 and achieved the same result.\n\nWe can continue this process, and we'll find that each time we lower the bid by $5, the other traveler can lower their bid by another $5 and still achieve the same result. This continues until we reach the lowest possible bid, which is $5.\n\nSo, the optimal bid for both travelers is $5. If both travelers bid $5, then the auctioneer will toss a coin to decide who wins the vase, and the winner will pay $5. This is the best possible outcome for both travelers, as they have minimized the difference between their bids and maximized their profit."
