    "message_2": "First, let's recall some facts about groups and their centers:\n\n1. The center of a group, denoted Z(G), is the set of all elements that commute with every element in the group. Formally, Z(G) = {g ∈ G | gx = xg for all x ∈ G}.\n2. The center of a group is always a normal subgroup of the group.\n3. If G is a finite p-group (a group of order p^n for some prime p and integer n), then the center of G is nontrivial (i.e., it contains more than just the identity element).\n\nNow, let's consider the given group G of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, G is a 3-group. By fact 3, the center of G, Z(G), is nontrivial. We are given two cases to consider: when the center has order 3 and when the center is trivial.\n\nCase 1: The center of G has order 3.\n\nSince Z(G) is a normal subgroup of G, we can consider the quotient group G/Z(G). The order of G/Z(G) is |G|/|Z(G)| = 27/3 = 9. Since 9 = 3^2, G/Z(G) is a 3-group, and by fact 3, its center is nontrivial. Let's denote the center of G/Z(G) as Z(G/Z(G)).\n\nNow, consider the correspondence theorem, which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of G/Z(G) and the subgroups of G containing Z(G). Since Z(G/Z(G)) is nontrivial, there exists a nontrivial subgroup H of G containing Z(G) such that H/Z(G) = Z(G/Z(G)). The order of H is |Z(G)| * |Z(G/Z(G))| = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nNow, we have a group G of order 27 and a normal subgroup H of order 9. By the second isomorphism theorem, we have G/H is isomorphic to G/(H ∩ G) = G/Z(G), which has order 9. Since there are only two groups of order 9 up to isomorphism, namely the cyclic group C9 and the direct product C3 × C3, we conclude that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nCase 2: The center of G is trivial.\n\nThis case contradicts fact 3, which states that the center of a finite p-group is nontrivial. Therefore, this case is not possible, and we don't need to consider it further.\n\nIn conclusion, if the center of G has order 3, then G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27. If the center of G is trivial, this contradicts the fact that the center of a finite p-group is nontrivial, so this case is not possible."
