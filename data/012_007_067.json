Find the maximum flow from source node S to sink node T.\n\n```\n             16\n        S -----► A\n       / |      / \\\n     13  |     /   \\ 10\n     /   |    /     \\\n    B    |   /       C\n     \\   |  /        |\n     20 \\| / 8       | 8\n         ► D ------► T\n             12\n```\n\nWhat is the maximum flow that can be sent from S to T through this network?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from S to T, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, let's find an augmenting path: S -> A -> C -> T. The bottleneck capacity of this path is min(16, 10, 8) = 8. Update the flow along this path:\n\n```\n             8/16\n        S -----► A\n       / |      / \\\n     13  |     /   \\ 8/10\n     /   |    /     \\\n    B    |   /       C\n     \\   |  /        |\n     20 \\| / 8       | 0/8\n         ► D ------► T\n             12\n```\n\n2. Next, find another augmenting path: S -> A -> D -> T. The bottleneck capacity of this path is min(8, 8, 12) = 8. Update the flow along this path:\n\n```\n             16/16\n        S -----► A\n       / |      / \\\n     13  |     /   \\ 8/10\n     /   |    /     \\\n    B    |   /       C\n     \\   |  /        |\n     20 \\| / 0/8     | 0/8\n         ► D ------► T\n             8/12\n```\n\n3. Now, find another augmenting path: S -> B -> D -> T. The bottleneck capacity of this path is min(13, 20, 4) = 4. Update the flow along this path:\n\n```\n             16/16\n        S -----► A\n       / |      / \\\n     4/13|     /   \\ 8/10\n     /   |    /     \\\n    B    |   /       C\n     \\   |  /        |\n     4/20 \\| / 0/8     | 0/8\n         ► D ------► T\n             12/12\n```\n\n4. Finally, find another augmenting path: S -> B -> A -> C -> T. The bottleneck capacity of this path is min(9, 16, 2, 8) = 2. Update the flow along this path:\n\n```\n             18/16\n        S -----► A\n       / |      / \\\n     6/13|     /   \\ 10/10\n     /   |    /     \\\n    B    |   /       C\n     \\   |  /        |\n     4/20 \\| / 2/8     | 2/8\n         ► D ------► T\n             12/12\n```\n\nNow, there are no more augmenting paths available. The maximum flow from S to T is the sum of the flows into T: 8 + 12 = 20."
