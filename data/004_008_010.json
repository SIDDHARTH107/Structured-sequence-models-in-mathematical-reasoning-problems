    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 2 at the point where x = 1, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 1.\n\nThe derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 + 4x - 4\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = 1:\n\ndy/dx(1) = 3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 4\ndy/dx(1) = 3 + 4 - 4\ndy/dx(1) = 3\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 2 at the point where x = 1 is 3."
