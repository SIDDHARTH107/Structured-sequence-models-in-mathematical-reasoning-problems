    "message_2": "To calculate the Gaussian curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the parametrization with respect to u and v:\n\nx_u = ∂x/∂u = cos(v)\ny_u = ∂y/∂u = sin(v)\nz_u = ∂z/∂u = 1/u\n\nx_v = ∂x/∂v = -u sin(v)\ny_v = ∂y/∂v = u cos(v)\nz_v = ∂z/∂v = 0\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <x_u, x_u> = (cos(v))^2 + (sin(v))^2 + (1/u)^2\nF = <x_u, x_v> = -u cos(v) sin(v) + u sin(v) cos(v) = 0\nG = <x_v, x_v> = (u sin(v))^2 + (u cos(v))^2 = u^2\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivatives of the parametrization:\n\nx_uu = ∂²x/∂u² = 0\ny_uu = ∂²y/∂u² = 0\nz_uu = ∂²z/∂u² = -1/u^2\n\nx_uv = ∂²x/∂u∂v = -sin(v)\ny_uv = ∂²y/∂u∂v = cos(v)\nz_uv = ∂²z/∂u∂v = 0\n\nx_vv = ∂²x/∂v² = -u cos(v)\ny_vv = ∂²y/∂v² = -u sin(v)\nz_vv = ∂²z/∂v² = 0\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <x_uu, N> = -1/u^2\nM = <x_uv, N> = 0\nN = <x_vv, N> = 0\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)\n\nAt the point u = 2 and v = π/4, we have:\n\nE = (cos(π/4))^2 + (sin(π/4))^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 5/4\nF = 0\nG = (2)^2 = 4\nL = -1/(2^2) = -1/4\nM = 0\nN = 0\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature K is:\n\nK = (-1/4 * 0 - 0²) / (5/4 * 4 - 0²) = 0\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point where u = 2 and v = π/4 is 0."
