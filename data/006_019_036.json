    "message_2": "To find the probability of a random voter being selected from each group, we simply need to look at the percentage of each group in the population.\n\nThe probability of selecting a Republican voter is 35% or 0.35.\nThe probability of selecting a Democrat voter is 40% or 0.40.\nThe probability of selecting an Independent voter is 25% or 0.25.\n\nSince these are the only three groups in the population and they cover 100% of the population, the probability of selecting a random voter from any of these groups is 1 or 100%."
