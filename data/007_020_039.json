    "message_1": "Let's say Bob wants to send a confidential message to Alice using RSA encryption. Bob chooses two prime numbers p=11 and q=7. He also chooses a public key exponent e=17. \n1. Find the modulo n, which is the product of p and q. \n2. Using the Euler Totient function, calculate the number of integers less than n that are relatively prime to n. \n3. Calculate the private key exponent d, which is the inverse of e modulo n. \n4. If Bob wants to send the message \"HELLO\", where each letter is represented by a number from 1 to 26, encrypt the message using RSA and send it to Alice.",
    "message_2": "1. To find the modulo n, we multiply p and q:\nn = p * q = 11 * 7 = 77\n\n2. To calculate the Euler Totient function, we use the formula φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1):\nφ(n) = (11-1)(7-1) = 10 * 6 = 60\n\n3. To find the private key exponent d, we need to find the modular inverse of e (17) modulo φ(n) (60). In other words, we need to find a number d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1:\n17 * d ≡ 1 (mod 60)\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find d:\nd = 17^(-1) mod 60 = 53\n\n4. To encrypt the message \"HELLO\", we first convert each letter to a number from 1 to 26:\nH=8, E=5, L=12, L=12, O=15\n\nNow, we encrypt each number using the RSA encryption formula: ciphertext = (plaintext^e) % n\nC_H = (8^17) % 77 = 71\nC_E = (5^17) % 77 = 62\nC_L = (12^17) % 77 = 49\nC_L = (12^17) % 77 = 49\nC_O = (15^17) % 77 = 4\n\nThe encrypted message is 71, 62, 49, 49, 4. Bob sends this encrypted message to Alice."
