    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t (in years). We are given that P(0) = 2000 and P(4) = 4000. Since the growth rate is proportional to the size of the population, we can model the population growth using the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P(0) * e^(kt)\n\nwhere k is the growth constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of k. We can use the information that the population doubles in 4 years:\n\n4000 = 2000 * e^(4k)\n\nDivide both sides by 2000:\n\n2 = e^(4k)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = ln(e^(4k))\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that ln(a^b) = b * ln(a), we get:\n\nln(2) = 4k * ln(e)\n\nSince ln(e) = 1, we have:\n\nln(2) = 4k\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nk = ln(2) / 4\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can find the population after 10 years:\n\nP(10) = P(0) * e^(10k)\nP(10) = 2000 * e^(10 * (ln(2) / 4))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(10) ≈ 2000 * e^(2.5 * ln(2)) ≈ 2000 * 5.656854 ≈ 11313.708\n\nSo, the population after 10 years will be approximately 11,314 rabbits."
