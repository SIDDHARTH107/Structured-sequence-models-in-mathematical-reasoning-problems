    "message_2": "1. To find all the rational points on the curve, we will use the group law for elliptic curves. The given equation is an elliptic curve in the form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$, with $A = -4$ and $B = 0$. The group law states that if we have two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on the curve, then their sum $R = P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is also on the curve, and the coordinates of $R$ can be computed as follows:\n\nIf $x_1 \\neq x_2$, then\n$$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2$$\n$$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$$\nwhere $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n\nIf $P = Q$ and $y_1 \\neq 0$, then\n$$x_3 = m^2 - 2x_1$$\n$$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$$\nwhere $m = \\frac{3x_1^2 + A}{2y_1}$.\n\nNow, let's find the rational points on the curve. We know that the point $O = (0, 0)$ is on the curve. Let's find other rational points by adding $O$ to itself. Since $O$ is the identity element in the group law, we have $O + O = O$. Now, let's find the points of order 2, i.e., the points $P$ such that $P + P = O$. This means that $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$. Using the group law for $P = Q$, we get:\n\n$$x_3 = \\frac{3x_1^2 - 4}{2y_1}$$\n\nSince $P + P = O$, we have $x_3 = 0$. Thus,\n\n$$\\frac{3x_1^2 - 4}{2y_1} = 0$$\n\nThis implies that $3x_1^2 = 4$. So, $x_1 = \\pm \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$. However, we are looking for rational points, so we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$ to get $x_1 = \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. Plugging these values into the curve equation, we get:\n\n$$y_1^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^3 - 4\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get $y_1^2 = \\frac{32}{27} - \\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. This is not a square of a rational number, so there are no points of order 2.\n\nNow, let's find the points of order 3. We know that $O$ is a point of order 3, so we need to find the points $P$ such that $P + P + P = O$. We can write this as $P + (P + P) = O$. Using the group law, we can find the coordinates of $P + P$ and then use the group law again to find the coordinates of $P + (P + P)$. We will not go through the entire calculation here, but it can be shown that there are no points of order 3.\n\nSince there are no points of order 2 or 3, and the sum of two points of order 2 or 3 is also a rational point, we can conclude that there are no other rational points on the curve besides the point $O = (0, 0)$.\n\n2. To show that the point $(2, 2)$ is a point of infinite order on the curve, we need to show that for any positive integer $n$, there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $nP = mP$, where $P = (2, 2)$. We will use the group law to compute the coordinates of $nP$ for various values of $n$.\n\nFor $n = 1$, we have $P = (2, 2)$.\n\nFor $n = 2$, using the group law for $P = Q$, we get:\n\n$$m = \\frac{3x_1^2 - 4}{2y_1} = \\frac{12 - 4}{4} = 2$$\n\n$$x_3 = m^2 - 2x_1 = 4 - 4 = 0$$\n\n$$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 = 2(2 - 0) - 2 = 2$$\n\nSo, $2P = (0, 2)$.\n\nFor $n = 3$, using the group law for $P \\neq Q$, we get:\n\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{2 - 2}{0 - 2} = 0$$\n\n$$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2 = 0 - 2 - 0 = -2$$\n\n$$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 = 0(2 - (-2)) - 2 = -2$$\n\nSo, $3P = (-2, -2)$.\n\nWe can continue this process for larger values of $n$, and we will find that the coordinates of $nP$ are always distinct. This shows that the point $(2, 2)$ is a point of infinite order on the curve."
