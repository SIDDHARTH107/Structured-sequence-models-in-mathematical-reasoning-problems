    "message_1": "What is the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company if the company has 100 employees and 10 of them are known to have committed financial fraud in the past?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of financial fraud occurring in the company, we can use the information given about the employees who have committed financial fraud in the past. \n\nThere are 10 employees out of 100 who have committed financial fraud in the past. Assuming that the past behavior is an indicator of the likelihood of future fraud, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n\nProbability of financial fraud = (Number of employees who have committed financial fraud in the past) / (Total number of employees)\n\nProbability of financial fraud = 10 / 100\n\nProbability of financial fraud = 0.1 or 10%\n\nSo, the probability of a financial fraud occurring in the company is 10%. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified calculation and doesn't take into account other factors that could influence the likelihood of financial fraud."
