    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the particle at time $t = 2$ seconds, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time, which will give us the acceleration function. \n\nThe velocity function is given by $v(t) = 4t^3 - 18t^2 + 24t - 5$. \n\nTaking the derivative with respect to time, we get:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(4t^3 - 18t^2 + 24t - 5) = 12t^2 - 36t + 24$\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at $t = 2$ seconds. Plug in $t = 2$ into the acceleration function:\n\n$a(2) = 12(2)^2 - 36(2) + 24 = 12(4) - 72 + 24 = 48 - 72 + 24 = 0$\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle at time $t = 2$ seconds is 0 m/sÂ²."
