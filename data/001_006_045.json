    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x - 5, we can first find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nVertex (h, k) = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = -5. So, we have:\n\nh = -4/(2*1) = -2\nk = f(-2) = (-2)^2 + 4*(-2) - 5 = 4 - 8 - 5 = -9\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-2, -9).\n\nNow, let's find the x-intercepts (if any) by setting y = 0:\n\n0 = x^2 + 4x - 5\n\nTo find the x-intercepts, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4*1*(-5))) / 2*1\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 20)) / 2\nx = (-4 ± √36) / 2\nx = (-4 ± 6) / 2\n\nSo, we have two x-intercepts:\n\nx1 = (-4 + 6) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\nx2 = (-4 - 6) / 2 = -10 / 2 = -5\n\nThe x-intercepts are (1, 0) and (-5, 0).\n\nNow, we can graph the parabola with the vertex (-2, -9) and x-intercepts (1, 0) and (-5, 0). The parabola opens upwards since the coefficient of the x^2 term (a) is positive.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph:\n\n```\n         ^\n         |\n         |\n         |\n    (1,0) x       x (-5,0)\n         |         V\n         |       (-2,-9)\n         +------------------------>\n```\n\nThe parabola is symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = -2, which passes through the vertex."
