    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a sample of 200 individuals, exactly 10 will be affected by a disease that is known to affect 5% of the population in a certain demographic group?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of individuals in the sample, which is 200)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of individuals affected by the disease, which is 10)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of being affected by the disease, which is 5% or 0.05)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) = (200 choose 10) * 0.05^10 * (1-0.05)^(200-10)\n\nFirst, let's calculate (200 choose 10):\n\n(200 choose 10) = 200! / (10!(200-10)!) = 200! / (10!190!) ≈ 1.383×10^11\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 1.383×10^11 * 0.05^10 * 0.95^190 ≈ 0.0103\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 out of 200 individuals will be affected by the disease is approximately 1.03%."
