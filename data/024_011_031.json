    "message_2": "To find the Laplacian of the function f(x, y, z) = 4x^2 - y^2 - 2z^2, we first need to find the second partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n∂f/∂x = 8x\n∂f/∂y = -2y\n∂f/∂z = -4z\n\nNow, we find the second partial derivatives:\n∂²f/∂x² = 8\n∂²f/∂y² = -2\n∂²f/∂z² = -4\n\nThe Laplacian of a function is given by the sum of its second partial derivatives:\nΔf = ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² + ∂²f/∂z²\n\nSo, the Laplacian of f(x, y, z) is:\nΔf = 8 - 2 - 4 = 2\n\nNow, we evaluate the Laplacian at the point (1, 1, 1) on the sphere:\nΔf(1, 1, 1) = 2\n\nTherefore, the Laplacian of the function f(x, y, z) = 4x^2 - y^2 - 2z^2 at the point (1, 1, 1) on the sphere is 2."
