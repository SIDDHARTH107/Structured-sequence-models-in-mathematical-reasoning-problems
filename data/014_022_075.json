    "message_1": "A message encrypted using Playfair cipher has the following ciphertext: \"JURRYMKPQO\". Determine the plaintext message if the key used for encryption is \"MATHS\".",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"JURRYMKPQO\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key.\n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters from left to right, top to bottom in a 5x5 grid.\n2. Fill in the remaining spaces in the grid with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J' since 'I' and 'J' are treated as the same letter in the Playfair cipher) in alphabetical order.\n\nThe Playfair matrix with the key \"MATHS\" looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the ciphertext:\n\n1. Break the ciphertext into pairs of letters: JU RR YM KP QO\n2. For each pair of letters, locate them in the matrix and apply the decryption rules:\n   a. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrapping around if necessary).\n   b. If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrapping around if necessary).\n   c. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other pair's column.\n\nDecrypting the pairs:\n\nJU -> SE\nRR -> CR\nYM -> ET\nKP -> ME\nQO -> SS\n\nThe decrypted plaintext message is: \"SECRETMESS\". Note that the last 'S' might be an added padding letter (called a null) to make the plaintext have an even number of letters. So, the final plaintext message could be \"SECRETMES\"."
