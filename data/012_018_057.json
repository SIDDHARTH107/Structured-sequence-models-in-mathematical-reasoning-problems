    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least one isolated vertex or separate the graph into two or more disconnected components.\n\nLet's consider the minimum degree of the vertices in the graph. By the Handshaking Lemma, we know that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nâˆ‘(degree of vertices) = 2 * 14 = 28\n\nSince there are 8 vertices, the average degree of a vertex is 28 / 8 = 3.5. Since the degree of a vertex must be an integer, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher.\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we can focus on removing edges from the vertex with the highest degree. By doing so, we can minimize the number of edges we need to remove to disconnect the graph.\n\nIf there is a vertex with a degree of 4, we need to remove all 4 edges connected to that vertex to make it isolated and disconnect the graph. If there is a vertex with a degree of 5 or higher, we still only need to remove 4 edges, as removing 4 edges will separate the graph into two disconnected components.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 4."
