    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 5) / (7x - 4) using the quotient rule, we first need to identify the numerator function (u) and the denominator function (v). In this case, u(x) = 3x^2 - 5 and v(x) = 7x - 4.\n\nThe quotient rule states that the derivative of a function f(x) = u(x) / v(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(3x^2 - 5)/dx = 6x\nv'(x) = d(7x - 4)/dx = 7\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\nf'(x) = (6x(7x - 4) - (3x^2 - 5)(7)) / (7x - 4)^2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (42x^2 - 24x - 21x^2 + 35) / (49x^2 - 56x + 16)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nf'(x) = (21x^2 - 24x + 35) / (49x^2 - 56x + 16)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 5) / (7x - 4) is:\n\nf'(x) = (21x^2 - 24x + 35) / (49x^2 - 56x + 16)"
