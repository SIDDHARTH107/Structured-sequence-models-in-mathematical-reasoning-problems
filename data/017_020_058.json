    "message_1": "Consider a group G of order 40. If G is non-abelian, then how many non-isomorphic groups of order 40 are there, and what are their structures?",
    "message_2": "To find the non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. Let's find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 5. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. If n_2 = 5, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G.\n\n2. Sylow 5-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1. This means there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since both subgroups are normal, their product P_2 * P_5 is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since P_2 and P_5 have trivial intersection, the order of P_2 * P_5 is 8 * 5 = 40, which is the order of G. Thus, G is the direct product of P_2 and P_5, i.e., G = P_2 x P_5. Since P_5 is cyclic (of prime order), the only possibility for G to be non-abelian is if P_2 is non-abelian. The only non-abelian group of order 8 is the dihedral group D_4. Therefore, in this case, G is isomorphic to D_4 x Z_5.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has 5 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since P_5 is normal, we can form the semidirect product of P_2 and P_5, denoted as P_2 â‹Š P_5. The structure of this semidirect product depends on the action of P_5 on P_2. Since P_5 is cyclic of order 5, there are four possible actions (automorphisms) of P_5 on P_2. However, not all of them will result in non-isomorphic groups. In fact, only one of these actions will result in a non-isomorphic group, which is the semidirect product of a Sylow 2-subgroup and Z_5. This group is called the Frobenius group of order 40, denoted as F_40.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 40: D_4 x Z_5 and F_40."
