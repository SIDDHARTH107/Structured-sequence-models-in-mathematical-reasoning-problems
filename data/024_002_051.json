    "message_2": "To find the geodesic path on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. The shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere is along the great circle that connects them.\n\nGiven a sphere with radius 2 units, and points A(1, 0, 0) and B(0, 1, 0), we can find the great circle that connects them.\n\nFirst, let's find the angle between the two points on the sphere. We can use the dot product formula for this:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||)\n\nwhere A and B are the position vectors of points A and B, respectively, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nA = (1, 0, 0)\nB = (0, 1, 0)\n\nA · B = (1 * 0) + (0 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 0\n\n||A|| = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = 1\n||B|| = sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = 1\n\ncos(θ) = 0 / (1 * 1) = 0\n\nθ = arccos(0) = 90 degrees or π/2 radians\n\nNow that we have the angle between the two points, we can find the length of the geodesic path by using the formula:\n\nLength = radius * θ\n\nLength = 2 * (π/2) = π units\n\nSo, the length of the geodesic path between points A and B on the surface of the sphere with a radius of 2 units is π units."
