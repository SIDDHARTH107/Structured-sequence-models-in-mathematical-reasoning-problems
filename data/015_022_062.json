    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a nonlinear delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = β * x(t - τ) / (1 + x(t - τ)^n) - γ * x(t)\n\nwhere β, γ, τ, and n are parameters, and x(t) is the time-dependent variable. To find the period of the equation with the given parameter values (β=0.2, γ=0.1, τ=17, and n=10,000) and initial condition x(1)=1.5, we would need to numerically solve the equation and analyze its behavior over time.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I am not capable of performing such complex numerical simulations. I recommend using specialized software or programming languages like MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica to solve the Mackey-Glass equation and determine its period for the given parameters and initial condition."
