    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $10 and from each unit of product B is $15. The plant can produce a maximum of 500 units per day, and the production of product B cannot exceed the production of product A. The plant must produce at least 100 units of product A per day. The production process requires 1 hour for each unit of product A and 2 hours for each unit of product B. The plant can operate for a maximum of 10 hours per day. What is the optimal production quantity of both products to maximize the daily profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Total production cannot exceed 500 units per day: x + y ≤ 500\n2. Production of product B cannot exceed the production of product A: y ≤ x\n3. The plant must produce at least 100 units of product A per day: x ≥ 100\n4. The production process requires 1 hour for each unit of product A and 2 hours for each unit of product B, and the plant can operate for a maximum of 10 hours per day: x + 2y ≤ 10\n\nThe objective function to maximize the daily profit is P = 10x + 15y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 500\n2. y ≤ x\n3. x ≥ 100\n4. x + 2y ≤ 10\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all these constraints. Now we need to find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. (100, 0): Intersection of x = 100 and y = 0\n2. (100, 5): Intersection of x = 100 and x + 2y = 10\n3. (5, 5): Intersection of x + 2y = 10 and y = x\n\nNow we need to evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 15y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(100, 0) = 10(100) + 15(0) = 1000\n2. P(100, 5) = 10(100) + 15(5) = 1000 + 75 = 1075\n3. P(5, 5) = 10(5) + 15(5) = 50 + 75 = 125\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (100, 5), with a profit of $1075. Therefore, the optimal production quantity is 100 units of product A and 5 units of product B."
