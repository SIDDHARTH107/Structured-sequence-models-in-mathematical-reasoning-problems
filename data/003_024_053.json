    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector v onto vector u using trigonometry, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can do this using the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of vectors v and u is given by:\n\nv · u = |v| |u| cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors, |v| is the magnitude of vector v, and |u| is the magnitude of vector u.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of v and u:\n\nv · u = (4)(6) + (3)(8) = 24 + 24 = 48\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of v and u:\n\n|v| = √(4² + 3²) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n|u| = √(6² + 8²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10\n\nNow we can find the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (v · u) / (|v| |u|) = 48 / (5 * 10) = 48 / 50 = 0.96\n\nNow we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(0.96) ≈ 16.26°\n\nFinally, we can find the projection of vector v onto vector u:\n\nproj_u(v) = |v| cos(θ) * (u / |u|)\n\n|v| cos(θ) = 5 * 0.96 ≈ 4.8\n\nu / |u| = [6/10, 8/10] = [0.6, 0.8]\n\nproj_u(v) = 4.8 * [0.6, 0.8] = [2.88, 3.84]\n\nSo, the projection of vector v onto vector u is approximately [2.88, 3.84]."
