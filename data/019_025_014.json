    "message_1": "Here is a causal logic problem for a math student to solve:\nSuppose that the temperature of a chemical reaction increases at a rate of 5 degrees Celsius per minute. If the initial temperature of the reaction was 20 degrees Celsius, what will be its temperature in 8 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal temperature = Initial temperature + (Rate of increase * Time)\n\nIn this case, the initial temperature is 20 degrees Celsius, the rate of increase is 5 degrees Celsius per minute, and the time is 8 minutes.\n\nFinal temperature = 20 + (5 * 8)\n\nFinal temperature = 20 + 40\n\nFinal temperature = 60 degrees Celsius\n\nSo, the temperature of the chemical reaction in 8 minutes will be 60 degrees Celsius."
