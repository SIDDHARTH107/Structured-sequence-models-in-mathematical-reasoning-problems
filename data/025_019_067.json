    "message_1": "Let $X$ be a Fano variety of dimension 2 with Picard number 1 and Picard group $\\text{Pic}(X)=\\langle D \\rangle$, where $D$ is an ample divisor on $X$. If $C$ is a smooth curve on $X$ with $C^2=-1$, what is the degree of $C$ with respect to the ample divisor $D$?",
    "message_2": "Since $X$ is a Fano variety of dimension 2, it has a positive anticanonical divisor, i.e., $-K_X$ is ample. Moreover, since the Picard number is 1, we have that $-K_X = aD$ for some positive integer $a$. \n\nNow, let's compute the intersection product of $C$ with $-K_X$. Using the adjunction formula, we have:\n\n$K_C = (K_X + C)|_C = -K_X|_C + C^2 = -aD|_C - 1$.\n\nSince $C$ is a smooth curve, $K_C$ is a divisor of degree $2g(C) - 2$, where $g(C)$ is the genus of $C$. We know that $C^2 = -1$, so $g(C) = 0$ (because a curve with negative self-intersection and positive genus cannot be smooth). Thus, $K_C$ is a divisor of degree $-2$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$-2 = -aD|_C - 1$.\n\nSolving for $D|_C$, we get:\n\n$D|_C = a - 1$.\n\nSo, the degree of $C$ with respect to the ample divisor $D$ is $a - 1$."
