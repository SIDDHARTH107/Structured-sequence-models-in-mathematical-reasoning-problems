The production of each product requires different amounts of labor and materials, as shown below:\n\n| Product | Labor required (hours) | Material required (tons) |\n|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n| A       | 2                     | 3                        |\n| B       | 4                     | 1                        |\n| C       | 1                     | 2                        |\n\nThe company has 200 hours of labor and 120 tons of material available each day. The profit per unit for each product is $10 for A, $15 for B, and $12 for C.\n\nFormulate this problem as a mixed-integer programming problem to determine the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize profits while meeting the labor and material constraints.",
    "message_2": "Let x_A, x_B, and x_C be the number of units of products A, B, and C produced, respectively. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 10x_A + 15x_B + 12x_C\n\nSubject to the labor and material constraints:\n\nLabor constraint: 2x_A + 4x_B + 1x_C <= 200\nMaterial constraint: 3x_A + 1x_B + 2x_C <= 120\n\nAnd the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx_A >= 0\nx_B >= 0\nx_C >= 0\n\nSince the number of units produced must be integers, we have:\n\nx_A, x_B, x_C âˆˆ Z (integer values)\n\nThis mixed-integer programming problem can be solved using various optimization techniques or software to find the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize profits while meeting the labor and material constraints."
