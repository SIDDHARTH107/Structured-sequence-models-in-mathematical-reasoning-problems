    "message_2": "The maximum height above the ground reached by a passenger on a Ferris wheel can be found by adding the radius of the wheel to the distance from the ground to the center of the wheel. Since the Ferris wheel has a radius of 20 meters, and the center of the wheel is also 20 meters above the ground, the maximum height a passenger will reach is:\n\n20 meters (radius) + 20 meters (distance from ground to center) = 40 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height above the ground reached by a passenger is 40 meters."
