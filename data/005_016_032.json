    "message_1": "A company wants to classify their employees into three different salary brackets based on their age and years of experience. Using discriminant analysis, can you help the company determine the discriminant function coefficients that classify the employees into these brackets? Here is the data:\n\n- Salary Bracket 1: Age 25, Experience 3, Salary $30,000\n- Salary Bracket 2: Age 35, Experience 8, Salary $50,000\n- Salary Bracket 3: Age 40, Experience 12, Salary $70,000",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we first need to calculate the means and covariance matrices for each salary bracket. Let's denote Age as X1 and Experience as X2.\n\nMean vectors for each salary bracket:\n- Mean1 = [25, 3]\n- Mean2 = [35, 8]\n- Mean3 = [40, 12]\n\nSince we only have one data point per salary bracket, we cannot compute the covariance matrices directly. However, we can assume that the covariance matrices are equal for all three salary brackets, and estimate the covariance matrix using the entire dataset.\n\nCovariance matrix (S):\n[[((25-33.33)^2 + (35-33.33)^2 + (40-33.33)^2)/3, ((25-33.33)*(3-7.67) + (35-33.33)*(8-7.67) + (40-33.33)*(12-7.67))/3],\n [((25-33.33)*(3-7.67) + (35-33.33)*(8-7.67) + (40-33.33)*(12-7.67))/3, ((3-7.67)^2 + (8-7.67)^2 + (12-7.67)^2)/3]]\n\nS = [[50.89, 47.78],\n        [47.78, 27.56]]\n\nNow we can compute the discriminant function coefficients for each salary bracket:\n\nDiscriminant function coefficients (D):\n- D1 = inv(S) * Mean1 = [0.012, -0.004]\n- D2 = inv(S) * Mean2 = [0.018, 0.002]\n- D3 = inv(S) * Mean3 = [0.020, 0.006]\n\nNow we can classify employees into salary brackets using the discriminant functions:\n\n- Salary Bracket 1: D1 = 0.012 * Age - 0.004 * Experience\n- Salary Bracket 2: D2 = 0.018 * Age + 0.002 * Experience\n- Salary Bracket 3: D3 = 0.020 * Age + 0.006 * Experience\n\nTo classify an employee, calculate the values for D1, D2, and D3 using their age and experience, and assign them to the salary bracket with the highest discriminant function value."
