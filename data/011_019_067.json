    "message_2": "An orthogonal array OA(n, k, s, t) is an n × k array with entries from a set of s symbols, such that in any t columns, each possible t-tuple of symbols appears exactly λ times, where λ is the index of the array.\n\nIn the given orthogonal array OA(12, 5, 2, 3), we have n = 12 rows, k = 5 columns, s = 2 symbols (usually 0 and 1), and t = 3. The index λ can be calculated as λ = n / (s^t) = 12 / (2^3) = 12 / 8 = 1.5. Since λ must be an integer, there is an error in the problem statement, and an orthogonal array with these parameters does not exist.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the problem meant to ask for an OA(8, 5, 2, 3) array, we can proceed with the calculations. In this case, λ = n / (s^t) = 8 / (2^3) = 8 / 8 = 1.\n\nTo determine the number of orthogonal arrays of the same kind that can be constructed from this array through swapping of rows or columns, we need to consider the permutations of rows and columns.\n\nFor the rows, there are 8! (8 factorial) ways to permute the rows. However, since there are 2^3 = 8 rows with each possible 3-tuple appearing once, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange these 8 rows, which is 3! for each of the 2 symbols. So, the number of row permutations is 8! / (3! * 3!) = 5,040 / (6 * 6) = 140.\n\nFor the columns, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to permute the columns. However, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the t = 3 columns, which is 3! = 6. So, the number of column permutations is 5! / 3! = 120 / 6 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the total number of orthogonal arrays of the same kind that can be constructed from this OA(8, 5, 2, 3) array through swapping of rows or columns is 140 * 20 = 2,800."
