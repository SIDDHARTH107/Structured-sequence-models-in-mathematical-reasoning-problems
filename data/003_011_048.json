    "message_1": "A person stands on the ground and sights the top of a building at an angle of elevation of 30 degrees. The person then walks 50 meters towards the building and sights the top of the building again at an angle of elevation of 45 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the building as h meters, and the initial distance from the person to the building as x meters. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles of elevation to the height and distance.\n\nFrom the first angle of elevation (30 degrees), we have:\n\ntan(30) = h/x\n(1) h = x * tan(30)\n\nFrom the second angle of elevation (45 degrees), after the person has walked 50 meters towards the building, we have:\n\ntan(45) = h/(x-50)\n(2) h = (x-50) * tan(45)\n\nSince both equations (1) and (2) represent the height of the building, we can set them equal to each other:\n\nx * tan(30) = (x-50) * tan(45)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx * (1/√3) = (x-50) * 1\nx/√3 = x - 50\n\nMultiplying both sides by √3:\n\nx = √3 * (x - 50)\n\nNow, let's isolate x:\n\nx - √3 * x = -50 * √3\nx * (1 - √3) = -50 * √3\n\nNow, divide both sides by (1 - √3):\n\nx = (-50 * √3) / (1 - √3)\n\nNow, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by (1 + √3):\n\nx = (-50 * √3 * (1 + √3)) / (1 - 3)\nx = (-50 * √3 - 150) / (-2)\nx = (50 * √3 + 150) / 2\n\nNow, we can plug x back into equation (1) to find the height of the building:\n\nh = (50 * √3 + 150) / 2 * tan(30)\nh = (50 * √3 + 150) / 2 * (1/√3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by √3:\n\nh = (50 * √3 + 150) / 2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nh = (50 * √3 + 150) / 4\n\nh ≈ (50 * 1.732 + 150) / 4\nh ≈ (86.6 + 150) / 4\nh ≈ 236.6 / 4\nh ≈ 59.15\n\nThe height of the building is approximately 59.15 meters."
