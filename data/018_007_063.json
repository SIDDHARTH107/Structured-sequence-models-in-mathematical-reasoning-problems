    "message_2": "Let A be a set with exactly 5 elements, i.e., |A| = 5. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. \n\nTo find the size of the power set, we can use the formula |P(A)| = 2^|A|, where |A| is the size of the set A. In this case, |P(A)| = 2^5 = 32. So, the size of the power set P(A) is 32.\n\nNow let's compare the size of P(A) to the size of A itself. Since |A| = 5 and |P(A)| = 32, we can see that the power set P(A) is larger than A.\n\nTo prove that the power set of A is always larger than A, we can use a general argument. Let A be a set with n elements, i.e., |A| = n. Then, the size of the power set P(A) is 2^n. Since n is a non-negative integer, 2^n is always greater than n for any n â‰¥ 1. \n\nFor example:\n- If n = 1, 2^n = 2 > 1.\n- If n = 2, 2^n = 4 > 2.\n- If n = 3, 2^n = 8 > 3.\n\nAnd so on. Therefore, the power set of A is always larger than A."
