    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = 2x - 1 with a period of 2, we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period, n is an integer, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, the period is 2, so L = 1.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0)] dx from -L to L\na_0 = (1 / 1) * ∫[f(x)] dx from -1 to 1\na_0 = ∫[(2x - 1)] dx from -1 to 1\na_0 = [x^2 - x] from -1 to 1\na_0 = (1 - 1) - ((-1)^2 - (-1))\na_0 = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L)] dx from -L to L\na_n = (1 / 1) * ∫[(2x - 1) * cos(n * π * x)] dx from -1 to 1\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\na_n = [(2x - 1) * (sin(n * π * x) / (n * π))] from -1 to 1 - ∫[sin(n * π * x) / (n * π)] dx from -1 to 1\na_n = 0 - (2 / (n^2 * π^2)) * ∫[sin(n * π * x)] dx from -1 to 1\na_n = 0 - (2 / (n^2 * π^2)) * [-cos(n * π * x) / (n * π)] from -1 to 1\na_n = (2 / (n^3 * π^3)) * [cos(n * π * x)] from -1 to 1\na_n = (2 / (n^3 * π^3)) * [cos(n * π) - cos(-n * π)]\na_n = (2 / (n^3 * π^3)) * [(-1)^n - (-1)^n]\na_n = 0\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)] dx from -L to L\nb_n = (1 / 1) * ∫[(2x - 1) * sin(n * π * x)] dx from -1 to 1\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\nb_n = [(2x - 1) * (-cos(n * π * x) / (n * π))] from -1 to 1 - ∫[-cos(n * π * x) / (n * π)] dx from -1 to 1\nb_n = [(-2x + 1) * cos(n * π * x) / (n * π)] from -1 to 1 + (1 / (n * π)) * ∫[cos(n * π * x)] dx from -1 to 1\nb_n = [(-2 + 2 * cos(n * π)) / (n * π)] + (1 / (n * π)) * [sin(n * π * x) / (n * π)] from -1 to 1\nb_n = [(-2 + 2 * cos(n * π)) / (n * π)] + (1 / (n^2 * π^2)) * [sin(n * π) - sin(-n * π)]\nb_n = [(-2 + 2 * cos(n * π)) / (n * π)]\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = 2x - 1 with a period of 2 is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [((-2 + 2 * cos(n * π)) / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
