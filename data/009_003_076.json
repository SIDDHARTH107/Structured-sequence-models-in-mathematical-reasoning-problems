The two shorter sides are insulated and the two longer sides are kept at a constant temperature of 0°C. The temperature at any point in the plate is given by the function u(x,y,t). \n\na) Write the heat diffusion equation for this situation.\nb) Find the solution to this equation subject to the initial condition u(x,y,0) = 100.\nc) Find the temperature at the center of the plate after 10 minutes.",
    "message_2": "a) The heat diffusion equation, also known as the heat equation, is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the material, which is a constant.\n\nb) To find the solution to this equation subject to the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = 100, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of x, y, and t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = α(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nDividing both sides by αX(x)Y(y)T(t), we obtain:\n\n(1/αT(t))dT(t)/dt = (1/X(x))X''(x) + (1/Y(y))Y''(y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/αT(t))dT(t)/dt = -λ²\n(1/X(x))X''(x) + (1/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) - λ²Y(y) = 0\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nSince the temperature is 0 at x = 0 and x = 2, we have:\n\nX(0) = A = 0\nX(2) = 2B*sin(2λ) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be 0 (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(2λ) = 0, which implies λ = nπ/2 for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSo, X(x) = B_n*sin(nπx/2) for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe general solution for Y(y) is:\n\nY(y) = C_n*cosh(nπy/2) + D_n*sinh(nπy/2)\n\nSince the temperature is 0 at y = 1, we have:\n\nY(1) = C_n*cosh(nπ/2) + D_n*sinh(nπ/2) = 0\n\nThis implies D_n = -C_n*tanh(nπ/2), and so:\n\nY(y) = C_n(cosh(nπy/2) - tanh(nπ/2)*sinh(nπy/2))\n\nThe general solution for u(x, y, t) is then:\n\nu(x, y, t) = Σ[(C_n*sin(nπx/2))(cosh(nπy/2) - tanh(nπ/2)*sinh(nπy/2))]*T_n(t)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all positive integers n.\n\nTo find T_n(t) and C_n, we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = 100:\n\n100 = Σ[C_n*sin(nπx/2)(cosh(nπy/2) - tanh(nπ/2)*sinh(nπy/2))]\n\nWe can use Fourier sine series to find C_n:\n\nC_n = (2/1) * ∫[100*sin(nπx/2)]dx from 0 to 1\n\nC_n = (200/πn)(1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow we need to find T_n(t). From the equation (1/αT(t))dT(t)/dt = -λ², we have:\n\ndT(t)/dt = -α(nπ/2)²T(t)\n\nThe solution to this first-order linear ODE is:\n\nT_n(t) = exp(-α(nπ/2)²t)\n\nFinally, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = Σ[(200/πn)(1 - (-1)^n)sin(nπx/2)(cosh(nπy/2) - tanh(nπ/2)*sinh(nπy/2))]*exp(-α(nπ/2)²t)\n\nc) To find the temperature at the center of the plate (x = 1, y = 0.5) after 10 minutes (t = 600 seconds), we plug in these values into the solution:\n\nu(1, 0.5, 600) = Σ[(200/πn)(1 - (-1)^n)sin(nπ/2)(cosh(nπ/4) - tanh(nπ/2)*sinh(nπ/4))]*exp(-α(nπ/2)²*600)\n\nThis is an infinite series, and we need to know the value of α for the metal plate to compute the exact temperature. However, we can approximate the temperature by taking a finite number of terms in the series. The more terms we take, the more accurate the approximation will be."
