    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (-3, 4) and (2, 1), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The formula for the slope is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points, (-3, 4) as (x1, y1) and (2, 1) as (x2, y2), we can find the slope:\n\nm = (1 - 4) / (2 - (-3))\nm = (-3) / (5)\nm = -3/5\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line. The point-slope form is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the slope and one of the points, let's use (-3, 4):\n\ny - 4 = -3/5(x - (-3))\ny - 4 = -3/5(x + 3)\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\ny = -3/5(x + 3) + 4\n\nTo get rid of the parentheses, distribute -3/5:\n\ny = -3/5x - 9/5 + 4\n\nNow, let's convert 4 to a fraction with the same denominator as -9/5:\n\n4 = 20/5\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\ny = -3/5x - 9/5 + 20/5\ny = -3/5x + 11/5\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (-3, 4) and (2, 1) is:\n\ny = -3/5x + 11/5"
