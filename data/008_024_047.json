    "message_1": "Solve the system of linear equations for x, y, and z: \n\n- 3x + 2y - z = 4\n- 6x + 4y - 2z = 8\n- 9x + 6y - 3z = 12\n\nWhat is the solution for the equation set above?",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are not independent and actually represent the same line in 3D space. Therefore, there is no unique solution for x, y, and z. The system of equations has infinitely many solutions, and they all lie on the same line."
