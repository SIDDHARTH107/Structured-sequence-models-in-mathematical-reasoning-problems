    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-similar fractal, which means that after each iteration, the curve is made up of smaller copies of itself. In the case of the Lévy C curve, each line segment is replaced by two segments, each of which is √2 times shorter than the original segment and at a 45-degree angle to each other.\n\nTo find the total arc length after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nArc length = (initial length) * (scaling factor) ^ (number of iterations)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, the scaling factor is √2, and the number of iterations is 5.\n\nArc length = 1 * (√2) ^ 5\nArc length = 1 * (2^(5/2))\nArc length = 1 * (2^2.5)\nArc length = 1 * (5.656854249)\n\nThe total arc length of the Lévy C curve after 5 iterations is approximately 5.656854249 units."
