    "message_2": "The given second-order logic sentence can be translated as follows:\n\nThere exists a set X such that for all Y, Y is a member of X if and only if there exists a Z such that Y = 2Z.\n\nThis sentence describes a set X that contains all even natural numbers because Y is a member of X only if it can be written as 2 times some natural number Z.\n\nSince the set of even natural numbers is unique, there is only 1 set of natural numbers that satisfies the given second-order logic sentence."
