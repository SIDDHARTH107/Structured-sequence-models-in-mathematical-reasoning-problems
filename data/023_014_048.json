    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding the particle between x = -1 and x = 1, we need to calculate the integral of the square of the wave function (|ψ(x)|^2) over the given interval.\n\nFirst, let's find |ψ(x)|^2:\n\nψ(x) = (1/√2) (e^-x + e^x)\n|ψ(x)|^2 = ψ(x) * ψ*(x) = [(1/√2) (e^-x + e^x)] * [(1/√2) (e^-x + e^x)]\n\n|ψ(x)|^2 = (1/2) (e^-2x + 2 + e^2x)\n\nNow, we need to integrate |ψ(x)|^2 from x = -1 to x = 1:\n\n∫[-1, 1] (1/2) (e^-2x + 2 + e^2x) dx\n\nLet's break this integral into three parts:\n\n(1/2) ∫[-1, 1] e^-2x dx + (1/2) ∫[-1, 1] 2 dx + (1/2) ∫[-1, 1] e^2x dx\n\nNow, we can integrate each part:\n\n(1/2) [-1/2 * e^-2x] (-1 to 1) + (1/2) [2x] (-1 to 1) + (1/2) [1/2 * e^2x] (-1 to 1)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each part at the limits:\n\n(1/2) [-1/2 * (e^-2 - e^2)] + (1/2) [2 - (-2)] + (1/2) [1/2 * (e^2 - e^-2)]\n\nNow, let's simplify:\n\n(-1/4) (e^-2 - e^2) + 2 + (1/4) (e^2 - e^-2)\n\nNow, let's combine the terms with e^2 and e^-2:\n\n[-1/4 * e^-2 + 1/4 * e^2] + [1/4 * e^2 - 1/4 * e^-2] + 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n[1/2 * (e^2 - e^-2)] + 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerical value:\n\n[1/2 * (7.389056098930649 - 0.1353352832366127)] + 2 ≈ 3.626860407707963\n\nSo, the probability of finding the particle between x = -1 and x = 1 is approximately 0.626860407707963 or 62.69%."
