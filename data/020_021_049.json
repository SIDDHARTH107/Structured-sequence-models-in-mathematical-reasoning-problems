Machine X can operate for a maximum of 8 hours per day, while machine Y can operate for a maximum of 10 hours per day. Product A takes 2 hours of processing time on machine X and 3 hours on machine Y, while product B takes 4 hours of processing time on machine X and 1 hour on machine Y. If the profit from producing one unit of product A is $50 and from producing one unit of product B is $70, what is the optimal production schedule to maximize the daily profit of the factory?",
    "message_2": "Let's use linear programming to solve this problem. Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized): P = 50x + 70y\n\nConstraints (machine hours):\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 8 (Machine X hours)\n2. 3x + y ≤ 10 (Machine Y hours)\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y = 8 => y = 2 - 0.5x\n2. 3x + y = 10 => y = 10 - 3x\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (0,2), (2,1), and (4,0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 50(0) + 70(0) = $0\n2. P(0,2) = 50(0) + 70(2) = $140\n3. P(2,1) = 50(2) + 70(1) = $170\n4. P(4,0) = 50(4) + 70(0) = $200\n\nThe maximum profit is $200, which occurs when 4 units of product A and 0 units of product B are produced. Therefore, the optimal production schedule is to produce 4 units of product A and no units of product B."
