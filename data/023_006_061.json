    "message_1": "Consider a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ with the Fourier transform $X(\\omega)$. Suppose $x(t)$ is band-limited with a maximum frequency of 100 Hz. Calculate the values of $X(\\omega)$ for $\\omega$ greater than 200 Hz.",
    "message_2": "Since the signal $x(t)$ is band-limited with a maximum frequency of 100 Hz, its Fourier transform $X(\\omega)$ will have non-zero values only for frequencies within the range of -100 Hz to 100 Hz. For frequencies outside this range, the Fourier transform will be zero.\n\nTherefore, for $\\omega$ greater than 200 Hz, the value of $X(\\omega)$ will be:\n\n$X(\\omega) = 0$ for $\\omega > 200$ Hz."
