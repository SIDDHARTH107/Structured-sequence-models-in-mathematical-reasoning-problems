    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the fact that X is a topological space, which means it satisfies the axioms of open sets. In particular, we will use the fact that the union of open sets is open, and the intersection of a finite number of open sets is open.\n\nSince A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X, their complements, A^c and B^c, are open sets in X (by definition of closed sets). Now, consider the following:\n\n1. A ⊆ A^c^c: Since A^c is the complement of A, A^c^c is equal to A.\n2. B ⊆ B^c^c: Similarly, B^c^c is equal to B.\n\nNow, let's define the open sets U and V as follows:\n\nU = A^c^c ∩ B^c\nV = B^c^c ∩ A^c\n\nSince the intersection of open sets is open, both U and V are open sets. Moreover, A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V by construction.\n\nTo show that U and V are disjoint, suppose there exists an element x in U ∩ V. Then, x must be in both U and V. This means that x is in both A^c^c ∩ B^c and B^c^c ∩ A^c. Consequently, x is in both A^c and B^c, which implies that x is not in A and not in B. However, this contradicts the fact that A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X, so there cannot be any element x in U ∩ V. Therefore, U and V are disjoint open sets.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exist two disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V."
