    "message_1": "Sure, here is a problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA sample of a radioactive substance has an initial mass of 50 grams and a half-life of 10 days. Find the amount of the substance, to the nearest hundredth of a gram, that will be left after 30 days.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 50 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 50 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nFinal amount = 50 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 50 * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 6.25 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, there will be approximately 6.25 grams of the radioactive substance left, to the nearest hundredth of a gram."
