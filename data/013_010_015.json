    "message_1": "In a duopoly market, Firm A and Firm B both produce an identical product with a market demand function of Q = 200 – 2P. Both firms have a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit. Assuming the firms engage in a Cournot competition, what is the Nash equilibrium quantity that each firm will produce, and what is the market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium quantity and market price in a Cournot competition, we first need to determine the reaction functions for both Firm A and Firm B.\n\nLet qA be the quantity produced by Firm A and qB be the quantity produced by Firm B. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = qA + qB. From the market demand function, we can derive the price function as P = 100 - 0.5Q.\n\nFirm A's revenue is given by R_A = P * qA = (100 - 0.5Q) * qA = (100 - 0.5(qA + qB)) * qA.\nFirm B's revenue is given by R_B = P * qB = (100 - 0.5Q) * qB = (100 - 0.5(qA + qB)) * qB.\n\nSince both firms have a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit, their cost functions are C_A = 10 * qA and C_B = 10 * qB.\n\nNow, we can find the profit functions for both firms:\nΠ_A = R_A - C_A = (100 - 0.5(qA + qB)) * qA - 10 * qA\nΠ_B = R_B - C_B = (100 - 0.5(qA + qB)) * qB - 10 * qB\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit functions with respect to each firm's quantity produced. We do this by taking the first-order partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂Π_A/∂qA = 90 - qA - 0.5qB = 0\n∂Π_B/∂qB = 90 - qB - 0.5qA = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nqA = 90 - 0.5qB\nqB = 90 - 0.5qA\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation:\n\nqB = 90 - 0.5(90 - 0.5qB)\nqB = 90 - 45 + 0.25qB\n0.75qB = 45\nqB = 60\n\nNow, substituting qB back into the first equation:\n\nqA = 90 - 0.5(60)\nqA = 90 - 30\nqA = 60\n\nSo, in the Nash equilibrium, both Firm A and Firm B will produce 60 units each.\n\nTo find the market price, we can substitute the equilibrium quantities back into the price function:\n\nP = 100 - 0.5(Q)\nP = 100 - 0.5(60 + 60)\nP = 100 - 0.5(120)\nP = 100 - 60\nP = 40\n\nThus, the Nash equilibrium quantity for each firm is 60 units, and the market price is $40."
