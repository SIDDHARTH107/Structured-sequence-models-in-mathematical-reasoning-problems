    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that the order of g is 13, i.e., g generates the entire group G.\n\nSince G has order 13, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element g in G must divide 13. Since 13 is prime, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 13. The identity element e of G has order 1, so we need to find an element with order 13.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary non-identity element g in G. Since the order of g must divide 13, and g is not the identity element, the order of g must be 13. This means that the cyclic subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has 13 elements.\n\nNow, we know that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Since ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of G and has order 13, it must be the case that ⟨g⟩ = G. In other words, g generates the entire group G.\n\nTherefore, G is cyclic, and we have exhibited a generator g for G."
