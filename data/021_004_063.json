    "message_2": "To approximate the derivative of f(x) = x^3 at x = 2 using the forward difference method with a step size of h = 0.1, we can use the following formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nIn this case, x = 2 and h = 0.1. So, we have:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.1) - f(2)) / 0.1\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of f(2) and f(2 + 0.1):\n\nf(2) = 2^3 = 8\nf(2 + 0.1) = (2.1)^3 = 9.261\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (9.261 - 8) / 0.1 = 12.61\n\nSo, the approximation of the derivative of f(x) = x^3 at x = 2 using the forward difference method with a step size of h = 0.1 is 12.61.\n\nNow, let's find the true value of the derivative. The derivative of f(x) = x^3 is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2\n\nAt x = 2, the true value of the derivative is:\n\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 = 3(4) = 12\n\nComparing the true value of the derivative (12) with the approximation using the forward difference method (12.61), we can see that the approximation is close to the true value, with a small error due to the step size of h = 0.1."
