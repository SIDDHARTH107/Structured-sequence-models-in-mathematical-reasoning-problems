    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. After each iteration, the length of each side of the snowflake is multiplied by 4/3.\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of sides) * (4/3)^n\n\nFor the original equilateral triangle, the number of sides is 3. After the 4th iteration, we have:\n\nPerimeter = 10 * 3 * (4/3)^4\n\nPerimeter = 30 * (256/81)\n\nPerimeter ≈ 30 * 3.16049\n\nPerimeter ≈ 94.8147 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after the 4th iteration is approximately 94.8147 cm."
