    "message_1": "A wheel has a diameter of 50cm, what is its circumference?",
    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π × Diameter (D)\n\nGiven that the diameter (D) of the wheel is 50 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π × 50 cm\n\nUsing the value of π (approximately 3.14159):\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 × 50 cm\nC ≈ 157.0795 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the wheel is approximately 157.08 cm."
