    "message_2": "To find the vertex and axis of symmetry of the quadratic equation y = 2(x-3)^2 + 5, we first need to identify the vertex form of a quadratic equation, which is given by:\n\ny = a(x-h)^2 + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola and a determines the direction and shape of the parabola.\n\nComparing the given equation y = 2(x-3)^2 + 5 with the vertex form, we can see that:\n\na = 2\nh = 3\nk = 5\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (h, k) = (3, 5).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex of the parabola. It has the equation x = h. In this case, the axis of symmetry is:\n\nx = 3"
