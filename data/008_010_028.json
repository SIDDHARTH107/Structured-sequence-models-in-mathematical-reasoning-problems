    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n|  2  3 -1 | 10\n|  4 -2  2 | -2\n| -2  1 -2 |  2\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  1.5 -0.5 |  5\n|  4 -2   2   | -2\n| -2  1  -2   |  2\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the leading 1 by adding/subtracting multiples of the first row:\n\nAdd -4 times the first row to the second row:\n\n|  1  1.5 -0.5 |  5\n|  0 -8   4   | -22\n| -2  1  -2   |  2\n\nAdd 2 times the first row to the third row:\n\n|  1  1.5 -0.5 |  5\n|  0 -8   4   | -22\n|  0  4  -3   | 12\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -8 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n|  1  1.5 -0.5 |  5\n|  0  1  -0.5 |  2.75\n|  0  4  -3   | 12\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below and above the leading 1 in the second row:\n\nAdd -1.5 times the second row to the first row:\n\n|  1  0   0.25 |  0.875\n|  0  1  -0.5 |  2.75\n|  0  4  -3   | 12\n\nAdd -4 times the second row to the third row:\n\n|  1  0   0.25 |  0.875\n|  0  1  -0.5 |  2.75\n|  0  0   1   |  1\n\nNow we have the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n|  1  0   0.25 |  0.875\n|  0  1  -0.5 |  2.75\n|  0  0   1   |  1\n\nStep 5: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 1.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - 0.5z = 2.75, so y = 2.75 + 0.5(1) = 3.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + 0.25z = 0.875, so x = 0.875 - 0.25(1) = 0.625.\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0.625, y = 3, and z = 1."
