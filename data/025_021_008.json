    "message_1": "A mirror symmetry problem:\n\nLet $X$ be a Calabi-Yau threefold with Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}(X) = 3$ and $h^{2,1}(X) = 243$. Consider its mirror partner $Y$ and let $a$ be the coefficient of the term $q^{50}$ in the formal power series expansion of the Gromov-Witten invariants of $Y$. What is the value of $a$?",
    "message_2": "To find the value of $a$, we will use the mirror symmetry relationship between the Gromov-Witten invariants of $Y$ and the periods of the holomorphic 3-form on $X$. \n\nAccording to mirror symmetry, the generating function of Gromov-Witten invariants of $Y$ is given by the Yukawa coupling of $X$, which is a function of the periods of the holomorphic 3-form on $X$. The Yukawa coupling can be computed from the prepotential $F$ of $X$, which is a function of the complexified Kähler moduli $t_i$ of $X$. The prepotential $F$ is given by the following formula:\n\n$$F = \\frac{1}{6} C_{ijk} t^i t^j t^k$$\n\nwhere $C_{ijk}$ are the triple intersection numbers of $X$. Since $h^{1,1}(X) = 3$, there are three complexified Kähler moduli $t_1, t_2, t_3$. The Yukawa coupling is given by the second derivative of the prepotential with respect to the moduli:\n\n$$Y_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial^3 F}{\\partial t^i \\partial t^j \\partial t^k} = C_{ijk}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between the periods of the holomorphic 3-form on $X$ and the complexified Kähler moduli $t_i$. This relationship is given by the Picard-Fuchs equations, which are a system of linear differential equations satisfied by the periods. The solutions to the Picard-Fuchs equations can be expressed as power series in the mirror map variable $q$. \n\nThe coefficient $a$ of the term $q^{50}$ in the formal power series expansion of the Gromov-Witten invariants of $Y$ is related to the periods of the holomorphic 3-form on $X$ by the mirror map. To compute the value of $a$, we need to solve the Picard-Fuchs equations for the periods and find the corresponding term in the power series expansion of the Yukawa coupling.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ and its mirror partner $Y$, it is not possible to compute the value of $a$. The value of $a$ depends on the specific geometry of $X$ and the corresponding mirror map between $X$ and $Y$."
