    "message_1": "A used car dealer specializing in luxury cars offers a warranty on all cars sold. The warranty costs the dealer $500 for each car sold. He knows that 10% of the cars he sells will need a repair that will cost $2000, and 90% of the cars he sells will not need any repairs covered under the warranty. Suppose that the dealer offers the warranty for $1000. \n\nWhat is the probability that a buyer who purchases the warranty will end up needing a repair covered under the warranty? Is it financially viable for the dealer to offer the warranty given this information? Show your calculations.",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the probability that a buyer who purchases the warranty will end up needing a repair covered under the warranty. We know that 10% of the cars sold will need a repair that costs $2000. So, the probability of needing a repair is 0.10 or 10%.\n\nNow, let's analyze the financial viability of offering the warranty for the dealer. We'll calculate the expected profit for the dealer per car sold with a warranty.\n\nExpected Profit = (Probability of needing repair * (Warranty Price - Repair Cost)) + (Probability of not needing repair * Warranty Price) - Warranty Cost\n\nExpected Profit = (0.10 * ($1000 - $2000)) + (0.90 * $1000) - $500\nExpected Profit = (0.10 * -$1000) + (0.90 * $1000) - $500\nExpected Profit = -$100 + $900 - $500\nExpected Profit = $300\n\nSince the expected profit per car sold with a warranty is $300, it is financially viable for the dealer to offer the warranty at $1000."
