    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Catalan numbers:\n\nAlice wants to build a tower using blocks of two different colors: red and blue. She has 8 red blocks and 5 blue blocks. If she wants to build a tower that has exactly 6 blocks and starts with a red block, how many different towers can she build?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use combinations. Since Alice wants to build a tower with 6 blocks and it must start with a red block, we can break down the problem into two cases:\n\nCase 1: The tower has 5 red blocks and 1 blue block.\nCase 2: The tower has 4 red blocks and 2 blue blocks.\n\nFor Case 1, there are 5 remaining spots for the 1 blue block. So there is only 1 way to choose the position for the blue block, which is C(5,1) = 5.\n\nFor Case 2, there are 5 remaining spots for the 2 blue blocks. We can use combinations to find the number of ways to choose the positions for the blue blocks, which is C(5,2) = 10.\n\nAdding the possibilities from both cases, we get a total of 5 + 10 = 15 different towers that Alice can build."
