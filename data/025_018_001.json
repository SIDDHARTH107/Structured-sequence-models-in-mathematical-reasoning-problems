    "message_2": "To compute the self-intersection number L^2 on X, we can use the adjunction formula and the fact that the canonical divisor K_X is given by the formula K_X = (n-1)L, where n is the degree of the hypersurface.\n\nIn our case, X is defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0, which is a cubic hypersurface in P^2. Thus, the degree n = 3. Using the formula for the canonical divisor, we have K_X = (3-1)L = 2L.\n\nNow, we can use the adjunction formula, which states that (K_X + L)^2 = deg(X) * L^2. In our case, deg(X) = 3. Substituting K_X = 2L, we get:\n\n(2L + L)^2 = 3 * L^2\n(3L)^2 = 3 * L^2\n9L^2 = 3 * L^2\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we obtain:\n\nL^2 = 3\n\nSo, the self-intersection number L^2 on X is equal to 3."
