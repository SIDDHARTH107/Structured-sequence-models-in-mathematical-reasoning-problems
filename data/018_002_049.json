A ∩ B is the set of elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B.\n\nFor A:\n4 ∈ A, 6 ∈ A, and 8 ∈ A. So, all elements of A ∩ B are elements of A.\n\nFor B:\n4 ∈ B, 6 ∈ B, and 8 ∈ B. So, all elements of A ∩ B are elements of B.\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of each of the sets A and B."
