    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the natural frequency and damping ratio of the RLC circuit. Then, we will find the current equation for the circuit.\n\n1. Natural frequency (ωn):\n\nThe natural frequency of an RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nωn = 1 / √(LC)\n\nwhere L is the inductance and C is the capacitance.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nωn = 1 / √(2 H * 0.001 F) = 1 / √(0.002) = 1 / 0.0447 ≈ 22.36 rad/s\n\n2. Damping ratio (ζ):\n\nThe damping ratio of an RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nζ = R / (2 * √(L/C))\n\nwhere R is the resistance, L is the inductance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nζ = 10 ohms / (2 * √(2 H / 0.001 F)) = 10 / (2 * √(2000)) = 10 / (2 * 44.7) ≈ 0.112\n\n3. Current equation (i(t)):\n\nThe current equation for an underdamped RLC circuit (ζ < 1) is given by the formula:\n\ni(t) = e^(-ζωn * t) * [A * sin(ωd * t) + B * cos(ωd * t)]\n\nwhere ωd is the damped angular frequency, given by:\n\nωd = ωn * √(1 - ζ^2)\n\nInitial conditions are:\ni(0) = 4 A (initial current)\nq(0) = 0 C (initial charge on the capacitor)\n\nTo find A and B, we will use the initial conditions. First, let's find ωd:\n\nωd = 22.36 * √(1 - 0.112^2) ≈ 22.17 rad/s\n\nNow, using the initial current condition i(0) = 4 A:\n\n4 = e^(-0.112 * 22.36 * 0) * [A * sin(22.17 * 0) + B * cos(22.17 * 0)]\n\n4 = [A * 0 + B * 1]\n\nB = 4\n\nNext, we will use the initial charge condition q(0) = 0 C. The charge on the capacitor is given by the integral of the current:\n\nq(t) = ∫i(t) dt\n\nIntegrating i(t) with respect to t, we get:\n\nq(t) = e^(-ζωn * t) * [C1 * sin(ωd * t) + C2 * cos(ωd * t)]\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are constants.\n\nUsing the initial charge condition q(0) = 0 C:\n\n0 = e^(-0.112 * 22.36 * 0) * [C1 * sin(22.17 * 0) + C2 * cos(22.17 * 0)]\n\n0 = [C1 * 0 + C2 * 1]\n\nC2 = 0\n\nNow, we can find C1 by differentiating q(t) with respect to t and using the initial current condition i(0) = 4 A:\n\ndq(t)/dt = i(t) = e^(-ζωn * t) * [C1 * ωd * cos(ωd * t) - C2 * ζωn * sin(ωd * t)]\n\n4 = e^(-0.112 * 22.36 * 0) * [C1 * 22.17 * cos(22.17 * 0) - 0]\n\n4 = [C1 * 22.17]\n\nC1 = 4 / 22.17 ≈ 0.180\n\nFinally, we can write the current equation i(t):\n\ni(t) = e^(-0.112 * 22.36 * t) * [0.180 * sin(22.17 * t) + 4 * cos(22.17 * t)]\n\nSo, the natural frequency is approximately 22.36 rad/s, the damping ratio is approximately 0.112, and the current equation is:\n\ni(t) ≈ e^(-2.5t) * [0.180 * sin(22.17 * t) + 4 * cos(22.17 * t)] A"
