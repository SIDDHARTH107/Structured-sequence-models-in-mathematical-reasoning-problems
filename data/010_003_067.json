    "message_2": "Let's first recall some basic definitions and properties of topological spaces:\n\n1. A topological space X is a set equipped with a collection of open sets that satisfy the following axioms:\n   a. The empty set and X itself are open.\n   b. The intersection of finitely many open sets is open.\n   c. The union of any collection of open sets is open.\n\n2. A closed set is the complement of an open set. That is, if A is an open set in X, then X \\ A is a closed set.\n\n3. The number of closed sets in a topological space is equal to the number of open sets, since each open set has a unique closed set as its complement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given problem:\n\nWe are given that X has exactly 5 open sets, and one of them is X itself. Since the empty set is always open, we have 3 more open sets to consider. Let's denote these open sets as A, B, and C.\n\nSince every two distinct points in X can be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods, we know that A, B, and C must be pairwise disjoint (i.e., A ∩ B = A ∩ C = B ∩ C = ∅).\n\nNow, let's find the closed sets corresponding to each open set:\n\n1. The complement of X is the empty set, which is closed.\n2. The complement of the empty set is X, which is closed.\n3. The complement of A is X \\ A, which is closed.\n4. The complement of B is X \\ B, which is closed.\n5. The complement of C is X \\ C, which is closed.\n\nThus, we have found 5 closed sets corresponding to the 5 open sets. Since the number of closed sets is equal to the number of open sets, the maximum number of closed sets that X can have is 5."
