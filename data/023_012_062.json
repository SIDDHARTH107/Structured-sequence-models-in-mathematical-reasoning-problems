    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x), we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients. To find b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nx) dx) from -π to π\n\nFor the given piecewise function, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(0 * sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(2 * sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nThe first integral evaluates to zero since it's multiplied by 0. Now we only need to solve the second integral:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫(sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π\n\nIntegrating sin(nx) with respect to x, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-cos(nx)/n] from 0 to π\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-cos(nπ)/n + cos(0)/n] = (2/π) * [-cos(nπ)/n + 1/n]\n\nNow we have the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2/π) * (-cos(nπ)/n + 1/n) * sin(nx)]\n\nNow, we want to find the Fourier series representation of g(x) = f(x) - x. Since the Fourier series is linear, we can simply subtract x from the f(x) Fourier series:\n\ng(x) = f(x) - x = Σ[(2/π) * (-cos(nπ)/n + 1/n) * sin(nx)] - x\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of g(x) = f(x) - x."
