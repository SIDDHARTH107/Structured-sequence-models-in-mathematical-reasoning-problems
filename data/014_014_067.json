    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"ALGORITHMS\" using the Playfair cipher with the key phrase \"MATHEMATICS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key phrase followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is replaced by I in the Playfair cipher). Remove any duplicate letters from the key phrase.\n\nKey phrase without duplicates: MATHETICS\nRemaining alphabet: BDFGJKLMNOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nThe 5x5 grid looks like this:\n\nM A T H E\nT I C S B\nD F G K L\nN O P Q R\nU V W X Y Z\n\n2. Split the message into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter twice, insert an 'X' between them and continue pairing. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\nAL GO RX IT HM SX\n\n3. For each pair of letters, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if needed).\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if needed).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\nEncrypted pairs:\nAL -> RM\nGO -> KQ\nRX -> YC\nIT -> CE\nHM -> AT\nSX -> YB\n\n4. Combine the encrypted pairs to get the final encrypted message:\n\nRMKQYCCATYB"
