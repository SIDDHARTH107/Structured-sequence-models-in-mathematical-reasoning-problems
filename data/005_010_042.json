    "message_1": "A newly constructed bridge has a weight limit of 18,000 pounds. The weight of trucks crossing this bridge follows a normal distribution with a mean of 16,500 pounds and a standard deviation of 1,200 pounds. \n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected truck with weight greater than 18,000 pounds will be allowed to cross the bridge according to Bayesian statistics?",
    "message_2": "The problem statement seems to have a contradiction. If a truck has a weight greater than 18,000 pounds, it should not be allowed to cross the bridge according to the weight limit. However, I can help you find the probability that a randomly selected truck will have a weight greater than 18,000 pounds using the given normal distribution.\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected truck will have a weight greater than 18,000 pounds, we can use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the weight of the truck, μ is the mean weight, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor this problem, X = 18,000 pounds, μ = 16,500 pounds, and σ = 1,200 pounds. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (18,000 - 16,500) / 1,200 = 1,500 / 1,200 = 1.25\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected truck will have a z-score greater than 1.25. We can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the area to the right of z = 1.25. \n\nUsing a z-table or an online calculator, we find that the area to the right of z = 1.25 is approximately 0.211.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected truck will have a weight greater than 18,000 pounds is approximately 21.1%."
