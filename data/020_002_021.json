    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize its profit by producing two types of products: Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time per unit, while the production of Product B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time per unit. The company has 100 hours of labor and 120 hours of machine time available per day. \n\nThe profit per unit for Product A is $10 and for Product B is $15. How many units of each product must the company produce daily to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n2x + y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 120 (machine time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first solve the system of inequalities graphically by finding the feasible region and then finding the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the inequalities as equations:\n\n2x + y = 100\nx + 3y = 120\n\nNow, we will find the points where these lines intersect the axes:\n\nFor the labor constraint (2x + y = 100):\n- If x = 0, y = 100\n- If y = 0, x = 50\n\nFor the machine time constraint (x + 3y = 120):\n- If x = 0, y = 40\n- If y = 0, x = 120\n\nNow, we will find the intersection point of these two lines:\n\n2x + y = 100\nx + 3y = 120\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n2y = 20\ny = 10\n\nSubstituting y back into the first equation:\n\n2x + 10 = 100\n2x = 90\nx = 45\n\nSo, the intersection point is (45, 10).\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (0, 40)\n3. (50, 0)\n4. (45, 10)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 15(40) = $600\n3. P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 15(0) = $500\n4. P(45, 10) = 10(45) + 15(10) = $600\n\nThe maximum profit is $600, which occurs at two vertices: (0, 40) and (45, 10).\n\nTherefore, the company can either produce 40 units of Product B and no units of Product A or produce 45 units of Product A and 10 units of Product B to maximize its profit at $600 per day."
