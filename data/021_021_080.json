    "message_1": "A factory produces t-shirts and hoodies in two sizes, small and medium. The cost of producing a small t-shirt is $8 and the cost of producing a medium t-shirt is $10. The cost of producing a small hoodie is $12 and the cost of producing a medium hoodie is $15. Additionally, the factory has a production capacity of 400 units per week. If the factory wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each size/product combination (small t-shirt, medium t-shirt, small hoodie, medium hoodie) should it produce? Use the cuckoo search algorithm to solve this optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm. Let's denote the number of small t-shirts, medium t-shirts, small hoodies, and medium hoodies as x1, x2, x3, and x4, respectively.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nAssuming the selling prices for small t-shirts, medium t-shirts, small hoodies, and medium hoodies are p1, p2, p3, and p4, respectively, the profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit = (p1 - 8)x1 + (p2 - 10)x2 + (p3 - 12)x3 + (p4 - 15)x4\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production capacity constraint: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 <= 400\n2. Non-negativity constraint: x1, x2, x3, x4 >= 0\n\nCuckoo search algorithm parameters:\n- Number of nests (n): This is the number of potential solutions in the population.\n- Discovery rate (P_a): This is the probability of a cuckoo laying its eggs in another nest.\n- Step size (α): This controls the step size of the random walk during the search process.\n\nNow, we can apply the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal number of each product to maximize profit:\n\n1. Initialize a population of n nests (solutions) with random values for x1, x2, x3, and x4, satisfying the constraints.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each nest.\n3. Choose a random nest and generate a new solution by performing a random walk with step size α.\n4. If the new solution has a better fitness, replace the original nest with the new solution.\n5. With probability P_a, choose a random nest and replace it with a new solution generated by a random walk with step size α.\n6. Evaluate the fitness of the new nests.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of convergence).\n\nAfter the algorithm converges, the nest with the highest fitness (profit) will provide the optimal number of small t-shirts (x1), medium t-shirts (x2), small hoodies (x3), and medium hoodies (x4) to produce to maximize profit. Note that the selling prices (p1, p2, p3, and p4) must be provided to calculate the actual profit."
