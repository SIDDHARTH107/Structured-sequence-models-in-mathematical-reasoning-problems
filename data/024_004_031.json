    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, -1, 0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface by setting x = u and y = v. Then, the parameterization is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 0\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\ne = r_uu • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nf = r_uv • N = 0\ng = r_vv • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface, given by the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v / ||r_u × r_v||\n\nNow, we can compute the mean curvature H using the formula:\n\nH = (eG + gE - 2fF) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nSubstituting the values of the coefficients, we get:\n\nH = (2(1 + 4v^2) - 2(1 + 4u^2)) / (2((1 + 4u^2)(1 + 4v^2)))\n\nNow, we evaluate H at the point (1, -1, 0), which corresponds to (u, v) = (1, -1):\n\nH = (2(1 + 4(-1)^2) - 2(1 + 4(1)^2)) / (2((1 + 4(1)^2)(1 + 4(-1)^2)))\nH = (2(1 + 4) - 2(1 + 16)) / (2((1 + 16)(1 + 4)))\nH = (12 - 34) / (2(17)(5))\nH = -22 / 170\n\nHence, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, -1, 0) is:\n\nH = -11/85"
