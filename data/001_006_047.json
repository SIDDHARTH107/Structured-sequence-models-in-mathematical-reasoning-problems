    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a quadratic equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = 2x^2 + 4x - 6\n\nNow, we can try to solve this equation by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, the quadratic formula is the most straightforward method.\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nFor our equation, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(2)(-6))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 48)) / 4\n\nx = (-4 ± √64) / 4\n\nx = (-4 ± 8) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-4 + 8) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nx = (-4 - 8) / 4 = -12 / 4 = -3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 4x - 6 are x = 1 and x = -3."
