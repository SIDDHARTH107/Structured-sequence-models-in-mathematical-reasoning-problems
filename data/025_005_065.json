    "message_1": "Consider the algebraic variety V given by the equation $y^2=x^3+6x^2+5x$.\n\nWhat is the number of singular points on the curve V?",
    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the curve V, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 6x^2 - 5x$. Then the partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 12x - 5$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nA singular point occurs when both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$-3x^2 - 12x - 5 = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now we need to solve the first equation for x:\n\n$-3x^2 - 12x - 5 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for x:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-12) \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(-3)(-5)}}{2(-3)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 60}}{-6}$\n\n$x = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{84}}{-6}$\n\nThe two solutions for x are:\n\n$x_1 = \\frac{12 + \\sqrt{84}}{-6}$\n\n$x_2 = \\frac{12 - \\sqrt{84}}{-6}$\n\nSo, there are two singular points on the curve V:\n\n$(x_1, 0) = \\left(\\frac{12 + \\sqrt{84}}{-6}, 0\\right)$\n\n$(x_2, 0) = \\left(\\frac{12 - \\sqrt{84}}{-6}, 0\\right)$"
