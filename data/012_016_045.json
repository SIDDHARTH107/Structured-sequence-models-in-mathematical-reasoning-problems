    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G with 5 vertices and 7 edges, we first need to know the structure of the graph. However, since the structure of the graph is not provided, we can only provide a general formula for the Tutte polynomial.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) of a graph G is defined recursively as follows:\n\n1. If G has no edges, then T_G(x, y) = x^(number of isolated vertices) * y^(number of connected components with at least one vertex).\n2. If G has an edge e that is neither a bridge nor a loop, then T_G(x, y) = T_(G-e)(x, y) + T_(G/e)(x, y), where G-e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n3. If G has a loop e, then T_G(x, y) = x * T_(G-e)(x, y).\n4. If G has a bridge e, then T_G(x, y) = y * T_(G/e)(x, y).\n\nSince we don't know the structure of the graph, we cannot compute the Tutte polynomial directly. However, you can use the above recursive formula to compute the Tutte polynomial for any specific graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges."
