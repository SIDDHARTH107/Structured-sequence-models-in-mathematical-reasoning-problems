    "message_2": "To find the output y(t) of the system, we need to compute the convolution of the input signal x(t) and the impulse response h(t). In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to multiplying their Fourier transforms and then taking the inverse Fourier transform of the result.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t). Since h(t) = e^(-2t)u(t), its Fourier transform H(f) can be found using the standard Fourier transform table:\n\nH(f) = 1/(2 + j2πf)\n\nNow, we can find the product of the Fourier transforms X(f) and H(f):\n\nY(f) = X(f) * H(f) = (4/(j2πf + 1)) * (1/(2 + j2πf))\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(f) to obtain y(t). To do this, we can use partial fraction decomposition to rewrite Y(f) as a sum of simpler terms:\n\nY(f) = A/(j2πf + 1) + B/(2 + j2πf)\n\nSolving for A and B, we get:\n\nA = 2 and B = 2\n\nSo, Y(f) = 2/(j2πf + 1) + 2/(2 + j2πf)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of each term:\n\ny(t) = 2 * inverse_Fourier_transform{1/(j2πf + 1)} + 2 * inverse_Fourier_transform{1/(2 + j2πf)}\n\nUsing the standard Fourier transform table, we find:\n\ny(t) = 2 * e^(-t)u(t) + 2 * e^(-2t)u(t)\n\nSo, the output y(t) of the system is:\n\ny(t) = 2 * e^(-t)u(t) + 2 * e^(-2t)u(t)"
