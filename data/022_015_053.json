Using the Schwarz reflection principle, find an explicit formula for $f(z)$ if it is reflected across the real axis to the lower half of the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "To find the explicit formula for $f(z)$ when it is reflected across the real axis to the lower half of the complex plane, we will use the Schwarz reflection principle. The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in the upper half-plane and continuous on the real axis, then its reflection across the real axis is given by:\n\n$$f(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{f(z)}$$\n\nwhere $\\overline{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z$.\n\nIn our case, $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z+1}$. To find the reflection of $f(z)$ across the real axis, we first find the complex conjugate of $z$, which is $\\overline{z}$. Then, we substitute $\\overline{z}$ into the function and find the complex conjugate of the result.\n\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then, the complex conjugate of $z$ is $\\overline{z} = x - yi$. Now, we substitute $\\overline{z}$ into the function:\n\n$$f(\\overline{z}) = \\frac{1}{\\overline{z} + 1} = \\frac{1}{(x - yi) + 1} = \\frac{1}{x + 1 - yi}$$\n\nNow, we find the complex conjugate of the result:\n\n$$\\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = \\overline{\\frac{1}{x + 1 - yi}}$$\n\nTo find the complex conjugate of a fraction, we can conjugate both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n$$\\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = \\frac{\\overline{1}}{\\overline{x + 1 - yi}} = \\frac{1}{x + 1 + yi}$$\n\nSo, the explicit formula for $f(z)$ when it is reflected across the real axis to the lower half of the complex plane is:\n\n$$f(\\overline{z}) = \\frac{1}{x + 1 + yi}$$"
