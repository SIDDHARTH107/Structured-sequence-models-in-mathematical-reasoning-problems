    "message_2": "First, let's find the derivative f'(x) using the centered difference formula of order O(h^2). The formula is:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)\n\nLet x = pi/4 and h = pi/8. Then:\n\nf'(pi/4) ≈ (f(pi/4 + pi/8) - f(pi/4 - pi/8)) / (2 * pi/8)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of f(x) at these points:\n\nf(pi/4 + pi/8) = sin(3pi/8)\nf(pi/4 - pi/8) = sin(pi/8)\n\nSo, the derivative is:\n\nf'(pi/4) ≈ (sin(3pi/8) - sin(pi/8)) / (pi/4)\n\nNow, let's approximate the definite integral of f(x) from x = 0 to x = pi/4 using the trapezoidal rule with a step size of h = pi/8. The formula for the trapezoidal rule is:\n\n∫(f(x)) ≈ h * (f(x0)/2 + f(x1) + ... + f(xn-1) + f(xn)/2)\n\nHere, x0 = 0, x1 = pi/8, and x2 = pi/4. So, we have:\n\n∫(f(x)) ≈ (pi/8) * (f(0)/2 + f(pi/8) + f(pi/4)/2)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of f(x) at these points:\n\nf(0) = sin(0) = 0\nf(pi/8) = sin(pi/8)\nf(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the integral is:\n\n∫(f(x)) ≈ (pi/8) * (0/2 + sin(pi/8) + (1/sqrt(2))/2)\n\nNow, we have the derivative and integral approximations:\n\nf'(pi/4) ≈ (sin(3pi/8) - sin(pi/8)) / (pi/4)\n∫(f(x)) ≈ (pi/8) * (sin(pi/8) + (1/sqrt(2))/2)"
