    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)/(x^2 + 1) using the quotient rule, we first identify the numerator function as u(x) = 2x^2 + 3x and the denominator function as v(x) = x^2 + 1. \n\nThe quotient rule states that the derivative of a quotient of two functions is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (v(x) * u'(x) - u(x) * v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x)/dx = 4x + 3\nv'(x) = d(x^2 + 1)/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = ((x^2 + 1)(4x + 3) - (2x^2 + 3x)(2x)) / (x^2 + 1)^2\n\nf'(x) = ((4x^3 + 4x + 3x^2 + 3) - (4x^3 + 6x^2)) / (x^2 + 1)^2\n\nf'(x) = (4x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x + 3 - 4x^3 - 6x^2) / (x^2 + 1)^2\n\nf'(x) = (-3x^2 + 4x + 3) / (x^2 + 1)^2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = (-3x^2 + 4x + 3) / (x^2 + 1)^2"
