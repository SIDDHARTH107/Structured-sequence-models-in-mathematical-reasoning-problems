    "message_2": "To determine the order and nature of the pole of the function f(z) = (sin z) / (z^3) at z = 0, we will use the Laurent series expansion of sin z around z = 0.\n\nThe Laurent series expansion of sin z is given by:\n\nsin z = z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...\n\nNow, we can write f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (sin z) / (z^3) = (z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...) / (z^3)\n\nDividing each term by z^3, we get:\n\nf(z) = 1/z^2 - 1/3! + z^2/5! - z^4/7! + ...\n\nSince the Laurent series expansion of f(z) has a finite number of terms with negative powers of z, the function f(z) has a pole at z = 0. The order of the pole is determined by the highest power of z in the denominator, which is z^2. Therefore, the order of the pole is 2.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) = (sin z) / (z^3) has a pole of order 2 at z = 0."
