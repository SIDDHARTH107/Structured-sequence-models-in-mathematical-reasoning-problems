The symmetric difference consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A, denoted as A'. A' consists of all elements that are not in A. Since we don't have a universal set defined, we can assume that the universal set is the union of A and B, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference between (A ∆ B) and A':\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ∆ {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\nThe symmetric difference consists of elements that are in either (A ∆ B) or A', but not in both:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A' = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nSo, (A ∆ B) ∆ A' = {2, 4, 6, 8}."
