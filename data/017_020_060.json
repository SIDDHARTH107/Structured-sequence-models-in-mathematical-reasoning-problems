    "message_2": "To find the possible number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we first need to find the prime factorization of 40. We have:\n\n40 = 2^3 * 5^1\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n, which is given by:\n\nf(n) = (p_1 + 1)(p_2 + 1)...(p_k + 1)\n\nwhere p_1, p_2, ..., p_k are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of n.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nf(40) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 * 2 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 possible non-isomorphic groups of order 40. Now, let's enumerate them:\n\n1. C_40: The cyclic group of order 40.\n2. C_20 × C_2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 20 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. C_10 × C_4: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 10 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n4. C_8 × C_5: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 5.\n5. C_4 × C_2 × C_5: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4, a cyclic group of order 2, and a cyclic group of order 5.\n6. D_20: The dihedral group of order 40 (which has 20 elements of order 2 and 20 elements of order 4).\n7. Q_8 × C_5: The direct product of the quaternion group of order 8 (Q_8) and a cyclic group of order 5.\n8. C_4 × D_10: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and the dihedral group of order 20 (D_10).\n\nThese are the 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 40."
