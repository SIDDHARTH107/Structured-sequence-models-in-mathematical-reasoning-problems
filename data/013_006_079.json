    "message_1": "Suppose two hunters are out hunting deer and stag. They must choose whether to work together to hunt the stag or hunt deer individually. If they both hunt stag, they will each catch a stag and earn 10 points. If they both hunt deer, they will each earn 5 points. However, if one hunter chooses to hunt stag and the other chooses to hunt deer they will get nothing. If you were one of the hunters, what would be your strategy in this situation and why?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, the best strategy would be to communicate and cooperate with the other hunter to both hunt the stag. This is because if both hunters work together to hunt the stag, they will each earn the maximum possible points (10 points each). \n\nHowever, if there is no communication or trust between the hunters, they might both choose to hunt deer individually to avoid the risk of getting nothing. In this case, they would each earn 5 points, which is less than the 10 points they could earn by cooperating.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to establish trust and communication with the other hunter and agree to work together to hunt the stag, maximizing the points earned by both hunters."
