    "message_1": "A company has two factories, one in New York and one in California. The company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The company can produce up to 500 units of Product A per week in New York and up to 600 units of Product A per week in California. Similarly, the company can produce up to 400 units of Product B per week in New York and up to 700 units of Product B per week in California. The company needs to allocate its resources to maximize its weekly production. If the profit per unit of Product A is $10 and the profit per unit of Product B is $15, what should be the weekly production of each product in each factory to maximize the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to determine the optimal production levels of Product A and Product B in both factories. We can set up a linear programming problem to solve this.\n\nLet x1 be the number of units of Product A produced in New York, x2 be the number of units of Product A produced in California, x3 be the number of units of Product B produced in New York, and x4 be the number of units of Product B produced in California.\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize): P = 10(x1 + x2) + 15(x3 + x4)\n\nConstraints:\n1. x1 ≤ 500 (maximum Product A production in New York)\n2. x2 ≤ 600 (maximum Product A production in California)\n3. x3 ≤ 400 (maximum Product B production in New York)\n4. x4 ≤ 700 (maximum Product B production in California)\n5. x1, x2, x3, x4 ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method. For simplicity, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x1 = 500 (vertical line)\n2. x2 = 600 (horizontal line)\n3. x3 = 400 (vertical line)\n4. x4 = 700 (horizontal line)\n\nThe feasible region is a rectangle with vertices (0, 0), (500, 0), (0, 600), and (500, 600).\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0 + 0) + 15(0 + 0) = $0\n2. P(500, 0) = 10(500 + 0) + 15(0 + 0) = $5,000\n3. P(0, 600) = 10(0 + 600) + 15(0 + 0) = $6,000\n4. P(500, 600) = 10(500 + 600) + 15(0 + 0) = $11,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (500, 600), with a profit of $11,000. Therefore, the company should produce 500 units of Product A in New York, 600 units of Product A in California, and no units of Product B in either factory to maximize its weekly profit."
