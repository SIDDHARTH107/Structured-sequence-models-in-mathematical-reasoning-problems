    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A ∆ B). The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6} (since 3 and 4 are in both A and B, they are not included)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and {3, 4}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ {3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (since 3 and 4 are not in A ∆ B, they are included)\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of A and {3, 4}.\n\nA ∆ {3, 4} = {1, 2} (since 3 and 4 are in A, they are not included)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and {3, 4}.\n\nB ∆ {3, 4} = {5, 6} (since 3 and 4 are in B, they are not included)\n\nFinally, let's find the intersection of the two sets we just found: {1, 2} and {5, 6}.\n\n{1, 2} ∩ {5, 6} = ∅ (the empty set, since there are no common elements)\n\nHowever, this result is not equal to the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and {3, 4}, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Therefore, the given statement is incorrect, and the result of (A ∆ B) ∆ {3, 4} is not equal to the intersection of the symmetric differences of A and B with {3, 4}."
