    "message_2": "To determine the number of principal components needed to explain 85% of the variance in a dataset consisting of 10 variables, you would need to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset. PCA is a statistical technique that transforms the original variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The first principal component accounts for the largest possible variance in the dataset, the second principal component accounts for the second largest variance, and so on.\n\nOnce you have calculated the principal components, you can determine the proportion of variance explained by each component. To do this, you would calculate the eigenvalue for each principal component and then divide each eigenvalue by the sum of all eigenvalues. This will give you the proportion of variance explained by each component.\n\nNext, you would sort the principal components in descending order based on the proportion of variance explained. Starting with the first principal component, you would add the proportion of variance explained by each subsequent component until you reach or exceed 85%.\n\nThe number of principal components needed to reach or exceed 85% of the variance explained will depend on the specific dataset. Without the actual dataset, it is not possible to provide an exact number of principal components needed."
