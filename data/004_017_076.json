However, we can approximate the value of the integral using numerical methods, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integration calculator.\n\nUsing a numerical integration calculator, we find that:\n\nL ≈ 9.091\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^2 between the points x = 1 and x = 3 is approximately 9.091 units."
