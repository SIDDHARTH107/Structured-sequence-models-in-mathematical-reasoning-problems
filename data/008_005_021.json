    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using the non-homogeneous method, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  6 |\n| 2 -3  1 | -2 |\n| 3 -2  2 | 11 |\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times Row 1 from Row 2:\n| 1  2 -1 |  6  |\n| 0 -7  3 | -14 |\n| 3 -2  2 | 11  |\n\n2. Subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 3:\n| 1  2 -1 |  6  |\n| 0 -7  3 | -14 |\n| 0 -8  5 | -7  |\n\n3. Multiply Row 2 by -1/7:\n| 1  2 -1 |  6  |\n| 0  1 -3/7|  2  |\n| 0 -8  5 | -7  |\n\n4. Add 8 times Row 2 to Row 3:\n| 1  2 -1 |  6  |\n| 0  1 -3/7|  2  |\n| 0  0  1 |  9  |\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 9.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - (3/7)z = 2, so y = 2 + (3/7)(9) = 2 + 27/7 = 41/7.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + 2y - z = 6, so x = 6 - 2(41/7) + 9 = (6 - 82/7 + 63/7) = 13/7.\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of equations is x = 13/7, y = 41/7, and z = 9."
