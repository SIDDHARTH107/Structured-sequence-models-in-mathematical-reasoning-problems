    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature (K) over a closed surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface:\n\n∫K dA = 2πχ\n\nGiven that the curvature is 2 cm^-1 at each point, we can find the Gaussian curvature (K) for the sphere. The Gaussian curvature of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere. In this case, R = 5 cm. So,\n\nK = 1/(5^2) = 1/25 cm^-2\n\nSince the curvature is 2 cm^-1 at each point, we can equate the given curvature with the Gaussian curvature:\n\n2 cm^-1 = 1/25 cm^-2\n\nNow, we need to find the surface area (A) of the sphere:\n\nA = 4πR^2 = 4π(5^2) = 100π cm^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the surface area:\n\n∫K dA = (1/25 cm^-2) * (100π cm^2) = 4π\n\nAccording to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n∫K dA = 2πχ\n\nSo, we have:\n\n4π = 2πχ\n\nDivide both sides by 2π:\n\nχ = 2\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic of the closed sphere with a radius of 5 cm is 2."
