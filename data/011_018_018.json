    "message_1": "Consider a block design B(7,3,2) where there are 7 treatments, and each block contains 3 treatments. If each pair of treatments appears together in exactly 2 blocks, how many blocks are there in total?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the following formula for block designs:\n\nr * (v - 1) = k * (b - 1)\n\nwhere:\n- v is the number of treatments (7 in this case)\n- b is the number of blocks\n- r is the number of times each treatment appears in the blocks\n- k is the number of times each pair of treatments appears together in the blocks\n\nWe are given v = 7, k = 2, and we need to find b. To find r, we can use the formula:\n\nr = k * (v - 1) / (k - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nr = 2 * (7 - 1) / (2 - 1)\nr = 2 * 6 / 1\nr = 12\n\nNow we can use the formula for block designs to find b:\n\n12 * (7 - 1) = 2 * (b - 1)\n72 = 2 * (b - 1)\n36 = b - 1\nb = 37\n\nSo there are 37 blocks in total."
