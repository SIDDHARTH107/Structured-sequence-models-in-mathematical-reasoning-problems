    "message_1": "The following ciphertext has been encrypted using a substitution cipher (letters of the alphabet have been replaced with other letters). Use frequency analysis to determine the plaintext message: \n\nEHXBSAKL TIWWAGLPMPQUFMDJOREVUYCNZ\n\nHow many times does the letter \"P\" appear in the plaintext message?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first perform frequency analysis on the given ciphertext. Here's the frequency of each letter in the ciphertext:\n\nE: 3, H: 1, X: 1, B: 1, S: 1, A: 2, K: 1, L: 3, T: 1, I: 1, W: 2, G: 1, P: 3, M: 2, Q: 1, U: 2, F: 1, D: 1, J: 1, O: 1, R: 1, V: 1, Y: 1, C: 1, N: 1, Z: 1\n\nNow, let's compare this to the frequency of letters in the English language (rounded to the nearest whole number):\n\nE: 12, T: 9, A: 8, O: 8, I: 7, N: 7, S: 6, H: 6, R: 6, D: 4, L: 4, U: 3, C: 3, M: 3, W: 2, F: 2, G: 2, Y: 2, P: 2, B: 1, V: 1, K: 1, J: 1, X: 1, Q: 1, Z: 1\n\nWe can make some educated guesses based on the frequency analysis. For example, \"E\" appears 3 times in the ciphertext, so it could correspond to \"H\" or \"R\" in the plaintext. Similarly, \"L\" appears 3 times in the ciphertext, so it could correspond to \"D\" or \"L\" in the plaintext. However, without more information or context, it's impossible to determine the exact plaintext message and the number of times the letter \"P\" appears in it."
