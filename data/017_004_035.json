    "message_2": "A group of order 25 has 25 elements. Since 25 is a prime number squared (25 = 5^2), there are two possible group structures for a group of order 25, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group: The group can be a cyclic group, denoted by C_25 or Z_25. In this case, there is a single generator element that generates the entire group through its powers. The group operation is usually addition modulo 25.\n\n2. Direct product of two smaller cyclic groups: The group can be the direct product of two smaller cyclic groups of order 5, denoted by C_5 × C_5 or Z_5 × Z_5. In this case, the group has two generators, and the group operation is component-wise addition modulo 5.\n\nBoth of these structures are abelian, meaning that the group operation is commutative."
