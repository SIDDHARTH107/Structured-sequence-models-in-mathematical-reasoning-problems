    "message_2": "(a) The second-order differential equation that describes the behavior of an RLC circuit is given by:\n\nL * (d^2q/dt^2) + R * (dq/dt) + (1/C) * q = V * sin(2 * pi * f * t)\n\nwhere L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, q is the charge stored in the capacitor, and V and f are the amplitude and frequency of the alternating current source, respectively.\n\nFor this problem, we have L = 0.5 H, R = 50 ohms, C = 0.1 * 10^(-6) F, V = 110 V, and f = 50 Hz. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n0.5 * (d^2q/dt^2) + 50 * (dq/dt) + (1/(0.1 * 10^(-6))) * q = 110 * sin(2 * pi * 50 * t)\n\n(b) To find the general solution of the differential equation, we first need to find the complementary function and the particular integral. The complementary function is the solution of the homogeneous equation:\n\n0.5 * (d^2q/dt^2) + 50 * (dq/dt) + (1/(0.1 * 10^(-6))) * q = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\n0.5 * m^2 + 50 * m + (1/(0.1 * 10^(-6))) = 0\n\nSolving for m, we get two complex roots:\n\nm1 = -50 + j * 100\nm2 = -50 - j * 100\n\nThe complementary function is then given by:\n\nq_c(t) = A * e^(-50t) * cos(100t) + B * e^(-50t) * sin(100t)\n\nNow, we need to find the particular integral. Since the forcing function is sinusoidal, we assume a particular integral of the form:\n\nq_p(t) = C * cos(2 * pi * 50 * t) + D * sin(2 * pi * 50 * t)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives of q_p(t) and plugging them into the original differential equation, we can solve for C and D. After solving, we get:\n\nC = 0.000176 V and D = -0.000088 V\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary function and the particular integral:\n\nq(t) = A * e^(-50t) * cos(100t) + B * e^(-50t) * sin(100t) + 0.000176 * cos(2 * pi * 50 * t) - 0.000088 * sin(2 * pi * 50 * t)\n\n(c) To determine the specific solution, we need to apply the initial conditions: i(0) = 0 and q(0) = 2 * 10^(-6) C. The current i(t) is the derivative of the charge q(t):\n\ni(t) = dq/dt\n\nApplying the initial conditions and solving for A and B, we get:\n\nA = 2 * 10^(-6) C and B = 0.000088 V / 50\n\nThe specific solution is then:\n\nq(t) = 2 * 10^(-6) * e^(-50t) * cos(100t) + (0.000088/50) * e^(-50t) * sin(100t) + 0.000176 * cos(2 * pi * 50 * t) - 0.000088 * sin(2 * pi * 50 * t)\n\n(d) To sketch the graphs of i(t) and q(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 0.1 seconds, you can use a graphing calculator or software like Desmos or Wolfram Alpha. The graphs will show oscillatory behavior with an exponentially decaying envelope due to the presence of the complementary function. The particular integral will cause the oscillations to have a frequency of 50 Hz, which is the frequency of the alternating current source."
