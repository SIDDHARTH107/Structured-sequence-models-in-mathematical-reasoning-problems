    "message_2": "Since the function $f(z) = kz^3 - 4z - 3$ is a polynomial, it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane, including at $z = 1+2i$. Therefore, there is no need to find a specific value for the constant $k$ to make the function analytic at that point. The function is already analytic for any value of $k$."
