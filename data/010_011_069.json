    "message_2": "To prove that M is homeomorphic to the connected sum of tori whose number is equal to |χ(M)|, we will use the classification theorem for compact surfaces. The classification theorem states that every compact connected 2-manifold is homeomorphic to either a sphere, a connected sum of tori, or a connected sum of projective planes.\n\nSince M has Euler characteristic -1, it cannot be homeomorphic to a sphere, as the Euler characteristic of a sphere is 2. Also, M cannot be homeomorphic to a connected sum of projective planes, as the Euler characteristic of a projective plane is 1, and the Euler characteristic of a connected sum of projective planes is always even.\n\nThus, M must be homeomorphic to a connected sum of tori. The Euler characteristic of a torus is 0, and the Euler characteristic of a connected sum of tori is the sum of the Euler characteristics of the individual tori minus 2 for each connected sum operation. Let n be the number of tori in the connected sum. Then, we have:\n\nχ(M) = n * χ(T) - 2(n - 1) = -1\n\nwhere χ(T) is the Euler characteristic of a torus, which is 0. This simplifies to:\n\n-1 = -2(n - 1)\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn = 1\n\nSo, M is homeomorphic to the connected sum of 1 torus, which is just a torus itself.\n\nNow, given that M is oriented and admits a Riemannian metric of constant Gaussian curvature -1, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact oriented Riemannian 2-manifold M with constant Gaussian curvature K, we have:\n\n∫∫_M K dA = 2πχ(M)\n\nSince M has constant Gaussian curvature -1, we have:\n\n∫∫_M (-1) dA = 2πχ(M)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-Area(M) = 2π(-1)\n\nThus, the area of M is 2π. Since M is homeomorphic to a torus, there is only 1 torus in the connected sum."
