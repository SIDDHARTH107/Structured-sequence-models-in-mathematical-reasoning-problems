    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x*cos(x) in the interval [0, 2π] using the Tabu search algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function, f(x) = x*cos(x), and the search space [0, 2π].\n2. Set the initial solution, x0, to a random value within the search space.\n3. Set the Tabu list size and the maximum number of iterations.\n4. Initialize the best solution found so far, x_best, to x0.\n5. For each iteration:\n   a. Generate a set of neighboring solutions, N(x), by perturbing x within the search space.\n   b. Evaluate the objective function for each solution in N(x).\n   c. Select the best solution, x_best_neighbor, from N(x) that is not in the Tabu list.\n   d. If f(x_best_neighbor) > f(x_best), update x_best to x_best_neighbor.\n   e. Add x_best_neighbor to the Tabu list.\n   f. If the Tabu list size exceeds the predefined size, remove the oldest solution from the list.\n   g. Update the current solution, x, to x_best_neighbor.\n6. Repeat steps 5a-5g for the maximum number of iterations.\n7. The best solution found, x_best, corresponds to the maximum value of the function f(x) = x*cos(x) in the interval [0, 2π].\n\nNote that the Tabu search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, which means that it may not always find the exact global maximum but can provide a good approximation. The quality of the solution depends on the parameters chosen, such as the Tabu list size, the maximum number of iterations, and the method used to generate neighboring solutions."
