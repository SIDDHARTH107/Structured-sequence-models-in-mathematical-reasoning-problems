    "message_2": "To find the median weight of the car parts, we first need to sort the data in ascending order:\n\n125, 130, 134, 136, 140, 140, 140, 142, 142, 146\n\nSince there are 10 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th values):\n\nMedian = (140 + 140) / 2 = 280 / 2 = 140\n\nNow, we need to find the median absolute deviation (MAD). To do this, we first find the absolute deviation of each data point from the median:\n\n|125 - 140| = 15\n|130 - 140| = 10\n|134 - 140| = 6\n|136 - 140| = 4\n|140 - 140| = 0\n|140 - 140| = 0\n|140 - 140| = 0\n|142 - 140| = 2\n|142 - 140| = 2\n|146 - 140| = 6\n\nNow, we find the median of these absolute deviations:\n\n0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6, 10, 15\n\nAgain, since there are 10 data points, the median will be the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th values):\n\nMAD = (2 + 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the median weight of the car parts is 140 grams, and the median absolute deviation is 3 grams."
