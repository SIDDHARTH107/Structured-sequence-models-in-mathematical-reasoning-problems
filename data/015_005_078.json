    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which is defined as follows:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nIn this system, a, b, and c are the parameters. To find the period doubling bifurcation parameter value, we need to find the value of \"c\" when \"a\" and \"b\" are fixed at 0.2.\n\nUnfortunately, finding the exact value of the period doubling bifurcation parameter for the Rössler system is not straightforward and requires numerical simulations. The bifurcation diagram can be obtained by plotting the local maxima of the variable x as a function of the parameter c. The period doubling bifurcation occurs when the system transitions from a stable limit cycle to a cycle with double the period.\n\nTo find the value of \"c\" for the period doubling bifurcation, you would need to perform a numerical simulation of the Rössler system, such as using a Runge-Kutta method, and analyze the bifurcation diagram. This is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response, but there are many software tools available, such as MATLAB or Python libraries, that can help you perform these simulations and analyze the results."
