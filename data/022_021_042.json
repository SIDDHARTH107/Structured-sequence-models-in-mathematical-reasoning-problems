    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = ((s+1)^2)/(s^2 + 9s + 20), we first need to decompose the function into partial fractions. \n\nStep 1: Factor the denominator\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\ns^2 + 9s + 20 = (s + 4)(s + 5)\n\nStep 2: Decompose into partial fractions\nNow, we can write F(s) as the sum of two partial fractions:\nF(s) = A/(s + 4) + B/(s + 5)\n\nTo find the values of A and B, we need to clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation by (s + 4)(s + 5):\n(s + 1)^2 = A(s + 5) + B(s + 4)\n\nStep 3: Solve for A and B\nWe can solve for A and B by substituting suitable values for s:\n\n1. Let s = -4:\n(-3)^2 = A(-4 + 5)\n9 = A\nSo, A = 9.\n\n2. Let s = -5:\n(-4)^2 = B(-5 + 4)\n16 = -B\nSo, B = -16.\n\nNow we have the partial fraction decomposition:\nF(s) = 9/(s + 4) - 16/(s + 5)\n\nStep 4: Inverse Laplace transform\nNow we can find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) using the linearity property of the Laplace transform:\nf(t) = L^(-1){F(s)} = L^(-1){9/(s + 4)} - L^(-1){16/(s + 5)}\n\nWe know that the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s + a) is e^(-at). Therefore,\nf(t) = 9 * e^(-4t) - 16 * e^(-5t)\n\nSo, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = ((s+1)^2)/(s^2 + 9s + 20) is f(t) = 9 * e^(-4t) - 16 * e^(-5t)."
