    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the given bounds.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Perform the employed bee phase, where each employed bee modifies its solution and evaluates the new fitness.\n4. Perform the onlooker bee phase, where onlooker bees select solutions based on their fitness and modify them.\n5. Perform the scout bee phase, where the least fit solution is replaced with a new random solution if it hasn't improved for a certain number of iterations.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the maximum number of iterations or until convergence is reached.\n7. Return the best solution found.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the ABC algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 3 * x**2 - 5 * x + 2\n\ndef fitness(x):\n    return 1 / (1 + f(x))\n\ndef generate_solution(lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    return random.uniform(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n\ndef modify_solution(solution, other_solution, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    phi = random.uniform(-1, 1)\n    new_solution = solution + phi * (solution - other_solution)\n    return np.clip(new_solution, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n\ndef abc_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    solutions = [generate_solution(lower_bound, upper_bound) for _ in range(population_size)]\n    fitness_values = [fitness(x) for x in solutions]\n    \n    for iteration in range(max_iterations):\n        # Employed bee phase\n        for i in range(population_size):\n            new_solution = modify_solution(solutions[i], random.choice(solutions), lower_bound, upper_bound)\n            new_fitness = fitness(new_solution)\n            \n            if new_fitness > fitness_values[i]:\n                solutions[i] = new_solution\n                fitness_values[i] = new_fitness\n        \n        # Onlooker bee phase\n        probabilities = [f / sum(fitness_values) for f in fitness_values]\n        for i in range(population_size):\n            selected_solution = np.random.choice(solutions, p=probabilities)\n            new_solution = modify_solution(selected_solution, random.choice(solutions), lower_bound, upper_bound)\n            new_fitness = fitness(new_solution)\n            \n            if new_fitness > fitness(selected_solution):\n                solutions[solutions.index(selected_solution)] = new_solution\n                fitness_values[solutions.index(selected_solution)] = new_fitness\n        \n        # Scout bee phase\n        min_fitness_index = fitness_values.index(min(fitness_values))\n        if random.random() < 0.1:\n            solutions[min_fitness_index] = generate_solution(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n            fitness_values[min_fitness_index] = fitness(solutions[min_fitness_index])\n    \n    best_solution = solutions[fitness_values.index(max(fitness_values))]\n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\nbest_x, min_value = abc_algorithm(20, 100, -2, 2)\nprint(f\"Best x: {best_x}, Minimum value: {min_value}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the best x value and the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 using the ABC algorithm with the specified parameters. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm."
