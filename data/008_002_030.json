    "message_2": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the following formula:\n\nInverse(A) = (1/determinant(A)) * adjugate(A)\n\nwhere A is the given matrix, determinant(A) is the determinant of the matrix A, and adjugate(A) is the adjugate of the matrix A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of the given matrix:\n\ndeterminant(A) = (3 * 5) - (4 * 2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of the matrix A:\n\nadjugate(A) = [5 -4]\n              [-2 3]\n\nFinally, we can find the inverse of the matrix A:\n\nInverse(A) = (1/7) * [5 -4]\n                     [-2 3]\n\nInverse(A) = [5/7 -4/7]\n             [-2/7  3/7]\n\nSo, the inverse of the given matrix is:\n\n[5/7 -4/7]\n[-2/7  3/7]"
