    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation to eliminate x:\n\n(2x + 3y + z) - 2(x + 2y - 3z) = -2i - 2(1)\ny + 5z = -2i - 2\n\nNow, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation to eliminate x:\n\n(3x + y + 5z) - 3(x + 2y - 3z) = (3 + 4i) - 3(1)\n-5y + 14z = 4i\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\ny + 5z = -2i - 2\n-5y + 14z = 4i\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 5 and add it to the second equation to eliminate y:\n\n5(y + 5z) + (-5y + 14z) = 5(-2i - 2) + 4i\n25z + 14z = -10i - 10 + 4i\n39z = -6i - 10\n\nNow, let's solve for z:\n\nz = (-6i - 10) / 39\nz = -10/39 - 6i/39\n\nNow that we have z, let's substitute it back into the first equation to find y:\n\ny + 5(-10/39 - 6i/39) = -2i - 2\ny - 50/39 - 30i/39 = -2i - 2\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\ny = 50/39 + 30i/39 + 2i + 2\ny = (50 + 2*39)/39 + (30i + 2i)/39\ny = 128/39 + 32i/39\n\nFinally, let's substitute the values of y and z back into the original first equation to find x:\n\nx + 2(128/39 + 32i/39) - 3(-10/39 - 6i/39) = 1\n\nx + 256/39 + 64i/39 + 30/39 + 18i/39 = 1\n\nx = 1 - (286/39) - (82i/39)\nx = (39 - 286)/39 - 82i/39\nx = -247/39 - 82i/39\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -247/39 - 82i/39\ny = 128/39 + 32i/39\nz = -10/39 - 6i/39"
