    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that Alice's private key exponent d is less than 2^(256), we first need to find the range of possible values for d. In the RSA cryptosystem, d is the modular inverse of e (the public key exponent) modulo (p-1). In this case, p is a prime number, so we can use Euler's totient function to find the number of possible values for d.\n\nEuler's totient function, φ(n), calculates the number of positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n. For a prime number p, φ(p) = p - 1. In this case, φ(p) = 982449353 - 1 = 982449352.\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of e modulo φ(p). This is the value of d such that (e * d) % φ(p) = 1. Since e is given as 65537, we have:\n\nd = e^(-1) % φ(p)\nd = 65537^(-1) % 982449352\n\nThe range of possible values for d is between 1 and φ(p) - 1, which is between 1 and 982449351. Now, we want to find the probability that d is less than 2^(256). To do this, we can divide the number of values less than 2^(256) by the total number of possible values for d:\n\nProbability = (Number of values less than 2^(256)) / (Total number of possible values for d)\nProbability = (2^(256) - 1) / (982449351)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nProbability ≈ (2^(256) - 1) / (982449351)\nProbability ≈ 1.157920892373162e+77 / 982449351\nProbability ≈ 1.178657e+68\n\nSo, the probability that Alice's private key exponent d will be less than 2^(256) is approximately 1.178657e+68."
