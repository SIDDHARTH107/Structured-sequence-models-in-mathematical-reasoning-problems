    "message_1": "Given a prime number `p = 29` and generators `g1 = 3` and `g2 = 2`, Alice and Bob want to exchange a secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice chooses a secret number `a = 5` and calculates `A = g1^a mod p`. Bob chooses a secret number `b = 7` and calculates `B = g2^b mod p`. Calculate the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to communicate securely.",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate A and B:\n\nA = g1^a mod p = 3^5 mod 29\nA = 243 mod 29\nA = 4\n\nB = g2^b mod p = 2^7 mod 29\nB = 128 mod 29\nB = 2\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can calculate the shared secret key using each other's public values:\n\nShared secret key for Alice = B^a mod p = 2^5 mod 29\nShared secret key for Alice = 32 mod 29\nShared secret key for Alice = 3\n\nShared secret key for Bob = A^b mod p = 4^7 mod 29\nShared secret key for Bob = 16384 mod 29\nShared secret key for Bob = 3\n\nAs we can see, the shared secret key for both Alice and Bob is 3. They can now use this key to communicate securely."
