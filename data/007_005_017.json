    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12 and 20, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 12: 2^2 * 3^1\nPrime factorization of 20: 2^2 * 5^1\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor present in the two numbers and multiply them together:\n\nLCM(12, 20) = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60\n\nSo, the LCM of 12 and 20 is 60."
