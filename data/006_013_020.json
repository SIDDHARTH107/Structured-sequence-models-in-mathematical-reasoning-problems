    "message_1": "On average, a certain area is hit by a hurricane once every 10 years. What is the probability that a Category 4 hurricane will hit the area in the next 2 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is used to model the number of events (in this case, hurricanes) occurring in a fixed interval of time.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (hurricanes), k is the number of events we want to find the probability for, λ (lambda) is the average rate of events per interval, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, the average rate of hurricanes per interval (λ) is 1 hurricane per 10 years. Since we want to find the probability of a hurricane occurring in the next 2 years, we need to adjust the rate accordingly:\n\nλ = (1 hurricane / 10 years) * (2 years) = 0.2 hurricanes in 2 years\n\nNow we can use the Poisson formula to find the probability of a Category 4 hurricane hitting the area in the next 2 years (k = 1):\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-0.2) * 0.2^1) / 1! = (0.8187 * 0.2) / 1 = 0.1637\n\nSo, the probability that a Category 4 hurricane will hit the area in the next 2 years is approximately 16.37%."
