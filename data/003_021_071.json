    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors u and v, we can use the dot product formula and the definition of the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n\nu • v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere u • v is the dot product of u and v, ||u|| and ||v|| are the magnitudes of u and v, and θ is the angle between the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu • v = (5)(-2) + (-3)(7) = -10 - 21 = -31\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n\n||u|| = √(5^2 + (-3)^2) = √(25 + 9) = √34\n||v|| = √((-2)^2 + 7^2) = √(4 + 49) = √53\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (u • v) / (||u|| ||v||) = (-31) / (√34 * √53) ≈ -0.6243\n\nFinally, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the cosine value:\n\nθ = arccos(-0.6243) ≈ 127.87°\n\nSo, the angle between vectors u and v is approximately 127.87°."
