    "message_2": "To prove that $f(z) = f(\\overline{z})$ for $|z|<1$, we will use the fact that $f(iy)$ is real and non-negative for $0\\leq y\\leq 1$. Let $z = x + iy$ be a point in the upper half plane with $|z|<1$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),$$\n\nwhere $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ are the real and imaginary parts of $f(z)$, respectively. Now, consider the conjugate of $z$, which is $\\overline{z} = x - iy$. We have:\n\n$$f(\\overline{z}) = f(x - iy) = u(x, -y) + iv(x, -y).$$\n\nSince $f(iy)$ is real and non-negative for $0\\leq y\\leq 1$, we have $v(x, y) = 0$ for $y=0$. Thus, the imaginary part of $f(z)$ vanishes on the real axis.\n\nNow, we will use the Schwarz reflection principle to extend $f(z)$ to the lower half plane. The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a region that is symmetric with respect to the real axis and continuous on the real axis, then the function can be extended to the entire region by reflecting its values across the real axis. In other words, if $f(z)$ is analytic in the upper half plane and continuous on the real axis, then we can define an extension of $f(z)$ to the lower half plane as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) & \\text{if } \\Im(z) \\geq 0, \\\\\n\\overline{f(\\overline{z})} & \\text{if } \\Im(z) < 0.\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nSince $f(iy)$ is real and non-negative for $-1\\leq y\\leq 1$, we can extend $f(z)$ to the lower half plane using the Schwarz reflection principle. In the lower half plane, the explicit formula for $f(z)$ is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = u(x, -y) - iv(x, -y).$$\n\nThis formula holds for $|z|<1$ and $\\Im(z) < 0$."
