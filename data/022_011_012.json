At $z = 0$:\n\nThe numerator is $0^3 + 2(0)^2 + 0 = 0$. The denominator is $(0-1)(0-2)^2 = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$. Since the numerator is zero and the denominator is non-zero, there is a zero at $z = 0$. To find the order of the zero, we can look at the lowest power of $z$ in the numerator, which is $z$. Therefore, the order of the zero at $z = 0$ is 1.\n\n2. At $z = 1$:\n\nThe numerator is $1^3 + 2(1)^2 + 1 = 4$. The denominator is $(1-1)(1-2)^2 = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$. Since the numerator is non-zero and the denominator is zero, there is a pole at $z = 1$. To find the order of the pole, we can look at the power of $(z-1)$ in the denominator, which is 1. Therefore, the order of the pole at $z = 1$ is 1.\n\n3. At $z = 2$:\n\nThe numerator is $2^3 + 2(2)^2 + 2 = 16$. The denominator is $(2-1)(2-2)^2 = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$. Since the numerator is non-zero and the denominator is zero, there is a pole at $z = 2$. To find the order of the pole, we can look at the power of $(z-2)$ in the denominator, which is 2. Therefore, the order of the pole at $z = 2$ is 2.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- There is a zero of order 1 at $z = 0$.\n- There is a pole of order 1 at $z = 1$.\n- There is a pole of order 2 at $z = 2$."
