    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean income of all readers of the newspaper, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere:\n\nSample Mean = $50,000 (given)\nSample Size (n) = 40 (given)\nStandard Deviation (σ) = $8,000 (given)\nCritical Value (Z) = 1.96 (for a 95% confidence interval)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Standard Error (SE):\n\nStandard Error (SE) = σ / √n\nSE = $8,000 / √40\nSE ≈ $1,265.49\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = Critical Value * Standard Error\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * $1,265.49\nMargin of Error ≈ $2,480.36\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nLower Limit = Sample Mean - Margin of Error\nLower Limit = $50,000 - $2,480.36\nLower Limit ≈ $47,519.64\n\nUpper Limit = Sample Mean + Margin of Error\nUpper Limit = $50,000 + $2,480.36\nUpper Limit ≈ $52,480.36\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean income of all readers of the newspaper is approximately $47,519.64 to $52,480.36."
