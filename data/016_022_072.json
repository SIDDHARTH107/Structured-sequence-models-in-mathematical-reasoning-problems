    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid (also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle) is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles. After each iteration, the number of triangles increases.\n\nLet's denote the number of triangles at each iteration as T(n), where n is the iteration number.\n\nAt the first iteration (n=1), the original triangle is divided into 4 smaller equilateral triangles, so T(1) = 4.\n\nAt the second iteration (n=2), each of the 4 triangles from the first iteration is divided into 4 smaller triangles, resulting in T(2) = 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n\nIn general, at each iteration, the number of triangles is multiplied by 4. Therefore, the total number of triangles after 5 iterations can be calculated as:\n\nT(5) = 4^5 = 1024\n\nSo, there are 1024 triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid after 5 iterations of construction."
