    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we compute the normal vector N:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, 2v) = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we normalize N:\n\n|N| = √((-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 + 1^2) = √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nN_normalized = N / |N| = (-2u, -2v, 1) / √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N_normalized • r_uu = (-2u, -2v, 1) • (0, 0, 2) / √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = 2 / √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\nM = N_normalized • r_uv = (-2u, -2v, 1) • (0, 0, 0) / √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = 0\nN = N_normalized • r_vv = (-2u, -2v, 1) • (0, 0, 2) / √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = 2 / √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/2) * ( (L * N - M^2) / (E * G - F^2) )\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nL = 2 / √(4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2 + 1) = 2 / √9 = 2/3\nM = 0\nN = 2 / √(4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2 + 1) = 2 / √9 = 2/3\n\nH = (1/2) * ( (2/3 * 2/3 - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - 4^2) ) = (1/2) * (4/9) / 9 = 2/27\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2) is H = 2/27."
