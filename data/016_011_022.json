    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-similar fractal, which means that it is made up of smaller copies of itself. In each iteration, the side length of the smaller copies is scaled down by a factor of 3, and there are 5 smaller copies in total.\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the scaling factor for the side length would be (1/3)^5, since the side length is divided by 3 in each iteration.\n\n(1/3)^5 = 1/243\n\nIf the original Vicsek fractal had a side length of 1 unit, the side length of the fractal after 5 iterations would be:\n\n1 * (1/243) = 1/243 units"
