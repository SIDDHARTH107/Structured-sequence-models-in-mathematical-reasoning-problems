    "message_1": "A cable TV company charges $20 for basic service and $5 for each movie channel.  A customer wants to spend no more than $60 per month on cable TV. How many movie channels should the customer choose to maximize the number of channels and stay within the budget?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of movie channels the customer chooses. The total cost of the cable TV service can be represented by the equation:\n\n20 + 5x ≤ 60\n\nTo find the maximum number of movie channels the customer can choose, we need to solve for x:\n\n5x ≤ 60 - 20\n5x ≤ 40\nx ≤ 8\n\nThe customer can choose a maximum of 8 movie channels to stay within the $60 budget."
