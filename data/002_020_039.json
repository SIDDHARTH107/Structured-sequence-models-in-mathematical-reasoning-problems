    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 7 cm. Calculate the perimeter of a sector that has a central angle of 45 degrees. (Answer: 10.99 cm)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of a sector, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the sum of the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle, and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius r = 7 cm, and the central angle = 45 degrees.\n\nArc length = (45 / 360) × 2π(7)\nArc length = (1/8) × 14π\nArc length = 7/4π cm\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter of the sector. The perimeter is the sum of the arc length and the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = (7/4π) + 2(7)\nPerimeter = (7/4π) + 14\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nPerimeter ≈ (7/4 × 3.14) + 14\nPerimeter ≈ (5.495) + 14\nPerimeter ≈ 19.495 cm\n\nHowever, the answer provided (10.99 cm) seems to be incorrect. The correct answer should be approximately 19.495 cm."
