    "message_2": "To find the corresponding expression for the velocity profile in the frequency domain, we need to apply the Fourier transform to the given velocity profile u(y) = 3cos(2πy/L). The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nU(k) = ∫[u(y) * e^(-2πiky)] dy\n\nwhere U(k) is the Fourier transform of u(y), and k is the frequency variable in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven u(y) = 3cos(2πy/L), we can substitute this into the Fourier transform equation:\n\nU(k) = ∫[3cos(2πy/L) * e^(-2πiky)] dy\n\nNow, we can use the Euler's formula to rewrite the cosine function as:\n\ncos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nU(k) = ∫[3 * (e^(2πiy/L) + e^(-2πiy/L))/2 * e^(-2πiky)] dy\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nU(k) = (3/2) ∫[(e^(2πiy/L) * e^(-2πiky)) + (e^(-2πiy/L) * e^(-2πiky))] dy\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nU(k) = (3/2) [∫(e^(-2πi(k-1/L)y) dy) + ∫(e^(-2πi(k+1/L)y) dy)]\n\nNow, we can integrate each term with respect to y:\n\nU(k) = (3/2) [(1/(-2πi(k-1/L))) * (e^(-2πi(k-1/L)y)) + (1/(-2πi(k+1/L))) * (e^(-2πi(k+1/L)y))]\n\nWe need to evaluate this integral over the height of the channel, which is from 0 to H = 0.5 m:\n\nU(k) = (3/2) [(1/(-2πi(k-1/L))) * (e^(-2πi(k-1/L)H) - e^(0)) + (1/(-2πi(k+1/L))) * (e^(-2πi(k+1/L)H) - e^(0))]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nU(k) = (3/2) [(1/(-2πi(k-1))) * (e^(-πi(k-1)) - 1) + (1/(-2πi(k+1))) * (e^(-πi(k+1)) - 1)]\n\nThis is the expression for the velocity profile in the frequency domain. Note that this expression is valid for a continuous Fourier transform. In practice, you would likely use a discrete Fourier transform for numerical calculations."
