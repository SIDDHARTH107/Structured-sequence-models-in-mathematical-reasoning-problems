    "message_2": "To show that f is continuous at x = 3, we need to prove that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 3 is equal to f(3). In other words, we need to show that:\n\nlim (x -> 3) f(x) = f(3)\n\nFirst, let's find f(3):\n\nf(3) = 2(3) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nNow, let's find the limit of f(x) as x approaches 3:\n\nlim (x -> 3) f(x) = lim (x -> 3) (2x + 1)\n\nSince f(x) is a linear function, it is continuous everywhere, and we can directly substitute the value of x = 3 into the function to find the limit:\n\nlim (x -> 3) (2x + 1) = 2(3) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSince the limit of f(x) as x approaches 3 is equal to f(3), we can conclude that f is continuous at x = 3."
