Determine the number of possible divisors for each prime factor: For 2, we have 1, 2, and 3 as possible divisors. For 3, we have 1 and 2 as possible divisors.\n\n3. Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order: n(G) = (p^(a-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(b-1) * (q-1)), where p and q are prime factors, and a and b are their respective exponents.\n\n4. Calculate the number of groups for each combination of divisors:\n\n   - For divisors 1 and 1: n(G) = (2^(1-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1)) = 1 * 2 = 2\n   - For divisors 2 and 1: n(G) = (2^(2-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1)) = 2 * 2 = 4\n   - For divisors 3 and 1: n(G) = (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1)) = 4 * 2 = 8\n   - For divisors 1 and 2: n(G) = (2^(1-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(2-1) * (3-1)) = 1 * 6 = 6\n   - For divisors 2 and 2: n(G) = (2^(2-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(2-1) * (3-1)) = 2 * 6 = 12\n   - For divisors 3 and 2: n(G) = (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(2-1) * (3-1)) = 4 * 6 = 24\n\n5. Add up the number of groups for each combination of divisors: 2 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 56\n\nTherefore, there are 56 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
