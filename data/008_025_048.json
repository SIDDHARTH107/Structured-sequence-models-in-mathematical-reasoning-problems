    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. However, we can notice that all three equations are multiples of each other. Let's demonstrate that:\n\n1. The second equation can be obtained by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n   (2)(x + 3y) = (2)(7)\n   2x + 6y = 14\n\n2. The third equation can be obtained by multiplying the first equation by 3:\n   (3)(x + 3y) = (3)(7)\n   3x + 9y = 21\n\nSince all three equations represent the same line, there are infinitely many solutions that satisfy the system of equations. To express the solutions, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\nx + 3y = 7\n\n3y = 7 - x\n\ny = (7 - x) / 3\n\nSo, the solutions to this system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\n(x, (7 - x) / 3) for any value of x."
