    "message_2": "To find the vertex of a parabola given by the equation y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 8, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = -8 / (2 * 2) = -8 / 4 = -2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging the x value back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(-2)^2 + 8(-2) + 5 = 2(4) - 16 + 5 = 8 - 16 + 5 = -3\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-2, -3)."
