    "message_1": "A traveling salesman is visiting five cities and wants to find the shortest route to visit all of them exactly once, and return to the starting city. The distances between the cities are as follows:\n\n- City 1 to City 2: 10 km\n- City 1 to City 3: 12 km\n- City 1 to City 4: 8 km\n- City 1 to City 5: 15 km\n- City 2 to City 3: 6 km\n- City 2 to City 4: 10 km\n- City 2 to City 5: 8 km\n- City 3 to City 4: 7 km\n- City 3 to City 5: 11 km\n- City 4 to City 5: 9 km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance the salesman can travel to visit all five cities and return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for each possible route and then selecting the shortest one. There are 5 cities, so there are (5-1)! = 4! = 24 possible routes. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 2 (because the reverse of each route is the same), so there are 12 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the 12 unique routes and their total distances:\n\n1. 1-2-3-4-5-1: 10+6+7+9+15 = 47 km\n2. 1-2-3-5-4-1: 10+6+11+9+8 = 44 km\n3. 1-2-4-3-5-1: 10+10+7+11+15 = 53 km\n4. 1-2-4-5-3-1: 10+10+9+11+12 = 52 km\n5. 1-2-5-3-4-1: 10+8+11+7+8 = 44 km\n6. 1-2-5-4-3-1: 10+8+9+7+12 = 46 km\n7. 1-3-2-4-5-1: 12+6+10+9+15 = 52 km\n8. 1-3-2-5-4-1: 12+6+8+9+8 = 43 km\n9. 1-3-4-2-5-1: 12+7+10+8+15 = 52 km\n10. 1-3-4-5-2-1: 12+7+9+8+10 = 46 km\n11. 1-3-5-2-4-1: 12+11+8+10+8 = 49 km\n12. 1-3-5-4-2-1: 12+11+9+10+10 = 52 km\n\nThe shortest possible distance is 43 km, following the route 1-3-2-5-4-1."
