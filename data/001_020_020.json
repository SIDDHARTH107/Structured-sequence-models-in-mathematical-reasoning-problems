    "message_2": "To graph the absolute value equation y = |2x + 3|, we will first find three different points by choosing three different x-values, calculating the corresponding y-values, and then plotting these points on the coordinate plane.\n\nLet's choose x = -2, x = 0, and x = 2 as our three x-values.\n\n1. For x = -2:\ny = |2(-2) + 3|\ny = |-4 + 3|\ny = |-1|\ny = 1\nSo, the point is (-2, 1).\n\n2. For x = 0:\ny = |2(0) + 3|\ny = |0 + 3|\ny = |3|\ny = 3\nSo, the point is (0, 3).\n\n3. For x = 2:\ny = |2(2) + 3|\ny = |4 + 3|\ny = |7|\ny = 7\nSo, the point is (2, 7).\n\nNow, let's plot these three points on the coordinate plane:\n\n1. Point (-2, 1): Move 2 units to the left from the origin and 1 unit up.\n2. Point (0, 3): Move 3 units up from the origin.\n3. Point (2, 7): Move 2 units to the right from the origin and 7 units up.\n\nAfter plotting these points, draw a V-shaped graph connecting the points, as the graph of an absolute value function has a V-shape. The graph of the equation y = |2x + 3| is now complete."
