    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. To find A', we can list out the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nUniversal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we can see that the elements 5 and 6 are in U but not in A. Therefore, the complement of set A is:\n\nA' = {5, 6}\n\nTo prove that this complement is unique, we need to show that there is no other set that can be the complement of A with respect to U. Since U contains all possible elements, any other set that is not A must contain elements from A' or elements not in U. If a set contains elements from A', it cannot be the complement of A because it shares elements with A'. If a set contains elements not in U, it cannot be the complement of A because it is not a subset of U.\n\nThus, the complement of set A, A' = {5, 6}, is unique."
