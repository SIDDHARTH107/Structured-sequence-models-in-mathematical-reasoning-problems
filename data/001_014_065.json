    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{63}$, we need to find the prime factors of 63 and see if any of them can be paired up.\n\nThe prime factorization of 63 is $3^2 \\cdot 7$. Since there is a pair of 3's, we can take one 3 out of the square root.\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n$\\sqrt{63} = \\sqrt{3^2 \\cdot 7} = 3\\sqrt{7}$"
