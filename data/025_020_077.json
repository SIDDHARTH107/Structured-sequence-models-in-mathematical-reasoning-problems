    "message_2": "To show that the only non-vanishing cohomology group of the sheaf Rⁱπ_*L on a smooth projective curve π: C → X is Hⁱ(C, L|C), we will use the Leray spectral sequence. The Leray spectral sequence relates the cohomology of the sheaf Rⁱπ_*L on X with the cohomology of the sheaf L on C. It is given by:\n\nE₂^{p,q} = H^p(X, R^qπ_*L) ⇒ H^{p+q}(C, L|C).\n\nSince X is a Calabi-Yau variety, it has trivial canonical bundle, i.e., K_X ≅ O_X. Therefore, the line bundle L = O_X(-K_X) is isomorphic to O_X. Now, we have:\n\nE₂^{p,q} = H^p(X, R^qπ_*O_X) ⇒ H^{p+q}(C, O_C).\n\nSince X is a Calabi-Yau variety, it has vanishing odd-dimensional cohomology groups. Therefore, H^p(X, R^qπ_*O_X) = 0 for odd p. Moreover, for even p, we have:\n\nH^p(X, R^qπ_*O_X) = H^0(C, R^qπ_*O_X) = H^q(C, O_C).\n\nThus, the only non-vanishing cohomology group of the sheaf Rⁱπ_*L on a smooth projective curve π: C → X is Hⁱ(C, L|C).\n\nNow, let's consider the case d = 3, L = O_X(−K_X), and C a genus 2 curve embedded in X with normal bundle N_C/X isomorphic to O_C(d−1). We want to calculate H⁰(C, N_C/X).\n\nSince N_C/X ≅ O_C(d-1), we have:\n\nH⁰(C, N_C/X) = H⁰(C, O_C(2)).\n\nNow, we use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves, which states that for a line bundle L on a smooth projective curve C of genus g, we have:\n\nh^0(C, L) - h^1(C, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g.\n\nIn our case, L = O_C(2), g = 2, and deg(L) = 2(d-1). Therefore, we have:\n\nh^0(C, O_C(2)) - h^1(C, O_C(2)) = 2(d-1) + 1 - 2.\n\nSince d = 3, we get:\n\nh^0(C, O_C(2)) - h^1(C, O_C(2)) = 3.\n\nNow, we need to find h^1(C, O_C(2)). By Serre duality, we have:\n\nh^1(C, O_C(2)) = h^0(C, K_C ⊗ O_C(−2)).\n\nSince C is a genus 2 curve, K_C ≅ O_C(2g-2) = O_C(2). Therefore, we have:\n\nh^1(C, O_C(2)) = h^0(C, O_C).\n\nSince O_C is the trivial line bundle on C, we have h^0(C, O_C) = 1. Thus, we get:\n\nh^0(C, N_C/X) = h^0(C, O_C(2)) = h^1(C, O_C(2)) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4."
