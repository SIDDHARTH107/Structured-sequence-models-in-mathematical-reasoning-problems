    "message_2": "Let $C$ be a smooth plane cubic curve and let $D$ be a divisor on $C$ of degree $9$. We want to find the Riemann-Roch space $L(D)$ of the divisor $D$. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$ on a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$,\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the Riemann-Roch space $L(D)$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$, and $g$ is the genus of the curve $C$. \n\nFor a smooth plane cubic curve, the genus $g$ is given by the formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, $d = 3$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1$.\n\nNow, we are given that the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials on $C$ is $2$. This is equal to $l(K_C)$, since holomorphic differentials correspond to the canonical divisor. \n\nUsing the Riemann-Roch theorem, we can write:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g = 9 + 1 - 1 = 9$.\n\nSince $l(K_C) = 2$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - (2 - l(D)) = 9$.\n\nSolving for $l(D)$, we get:\n\n$2l(D) - 2 = 9 \\Rightarrow l(D) = \\frac{11}{2}$.\n\nHowever, the dimension of the Riemann-Roch space must be an integer. This contradiction implies that there is no smooth plane cubic curve $C$ with a divisor $D$ of degree $9$ such that the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials on $C$ is $2$."
