    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example:\n\nA company produces two products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while each unit of Product B requires 1 hour of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The company has available 100 hours of labor and 120 hours of machine time per day. If the profit from each unit of Product A is $10 and from each unit of Product B is $15, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its daily profit?\n\nPlease note that this problem involves setting up a system of linear equations and using a linear programming technique called the Simplex Method to solve.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n2x + y ≤ 100 (Labor constraint)\n3x + 4y ≤ 120 (Machine time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 100\n   y ≤ -2x + 100\n\n2. 3x + 4y ≤ 120\n   y ≤ (-3/4)x + 30\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (0,30), (20,60), and (40,20). Now, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0,30) = 10(0) + 15(30) = $450\n3. P(20,60) = 10(20) + 15(60) = $1000\n4. P(40,20) = 10(40) + 15(20) = $700\n\nThe maximum profit of $1000 is achieved when the company produces 20 units of Product A and 60 units of Product B."
