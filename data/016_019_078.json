(Note: Each iteration involves replacing each line segment with four segments that are 1/3 the length of the original segment.)",
    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by the Koch curve, which is a fractal created by the iterative process described. Let's find the perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration.\n\nIn the first iteration, we replace the initial line segment of length 1 with four segments, each of length 1/3. So, the total length after the first iteration is 4 * (1/3) = 4/3.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the four segments from the first iteration is replaced by four segments, each of length 1/3 of the original segment. So, the total length after the second iteration is 4 * (4/3) * (1/3) = 16/9.\n\nIn the third iteration, each of the 16 segments from the second iteration is replaced by four segments, each of length 1/3 of the original segment. So, the total length after the third iteration is 4 * (16/9) * (1/3) = 64/27.\n\nIn the fourth iteration, each of the 64 segments from the third iteration is replaced by four segments, each of length 1/3 of the original segment. So, the total length after the fourth iteration is 4 * (64/27) * (1/3) = 256/81.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration is 256/81."
