    "message_2": "There are five possible group structures for a group of order 8:\n\n1. Z_8: The cyclic group of order 8.\n2. Z_4 × Z_2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2: The direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2.\n4. D_4: The dihedral group of order 8 (symmetries of a square).\n5. Q_8: The quaternion group of order 8.\n\nWe need to determine which of these structures is isomorphic to the group G = {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} with i, j, and k satisfying the relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1 and ijk = -1.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate Z_8 and Z_4 × Z_2 because these groups are abelian (commutative), and G is non-abelian since, for example, ij = k ≠ -k = ji.\n\nNext, we can eliminate Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 because it has no element of order 4, while G has elements of order 4 (i, -i, j, -j, k, -k).\n\nFinally, we can eliminate D_4 because it has only one element of order 4, while G has six elements of order 4.\n\nTherefore, the group G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q_8, which has the following presentation:\n\nQ_8 = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k | i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1}"
