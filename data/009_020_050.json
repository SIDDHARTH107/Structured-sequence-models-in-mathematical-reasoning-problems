The system is subject to the initial condition x(0) = [1, 0].''\n\nLet a = 2, b = 1, and c = [2, 1]. Design a feedback controller of the form u = -kx to stabilize the system and find the values of k that make the system stable.",
    "message_2": "To design a feedback controller of the form u = -kx, we first need to analyze the closed-loop system. The closed-loop system can be described as:\n\ndx/dt = a * x - b * k * x = (a - b * k) * x\n\nWe want to find the values of k that make the system stable. A stable system has all its eigenvalues with negative real parts. In this case, the eigenvalue of the system is (a - b * k). \n\nGiven a = 2, b = 1, we have:\n\nEigenvalue = (2 - 1 * k)\n\nTo make the system stable, we need the eigenvalue to be negative:\n\n2 - k < 0\n\nk > 2\n\nSo, any value of k greater than 2 will make the system stable."
