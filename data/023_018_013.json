    "message_2": "To determine the frequency response function of the system, we need to apply the Fourier transform to both the input and output signals. The frequency response function is defined as the ratio of the output signal's Fourier transform to the input signal's Fourier transform.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transforms of the input and output signals.\n\nInput signal: f(t) = 2 cos(5t)\nFourier transform of f(t): F(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nF(ω) = ∫[2 cos(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite the cosine function as:\ncos(5t) = (e^(j5t) + e^(-j5t))/2\n\nNow, the Fourier transform becomes:\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-jωt) * (e^(j5t) + e^(-j5t))/2] dt\nF(ω) = (1/2) ∫[e^(-j(ω-5)t) + e^(-j(ω+5)t)] dt\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\nF(ω) = (1/2) [(-j/(ω-5)) * e^(-j(ω-5)t) + (-j/(ω+5)) * e^(-j(ω+5)t)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince the integral converges, we get:\nF(ω) = (1/2) [(-j/(ω-5)) * (2πδ(ω-5)) + (-j/(ω+5)) * (2πδ(ω+5))]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nF(ω) = -jπ[δ(ω-5) - δ(ω+5)]\n\nNow let's find the Fourier transform of the output signal.\n\nOutput signal: g(t) = e^(-t) sin(t)\nFourier transform of g(t): G(ω) = ∫[g(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nG(ω) = ∫[e^(-t) sin(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite the sine function as:\nsin(t) = (e^(jt) - e^(-jt))/(2j)\n\nNow, the Fourier transform becomes:\nG(ω) = ∫[e^(-t) * (e^(jt) - e^(-jt))/(2j) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nG(ω) = (1/2j) ∫[(e^(-t) * e^(jt) - e^(-t) * e^(-jt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\nG(ω) = (1/2j) [(1/(jω+1)) * e^((jω+1)t) - (1/(jω-1)) * e^((jω-1)t)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince the integral converges, we get:\nG(ω) = (1/2j) [(1/(jω+1)) * (2πδ(ω+1)) - (1/(jω-1)) * (2πδ(ω-1))]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nG(ω) = π[δ(ω+1)/(jω+1) - δ(ω-1)/(jω-1)]\n\nNow, we can find the frequency response function H(ω) by taking the ratio of G(ω) to F(ω):\n\nH(ω) = G(ω) / F(ω)\nH(ω) = [π[δ(ω+1)/(jω+1) - δ(ω-1)/(jω-1)]] / [-jπ[δ(ω-5) - δ(ω+5)]]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nH(ω) = [δ(ω+1)/(j(ω+1)) - δ(ω-1)/(j(ω-1))] / [δ(ω-5) - δ(ω+5)]\n\nThis is the frequency response function of the system."
