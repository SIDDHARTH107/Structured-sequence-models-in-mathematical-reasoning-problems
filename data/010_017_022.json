    "message_1": "Suppose we have a smooth, closed 2-dimensional surface with positive genus. Let f be a Morse function on this surface, with exactly k critical points. Use the Morse inequalities to find an upper bound for the Betti numbers of the surface in terms of k.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the Betti numbers of the surface as b_0, b_1, and b_2, which represent the number of connected components, loops, and voids respectively. According to the Morse inequalities, we have:\n\nm_i ≤ b_i, for i = 0, 1, 2\n\nwhere m_i is the number of critical points of index i.\n\nSince the surface is closed and has positive genus, it is connected, so b_0 = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the Euler characteristic of the surface, denoted as χ. For a closed surface with genus g, we have:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nThe Euler characteristic can also be expressed in terms of Betti numbers:\n\nχ = b_0 - b_1 + b_2\n\nCombining these two expressions, we get:\n\n2 - 2g = 1 - b_1 + b_2\n\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n\nb_1 - b_2 = 1 - 2g\n\nNow, let's consider the Morse inequalities:\n\nm_0 ≤ b_0\nm_1 ≤ b_1\nm_2 ≤ b_2\n\nSince f has exactly k critical points, we have:\n\nm_0 + m_1 + m_2 = k\n\nUsing the inequalities above, we can write:\n\nb_0 ≤ m_0 + 1\nb_1 ≤ m_1 + 1\nb_2 ≤ m_2 + 1\n\nAdding these inequalities, we get:\n\nb_0 + b_1 + b_2 ≤ m_0 + m_1 + m_2 + 3\n\nSince b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = k + 3, we have:\n\nb_1 + b_2 ≤ k + 2\n\nCombining this inequality with the equation b_1 - b_2 = 1 - 2g, we can find the upper bounds for b_1 and b_2:\n\nb_1 ≤ (k + 2 + 1 - 2g)/2 = (k + 3 - 2g)/2\nb_2 ≤ (k + 2 - 1 + 2g)/2 = (k + 1 + 2g)/2\n\nSo, the upper bounds for the Betti numbers of the surface in terms of k are:\n\nb_0 ≤ 1\nb_1 ≤ (k + 3 - 2g)/2\nb_2 ≤ (k + 1 + 2g)/2"
