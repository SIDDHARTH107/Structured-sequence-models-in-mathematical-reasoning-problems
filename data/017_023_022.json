    "message_2": "There are 9 distinct non-abelian groups of order 72. Two examples of these groups are the semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_8 (denoted as Z_9 ⋊ Z_8) and the semidirect product of Z_3 × Z_3 and Z_8 (denoted as (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_8).\n\nHowever, providing the complete group tables for these groups would be impractical due to their size (72x72 elements). Instead, I will provide a brief explanation of their structure and how to construct them.\n\n1. Z_9 ⋊ Z_8:\n\nThis group is a semidirect product of Z_9 (cyclic group of order 9) and Z_8 (cyclic group of order 8). To construct this group, we need a homomorphism φ: Z_8 → Aut(Z_9). Aut(Z_9) is isomorphic to Z_6, so we need to find a homomorphism from Z_8 to Z_6. One such homomorphism is given by φ(x) = x mod 6. The elements of Z_9 ⋊ Z_8 can be represented as pairs (a, b), where a ∈ Z_9 and b ∈ Z_8. The group operation is defined as (a, b)(c, d) = (a + φ(b)(c), b + d).\n\n2. (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_8:\n\nThis group is a semidirect product of Z_3 × Z_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3) and Z_8 (cyclic group of order 8). To construct this group, we need a homomorphism φ: Z_8 → Aut(Z_3 × Z_3). Aut(Z_3 × Z_3) is isomorphic to GL(2, 3), which has 48 elements. One such homomorphism is given by φ(x) = A^x, where A is a 2x2 matrix with entries in Z_3 that has order 8 in GL(2, 3). The elements of (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_8 can be represented as pairs ((a, b), c), where (a, b) ∈ Z_3 × Z_3 and c ∈ Z_8. The group operation is defined as ((a, b), c)((d, e), f) = ((a, b) + φ(c)(d, e), c + f).\n\nThese are just two examples of non-abelian groups of order 72. The other seven groups can be constructed using similar techniques, involving semidirect products and homomorphisms between appropriate groups."
