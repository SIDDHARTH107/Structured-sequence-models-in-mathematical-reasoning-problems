    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a nonlinear delay differential equation given by:\n\n$\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\beta \\frac{x(t-\\tau)}{1 + x(t-\\tau)^{\\delta}} - \\gamma x(t)$\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to linearize the equation around the trajectory of the system and then analyze the stability of the linearized system. This process is quite involved and requires advanced numerical methods.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with an approximate value for the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the given parameters. For the Mackey-Glass equation with parameters $\\beta = 0.2$, $\\gamma = 0.1$, $\\tau = 17$, $\\delta = 10$, and initial condition $x_0 = 1.2$, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is approximately $\\lambda \\approx 0.006$.\n\nKeep in mind that this value is an approximation, and a more accurate value would require a more detailed numerical analysis."
