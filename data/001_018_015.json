    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nlog base 2 (8) - log base 2 (2) + log base 2 (16)\n\nFirst, we can find the values of each logarithm:\n\nlog base 2 (8) = 3, since 2^3 = 8\nlog base 2 (2) = 1, since 2^1 = 2\nlog base 2 (16) = 4, since 2^4 = 16\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression:\n\n3 - 1 + 4\n\nPerform the arithmetic operations:\n\n2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 6."
