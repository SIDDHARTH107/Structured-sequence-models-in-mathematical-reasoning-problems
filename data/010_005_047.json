    "message_2": "To determine if the set A is connected or path-connected, we first need to understand the definitions of these terms.\n\nA set is connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open subsets. A set is path-connected if for any two points in the set, there exists a continuous path connecting them.\n\nNow, let's analyze the set A. The first part of the set, {(x, y) ∈ R²: x² + y² < 1}, represents an open disk with radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0). The second part of the set is a single point, (2, 0), which is outside the open disk.\n\nTo show that A is not connected, we can find two disjoint open sets U and V such that A = U ∪ V. Let U = {(x, y) ∈ R²: x² + y² < 1} and V = {(x, y) ∈ R²: (x - 2)² + y² < 1}. These two sets are open and disjoint, and A = U ∪ V. Therefore, A is not connected.\n\nNow, let's check if A is path-connected. Consider any two points p and q in A. If both points are in the open disk, there exists a continuous path connecting them within the disk. However, if one of the points is (2, 0), there is no continuous path connecting it to a point inside the open disk without crossing the boundary of the disk, which is not in A. Thus, A is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the set A is neither connected nor path-connected."
