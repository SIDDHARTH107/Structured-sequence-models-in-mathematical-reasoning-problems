    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 7 cm. What is the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 60 degrees?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 60 degrees, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that the radius is 7 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 7²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 49\n\nArea of sector = 49π/6\n\nTherefore, the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 60 degrees in a circle with a radius of 7 cm is 49π/6 square centimeters."
