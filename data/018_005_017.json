    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and its complement set A' is the empty set, we need to show that there are no elements that are common to both sets.\n\nLet's denote the intersection of set A and set A' as A ∩ A'. We want to show that A ∩ A' = ∅.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an element x such that x ∈ A ∩ A'. By definition of intersection, this means that x ∈ A and x ∈ A'.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the definition of a complement set. A complement set A' contains all elements that are not in set A. Since x ∈ A, it cannot also be in A' (x ∉ A').\n\nThis contradiction shows that our assumption was false, and there cannot be any element x that belongs to both A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of set A and its complement set A' is indeed the empty set:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅."
