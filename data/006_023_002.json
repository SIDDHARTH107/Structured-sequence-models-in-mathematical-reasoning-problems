    "message_1": "In a survey of 500 potential customers, it was found that 200 preferred to buy product A, 150 preferred to buy product B, and 50 preferred to buy both products. What is the probability of a customer buying product A if they are chosen at random from this group?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a customer buying product A if chosen at random, we need to determine the number of customers who prefer product A and divide it by the total number of potential customers.\n\nHowever, since 50 customers prefer both products, we need to account for this overlap to avoid double-counting. So, we will subtract the 50 customers who prefer both products from the sum of customers who prefer product A and product B.\n\nNumber of customers who prefer only product A = 200 (prefer product A) - 50 (prefer both products) = 150\nNumber of customers who prefer only product B = 150 (prefer product B) - 50 (prefer both products) = 100\nNumber of customers who prefer both products = 50\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a customer buying product A if chosen at random:\n\nP(A) = (Number of customers who prefer only product A + Number of customers who prefer both products) / Total number of potential customers\nP(A) = (150 + 50) / 500\nP(A) = 200 / 500\nP(A) = 0.4\n\nSo, the probability of a customer buying product A if they are chosen at random from this group is 0.4 or 40%."
