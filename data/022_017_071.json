    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first find the characteristic equation:\n\n$r^2 + 4 = 0$\n\nThis equation has the solutions $r = \\pm 2i$. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\n$y(x) = c_1 e^{2ix} + c_2 e^{-2ix}$\n\nNow we need to find the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ using the initial conditions.\n\n1) $y(0) = 2+3i$\n\nPlugging in $x=0$ into the general solution, we get:\n\n$y(0) = c_1 e^{0} + c_2 e^{0} = c_1 + c_2$\n\nSo, $c_1 + c_2 = 2+3i$.\n\n2) $y'(0) = 5-4i$\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the general solution:\n\n$y'(x) = 2ic_1 e^{2ix} - 2ic_2 e^{-2ix}$\n\nNow, plugging in $x=0$:\n\n$y'(0) = 2ic_1 e^{0} - 2ic_2 e^{0} = 2ic_1 - 2ic_2$\n\nSo, $2ic_1 - 2ic_2 = 5-4i$.\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n\n$c_1 + c_2 = 2+3i$\n$2ic_1 - 2ic_2 = 5-4i$\n\nSolve for $c_1$ and $c_2$:\n\nDivide the second equation by $2i$:\n\n$c_1 - c_2 = -2+i$\n\nNow, we can solve this system of linear equations:\n\n$c_1 = (2+3i) - c_2$\n$c_1 - c_2 = -2+i$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\n$(2+3i) - c_2 - c_2 = -2+i$\n\nSolve for $c_2$:\n\n$2c_2 = 4+2i$\n$c_2 = 2+i$\n\nNow, substitute $c_2$ back into the first equation to find $c_1$:\n\n$c_1 = (2+3i) - (2+i)$\n$c_1 = 2i$\n\nNow we have the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$, so we can write the particular solution:\n\n$y(x) = (2i) e^{2ix} + (2+i) e^{-2ix}$"
