    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the one-time pad key \"XYZZZ\", we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Convert each letter in the plaintext message and the one-time pad key to their numerical values.\n   HELLO: 7 (H), 4 (E), 11 (L), 11 (L), 14 (O)\n   XYZZZ: 23 (X), 24 (Y), 25 (Z), 25 (Z), 25 (Z)\n\n2. Add the numerical values of the corresponding letters in the plaintext message and the one-time pad key.\n   7+23 = 30, 4+24 = 28, 11+25 = 36, 11+25 = 36, 14+25 = 39\n\n3. If the sum is greater than or equal to 26, subtract 26 to get the encrypted letter's numerical value.\n   30-26 = 4, 28-26 = 2, 36-26 = 10, 36-26 = 10, 39-26 = 13\n\n4. Convert the numerical values back to letters.\n   4 (E), 2 (C), 10 (K), 10 (K), 13 (N)\n\nThe encrypted message is \"ECKKN\"."
