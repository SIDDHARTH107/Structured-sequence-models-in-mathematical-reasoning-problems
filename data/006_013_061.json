    "message_1": "A certain region has a 10% probability of experiencing a severe earthquake in any given year. What is the probability that this region will experience at least one severe earthquake in the next three years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that the region will NOT experience a severe earthquake in the next three years, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of experiencing at least one severe earthquake.\n\nThe probability of not experiencing a severe earthquake in any given year is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nFor three consecutive years with no severe earthquakes, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.90 * 0.90 * 0.90 = 0.729.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of experiencing at least one severe earthquake in the next three years: 1 - 0.729 = 0.271.\n\nSo, the probability of experiencing at least one severe earthquake in the next three years is 27.1%."
