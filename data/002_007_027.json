    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (base1 + base2) × height\n\nIn this case, base1 = 9 units, base2 = 13 units, and height = 6 units. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (9 + 13) × 6\nArea = (1/2) × 22 × 6\nArea = 11 × 6\nArea = 66 square units\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 66 square units."
