    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $8 and for product B is $12. The company has a total of 100 units of resources available for production, and the production of one unit of A requires 2 units of resources while one unit of B requires 3 units of resources. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal combination of product A and product B that can be produced using the available resources. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function (profit) is given by:\n\nP(x, y) = 8x + 12y\n\nThe constraint is given by the total resources available:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 100\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region and the corner points. To do this, we can first find the intercepts of the constraint equation:\n\nWhen x = 0:\n2(0) + 3y = 100\ny = 100/3 ≈ 33.33\n\nWhen y = 0:\n2x + 3(0) = 100\nx = 50\n\nSo, we have the points (0, 33.33) and (50, 0). To find the other corner point, we can solve the constraint equation as an equality:\n\n2x + 3y = 100\n\nWe can use the intercepts to find the slope of the line:\n\nm = (0 - 33.33) / (50 - 0) = -33.33 / 50 = -2/3\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the line:\n\ny = -2/3x + 33.33\n\nSince the slope is negative, we know that the feasible region is below the line. The corner points are (0, 33.33), (50, 0), and the intersection of the line with the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\n\nP(0, 33.33) = 8(0) + 12(33.33) = $400\nP(50, 0) = 8(50) + 12(0) = $400\n\nSince both corner points yield the same maximum profit, there is no unique solution. The company can produce any combination of product A and product B along the line 2x + 3y = 100 to achieve a maximum profit of $400."
