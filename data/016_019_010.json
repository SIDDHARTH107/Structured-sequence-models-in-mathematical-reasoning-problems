    "message_2": "The fractal dimension of the Koch Island (also known as the Koch Snowflake) remains constant regardless of the number of iterations. The fractal dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch Snowflake, each line segment is divided into 4 new segments, so N = 4. The scaling factor is 3, as each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the fractal dimension of the Koch Island after the 4th iteration (or any iteration) is approximately 1.2619."
