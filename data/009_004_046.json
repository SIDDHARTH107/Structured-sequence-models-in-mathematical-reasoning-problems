    "message_1": "A 10 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. Initially, the mass is displaced 0.2 meters from its equilibrium position and released. What is the amplitude, period, and angular frequency of the resulting oscillations?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formulas for simple harmonic motion. \n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the mass is initially displaced 0.2 meters from its equilibrium position, so the amplitude is 0.2 meters.\n\n2. Angular frequency (ω): The angular frequency can be found using the formula ω = √(k/m), where k is the spring constant and m is the mass. In this case, k = 50 N/m and m = 10 kg.\n\nω = √(50 N/m / 10 kg) = √(5 s^(-2)) = √5 rad/s\n\n3. Period (T): The period is the time it takes for one complete oscillation. It can be found using the formula T = 2π/ω.\n\nT = 2π/√5 ≈ 2.81 s\n\nSo, the amplitude is 0.2 meters, the angular frequency is √5 rad/s, and the period is approximately 2.81 seconds."
