    "message_1": "How many line segments will be there in the fourth iteration of the Koch island fractal, if the initial equilateral triangle has a side length of 5 units?\n\n(Note: In the first iteration, each straight line segment is replaced by four smaller segments, each a third the length of the original. This process is repeated to create subsequent iterations of the fractal.)",
    "message_2": "To find the number of line segments in the fourth iteration of the Koch island fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (4^n)\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the fourth iteration (n = 4):\n\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (4^4) = 3 * (256) = 768\n\nSo, there will be 768 line segments in the fourth iteration of the Koch island fractal."
