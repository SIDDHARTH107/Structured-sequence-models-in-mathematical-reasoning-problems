    "message_1": "Suppose we have the complex function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z}$, defined on the region $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{-1\\}$. What is the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the point $z = -1$?",
    "message_2": "The function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z}$ has a singularity at $z = -1$. To find an analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the point $z = -1$, we can try to remove the singularity by finding a function that agrees with $f(z)$ on the region $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{-1\\}$ and is also analytic at $z = -1$.\n\nOne way to do this is to consider the Laurent series of $f(z)$ around $z = -1$. The Laurent series is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_n (z+1)^n$$\n\nwhere $a_n$ are the coefficients of the series. To find the coefficients, we can use the formula:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{(z+1)^{n+1}} dz$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a simple closed contour around $z = -1$. For $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z}$, we have:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{1}{(z+1)^{n+1}(1+z)} dz$$\n\nSince the function has a simple pole at $z = -1$, we can use the residue theorem to find the coefficients. The residue theorem states that:\n\n$$\\oint_C f(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}(f(z), z = -1)$$\n\nFor $n \\neq -1$, the integrand has a pole of order greater than 1 at $z = -1$, so the integral is zero. Thus, $a_n = 0$ for $n \\neq -1$. For $n = -1$, we have:\n\n$$a_{-1} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{1}{(z+1)^{0}(1+z)} dz = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{1}{1+z} dz$$\n\nUsing the residue theorem, we find that the residue of the integrand at $z = -1$ is 1. Therefore, $a_{-1} = 1$. The Laurent series of $f(z)$ around $z = -1$ is then:\n\n$$f(z) = (z+1)^{-1}$$\n\nSince the Laurent series has no terms with negative powers of $(z+1)$ other than the $-1$ term, the function is analytic at $z = -1$. Therefore, the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the point $z = -1$ is the same function:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z}$$"
