The table below represents the probability of producing each type of product given the production of the previous day.\n\n|    | A   | B   | C   |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| A | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.3 |\n| B | 0.2  | 0.5  | 0.3 |\n| C | 0.1  | 0.2  | 0.7 |\n\nIf the production on Day 1 is 100 units of A, 50 units of B, and 25 units of C, what will be the expected production of each product on Day 2?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected production of each product on Day 2, we can use the given probabilities and the production numbers from Day 1.\n\nExpected production of A on Day 2:\nFrom A: 100 units * 0.4 = 40 units\nFrom B: 50 units * 0.3 = 15 units\nFrom C: 25 units * 0.3 = 7.5 units\nTotal expected production of A on Day 2: 40 + 15 + 7.5 = 62.5 units\n\nExpected production of B on Day 2:\nFrom A: 100 units * 0.2 = 20 units\nFrom B: 50 units * 0.5 = 25 units\nFrom C: 25 units * 0.2 = 5 units\nTotal expected production of B on Day 2: 20 + 25 + 5 = 50 units\n\nExpected production of C on Day 2:\nFrom A: 100 units * 0.3 = 30 units\nFrom B: 50 units * 0.3 = 15 units\nFrom C: 25 units * 0.7 = 17.5 units\nTotal expected production of C on Day 2: 30 + 15 + 17.5 = 62.5 units\n\nSo, the expected production on Day 2 is 62.5 units of A, 50 units of B, and 62.5 units of C."
