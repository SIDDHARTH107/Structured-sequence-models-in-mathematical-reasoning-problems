    "message_2": "A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. To find the key used in this Caesar cipher, we need to determine how many positions each letter in the plaintext \"HELLO\" has been shifted to get the ciphertext \"EBIIL\".\n\nLet's compare the positions of each letter in the plaintext and ciphertext:\n\nPlaintext:  H  E  L  L  O\nPosition:   8  5 12 12 15\n\nCiphertext: E  B  I  I  L\nPosition:   5  2  9  9 12\n\nNow, let's find the difference in positions for each letter:\n\nDifference: 3  3  3  3  3\n\nThe difference is consistent for all letters, which means the key used in this Caesar cipher is 3. The plaintext has been shifted 3 positions back in the alphabet to get the ciphertext."
