    "message_1": "Alice and Bob are using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to agree on a shared secret key for their conversation. They are using a prime number p = 11 and a primitive root g = 2. Alice chooses a secret number a = 3 and sends Bob g^a mod p. Bob chooses a secret number b = 4 and sends Alice g^b mod p. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their conversation?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the values that Alice and Bob send to each other:\n\nAlice sends Bob: A = g^a mod p = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\nBob sends Alice: B = g^b mod p = 2^4 mod 11 = 16 mod 11 = 5\n\nNow, Alice and Bob will compute the shared secret key using the received values and their own secret numbers:\n\nAlice computes: K = B^a mod p = 5^3 mod 11 = 125 mod 11 = 4\nBob computes: K = A^b mod p = 8^4 mod 11 = 4096 mod 11 = 4\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their conversation is 4."
