    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let's first find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\nThe order of G is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5^1. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_5 divides 4 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have n_2 ∈ {1, 5} and n_5 ∈ {1, 4}. Let P_2 and P_5 be Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G, respectively.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Let P_2 = ⟨a⟩ and P_5 = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 4 and b has order 5. Since P_2 and P_5 are normal, we have G = P_2 * P_5, and the elements of G can be written as {a^i * b^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, 0 ≤ j ≤ 4}. Since the orders of a and b are relatively prime, G is a cyclic group generated by ab, and G is isomorphic to C20.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. The unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 is normal in G. Let P_5 = ⟨b⟩, where b has order 5. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups, and let P_2 = ⟨a⟩, where a has order 4. Since P_5 is normal, we have G = P_2 * P_5, and the elements of G can be written as {a^i * b^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, 0 ≤ j ≤ 4}. \n\nNow, let's consider the action of a on b. Since a and b are elements of G, we have a * b * a^(-1) ∈ P_5. Since P_5 is of prime order, this implies that a * b * a^(-1) = b or a * b * a^(-1) = b^(-1). If a * b * a^(-1) = b, then G is abelian and isomorphic to C20, which contradicts the assumption that there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups. Therefore, a * b * a^(-1) = b^(-1), and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 4\nIn this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 5-subgroups. Since there is no unique Sylow subgroup, we cannot use the same argument as in the previous cases. However, we know that G cannot be isomorphic to C20 or D10, as those cases have been covered. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group G' of order 20.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n1) The cyclic group C20 (if n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1)\n2) The dihedral group D10 (if n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1)\n3) The non-abelian group G' of order 20 (if n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 4)"
