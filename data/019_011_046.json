    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of students who like both math and science, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of students = 100\nNumber of students who like math = 75\nNumber of students who like science = 60\n\nLet's assume that the minimum number of students like both math and science. In this case, the sum of the students who like math and the students who like science would be equal to the total number of students in the class.\n\n75 (students who like math) + 60 (students who like science) - x (students who like both) = 100\n\nSolving for x:\n\n135 - x = 100\nx = 35\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who like both math and science is 35."
