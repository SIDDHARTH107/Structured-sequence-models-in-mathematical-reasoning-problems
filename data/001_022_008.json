    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0.\n\n0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 11x + 12\n\nTo find the x-intercepts, we can try to factor the polynomial or use numerical methods to find the roots. In this case, we can factor by grouping:\n\n0 = x^2(x - 2) - 11(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term (x - 2):\n\n0 = (x - 2)(x^2 - 11)\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nx^2 - 11 = 0 => x = ±√11\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 2, x = -√11, and x = √11.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to find the value of f(x) when x = 0:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 2(0)^2 - 11(0) + 12 = 12\n\nSo, the y-intercept is y = 12."
