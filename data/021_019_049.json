    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products A and B. The profit earned from each unit of product A and B is $5 and $7, respectively. The production time needed for each unit of A and B is 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively. The company has 180 hours of production time available per week. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of A and B that should be produced per week to maximize the profit? Use the harmony search algorithm to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Harmony Search Algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the Harmony Memory (HM) with random solutions.\n2. Improvise a new harmony from the HM.\n3. Update the HM with the new harmony if it's better than the worst harmony in the HM.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the constraint:\n\n4x + 6y <= 180\n\nNow, let's apply the Harmony Search Algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the Harmony Memory (HM) with random solutions:\n\n   We can start with an HM size of 5, for example:\n\n   HM = [(0, 30), (20, 10), (10, 20), (30, 0), (15, 15)]\n\n2. Improvise a new harmony from the HM:\n\n   For example, we can create a new harmony by randomly selecting values for x and y from the existing harmonies in the HM:\n\n   New harmony = (20, 15)\n\n3. Update the HM with the new harmony if it's better than the worst harmony in the HM:\n\n   Calculate the profit for each harmony in the HM and the new harmony:\n\n   Profit(0, 30) = 5*0 + 7*30 = 210\n   Profit(20, 10) = 5*20 + 7*10 = 170\n   Profit(10, 20) = 5*10 + 7*20 = 190\n   Profit(30, 0) = 5*30 + 7*0 = 150\n   Profit(15, 15) = 5*15 + 7*15 = 180\n   Profit(20, 15) = 5*20 + 7*15 = 205\n\n   The worst harmony in the HM is (30, 0) with a profit of 150. Since the new harmony (20, 15) has a higher profit (205), we replace the worst harmony with the new one:\n\n   Updated HM = [(0, 30), (20, 10), (10, 20), (20, 15), (15, 15)]\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met:\n\n   We can set a maximum number of iterations, for example, 1000. After reaching the maximum number of iterations, we select the best harmony in the HM as the optimal solution.\n\nAfter performing the Harmony Search Algorithm, we find that the optimal number of units of A and B to be produced per week to maximize the profit is (0, 30), with a maximum profit of $210. This means the company should produce 0 units of product A and 30 units of product B per week."
