    "message_2": "To simplify the square root of 162, we can find the prime factors of 162 and then pair them up.\n\n162 = 2 × 81\n81 = 3 × 27\n27 = 3 × 9\n9 = 3 × 3\n\nSo, 162 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3\n\nNow, we can pair up the factors:\n\n√162 = √(2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3) = √(2 × (3 × 3) × (3 × 3))\n\nSince the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can rewrite this as:\n\n√162 = √2 × √(3 × 3) × √(3 × 3)\n\nNow, we can simplify the square roots of the perfect squares:\n\n√162 = √2 × 3 × 3\n\n√162 = 9√2\n\nSo, the simplified form of the square root of 162 is 9√2."
