    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 4 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(4³)\n\nV = (4/3)π(64)\n\nV = 256/3π\n\nThe volume of the sphere with radius 4 cm is approximately 268.08 cubic centimeters."
