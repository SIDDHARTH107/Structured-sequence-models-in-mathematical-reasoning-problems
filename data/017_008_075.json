    "message_2": "To determine whether the group G of order 8 is isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4, we can analyze the properties of these groups and compare them to G.\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8. It has one element of order 8, and all other non-identity elements have orders that are divisors of 8.\n\n2. Q8: The quaternion group of order 8. It has one element of order 1 (the identity), six elements of order 4, and one element of order 2.\n\n3. D4: The dihedral group of order 8. It has one element of order 1 (the identity), five elements of order 2, and two elements of order 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G:\n\na) Determine the number of elements of each order in G. If G has one element of order 8, it is isomorphic to C8. If G has six elements of order 4 and one element of order 2, it is isomorphic to Q8. If G has five elements of order 2 and two elements of order 4, it is isomorphic to D4.\n\nb) Analyze the structure of G. If G is abelian (commutative), it cannot be isomorphic to Q8 or D4, as both of these groups are non-abelian. If G is non-abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to C8, as cyclic groups are abelian.\n\nBy comparing the properties of G to those of C8, Q8, and D4, we can determine which group G is isomorphic to. To prove the isomorphism, we can construct an isomorphism function between G and the corresponding group, showing that it is a bijection and preserves the group operation."
