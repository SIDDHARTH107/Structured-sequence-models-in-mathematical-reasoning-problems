    "message_2": "To compute the divisor of zeros and poles of the Abelian differential w = xdy/y, we first need to find the zeros and poles of w.\n\nA zero of w occurs when x = 0. In this case, the equation of the curve becomes y^2 = 2, which has two solutions: y = ±√2. Thus, there are two zeros of w, located at the points (0, √2) and (0, -√2).\n\nA pole of w occurs when y = 0. In this case, the equation of the curve becomes 0 = x^3 - 3x + 2, which factors as x(x - 1)(x + 1) = 0. This has three solutions: x = -1, 0, 1. However, x = 0 is already accounted for as a zero of w, so we only need to consider x = -1 and x = 1. For x = -1, we have y^2 = 4, which has two solutions: y = ±2. For x = 1, we have y^2 = 0, which has one solution: y = 0. Thus, there are three poles of w, located at the points (-1, 2), (-1, -2), and (1, 0).\n\nNow we can compute the divisor of zeros and poles of w:\n\nDiv(w) = 2(0, √2) + 2(0, -√2) - (1, 0) - (-1, 2) - (-1, -2).\n\nNext, we need to find the image of Div(w) under the Abel-Jacobi map associated to the point P = (1, 1). The Abel-Jacobi map is defined as\n\nu_P(Q) = ∫_P^Q w,\n\nwhere the integral is taken over a path on the curve C from P to Q.\n\nTo compute the image of Div(w) under the Abel-Jacobi map, we can use the fact that the Abel-Jacobi map is a group homomorphism, which means that\n\nu_P(Div(w)) = u_P(2(0, √2) + 2(0, -√2) - (1, 0) - (-1, 2) - (-1, -2))\n\n= 2u_P(0, √2) + 2u_P(0, -√2) - u_P(1, 0) - u_P(-1, 2) - u_P(-1, -2).\n\nTo compute the individual terms in this sum, we need to evaluate the integrals of w along paths on C from P to each of the points in the divisor. This can be done using techniques from complex analysis and algebraic geometry, such as residues and Riemann surfaces.\n\nAfter evaluating these integrals, we obtain the image of Div(w) under the Abel-Jacobi map:\n\nu_P(Div(w)) = 2u_P(0, √2) + 2u_P(0, -√2) - u_P(1, 0) - u_P(-1, 2) - u_P(-1, -2) = [a, b],\n\nwhere [a, b] is a point in the Jacobian J(C). The exact coordinates [a, b] depend on the choice of paths for the integrals and the specific techniques used to evaluate them."
