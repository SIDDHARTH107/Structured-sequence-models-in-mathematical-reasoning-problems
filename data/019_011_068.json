    "message_1": "Consider the relevance logic formula R := A ⊃ B, where A and B are propositions. Let A be the proposition \"x is an even number\" and B be the proposition \"x is a number greater than 10.\" \n\nProvide an example of a natural number x that satisfies the formula R, and prove that it satisfies the formula.",
    "message_2": "Let x = 12, which is a natural number.\n\nNow, we need to show that x satisfies the formula R, which is A ⊃ B.\n\nA: \"x is an even number\"\nB: \"x is a number greater than 10\"\n\nFor x = 12:\n\nA is true, since 12 is an even number (12 can be divided by 2 without a remainder).\nB is true, since 12 is a number greater than 10.\n\nSince both A and B are true, the implication A ⊃ B is also true. Therefore, x = 12 satisfies the formula R."
