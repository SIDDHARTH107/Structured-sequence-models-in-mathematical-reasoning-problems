    "message_1": "Suppose you want to encrypt the message \"MEET ME AT NOON\" using a transposition cipher, where the key is a permutation of numbers {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. If you choose the key (2, 4, 1, 5, 3), what will be the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MEET ME AT NOON\" using a transposition cipher with the key (2, 4, 1, 5, 3), we first need to write the message in a grid with the same number of columns as the length of the key (5 columns in this case). We can ignore spaces and pad the message with extra characters if needed. Let's use 'X' as the padding character.\n\nThe grid will look like this:\n\nM E E T M\nE A T N O\nO N X X X\n\nNow, we need to rearrange the columns according to the key. The key (2, 4, 1, 5, 3) means that the first column in the encrypted message will be the second column of the original message, the second column will be the fourth column, the third column will be the first column, the fourth column will be the fifth column, and the fifth column will be the third column.\n\nRearranging the columns according to the key, we get:\n\nE T M E E\nA N E O T\nN X O X X\n\nNow, we read the encrypted message row by row:\n\nETMEE ANEO T N X O X X\n\nThe encrypted message is \"ETMEEANETNXXOXX\"."
