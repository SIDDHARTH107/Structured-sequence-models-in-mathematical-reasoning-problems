    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 for x in the interval [0, 2π], follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(x):\n2sin(x) + 1 = 0\n2sin(x) = -1\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\n2. Find the angles x in the interval [0, 2π] that have a sine of -1/2:\nSince sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we will find the reference angle in the first quadrant and then determine the angles in the third and fourth quadrants.\n\nThe reference angle for sin(x) = 1/2 is x = π/6 (or 30°). So, the angles in the third and fourth quadrants are:\n\nThird quadrant: x = π + π/6 = 7π/6\nFourth quadrant: x = 2π - π/6 = 11π/6\n\n3. Check the solutions:\nsin(7π/6) = -1/2\nsin(11π/6) = -1/2\n\nBoth solutions are valid.\n\nSo, the solutions for the trigonometric equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 7π/6 and x = 11π/6."
