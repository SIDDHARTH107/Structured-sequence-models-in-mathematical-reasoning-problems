    "message_1": "A farmer wants to maximize the profit he gets from selling crops. He has a knapsack with a maximum capacity of 50 kilograms, and 3 types of crops available: wheat, corn, and rice. The table below shows the profit per kilogram and weight per kilogram for each crop:\n\n| Crop | Profit per kg (in dollars) | Weight per kg (in kg) |\n|------|---------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Wheat | 2.50 | 1.5 |\n| Corn | 5.00 | 2.0 |\n| Rice | 3.00 | 1.0 |\n\nWhat combination and amount of crops should the farmer put in the knapsack to maximize his profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we should first calculate the profit-to-weight ratio for each crop:\n\n| Crop | Profit per kg (in dollars) | Weight per kg (in kg) | Profit-to-Weight Ratio |\n|------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| Wheat | 2.50 | 1.5 | 2.50 / 1.5 = 1.67 |\n| Corn | 5.00 | 2.0 | 5.00 / 2.0 = 2.50 |\n| Rice | 3.00 | 1.0 | 3.00 / 1.0 = 3.00 |\n\nNow, we should prioritize the crops with the highest profit-to-weight ratio. In this case, the order is Rice > Corn > Wheat.\n\n1. Start with Rice:\n   - The knapsack can hold up to 50 kg, and Rice has a weight of 1 kg per unit.\n   - So, the farmer can take 50 kg of Rice.\n   - This would give a profit of 50 kg * $3.00/kg = $150.\n\n2. Next, try adding Corn:\n   - The knapsack is already full with Rice, so there's no room for Corn.\n\n3. Finally, try replacing some Rice with Wheat:\n   - Replacing Rice with Wheat would decrease the profit-to-weight ratio, so it's not a good idea.\n\nTherefore, the farmer should fill the knapsack with 50 kg of Rice to maximize his profit, which would be $150."
