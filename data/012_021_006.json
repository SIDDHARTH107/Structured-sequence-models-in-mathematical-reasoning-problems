    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph G, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find a tree decomposition of the graph.\n2. Compute the width of the tree decomposition.\n3. The treewidth of the graph is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions.\n\nA tree decomposition of a graph G is a tree T where each node of T is a subset of vertices of G, called a bag, such that:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the vertex set of G.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in G, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. If a vertex v is in two bags, then it is in every bag on the path between those two bags in T.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can construct a tree decomposition as follows:\n\n1. Create a bag for each edge in G, containing the two vertices of the edge.\n2. Connect the bags in the tree decomposition based on the adjacency of the edges in G.\n\nThe tree decomposition T will look like this:\n\nBag 1: {1, 2}\nBag 2: {1, 3}\nBag 3: {2, 3}\nBag 4: {2, 4}\nBag 5: {3, 4}\nBag 6: {3, 5}\nBag 7: {4, 5}\nBag 8: {4, 6}\nBag 9: {5, 6}\nBag 10: {5, 7}\nBag 11: {6, 7}\nBag 12: {6, 8}\nBag 13: {7, 8}\nBag 14: {7, 9}\nBag 15: {8, 9}\n\nThe connections between the bags are as follows:\n\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 12 - 13 - 14 - 15\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case, all bags have a size of 2, so the width of the tree decomposition is 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of the given graph G is 1."
