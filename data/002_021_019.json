    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector that you ate, we first need to find the area of the whole pizza and then divide it by 2 since you ate half of it.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the pizza is 16 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 8 inches.\n\nNow we can find the area of the whole pizza:\n\nA = π(8^2)\nA = π(64)\nA ≈ 201.06 square inches\n\nSince you ate half of the pizza, the area of the sector you ate is:\n\nArea of sector = (1/2) * 201.06 ≈ 100.53 square inches"
