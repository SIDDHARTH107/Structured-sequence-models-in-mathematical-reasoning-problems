    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector of a circle, we need to calculate the arc length and then add the two radii. The formula for the arc length (L) is:\n\nL = (central angle/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is in degrees.\n\nFirst, let's find the arc length:\n\nL = (75/360) * 2π(9)\nL = (1/4.8) * 18π\nL ≈ 3.75π cm\n\nNow, add the two radii (each 9 cm) to the arc length:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter ≈ 3.75π + 18\nPerimeter ≈ 11.75π cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 11.75π cm or approximately 36.88 cm."
