    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can start by simplifying the equations and checking for any dependencies between them.\n\nDivide the second equation by 2:\n3x - 2y + z = 10 (1)\n3x - 2y + z = 10 (2)\n\nDivide the third equation by 3:\n3x - 2y + z = 10 (1)\n3x - 2y + z = 10 (2)\n3x - 2y + z = 10 (3)\n\nAs we can see, all three equations are the same, which means they represent the same line in three-dimensional space. Since they are the same line, there are infinitely many solutions that satisfy all three equations.\n\nTo express the solutions, we can solve for one variable in terms of the others. Let's solve for z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = 10 - 3x + 2y\n\nNow, we can express the general solution as:\n\n(x, y, 10 - 3x + 2y)\n\nThis represents all possible solutions to the system of linear equations."
