    "message_1": "An auctioneer has an item up for sale and seven bidders, each with their own valuation of the item. The valuations are $10, $20, $30, $40, $50, $60, and $70. The auction will be conducted using the second-price sealed-bid auction format. What bid should each bidder place in order to maximize their chances of winning the item while minimizing the amount they pay?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the item but pays the second-highest bid. To maximize their chances of winning while minimizing the amount they pay, each bidder should bid their true valuation of the item. This is because bidding higher than their valuation would result in overpaying if they win, and bidding lower would decrease their chances of winning without any benefit.\n\nSo, each bidder should place the following bids:\n- Bidder 1: $10\n- Bidder 2: $20\n- Bidder 3: $30\n- Bidder 4: $40\n- Bidder 5: $50\n- Bidder 6: $60\n- Bidder 7: $70\n\nIn this scenario, Bidder 7 would win the item and pay the second-highest bid, which is $60."
