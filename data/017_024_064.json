    "message_2": "There are 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 96. I will list some of them, including the ones you mentioned, and provide their group structures:\n\n1. C96: The cyclic group of order 96.\n2. A4 × C4 × C2: The alternating group of degree 4, direct product with the cyclic groups of order 4 and 2.\n3. C48 × C2: Direct product of cyclic groups of order 48 and 2.\n4. C32 × C3: Direct product of cyclic groups of order 32 and 3.\n5. C16 × C6: Direct product of cyclic groups of order 16 and 6.\n6. C8 × C12: Direct product of cyclic groups of order 8 and 12.\n7. C4 × C24: Direct product of cyclic groups of order 4 and 24.\n8. C2 × C48: Direct product of cyclic groups of order 2 and 48.\n9. C3 × (C2 × C32): Direct product of cyclic groups of order 3 and 2, and a cyclic group of order 32.\n10. C6 × (C2 × C16): Direct product of cyclic groups of order 6 and 2, and a cyclic group of order 16.\n11. C12 × (C2 × C8): Direct product of cyclic groups of order 12 and 2, and a cyclic group of order 8.\n12. C24 × (C2 × C4): Direct product of cyclic groups of order 24 and 2, and a cyclic group of order 4.\n13. C48 × (C2 × C2): Direct product of cyclic groups of order 48 and 2, and another cyclic group of order 2.\n14. C3 × (C2 × C2 × C16): Direct product of cyclic groups of order 3, 2, 2, and 16.\n15. C6 × (C2 × C2 × C8): Direct product of cyclic groups of order 6, 2, 2, and 8.\n\nThese are some of the non-isomorphic groups of order 96, including the cyclic group C96 and the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2. The remaining non-abelian groups are more complex and difficult to list exhaustively."
