    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem, we will first find the critical points of the function f(x) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero. Then, we will check the endpoints of the constraint interval and compare the values of f(x) at these points to find the minimum value.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf(x) = (x^2 - 6x + 7) / (x - 2)\n\nWe can use the quotient rule to find the derivative:\n\nf'(x) = [(d/dx)(x^2 - 6x + 7) * (x - 2) - (x^2 - 6x + 7) * (d/dx)(x - 2)] / (x - 2)^2\n\nf'(x) = [(2x - 6) * (x - 2) - (x^2 - 6x + 7) * 1] / (x - 2)^2\n\nf'(x) = [(2x^2 - 10x + 12) - (x^2 - 6x + 7)] / (x - 2)^2\n\nf'(x) = (x^2 - 4x + 5) / (x - 2)^2\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting f'(x) to zero:\n\n0 = (x^2 - 4x + 5) / (x - 2)^2\n\nSince the denominator cannot be zero, we only need to set the numerator to zero:\n\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 5\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-(-4) ± √((-4)^2 - 4 * 1 * 5)] / (2 * 1)\n\nx = [4 ± √(16 - 20)] / 2\n\nx = [4 ± √(-4)] / 2\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for x. Therefore, there are no critical points in the domain of f(x).\n\nNow, let's check the endpoints of the constraint interval:\n\nf(4) = (4^2 - 6 * 4 + 7) / (4 - 2) = (16 - 24 + 7) / 2 = (-1) / 2 = -0.5\n\nSince there are no critical points in the domain of f(x), the minimum value of f(x) occurs at the endpoint x = 4. The minimum value of f(x) is -0.5."
