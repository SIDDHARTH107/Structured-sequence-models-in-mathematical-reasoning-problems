    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using a rail fence transposition cipher with 4 rails, we will arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows and then read the message horizontally.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the length of the message and the number of columns. The length of the message is 21 characters. We can calculate the number of columns by considering that each full cycle of the zigzag pattern (down and up) contains 4 + (4 - 2) = 6 characters. So, we have 21 / 6 = 3.5 cycles. Since we can't have half a cycle, we will have 3 full cycles and one extra column for the remaining characters.\n\nNow, we can arrange the letters in the zigzag pattern:\n\nH . . . E . . . T\n. A . A . K . Y .\n. . D . G . R . C\nS . . . L . . . N\n\nThe extra column will have the remaining characters:\n\nH . . . E . . . T\n. A . A . K . Y . D\n. . D . G . R . C .\nS . . . L . . . N . I\n. . . . . . . . . . O\n\nNow, we can read the message horizontally: \"HARD_TO_DECRYPT_AKESLGINYO\"\n\nThe decrypted message is \"HARD_TO_DECRYPT_AKESLGINYO\"."
