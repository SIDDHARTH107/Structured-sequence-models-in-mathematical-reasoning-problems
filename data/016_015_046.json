    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The order of a Hilbert curve refers to the number of iterations used to generate the curve. With each iteration, the number of segments in the curve increases.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 1, there are 4 segments.\nFor each subsequent order, the number of segments is multiplied by 4.\n\nTo find the number of segments in a Hilbert curve of order 4, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^(Order)\n\nNumber of segments = 4^4 = 256\n\nSince each segment of the curve measures 1 unit in length, the perimeter of a Hilbert curve of order 4 is equal to the number of segments, which is 256 units."
