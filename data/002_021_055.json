    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 7cm. Find the area of a sector of the circle that has a central angle of 75 degrees. (Round your answer to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere the central angle is given in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 75 degrees, and the radius (r) is 7 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (75 / 360) * π * 7^2\n\nArea of sector = (75 / 360) * π * 49\n\nArea of sector = (0.208333) * π * 49\n\nArea of sector = 10.1859 * π\n\nArea of sector ≈ 32.00 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the sector with a central angle of 75 degrees and a radius of 7 cm is approximately 32.00 cm^2."
