    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function $f(x) = x$ on the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi)$, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$. Since $f(x)$ is an odd function, we know that $a_n = 0$ for all $n$. We can find the $b_n$ coefficients using the following formula:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(nx) dx$$\n\nFor $f(x) = x$, we have:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x \\sin(nx) dx$$\n\nWe can solve this integral using integration by parts. Let $u = x$ and $dv = \\sin(nx) dx$. Then, $du = dx$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{n} \\cos(nx)$. Applying integration by parts:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[-\\frac{1}{n}x\\cos(nx) \\Big|_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} + \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos(nx) dx\\right]$$\n\nThe integral of $\\cos(nx)$ over $(-\\pi, \\pi)$ is zero, so we are left with:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[-\\frac{1}{n}\\pi\\cos(n\\pi) + \\frac{1}{n}(-\\pi)\\cos(-n\\pi)\\right]$$\n\nSince $\\cos(n\\pi) = (-1)^n$, we have:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{n}((-1)^n - (-1)^n) = 0$$ for even $n$, and\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{n}((-1)^n - (-1)^n) = \\frac{2}{n}$$ for odd $n$.\n\nThus, the Fourier series for $f(x) = x$ is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(nx) = \\sum_{n \\text{ odd}}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n} \\sin(nx)$$\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the Fourier series converges pointwise or uniformly on the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi)$. Since $f(x)$ is continuous and piecewise smooth on $(-\\pi, \\pi)$, the Fourier series converges pointwise to $f(x)$ on the interval.\n\nHowever, the Fourier series does not converge uniformly on the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi)$. This is because the function $f(x) = x$ has a jump discontinuity at the endpoints of the interval, and the Fourier series converges to the average of the left and right limits at the points of discontinuity. In this case, the average is zero, which is not equal to the function value at the endpoints. Therefore, the Fourier series does not converge uniformly on the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi)$."
