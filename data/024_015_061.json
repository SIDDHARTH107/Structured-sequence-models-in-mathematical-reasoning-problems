    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to take the exterior derivative of each term in the 1-form $\\omega$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a function $f$ with respect to a coordinate $x^i$ is given by $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} dx^i$. \n\nFirst, let's compute the exterior derivative of each term in $\\omega$:\n\n1. For the term $x\\,dy\\wedge dz$, we have $d(x\\,dy\\wedge dz) = dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz$.\n\n2. For the term $y\\,dx\\wedge dz$, we have $d(y\\,dx\\wedge dz) = dy\\wedge dx\\wedge dz$.\n\n3. For the term $z\\,dx\\wedge dy$, we have $d(z\\,dx\\wedge dy) = dz\\wedge dx\\wedge dy$.\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ by summing up the exterior derivatives of each term:\n\n$d\\omega = d(x\\,dy\\wedge dz) + d(y\\,dx\\wedge dz) + d(z\\,dx\\wedge dy)$\n$= dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz + dy\\wedge dx\\wedge dz + dz\\wedge dx\\wedge dy$\n\nNow, we need to simplify this expression by applying the antisymmetry property of the wedge product. Recall that for any 1-forms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, we have $\\alpha\\wedge\\beta = -\\beta\\wedge\\alpha$. Using this property, we can rewrite the expression for $d\\omega$ as:\n\n$d\\omega = dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz - dx\\wedge dz\\wedge dy + dz\\wedge dx\\wedge dy$\n\nNow, we can see that the second and third terms cancel each other out, leaving us with:\n\n$d\\omega = dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz$\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate $d\\omega$ at the point $(1,1,1)$ on $M$. Since $d\\omega$ does not depend on the coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$, its value is the same at every point on $M$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$d\\omega(1,1,1) = dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz$"
