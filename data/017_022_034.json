Determine the possible divisors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their properties.\n\nAfter analyzing the Sylow subgroups and their properties, we find that there are 5 nonisomorphic groups of order 60:\n\n1. Cyclic group: Z_60\n2. Dihedral group: D_30\n3. The direct product of Z_3 and the symmetric group on 4 elements: Z_3 x S_4\n4. The direct product of Z_5 and the alternating group on 4 elements: Z_5 x A_4\n5. The direct product of Z_3 and the dihedral group on 10 elements: Z_3 x D_10\n\nSo, there are 5 possible nonisomorphic groups of order 60."
