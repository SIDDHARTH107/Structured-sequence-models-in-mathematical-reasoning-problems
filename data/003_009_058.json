    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. Since we have one angle and two sides given, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of the third side.\n\nThe Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides. In this case, we have:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths, and A, B, and C are the angles opposite those sides, respectively.\n\nWe are given one angle (35°) and the two sides adjacent to it (8 meters and 10 meters). Let's call the given angle A, the side opposite angle A as a, the 8-meter side as b, and the 10-meter side as c. We can now use the Law of Sines to find the length of side a:\n\na / sin(35°) = 8 / sin(B) = 10 / sin(C)\n\nWe can find angle B using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\nA + B + C = 180°\n35° + B + C = 180°\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\ncos(C) = (a^2 + 8^2 - 10^2) / (2a * 8)\n\nWe can now use the fact that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 to find sin(C):\n\nsin(C) = sqrt(1 - cos^2(C))\n\nNow we can substitute sin(C) back into the Law of Sines equation:\n\na / sin(35°) = 10 / sin(C)\n\nWe can now solve for a:\n\na = 10 * sin(35°) / sin(C)\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding up the side lengths:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c = a + 8 + 10\n\nSubstitute the value of a:\n\nPerimeter = 10 * sin(35°) / sin(C) + 8 + 10\n\nThis expression gives us the perimeter of the triangle in terms of angle C. To find the exact value of the perimeter, we would need more information about angle C or the relationship between angles B and C."
