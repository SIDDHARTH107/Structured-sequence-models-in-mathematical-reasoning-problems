    "message_2": "To find the equation representing the position of each point on the string at any time t, we need to consider the wave equation. Since the string is fixed at both ends, it will have a standing wave pattern. The general equation for a standing wave is:\n\ny(x, t) = A(x) * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A(x) is the amplitude function, ω is the angular frequency, t is time, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nWe are given the initial displacement of the string as y(x) = 0.2 sin(πx). This represents the amplitude function A(x) as a function of position x. Since the string is fixed at both ends, the wave will have a sinusoidal shape with a wavelength equal to twice the length of the string. Therefore, the wavelength λ = 4 meters.\n\nThe wave speed (v) is given as 10 meters per second. We can find the angular frequency (ω) using the relationship between wave speed, wavelength, and frequency:\n\nv = λf\n\nwhere f is the frequency. We can rewrite this in terms of angular frequency:\n\nv = λ(ω / 2π)\n\nSolving for ω, we get:\n\nω = 2πv / λ\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nω = 2π(10) / 4 = 5π rad/s\n\nSince the initial displacement is given as a sine function, the phase angle φ = 0.\n\nNow we can write the equation for the position of each point on the string at any time t:\n\ny(x, t) = A(x) * cos(ωt + φ)\ny(x, t) = 0.2 sin(πx) * cos(5πt)\n\nThis equation represents the position of each point on the string at any time t."
