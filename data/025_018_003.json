    "message_2": "To show that there exists a non-empty open subset $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{A}^2$ such that the inverse image $\\phi^{-1}(U)$ is isomorphic to a smooth projective variety, we first need to find the domain of definition of the rational map $\\phi$. The rational map $\\phi$ is not defined when $x_1 = x_2 = 0$, since the coordinates $(x_1^2, x_2^2)$ would be undefined. Therefore, the domain of definition of $\\phi$ is $\\mathbb{P}^2 \\setminus \\{[1:0:0]\\}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse image $\\phi^{-1}(U)$, where $U = \\mathbb{A}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. We will show that $\\phi^{-1}(U)$ is isomorphic to a smooth projective variety. \n\nFor $(u,v) \\in U$, we have $\\phi^{-1}(u,v) = \\{[x_0:x_1:x_2] \\in \\mathbb{P}^2 \\setminus \\{[1:0:0]\\} \\mid x_1^2 = u, x_2^2 = v\\}$. Substituting $x_1^2 = u$ and $x_2^2 = v$ into the equation of the projective variety, we get:\n\n$$\nx_0^3 - u^2 - v^2 = 0\n$$\n\nLet $V$ be the projective variety defined by this equation. We claim that $V$ is smooth. To show this, we compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x_0$, $u$, and $v$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_0} (x_0^3 - u^2 - v^2) = 3x_0^2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} (x_0^3 - u^2 - v^2) = -2u\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} (x_0^3 - u^2 - v^2) = -2v\n$$\n\nThe variety $V$ is smooth if the gradient $(3x_0^2, -2u, -2v)$ is non-zero for all points $(x_0, u, v) \\in V$. Since $U = \\mathbb{A}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, we have $(u,v) \\neq (0,0)$, and hence the gradient is non-zero. Therefore, $V$ is a smooth projective variety.\n\nFinally, we have $\\phi^{-1}(U) \\cong V$, and the equation of the smooth projective variety $V$ is given by:\n\n$$\nx_0^3 - u^2 - v^2 = 0\n$$"
