    "message_2": "To find the value of sec(π/3) using the unit circle, we first need to find the cosine of π/3. The unit circle has a radius of 1, and the cosine function gives the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle.\n\nFor an angle of π/3 (or 60 degrees), the coordinates of the point on the unit circle are (1/2, √3/2). The x-coordinate is 1/2, which is the cosine of π/3.\n\nNow, the secant function is the reciprocal of the cosine function. So, sec(π/3) = 1/cos(π/3) = 1/(1/2) = 2.\n\nTherefore, the value of sec(π/3) using the unit circle is 2."
