    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of sets A and B is a subset of each of the sets, we need to show that every element in the intersection of A and B is also an element of A and B.\n\nThe intersection of sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B. In this case, A ∩ B = {3, 7}.\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x from the intersection A ∩ B. We have two possibilities for x: x = 3 or x = 7.\n\n1) If x = 3, then x is an element of A (since 3 is in A) and x is an element of B (since 3 is in B).\n\n2) If x = 7, then x is an element of A (since 7 is in A) and x is an element of B (since 7 is in B).\n\nIn both cases, x is an element of A and B. Therefore, every element in the intersection A ∩ B is also an element of A and B.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the intersection of sets A and B, A ∩ B, is a subset of each of the sets A and B."
