    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean math score, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- x̄ is the sample mean (85 in this case)\n- t is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case) and degrees of freedom (n-1)\n- s is the sample standard deviation (10 in this case)\n- n is the sample size (30 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score. Since we have a sample size of 30, we have 29 degrees of freedom (n-1). For a 95% confidence interval and 29 degrees of freedom, the t-score is approximately 2.045.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 85 ± (2.045 * (10 / √30))\n\nCI = 85 ± (2.045 * (10 / 5.477))\n\nCI = 85 ± (2.045 * 1.826)\n\nCI = 85 ± 3.736\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean math score is approximately (81.264, 88.736)."
