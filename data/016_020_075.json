    "message_1": "If we start with a tetrahedron with an edge length of 8 units, and then construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron by recursively removing the inner tetrahedrons that have edge lengths half of the outer tetrahedrons, what will be the total surface area of all the removed tetrahedrons after 4 iterations?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the surface area of a single tetrahedron with an edge length of 8 units. The surface area of a tetrahedron can be found using the formula:\n\nSurface area = √3 * (edge length)^2\n\nSo, for a tetrahedron with an edge length of 8 units:\n\nSurface area = √3 * (8)^2 = 64√3 square units\n\nNow, let's find the total surface area of the removed tetrahedrons after each iteration:\n\nIteration 1: We remove 1 tetrahedron with edge length 4 units.\nSurface area = √3 * (4)^2 = 16√3 square units\n\nIteration 2: We remove 4 tetrahedrons with edge length 2 units.\nSurface area = 4 * (√3 * (2)^2) = 16√3 square units\n\nIteration 3: We remove 16 tetrahedrons with edge length 1 unit.\nSurface area = 16 * (√3 * (1)^2) = 16√3 square units\n\nIteration 4: We remove 64 tetrahedrons with edge length 0.5 units.\nSurface area = 64 * (√3 * (0.5)^2) = 16√3 square units\n\nNow, let's add up the surface area of all the removed tetrahedrons:\n\nTotal surface area = 16√3 + 16√3 + 16√3 + 16√3 = 64√3 square units\n\nSo, the total surface area of all the removed tetrahedrons after 4 iterations is 64√3 square units."
