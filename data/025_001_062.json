    "message_2": "To use Bezout's theorem, we need to find the degrees of the two curves and multiply them. The degree of a curve is the highest degree of its terms. In this case, both curves are of degree 2:\n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 - 25 = 0 (degree 2)\nC2: x^2 - 8x + y^2 - 6y - 12 = 0 (degree 2)\n\nNow, we multiply the degrees of the two curves: 2 * 2 = 4. According to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of two curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity, assuming that the curves are in general position and have no common components.\n\nSo, there are potentially 4 intersection points between C1 and C2. However, we need to check if there are any common components or if the curves are not in general position.\n\nIn this case, both curves are circles, and they do not share any common components. Thus, the two circles can intersect at a maximum of 4 points.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that circles can intersect at 0, 1, 2, or 4 points. In this specific case, we can see that the circles intersect at 2 points by solving the system of equations:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - 25 = 0\nx^2 - 8x + y^2 - 6y - 12 = 0\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n-8x - 6y - 12 + 25 = 0\n-8x - 6y + 13 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (8x + 13)/6\n\nSubstitute this expression for y back into the first equation:\n\nx^2 + ((8x + 13)/6)^2 - 25 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for x, we get two real solutions: x ≈ 2.114 and x ≈ 5.886. For each x value, we can find the corresponding y value using the expression for y:\n\ny ≈ (8(2.114) + 13)/6 ≈ 4.553\ny ≈ (8(5.886) + 13)/6 ≈ 1.447\n\nSo, the two intersection points are approximately (2.114, 4.553) and (5.886, 1.447). Therefore, the number of intersection points of C1 and C2 is 2."
