The total profit from one cow per year is $1,000. However, each additional cow that grazes on the land beyond its limit causes $1,000 of environmental degradation to the land. Assuming that the group of farmers is rational and selfish, how many cows will each farmer graze on the common land?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be approached using the concept of the tragedy of the commons. Since the farmers are rational and selfish, they will try to maximize their individual profit without considering the environmental degradation cost.\n\nThe total capacity of the common land is 100 acres * 15 cows per acre = 1500 cows. If each farmer tries to maximize their profit, they will graze as many cows as possible on the common land.\n\nSince there are 10 farmers, they will divide the total capacity of 1500 cows equally among themselves. So, each farmer will graze 1500 cows / 10 farmers = 150 cows on the common land.\n\nHowever, this will lead to overgrazing and environmental degradation. The cost of this degradation will be shared among all the farmers, so each farmer will bear 1/10th of the total cost. Since each additional cow beyond the limit causes $1,000 of environmental degradation, the cost of degradation per cow for each farmer is $1,000 / 10 = $100.\n\nNow, let's find the point where the profit from grazing one more cow is equal to the cost of environmental degradation caused by that cow. The profit from one cow is $1,000, and the cost of degradation per cow is $100. So, the profit from grazing one more cow will be equal to the cost of degradation when the profit is $1,000 - $100 = $900.\n\nTo find the number of cows at which this occurs, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$1,000 * x - $100 * (x - 1) = $900 * x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 10\n\nSo, each farmer will graze 10 cows on the common land to maximize their profit while considering the cost of environmental degradation."
