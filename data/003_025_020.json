    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet Vb represent the boat's velocity (20 km/h to the east) and Vw represent the wind's velocity (10 km/h to the north). We want to find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity Vr.\n\nFirst, we find the magnitude of the resultant velocity Vr using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nVr = √(Vb^2 + Vw^2)\nVr = √(20^2 + 10^2)\nVr = √(400 + 100)\nVr = √500\nVr ≈ 22.36 km/h\n\nNow, we find the direction of the resultant velocity Vr using trigonometry. We can use the tangent function to find the angle θ between the east direction and the resultant velocity:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(θ) = Vw / Vb\ntan(θ) = 10 / 20\ntan(θ) = 0.5\n\nNow, we find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arctan(0.5)\nθ ≈ 26.57°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the ground is approximately 22.36 km/h, and the direction is approximately 26.57° north of east."
