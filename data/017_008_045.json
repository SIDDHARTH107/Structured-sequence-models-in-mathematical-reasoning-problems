    "message_2": "a) If G has an element of order 8, let's call it a. Then the elements of G can be written as {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}. Since a has order 8, a^8 = e, and all powers of a are distinct. Therefore, G is generated by a single element, making it a cyclic group. We can define an isomorphism φ: G → C8 by φ(a^i) = i, where i is an integer modulo 8. This is a bijection and preserves the group operation, so G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nb) If G has no element of order 8 but has exactly one element of order 4, let's call it b. Then b^4 = e, and b^2 has order 2. Let's call another element of order 2 in G as c, with c ≠ b^2. Now, consider the element d = bc. Since G is a group, d is also in G. We have d^2 = (bc)^2 = bcbc. Since b^2 and c have order 2, we get bcbc = b^3. Now, d^4 = (b^3)^2 = b^6 = b^2 ≠ e, so d has order greater than 4. But G has no element of order 8, so d must have order 4. Since there is only one element of order 4 in G, we have d = b. Thus, G is generated by b and c, where b has order 4 and c has order 2. This is the presentation of the dihedral group D4, so G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nc) If G has no element of order 8 and no element of order 4, then all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let's call these elements a, b, c, d, e, and f. Since G is a group, the product of any two elements must also be in G. Let's consider the product ab. Since a and b have order 2, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = e. Thus, ab has order 2, and it must be one of the non-identity elements, say c. Similarly, we can show that ac = d, ad = e, and ae = f. Now, bc = a, bd = f, and be = e. Finally, we have cd = b, ce = a, and cf = d. This is the presentation of the quaternion group Q8, so G is isomorphic to Q8."
