    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. Perfect numbers can be represented by the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers.\n\nThe first five perfect numbers are generated by the following prime pairs (p, 2^p - 1):\n\n(2, 3) -> 6\n(3, 7) -> 28\n(5, 31) -> 496\n(7, 127) -> 8128\n(13, 8191) -> 33,550,336\n\nTo find the 6th perfect number, we need to find the next prime pair. The next prime number after 13 is 17, and 2^17 - 1 = 131,071, which is also prime. Therefore, the 6th perfect number is:\n\n2^(17-1) * (2^17 - 1) = 65,536 * 131,071 = 8,589,869,056"
