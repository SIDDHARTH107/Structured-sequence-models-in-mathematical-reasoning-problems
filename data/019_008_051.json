The manufacturer has determined that an ink cartridge containing less than 75% of its ink is empty. Using fuzzy logic, determine how much ink is needed for a cartridge to be considered \"full\".",
    "message_2": "In fuzzy logic, we deal with degrees of truth rather than absolute true or false values. To determine how much ink is needed for a cartridge to be considered \"full\" using fuzzy logic, we can create a membership function that represents the degree of fullness for ink cartridges.\n\nLet's define a simple linear membership function for the fullness of ink cartridges:\n\n- If the ink level is less than 75%, the degree of fullness is 0 (completely empty).\n- If the ink level is 100%, the degree of fullness is 1 (completely full).\n- For ink levels between 75% and 100%, the degree of fullness increases linearly from 0 to 1.\n\nUsing this membership function, we can determine the ink level at which a cartridge is considered \"full\" by finding the point where the degree of fullness is greater than or equal to a certain threshold. Let's say we consider a cartridge to be \"full\" if its degree of fullness is greater than or equal to 0.8.\n\nTo find this point, we can use the linear equation for the membership function:\n\nDegree of fullness = (Ink level - 75) / (100 - 75)\n\nWe want to find the ink level where the degree of fullness is 0.8:\n\n0.8 = (Ink level - 75) / 25\n\nNow, we can solve for the ink level:\n\nInk level - 75 = 0.8 * 25\nInk level - 75 = 20\nInk level = 95\n\nSo, using fuzzy logic and the given membership function, a cartridge would be considered \"full\" if it contains at least 95% of its ink."
