    "message_1": "Suppose you have a knapsack with a total weight capacity of 15 pounds. You have a set of items with the following weights and values:\n\nItem 1: weight 5 pounds, value $10\nItem 2: weight 3 pounds, value $7\nItem 3: weight 7 pounds, value $12\nItem 4: weight 2 pounds, value $5\n\nWhat is the maximum value you can obtain by filling the knapsack using these items?",
    "message_2": "This is a classic example of the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming. We will create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items and a knapsack of capacity j.\n\nLet's create a table dp[i][j] where i ranges from 0 to 4 (number of items + 1) and j ranges from 0 to 15 (knapsack capacity + 1).\n\nThe base case is when there are no items (i = 0) or the knapsack capacity is 0 (j = 0), the maximum value is 0.\n\nFor each item i, we have two options: either we include the item in the knapsack or we don't.\n\nIf we include the item, the maximum value will be the value of the item plus the maximum value that can be obtained using the remaining capacity (j - weight of the item) and the previous items (i - 1).\n\nIf we don't include the item, the maximum value will be the maximum value that can be obtained using the same capacity and the previous items (i - 1).\n\nWe will choose the maximum of these two options for each cell in the table.\n\nAfter filling the table, the maximum value that can be obtained using all items and the given knapsack capacity will be stored in dp[4][15].\n\nHere's the filled table:\n\n```\n  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n0 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n1 0  0  0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n2 0  0  0  7  7 10 10 10 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17\n3 0  0  0  7  7 10 10 12 17 17 19 19 19 24 24 24\n4 0  0  5  7  7 10 12 12 17 19 19 22 24 24 24 29\n```\n\nThe maximum value that can be obtained is 29 (located at dp[4][15])."
