    "message_1": "A certain type of electronic device has a known probability of 0.02 of failing during its expected lifetime. If a company produces 5000 of these devices, what is the probability that at least 100 of these devices will fail during their expected lifetimes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (failures in this case) in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (failure) on a single trial (0.02 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (5000 devices)\n- k is the number of successes (failures)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 100 devices will fail, which means we need to find the probability of 100 or more failures. To do this, we can find the probability of 0 to 99 failures and subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, P(X >= 100) = 1 - P(X < 100) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] for k = 0 to 99.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 99 and sum them up:\n\nΣ[P(X = k)] = Σ[C(5000, k) * (0.02)^k * (0.98)^(5000-k)] for k = 0 to 99\n\nThis calculation involves large numbers and is best done using a computer or calculator with a built-in binomial probability function. Using a calculator or software, we get:\n\nΣ[P(X = k)] ≈ 0.1334\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 100 failures:\n\nP(X >= 100) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] ≈ 1 - 0.1334 ≈ 0.8666\n\nSo, the probability that at least 100 devices will fail during their expected lifetimes is approximately 0.8666 or 86.66%."
