    "message_1": "A cyclist starts at the origin and travels at a constant speed of 10 m/s. How far have they traveled after 6 seconds? Use the mean value theorem to find the maximum speed of the cyclist over the given interval.",
    "message_2": "Since the cyclist is traveling at a constant speed of 10 m/s, we can use the formula for distance:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 10 m/s and the time is 6 seconds.\n\nDistance = 10 m/s × 6 s = 60 meters\n\nNow, let's use the Mean Value Theorem. The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, our function is the position function of the cyclist, which is given by:\n\ns(t) = 10t\n\nwhere s(t) represents the position of the cyclist at time t.\n\nThe average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 6] is:\n\n(Δs)/(Δt) = (s(6) - s(0))/(6 - 0)\n\nSince s(t) = 10t, we have:\n\ns(6) = 10 × 6 = 60\ns(0) = 10 × 0 = 0\n\nSo, the average rate of change is:\n\n(Δs)/(Δt) = (60 - 0)/(6 - 0) = 60/6 = 10 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of the position function, which represents the speed of the cyclist:\n\ns'(t) = d(10t)/dt = 10\n\nSince the speed is constant, the derivative is also constant, and it is equal to 10 m/s. Therefore, the maximum speed of the cyclist over the given interval is 10 m/s, which is the same as the average speed."
