    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0 for the complex roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (Δ):\n\nΔ = b^2 - 4ac\nΔ = 4^2 - 4(1)(13)\nΔ = 16 - 52\nΔ = -36\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we know that the equation has complex roots.\n\nNow, we can plug the values of a, b, and Δ into the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2(1)\nz = (-4 ± √(36 * -1)) / 2\nz = (-4 ± 6i) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify:\n\nz = -2 ± 3i\n\nSo, the complex roots of the equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0 are:\n\nz = -2 + 3i and z = -2 - 3i"
