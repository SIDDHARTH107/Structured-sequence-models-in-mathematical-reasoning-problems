    "message_2": "To find the box-counting dimension of the Lévy C curve, we can use the Hutchinson formula for self-similar sets. The formula is given by:\n\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\log N}{-\\log r},\n$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the box-counting dimension, $N$ is the number of self-similar pieces, and $r$ is the scaling factor.\n\nIn this case, the Lévy C curve is formed by 3 self-similar pieces ($N = 3$), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 1/3 ($r = 1/3$). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\log 3}{-\\log (1/3)}.\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the dimension:\n\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\log 3}{\\log 3 - 0} = 1 + \\log_3 3 = 2.\n$$\n\nSo, the box-counting dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 2.00."
