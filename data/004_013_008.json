    "message_1": "A company produces and sells its products at a price of $10 per unit. The total cost of producing \"x\" units is given by the function C(x) = 2x^2 + 10x + 100. \nWhat is the minimum number of units the company needs to produce in order to achieve maximum profit? \nHint: Profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue, which is the product of the price and the number of units sold.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we first need to find the profit function, P(x), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. The total revenue is given by the price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold, which is 10x. So, the profit function is:\n\nP(x) = 10x - (2x^2 + 10x + 100)\n\nNow, we simplify the profit function:\n\nP(x) = 10x - 2x^2 - 10x - 100\nP(x) = -2x^2 + 100\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the profit function. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = -2 and b = 0 (since there is no x term in the simplified profit function). So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\nx = -0 / (2 * -2)\nx = 0\n\nSince the x-coordinate of the vertex is 0, the minimum number of units the company needs to produce in order to achieve maximum profit is 0. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the company needs to produce and sell products to make a profit.\n\nTo find the minimum number of units the company needs to produce for a positive profit, we need to find the value of x for which P(x) > 0. We can set up the inequality:\n\n-2x^2 + 100 > 0\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\nx^2 - 50 < 0\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which the inequality holds true. Since the parabola opens upwards, the inequality will be true between the two x-intercepts. To find the x-intercepts, we set P(x) = 0:\n\nx^2 - 50 = 0\n\nThis is a difference of squares, so we can factor it as:\n\n(x - √50)(x + √50) = 0\n\nThe x-intercepts are x = √50 and x = -√50. Since we cannot have a negative number of units, the minimum number of units the company needs to produce in order to achieve maximum profit is the smallest integer greater than √50, which is:\n\nx = ceil(√50) = ceil(7.07) = 8 units."
