    "message_1": "A survey of 1000 adults showed that 20% of them had a certain medical condition. If a doctor randomly selects 50 adults for a medical study, what is the probability that exactly 10 of them will have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of adults selected for the study)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of adults with the medical condition)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an adult having the medical condition)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 50 (the number of adults selected for the study)\n- k = 10 (the number of adults with the medical condition)\n- p = 0.20 (the probability of an adult having the medical condition, given by the survey)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate nCk, which is given by the formula:\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n50C10 = 50! / (10!(50-10)!)\n      = 50! / (10!40!)\n      = 10272278170\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = (50C10) * (0.20^10) * (0.80^40)\n          = 10272278170 * (0.20^10) * (0.80^40)\n          ≈ 0.2704\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 of the 50 adults selected for the study will have the medical condition is approximately 0.2704 or 27.04%."
