    "message_1": "A factory needs to transport 4000 units of product from Location A to Location B. There are 3 possible routes they can take, each with a different capacity and cost per unit. Route 1 has a capacity of 1200 units at a cost of $5 per unit, Route 2 has a capacity of 1800 units at a cost of $6 per unit, and Route 3 has a capacity of 2200 units at a cost of $8 per unit. Determine the optimal combination of routes the factory should take to minimize transportation costs and meet the demand.",
    "message_2": "To minimize transportation costs, we should prioritize using the routes with the lowest cost per unit. In this case, Route 1 has the lowest cost per unit at $5, followed by Route 2 at $6, and Route 3 at $8.\n\nFirst, let's use Route 1 to its full capacity:\n1200 units * $5 = $6000\n\nNow we still need to transport 4000 - 1200 = 2800 units.\n\nNext, let's use Route 2 to its full capacity:\n1800 units * $6 = $10,800\n\nNow we still need to transport 2800 - 1800 = 1000 units.\n\nFinally, we will use Route 3 for the remaining 1000 units:\n1000 units * $8 = $8000\n\nThe total transportation cost is:\n$6000 (Route 1) + $10,800 (Route 2) + $8000 (Route 3) = $25,800\n\nSo, the optimal combination of routes to minimize transportation costs is to use Route 1 for 1200 units, Route 2 for 1800 units, and Route 3 for 1000 units, with a total cost of $25,800."
