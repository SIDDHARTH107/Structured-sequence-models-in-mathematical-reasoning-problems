    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: product A and product B. The production process for each product requires labor and materials, which the company has limited availability of. The labor and material requirements per unit and the availability are as follows:\n\nProduct | Labor Required (hours) | Material Required (pounds) | Labor Available (hours) | Material Available (pounds)\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nA | 4 | 6 | 80 | 120\nB | 6 | 4 | 60 | 100\n\nProduct A sells for $10 per unit and product B sells for $8 per unit. The company wants to maximize its revenue, subject to the constraint of the limited availability of labor and materials.\n\nWhat is the maximum revenue that the company can earn? How many units of each product should be produced to achieve this maximum revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The company wants to maximize its revenue, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nRevenue = 10x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 80 (Labor constraint)\n6x + 4y ≤ 120 (Material constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\n\ny ≤ (80 - 4x) / 6\ny ≤ (120 - 6x) / 4\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ (80 - 4x) / 6\n2. y ≤ (120 - 6x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. To find the vertices of the feasible region, we will find the points of intersection of the constraints:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\n\n(80 - 4x) / 6 = (120 - 6x) / 4\n80 - 4x = 180 - 9x\n5x = 100\nx = 20\n\ny = (120 - 6x) / 4 = (120 - 6*20) / 4 = 60 / 4 = 15\n\nSo, the point of intersection is (20, 15).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 0): Revenue = 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. (20, 0): Revenue = 10(20) + 8(0) = $200\n3. (0, 20): Revenue = 10(0) + 8(20) = $160\n4. (20, 15): Revenue = 10(20) + 8(15) = $200 + $120 = $320\n\nThe maximum revenue is $320, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of product A and 15 units of product B."
