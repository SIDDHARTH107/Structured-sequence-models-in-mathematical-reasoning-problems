    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and the following degree sequence: 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Is this degree sequence possible? Justify your answer.",
    "message_2": "To determine if this degree sequence is possible, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the Havel-Hakimi algorithm.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18, which is an even number. This means that the graph could potentially exist.\n\nNext, we can apply the Havel-Hakimi algorithm, which is a method for testing whether a given degree sequence is graphical (i.e., if there exists a graph with that degree sequence). The algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Sort the degree sequence in non-increasing order.\n2. Remove the first number (N) from the sequence.\n3. Subtract 1 from the next N numbers in the sequence.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the sequence is empty or a contradiction is found.\n\nApplying the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to our degree sequence:\n\n1. The sequence is already sorted: 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1\n2. Remove the first number (4): 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1\n3. Subtract 1 from the next 4 numbers: 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1\n4. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1\n5. Remove the first number (2): 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n6. Subtract 1 from the next 2 numbers: 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n7. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0\n8. Remove the first number (1): 1, 1, 1, 1, 0\n9. Subtract 1 from the next 1 number: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0\n10. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: 1, 1, 1, 0, 0\n11. Remove the first number (1): 1, 1, 0, 0\n12. Subtract 1 from the next 1 number: 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nThe sequence is now empty, and we did not encounter any contradictions (i.e., negative numbers). Therefore, the given degree sequence is possible, and there exists a graph with this degree sequence."
