What is the shortest possible route he or she can take, starting and ending at the same city and visiting each other city exactly once? The distances between the cities are: \n\n- City A to City B: 10 miles \n- City A to City C: 6 miles \n- City A to City D: 8 miles \n- City A to City E: 15 miles \n- City B to City C: 20 miles \n- City B to City D: 18 miles \n- City B to City E: 25 miles \n- City C to City D: 14 miles \n- City C to City E: 12 miles \n- City D to City E: 16 miles \n\nWhat is the total distance of the shortest route?",
