    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x/(2-x) on the interval -3 < x < 3, we first need to extend the function to be periodic with period L = 6. Let's call this periodic extension g(x). Note that g(x) = g(x + 6n) for any integer n.\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series of g(x) in the form:\n\ng(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients given by:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[g(x) dx] from -L/2 to L/2\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[g(x) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L/2 to L/2\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[g(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L/2 to L/2\n\nFor the given function and interval, L = 6, and we have:\n\na_0 = (1/6) * ∫[x/(2-x) dx] from -3 to 3\n\nSince the function is odd, the integral over the symmetric interval will be zero:\n\na_0 = 0\n\nNow let's find the coefficients a_n and b_n:\n\na_n = (2/6) * ∫[x/(2-x) * cos(n * π * x / 6) dx] from -3 to 3\n\nAgain, since the function x/(2-x) is odd and cos(n * π * x / 6) is even, their product is odd, and the integral over the symmetric interval will be zero:\n\na_n = 0\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (2/6) * ∫[x/(2-x) * sin(n * π * x / 6) dx] from -3 to 3\n\nThis integral is not trivial to solve analytically, so we will leave it in its current form:\n\nb_n = (1/3) * ∫[x/(2-x) * sin(n * π * x / 6) dx] from -3 to 3\n\nThus, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x/(2-x) on the interval -3 < x < 3 is given by:\n\ng(x) = Σ [(1/3) * ∫[x/(2-x) * sin(n * π * x / 6) dx] from -3 to 3 * sin(n * π * x / 6)]\n\nKeep in mind that this Fourier series converges to the given function f(x) = x/(2-x) on the interval -3 < x < 3, but it represents the periodic extension g(x) outside of this interval."
