    "message_2": "To find the volume of the frustum, we will first find the volume of the larger cone and then subtract the volume of the smaller cone.\n\nLet's denote the height of the larger cone as H1 and the radius of its base as R1. Similarly, let the height of the smaller cone be H2 and the radius of its base be R2.\n\nGiven: H1 = 10 cm, R1 = 5 cm, H2 = 4 cm, and R2 = 3 cm.\n\nThe volume of a cone can be found using the formula V = (1/3)πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius of the base, and h is the height.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the larger cone (V1):\n\nV1 = (1/3)π(R1^2)(H1)\nV1 = (1/3)π(5^2)(10)\nV1 = (1/3)π(25)(10)\nV1 = (250/3)π cm^3\n\nNow, we need to find the volume of the smaller cone (V2):\n\nV2 = (1/3)π(R2^2)(H2)\nV2 = (1/3)π(3^2)(4)\nV2 = (1/3)π(9)(4)\nV2 = (36/3)π cm^3\nV2 = 12π cm^3\n\nFinally, we will find the volume of the frustum (Vf) by subtracting the volume of the smaller cone from the volume of the larger cone:\n\nVf = V1 - V2\nVf = (250/3)π - 12π\nVf = (250/3 - 36)π cm^3\nVf = (250 - 108)/3π cm^3\nVf = 142/3π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the frustum is (142/3)π cm^3."
