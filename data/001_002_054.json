    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (4, 9), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation, which is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is a point on the line and m is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (2, 5) and (4, 9), we can plug in the values:\n\nm = (9 - 5) / (4 - 2)\nm = 4 / 2\nm = 2\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either point to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (2, 5):\n\ny - 5 = 2(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ny - 5 = 2x - 4\n\nAdd 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\ny = 2x + 1\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (4, 9) is:\n\ny = 2x + 1"
