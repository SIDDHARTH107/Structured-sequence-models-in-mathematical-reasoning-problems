    "message_2": "For a second-order reaction, the rate law is given by:\n\nrate = k[A][B]\n\nSince the reaction is A + B -> C, the stoichiometry is 1:1. Therefore, the change in concentration of A and B will be the same at any given time. Let x be the change in concentration of A and B at any time t. Then, the concentrations of A and B at time t will be (1.0 - x) M.\n\nNow, we can write the rate law in terms of x:\n\nrate = k(1.0 - x)(1.0 - x)\n\nWe are given that the concentration of the reactants should decrease to half of their initial values. So, when x = 0.5 M, the concentrations of A and B will be 0.5 M each.\n\nNow, we can use the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction:\n\n1/([A]t - [A]0) = kt\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of A at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of A, and k is the rate constant.\n\nWe have [A]t = 0.5 M, [A]0 = 1.0 M, and k = 2.5 L/mol * min. Plugging these values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\n1/(0.5 - 1.0) = 2.5t\n\nSolving for t:\n\n-1/0.5 = 2.5t\n\nt = -1/(2.5 * 0.5)\n\nt = 0.8 min\n\nSo, it takes 0.8 minutes for the concentration of the reactants to decrease to half of their initial values."
