    "message_2": "To prove that the function d : X × X → R defined by d(x, y) = d(x, y) is a metric on X, we need to show that it satisfies the three properties of a metric:\n\n1. Non-negativity: d(x, y) ≥ 0 for all x, y ∈ X, and d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y.\n2. Symmetry: d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X.\n3. Triangle inequality: d(x, y) + d(y, z) ≥ d(x, z) for all x, y, z ∈ X.\n\nLet's prove each property:\n\n1. Non-negativity:\n\nSince d is a metric on X, we know that d(x, a) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ X and a ∈ A. Therefore, the infimum of the set {d(x, a): a ∈ A} is also non-negative. Hence, d(x, A) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ X and A ⊆ X.\n\nNow, let x = y. Then, d(x, y) = d(x, x) = 0, since d is a metric on X. Conversely, if d(x, y) = 0, then d(x, y) = inf {d(x, a): a ∈ A} = 0. Since d(x, a) ≥ 0 for all a ∈ A, this implies that d(x, y) = 0, and thus x = y.\n\n2. Symmetry:\n\nLet x, y ∈ X. Then, d(x, y) = inf {d(x, a): a ∈ A} and d(y, x) = inf {d(y, a): a ∈ A}. Since d is a metric on X, we know that d(x, a) = d(a, x) for all a ∈ A. Therefore, the sets {d(x, a): a ∈ A} and {d(y, a): a ∈ A} are the same, and their infimums are equal. Hence, d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X.\n\n3. Triangle inequality:\n\nLet x, y, z ∈ X. We want to show that d(x, y) + d(y, z) ≥ d(x, z). Let ε > 0 be arbitrary. Since d(x, y) = inf {d(x, a): a ∈ A}, there exists a ∈ A such that d(x, a) ≤ d(x, y) + ε/2. Similarly, since d(y, z) = inf {d(y, b): b ∈ A}, there exists b ∈ A such that d(y, b) ≤ d(y, z) + ε/2.\n\nNow, using the triangle inequality for the metric d on X, we have:\n\nd(x, z) ≤ d(x, a) + d(a, y) + d(y, b) + d(b, z).\n\nSince a, b ∈ A, we have d(x, z) ≤ d(x, y) + ε/2 + d(y, z) + ε/2 = d(x, y) + d(y, z) + ε.\n\nSince ε > 0 is arbitrary, we have d(x, z) ≤ d(x, y) + d(y, z) for all x, y, z ∈ X.\n\nThus, the function d : X × X → R defined by d(x, y) = d(x, y) satisfies all three properties of a metric, and therefore it is a metric on X."
