    "message_2": "To find the sum of two points $Q$ and $R$ on an elliptic curve $E$, we need to find the line that passes through $Q$ and $R$ and then find the third point of intersection of that line with the curve $E$. Finally, we reflect that point over the x-axis to obtain the sum $Q + R$.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope of the line passing through $Q$ and $R$. The slope $m$ is given by:\n\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-1 - 3}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-4}{-3} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the line passing through $Q$ and $R$ using the point-slope form:\n\n$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of point $Q$ and the slope $m$, we get:\n\n$$y - 3 = \\frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the third point of intersection of this line with the elliptic curve $E$. To do this, we substitute the expression for $y$ from the line equation into the curve equation:\n\n$$(3 + \\frac{4}{3}(x - 2))^2 = x^3 + x$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{64}{9}x^3 - \\frac{112}{9}x^2 + \\frac{64}{3}x - 7 = 0$$\n\nWe know that the line intersects the curve at points $Q$ and $R$, so the polynomial on the left-hand side must have $x = 2$ and $x = -1$ as roots. Therefore, we can factor the polynomial as:\n\n$$\\frac{64}{9}(x - 2)(x + 1)(x - x_3) = 0$$\n\nwhere $x_3$ is the x-coordinate of the third point of intersection. To find $x_3$, we can divide the polynomial by $(x - 2)(x + 1)$:\n\n$$\\frac{64}{9}(x - x_3) = \\frac{64}{9}x^3 - \\frac{112}{9}x^2 + \\frac{64}{3}x - 7 \\div (x - 2)(x + 1)$$\n\nUsing polynomial long division or synthetic division, we find that:\n\n$$x - x_3 = x - \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nSo, $x_3 = \\frac{1}{4}$. Now, we can find the corresponding y-coordinate $y_3$ by plugging $x_3$ back into the line equation:\n\n$$y_3 = 3 + \\frac{4}{3}(x_3 - 2) = 3 + \\frac{4}{3}(\\frac{1}{4} - 2) = 3 - \\frac{8}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThus, the third point of intersection is $(\\frac{1}{4}, -\\frac{1}{3})$. To find the sum $Q + R$, we need to reflect this point over the x-axis, which means negating the y-coordinate:\n\n$$Q + R = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$"
