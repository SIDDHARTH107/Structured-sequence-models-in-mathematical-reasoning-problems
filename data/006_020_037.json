    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 250 are women and 100 of the women are married. If a person is selected at random from the community, what is the probability that the person selected is a married woman?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a married woman, we need to divide the number of married women by the total number of people in the community.\n\nNumber of married women = 100\nTotal number of people = 500\n\nProbability of selecting a married woman = (Number of married women) / (Total number of people)\n= 100 / 500\n= 1 / 5\n= 0.2\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a married woman is 0.2 or 20%."
