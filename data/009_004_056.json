    "message_1": "A simple mass-spring system has a mass of 0.5 kg and a spring constant of 20 N/m. The system is initially at rest and is displaced 5 cm from its equilibrium position before being released. Find the period and frequency of the resulting oscillations.",
    "message_2": "To find the period (T) and frequency (f) of the oscillations in a mass-spring system, we can use the following formulas:\n\nT = 2π√(m/k)\nf = 1/T\n\nwhere m is the mass (0.5 kg) and k is the spring constant (20 N/m).\n\nFirst, let's find the period T:\n\nT = 2π√(0.5 kg / 20 N/m)\nT = 2π√(0.025)\nT ≈ 2π(0.158)\nT ≈ 0.993 s\n\nNow, let's find the frequency f:\n\nf = 1/T\nf = 1/0.993 s\nf ≈ 1.007 Hz\n\nSo, the period of the oscillations is approximately 0.993 seconds, and the frequency is approximately 1.007 Hz."
