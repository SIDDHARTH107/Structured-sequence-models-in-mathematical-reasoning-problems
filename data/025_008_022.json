The Hodge decomposition theorem states that the space of harmonic forms is isomorphic to the cohomology groups of the manifold. In our case, we are interested in the second cohomology group, $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{C})$.\n\nThe complex projective plane $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has the cohomology ring structure given by $H^*(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong \\mathbb{C}[H]/(H^3)$, where $H$ is the generator of $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{C})$ and has degree 2. The cohomology groups are:\n\n- $H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$ (generated by the constant function 1)\n- $H^1(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong 0$ (since $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ is simply connected)\n- $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$ (generated by the class $H$)\n- $H^3(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong 0$ (since the complex projective plane has complex dimension 2, and thus real dimension 4)\n\nSince we are interested in the second cohomology group, we have:\n\n$H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of harmonic 2-forms on the complex projective plane is 1."
