    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept of a linear equation, we need to find the value of x when y = 0. So, we will set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = -4x + 12\n\nNow, we will isolate x by adding 4x to both sides of the equation:\n\n4x = 12\n\nNext, we will divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the x-intercept of the linear equation y = -4x + 12 is x = 3."
