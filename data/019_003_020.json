    "message_1": "Unfortunately, modal logic is not a topic that lends itself well to numerical problems. Modal logic deals with reasoning about concepts such as necessity, possibility, and contingency, which are not quantifiable in the same way that numerical problems in mathematics typically are. Instead, students of modal logic are typically presented with arguments or scenarios and asked to evaluate their validity or soundness using the tools and concepts of modal logic.",
    "message_2": "I understand that modal logic is not a numerical problem, and I apologize for any confusion. If you have a specific question or scenario related to modal logic, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to help you with that."
