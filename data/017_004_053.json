    "message_2": "First, let's clarify that 25 is not a prime number, but rather a square of a prime number (5^2). However, we can still analyze the possible number of distinct groups of order 25.\n\nLet G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup, say P. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 25\n\nThe only possibility for n_5 is 1, which means that G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, and this subgroup is normal in G. Let P be this normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Since P has order 5, which is prime, P is cyclic, and we can write P = ⟨a⟩, where a has order 5.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since |G| = 25 and |P| = 5, we have |G/P| = 5. Since 5 is prime, G/P is cyclic, and we can write G/P = ⟨bP⟩, where bP has order 5.\n\nNow, we will show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩ and |g| = 25. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 25.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic\nIf G is not cyclic, then there is no element in G with order 25. We know that G is generated by the elements a and b, where a has order 5 and bP has order 5 in G/P. Since P is normal in G, we can consider the element ab. We have:\n\n(ab)^5 = a^5 * b^5 = e * b^5\n\nSince a has order 5 and G is not cyclic, b cannot have order 25. Therefore, b must have order 5. Then, (ab)^5 = e * b^5 = e, which means that ab has order 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the set H = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b, a^4b}. We will show that H is a subgroup of G. Notice that:\n\n1. H is closed under the group operation: The product of any two elements in H is also in H.\n2. H contains the identity element e.\n3. H contains the inverse of each element: For any element x in H, its inverse x^(-1) is also in H.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G and |H| = 10, we have |G/H| = 25/10 = 2.5, which is not an integer. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that G is not cyclic must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, G must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
