    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = 4(∂^2u/∂x^2) + 2(∂^2u/∂y^2)\n\nwhere u(x,y,t) is the temperature distribution on a thin metallic plate with dimensions x ∈ [0,2] and y ∈ [0,1] at time t ≥ 0. The initial temperature distribution is given by u(x,y,0) = sin(πx)cos(πy).\n\nFind the temperature distribution on the metallic plate at time t = 0.5 seconds using the method of separation of variables. Then, plot the temperature distribution for x ∈ [0,2] and y ∈ [0,1] using MATLAB.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = 4X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + 2X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by XYT:\n\n(1/T)dT/dt = 4(1/X)X'' + 2(1/Y)Y''\n\nLet's set each side equal to a separation constant, -λ:\n\n(1/T)dT/dt = -λ\n4(1/X)X'' = -λ\n2(1/Y)Y'' = -λ\n\nNow, we have three ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n(1) dT/dt = -λT\n(2) X'' = -(λ/4)X\n(3) Y'' = -(λ/2)Y\n\nSolving (1) gives:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-λt)\n\nSolving (2) with boundary conditions X(0) = X(2) = 0 gives:\n\nX(x) = Dsin(πx/2)\n\nwhere n is an integer. The eigenvalue λ for this solution is:\n\nλ = n^2 * π^2\n\nSolving (3) with boundary conditions Y(0) = Y(1) = 0 gives:\n\nY(y) = Ecos(nπy)\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑(C_n * sin(nπx/2) * cos(nπy) * e^(-n^2 * π^2 * t))\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx)cos(πy):\n\nsin(πx)cos(πy) = ∑(C_n * sin(nπx/2) * cos(nπy))\n\nComparing the terms, we see that C_1 = 1 and all other C_n = 0. So, the solution is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = sin(πx/2) * cos(πy) * e^(-π^2 * t)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 0.5 seconds:\n\nu(x, y, 0.5) = sin(πx/2) * cos(πy) * e^(-π^2 * 0.5)\n\nTo plot this in MATLAB, use the following code:\n\n```MATLAB\n[X, Y] = meshgrid(0:0.01:2, 0:0.01:1);\nu = sin(pi*X/2) .* cos(pi*Y) .* exp(-pi^2 * 0.5);\nsurf(X, Y, u);\nxlabel('x');\nylabel('y');\nzlabel('u(x, y, 0.5)');\ntitle('Temperature Distribution at t = 0.5 seconds');\n```\n\nThis will generate a 3D plot of the temperature distribution u(x, y, 0.5) for x ∈ [0,2] and y ∈ [0,1]."
