    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A∆B) and the intersection of A and B (A∩B).\n\nThe symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, A∆B = (A∪B) - (A∩B).\n\nA∆B = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4} - {2, 3}\nA∆B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3}\nA∆B = {1, 4}\n\nThe intersection of two sets is the set of elements which are common to both sets.\n\nA∩B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection. To prove this, we need to show that (A∆B)∩(A∩B) = (A∆(A∩B))∪(B∆(A∩B)).\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference of A∆(A∩B) and B∆(A∩B):\n\nA∆(A∩B) = {1, 2, 3}∆{2, 3} = {1}\nB∆(A∩B) = {2, 3, 4}∆{2, 3} = {4}\n\nNow let's find the union of these two symmetric differences:\n\n(A∆(A∩B))∪(B∆(A∩B)) = {1}∪{4} = {1, 4}\n\nFinally, let's find the intersection of A∆B and A∩B:\n\n(A∆B)∩(A∩B) = {1, 4}∩{2, 3} = ∅\n\nSince the intersection of A∆B and A∩B is an empty set, it does not equal the union of the symmetric differences (A∆(A∩B))∪(B∆(A∩B)), which is {1, 4}. Therefore, the symmetric difference is not distributive over intersection in this case."
