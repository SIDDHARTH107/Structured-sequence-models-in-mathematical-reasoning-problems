    "message_1": "A committee of six people is to be formed from 4 PhDs, 5 MScs, and 7 BScs. How many ways can the committee be formed if it should have two members with PhD, three members with MSc, and one member with BSc?",
    "message_2": "To form the committee, we need to choose 2 members from the 4 PhDs, 3 members from the 5 MScs, and 1 member from the 7 BScs.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 members from the 4 PhDs can be calculated using combinations: C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6 ways.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 members from the 5 MScs can be calculated using combinations: C(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10 ways.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 member from the 7 BScs can be calculated using combinations: C(7,1) = 7! / (1! * (7-1)!) = 7 ways.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply the number of ways to choose members from each group: 6 ways (PhDs) * 10 ways (MScs) * 7 ways (BScs) = 420 ways.\n\nSo, there are 420 different ways to form the committee with the given requirements."
