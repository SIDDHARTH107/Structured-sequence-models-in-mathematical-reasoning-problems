    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the method of separation of variables, we first try to rewrite the equation in the form:\n\n(dy/dy) / (1 + y^2) = (2t^2 - t*y) dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides of the equation with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫(1 / (1 + y^2)) dy = ∫(2t^2 - t*y) dt\n\nLet's integrate both sides separately:\n\nOn the left side, we have a standard integral:\n\narctan(y) = ∫(1 / (1 + y^2)) dy\n\nOn the right side, we need to integrate each term separately:\n\n∫(2t^2) dt - ∫(t*y) dt\n\nThe first term is easy to integrate:\n\n(2/3)t^3\n\nFor the second term, we treat y as a constant since we are integrating with respect to t:\n\ny * (1/2) * t^2\n\nNow, we combine the results of the integrations:\n\narctan(y) = (2/3)t^3 - (1/2)y*t^2 + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nThis is an implicit solution to the given differential equation. It may not be possible to solve for y explicitly as a function of t, but this equation still represents the general solution to the given differential equation."
