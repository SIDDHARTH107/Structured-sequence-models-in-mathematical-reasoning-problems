    "message_2": "According to the Goldbach Conjecture, every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values, and it has been found to be true in every case. However, the conjecture has not been proven or disproven, so we cannot definitively say that there is no smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."
