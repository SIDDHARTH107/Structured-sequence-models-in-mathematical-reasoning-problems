    "message_2": "The conformal map from the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ onto the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ is given by the Möbius transformation:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - i}{z + i}$$\n\nTo find the map that transforms the points $3$ and $4$ on $\\mathbb{H}$ to $1/2$ and $-1/2$ on $\\mathbb{D}$, we need to find a Möbius transformation $g(z)$ such that:\n\n$$g(3) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$g(4) = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nA Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nWe can plug in the points $3$ and $4$ to get two equations:\n\n$$\\frac{3a + b}{3c + d} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$\\frac{4a + b}{4c + d} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the coefficients $a, b, c,$ and $d$. First, we can multiply the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $4$:\n\n$$3(3a + b) = 3(3c + d)$$\n$$4(4a + b) = -2(4c + d)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$9a + 3b = 9c + 3d$$\n$$16a + 4b = -8c - 2d$$\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n$$7a + b = -17c - 5d$$\n\nLet's solve for $b$:\n\n$$b = -7a + 17c + 5d$$\n\nNow, we can plug this expression for $b$ back into the first equation:\n\n$$9a - 7a + 17c + 5d = 9c + 3d$$\n$$2a + 14c + 5d = 9c + 3d$$\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n$$2a = -5c - 2d$$\n\nWe can choose $a = 1$, which gives us $c = -2/5$ and $d = -1$. Plugging these values back into the expression for $b$, we get $b = 2$. So, the Möbius transformation $g(z)$ is:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{z + 2}{-2z/5 - 1}$$"
