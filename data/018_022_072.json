    "message_1": "Let A = {2, 4, 6, 8} and B = {1, 3, 5, 7}. Find the symmetric difference between A and B using the Cartesian product and show that it is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nSymmetric Difference (A, B) = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nA ∩ B = {} (since A and B have no common elements)\n\nSymmetric Difference (A, B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then the Cartesian product of B and A to show that it is not commutative.\n\nA × B = {(2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (2,7), (4,1), (4,3), (4,5), (4,7), (6,1), (6,3), (6,5), (6,7), (8,1), (8,3), (8,5), (8,7)}\n\nB × A = {(1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (3,8), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8), (7,2), (7,4), (7,6), (7,8)}\n\nAs we can see, the Cartesian product A × B is not equal to the Cartesian product B × A, since the order of the elements in the ordered pairs is different. Therefore, the Cartesian product is not commutative.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the symmetric difference operation itself is commutative, as the order of the sets does not affect the result. In this case, we have:\n\nSymmetric Difference (A, B) = Symmetric Difference (B, A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}"
