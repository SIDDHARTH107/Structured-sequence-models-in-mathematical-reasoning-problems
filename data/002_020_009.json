    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the slice of pizza with a central angle of 60 degrees, we need to find the length of the arc and the two radii of the slice.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 12 inches, the radius is half of that:\n\nRadius = Diameter / 2\nRadius = 12 inches / 2\nRadius = 6 inches\n\nNow, let's find the length of the arc. The circumference of the entire pizza can be found using the formula:\n\nCircumference = 2 * π * Radius\nCircumference = 2 * π * 6 inches\nCircumference ≈ 37.68 inches\n\nSince the central angle of the slice is 60 degrees, we can find the fraction of the pizza's circumference that corresponds to the arc length:\n\nFraction of circumference = (Central angle of slice) / 360 degrees\nFraction of circumference = 60 degrees / 360 degrees\nFraction of circumference = 1/6\n\nNow, we can find the arc length:\n\nArc length = Fraction of circumference * Circumference\nArc length = (1/6) * 37.68 inches\nArc length ≈ 6.28 inches\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the slice by adding the arc length and the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * Radius\nPerimeter = 6.28 inches + 2 * 6 inches\nPerimeter = 6.28 inches + 12 inches\nPerimeter ≈ 18.28 inches\n\nSo, the perimeter of the slice of pizza with a central angle of 60 degrees is approximately 18.28 inches."
