    "message_2": "The order of the subgroup generated by a point $P$ on an elliptic curve $E$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $nP = O$, where $O$ is the point at infinity (the identity element in the group law on $E$) and $nP$ denotes the sum of $P$ added to itself $n$ times.\n\nIn this case, we are given the elliptic curve $E$ with equation $y^2 = x^3 - x$ and the point $P = (0, 0)$. We want to find the order of the subgroup generated by $P$.\n\nFirst, let's check if $P$ is a point of order 2. If $2P = O$, then $P$ is a point of order 2. To compute $2P$, we need to find the tangent line to the curve at $P$. The tangent line can be found by computing the derivative of the curve equation with respect to $x$ and evaluating it at $P$:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2 - 1}{2y}$\n\nAt $P = (0, 0)$, the derivative is undefined, which means the tangent line is vertical. In this case, the vertical line intersects the curve at the point at infinity, so $2P = O$. Therefore, the order of the subgroup generated by $P$ is 2."
