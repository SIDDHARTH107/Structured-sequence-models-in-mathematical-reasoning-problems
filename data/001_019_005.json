    "message_2": "To solve the equation |5x - 3| = 12, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5x - 3 = 12\nTo solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 3 to both sides of the equation:\n5x = 15\n\n2. Divide both sides by 5:\nx = 3\n\nSo, in the first case, x = 3.\n\nCase 2: 5x - 3 = -12\nTo solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 3 to both sides of the equation:\n5x = -9\n\n2. Divide both sides by 5:\nx = -9/5\n\nSo, in the second case, x = -9/5.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for the equation |5x - 3| = 12 are x = 3 and x = -9/5."
