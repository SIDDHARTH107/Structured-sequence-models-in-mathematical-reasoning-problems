    "message_1": "A surface S is represented by the equation z = 2x^3 + 3y^3, find the sectional curvature of S at the point (1, 1, 5).",
    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 1, 5), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\n1. First, find the tangent plane to the surface at the given point. To do this, we need to find the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x and y.\n\n∂z/∂x = 6x^2\n∂z/∂y = 9y^2\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 5), these partial derivatives are:\n\n∂z/∂x = 6(1)^2 = 6\n∂z/∂y = 9(1)^2 = 9\n\n2. Next, find the normal vector to the surface at the given point. The normal vector is given by the gradient of the surface equation:\n\nN = (-∂z/∂x, -∂z/∂y, 1) = (-6, -9, 1)\n\n3. Now, we can find the first fundamental form of the surface. The first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = | E  F |\n    | F  G |\n\nwhere E = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂x> = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2, F = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂y> = ∂z/∂x * ∂z/∂y, and G = <∂r/∂y, ∂r/∂y> = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2.\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 5), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 6^2 = 37\nF = 6 * 9 = 54\nG = 1 + 9^2 = 82\n\nSo the first fundamental form is:\n\nI = | 37  54 |\n    | 54  82 |\n\n4. Next, find the second fundamental form of the surface. The second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = | L  M |\n     | M  N |\n\nwhere L = <∂²r/∂x², N> = ∂²z/∂x², M = <∂²r/∂x∂y, N> = ∂²z/∂x∂y, and N = <∂²r/∂y², N> = ∂²z/∂y².\n\nTo find these values, we need to find the second partial derivatives of the surface equation:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 12x\n∂²z/∂y² = 18y\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 5), we have:\n\nL = 12(1) = 12\nM = 0\nN = 18(1) = 18\n\nSo the second fundamental form is:\n\nII = | 12  0 |\n     |  0 18 |\n\n5. Finally, we can find the sectional curvature K of the surface at the given point. The sectional curvature is given by the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 5), we have:\n\nK = (12 * 18 - 0^2) / (37 * 82 - 54^2) = (216) / (3034 - 2916) = 216 / 118 = 18/7\n\nSo the sectional curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 1, 5) is K = 18/7."
