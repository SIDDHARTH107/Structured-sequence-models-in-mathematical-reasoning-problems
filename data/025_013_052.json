    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we will check all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ values in the field and see if they satisfy the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 5x$.\n\nThe finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We will go through each $x$ value and calculate the corresponding $y^2$ value. If the result is a quadratic residue (i.e., a square) in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, then it corresponds to a valid point on the curve.\n\n1. For $x = 0$: $y^2 = 0^3 + 5\\cdot0 = 0$. This is a valid point, so we have 1 point for $x = 0$.\n2. For $x = 1$: $y^2 = 1^3 + 5\\cdot1 = 6$. The quadratic residues in $\\mathbb{F}_7$ are {0, 1, 2, 4}. Since 6 is not a quadratic residue, there are no points for $x = 1$.\n3. For $x = 2$: $y^2 = 2^3 + 5\\cdot2 = 16 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. This is a quadratic residue, so we have 2 points for $x = 2$.\n4. For $x = 3$: $y^2 = 3^3 + 5\\cdot3 = 54 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$. This is not a quadratic residue, so there are no points for $x = 3$.\n5. For $x = 4$: $y^2 = 4^3 + 5\\cdot4 = 96 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. This is a quadratic residue, so we have 2 points for $x = 4$.\n6. For $x = 5$: $y^2 = 5^3 + 5\\cdot5 = 150 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. This is a quadratic residue, so we have 2 points for $x = 5$.\n7. For $x = 6$: $y^2 = 6^3 + 5\\cdot6 = 276 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. This is a quadratic residue, so we have 2 points for $x = 6$.\n\nNow, we add up the points for each $x$ value: $1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9$. However, we must also include the point at infinity, which is always present on an elliptic curve. Therefore, the total number of points on the elliptic curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ is $9 + 1 = 10$."
