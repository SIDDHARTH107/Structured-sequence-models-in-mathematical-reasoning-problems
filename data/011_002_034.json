    "message_2": "To find the number of different pairs of marbles that can be chosen from the bag, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of marbles (10 in this case) and k is the number of marbles chosen at a time (2 in this case).\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2 * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9)/(2)\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 different pairs of marbles that can be chosen from the bag."
