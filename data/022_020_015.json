    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem, we first find the general solution of the differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + u = 0$\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. We can solve it by assuming a solution of the form:\n\n$u(x) = e^{rx}$\n\nPlugging this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$r^2 e^{rx} + e^{rx} = 0$\n\nFactoring out $e^{rx}$, we get:\n\n$(r^2 + 1)e^{rx} = 0$\n\nSince $e^{rx}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by it:\n\n$r^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n\n$r = \\pm i$\n\nSo the general solution is a linear combination of $e^{ix}$ and $e^{-ix}$, which can be rewritten using Euler's formula as:\n\n$u(x) = A\\cos(x) + B\\sin(x)$\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) $u(0) = 0$:\n\n$0 = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0)$\n\n$0 = A$\n\nSo, $A = 0$.\n\n2) $u'(0) = 1$:\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of $u(x)$:\n\n$u'(x) = -A\\sin(x) + B\\cos(x)$\n\nSince $A = 0$, we have:\n\n$u'(x) = B\\cos(x)$\n\nNow we apply the boundary condition:\n\n$1 = B\\cos(0)$\n\n$1 = B$\n\nSo, $B = 1$.\n\nThus, the solution to the boundary value problem on the interval $[0, \\pi/2]$ is:\n\n$u(x) = \\sin(x)$"
