    "message_2": "Step 1: Define the conjugate function\nLet's define a function $g(z)$ as the complex conjugate of $f(z)$, i.e., $g(z) = \\overline{f(z)}$. Since $f(z)$ is real-valued along the real axis, we have $f(z) = \\overline{f(z)}$ for $Im(z) = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Reflect the function\nNow, we want to find an analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the upper half plane. To do this, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle. The principle states that if a function is analytic in a region and continuous up to its boundary, then its reflection across the boundary is also analytic.\n\nIn our case, the boundary is the real axis. So, we want to reflect $f(z)$ across the real axis to obtain an analytic function in the upper half plane. To do this, we can consider the function $h(z) = g(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$.\n\nStep 3: Verify the properties of the reflected function\nWe need to check that $h(z)$ is analytic in the upper half plane and continuous up to the real axis. Since $f(z)$ is analytic in the lower half plane, its conjugate $g(z)$ is also analytic in the lower half plane. Furthermore, since the function $z \\mapsto \\overline{z}$ is analytic, the composition $h(z) = g(\\overline{z})$ is also analytic in the upper half plane.\n\nNow, let's check the continuity of $h(z)$ up to the real axis. For $Im(z) = 0$, we have:\n\n$h(z) = g(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = \\overline{f(z)} = f(z)$\n\nSo, $h(z)$ is continuous up to the real axis.\n\nStep 4: Define the analytic continuation\nNow that we have verified the properties of $h(z)$, we can define the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the upper half plane as follows:\n\n$$\nF(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) & \\text{for } Im(z) \\leq 0 \\\\\nh(z) & \\text{for } Im(z) > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis function $F(z)$ is the desired analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the upper half plane. It is analytic in both the lower and upper half planes and continuous up to the real axis."
