    "message_2": "To calculate the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph and minimize the size of the largest bag minus one. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node (called a bag) is a subset of vertices of the original graph, and it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the original graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the original graph, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the original graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nFor the given graph, we can construct the following tree decomposition:\n\n```\n      {1,2,3}\n     /       \\\n {1,2,4}   {1,3,6}\n   |         |\n {2,4,5}   {3,6,7}\n```\n\nEach bag has a size of 3, so the treewidth of the graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
