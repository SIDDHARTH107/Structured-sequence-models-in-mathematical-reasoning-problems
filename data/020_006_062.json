    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has to minimize the cost of production for a certain product. There are two options of machines available, one costs $3000, can produce 50 units per hour and requires 2 workers. The other machine costs $5000, can produce 80 units per hour and requires 3 workers. The company has 10 workers available and they need to produce at least 800 units in 10 hours. How many machines of each type should they buy to minimize the cost of production?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of machines of the first type and y be the number of machines of the second type.\n\nThe company needs to produce at least 800 units in 10 hours, which means they need to produce at least 80 units per hour. So, the production constraint is:\n\n50x + 80y ≥ 80\n\nThe company has 10 workers available, so the worker constraint is:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 10\n\nWe want to minimize the cost of production, so we need to minimize the cost function:\n\nC(x, y) = 3000x + 5000y\n\nNow we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and minimize the cost function.\n\nFirst, let's solve the worker constraint for y:\n\n3y ≤ 10 - 2x\ny ≤ (10 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow let's find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 50x + 80y ≥ 80\n2. y ≤ (10 - 2x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both constraints are satisfied. Since we're looking for integer values of x and y (number of machines), we can test the integer points in the feasible region to find the minimum cost.\n\nPossible combinations of (x, y) in the feasible region are (1, 2) and (2, 1).\n\nNow let's calculate the cost for each combination:\n\nC(1, 2) = 3000(1) + 5000(2) = 3000 + 10000 = 13000\nC(2, 1) = 3000(2) + 5000(1) = 6000 + 5000 = 11000\n\nThe minimum cost is $11,000 when the company buys 2 machines of the first type and 1 machine of the second type."
