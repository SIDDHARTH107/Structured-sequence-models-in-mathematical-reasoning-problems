    "message_2": "To compute the second Chern class of X, we need to use the Chern classes of the tangent bundle TX. Let's denote the Chern classes of TX as ci(TX), where i = 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nWe are given that the first Chern class of X is c1(X) = 2a. By definition, the first Chern class of X is equal to the first Chern class of the tangent bundle, i.e., c1(X) = c1(TX). Therefore, we have:\n\nc1(TX) = 2a.\n\nNow, we need to compute the second Chern class of X, which is given by c2(X) = c2(TX). To do this, we can use the Chern-Weil formula, which relates the Chern classes of a complex vector bundle to its curvature form. For a complex manifold of dimension n, the second Chern class can be expressed as:\n\nc2(TX) = (1/2) * (c1(TX)^2 - 2 * c1(TX^⊗2)),\n\nwhere TX^⊗2 is the second exterior power of the tangent bundle.\n\nSince X is a complex manifold, we have the following relation between the Chern classes of the tangent bundle and its exterior powers:\n\nc(TX^⊗k) = c(TX)^k,\n\nwhere c(TX) is the total Chern class of the tangent bundle, and k is an integer.\n\nNow, we can compute c1(TX^⊗2) using the above relation:\n\nc1(TX^⊗2) = c1(TX)^2.\n\nSubstituting the given value of c1(TX) into this equation, we get:\n\nc1(TX^⊗2) = (2a)^2 = 4a^2.\n\nNow, we can compute the second Chern class of X using the Chern-Weil formula:\n\nc2(X) = c2(TX) = (1/2) * (c1(TX)^2 - 2 * c1(TX^⊗2))\n       = (1/2) * ((2a)^2 - 2 * 4a^2)\n       = (1/2) * (4a^2 - 8a^2)\n       = (1/2) * (-4a^2)\n       = -2a^2.\n\nSo, the second Chern class of X is c2(X) = -2a^2."
