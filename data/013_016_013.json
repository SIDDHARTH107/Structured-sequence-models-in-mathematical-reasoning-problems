However, the company's manager can exert effort to increase the chance of success, at a cost of $10,000. If the manager exerts effort, the probability of success increases from 50% to 75%. If the manager does not exert effort, the probability of success remains at 50%. What is the manager's optimal decision?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal decision, we need to calculate the expected return for both scenarios: exerting effort and not exerting effort.\n\n1. If the manager does not exert effort:\nThe probability of success is 50%, so the expected return is:\n(0.5 * $50,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $25,000\n\n2. If the manager exerts effort:\nThe probability of success increases to 75%, but there is a cost of $10,000. The expected return is:\n(0.75 * $50,000) + (0.25 * $0) - $10,000 = $37,500 - $10,000 = $27,500\n\nComparing the expected returns:\nNo effort: $25,000\nEffort: $27,500\n\nThe manager's optimal decision is to exert effort, as it results in a higher expected return ($27,500) compared to not exerting effort ($25,000)."
