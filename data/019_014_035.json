    "message_2": "To prove that there exists a number that is both a perfect square and a palindrome, we need to find an example of a number that satisfies both predicates $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$. \n\nConsider the number 9. \n\nFirst, let's check if it is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself. In this case, 9 can be expressed as 3 * 3, so it is a perfect square. Therefore, $P(9)$ is true.\n\nNow, let's check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. In this case, 9 reads the same forward and backward, so it is a palindrome. Therefore, $Q(9)$ is true.\n\nSince both $P(9)$ and $Q(9)$ are true, we can conclude that there exists a number (in this case, 9) that is both a perfect square and a palindrome. In higher-order logic notation, this can be written as:\n\n∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x))\n\nThus, we have proven that there exists a number that is both a perfect square and a palindrome in higher-order logic."
