    "message_2": "To find the keyword of a Vigenère cipher, we need to reverse the encryption process. The Vigenère cipher uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a number of positions based on the corresponding letter in the keyword.\n\nLet's denote the plaintext as P, the ciphertext as C, and the keyword as K. The encryption process can be described as:\n\nC[i] = (P[i] + K[i]) mod 26\n\nTo reverse the process and find the keyword, we can use the following formula:\n\nK[i] = (C[i] - P[i]) mod 26\n\nNow, let's apply this formula to the given ciphertext \"LMALSCQYTFYK\" and plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\":\n\nK[0] = (L - M) mod 26 = (-1) mod 26 = 25 (Z)\nK[1] = (M - A) mod 26 = (12 - 0) mod 26 = 12 (M)\nK[2] = (A - T) mod 26 = (-19) mod 26 = 7 (H)\nK[3] = (L - H) mod 26 = (11 - 7) mod 26 = 4 (E)\nK[4] = (S - M) mod 26 = (18 - 12) mod 26 = 6 (G)\n\nSince the key length is 5, the keyword is \"ZMHEG\"."
