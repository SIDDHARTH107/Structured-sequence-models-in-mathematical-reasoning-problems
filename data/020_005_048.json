    "message_1": "A company produces two products, Product A and Product B, which have profit margins of $30 and $50 per unit respectively. The production of Product A requires 4 labor hours and 2 machine hours, while the production of Product B requires 6 labor hours and 3 machine hours. The company has a labor hour limit of 540 hours and a machine hour limit of 270 hours. How many units of Product A and Product B should the company produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 30x + 50y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n4x + 6y ≤ 540 (labor hours constraint)\n2x + 3y ≤ 270 (machine hours constraint)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint equations for y:\ny ≤ (540 - 4x) / 6\ny ≤ (270 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region by setting the inequalities to equalities and solving for x and y:\n\n1) Intersection of labor hours constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n4x + 6(0) = 540\nx = 135\n\n2) Intersection of labor hours constraint and machine hours constraint:\n4x + 6y = 540\n2x + 3y = 270\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\nx = 90, y = 30\n\n3) Intersection of machine hours constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n2(0) + 3y = 270\ny = 90\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1) P(135, 0) = 30(135) + 50(0) = 4050\n2) P(90, 30) = 30(90) + 50(30) = 2700 + 1500 = 4200\n3) P(0, 90) = 30(0) + 50(90) = 4500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (90, 30), with a profit of $4200. Therefore, the company should produce 90 units of Product A and 30 units of Product B to maximize profit."
