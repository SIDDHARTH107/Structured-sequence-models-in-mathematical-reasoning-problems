    "message_2": "To partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets, we use the Bell number, which is denoted as B(n). The Bell number counts the number of different ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.\n\nFor a set of 8 elements, we want to find B(8). The Bell numbers can be computed using the Bell triangle, which is constructed as follows:\n\n1. The first row has a single entry, B(0) = 1.\n2. To generate the next row, start with the last entry of the previous row and then add the previous entry in the current row to get the next entry.\n\nHere's the Bell triangle for the first few rows:\n\n```\n1\n1  2\n2  3  5\n5  7 10 15\n...\n```\n\nContinuing this process, we can find B(8) by constructing the Bell triangle up to the 9th row:\n\n```\n1\n1   2\n2   3   5\n5   7  10  15\n15  20  27  37  52\n52  67  87 114 155 203\n203 255 322 409 514 677 877\n877 1082 1372 1697 2072 2537 3222 4140\n4140 5060 6182 7507 9122 11017 13307 16687 20552\n```\n\nSo, B(8) = 20552. There are 20,552 ways to partition a set of 8 elements into non-empty subsets."
