    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the stars and bars method. Since each student must receive at least one apple, we can give one apple to each student first. Now we have 6 apples left to distribute among the 4 students without any restrictions.\n\nLet's represent the apples as stars (*) and use bars (|) to separate the portions for each student. We need to place 3 bars among the 6 stars to divide them into 4 groups.\n\nFor example, one possible distribution could be represented as **|*|**|*, which corresponds to giving 2 apples to the first student, 1 apple to the second student, 2 apples to the third student, and 1 apple to the fourth student.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 6 stars and 3 bars. There are a total of 9 positions (6 stars + 3 bars), and we need to choose 3 positions for the bars. This can be done in C(9,3) ways, where C(n,k) denotes the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nC(9,3) = 9! / (3! * (9-3)!) = 9! / (3! * 6!) = 362880 / (6 * 720) = 84\n\nSo there are 84 distinct ways to distribute the 10 identical apples among the 4 different students, with each student receiving at least one apple."
