    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we first need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 - λ & 4 \\\\\n4 & 3 - λ\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)(3 - λ) - 4 * 4 = λ^2 - 6λ + 9 - 16 = λ^2 - 6λ - 7\n\nNow, we solve the quadratic equation λ^2 - 6λ - 7 = 0. The solutions are λ1 = 7 and λ2 = -1, which are the eigenvalues of matrix A.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nFor each eigenvalue, we need to find the corresponding eigenvectors by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 7:\n(A - 7I)v = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-4 & 4 \\\\\n4 & -4\n\\end{pmatrix}v = 0\n\nWe can see that v1 = (1, 1) is an eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 7.\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n(A + I)v = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 4 \\\\\n4 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}v = 0\n\nWe can see that v2 = (1, -1) is an eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = -1.\n\n3. Form the matrix P and D:\nNow, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D with the eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n\nP = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nD = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n7 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n4. Find the inverse of P:\nTo find the inverse of P, we can use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\nP^(-1) = (1/det(P)) * adj(P), where adj(P) is the adjugate of P.\n\ndet(P) = (1 * -1) - (1 * 1) = -2\n\nadj(P) = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nP^(-1) = (-1/2) * adj(P) = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1/2 & 1/2 \\\\\n1/2 & -1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nNow, we have found the invertible matrix P, its inverse P^(-1), and the diagonal matrix D such that A = PDP^(-1)."
