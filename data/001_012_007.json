    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3x^2 + 9x) / (5x^2 + 10x) = 2/5, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.\n(3x^2 + 9x) * 5 = (5x^2 + 10x) * 2\n\nStep 2: Distribute the numbers on both sides of the equation.\n15x^2 + 45x = 10x^2 + 20x\n\nStep 3: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero.\n15x^2 - 10x^2 + 45x - 20x = 0\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation.\n5x^2 + 25x = 0\n\nStep 5: Factor out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the terms.\n5x(x + 5) = 0\n\nStep 6: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.\n5x = 0 or x + 5 = 0\n\nx = 0 or x = -5\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 0 and -5."
