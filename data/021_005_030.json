Define the function for the differential equation: y'(x) = f(x, y) = x - y\n2. Initialize the variables: x0 = 0, y0 = 0, h = 0.1, and n = 10 (since we want to find y(1) and we're taking steps of 0.1)\n3. Implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\nHere's the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\nfor i = 1 to n:\n  k1 = h * f(x0, y0)\n  k2 = h * f(x0 + h/2, y0 + k1/2)\n  k3 = h * f(x0 + h/2, y0 + k2/2)\n  k4 = h * f(x0 + h, y0 + k3)\n  \n  y1 = y0 + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n  x1 = x0 + h\n  \n  Update x0 and y0 with x1 and y1\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\nf(x, y) = x - y\n\ni = 1:\nk1 = 0.1 * (0 - 0) = 0\nk2 = 0.1 * (0.05 - 0) = 0.005\nk3 = 0.1 * (0.05 - 0.0025) = 0.00475\nk4 = 0.1 * (0.1 - 0.00475) = 0.009525\n\ny1 = 0 + (0 + 2*0.005 + 2*0.00475 + 0.009525) / 6 = 0.004958333\nx1 = 0 + 0.1 = 0.1\n\ni = 2:\nk1 = 0.1 * (0.1 - 0.004958333) = 0.009504167\nk2 = 0.1 * (0.15 - 0.004958333 - 0.0047520835) = 0.014045\nk3 = 0.1 * (0.15 - 0.004958333 - 0.0070225) = 0.013819167\nk4 = 0.1 * (0.2 - 0.004958333 - 0.013819167) = 0.0172225\n\ny2 = 0.004958333 + (0.009504167 + 2*0.014045 + 2*0.013819167 + 0.0172225) / 6 = 0.019791667\nx2 = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2\n\nContinue this process until i = 10.\n\nAfter completing the iterations, we find that:\n\ny(1) â‰ˆ 0.515644\n\nSo, using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.1, we approximate the value of y(1) to be approximately 0.515644."
