    "message_2": "To prove that T is a topology on X, we need to show that it satisfies the three axioms of a topology:\n\n1. The empty set and X are elements of T.\n2. The intersection of any finite number of elements of T is an element of T.\n3. The union of any collection of elements of T is an element of T.\n\nBy definition, T contains the empty set and X itself, so the first axiom is satisfied.\n\nNow, let A and B be two elements of T. We need to show that their intersection and union are also elements of T.\n\nIntersection: A ∩ B\nSince A and B are subsets of X, their intersection A ∩ B is also a subset of X. Moreover, since both A and B contain the empty set, their intersection A ∩ B also contains the empty set. Therefore, A ∩ B is an element of T, satisfying the second axiom for a topology.\n\nUnion: A ∪ B\nSince A and B are subsets of X, their union A ∪ B is also a subset of X. Moreover, since both A and B contain the empty set, their union A ∪ B also contains the empty set. If either A or B is equal to X, then A ∪ B is equal to X, which is an element of T. If neither A nor B is equal to X, then A ∪ B is a proper subset of X that contains the empty set, which is also an element of T. Therefore, A ∪ B is an element of T, satisfying the third axiom for a topology.\n\nSince T satisfies all three axioms of a topology, we can conclude that T is a topology on X. Furthermore, we have shown that the intersection and the union of two elements of T are in T."
