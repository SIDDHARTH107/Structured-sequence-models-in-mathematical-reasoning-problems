    "message_2": "The Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is a complex oscillating chemical reaction. To find the maximum concentration of an oscillator in the BZ reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nMaximum concentration = Initial concentration + (Rate of reaction × Reaction time)\n\nGiven the rate of the reaction is 0.5 mol/L·s, the initial concentration of the oscillator is 0.1 mol/L, and the reaction time is 10 seconds, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nMaximum concentration = 0.1 mol/L + (0.5 mol/L·s × 10 s)\n\nMaximum concentration = 0.1 mol/L + (5 mol/L)\n\nMaximum concentration = 5.1 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the maximum concentration of the oscillator in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is 5.1 mol/L."
