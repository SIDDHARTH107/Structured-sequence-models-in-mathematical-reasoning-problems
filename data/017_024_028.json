    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of abelian groups: There are 6 abelian groups of order 96, which can be represented as Z_2^5 x Z_3^1, Z_2^4 x Z_6, Z_2^3 x Z_3 x Z_8, Z_2^2 x Z_3 x Z_16, Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_32, and Z_3 x Z_64.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups: To do this, we can use the formula for the number of groups of order p^n * q^m, where p and q are distinct primes and n and m are their respective powers:\n\n   G(p^n * q^m) = (p^(n^2) - p^n) * (q^(m^2) - q^m) / (p^n - p^(n-1)) * (q^m - q^(m-1))\n\n   In our case, p = 2, n = 5, q = 3, and m = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n   G(2^5 * 3^1) = (2^(5^2) - 2^5) * (3^(1^2) - 3^1) / (2^5 - 2^(5-1)) * (3^1 - 3^(1-1))\n   G(2^5 * 3^1) = (1024 - 32) * (9 - 3) / (32 - 16) * (3 - 1)\n   G(2^5 * 3^1) = 992 * 6 / 16 * 2\n   G(2^5 * 3^1) = 31\n\n4. Subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups: 31 - 6 = 25\n\nThere are 25 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nIn total, there are 6 abelian groups + 25 non-abelian groups = 31 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
