    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.\n\nFor the set A = {1, 2}, we can find its power set as follows:\n\n1. The empty set: {}\n2. The subsets with one element: {1}, {2}\n3. The subset with two elements: {1, 2}\n\nSo, the power set of A is P(A) = { {}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2} }.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the set A and its power set P(A):\n\nThe size of A (denoted as |A|) is 2, since it has two elements: 1 and 2.\n\nThe size of P(A) (denoted as |P(A)|) is 4, since it has four elements: {}, {1}, {2}, and {1, 2}.\n\nSince |P(A)| = 4 and |A| = 2, we can conclude that the size of the power set P(A) is larger than the size of the set A."
