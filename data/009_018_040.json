    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2.\n2. Initialize the initial conditions: x0 = 0, y0 = 1, and step size h = 0.1.\n3. Iterate over the interval [0, 1] using the Runge-Kutta formulas.\n\nThe fourth-order Runge-Kutta method formulas are:\n\nk1 = h * f(x, y)\nk2 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(x + h, y + k3)\ny_new = y + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\nx_new = x + h\n\nLet's apply these formulas to our problem:\n\n1. f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\n2. x0 = 0, y0 = 1, h = 0.1\n\nNow, we will iterate over the interval [0, 1]:\n\nIteration 1 (x = 0):\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0, 1) = 0.1 * (0 + 1) = 0.1\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.05, 1.05) = 0.1 * (0.0025 + 1.1025) = 0.1105\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.05, 1.055) = 0.1 * (0.0025 + 1.112025) = 0.1114025\nk4 = 0.1 * f(0.1, 1.1113) = 0.1 * (0.01 + 1.234569) = 0.1244569\ny1 = 1 + (0.1 + 2*0.1105 + 2*0.1114025 + 0.1244569) / 6 = 1.1113\nx1 = 0 + 0.1 = 0.1\n\nIteration 2 (x = 0.1):\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0.1, 1.1113) = 0.1 * (0.01 + 1.234569) = 0.1244569\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.15, 1.17352845) = 0.1 * (0.0225 + 1.376474) = 0.1398974\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.15, 1.17811345) = 0.1 * (0.0225 + 1.388401) = 0.1410891\nk4 = 0.1 * f(0.2, 1.2469821) = 0.1 * (0.04 + 1.553632) = 0.1593632\ny2 = 1.1113 + (0.1244569 + 2*0.1398974 + 2*0.1410891 + 0.1593632) / 6 = 1.2469821\nx2 = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2\n\nWe will continue this process until x = 1. After completing all iterations, we get:\n\ny(1) ≈ 4.497\n\nThus, the solution of the given differential equation over the interval [0, 1] using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.1 is y(1) ≈ 4.497 (rounded to 3 decimal places)."
