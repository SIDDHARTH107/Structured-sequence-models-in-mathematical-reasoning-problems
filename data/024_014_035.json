Let the vector field $X$ be defined as $X = 3x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - 5z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, where $(x,y,z)$ are the standard coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Determine the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to the vector field $Y=2x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-4z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ evaluated at the point $(1,1,1)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to $Y$, we need to compute the Lie bracket $[Y, X]$. The Lie bracket is defined as:\n\n$[Y, X] = (YX^i - XY^i)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$,\n\nwhere $X^i$ and $Y^i$ are the components of the vector fields $X$ and $Y$, respectively, and the summation over $i$ is implied.\n\nLet's compute the action of $Y$ on the components of $X$:\n\n$Y(3x) = (2x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-4z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(3x) = 6x$\n\n$Y(2y) = (2x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-4z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(2y) = 2y$\n\n$Y(-5z) = (2x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-4z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(-5z) = 20z$\n\nNow let's compute the action of $X$ on the components of $Y$:\n\n$X(2x) = (3x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - 5z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(2x) = 6x$\n\n$X(y) = (3x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - 5z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(y) = 2y$\n\n$X(-4z) = (3x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - 5z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})(-4z) = 20z$\n\nNow we can compute the Lie bracket $[Y, X]$:\n\n$[Y, X] = (YX^i - XY^i)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} = (6x - 6x)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (2y - 2y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + (20z - 20z)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = 0$\n\nSo the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to $Y$ is zero, which means that the vector fields $X$ and $Y$ commute. This result is independent of the point at which it is evaluated, so the Lie derivative at the point $(1,1,1)$ is also zero."
