    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 over the field F_p where p = 11, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can use the following formula to find the number of points on the curve:\n\nN = p + 1 - a\n\nwhere N is the number of points on the curve, p is the prime number (in this case, 11), and a is the trace of Frobenius. The trace of Frobenius can be found using the Hasse's theorem, which states that:\n\n|a| <= 2 * sqrt(p)\n\nWe will now count the number of points on the curve for each x value in the field F_11:\n\n1. For x = 0:\ny^2 = 7\ny = sqrt(7) does not exist in F_11, so there are no points for x = 0.\n\n2. For x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 5*1 + 7 = 13 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(2) does not exist in F_11, so there are no points for x = 1.\n\n3. For x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 5*2 + 7 = 27 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(5) does not exist in F_11, so there are no points for x = 2.\n\n4. For x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 5*3 + 7 = 64 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(9) = 3, 8 (in F_11), so there are 2 points for x = 3.\n\n5. For x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 5*4 + 7 = 103 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(4) = 2, 9 (in F_11), so there are 2 points for x = 4.\n\n6. For x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 5*5 + 7 = 157 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(3) does not exist in F_11, so there are no points for x = 5.\n\n7. For x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 5*6 + 7 = 229 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(1) = 1, 10 (in F_11), so there are 2 points for x = 6.\n\n8. For x = 7:\ny^2 = 7^3 + 5*7 + 7 = 329 ≡ 10 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(10) does not exist in F_11, so there are no points for x = 7.\n\n9. For x = 8:\ny^2 = 8^3 + 5*8 + 7 = 463 ≡ 6 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(6) does not exist in F_11, so there are no points for x = 8.\n\n10. For x = 9:\ny^2 = 9^3 + 5*9 + 7 = 649 ≡ 0 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(0) = 0 (in F_11), so there is 1 point for x = 9.\n\n11. For x = 10:\ny^2 = 10^3 + 5*10 + 7 = 1007 ≡ 8 (mod 11)\ny = sqrt(8) does not exist in F_11, so there are no points for x = 10.\n\nNow, we add the point at infinity. So, the total number of points on the curve is:\n\nN = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8\n\nTherefore, the order of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 over the field F_p where p = 11 is 8."
