    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature using the RSA algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the Euler's totient function φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)\n3. Choose an encryption key e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1\n4. Compute the decryption key d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n5. Compute the digital signature S = H^d (mod n), where H is the hash value of the document\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. n = p * q = 11 * 7 = 77\n2. φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (11-1)(7-1) = 10 * 6 = 60\n3. The encryption key e is already given as 17, and gcd(17, 60) = 1, so it's a valid choice.\n4. To compute the decryption key d, we need to find a number such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)). In other words, we need to find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)). Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 53 (since 53 * 17 ≡ 1 (mod 60)).\n5. Now, we can compute the digital signature S = H^d (mod n) = 19^53 (mod 77). Using modular exponentiation, we find that S = 62.\n\nSo, the corresponding digital signature for the document with a hash value of 19 is 62."
