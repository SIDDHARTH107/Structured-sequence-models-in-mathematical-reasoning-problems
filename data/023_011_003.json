    "message_2": "The given signal is already in the sum of sinusoids form, which is the time-domain representation of the Fourier series. Each term in the sum represents a component of the signal with a specific amplitude and frequency. \n\nThe general form of a sinusoid is $A\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$ or $A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase shift.\n\nFor the given signal $f(t) = 2\\sin(5t) + 3\\cos(7t) + 5\\sin(10t)$, we can identify the amplitude and frequency of each component directly:\n\n1. First component: $2\\sin(5t)$\n   - Amplitude: $A_1 = 2$\n   - Angular frequency: $\\omega_1 = 5$ (rad/s)\n   - Frequency: $f_1 = \\frac{\\omega_1}{2\\pi} = \\frac{5}{2\\pi}$ (Hz)\n\n2. Second component: $3\\cos(7t)$\n   - Amplitude: $A_2 = 3$\n   - Angular frequency: $\\omega_2 = 7$ (rad/s)\n   - Frequency: $f_2 = \\frac{\\omega_2}{2\\pi} = \\frac{7}{2\\pi}$ (Hz)\n\n3. Third component: $5\\sin(10t)$\n   - Amplitude: $A_3 = 5$\n   - Angular frequency: $\\omega_3 = 10$ (rad/s)\n   - Frequency: $f_3 = \\frac{\\omega_3}{2\\pi} = \\frac{10}{2\\pi}$ (Hz)\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of the components are:\n\n1. First component: Amplitude $A_1 = 2$, Frequency $f_1 = \\frac{5}{2\\pi}$ Hz\n2. Second component: Amplitude $A_2 = 3$, Frequency $f_2 = \\frac{7}{2\\pi}$ Hz\n3. Third component: Amplitude $A_3 = 5$, Frequency $f_3 = \\frac{10}{2\\pi}$ Hz"
