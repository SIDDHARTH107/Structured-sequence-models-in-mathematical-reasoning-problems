    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, we have the following truth values for the logical connectives:\n\n1. A ∧ B is true if and only if both A and B are true.\n2. ¬A is true if and only if A is false.\n3. A → B is true if and only if either A is false or B is true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given formula A ∧ ¬B → ¬C with A=1, B=0, and C=1:\n\n1. A = 1 (true)\n2. ¬B = ¬0 = 1 (true)\n3. C = 1 (true)\n4. ¬C = ¬1 = 0 (false)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the formula:\n\n(A ∧ ¬B) → ¬C = (1 ∧ 1) → 0 = 1 → 0\n\nAccording to the definition of the implication (→) in intuitionistic logic, A → B is true if and only if either A is false or B is true. In this case, A ∧ ¬B is true, and ¬C is false. Therefore, the formula is false.\n\nSo, the truth value of the formula A ∧ ¬B → ¬C with A=1, B=0, and C=1 is 0 (false)."
