    "message_2": "To find the second derivative, we first need to find the first derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 11x^3 + 8x - 4.\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), is found by taking the derivative of each term with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = (4 * 3)x^(4-1) - (3 * 11)x^(3-1) + 8 - 0\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 33x^2 + 8\n\nNow, we find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = (3 * 12)x^(3-1) - (2 * 33)x^(2-1)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 66x\n\nNow, we find the value of the second derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 66(2)\nf''(2) = 36(4) - 132\nf''(2) = 144 - 132\nf''(2) = 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 11x^3 + 8x - 4 at the point (x=2) is 12."
