    "message_2": "To find the residue of the given function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^3 - 8) at the singular point z = 2i, we first need to find the order of the pole at z = 2i.\n\nThe denominator of the function is z^3 - 8. We can factor this using the difference of cubes formula:\n\nz^3 - 8 = (z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4)\n\nNow, we can see that z = 2i is a simple pole (order 1) of the function, since the factor (z - 2i) does not appear in the denominator.\n\nNext, we need to find the residue of the function at z = 2i. Since it's a simple pole, we can use the following formula:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> 2i) [(z - 2i) * f(z)]\n\nNow, let's substitute f(z) into the formula:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> 2i) [(z - 2i) * (z^2 - 1) / ((z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4))]\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out the (z - 2i) term in the numerator and denominator:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> 2i) [(z^2 - 1) / (z^2 + 2z + 4)]\n\nNow, we can substitute z = 2i into the expression:\n\nResidue = ((2i)^2 - 1) / ((2i)^2 + 2(2i) + 4)\n\nResidue = (4i^2 - 1) / (4i^2 + 4i + 4)\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can simplify the expression:\n\nResidue = (4(-1) - 1) / (4(-1) + 4i + 4)\n\nResidue = (-4 - 1) / (-4 + 4i + 4)\n\nResidue = -5 / (4i)\n\nFinally, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to get the residue in standard form:\n\nResidue = -5 / (4i) * (-4i) / (-4i)\n\nResidue = (20i) / 16\n\nResidue = 5i/4\n\nSo, the residue of the complex function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^3 - 8) at the singular point z = 2i is 5i/4."
