    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 6, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 6 must have a prime factorization of 2 * 3.\n2. There are two possibilities for the group: either it is cyclic or it is not.\n\nCase 1: Cyclic group\nIf the group is cyclic, it is isomorphic to the group Z_6 (the integers modulo 6 under addition). There is only one isomorphism class in this case.\n\nCase 2: Non-cyclic group\nIf the group is not cyclic, it must have elements of order 2 and 3. Let's denote the element of order 2 as a and the element of order 3 as b. Then, the group can be represented as {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2}, where e is the identity element.\n\nSince a has order 2, we have a^2 = e. And since b has order 3, we have b^3 = e. Now, we need to find the product of a and b. Since the group is non-cyclic, the product ab cannot be equal to e, a, b, or b^2. Therefore, ab must be equal to either ab^2 or b^2.\n\nIf ab = ab^2, then multiplying both sides by b^(-1) (the inverse of b) gives b = a, which is a contradiction since a and b have different orders. So, ab = b^2.\n\nNow, we can compute (ab)^2 = abab = a(b^2)a = a(ab)a = aa = e. This shows that the group is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3, which is the group of all permutations of 3 elements.\n\nIn this case, there is also only one isomorphism class.\n\nConclusion:\nThere are 2 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 6: one isomorphic to Z_6 (cyclic) and one isomorphic to S_3 (non-cyclic)."
