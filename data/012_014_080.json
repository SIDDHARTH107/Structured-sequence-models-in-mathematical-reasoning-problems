    "message_2": "Without the specific details of the vertices and edges in Graph A and Graph B, it is impossible to determine if they are isomorphic. However, I can provide you with a general approach to determine if two graphs are isomorphic.\n\nTo check if Graph A and Graph B are isomorphic, follow these steps:\n\n1. Verify that both graphs have the same number of vertices and edges. In this case, both Graph A and Graph B have 5 vertices and 7 edges, so they meet this condition.\n\n2. Check the degree sequence of both graphs. The degree sequence is a list of the degrees of all vertices in a graph, sorted in non-increasing order. If the degree sequences of both graphs are the same, then there is a possibility that the graphs are isomorphic.\n\n3. Try to find a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the vertices of Graph A and Graph B such that the adjacency between vertices is preserved. In other words, if two vertices are connected by an edge in Graph A, their corresponding vertices in Graph B should also be connected by an edge.\n\nIf you can find such a correspondence, then Graph A and Graph B are isomorphic. If not, they are not isomorphic.\n\nTo provide a more specific answer, please provide the details of the vertices and edges in Graph A and Graph B."
