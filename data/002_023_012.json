    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius of the sphere is 6 cm, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (6 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 36 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 144 * π cm^2\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 144 * 3.14159 cm^2\n\nSurface Area ≈ 452.389342 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 6 cm is approximately 452.39 cm^2."
