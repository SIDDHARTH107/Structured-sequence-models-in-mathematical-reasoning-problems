    "message_1": "A market research report shows that the probability of a customer purchasing a product is 0.25. If a company distributes 100 brochures, what is the probability that at least 30 customers will purchase the product?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 30 customers will purchase the product, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (customers purchasing the product) out of n trials (brochures distributed)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (0.25 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (100 brochures distributed)\n- k is the number of successes (at least 30 customers purchasing the product)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 30 customers purchasing the product, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 30, 31, ..., 100.\n\nP(X >= 30) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 30 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be quite tedious. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the probability of at least 30 customers purchasing the product is equal to 1 minus the probability of fewer than 30 customers purchasing the product.\n\nP(X >= 30) = 1 - P(X < 30) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 29\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 29 and subtract it from 1 to find the probability of at least 30 customers purchasing the product.\n\nP(X >= 30) = 1 - Σ [C(100, k) * (0.25)^k * (0.75)^(100-k)] for k = 0 to 29\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 30) ≈ 1 - 0.067 = 0.933\n\nSo, the probability that at least 30 customers will purchase the product after distributing 100 brochures is approximately 0.933 or 93.3%."
