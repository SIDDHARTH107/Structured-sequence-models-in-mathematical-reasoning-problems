    "message_2": "To find the current in the wire 10 milliseconds after the switch is closed, we need to consider the transient behavior of the RLC circuit. The circuit consists of a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected in series to a voltage source (V). \n\nGiven:\nR = 20 ohms\nV = 120 volts\nL = 5 H\nC = 10 μF = 10 * 10^(-6) F\nt = 10 ms = 10 * 10^(-3) s\n\nFirst, we need to find the time constant for the circuit. The time constant for an RLC circuit is given by:\n\nτ = 2 * L / R\n\nτ = 2 * 5 H / 20 ohms\nτ = 0.5 s\n\nNext, we need to find the damped angular frequency (ω_d) and the natural angular frequency (ω_0). The damped angular frequency is given by:\n\nω_d = sqrt(1 / (L * C) - (R / (2 * L))^2)\n\nω_d = sqrt(1 / (5 H * 10 * 10^(-6) F) - (20 ohms / (2 * 5 H))^2)\nω_d = sqrt(1 / 50 * 10^(-6) - (2)^2)\nω_d = sqrt(20000 - 4)\nω_d = sqrt(19996)\nω_d ≈ 141.4 rad/s\n\nThe natural angular frequency is given by:\n\nω_0 = 1 / sqrt(L * C)\n\nω_0 = 1 / sqrt(5 H * 10 * 10^(-6) F)\nω_0 = 1 / sqrt(50 * 10^(-6))\nω_0 = 1 / (sqrt(50) * 10^(-3))\nω_0 ≈ 141.4 rad/s\n\nSince ω_d ≈ ω_0, the circuit is underdamped.\n\nNow, we need to find the transient current (i(t)) in the circuit. The transient current for an underdamped RLC circuit is given by:\n\ni(t) = V / R * (1 - e^(-R * t / (2 * L)) * cos(ω_d * t))\n\ni(10 ms) = 120 V / 20 ohms * (1 - e^(-20 ohms * 10 * 10^(-3) s / (2 * 5 H)) * cos(141.4 rad/s * 10 * 10^(-3) s))\ni(10 ms) = 6 A * (1 - e^(-0.01) * cos(1.414))\ni(10 ms) ≈ 6 A * (1 - 0.99005 * 0.1553)\ni(10 ms) ≈ 6 A * 0.0153\ni(10 ms) ≈ 0.0918 A\n\nTherefore, the current in the wire 10 milliseconds after the switch is closed is approximately 0.0918 A."
