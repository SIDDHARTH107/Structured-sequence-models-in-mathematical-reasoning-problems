    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, and then solve for dy/dx.\n\nGiven equation: x^3 + y^3 = 10\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\nd(x^3)/dx + d(y^3)/dx = d(10)/dx\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n3x^2 + 3y^2(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n3y^2(dy/dx) = -3x^2\n\n(dy/dx) = -3x^2 / 3y^2\n\n(dy/dx) = -x^2 / y^2\n\nWe are given that x = 2. To find the corresponding value of y, we can plug this value back into the original equation:\n\n(2)^3 + y^3 = 10\n\n8 + y^3 = 10\n\ny^3 = 2\n\ny = 2^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative dy/dx at x = 2:\n\n(dy/dx) = -(2^2) / (2^(1/3))^2\n\n(dy/dx) = -4 / (2^(2/3))\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 2 is:\n\ndy/dx = -4 / (2^(2/3))"
