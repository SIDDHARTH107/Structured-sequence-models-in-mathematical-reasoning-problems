    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 10, which is the product of two distinct prime numbers, 2 and 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there must exist a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nSince the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup is 2, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, Q must be a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, since the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup is 5, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, P must also be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, since P and Q are both normal subgroups of G, their intersection, P ∩ Q, is also a normal subgroup of G. However, since P has order 2 and Q has order 5, their intersection must be trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal subgroups of G with trivial intersection, we can form the internal direct product of P and Q, denoted as PQ. The order of PQ is given by |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 2 * 5 / 1 = 10. Thus, PQ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, which implies that PQ = G.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIf G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10. This is because the order of G is 10, which is a product of two distinct prime numbers, and by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, i.e., G ≅ C2 × C5 ≅ C10.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIf G is non-abelian, then it must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D5. This is because the only non-abelian group of order 10 is the dihedral group D5. To see this, note that G is generated by the elements of P and Q, and since P and Q are both normal subgroups of G, we can write any element g ∈ G as g = pq, where p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. The dihedral group D5 has a presentation given by D5 = ⟨r, s | r^5 = s^2 = e, sr = r^4s⟩, where r and s are the rotation and reflection elements, respectively. We can identify the elements of P with the reflections in D5 and the elements of Q with the rotations in D5. Since the relations in D5 are consistent with the group structure of G, we conclude that G is isomorphic to D5.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be either isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. If G is abelian, then it is isomorphic to C10, and if G is non-abelian, then it is isomorphic to D5."
