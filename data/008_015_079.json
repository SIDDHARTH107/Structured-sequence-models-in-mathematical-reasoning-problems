    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to check if the given matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The matrix A is:\n\nA = | 3  6  9 |\n    | 6 13 20 |\n    | 9 20 37 |\n\nThe matrix A is symmetric, so we can proceed with the Cholesky decomposition. Now, we need to find the lower triangular matrix L such that A = L * L^T.\n\nWe can find L using the following formulas:\n\nL[1,1] = sqrt(A[1,1]) = sqrt(3) = 1.73\nL[2,1] = A[2,1] / L[1,1] = 6 / 1.73 = 3.46\nL[3,1] = A[3,1] / L[1,1] = 9 / 1.73 = 5.19\n\nL[2,2] = sqrt(A[2,2] - L[2,1]^2) = sqrt(13 - 3.46^2) = 1.24\nL[3,2] = (A[3,2] - L[3,1] * L[2,1]) / L[2,2] = (20 - 5.19 * 3.46) / 1.24 = 1.86\n\nL[3,3] = sqrt(A[3,3] - L[3,1]^2 - L[3,2]^2) = sqrt(37 - 5.19^2 - 1.86^2) = 1.67\n\nSo, the lower triangular matrix L is:\n\nL = | 1.73  0.00  0.00 |\n    | 3.46  1.24  0.00 |\n    | 5.19  1.86  1.67 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system L * L^T * X = B, where B is the right-hand side vector:\n\nB = | 21 |\n    | 52 |\n    | 93 |\n\nFirst, we solve the system L * Y = B for Y:\n\n1.73y1 = 21 => y1 = 21 / 1.73 = 12.14\n3.46y1 + 1.24y2 = 52 => y2 = (52 - 3.46 * 12.14) / 1.24 = -2.00\n5.19y1 + 1.86y2 + 1.67y3 = 93 => y3 = (93 - 5.19 * 12.14 - 1.86 * (-2.00)) / 1.67 = 1.00\n\nSo, Y = | 12.14 |\n        | -2.00 |\n        |  1.00 |\n\nNext, we solve the system L^T * X = Y for X:\n\n1.73x1 + 3.46x2 + 5.19x3 = 12.14 => x1 = (12.14 - 3.46 * (-2.00) - 5.19 * 1.00) / 1.73 = 1.00\n1.24x2 + 1.86x3 = -2.00 => x2 = (-2.00 - 1.86 * 1.00) / 1.24 = -2.00\n1.67x3 = 1.00 => x3 = 1.00 / 1.67 = 0.60\n\nSo, X = |  1.00 |\n        | -2.00 |\n        |  0.60 |\n\nTherefore, the solution of the system of linear equations is x = 1.00, y = -2.00, and z = 0.60 (rounded to two decimal places)."
