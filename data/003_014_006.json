    "message_1": "A student needs to graph y = 2sin(3x + pi) from 0 to 2π on a coordinate plane. What are the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function, and what are the x and y-intercepts of the graph?",
    "message_2": "To analyze the given function y = 2sin(3x + pi), we can compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A sin(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C determines the phase shift.\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 2. So, the amplitude is 2.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sinusoidal function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In this case, B = 3. So, the period is (2π)/3.\n\n3. Phase Shift: The phase shift is given by the formula -C/B. In this case, C = pi and B = 3. So, the phase shift is -pi/3.\n\nNow, let's find the x and y-intercepts of the graph:\n\n4. x-intercepts: To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = 2sin(3x + pi)\n\nsin(3x + pi) = 0\n\n3x + pi = nπ, where n is an integer\n\n3x = nπ - pi\n\nx = (nπ - pi)/3\n\nSince we are looking for x-intercepts in the interval [0, 2π], we can find the values of n that satisfy this condition:\n\nFor n = 0, x = -pi/3 (not in the interval [0, 2π])\n\nFor n = 1, x = 2π/3 (in the interval [0, 2π])\n\nFor n = 2, x = 5π/3 (in the interval [0, 2π])\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 2π/3 and x = 5π/3.\n\n5. y-intercept: To find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y. So, we have:\n\ny = 2sin(3(0) + pi)\n\ny = 2sin(pi)\n\nSince sin(pi) = 0, the y-intercept is y = 0.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π)/3, the phase shift is -pi/3, the x-intercepts are x = 2π/3 and x = 5π/3, and the y-intercept is y = 0."
