    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap greater than 100, we need to find two consecutive prime numbers whose difference is greater than 100.\n\nUsing a prime number list or a prime number calculator, we can find that the two consecutive prime numbers with the smallest gap greater than 100 are:\n\n2081 (prime) and 2113 (prime)\n\nThe prime gap between these two numbers is:\n\n2113 - 2081 = 32\n\nSo, the smallest prime gap greater than 100 is 32."
