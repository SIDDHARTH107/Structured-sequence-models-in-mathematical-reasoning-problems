    "message_2": "To show that G must have at least one element of order 2, 3, and 5, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet the order of G be 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups of G with orders 2, 3, and 5, respectively.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n2. n_3 divides 10 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. n_5 divides 6 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C30, then G is a cyclic group of order 30. In this case, there is one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, which implies n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1. This satisfies the conditions, so G could be isomorphic to C30.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to D15, then G is a dihedral group of order 30. In this case, there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, which implies n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1. This also satisfies the conditions, so G could be isomorphic to D15.\n\n3. If G is a non-abelian group of order 30, then it cannot be isomorphic to C30 or D15. In this case, we can show that there must be at least one element of order 2, 3, and 5 as follows:\n\n- Since n_2 > 1, there must be at least one non-identity element of order 2.\n- Since n_3 > 1, there must be at least one non-identity element of order 3.\n- Since n_5 > 1, there must be at least one non-identity element of order 5.\n\nThus, G must have at least one element of order 2, 3, and 5.\n\nHowever, we cannot determine which of the three possible isomorphism types G must be isomorphic to based solely on this information. Additional information about the group structure or properties would be needed to make that determination."
