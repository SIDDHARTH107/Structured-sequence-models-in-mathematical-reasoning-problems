    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this case, we will use the HS algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 7 in the interval [0, 2]. Here's a simplified version of the HS algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the problem parameters: \n   - Harmony Memory Size (HMS): the number of candidate solutions (e.g., 10)\n   - Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): probability of choosing a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.8)\n   - Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): probability of adjusting a value after selecting it from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.3)\n   - Number of iterations (NI): the number of times the algorithm will be repeated (e.g., 1000)\n\n2. Generate an initial harmony memory (HM) by randomly creating HMS candidate solutions within the given interval [0, 2].\n\n3. For each iteration, create a new harmony vector (solution) as follows:\n   - For each decision variable (in this case, x), generate a random number between 0 and 1.\n   - If the random number is less than HMCR, select a value from the HM for that variable.\n   - If the random number is also less than PAR, adjust the selected value by adding or subtracting a small random amount.\n   - If the random number is greater than HMCR, generate a new random value for that variable within the given interval.\n\n4. Evaluate the new harmony vector using the objective function f(x).\n\n5. If the new harmony vector is better than the worst harmony in the HM, replace the worst harmony with the new one.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the specified number of iterations (NI).\n\n7. The best harmony vector in the HM represents the approximate minimum value of the function f(x).\n\nPlease note that the HS algorithm is a heuristic method, and the results may vary depending on the parameter settings and random factors. To obtain a more accurate result, you can increase the number of iterations or use other optimization algorithms."
