    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will apply the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1).\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(5x)/dx + d(2)/dx\n\nApplying the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = (6x) - (5) + (0)\nf'(x) = 6x - 5\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 6(4) - 5\nf'(4) = 24 - 5\nf'(4) = 19\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 at x = 4 is 19."
