    "message_2": "To find the Poincaré dual homology class $[\\gamma]$ of $\\gamma$ in $H_1(S;\\mathbb{Z})$, we first need to understand the homology groups of the surface $S$ of genus $2$. Recall that the homology groups of a compact orientable surface of genus $g$ are given by:\n\n$H_0(S;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$,\n$H_1(S;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$,\n$H_2(S;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIn our case, $g=2$, so $H_1(S;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^4$. A basis for $H_1(S;\\mathbb{Z})$ can be given by four closed curves, say $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the standard generators of the $i$-th handle of the surface. These generators satisfy the following intersection properties:\n\n- $a_i \\cdot a_j = 0$ for all $i, j$,\n- $b_i \\cdot b_j = 0$ for all $i, j$,\n- $a_i \\cdot b_j = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nNow, let's consider the closed curve $\\gamma$ on $S$ that intersects itself twice transversely. We can homotope $\\gamma$ to a curve that intersects the standard generators in a minimal way. Let $n_{a_1}, n_{b_1}, n_{a_2}, n_{b_2}$ be the number of times $\\gamma$ intersects $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2$, respectively, with appropriate signs according to the orientation.\n\nSince $\\gamma$ intersects itself twice transversely, we have the self-intersection number $\\gamma \\cdot \\gamma = 2$. The self-intersection number can be computed using the intersection properties of the standard generators:\n\n$\\gamma \\cdot \\gamma = (n_{a_1}a_1 + n_{b_1}b_1 + n_{a_2}a_2 + n_{b_2}b_2) \\cdot (n_{a_1}a_1 + n_{b_1}b_1 + n_{a_2}a_2 + n_{b_2}b_2) = 2$.\n\nExpanding this expression and using the intersection properties of the standard generators, we get:\n\n$2 = n_{a_1}^2(a_1 \\cdot a_1) + 2n_{a_1}n_{b_1}(a_1 \\cdot b_1) + n_{b_1}^2(b_1 \\cdot b_1) + n_{a_2}^2(a_2 \\cdot a_2) + 2n_{a_2}n_{b_2}(a_2 \\cdot b_2) + n_{b_2}^2(b_2 \\cdot b_2)$.\n\nSince $a_i \\cdot a_j = 0$ and $b_i \\cdot b_j = 0$ for all $i, j$, this simplifies to:\n\n$2 = 2n_{a_1}n_{b_1} + 2n_{a_2}n_{b_2}$.\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\n$1 = n_{a_1}n_{b_1} + n_{a_2}n_{b_2}$.\n\nNow, we can express the homology class $[\\gamma]$ of $\\gamma$ in terms of the standard generators:\n\n$[\\gamma] = n_{a_1}[a_1] + n_{b_1}[b_1] + n_{a_2}[a_2] + n_{b_2}[b_2]$.\n\nSince the self-intersection number $\\gamma \\cdot \\gamma = 2$, we know that $\\gamma$ is not homologous to zero. Therefore, $[\\gamma]$ is a non-trivial element in $H_1(S;\\mathbb{Z})$. However, without more information about the specific curve $\\gamma$, we cannot determine the exact values of $n_{a_1}, n_{b_1}, n_{a_2}, n_{b_2}$, and thus cannot find the precise homology class $[\\gamma]$ in $H_1(S;\\mathbb{Z})$."
