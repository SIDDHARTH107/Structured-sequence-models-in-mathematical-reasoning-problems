    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, divides 18/3 = 6 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 6. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, divides 18/2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be either 1, 3, or 9.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it is normal in G. Let P be this normal 3-Sylow subgroup, so |P| = 3. Since G has order 18, there must be a 2-Sylow subgroup Q with |Q| = 6. Now, since P is normal in G, we can form the product set PQ = {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. We claim that G = PQ.\n\nTo prove this, we first show that |PQ| = |G|. Since |P| = 3 and |Q| = 6, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q are Sylow subgroups, their intersection can only have order 1 (the trivial subgroup) or order gcd(3, 6) = 3. However, if |P ∩ Q| = 3, then P ⊆ Q, which contradicts the fact that Q is a 2-Sylow subgroup. Thus, |P ∩ Q| = 1, and |PQ| = |P||Q| = 18 = |G|.\n\nNow, we know that G = PQ and P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, which is a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6. The group of order 6 can be either cyclic (C6) or the symmetric group on 3 elements (S3). Thus, in this case, G is isomorphic to either C3 × C6 (which is C18) or C3 × S3 (which is the non-abelian group of order 18).\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 6\nIf there are six 3-Sylow subgroups, then there must be a 2-Sylow subgroup Q with |Q| = 6. Since there are multiple 3-Sylow subgroups, none of them are normal in G. However, the product of two 3-Sylow subgroups must be another 3-Sylow subgroup, so the normalizer of any 3-Sylow subgroup must contain Q. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 6, which is either C6 or S3.\n\nIf the normal subgroup is C6, then G is a semidirect product of C3 and C6, which is isomorphic to C18. If the normal subgroup is S3, then G is a semidirect product of C3 and S3, which is the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6. To find the isomorphism type of G, one would need more information about the specific group G. However, the proof above shows that the isomorphism is valid for each case."
