    "message_1": "Consider a Koch island, whose initial side length is 1. Suppose we remove the middle third of each line segment, and replace it with two line segments of equal length, forming a new shape. If we repeat this process for each line segment of the new shape, how many line segments will there be after the fourth iteration?",
    "message_2": "A Koch island starts with an initial side length of 1, and after each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 4 new line segments. Therefore, after each iteration, the number of line segments is multiplied by 4.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 4 line segments.\nAfter the second iteration, there are 4 * 4 = 16 line segments.\nAfter the third iteration, there are 16 * 4 = 64 line segments.\nAfter the fourth iteration, there are 64 * 4 = 256 line segments.\n\nSo, after the fourth iteration, there will be 256 line segments."
