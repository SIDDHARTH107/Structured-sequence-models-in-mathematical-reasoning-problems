    "message_2": "To find the smallest number of people you need to invite to a party to guarantee that there are either three strangers who do not know each other or three people who are all friends with each other, we need to find the Ramsey number R(3,3).\n\nRamsey numbers are a part of graph theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs (networks of nodes connected by edges). In this context, the Ramsey number R(m,n) represents the smallest number of vertices in a graph such that, no matter how the edges are colored with two colors (usually red and blue), there will always be either a red clique of size m or a blue clique of size n.\n\nTo find R(3,3), we can use the following recursive formula for Ramsey numbers:\n\nR(m,n) = R(m-1,n) + R(m,n-1) - 1\n\nwith the base cases:\n\nR(2,n) = n\nR(m,2) = m\n\nUsing the base cases, we can find R(3,2) and R(2,3):\n\nR(3,2) = R(2,2) + R(3,1) - 1 = 2 + 3 - 1 = 4\nR(2,3) = R(1,3) + R(2,2) - 1 = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4\n\nNow, we can find R(3,3):\n\nR(3,3) = R(3,2) + R(2,3) - 1 = 4 + 4 - 1 = 7\n\nSo, the smallest number of people you need to invite to a party to guarantee that there are either three strangers who do not know each other or three people who are all friends with each other is 7."
