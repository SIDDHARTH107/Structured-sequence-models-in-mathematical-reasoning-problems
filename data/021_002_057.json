    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial guess for the eigenvector, which is given as [1; 1].\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current eigenvector.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method:\n\nInitial guess: x0 = [1; 1]\n\nStep 1:\nA * x0 = [3 1; 1 3] * [1; 1] = [4; 4]\nNormalize: x1 = [1; 1] (since it's already normalized)\n\nStep 2:\nA * x1 = [3 1; 1 3] * [1; 1] = [4; 4]\nNormalize: x2 = [1; 1] (no change)\n\nSince there is no change in the eigenvector, we have reached convergence.\n\nNow, to find the dominant eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\n位 = (x2^T * A * x2) / (x2^T * x2)\n\n位 = ([1 1] * [3 1; 1 3] * [1; 1]) / ([1 1] * [1; 1])\n\n位 = ([4 4] * [1; 1]) / (2) = (8) / (2) = 4\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is 位 = 4, and its corresponding eigenvector is [1; 1]."
