    "message_1": "What is the probability of an earthquake magnitude of 8.0 or higher occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area within the next 10 years based on the historical data, where the probability of this happening in any given year is 0.01%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the complement probability. The complement of the event \"an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher occurs within the next 10 years\" is the event \"no earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher occurs within the next 10 years.\"\n\nThe probability of no earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher occurring in any given year is 1 - 0.01% = 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of no earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher occurring in the next 10 years. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities:\n\nP(no earthquake in 10 years) = 0.9999^10 ≈ 0.9990005\n\nNow, we can find the complement of this probability, which is the probability of an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher occurring within the next 10 years:\n\nP(earthquake in 10 years) = 1 - P(no earthquake in 10 years) = 1 - 0.9990005 ≈ 0.0009995\n\nSo, the probability of an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area within the next 10 years is approximately 0.0009995, or 0.09995%."
