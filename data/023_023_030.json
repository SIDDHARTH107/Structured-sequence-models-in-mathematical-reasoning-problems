    "message_2": "The given voltage waveform is already in the form of a Fourier series, which is a sum of sinusoidal functions with different amplitudes and frequencies. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nv(t) = A0 + ∑[An * sin(nωt) + Bn * cos(nωt)]\n\nwhere A0 is the DC component, An and Bn are the amplitudes of the sine and cosine terms, n is the harmonic number, and ω is the fundamental angular frequency.\n\nIn this case, the waveform is given by:\n\nv(t) = 5 + 10sin(100πt) + 8sin(200πt) + 6sin(500πt)\n\nComparing this to the general form of a Fourier series, we can identify the amplitudes and frequencies of each harmonic component:\n\n1. DC component (A0): 5 V\n2. First harmonic (n=1):\n   Amplitude (A1): 10 V\n   Frequency (f1): 100πt => f1 = (100π) / (2π) = 50 Hz\n3. Second harmonic (n=2):\n   Amplitude (A2): 8 V\n   Frequency (f2): 200πt => f2 = (200π) / (2π) = 100 Hz\n4. Third harmonic (n=3):\n   Amplitude (A3): 6 V\n   Frequency (f3): 500πt => f3 = (500π) / (2π) = 250 Hz\n\nSo, the harmonic components of the waveform are:\n\n1. DC component: 5 V\n2. First harmonic: Amplitude = 10 V, Frequency = 50 Hz\n3. Second harmonic: Amplitude = 8 V, Frequency = 100 Hz\n4. Third harmonic: Amplitude = 6 V, Frequency = 250 Hz"
