    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by -1. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent, and the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate x by adding the first and third equations:\n\n$(x + 2y - 3z) + (-x - 2y + 3z) = 7 + (-7)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$0 = 0$\n\nNow, let's express y in terms of z using the first equation:\n\n$x + 2y - 3z = 7$\n\n$2y = 3z - x + 7$\n\n$y = \\frac{3z - x + 7}{2}$\n\nSince there are infinitely many solutions, we can express the general solution in terms of z:\n\n$x = x$\n\n$y = \\frac{3z - x + 7}{2}$\n\n$z = z$\n\nThis is the general solution for the given system of linear equations with singular matrices."
