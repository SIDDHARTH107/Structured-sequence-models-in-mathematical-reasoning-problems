    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (D) can be found using the formula:\n\nD = √(L^2 + W^2 + H^2)\n\nwhere L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nL = 8 cm\nW = 6 cm\nH = 4 cm\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = √(8^2 + 6^2 + 4^2)\nD = √(64 + 36 + 16)\nD = √116\nD ≈ 10.77 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 10.77 cm."
