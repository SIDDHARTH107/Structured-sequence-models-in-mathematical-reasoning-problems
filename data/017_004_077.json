    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2), we can apply the Sylow theorems. Let n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we have that n_5 divides the order of G and n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, say H.\n\nSince H is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal in G. The order of H is 5, which is prime, so H is a cyclic group generated by some element of order 5, say h (i.e., H = ⟨h⟩).\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of H is 5, the order of G/H is 25/5 = 5, which is prime. Therefore, G/H is a cyclic group, generated by some coset gH, where g is an element of G.\n\nNow, we claim that G is generated by the elements h and g (i.e., G = ⟨h, g⟩). To see this, let x be an arbitrary element of G. Since G/H is generated by gH, we can write xH = (gH)^k for some integer k. This means that x is in the coset (g^k)H, so there exists an element y in H such that x = g^k * y. Since H is generated by h, we can write y = h^l for some integer l. Thus, x = g^k * h^l, which shows that x is in the group generated by h and g.\n\nSince G is generated by h and g, we have G = ⟨h, g⟩. Moreover, since H is normal in G, we can form the direct product of H and ⟨g⟩, which is a group of order 5 * 5 = 25. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are H and ⟨g⟩. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, as desired."
