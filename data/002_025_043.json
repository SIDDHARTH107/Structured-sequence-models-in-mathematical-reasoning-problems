    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has two equal sides measuring 6 centimeters each, and the angle between them is 110 degrees. Find the length of the third side of the triangle.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and the angle C between sides a and b, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, the two equal sides are a and b, both measuring 6 centimeters, and the angle between them is C = 110 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n110 degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 1.91986 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 6² + 6² - 2 * 6 * 6 * cos(1.91986)\nc² = 36 + 36 - 72 * cos(1.91986)\nc² ≈ 36 + 36 - 72 * (-0.34202)\nc² ≈ 36 + 36 + 24.62544\nc² ≈ 96.62544\n\nNow, we can find the length of the third side by taking the square root of c²:\n\nc ≈ √96.62544\nc ≈ 9.83 centimeters\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the triangle is approximately 9.83 centimeters."
