    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, for f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2, we will find the antiderivative for each term separately:\n\n1. For the term 3x^2, n = 2. Using the power rule, we get:\n   (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\n2. For the term -6x, n = 1. Using the power rule, we get:\n   (-6x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-6x^2)/2 = -3x^2\n\n3. For the constant term 2, we can treat it as 2x^0, with n = 0. Using the power rule, we get:\n   (2x^(0+1))/(0+1) = (2x^1)/1 = 2x\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + C"
