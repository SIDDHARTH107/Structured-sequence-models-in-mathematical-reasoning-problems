    "message_1": "Suppose the heights of a certain population follow a normal distribution with mean 170cm and standard deviation 8cm. If a sample of 25 people is taken, what is the probability that the sample mean height is between 168cm and 172cm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution with the same mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 170 cm, the population standard deviation (σ) is 8 cm, and the sample size (n) is 25. \n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean), which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nσ_sample_mean = 8 / √25\nσ_sample_mean = 8 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 1.6 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of sample mean heights (168 cm to 172 cm). The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor the lower bound (168 cm):\n\nz_lower = (168 - 170) / 1.6\nz_lower = -2 / 1.6\nz_lower ≈ -1.25\n\nFor the upper bound (172 cm):\n\nz_upper = (172 - 170) / 1.6\nz_upper = 2 / 1.6\nz_upper ≈ 1.25\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean height is between these z-scores. We can do this by looking up the z-scores in a standard normal distribution table or using a calculator or software that can compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the standard normal distribution.\n\nP(-1.25 < z < 1.25) = CDF(1.25) - CDF(-1.25)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that:\n\nCDF(1.25) ≈ 0.8944\nCDF(-1.25) ≈ 0.2119\n\nP(-1.25 < z < 1.25) = 0.8944 - 0.2119\nP(-1.25 < z < 1.25) ≈ 0.6825\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean height is between 168 cm and 172 cm is approximately 68.25%."
