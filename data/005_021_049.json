    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval of the mean height of the population using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the original dataset of 1000 heights. Let's call this dataset `heights`.\n\n2. Perform the bootstrapping process by resampling the original dataset with replacement 1000 times. For each bootstrap sample, calculate the mean height. Store these 1000 mean heights in a list called `bootstrap_means`.\n\n3. Sort the `bootstrap_means` list in ascending order.\n\n4. Calculate the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted `bootstrap_means` list. These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval, respectively.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming 'heights' is a NumPy array containing the original dataset of 1000 heights\nheights = np.random.normal(loc=170, scale=10, size=1000)\n\n# Perform bootstrapping\nbootstrap_means = []\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(heights, size=len(heights), replace=True)\n    bootstrap_means.append(np.mean(bootstrap_sample))\n\n# Sort the bootstrap_means list\nbootstrap_means.sort()\n\n# Calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles\nlower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)\nupper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)\n\n# Print the 95% confidence interval\nprint(f\"The 95% confidence interval for the mean height is ({lower_bound:.2f}, {upper_bound:.2f})\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the 95% confidence interval for the mean height of the population, taking into account the bootstrapping process and the assumption of a normal distribution for the heights."
