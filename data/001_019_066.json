    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x-3| = 9, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 3 = 9\nIn this case, we can solve for x as follows:\n2x = 9 + 3\n2x = 12\nx = 6\n\nCase 2: 2x - 3 = -9\nIn this case, we can solve for x as follows:\n2x = -9 + 3\n2x = -6\nx = -3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 6 and x = -3."
