    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions of the Diophantine equation 3x + 7y = 25, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 7, and then use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution. After that, we can find the general solution.\n\nStep 1: Find the GCD of 3 and 7\nSince 3 and 7 are both prime numbers, their GCD is 1. So, there exists a solution to the equation.\n\nStep 2: Find a particular solution using the extended Euclidean algorithm\nWe need to find integers x and y such that 3x + 7y = 1, and then multiply both sides by 25 to get the particular solution for the given equation.\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n7 = 3 * 2 + 1\n1 = 7 - 3 * 2\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 25:\n\n25 = 7 * 25 - 3 * 2 * 25\n\nSo, a particular solution is x = -50 and y = 25.\n\nStep 3: Find the general solution\nThe general solution of the Diophantine equation 3x + 7y = 25 can be written as:\n\nx = x0 + 7t\ny = y0 - 3t\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions we found, and t is an integer.\n\nx = -50 + 7t\ny = 25 - 3t\n\nNow, we have the general solution for all integer values of t."
