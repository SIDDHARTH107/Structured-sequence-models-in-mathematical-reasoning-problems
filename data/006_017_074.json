    "message_1": "Suppose that on a certain stretch of road, 20% of accidents are caused by drunk driving, 30% are caused by speeding, and 10% are caused by both drunk driving and speeding. What is the probability that an accident on this stretch of road is caused by either drunk driving or speeding?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of an accident being caused by either drunk driving or speeding, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A represents drunk driving, B represents speeding, and the intersection (A ∩ B) represents accidents caused by both drunk driving and speeding.\n\nIn this case, P(A) = 0.20 (20% of accidents caused by drunk driving), P(B) = 0.30 (30% of accidents caused by speeding), and P(A ∩ B) = 0.10 (10% of accidents caused by both drunk driving and speeding).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.20 + 0.30 - 0.10 = 0.40\n\nSo, the probability that an accident on this stretch of road is caused by either drunk driving or speeding is 40%."
