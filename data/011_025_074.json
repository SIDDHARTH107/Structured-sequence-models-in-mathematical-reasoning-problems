    "message_1": "How many different possible ways can a game of tic-tac-toe end if the game is allowed to continue until either player wins or the board is completely filled, assuming that both players play optimally?",
    "message_2": "In a game of tic-tac-toe, there are 9! (9 factorial) or 362,880 possible ways to fill the board. However, many of these possibilities are redundant or invalid (e.g., one player getting more than one turn in a row, or the game continuing after a win).\n\nWhen both players play optimally, the game will either end in a draw or one of the players will win. In an optimal game, the first player (X) has 3 unique opening moves due to the symmetry of the board: corner, edge, or center. We can analyze each of these cases separately.\n\n1. X plays in the corner:\nO has 5 unique responses: the opposite corner, an adjacent corner, the center, or an adjacent edge. However, playing in an adjacent corner or edge will lead to a forced win for X. So, O has 3 optimal responses: opposite corner or center. If O plays in the opposite corner, the game will end in a draw. If O plays in the center, X has 4 unique responses, and all of them lead to a draw.\n\n2. X plays on the edge:\nO has 4 unique responses: an adjacent corner, the center, or an opposite edge. However, playing in an opposite edge will lead to a forced win for X. So, O has 3 optimal responses: adjacent corner or center. If O plays in the center, X has 4 unique responses, and all of them lead to a draw. If O plays in an adjacent corner, X has 3 unique responses, and all of them lead to a draw.\n\n3. X plays in the center:\nO has 4 unique responses: a corner or an edge. If O plays in a corner, X has 4 unique responses, and all of them lead to a draw. If O plays on an edge, X has 4 unique responses, and all of them lead to a draw.\n\nIn summary, when both players play optimally, there are no winning positions for either player, and all games end in a draw. The total number of unique optimal games is:\n\n1 (X in corner) * 3 (O's optimal responses) * 4 (X's responses after O in center) + 1 (X on edge) * 3 (O's optimal responses) * 3 (X's responses after O in adjacent corner) + 1 (X in center) * 4 (O's responses) * 4 (X's responses) = 12 + 9 + 16 = 37 unique optimal games that end in a draw."
