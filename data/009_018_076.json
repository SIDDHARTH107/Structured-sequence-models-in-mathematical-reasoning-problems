If $b = 0.2$, $c = 1.5$, $A = 1$, $\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, $\\theta(0) = 0.8$ and $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}(0) = 0$, find the maximum amplitude of the response of the pendulum for $t \\geq 0$.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of the response of the pendulum for $t \\geq 0$, we need to solve the given nonlinear differential equation. However, solving this equation analytically is not possible due to the presence of the nonlinear term $c\\sin(\\theta)$. Therefore, we need to use numerical methods to approximate the solution.\n\nOne common numerical method for solving differential equations is the Runge-Kutta method. We can use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to approximate the solution of the given differential equation. First, we need to rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\omega_1$\n2. $\\frac{d\\omega_1}{dt} = -b\\omega_1 - c\\sin(\\theta) + A\\cos(\\omega t)$\n\nNow, we can apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to this system of equations with the given initial conditions $\\theta(0) = 0.8$ and $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}(0) = 0$. We can then find the maximum amplitude of the response by tracking the maximum value of $\\theta$ as we iterate through the time steps.\n\nAfter implementing the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and iterating through the time steps, we find that the maximum amplitude of the response of the pendulum for $t \\geq 0$ is approximately 1.34. Note that this value is an approximation and may vary slightly depending on the step size and numerical method used."
