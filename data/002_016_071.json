    "message_2": "An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the length of each side, we can simply divide the perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nPerimeter = 18 cm\nNumber of sides = 3\n\nLength of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides = 18 cm / 3 = 6 cm\n\nEach side of the equilateral triangle is 6 cm long."
