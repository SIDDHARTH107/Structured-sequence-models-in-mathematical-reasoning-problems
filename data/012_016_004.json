In our case, n = 6 and m = 9.\n\nNow, let's consider an edge e in G. We will find the Tutte polynomial of G^ and G^-.\n\n1. G^: By deleting an edge e, we get a graph G^ with n = 6 vertices and m = 8 edges. The Tutte polynomial of G^ is T_G^(x, y) = x^k(G^)(y-1)^(n-k(G^)), where k(G^) is the number of connected components in G^.\n\n2. G^-: By contracting an edge e, we get a graph G^- with n = 5 vertices and m = 8 edges. The Tutte polynomial of G^- is T_G^-(x, y) = x^k(G^-)(y-1)^(n-k(G^-)), where k(G^-) is the number of connected components in G^-.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of connected components in G^ and G^-.\n\nFor G^, since it has 8 edges and 6 vertices, it must be connected. Therefore, k(G^) = 1.\n\nFor G^-, since it has 8 edges and 5 vertices, it must also be connected. Therefore, k(G^-) = 1.\n\nNow, we can find the Tutte polynomials of G^ and G^-:\n\nT_G^(x, y) = x^1(y-1)^(6-1) = x(y-1)^5\nT_G^-(x, y) = x^1(y-1)^(5-1) = x(y-1)^4\n\nFinally, we can find the Tutte polynomial of G:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_G^(x, y) + T_G^-(x, y) = x(y-1)^5 + x(y-1)^4\n\nThus, the Tutte polynomial of G is T_G(x, y) = x(y-1)^5 + x(y-1)^4."
