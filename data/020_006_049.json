The company has 75 packages to transport. Each van costs $100/day and each truck costs $200/day. The company cannot rent a fraction of a van or a truck. \n\nWhat is the minimum cost for the company to transport all 75 packages?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of vans as V and the number of trucks as T. We need to find the optimal values of V and T that minimize the cost while satisfying the constraints.\n\nConstraint 1: Vans and trucks must carry all 75 packages.\n20V + 50T >= 75\n\nConstraint 2: The company cannot rent a fraction of a van or a truck.\nV and T must be integers.\n\nObjective: Minimize the cost.\nCost = 100V + 200T\n\nWe can start by testing different combinations of V and T that satisfy the constraints and find the one with the minimum cost.\n\n1. V = 1, T = 1\n20(1) + 50(1) = 70 (does not satisfy constraint 1)\n\n2. V = 2, T = 1\n20(2) + 50(1) = 90 (satisfies constraint 1)\nCost = 100(2) + 200(1) = $400\n\n3. V = 3, T = 1\n20(3) + 50(1) = 110 (satisfies constraint 1)\nCost = 100(3) + 200(1) = $500 (higher than previous cost)\n\n4. V = 4, T = 0\n20(4) + 50(0) = 80 (satisfies constraint 1)\nCost = 100(4) + 200(0) = $400 (same as previous minimum cost)\n\n5. V = 0, T = 2\n20(0) + 50(2) = 100 (satisfies constraint 1)\nCost = 100(0) + 200(2) = $400 (same as previous minimum cost)\n\nFrom the combinations tested, the minimum cost is $400, which can be achieved with either 2 vans and 1 truck, 4 vans and 0 trucks, or 0 vans and 2 trucks."
