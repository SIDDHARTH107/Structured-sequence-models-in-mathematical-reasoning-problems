    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5, we can use the method of completing the square or by finding the vertex of the parabola.\n\nCompleting the square:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5\n= (x^2 - 4x) + 5\n= (x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4 + 5\n= (x - 2)^2 + 1\n\nNow, the function is in the form f(x) = (x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. In this case, the vertex is (2, 1).\n\nSince the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive, the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum value. The minimum value of the function is the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is 1. There is no maximum value for this function since the parabola extends to infinity in the positive y-direction.\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 is 1, and there is no maximum value."
