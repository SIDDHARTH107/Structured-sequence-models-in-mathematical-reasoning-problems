    "message_2": "To determine if Graph 1 is isomorphic to Graph 2, we need to find a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the vertices of the two graphs such that the adjacency between vertices is preserved.\n\nLet's label the vertices of Graph 1 as A, B, and C, and the vertices of Graph 2 as D, E, and F.\n\nGraph 1:\n```\n  A B C\nA 0 1 1\nB 1 0 1\nC 1 1 0\n```\n\nGraph 2:\n```\n  D E F\nD 0 1 0\nE 1 0 1\nF 0 1 0\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.\n\nIn Graph 1:\n- Degree of A: 2 (connected to B and C)\n- Degree of B: 2 (connected to A and C)\n- Degree of C: 2 (connected to A and B)\n\nIn Graph 2:\n- Degree of D: 1 (connected to E)\n- Degree of E: 2 (connected to D and F)\n- Degree of F: 1 (connected to E)\n\nWe can see that the degree sequences of the two graphs are different. Graph 1 has a degree sequence of (2, 2, 2), while Graph 2 has a degree sequence of (1, 2, 1). Since the degree sequences are not the same, the two graphs cannot be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, Graph 1 is not isomorphic to Graph 2."
