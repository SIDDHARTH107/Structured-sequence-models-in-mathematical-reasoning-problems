    "message_1": "Suppose there is a used car market with two types of cars: high-quality cars worth $10,000 and low-quality cars worth $5,000. The percentage of high-quality cars in the market is 60%, while the percentage of low-quality cars is 40%. Before purchasing a car, buyers can run an inspection test that reveals the car's true quality, but the inspection costs the buyer $1,000. Assuming all buyers are rational and each buyer wants to maximize their expected payoff, what is the lowest possible price a seller can ask for a low-quality car to avoid adverse selection by the buyers?",
    "message_2": "To find the lowest possible price a seller can ask for a low-quality car to avoid adverse selection, we need to consider the expected payoff for a buyer who chooses to inspect the car and compare it to the expected payoff for a buyer who does not inspect the car.\n\nIf a buyer chooses to inspect the car, they will pay $1,000 for the inspection. If the car turns out to be high-quality, they will pay $10,000 for the car, and if it is low-quality, they will pay $5,000. The expected payoff for a buyer who inspects the car is:\n\nE_inspect = 0.6 * (10,000 - 1,000) + 0.4 * (5,000 - 1,000)\nE_inspect = 0.6 * 9,000 + 0.4 * 4,000\nE_inspect = 5,400 + 1,600\nE_inspect = 7,000\n\nNow, let's consider the expected payoff for a buyer who does not inspect the car. They will pay the price of the car, P, without knowing its true quality. The expected payoff for a buyer who does not inspect the car is:\n\nE_no_inspect = 0.6 * (10,000 - P) + 0.4 * (5,000 - P)\n\nTo avoid adverse selection, the expected payoff for a buyer who does not inspect the car should be equal to or greater than the expected payoff for a buyer who inspects the car:\n\nE_no_inspect >= E_inspect\n0.6 * (10,000 - P) + 0.4 * (5,000 - P) >= 7,000\n\nSolving for P:\n\n6,000 - 0.6P + 2,000 - 0.4P >= 7,000\n8,000 - P >= 7,000\nP <= 1,000\n\nTherefore, the lowest possible price a seller can ask for a low-quality car to avoid adverse selection by the buyers is $1,000."
