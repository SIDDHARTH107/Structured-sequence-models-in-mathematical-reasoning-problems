    "message_2": "A Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is generated by iteratively replacing each square with a cross shape made of five smaller squares. The perimeter of a Vicsek fractal increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of a Vicsek fractal at level n as P(n). The perimeter of the starting square (level 0) is P(0) = 4 * side length = 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nFor each iteration, the perimeter increases by a factor of 3. So, the perimeter of a Vicsek fractal at level n can be calculated as P(n) = P(0) * 3^n.\n\nFor a level 4 Vicsek fractal, the perimeter is P(4) = P(0) * 3^4 = 8 * 81 = 648.\n\nSo, the perimeter of a level 4 Vicsek fractal with a starting square side length of 2 is 648."
