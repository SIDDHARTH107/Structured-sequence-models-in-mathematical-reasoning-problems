The payoff matrix for this game is as follows:\n\n|    | X (A) | Y (A) |\n|----|-------|-------|\n| X (B) | 2,2   | 0,5   |\n| Y (B) | 5,0   | 1,1   |\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nFirst, let's look at Player A's strategies:\n\n1. If Player B chooses X, Player A should choose Y because 5 > 2.\n2. If Player B chooses Y, Player A should choose Y because 1 > 0.\n\nNow, let's look at Player B's strategies:\n\n1. If Player A chooses X, Player B should choose Y because 5 > 2.\n2. If Player A chooses Y, Player B should choose Y because 1 > 0.\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium of this game is when both players choose strategy Y, resulting in a payoff of (1,1)."
