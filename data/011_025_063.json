    "message_2": "Let's analyze the game using backward induction. We will start by considering the end of the game and work our way back to the beginning.\n\n1. If there is only 1, 2, or 3 stones left, the current player can take all of them and win the game.\n2. If there are 4 stones left, the current player will lose, because no matter how many stones they take (1, 2, or 3), the next player can take the remaining stones and win.\n3. If there are 5, 6, or 7 stones left, the current player can win by taking 1, 2, or 3 stones, respectively, leaving the next player with 4 stones (a losing position).\n4. If there are 8 stones left, the current player will lose, because no matter how many stones they take (1, 2, or 3), the next player will be left with a winning position (5, 6, or 7 stones).\n5. If there are 9, 10, or 11 stones left, the current player can win by taking 1, 2, or 3 stones, respectively, leaving the next player with 8 stones (a losing position).\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the starting position of 20 stones:\n\n1. If the current player takes 1 stone, there will be 19 stones left, which is a winning position for the next player (they can take 3 stones and leave the current player with 16, a multiple of 4).\n2. If the current player takes 2 stones, there will be 18 stones left, which is a winning position for the next player (they can take 2 stones and leave the current player with 16, a multiple of 4).\n3. If the current player takes 3 stones, there will be 17 stones left, which is a winning position for the next player (they can take 1 stone and leave the current player with 16, a multiple of 4).\n\nIn all cases, the next player can force the current player into a losing position. Therefore, if both players play optimally, the second player will win the game."
