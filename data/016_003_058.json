    "message_1": "Consider the quadratic polynomial $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$, where $c$ is a complex constant. Let $M$ be the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the sequence $f_c(0), f_c(f_c(0)), f_c(f_c(f_c(0))), \\dots$ remains bounded in absolute value. This set is called the Mandelbrot set. Find the area of the largest circular disk that lies entirely within the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.",
    "message_2": "The largest circular disk that lies entirely within the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is centered at the origin (0, 0) and has a radius of 1/4. This is because the Mandelbrot set is symmetric with respect to the real axis, and the largest disk is tangent to the real axis at the point c = -1/4.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider the following argument:\n\n1. For any c with |c| > 2, the sequence will not remain bounded, as |f_c(0)| = |c| > 2, and for any z with |z| > 2, |f_c(z)| > |z|^2 > 2|z|, so the sequence will grow without bound.\n\n2. For c = -1/4, the sequence remains bounded, as f_c(0) = -1/4, f_c(-1/4) = (-1/4)^2 - 1/4 = 1/16 - 1/4 = -3/16, and f_c(-3/16) = (-3/16)^2 - 1/4 = 9/256 - 1/4 = 1/256, and the sequence converges to 0.\n\n3. For any c with |c - (-1/4)| < 1/4, the sequence remains bounded, as the disk of radius 1/4 centered at -1/4 is contained within the Mandelbrot set.\n\nTherefore, the largest circular disk that lies entirely within the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has a radius of 1/4. The area of this disk is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius:\n\nA = π(1/4)^2 = π(1/16) = π/16.\n\nSo, the area of the largest circular disk that lies entirely within the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is π/16."
