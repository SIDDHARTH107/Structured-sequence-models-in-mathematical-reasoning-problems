    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation. The Fourier transform of y''(t) is given by:\n\nF{y''(t)} = (2πiω)^2 Y(ω)\n\nand the Fourier transform of y(t) is given by:\n\nF{y(t)} = Y(ω)\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t). Now, we can rewrite the given differential equation in the frequency domain:\n\n(2πiω)^2 Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) [(2πiω)^2 + 4] = 0\n\nSince Y(ω) ≠ 0, we have:\n\n(2πiω)^2 + 4 = 0\n\n(2πiω)^2 = -4\n\nω^2 = -1/(π^2)\n\nω = ±(1/π)i\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get the general solution y(t):\n\ny(t) = A * cos(t/π) + B * sin(t/π)\n\nNow, we can use the initial conditions to find the constants A and B:\n\ny(0) = 2 => A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) = 2\nA = 2\n\ny(π/2) = 0 => 2 * cos(π^2/2) + B * sin(π^2/2) = 0\nB = -2\n\nSo, the general solution to the given differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = 2 * cos(t/π) - 2 * sin(t/π)"
