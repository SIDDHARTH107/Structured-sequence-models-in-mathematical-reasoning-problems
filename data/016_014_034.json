    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-similar fractal, which means that its length scales with a power of its parameter. The length of the curve (L) can be expressed as:\n\nL = k * (parameter)^n\n\nwhere k is a constant and n is the scaling exponent.\n\nGiven that the length of the curve with a parameter of 0.5 is 40 units, we can find the constant k and the scaling exponent n:\n\n40 = k * (0.5)^n\n\nNow, we need to find the length of the curve with a parameter of 0.3:\n\nL = k * (0.3)^n\n\nTo find the length, we need to determine the values of k and n. Since we don't have enough information to find the exact values of k and n, we can't find the exact length of the curve with a parameter of 0.3. However, we can express the length as a function of k and n:\n\nL(0.3) = k * (0.3)^n"
