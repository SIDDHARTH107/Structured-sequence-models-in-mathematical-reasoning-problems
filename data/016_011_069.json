    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is generated by iteratively replacing each square with a cross of five smaller squares, where each smaller square has side length 1/3 of the previous square's side length. The perimeter of the fractal increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter after the 4th iteration, starting from an initial square of side length 1.\n\nIteration 1:\n- The initial square is replaced by a cross of 5 smaller squares, each with side length 1/3.\n- The perimeter of the cross is 8 * (1/3) = 8/3.\n\nIteration 2:\n- Each of the 8 smaller squares from the previous iteration is replaced by a cross of 5 even smaller squares, each with side length (1/3)^2.\n- The perimeter of the new fractal is 8 * (5 * (1/3)^2) = 40/9.\n\nIteration 3:\n- Each of the 40 smaller squares from the previous iteration is replaced by a cross of 5 even smaller squares, each with side length (1/3)^3.\n- The perimeter of the new fractal is 8 * (25 * (1/3)^3) = 200/27.\n\nIteration 4:\n- Each of the 200 smaller squares from the previous iteration is replaced by a cross of 5 even smaller squares, each with side length (1/3)^4.\n- The perimeter of the new fractal is 8 * (125 * (1/3)^4) = 1000/81.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Vicsek fractal after the 4th iteration, starting from an initial square of side length 1, is 1000/81."
