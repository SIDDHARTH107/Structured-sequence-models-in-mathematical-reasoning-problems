    "message_2": "To find an analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the entire complex plane, we need to find an equivalent expression for $f(z)$ that is defined at $z=2$. We can do this by factoring the numerator and canceling out the common factors with the denominator.\n\nNotice that the numerator $z^2 - 1$ can be factored as $(z-1)(z+1)$. So we have:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z-1)(z+1)}{z-2}$\n\nNow, we can see that there is a removable singularity at $z=2$. To find the analytic continuation, we can take the limit as $z$ approaches $2$:\n\n$\\lim_{z \\to 2} \\frac{(z-1)(z+1)}{z-2}$\n\nUsing L'Hopital's rule, since the limit is of the form $\\frac{0}{0}$, we can differentiate the numerator and denominator with respect to $z$:\n\n$\\lim_{z \\to 2} \\frac{d}{dz} \\frac{(z-1)(z+1)}{z-2} = \\lim_{z \\to 2} \\frac{(1)(z+1) + (z-1)(1)}{1}$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\n$\\lim_{z \\to 2} (2+1) + (2-1)(1) = 3+1 = 4$\n\nThus, the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the entire complex plane is given by the function:\n\n$g(z) = \\begin{cases} \n      \\frac{(z-1)(z+1)}{z-2} & z \\neq 2 \\\\\n      4 & z = 2 \n   \\end{cases}$\n\nThis function $g(z)$ is an analytic continuation of $f(z)$, as it agrees with $f(z)$ on the domain where $f(z)$ is defined and extends the function to the entire complex plane."
