    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we first need to find all the divisors of the order of G, which is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For each divisor, we will find the corresponding subgroup generated by an element of that order.\n\n1. Order 1: The subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element of G. This subgroup is cyclic since it contains only one element.\n\n2. Order 2: We need to find an element of order 2. Since G is cyclic, we know that a^12 = e. Therefore, (a^6)^2 = a^12 = e. The element a^6 has order 2, and the subgroup generated by a^6 is H_2 = {e, a^6}. This subgroup is cyclic with generator a^6.\n\n3. Order 3: We need to find an element of order 3. Since G is cyclic, a^4 has order 3 because (a^4)^3 = a^12 = e. The subgroup generated by a^4 is H_3 = {e, a^4, a^8}. This subgroup is cyclic with generator a^4.\n\n4. Order 4: We need to find an element of order 4. Since G is cyclic, a^3 has order 4 because (a^3)^4 = a^12 = e. The subgroup generated by a^3 is H_4 = {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}. This subgroup is cyclic with generator a^3.\n\n5. Order 6: We need to find an element of order 6. Since G is cyclic, a^2 has order 6 because (a^2)^6 = a^12 = e. The subgroup generated by a^2 is H_6 = {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}. This subgroup is cyclic with generator a^2.\n\n6. Order 12: The entire group G is a subgroup of itself, and it is cyclic with generator a.\n\nSo, the subgroups of G are:\n\n1. {e}\n2. {e, a^6}\n3. {e, a^4, a^8}\n4. {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}\n5. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}\n6. G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}\n\nAll of these subgroups are cyclic, as shown by their generators."
