    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point (-1, 1), we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to x. We can do this using implicit differentiation.\n\nGiven the equation x^3 + y^3 - 3xy = 0, differentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^3) + d/dx(y^3) - d/dx(3xy) = d/dx(0)\n\n3x^2 + 3y^2(dy/dx) - (3x(dy/dx) + 3y) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n3y^2(dy/dx) - 3x(dy/dx) = 3y - 3x^2\n\ndy/dx(3y^2 - 3x) = 3y - 3x^2\n\ndy/dx = (3y - 3x^2) / (3y^2 - 3x)\n\nNow, we can find the slope of the tangent line at the point (-1, 1) by plugging in the coordinates into the dy/dx equation:\n\ndy/dx = (3(1) - 3(-1)^2) / (3(1)^2 - 3(-1))\n\ndy/dx = (3 - 3) / (3 + 3)\n\ndy/dx = 0 / 6\n\ndy/dx = 0\n\nSince the slope of the tangent line is 0, the tangent line is a horizontal line. The equation of the tangent line at the point (-1, 1) is:\n\ny = 1"
