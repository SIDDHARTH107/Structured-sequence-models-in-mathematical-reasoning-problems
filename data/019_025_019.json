    "message_1": "If the temperature of a chemical reaction increases by 50°C, the rate of the reaction will double. If the temperature of the reaction was 25°C initially and we want to increase the rate of the reaction by a factor of 8, how much should we increase the temperature by?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of times we need to double the rate of the reaction as n. Since we want to increase the rate of the reaction by a factor of 8, we can write:\n\n8 = 2^n\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:\n\nlog2(8) = log2(2^n)\n3 = n\n\nSo we need to double the rate of the reaction 3 times. Since the rate doubles for every 50°C increase in temperature, we can calculate the total increase in temperature as follows:\n\nTotal increase in temperature = 3 * 50°C = 150°C\n\nTherefore, we should increase the temperature by 150°C."
