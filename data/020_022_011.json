    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $50,000 and wants to advertise their new product through TV and online ads. The cost to broadcast a TV ad is $1,000, and the cost to display an online ad is $100. Each TV ad reaches 10,000 potential customers, while each online ad reaches 1,000 potential customers. The company wants to reach at least 200,000 potential customers. What is the optimal allocation of their budget between TV and online ads that minimizes their total cost while reaching their target audience?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of TV ads and y be the number of online ads. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. Cost constraint: 1000x + 100y <= 50,000\n2. Audience constraint: 10,000x + 1,000y >= 200,000\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y >= 0\n\nWe want to minimize the total cost, which is given by the objective function:\n\nCost = 1000x + 100y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the audience constraint for y:\n\n10,000x + 1,000y >= 200,000\ny >= (200,000 - 10,000x) / 1,000\ny >= 200 - 10x\n\nNow we'll solve the cost constraint for y:\n\n1000x + 100y <= 50,000\ny <= (50,000 - 1000x) / 100\ny <= 500 - 10x\n\nSince y >= 200 - 10x and y <= 500 - 10x, we can find the feasible region for x and y. The feasible region is the set of all (x, y) values that satisfy both constraints.\n\nThe feasible region is given by:\n\n200 - 10x <= y <= 500 - 10x\n0 <= x <= 20 (since the maximum number of TV ads that can be bought with the budget is 50,000 / 1,000 = 50, and the minimum number of TV ads needed to reach 200,000 potential customers is 200,000 / 10,000 = 20)\n\nNow we'll analyze the objective function within the feasible region to find the optimal allocation.\n\nSince the cost function is linear, the optimal solution will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region. There are two vertices: (0, 200) and (20, 0).\n\nAt (0, 200), the cost is 1000 * 0 + 100 * 200 = $20,000.\nAt (20, 0), the cost is 1000 * 20 + 100 * 0 = $20,000.\n\nBoth vertices result in the same minimum cost of $20,000. Therefore, there are two optimal allocations:\n\n1. 0 TV ads and 200 online ads, with a total cost of $20,000.\n2. 20 TV ads and 0 online ads, with a total cost of $20,000.\n\nThe company can choose either of these allocations to minimize their total cost while reaching their target audience of 200,000 potential customers."
