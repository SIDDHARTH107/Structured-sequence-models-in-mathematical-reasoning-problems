    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nGiven the parametric equations x(u,v) = u^2 + v^2, y(u,v) = uv, z(u,v) = u - v^2, we can find the partial derivatives with respect to u and v:\n\nx_u = 2u, x_v = 2v\ny_u = v, y_v = u\nz_u = 1, z_v = -2v\n\nThese partial derivatives represent the tangent vectors T_u and T_v:\n\nT_u = (2u, v, 1)\nT_v = (2v, u, -2v)\n\nNow, we can find the normal vector N by taking the cross product of T_u and T_v:\n\nN = T_u × T_v = (2u*v + 2v^2, 2u^2 + 2v^2, 2u^2 - 2u*v)\n\nNow, we can compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = T_u • T_u = (2u)^2 + v^2 + 1^2 = 4u^2 + v^2 + 1\nF = T_u • T_v = 2u*2v + v*u + 1*(-2v) = 2uv - 2v\nG = T_v • T_v = (2v)^2 + u^2 + (-2v)^2 = 4v^2 + u^2 + 4v^2 = u^2 + 8v^2\n\nNext, we compute the second derivatives:\n\nx_uu = 2, x_uv = 0, x_vv = 2\ny_uu = 0, y_uv = 1, y_vv = 0\nz_uu = 0, z_uv = 0, z_vv = -2\n\nNow, we can compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = N • (x_uu, y_uu, z_uu) = (2u*v + 2v^2)(2) + (2u^2 + 2v^2)(0) + (2u^2 - 2u*v)(0) = 4u*v + 4v^2\nM = N • (x_uv, y_uv, z_uv) = (2u*v + 2v^2)(0) + (2u^2 + 2v^2)(1) + (2u^2 - 2u*v)(0) = 2u^2 + 2v^2\nN = N • (x_vv, y_vv, z_vv) = (2u*v + 2v^2)(2) + (2u^2 + 2v^2)(0) + (2u^2 - 2u*v)(-2) = 4u*v - 4u^2 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of these coefficients at the point (1,1,0). Since x(1,1) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, y(1,1) = 1*1 = 1, and z(1,1) = 1 - 1^2 = 0, we have u = 1 and v = 1.\n\nE(1,1) = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6\nF(1,1) = 2 - 2 = 0\nG(1,1) = 1 + 8 = 9\nL(1,1) = 4 + 4 = 8\nM(1,1) = 2 + 2 = 4\nN(1,1) = 4 - 4 + 4 = 4\n\nFinally, we can compute the sectional curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (8*4 - 4^2) / (6*9 - 0^2) = (32 - 16) / (54) = 16 / 54 = 8 / 27\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,0) along the curve with tangent vector (-1,1,0) and normal vector (0,0,1) is 8/27."
