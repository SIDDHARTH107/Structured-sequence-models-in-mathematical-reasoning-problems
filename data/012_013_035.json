    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction method. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of graph G with k colors.\n\n1. First, consider the edge between nodes b and d. We can either delete this edge or contract it.\n\n2. If we delete the edge between b and d, we get the following graph:\n\n```\n  a -- b -- e\n  |         |\n  c -- d    f\n```\n\nLet's call this graph G1. The chromatic polynomial of G1 is P(G1, k).\n\n3. If we contract the edge between b and d, we get the following graph:\n\n```\n  a -- b -- e\n  |    |    |\n  c         f\n```\n\nHere, b and d are merged into a single node. Let's call this graph G2. The chromatic polynomial of G2 is P(G2, k).\n\n4. Now, we need to subtract the chromatic polynomial of the graph formed by contracting the edge between b and d in G2, which is a complete graph with 3 nodes (a, c, and the merged node of b and d). Let's call this graph G3. The chromatic polynomial of G3 is P(G3, k).\n\n5. Using the deletion-contraction method, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G3, k)\n\nNow, let's find the chromatic polynomials of G1 and G3:\n\n- For G1, we have two independent edges (a-c and e-f) and one 3-cycle (a-b-e). The chromatic polynomial of G1 is:\n\nP(G1, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)\n\n- For G3, it is a complete graph with 3 nodes, so its chromatic polynomial is:\n\nP(G3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)\n\nFinally, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G3, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2) - k(k-1)(k-2)"
