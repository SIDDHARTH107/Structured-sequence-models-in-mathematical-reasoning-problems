    "message_1": "In a town, there are 8 different restaurants. You plan to visit each restaurant exactly once every week, but you want to make sure that you don't eat at the same restaurant twice in a row. In how many ways can you plan your visits to the restaurants for the next 8 weeks using Polya's enumeration theorem?",
    "message_2": "Polya's enumeration theorem is used to count the number of distinct ways to color an object under a given set of symmetries. In this case, we can think of the problem as arranging the restaurants in a circle, where each restaurant is a \"color\" and each week is a position in the circle. The symmetry group we are considering is the cyclic group of order 8, which represents rotations of the circle.\n\nLet's denote the number of ways to arrange the restaurants as N. According to Polya's enumeration theorem, we have:\n\nN = (1/|G|) * Î£ |Fix(g)|\n\nwhere |G| is the order of the group (in this case, 8), and |Fix(g)| is the number of arrangements fixed by each symmetry g in the group.\n\nFor the identity symmetry (no rotation), all 8! arrangements of the restaurants are fixed, so |Fix(g)| = 8!.\n\nFor a rotation by 1 position (1/8 of a full rotation), no arrangement is fixed, because no restaurant can appear in the same position twice in a row. Therefore, |Fix(g)| = 0.\n\nFor a rotation by 2 positions (1/4 of a full rotation), there are two \"sub-circles\" formed by the even and odd positions. Each sub-circle can be arranged in 4! ways, so |Fix(g)| = (4!)^2.\n\nFor a rotation by 3 positions, no arrangement is fixed, because a restaurant would need to appear in 3 different positions, which is not allowed. Therefore, |Fix(g)| = 0.\n\nFor a rotation by 4 positions (1/2 of a full rotation), there are two \"sub-circles\" formed by alternating positions. Each sub-circle can be arranged in 4! ways, so |Fix(g)| = (4!)^2.\n\nFor a rotation by 5, 6, or 7 positions, no arrangement is fixed for the same reason as for a rotation by 3 positions. Therefore, |Fix(g)| = 0 for these symmetries.\n\nNow we can compute N using Polya's enumeration theorem:\n\nN = (1/8) * (8! + 0 + (4!)^2 + 0 + (4!)^2 + 0 + 0 + 0)\nN = (1/8) * (8! + 2 * (4!)^2)\nN = (1/8) * (40320 + 2 * 576)\nN = (1/8) * (41472)\nN = 5184\n\nSo there are 5,184 ways to plan your visits to the restaurants for the next 8 weeks without eating at the same restaurant twice in a row."
