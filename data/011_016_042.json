    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using combinatorics. We have 14 different games, and each game consists of 2 teams playing against each other. To ensure that no two teams play against each other more than once, we need to count the number of unique pairings of teams.\n\nLet's assume there are N teams participating in the tournament. We can use the combination formula to find the number of unique pairings:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of unique pairings of 2 teams (k=2) out of N teams:\n\nC(N, 2) = N! / (2!(N-2)!)\n\nWe know that there are 14 different games, so we can set up the equation:\n\n14 = N! / (2!(N-2)!)\n\nTo solve for N, we can try different values of N and see which one satisfies the equation:\n\nFor N=5:\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10\n\nFor N=6:\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15\n\nFor N=7:\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 21\n\nFor N=8:\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28\n\nWe can see that when N=7, the number of unique pairings is 21, which is more than the required 14 games. Therefore, it is not possible to schedule 14 different games without having any two teams play against each other more than once."
