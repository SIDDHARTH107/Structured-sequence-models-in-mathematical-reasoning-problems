    "message_2": "The predicate (∀x)(∀y)(∃z)(x + z = y) states that for all values of x and y, there exists a value of z such that x + z = y. The universe of discourse is the set of integers, and the variables x and y range over the values -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTo determine the value of the predicate, we need to check if there exists a value of z for each combination of x and y that satisfies the equation x + z = y.\n\nLet's consider some examples:\n\n1. If x = -5 and y = 5, then z = 10 because -5 + 10 = 5.\n2. If x = 0 and y = 0, then z = 0 because 0 + 0 = 0.\n3. If x = 3 and y = -2, then z = -5 because 3 + (-5) = -2.\n\nAs we can see, for each combination of x and y, there exists a value of z that satisfies the equation x + z = y. This is because the set of integers is closed under addition, meaning that the sum of any two integers will always be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the value of the predicate (∀x)(∀y)(∃z)(x + z = y) is true when the universe of discourse is the set of integers and the variables x and y range over the values -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5."
