    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it gets more and more complex with each iteration (order). The length of the Peano curve increases by a factor of 3 with each order. \n\nSo, to find the length of the Peano curve of order 3, we simply multiply the length of the order 2 curve by 3:\n\nLength of order 3 curve = 8 units (order 2 length) * 3\n\nLength of order 3 curve = 24 units"
