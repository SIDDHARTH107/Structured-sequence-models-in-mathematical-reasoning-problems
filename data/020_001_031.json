    "message_1": "A company wants to produce two types of products: product A, which requires 4 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, and product B, which requires 3 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. Each unit of product A yields a profit of $300, and each unit of product B yields a profit of $200. The company has a total of 100 hours of labor available and 50 hours of machine time available. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can earn given these constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints can be written as:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 50 (machine time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit:\n\nP = 300x + 200y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 100\ny ≤ (100 - 4x)/3\n\n2x + y ≤ 50\ny ≤ 50 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect.

However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a product, they should produce 12 units of product A and 25 units of product B, which would yield a profit of:\n\nP(12, 25) = 300(12) + 200(25) = $8,400"
