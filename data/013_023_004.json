    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, one player (the \"truster\") is given $10 and can choose to transfer any amount of it to another player (the \"trustee\"). The amount transfered is then tripled and given to the trustee. The trustee can then choose to return any portion of the tripled amount to the truster. What is the optimal strategy for the truster to maximize their payout, and what is the resulting payout if both players follow optimal strategies?",
    "message_2": "In the Trust Game, the optimal strategy for the truster to maximize their payout depends on the trustee's behavior. If the trustee is completely trustworthy and will always return half of the tripled amount, the truster should transfer the entire $10. In this case, the trustee receives $30 ($10 * 3) and returns $15 to the truster, resulting in a payout of $15 for the truster.\n\nHowever, if the trustee is not trustworthy and will not return any money, the truster should not transfer any amount. In this case, the truster keeps the initial $10.\n\nIn reality, the optimal strategy for the truster depends on their beliefs about the trustee's trustworthiness and the likelihood of the trustee returning a portion of the tripled amount. If the truster believes that the trustee will return at least one-third of the tripled amount, it is worth transferring the entire $10. Otherwise, the truster should not transfer any money.\n\nThe resulting payout for the truster if both players follow optimal strategies depends on the trustee's actual behavior. If the trustee returns at least one-third of the tripled amount, the truster's payout will be greater than the initial $10. If the trustee returns less than one-third of the tripled amount or nothing at all, the truster's payout will be less than or equal to the initial $10."
