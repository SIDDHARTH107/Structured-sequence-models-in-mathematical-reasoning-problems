    "message_1": "A cylindrical tank with a diameter of 4 meters and a height of 6 meters is filled with water. Find the frequency of the first harmonic of the sound wave generated by the tank if the water's surface vibrates due to a disturbance caused by a drop of water falling into it. Assume the speed of sound in water is 1500 m/s and neglect the effect of air.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the first harmonic of the sound wave generated by the tank, we need to determine the fundamental frequency of the vibration of the water's surface. We can use the formula for the fundamental frequency of a cylindrical cavity:\n\nf = (c / 2π) * sqrt(a / h)\n\nwhere f is the fundamental frequency, c is the speed of sound in water (1500 m/s), a is the radius of the cylinder (diameter/2 = 4/2 = 2 meters), and h is the height of the cylinder (6 meters).\n\nf = (1500 / 2π) * sqrt(2 / 6)\nf ≈ (1500 / 6.2832) * sqrt(1/3)\nf ≈ 238.732 * sqrt(0.3333)\nf ≈ 238.732 * 0.5774\nf ≈ 137.76 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the first harmonic of the sound wave generated by the tank is approximately 137.76 Hz."
