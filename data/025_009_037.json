    "message_1": "Consider the moduli space of genus 2 algebraic curves. Let A be a point in this moduli space that corresponds to a smooth curve with an embedding into projective space given by a degree 4 polynomial equation. If B is another point in the moduli space corresponding to a curve with an embedding into projective space given by a degree 2 polynomial equation, how many irreducible double covers of the curve corresponding to B are there that have a ramification point over the point of the curve corresponding to A?",
    "message_2": "Let C_A be the smooth curve corresponding to point A in the moduli space, and C_B be the curve corresponding to point B. Since C_A is embedded in projective space by a degree 4 polynomial equation, it has genus 2. Similarly, C_B is embedded in projective space by a degree 2 polynomial equation, so it has genus 0 (i.e., it is a rational curve, isomorphic to the projective line).\n\nAn irreducible double cover of C_B is a curve C that is a 2-to-1 map onto C_B, with ramification points being the preimages of the branch points of the cover. Since C_B has genus 0, by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, the genus of C is given by:\n\ng(C) = 1 - n + (n - 1)/2 = 2,\n\nwhere n is the number of branch points of the cover. Solving for n, we get n = 6.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of double covers of C_B that have a ramification point over the point of C_A. Since C_A and C_B are distinct points in the moduli space, there is no natural identification of their points. However, we can consider the universal curve over the moduli space and look at the fiber product of the two curves. This will give us a curve C_AB that is a double cover of C_B and has a ramification point over the point corresponding to A.\n\nSince there are 6 branch points in the double cover, there are 2^6 = 64 possible choices for the ramification points. However, we need to account for the automorphisms of C_B (i.e., the projective transformations of the projective line), which act on the set of branch points. The group of automorphisms of C_B is PGL(2), which has order 6. Therefore, we need to divide by the size of the automorphism group to get the number of distinct double covers:\n\n64 / 6 = 10.67.\n\nHowever, this number is not an integer, which means that some of the double covers are counted with multiplicity. To resolve this issue, we can use the Hurwitz formula for the number of covers:\n\n|Aut(C_AB)| = |Aut(C_B)| * |Aut(C_A)| / |Aut(C)|,\n\nwhere Aut(C) denotes the automorphism group of a curve C. Since C_A has genus 2, its automorphism group has order at most 6, and since C_B has genus 0, its automorphism group has order 6. Therefore, the number of distinct double covers is:\n\n10.67 * 6 / 6 = 10.\n\nSo there are 10 irreducible double covers of the curve corresponding to B that have a ramification point over the point of the curve corresponding to A."
