    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the finite element method with three equally spaced nodes, we first need to discretize the domain and set up the weak form of the equation.\n\nLet the three nodes be x0 = 0, x1 = 1/2, and x2 = 1. We will use linear basis functions (also known as hat functions) for our finite element approximation. Let N0(x), N1(x), and N2(x) be the basis functions associated with nodes x0, x1, and x2, respectively.\n\nThe finite element approximation of u(x) can be written as:\n\nu(x) ≈ U0 * N0(x) + U1 * N1(x) + U2 * N2(x)\n\nwhere U0, U1, and U2 are the coefficients to be determined.\n\nThe weak form of the given PDE can be written as:\n\n∫(u'(x) * v'(x) - u(x) * v(x)) dx = ∫(x * v(x)) dx\n\nWe need to solve this equation for v(x) = N0(x), N1(x), and N2(x).\n\nFor v(x) = N0(x), the equation becomes:\n\n∫(u'(x) * N0'(x) - u(x) * N0(x)) dx = ∫(x * N0(x)) dx\n\nFor v(x) = N1(x), the equation becomes:\n\n∫(u'(x) * N1'(x) - u(x) * N1(x)) dx = ∫(x * N1(x)) dx\n\nFor v(x) = N2(x), the equation becomes:\n\n∫(u'(x) * N2'(x) - u(x) * N2(x)) dx = ∫(x * N2(x)) dx\n\nNow we need to compute the integrals and solve the resulting linear system of equations for U0, U1, and U2. After solving the system, we can substitute the values of U0, U1, and U2 back into the finite element approximation of u(x) to obtain the solution.\n\nThe final solution for u(x) will be:\n\nu(x) ≈ U0 * N0(x) + U1 * N1(x) + U2 * N2(x)\n\nSince the calculations for the integrals and solving the linear system of equations can be quite involved, it is recommended to use a numerical software package like MATLAB or Python to perform these calculations and obtain the final solution. Once the solution is obtained, it can be rounded to three decimal places as required."
