    "message_1": "Here's a possible numerical problem for the Principal-Agent Problem in Game theory:\n\nConsider a situation where a principal hires an agent to perform a task. The agent's effort level determines the outcome of the task, which is either \"good\" or \"bad\". The probability of a good outcome depends on the agent's effort level, and is given by the function P(e) = 0.5 + 0.2e, where e is the effort level on a scale from 0 to 1.\n\nThe principal and agent have different preferences regarding the outcome of the task. The principal values a good outcome at $100 and a bad outcome at $0, while the agent values a good outcome at $50 and a bad outcome at $10.\n\nThe principal can offer a contract to the agent, which specifies a payment scheme based on the outcome of the task. Specifically, the contract can offer a fixed payment of $30, regardless of the outcome, or a variable payment of $x for a good outcome and $y for a bad outcome.\n\n(a) What effort level would the agent choose if he is offered the fixed payment contract? What is the expected payoff for the agent and for the principal?\n\n(b) What effort level would the agent choose if he is offered the variable payment contract? What values of x and y would make the agent indifferent between the two effort levels? What is the expected payoff for the agent and for the principal under this contract?",
    "message_2": "(a) If the agent is offered a fixed payment contract, he will choose the effort level that maximizes his expected payoff. Since the payment is fixed, the agent will choose the lowest effort level, e = 0, to minimize his effort cost. In this case, the probability of a good outcome is P(0) = 0.5.\n\nThe expected payoff for the agent is:\n$30 (fixed payment) - 0 (effort cost) = $30\n\nThe expected payoff for the principal is:\n(0.5 * $100) + (0.5 * $0) - $30 = $50 - $30 = $20\n\n(b) If the agent is offered a variable payment contract, he will choose the effort level that maximizes his expected payoff, which depends on the values of x and y. The agent's expected payoff is:\n\n(P(e) * x + (1 - P(e)) * y) - e\n\nTo make the agent indifferent between the two effort levels, we need to find the values of x and y such that the agent's expected payoff is the same for both e = 0 and e = 1:\n\n(P(0) * x + (1 - P(0)) * y) - 0 = (P(1) * x + (1 - P(1)) * y) - 1\n\nSubstituting P(0) = 0.5 and P(1) = 0.7, we get:\n\n(0.5 * x + 0.5 * y) = (0.7 * x + 0.3 * y) - 1\n\nSolving for x and y, we get:\n\nx = $50 and y = $10\n\nUnder this contract, the agent will choose the effort level e = 1, as it maximizes his expected payoff. The expected payoff for the agent is:\n\n(0.7 * $50 + 0.3 * $10) - 1 = $35 - 1 = $34\n\nThe expected payoff for the principal is:\n(0.7 * $100) + (0.3 * $0) - (0.7 * $50 + 0.3 * $10) = $70 - $35 = $35"
