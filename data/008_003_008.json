    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -2 & 6 \\\\\n-2 & 2 & -4 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Add 2/3 times the first row to the second row to eliminate the first element in the second row.\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -2 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 4/3 & -4 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Subtract 1/3 times the first row from the third row to eliminate the first element in the third row.\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -2 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 4/3 & -4 \\\\\n0 & -1/3 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by 3/4 to make the second element in the second row equal to 1.\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -2 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -3 \\\\\n0 & -1/3 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nStep 4: Add 1/3 times the second row to the third row to eliminate the second element in the third row.\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -2 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that there are 3 non-zero rows, so the rank of the matrix A is 3."
