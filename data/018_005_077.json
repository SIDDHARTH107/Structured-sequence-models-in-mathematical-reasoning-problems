    "message_2": "First, let's identify the elements in sets A and B. \n\nSet A (prime numbers less than 10): A = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nSet B (composite numbers less than 10): B = {4, 6, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. In this case, U consists of all the natural numbers less than 10.\n\nUniversal set U: U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. In other words, A' contains all the numbers in U that are not prime numbers less than 10.\n\nSet A' (complement of A): A' = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection of set A and its complement A', denoted as A ∩ A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. \n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nBy comparing the elements in sets A and A', we can see that there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis proves that the intersection of set A (prime numbers less than 10) and its complement A' is the empty set, in accordance with the given fact that the intersection of a set and its complement is the empty set."
