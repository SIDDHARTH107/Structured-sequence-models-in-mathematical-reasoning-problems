    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs, and the probability of a single light bulb being defective is 0.05. If a customer buys a pack of 20 light bulbs, what is the probability that at least one of the light bulbs in the pack is defective?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one light bulb is defective, we can first find the probability that none of the light bulbs are defective and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single light bulb not being defective is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the light bulbs are independent events, the probability of all 20 light bulbs not being defective is (0.95)^20.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one light bulb being defective by subtracting the probability of none being defective from 1:\n\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - P(none defective) = 1 - (0.95)^20 â‰ˆ 0.3585.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the light bulbs in the pack is defective is approximately 0.3585 or 35.85%."
