    "message_2": "There are 51 groups of order 32 in total, out of which 45 are non-abelian. Among these non-abelian groups, there are six distinct types of non-abelian groups of order 32. These six groups can be represented by their presentations:\n\n1. G1 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^9⟩\n2. G2 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^5⟩\n3. G3 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^9⟩\n4. G4 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^5⟩\n5. G5 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩\n6. G6 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^8 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩\n\nNow, let's prove that every group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nLet G be a group of order 32. Since 32 = 2^5, G is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C32\n2. C16 × C2\n3. C8 × C4\n4. C8 × C2 × C2\n5. C4 × C4 × C2\n6. C4 × C2 × C2 × C2\n7. C2 × C2 × C2 × C2 × C2\n\nIf G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to one of the groups listed above. If G is non-abelian, then it cannot be isomorphic to any of the groups listed above, as they are all abelian. In this case, G must be isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32 mentioned earlier.\n\nTherefore, every group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32."
