    "message_1": "Consider the heat equation in the complex plane: \n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\nabla^2 u,$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a constant and $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. \n\nAssume that the temperature distribution $u$ in the complex plane is given by:\n\n$u(x,t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\left( x^2 - 1 \\right),$\n\nwhere $x$ is a complex number. \nFind the maximum value of $u$.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of $u$, we first need to find the critical points of the function $u(x,t)$. Since $u$ is a function of a complex variable $x$, we will treat $x$ as $x = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. \n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives of $u$ with respect to $a$ and $b$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial a} = e^{-\\alpha t} \\left( 2a \\right)$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial b} = e^{-\\alpha t} \\left( 2bi \\right)$\n\nTo find the critical points, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero:\n\n$2a = 0 \\implies a = 0$\n\n$2bi = 0 \\implies b = 0$\n\nThus, the only critical point is $x = 0$. Now, let's evaluate $u(x,t)$ at this critical point:\n\n$u(0,t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\left( 0^2 - 1 \\right) = -e^{-\\alpha t}$\n\nSince $t$ is a time variable, it is non-negative. Therefore, $e^{-\\alpha t}$ is always positive, and $-e^{-\\alpha t}$ is always negative. Thus, the maximum value of $u(x,t)$ is $0$, which occurs at $x = 0$."
