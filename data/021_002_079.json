    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial vector b0 with non-zero components.\n2. Perform the following steps iteratively:\n   a. Compute the product Ab.\n   b. Normalize the resulting vector.\n   c. Check for convergence. If the vector has converged, stop the iteration. Otherwise, continue.\n3. The dominant eigenvalue is the ratio of the components of the final vector.\n\nLet's choose the initial vector b0 as:\n\n```\n[1]\n[1]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform the power iteration method:\n\nIteration 1:\nAb = A * b0 = \n```\n[5 2] [1]   [7]\n[2 8] [1]   [10]\n```\nNormalize the vector:\n```\n[7/10]\n[1]\n```\n\nIteration 2:\nAb = A * b1 = \n```\n[5 2] [7/10]   [41/10]\n[2 8] [1]      [84/10]\n```\nNormalize the vector:\n```\n[41/84]\n[1]\n```\n\nIteration 3:\nAb = A * b2 = \n```\n[5 2] [41/84]   [337/84]\n[2 8] [1]       [680/84]\n```\nNormalize the vector:\n```\n[337/680]\n[1]\n```\n\nIteration 4:\nAb = A * b3 = \n```\n[5 2] [337/680]   [2705/680]\n[2 8] [1]         [5440/680]\n```\nNormalize the vector:\n```\n[2705/5440]\n[1]\n```\n\nWe can see that the eigenvector is converging. We can stop here and round the eigenvector to four decimal places:\n\nEigenvector:\n```\n[0.4972]\n[1]\n```\n\nNow, let's find the dominant eigenvalue using the ratio of the components of the final vector:\n\nEigenvalue = (A * eigenvector) / eigenvector\n\n```\n[5 2] [0.4972]   [2.4860]\n[2 8] [1]        [8.4972]\n```\n\nEigenvalue (λ) for the first component:\nλ = 2.4860 / 0.4972 ≈ 5.0000\n\nEigenvalue (λ) for the second component:\nλ = 8.4972 / 1 ≈ 8.4972\n\nSince the power iteration method finds the dominant eigenvalue, we choose the larger value, which is 8.4972.\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately 8.4972, and its corresponding eigenvector is approximately:\n\n```\n[0.4972]\n[1]\n```"
