    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 cm and one leg of length 6 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \"b\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe know the length of the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm and the length of one leg (a) is 6 cm. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\n6^2 + b^2 = 10^2\n\n36 + b^2 = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 36\nb^2 = 64\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg (b) is 8 cm."
