    "message_1": "A student is going on a trip and has a backpack that can carry a maximum weight of 10 kg. The student wants to bring along some snacks that come in different weights and values. The following is a list of available snacks with their weights and values:\n\n- Snack A: weight 2 kg, value $5\n- Snack B: weight 3 kg, value $8\n- Snack C: weight 4 kg, value $9\n- Snack D: weight 5 kg, value $10\n\nWhat is the maximum value of snacks that the student can bring along in their backpack without exceeding the backpack's weight limit? Use the Knapsack problem to solve the question.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Knapsack algorithm, we will create a table with rows representing the available snacks and columns representing the possible weights from 0 to the maximum weight of the backpack (10 kg). We will then fill in the table by comparing the value of adding a new snack to the value of the previous best combination of snacks for each weight.\n\nThe table will look like this:\n\n|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 0 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |10 |10 |10 |10 |15 |\n| B | 0 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 8 |13 |13 |13 |16 |18 |18 |\n| C | 0 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 9 |13 |14 |17 |18 |21 |22 |\n| D | 0 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 9 |13 |14 |17 |18 |21 |22 |\n\nThe final cell in the table (bottom-right corner) represents the maximum value of snacks the student can bring along without exceeding the backpack's weight limit, which is $22. To find the combination of snacks that achieves this value, we can trace back through the table:\n\n1. In the last row (Snack D), the value 22 is in the 10 kg column. This means Snack D is not included, as the value didn't change from the row above (Snack C).\n2. In the Snack C row, the value 22 is in the 10 kg column. This means Snack C is included, and we have 6 kg left to fill (10 kg - 4 kg).\n3. In the Snack B row, the value 13 is in the 6 kg column. This means Snack B is included, and we have 3 kg left to fill (6 kg - 3 kg).\n4. In the Snack A row, the value 5 is in the 3 kg column. This means Snack A is included, and we have 1 kg left to fill (3 kg - 2 kg).\n\nSo, the student can bring along Snack A, Snack B, and Snack C for a total value of $22 without exceeding the backpack's weight limit."
