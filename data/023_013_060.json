    "message_1": "A metal plate has initial temperature of 200 degrees Celsius. The edges of the plate are maintained at 0 degrees Celsius. After 10 minutes, the temperature distribution in the plate can be modeled as:\n\n$f(x,y) = 500e^{-20\\pi^2t}sin(2\\pi x)sin(3\\pi y)$\n\nwhere $f(x,y)$ is the temperature at point $(x,y)$ on the plate at time t in minutes. What is the temperature distribution in the plate after 20 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution in the plate after 20 minutes, we need to substitute the given time t=20 minutes into the equation:\n\n$f(x,y) = 500e^{-20\\pi^2t}sin(2\\pi x)sin(3\\pi y)$\n\nSo, for t=20 minutes:\n\n$f(x,y) = 500e^{-20\\pi^2(20)}sin(2\\pi x)sin(3\\pi y)$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$f(x,y) = 500e^{-800\\pi^2}sin(2\\pi x)sin(3\\pi y)$\n\nThis equation represents the temperature distribution in the plate after 20 minutes."
