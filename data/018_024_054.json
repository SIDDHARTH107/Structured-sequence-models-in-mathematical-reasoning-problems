    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, i.e., (A △ B). Then find the complement of each set and find the symmetric difference of their complements, i.e., [(Ac △ Bc)]. Show that (A △ B) and [(Ac △ Bc)] are not equal, thus proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as (A △ B). The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of each set. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the set. We need a universal set to define the complement. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nAc = {4, 5} (elements in U but not in A)\nBc = {1, 5} (elements in U but not in B)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of Ac and Bc, denoted as (Ac △ Bc). \n\nAc △ Bc = {1, 4}\n\nComparing the symmetric difference of A and B (A △ B) and the symmetric difference of their complements (Ac △ Bc), we see that:\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\nAc △ Bc = {1, 4}\n\nIn this case, (A △ B) and (Ac △ Bc) are equal. However, this does not prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over complement for all sets. It only shows that in this specific example, the symmetric differences are equal. To prove that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement, we would need to find an example where (A △ B) and (Ac △ Bc) are not equal."
