    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph G, we need to find a cut set, which is a set of edges whose removal would result in a disconnected graph. In this case, we can look for a vertex cut, which is a set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. \n\nObserve that vertex 2 and vertex 5 are the only vertices with a degree greater than 2. Removing vertex 2 and vertex 5 would result in the following disconnected subgraphs:\n\n- Subgraph 1: vertices {1, 3} and edges {(1, 3)}\n- Subgraph 2: vertices {4, 6, 7} and edges {(4, 6), (6, 7)}\n\nNow, we need to remove the edges that were connected to vertices 2 and 5. These edges are:\n\n- (1, 2)\n- (2, 3)\n- (2, 4)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 5)\n- (4, 5)\n- (5, 6)\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph G is 7."
