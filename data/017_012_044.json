    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphism classes for groups of order 16, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. Since 16 = 2^4, the possible structures for abelian groups of order 16 are:\n\n1. Z_16 (cyclic)\n2. Z_8 × Z_2\n3. Z_4 × Z_4\n4. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2\n5. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\n\nNow, let's determine which of these groups are cyclic, dihedral, and non-abelian.\n\n1. Z_16 is cyclic by definition.\n\n2. Z_8 × Z_2 is not cyclic, as the orders of the elements in Z_8 and Z_2 are 8 and 2, respectively. The least common multiple of these orders is 8, which is less than 16. Therefore, this group cannot be cyclic. It is also not dihedral, as dihedral groups have a specific structure that is not satisfied by direct products of cyclic groups. Since it is a direct product of abelian groups, it is abelian.\n\n3. Z_4 × Z_4 is not cyclic for similar reasons as Z_8 × Z_2. The orders of the elements in Z_4 are 4, and the least common multiple of these orders is 4, which is less than 16. Therefore, this group cannot be cyclic. It is also not dihedral and is abelian.\n\n4. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2 is not cyclic, as the least common multiple of the orders of the elements in Z_4, Z_2, and Z_2 is 4, which is less than 16. Therefore, this group cannot be cyclic. It is also not dihedral and is abelian.\n\n5. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 is not cyclic, as the least common multiple of the orders of the elements in Z_2 is 2, which is less than 16. Therefore, this group cannot be cyclic. It is also not dihedral and is abelian.\n\nNow, let's consider non-abelian groups of order 16. The only non-abelian group of order 16 is the dihedral group D_8, which has 8 reflections and 8 rotations. This group is non-abelian and dihedral.\n\nIn summary, the isomorphism classes for groups of order 16 are:\n\n1. Z_16 (cyclic)\n2. Z_8 × Z_2 (abelian)\n3. Z_4 × Z_4 (abelian)\n4. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2 (abelian)\n5. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 (abelian)\n6. D_8 (non-abelian, dihedral)"
