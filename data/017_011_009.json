    "message_2": "To show that G must contain an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of an element divides the order of the group (Lagrange's Theorem).\n2. If a group has an element of order n, then it has a subgroup of order n.\n\nFirst, let's show that G must contain an element of order 2. By Cauchy's theorem, if the prime number p divides the order of a group, then the group has an element of order p. Since 12 = 2^2 * 3, the prime number 2 divides the order of G. Therefore, by Cauchy's theorem, G must contain an element of order 2.\n\nNow, let's show that G must contain an element of order 3. Since 12 = 2^2 * 3, the prime number 3 also divides the order of G. Therefore, by Cauchy's theorem, G must contain an element of order 3.\n\nNow that we have shown that G contains elements of order 2 and 3, let's consider the possible structures of G. There are three non-isomorphic groups of order 12: the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, and the dihedral group D6.\n\n1. C12: This is the cyclic group of order 12, generated by an element of order 12. Since 2 and 3 both divide 12, C12 contains elements of order 2 and 3.\n\n2. A4: This is the alternating group on 4 elements, which has order 12. A4 contains three elements of order 2 (the product of two disjoint 2-cycles) and eight elements of order 3 (3-cycles). Therefore, A4 contains elements of order 2 and 3.\n\n3. D6: This is the dihedral group of order 12, which is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon. D6 contains six elements of order 2 (reflections) and two elements of order 6 (rotations). Since 2 and 3 both divide 6, D6 contains elements of order 2 and 3.\n\nSince G contains elements of order 2 and 3, and there are only three non-isomorphic groups of order 12 (C12, A4, and D6) that contain elements of order 2 and 3, G must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6."
