    "message_2": "The higher-order logical formula ∃F∀x(Fx ↔ x>3) can be interpreted as follows: There exists a function F such that for all x in the set of real numbers, F(x) is true if and only if x > 3.\n\nIn this case, the truth value of the formula is true. This is because we can define a function F(x) that satisfies the given condition. For example, we can define F(x) as a function that returns true if x > 3 and false otherwise. Since such a function exists, the formula is true."
