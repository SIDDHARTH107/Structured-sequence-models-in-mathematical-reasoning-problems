    "message_1": "What is the area of a sector with a central angle of 45 degrees and a radius of 8 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle/360) × π × r²\n\nwhere the central angle is in degrees and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 45 degrees and the radius is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (45/360) × π × 8²\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × π × 64\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × 64π\n\nArea of sector = 8π\n\nSo, the area of the sector is 8π square centimeters."
