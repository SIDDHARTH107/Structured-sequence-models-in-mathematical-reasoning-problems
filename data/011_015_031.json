    "message_2": "Let's consider each person at the party as a node in a graph, and each handshake as an edge connecting two nodes. Since each person shakes hands with exactly 3 other people, each node will have a degree of 3.\n\nThe sum of the degrees of all nodes in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (handshakes) in the graph. This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two nodes.\n\nLet H be the number of handshakes. Then, the sum of the degrees of all nodes is 6 * 3 = 18, since there are 6 people and each has a degree of 3. Therefore, 2 * H = 18, and H = 9.\n\nSo, the minimum number of handshakes that occur at the party is 9."
