    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize its profit by producing and selling two types of products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time to produce, while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time to produce.\n\nThe company has 400 hours of labor and 600 hours of machine time available in a week. Each unit of Product A sells for $10 and each unit of Product B sells for $15.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can make in a week, subject to the available hours of labor and machine time?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 400 (labor constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 600 (machine constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 400\ny ≤ (400 - 3x)/2\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 600\ny ≤ (600 - 2x)/4\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 150), (200, 0), and (100, 100).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 150) = 10(0) + 15(150) = $2250\nP(200, 0) = 10(200) + 15(0) = $2000\nP(100, 100) = 10(100) + 15(100) = $2500\n\nThe maximum profit is $2500, which occurs when the company produces 100 units of Product A and 100 units of Product B."
