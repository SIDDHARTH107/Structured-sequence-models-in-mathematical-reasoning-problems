    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x² + 5x - 2, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nThe antiderivative F(x) is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x² + 5x - 2) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x²) dx + ∫(5x) dx - ∫(2) dx\n\nNow, we apply the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), where n is a constant:\n\nF(x) = (3/3)x^(2+1) + (5/2)x^(1+1) - 2x^(0+1) + C\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nF(x) = x^3 + (5/2)x^2 - 2x + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x² + 5x - 2 is F(x) = x^3 + (5/2)x^2 - 2x + C, where C is the constant of integration."
