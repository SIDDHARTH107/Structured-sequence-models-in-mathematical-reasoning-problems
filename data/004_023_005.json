    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x in the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting y = x^2 equal to y = 2x and solving for x:\n\nx^2 = 2x\n\nx^2 - 2x = 0\n\nx(x - 2) = 0\n\nx = 0 or x = 2\n\nSo the points of intersection are (0, 0) and (2, 4).\n\nNow we'll find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2)dx from 0 to 2\n\nTo integrate, we'll use the power rule:\n\n∫(2x - x^2)dx = x^2 - (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\n[x^2 - (1/3)x^3] from 0 to 2\n\n= (2^2 - (1/3)(2^3)) - (0^2 - (1/3)(0^3))\n= (4 - (8/3)) - 0\n= 4 - 8/3\n= (12 - 8)/3\n= 4/3\n\nSo the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x in the interval [0, 2] is 4/3 square units."
