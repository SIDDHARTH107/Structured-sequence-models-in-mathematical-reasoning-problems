    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^2 + 1 from x = 0 to x = 2, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx):\n\ny = x^2 + 1\ndy/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 2] √(1 + (2x)^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 2] √(1 + 4x^2) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's use the substitution:\n\nu = 2x\ndu/dx = 2\ndx = du/2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] (1/2)√(1 + u^2) du\n\nNow, we can use the trigonometric substitution:\n\nu = tan(θ)\ndu = sec^2(θ) dθ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nL = (1/2) ∫ sec^3(θ) dθ\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet v = sec(θ), dv = sec(θ)tan(θ) dθ\nLet w = sec^2(θ) dθ, dw = 2sec(θ)tan(θ) dθ\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫vw = v∫w - ∫(dv∫w)\n\nL = (1/2) [sec(θ)sec^2(θ) - ∫(sec(θ)tan(θ) * 2sec(θ)tan(θ) dθ)]\n\nL = (1/2) [sec(θ)sec^2(θ) - 2∫(sec^2(θ)tan^2(θ) dθ)]\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean identity:\n\ntan^2(θ) = sec^2(θ) - 1\n\nL = (1/2) [sec(θ)sec^2(θ) - 2∫(sec^2(θ)(sec^2(θ) - 1) dθ)]\n\nL = (1/2) [sec(θ)sec^2(θ) - 2∫(sec^4(θ) - sec^2(θ)) dθ]\n\nNow, we can split the integral:\n\nL = (1/2) [sec(θ)sec^2(θ) - 2(∫sec^4(θ) dθ - ∫sec^2(θ) dθ)]\n\nThe integral of sec^2(θ) is tan(θ), and the integral of sec^4(θ) is a bit more complicated, but it can be found to be (1/3)tan(θ)sec^2(θ) - (2/3)tan(θ).\n\nL = (1/2) [sec(θ)sec^2(θ) - 2((1/3)tan(θ)sec^2(θ) - (2/3)tan(θ) - tan(θ))]\n\nNow, we need to convert back to the original variable x:\n\nθ = arctan(u/2)\nsec(θ) = √(1 + (u/2)^2)\ntan(θ) = u/2\n\nL = (1/2) [√(1 + (u/2)^2) * (u/2)^2 - 2((1/3)(u/2) * (u/2)^2 - (2/3)(u/2) - (u/2))]\n\nNow, we need to convert back to the original variable x:\n\nu = 2x\n\nL = (1/2) [√(1 + x^2) * x^2 - 2((1/3)x * x^2 - (2/3)x - x)]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral from x = 0 to x = 2:\n\nL = (1/2) [√(1 + 4) * 4 - 2((1/3) * 2 * 4 - (2/3) * 2 - 2)] - (1/2) [√(1 + 0) * 0 - 2((1/3) * 0 * 0 - (2/3) * 0 - 0)]\n\nL ≈ 6.324\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^2 + 1 from x = 0 to x = 2 is approximately 6.324."
