    "message_2": "To solve this quadratic optimization problem using semi-definite programming, we first need to rewrite the objective function in a matrix form and then express the problem as a semi-definite program.\n\nThe objective function can be written as:\n\nf(x) = x^T Q x\n\nwhere x = [x₁, x₂]^T and Q is a symmetric matrix. To find Q, we can rewrite the objective function as:\n\nf(x) = 5x₁² + 5x₂² - 4x₁x₂ = [x₁, x₂] * [5, -2; -2, 5] * [x₁; x₂]\n\nSo, Q = [5, -2; -2, 5].\n\nNow, we can express the problem as a semi-definite program:\n\nmaximize Tr(QX)\n\nsubject to the constraints:\n\nX = [x₁, x₂; x₁, x₂] is a positive semi-definite matrix (X ≥ 0)\nTr(A₁X) ≤ b₁, where A₁ = [1, 0; 0, 1] and b₁ = 4\nX diagonal elements are non-negative (x₁, x₂ ≥ 0)\n\nNow, we can solve this semi-definite program using a semi-definite programming solver. However, this problem can also be solved analytically.\n\nThe constraint x₁ + x₂ ≤ 4 can be rewritten as x₂ ≤ 4 - x₁. Since f(x) is a quadratic function, its maximum value will occur at the boundary of the feasible region. We can analyze the boundary by considering the following cases:\n\n1. x₁ = 0: In this case, x₂ ≤ 4, and f(x) = 5x₂². The maximum value occurs when x₂ = 4, and f(x) = 5(4)² = 80.\n\n2. x₂ = 0: In this case, x₁ ≤ 4, and f(x) = 5x₁². The maximum value occurs when x₁ = 4, and f(x) = 5(4)² = 80.\n\n3. x₂ = 4 - x₁: In this case, f(x) = 5x₁² + 5(4 - x₁)² - 4x₁(4 - x₁). Taking the derivative with respect to x₁ and setting it to 0, we get:\n\ndf/dx₁ = 10x₁ - 10(4 - x₁) - 4(4 - x₁) = 0\n\nSolving for x₁, we get x₁ = 2. Then x₂ = 4 - x₁ = 2. So, f(x) = 5(2)² + 5(2)² - 4(2)(2) = 40.\n\nComparing the maximum values obtained in each case, we find that the maximum value of f(x) is 80, which occurs when x₁ = 0 and x₂ = 4, or when x₁ = 4 and x₂ = 0."
