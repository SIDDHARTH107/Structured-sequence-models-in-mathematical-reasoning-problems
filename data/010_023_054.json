    "message_1": "Consider a simple closed curve in the plane which is not contractible. Let L be the length of this curve. If we continuously change this curve without breaking it until it becomes knotted, what is the minimum length that this knotted curve can have?",
    "message_2": "To answer this question, we need to consider the simplest non-trivial knot, which is the trefoil knot. The trefoil knot can be formed by taking a simple closed curve and manipulating it without breaking it.\n\nThe minimum length of a knotted curve can be determined by considering the ideal rope configuration for the trefoil knot. In this configuration, the rope forms a series of straight segments connected by semi-circular bends. There are six straight segments and six semi-circular bends in the ideal trefoil knot.\n\nLet r be the radius of the semi-circular bends. The length of each straight segment is then 2r, and the length of each semi-circular bend is πr. The total length L of the knotted curve is given by:\n\nL = 6(2r) + 6(πr) = 12r + 6πr\n\nTo minimize the length L, we need to minimize the radius r. However, r cannot be zero, as the curve would no longer be a knot. Therefore, we can only approach the minimum length asymptotically as r approaches zero.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no strict minimum length for a knotted curve, but the length approaches a minimum value as the radius of the semi-circular bends approaches zero. The minimum length of a knotted curve is determined by the ideal configuration of the simplest non-trivial knot, the trefoil knot, and depends on the radius of the semi-circular bends."
