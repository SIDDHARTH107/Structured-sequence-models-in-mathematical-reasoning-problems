    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x^2 - 9x + 18, we need to find two binomials of the form (x - a)(x - b) such that the product of a and b is equal to the constant term (18) and the sum of a and b is equal to the coefficient of the linear term (-9).\n\nLet's find two numbers that multiply to 18 and add up to -9:\n\n-1 * -18 = 18, but -1 + (-18) = -19 (not -9)\n-2 * -9 = 18, but -2 + (-9) = -11 (not -9)\n-3 * -6 = 18, and -3 + (-6) = -9 (this works)\n\nSo, the two numbers we are looking for are -3 and -6. Therefore, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 6)"
