    "message_1": "Suppose there is a company with 100 employees and the probability of any given employee committing financial fraud is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 5 employees in the company will commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 employees commit financial fraud, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that fewer than 5 employees commit financial fraud. We can then subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 employees committing financial fraud.\n\nLet X be the number of employees committing financial fraud. We want to find P(X ≥ 5). We can use the complementary probability: P(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - P(X ≤ 4).\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate P(X ≤ 4):\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of employees (100), p is the probability of an employee committing financial fraud (0.05), and k is the number of employees committing financial fraud.\n\nP(X ≤ 4) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nWe can calculate each term:\n\nP(X = 0) = (100 choose 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.95^100 ≈ 0.00592\n\nP(X = 1) = (100 choose 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1) = 100 * 0.05 * 0.95^99 ≈ 0.03116\n\nP(X = 2) = (100 choose 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2) ≈ 0.08118\n\nP(X = 3) = (100 choose 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3) ≈ 0.13956\n\nP(X = 4) = (100 choose 4) * 0.05^4 * (1-0.05)^(100-4) ≈ 0.17829\n\nNow, we can add these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 4) = 0.00592 + 0.03116 + 0.08118 + 0.13956 + 0.17829 ≈ 0.43611\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 5 employees committing financial fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X ≤ 4) = 1 - 0.43611 ≈ 0.56389\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 employees in the company will commit financial fraud is approximately 0.56389 or 56.39%."
