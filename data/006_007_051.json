    "message_1": "A stock has a 60% chance of increasing in price by 5% and a 40% chance of decreasing by 3%. What is the probability of the stock price increasing overall?",
    "message_2": "To find the overall expected change in the stock price, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected change = (Probability of increase * Increase amount) + (Probability of decrease * Decrease amount)\n\nExpected change = (0.60 * 5%) + (0.40 * -3%)\n\nExpected change = (0.60 * 0.05) + (0.40 * -0.03)\n\nExpected change = 0.03 + (-0.012)\n\nExpected change = 0.018\n\nSince the expected change is positive (0.018 or 1.8%), the probability of the stock price increasing overall is greater than 50%. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified model and doesn't account for other factors that may influence the stock price."
