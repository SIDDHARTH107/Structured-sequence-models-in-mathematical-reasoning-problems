    "message_1": "A bird is sitting on a tree branch, 20 meters above the ground. You are standing 30 meters away from the base of the tree. What is the distance between you and the bird? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the distance between you and the bird as d (the hypotenuse), the horizontal distance between you and the tree as a (30 meters), and the vertical distance between the ground and the bird as b (20 meters).\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nd^2 = (30)^2 + (20)^2\nd^2 = 900 + 400\nd^2 = 1300\n\nNow, find the square root of 1300 to get the value of d:\n\nd = √1300 ≈ 36.06\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the distance between you and the bird is approximately 36 meters."
