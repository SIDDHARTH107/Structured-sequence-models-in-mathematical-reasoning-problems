    "message_1": "In a certain country, the probability of a citizen supporting a particular political party is 0.35. If 100 citizens are randomly selected, what is the probability that at least 40 of them support the party?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, citizens supporting the party) in n trials (in this case, 100 citizens)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.35)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 40)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 40 citizens supporting the party, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 40, 41, 42, ..., 100.\n\nP(X >= 40) = P(X = 40) + P(X = 41) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nCalculating each term in the sum and adding them together can be quite tedious. Instead, we can use a complementary probability approach. We can find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., fewer than 40 citizens supporting the party) and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X >= 40) = 1 - P(X < 40) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 39))\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 39 using the binomial probability formula and subtract it from 1.\n\nUsing a calculator or software that can handle binomial probabilities, we find:\n\nP(X < 40) ≈ 0.9531\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least 40 citizens supporting the party is:\n\nP(X >= 40) = 1 - P(X < 40) ≈ 1 - 0.9531 ≈ 0.0469\n\nSo, the probability that at least 40 of the 100 randomly selected citizens support the party is approximately 0.0469 or 4.69%."
