    "message_1": "A cylindrical coaxial cable has an inner radius of 0.5 cm and an outer radius of 1.0 cm. The current through the cable is 5 A and the cable is made of copper with resistivity of 1.72 x 10^-8 Ω·m. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the cable at a radial distance of 0.75 cm from the center?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the cable at a radial distance of 0.75 cm from the center, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a cylindrical coaxial cable, we can consider a circular loop of radius r (0.75 cm) inside the cable. The magnetic field will be tangential to this loop, and its magnitude will be constant along the loop. Therefore, we can write Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWe need to find the current enclosed by the loop (I_enclosed). Since the total current (5 A) is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area of the cable, we can find the current density (J) as:\n\nJ = I / A_total\n\nThe total area of the cable (A_total) is the difference between the areas of the outer and inner circles:\n\nA_total = π(R_outer^2 - R_inner^2) = π(1^2 - 0.5^2) = π(1 - 0.25) = 0.75π cm²\n\nNow, we can find the current density:\n\nJ = 5 A / 0.75π cm² ≈ 2.122 A/cm²\n\nNext, we need to find the area enclosed by the loop of radius 0.75 cm (A_enclosed):\n\nA_enclosed = πr^2 = π(0.75^2) = 0.5625π cm²\n\nNow, we can find the enclosed current (I_enclosed):\n\nI_enclosed = J * A_enclosed ≈ 2.122 A/cm² * 0.5625π cm² ≈ 3.75 A\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the magnetic field (B) using Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\nB = (μ₀I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A. We need to convert the radius (r) to meters:\n\nr = 0.75 cm = 0.0075 m\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T·m/A * 3.75 A) / (2π * 0.0075 m) ≈ 1.25 × 10^-5 T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field inside the cable at a radial distance of 0.75 cm from the center is approximately 1.25 × 10^-5 T."
