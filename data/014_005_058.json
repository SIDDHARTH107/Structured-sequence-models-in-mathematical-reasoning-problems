    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we first need to find the private key (d) using the given public key (n, e) = (323, 7). Here, n = p * q = 17 * 11 = 323.\n\n1. Compute φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (17-1)(11-1) = 16 * 10 = 160.\n\n2. Find the modular multiplicative inverse (d) of e (7) modulo φ(n) (160). In other words, we need to find a number d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1.\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 23.\n\nNow that we have the private key (n, d) = (323, 23), we can decrypt the message. However, you haven't provided the encrypted message. If you provide the encrypted message (ciphertext), we can proceed with the decryption process."
