    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal, also known as the Vicsek snowflake, is a self-similar fractal generated by iteratively replacing each square in a grid with a pattern of five smaller squares. \n\nTo calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, N = 5 (since each square is replaced by 5 smaller squares), and the scaling factor s = 3 (since each side of the smaller squares is 1/3 the length of the original square's side).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.46497."
