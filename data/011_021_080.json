The distances (in kilometers) between each pair of cities are as follows: city 1 to city 2 - 8 km, city 1 to city 3 - 12 km, city 1 to city 4 - 10 km, city 1 to city 5 - 15 km, city 2 to city 3 - 14 km, city 2 to city 4 - 5 km, city 2 to city 5 - 6 km, city 3 to city 4 - 7 km, city 3 to city 5 - 8 km, and city 4 to city 5 - 11 km. What is the shortest possible distance the salesperson can travel to visit all of the cities and return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for all possible routes and choose the one with the shortest distance. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) = 120 possible routes. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5 to eliminate duplicates, leaving us with 24 unique routes.\n\nHere are the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1. 1-2-3-4-5-1: 8+14+7+11+15 = 55 km\n2. 1-2-3-5-4-1: 8+14+8+11+10 = 51 km\n3. 1-2-4-3-5-1: 8+5+7+8+15 = 43 km\n4. 1-2-4-5-3-1: 8+5+11+8+12 = 44 km\n5. 1-2-5-3-4-1: 8+6+8+7+10 = 39 km\n6. 1-2-5-4-3-1: 8+6+11+7+12 = 44 km\n7. 1-3-2-4-5-1: 12+14+5+11+15 = 57 km\n8. 1-3-2-5-4-1: 12+14+6+11+10 = 53 km\n9. 1-3-4-2-5-1: 12+7+5+6+15 = 45 km\n10. 1-3-4-5-2-1: 12+7+11+6+8 = 44 km\n11. 1-3-5-2-4-1: 12+8+6+5+10 = 41 km\n12. 1-3-5-4-2-1: 12+8+11+5+8 = 44 km\n13. 1-4-2-3-5-1: 10+5+14+8+15 = 52 km\n14. 1-4-2-5-3-1: 10+5+6+8+12 = 41 km\n15. 1-4-3-2-5-1: 10+7+14+6+15 = 52 km\n16. 1-4-3-5-2-1: 10+7+8+6+8 = 39 km\n17. 1-4-5-2-3-1: 10+11+6+14+12 = 53 km\n18. 1-4-5-3-2-1: 10+11+8+14+8 = 51 km\n19. 1-5-2-3-4-1: 15+6+14+7+10 = 52 km\n20. 1-5-2-4-3-1: 15+6+5+7+12 = 45 km\n21. 1-5-3-2-4-1: 15+8+14+5+10 = 52 km\n22. 1-5-3-4-2-1: 15+8+7+5+8 = 43 km\n23. 1-5-4-2-3-1: 15+11+5+14+12 = 57 km\n24. 1-5-4-3-2-1: 15+11+7+14+8 = 55 km\n\nThe shortest possible distance is 39 km, which can be achieved by following the route 1-2-5-3-4-1 or 1-4-3-5-2-1."
