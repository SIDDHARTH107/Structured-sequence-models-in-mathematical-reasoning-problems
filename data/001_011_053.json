    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we first find a common denominator for all the fractions, which is the product of the unique factors of the denominators: $(x+1)(x-2)(x^2-1)$. Note that $(x^2-1)$ can be factored as $(x+1)(x-1)$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation with the common denominator:\n\n$\\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x+1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-2)(x^2-1)} + \\frac{2(x+1)(x-1)(x+1)}{(x+1)(x-2)(x^2-1)} = \\frac{3x(x+1)(x-2)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-2)(x^2-1)}$\n\nSince all the fractions have the same denominator, we can equate the numerators:\n\n$(x-1)(x-2)(x+1)(x-1) + 2(x+1)(x-1)(x+1) = 3x(x+1)(x-2)(x-1)$\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by canceling out the common factors on both sides:\n\n$(x-2)(x+1) + 2(x+1) = 3x$\n\nNow distribute and combine like terms:\n\n$x^2 - x - 2 + 2x + 2 = 3x$\n\n$x^2 + x - 2 = 3x$\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n\n$x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = -2$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2}$\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\n$x = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{12}}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{12}}{2}$"
