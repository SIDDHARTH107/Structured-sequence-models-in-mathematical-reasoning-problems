    "message_1": "Consider the Vigenere cipher with a key length of 6 letters. If the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" is encrypted using the key \"FIBONA\", what is the resulting ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenère cipher with the key \"FIBONA\", we first need to repeat the key to match the length of the plaintext message. In this case, the key becomes \"FIBONAFIBO\".\n\nNow, we can use the Vigenère cipher table to encrypt each letter of the plaintext message using the corresponding letter of the extended key. The Vigenère cipher table is a 26x26 table of alphabets, where each row is shifted one position to the left compared to the row above it.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter:\n\n1. M (plaintext) + F (key) = R (ciphertext)\n2. A + I = I\n3. T + B = V\n4. H + O = X\n5. E + N = S\n6. M + A = M\n7. A + F = F\n8. T + I = Y\n9. I + B = K\n10. C + O = W\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext for the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the key \"FIBONA\" is \"RIVXSMFYKW\"."
