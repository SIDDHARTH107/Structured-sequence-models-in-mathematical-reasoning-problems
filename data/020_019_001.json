    "message_1": "A sailboat is sailing at a constant speed of 10 knots in still water. If the boat needs to travel directly across a river with a current flowing at a rate of 2 knots, at what angle must the boat be steered in order to arrive at a destination directly across the river in the shortest possible time? Assume that the sailboat's speed relative to the water is always perpendicular to the river's current. Calculate the optimal angle to steer the boat to minimize the time of crossing.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the angle between the boat's direction and the river's current as θ. The boat's velocity relative to the water can be broken down into two components: one parallel to the river's current (v_parallel) and one perpendicular to the river's current (v_perpendicular).\n\nv_parallel = 10 * cos(θ)\nv_perpendicular = 10 * sin(θ)\n\nSince the boat's speed relative to the water is always perpendicular to the river's current, v_parallel must be equal to the river's current speed, which is 2 knots.\n\n2 = 10 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ:\n\ncos(θ) = 2/10\ncos(θ) = 1/5\n\nθ = arccos(1/5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 78.46°\n\nSo, the optimal angle to steer the boat to minimize the time of crossing is approximately 78.46° relative to the river's current."
