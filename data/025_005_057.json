    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve $C: x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$ and find the points where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet $F(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz$. Then the partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3xz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 3z^2 - 3xy$\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3yz = 0$\n\n$3y^2 - 3xz = 0$\n\n$3z^2 - 3xy = 0$\n\nDivide each equation by 3:\n\n$x^2 - yz = 0$\n\n$y^2 - xz = 0$\n\n$z^2 - xy = 0$\n\nNow we can analyze the equations:\n\n1. If $x = 0$, then from the third equation, $z^2 = 0$, so $z = 0$. But in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we cannot have $x = y = z = 0$. So, $x \\neq 0$.\n\n2. If $y = 0$, then from the second equation, $x^2 = 0$, so $x = 0$. But we just concluded that $x \\neq 0$. So, $y \\neq 0$.\n\n3. If $z = 0$, then from the first equation, $x^2 = 0$, so $x = 0$. But we just concluded that $x \\neq 0$. So, $z \\neq 0$.\n\nSince $x, y, z \\neq 0$, we can divide the first equation by $x^2$, the second equation by $y^2$, and the third equation by $z^2$:\n\n$1 - \\frac{y}{x}\\frac{z}{x} = 0$\n\n$1 - \\frac{x}{y}\\frac{z}{y} = 0$\n\n$1 - \\frac{x}{z}\\frac{y}{z} = 0$\n\nLet $a = \\frac{y}{x}$ and $b = \\frac{z}{x}$. Then the first equation becomes:\n\n$1 - ab = 0 \\Rightarrow ab = 1$\n\nSimilarly, let $c = \\frac{x}{y}$ and $d = \\frac{z}{y}$, and $e = \\frac{x}{z}$ and $f = \\frac{y}{z}$. Then we have:\n\n$cd = 1$\n\n$ef = 1$\n\nNow, notice that $a = \\frac{1}{c}$, $b = \\frac{1}{e}$, and $d = \\frac{1}{f}$. So we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{c} \\cdot \\frac{1}{e} = 1$\n\n$\\frac{1}{e} \\cdot \\frac{1}{f} = 1$\n\n$\\frac{1}{c} \\cdot \\frac{1}{f} = 1$\n\nSince $ab = cd = ef = 1$, we have $a = b = c = d = e = f = 1$. Thus:\n\n$\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{z}{x} = \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{z}{y} = \\frac{x}{z} = \\frac{y}{z} = 1$\n\nThis implies that $x = y = z$. So the only singular point of the curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is $[1:1:1]$."
