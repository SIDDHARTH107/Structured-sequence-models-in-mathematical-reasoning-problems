    "message_1": "Suppose that you have a set of three dice with sides numbered from 1 to 6. You roll each die once.\n\n(a) What is the probability that the sum of the rolls is odd?\n(b) What is the probability that at least one of the rolls is a 3?\n(c) What is the probability that the sum of the rolls is even and at least one of the rolls is a 4?",
    "message_2": "(a) To get an odd sum, there must be an odd number of odd numbers rolled. There are two possibilities: either one die shows an odd number and the other two show even numbers, or all three dice show odd numbers.\n\nThere are 3 ways to choose which die shows the odd number, and for each choice, there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) for the other two dice. So there are 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ways to get one odd and two even numbers.\n\nThere is only 1 way to choose all three dice to show odd numbers, and for each die, there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5). So there are 1 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ways to get three odd numbers.\n\nIn total, there are 27 + 27 = 54 ways to get an odd sum. There are 6^3 = 216 possible outcomes when rolling three dice, so the probability of getting an odd sum is 54/216 = 1/4.\n\n(b) To find the probability that at least one of the rolls is a 3, we can use the complementary probability: the probability that none of the rolls is a 3. For each die, there are 5 outcomes that are not a 3 (1, 2, 4, 5, 6). So there are 5^3 = 125 ways to roll the dice without getting a 3. The probability of not getting a 3 is 125/216. Therefore, the probability of getting at least one 3 is 1 - 125/216 = 91/216.\n\n(c) To find the probability that the sum of the rolls is even and at least one of the rolls is a 4, we can use the following approach:\n\nFirst, find the probability of getting an even sum. There are two possibilities: either all three dice show even numbers, or two dice show odd numbers and one die shows an even number.\n\nThere is only 1 way to choose all three dice to show even numbers, and for each die, there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6). So there are 1 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ways to get three even numbers.\n\nThere are 3 ways to choose which die shows the even number, and for each choice, there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) for the other two dice and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) for the chosen die. So there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81 ways to get two odd and one even number.\n\nIn total, there are 27 + 81 = 108 ways to get an even sum. The probability of getting an even sum is 108/216 = 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of getting an even sum with at least one 4. There are 3 ways to choose which die shows the 4, and for each choice, there are 2 even numbers (2, 6) for the other two dice. So there are 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 ways to get three even numbers with at least one 4.\n\nFor the case of two odd and one even number with at least one 4, there are 3 ways to choose which die shows the 4, and for each choice, there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) for the other two dice. So there are 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ways to get two odd and one even number with at least one 4.\n\nIn total, there are 12 + 27 = 39 ways to get an even sum with at least one 4. The probability of getting an even sum with at least one 4 is 39/216 = 13/72."
