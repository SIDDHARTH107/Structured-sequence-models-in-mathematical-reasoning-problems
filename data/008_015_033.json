    "message_2": "To use Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system of equations in the form Ax = b, where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix, x is the vector of unknowns, and b is the vector of constants. Our system of equations can be written as:\n\nA = |  2  1 -1 |\n    |  1  3  1 |\n    | -1  2  4 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 5 |\n    | 8 |\n    | 4 |\n\nNow we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. We want to find a lower triangular matrix L such that A = L * L^T, where L^T is the transpose of L.\n\nL = | l11  0   0  |\n    | l21 l22  0  |\n    | l31 l32 l33 |\n\nWe can find the elements of L using the following equations:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(2)\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 1 / sqrt(2)\nl31 = a31 / l11 = -1 / sqrt(2)\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(3 - 1/2) = sqrt(5/2)\nl32 = (a32 - l31*l21) / l22 = (2 + 1/2) / sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5/2)\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(4 - 1/2 - 5/2) = sqrt(1)\n\nSo, L = |  sqrt(2)    0       0   |\n         | 1/sqrt(2) sqrt(5/2)  0   |\n         | -1/sqrt(2) sqrt(5/2)  1   |\n\nNow we will solve the system L * y = b for y:\n\n|  sqrt(2)    0       0   | | y1 |   | 5 |\n| 1/sqrt(2) sqrt(5/2)  0   | | y2 | = | 8 |\n| -1/sqrt(2) sqrt(5/2)  1   | | y3 |   | 4 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 5 / sqrt(2) = 5/sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 5sqrt(2)/2\ny2 = (8 - 1/sqrt(2) * y1) / sqrt(5/2) = (8 - 5/2) / sqrt(5/2) = 3sqrt(5/2)/2\ny3 = 4 - sqrt(5/2) * y2 = 4 - 3/2 = 5/2\n\nNow we will solve the system L^T * x = y for x:\n\n|  sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) | | x |   | 5sqrt(2)/2 |\n|    0    sqrt(5/2)  sqrt(5/2)  | | y | = | 3sqrt(5/2)/2 |\n|    0       0          1       | | z |   |     5/2     |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx = 5sqrt(2)/2 / sqrt(2) = 5/2\ny = (3sqrt(5/2)/2 - sqrt(5/2) * x) / sqrt(5/2) = (3/2 - 5/2) = -1\nz = 5/2\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = 5/2, y = -1, and z = 5/2."
