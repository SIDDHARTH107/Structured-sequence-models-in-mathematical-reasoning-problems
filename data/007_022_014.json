The general equation for an elliptic curve is given by:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + ax + b (mod 7)\n\nWe can use the points P, Q, and R to find the values of a and b.\n\nFor point P = (1, 2):\n\n2^2 = 1^3 + a(1) + b (mod 7)\n4 = 1 + a + b (mod 7)\n\nFor point Q = (6, 3):\n\n3^2 = 6^3 + a(6) + b (mod 7)\n9 = 6^3 + 6a + b (mod 7)\n2 = 6a + b (mod 7)\n\nFor point R = (3, 6):\n\n6^2 = 3^3 + a(3) + b (mod 7)\n36 = 27 + 3a + b (mod 7)\n1 = 3a + b (mod 7)\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n\n1) a + b = 3 (mod 7)\n2) 6a + b = 2 (mod 7)\n3) 3a + b = 1 (mod 7)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2) and equation (3), we get:\n\n5a = 6 (mod 7)\n2a = 5 (mod 7)\n\nMultiplying equation (2) by 2, we get:\n\n4a = 10 (mod 7)\n4a = 3 (mod 7)\n\nSubtracting equation (3) from the new equation (2), we get:\n\na = 2 (mod 7)\n\nNow we can substitute a back into equation (1) to find b:\n\n2 + b = 3 (mod 7)\nb = 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo the equation of the elliptic curve is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1 (mod 7)"
