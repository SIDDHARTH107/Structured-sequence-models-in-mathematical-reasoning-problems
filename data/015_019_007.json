    "message_2": "To compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Henon-Heiles system, we need to numerically integrate the equations of motion and their variational equations. The variational equations are obtained by linearizing the system around a trajectory.\n\nLet's rewrite the system as a first-order differential equation:\n\nx' = u\nu' = -x - 2xy\ny' = v\nv' = -y - (x^2 - y^2)\n\nNow, let's linearize the system around a trajectory (x(t), y(t), u(t), v(t)):\n\nδx' = δu\nδu' = -δx - 2yδx - 2xδy\nδy' = δv\nδv' = -δy - 2xδx + 2yδy\n\nWe can now compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent by numerically integrating the original system and the variational system using initial conditions x(0) = 0.5, x'(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, and y'(0) = 0.1, and δx(0) = δy(0) = δu(0) = δv(0) = 0.\n\nAfter integrating the system for a sufficiently long time, the maximum Lyapunov exponent λ can be estimated as:\n\nλ = lim (t -> ∞) (1/t) * log(||δX(t)|| / ||δX(0)||)\n\nwhere δX(t) is the perturbation vector (δx(t), δy(t), δu(t), δv(t)) and ||.|| denotes the Euclidean norm.\n\nComputing the maximum Lyapunov exponent requires numerical methods, and the result will depend on the specific numerical method and parameters used. Therefore, I cannot provide an exact value for the maximum Lyapunov exponent. However, you can use numerical software like MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica to perform the integration and compute the exponent."
