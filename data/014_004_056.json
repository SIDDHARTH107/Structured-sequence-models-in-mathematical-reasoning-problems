    "message_2": "To find the public key in Elliptic Curve Cryptography, we need to perform scalar multiplication of the base point (G) with the private key (11 in this case). However, we also need to know the parameters of the elliptic curve equation (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b) to perform the point addition and doubling operations.\n\nPlease provide the elliptic curve equation parameters (a and b) and the prime field (p) if applicable, so that I can calculate the public key for you."
