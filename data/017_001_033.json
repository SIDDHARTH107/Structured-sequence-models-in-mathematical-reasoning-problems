    "message_2": "There are two groups of order 4: the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n\nTo prove that every group of order 4 is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, let G be a group of order 4. We will consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet a be an element of order 4 in G. Then, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element. This means that G is generated by a single element a, and thus G is a cyclic group of order 4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 4.\nIn this case, every non-identity element of G must have order 2. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Since both a and b have order 2, we have a^2 = e and b^2 = e. Now, consider the element ab. Since G has only 4 elements, ab must be either e, a, or b. If ab = e, then b = a^{-1}, which contradicts the fact that a and b are distinct non-identity elements. If ab = a, then b = e, which is also a contradiction. Similarly, if ab = b, then a = e, which is again a contradiction. Therefore, ab must be the fourth element in G, distinct from e, a, and b. Since (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ee = e, the element ab also has order 2. Thus, G = {e, a, b, ab}, where all non-identity elements have order 2. This is the definition of the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nNow, we will give an isomorphism between each of the groups of order 4 and either C4 or V4.\n\nFor a group G isomorphic to C4, let a be the generator of G. Define the isomorphism φ: G → C4 by φ(a^i) = i mod 4, where i = 0, 1, 2, 3. This is a well-defined isomorphism since φ is a bijection and preserves the group operation: φ(a^i * a^j) = φ(a^{i+j}) = (i + j) mod 4 = (i mod 4) + (j mod 4) = φ(a^i) + φ(a^j).\n\nFor a group G isomorphic to V4, let G = {e, a, b, ab}. Define the isomorphism ψ: G → V4 by ψ(e) = (0, 0), ψ(a) = (1, 0), ψ(b) = (0, 1), and ψ(ab) = (1, 1), where V4 is considered as the group of binary 2-tuples under component-wise addition modulo 2. This is a well-defined isomorphism since ψ is a bijection and preserves the group operation: ψ(a * b) = ψ(ab) = (1, 1) = (1, 0) + (0, 1) = ψ(a) + ψ(b)."
