    "message_2": "To find the wavelength and frequency of the wave, we need to analyze the wave equation given:\n\ny(x, t) = 0.1 sin(4πx - 10πt)\n\nThis equation is in the form:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, x is the position, ω is the angular frequency, and t is the time.\n\nFrom the given equation, we can identify the wave number (k) and the angular frequency (ω):\n\nk = 4π\nω = 10π\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) using the following relationships:\n\nk = 2π/λ\nω = 2πf\n\nFirst, let's find the wavelength (λ):\n\nk = 2π/λ\n4π = 2π/λ\nλ = 2π/4π\nλ = 1/2 meters\n\nNow, let's find the frequency (f):\n\nω = 2πf\n10π = 2πf\nf = 10π/2π\nf = 5 Hz\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is 1/2 meters, and the frequency is 5 Hz."
