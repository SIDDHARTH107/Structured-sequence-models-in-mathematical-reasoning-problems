Cyclic group C18: A group of order 18 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 18. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, PQ is a subgroup of G with order |P||Q| = 18. By the second isomorphism theorem, G/PQ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the direct product of G/P and G/Q. Since |G/P| = 2 and |G/Q| = 3, G/PQ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 3. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18 if and only if G/PQ is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n\n2. Non-abelian group of order 18: A group of order 18 is non-abelian if and only if it has a non-abelian Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup is 6, it is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C6 or the symmetric group S3. If the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to S3, then G is non-abelian. If the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to C6, then G is abelian and cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6: A group of order 18 is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 if and only if it has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. If both subgroups are normal, then their direct product is isomorphic to G, and G is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nIn summary, to determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we need to examine the properties of its Sylow subgroups. If G has an element of order 18, it is isomorphic to C18. If G has a non-abelian Sylow 2-subgroup, it is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18. If G has normal Sylow 3-subgroup and normal Sylow 2-subgroup, it is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6. Without more information about the group G, we cannot definitively determine which group it is isomorphic to."
