    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 9 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. The derivative of 3x^4 is (4)(3)x^(4-1) = 12x^3.\n2. The derivative of -2x^3 is (3)(-2)x^(3-1) = -6x^2.\n3. The derivative of 5x^2 is (2)(5)x^(2-1) = 10x.\n4. The derivative of -7x is -7 (since the derivative of x^1 is 1).\n5. The derivative of the constant term 9 is 0 (since the derivative of a constant is always 0).\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7"
