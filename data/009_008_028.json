    "message_1": "A string of length 10 meters is fixed at both ends and is initially at rest. At time t=0, the string is displaced from its equilibrium position by the function y(x) = 0.1 sin(πx/10). Find the wave equation that represents the motion of the string and determine the wave speed, wavelength, and period of the wave.",
    "message_2": "The given displacement function is y(x) = 0.1 sin(πx/10). Since the string is initially at rest, the wave equation representing the motion of the string can be written as:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt) + B sin(kx + ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are the amplitudes of the right-moving and left-moving waves, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nAt t = 0, the displacement function is y(x) = 0.1 sin(πx/10). Comparing this with the wave equation at t = 0, we get:\n\n0.1 sin(πx/10) = A sin(kx) + B sin(kx)\n\nSince the string is fixed at both ends, we know that y(0) = y(10) = 0. Therefore, the wave number k must be:\n\nk = nπ/L\n\nwhere n is an integer and L is the length of the string (10 meters). For the fundamental mode (n = 1), we have:\n\nk = π/10\n\nNow, we can rewrite the wave equation as:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(πx/10 - ωt) + B sin(πx/10 + ωt)\n\nSince the string is initially at rest, the initial velocity is zero. This means that A = B. So, the wave equation becomes:\n\ny(x, t) = A [sin(πx/10 - ωt) + sin(πx/10 + ωt)]\n\nTo find the wave speed, we need to know the relationship between the angular frequency ω and the wave number k. For a string, this relationship is given by:\n\nω = v * k\n\nwhere v is the wave speed. In this case, we don't have enough information to determine the wave speed, as it depends on the tension and linear mass density of the string.\n\nHowever, we can find the wavelength and period of the wave. The wavelength λ is related to the wave number k by:\n\nλ = 2π/k\n\nSubstituting k = π/10, we get:\n\nλ = 2π/(π/10) = 20 meters\n\nThe period T is related to the angular frequency ω by:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nSince we don't know the wave speed, we cannot determine the period of the wave.\n\nIn summary, the wave equation representing the motion of the string is:\n\ny(x, t) = A [sin(πx/10 - ωt) + sin(πx/10 + ωt)]\n\nThe wavelength of the wave is 20 meters, but we cannot determine the wave speed and period without more information about the string's properties."
