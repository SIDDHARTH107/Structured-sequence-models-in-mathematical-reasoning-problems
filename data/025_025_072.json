    "message_2": "To find the kernel of the map $\\phi: R \\rightarrow A$, we need to find all elements in R that are mapped to the identity element in A. In this case, the identity element in A is 0 (the additive identity).\n\nLet p(x) be an element in R, i.e., p(x) = c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + ... + c_nx^n, where c_i are complex coefficients. We want to find p(x) such that $\\phi(p(x)) = 0$ in A.\n\nApplying the map $\\phi$, we get:\n\n$\\phi(p(x)) = \\phi(c_0) + \\phi(c_1x) + \\phi(c_2x^2) + ... + \\phi(c_nx^n)$.\n\nSince $\\phi$ is a homomorphism, we have:\n\n$\\phi(p(x)) = c_0\\phi(1) + c_1\\phi(x) + c_2\\phi(x^2) + ... + c_n\\phi(x^n)$.\n\nNow, we know that $\\phi(x) = a$. We need to find $\\phi(x^k)$ for k > 1. Using the relation ab - ba = 1, we can rewrite it as ab = ba + 1. Multiplying both sides by a, we get:\n\na^2b = baa + a.\n\nNow, using the relation a^2b - b^2a = 0, we have:\n\nb^2a = a^2b.\n\nSubstituting the expression for a^2b, we get:\n\nb^2a = baa + a.\n\nThus, we have the relation:\n\nb^2a = baa + a.\n\nNow, let's find the expression for a^k for k > 1. We can use induction:\n\nBase case: k = 2, a^2 = ba + 1.\n\nInductive step: Assume a^k = baa^{k-1} + a^{k-1} for some k > 1.\n\nNow, we want to show that a^{k+1} = baa^k + a^k.\n\na^{k+1} = a(a^k) = a(baa^{k-1} + a^{k-1}) = abaa^{k-1} + aa^{k-1}.\n\nUsing the relation ab = ba + 1, we have:\n\nabaa^{k-1} = (ba + 1)aa^{k-1} = baaa^{k-1} + aa^{k-1} = baa^k + a^k.\n\nThus, by induction, we have:\n\na^k = baa^{k-1} + a^{k-1} for all k > 1.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression for $\\phi(p(x))$:\n\n$\\phi(p(x)) = c_0 + c_1a + c_2(ba + 1) + ... + c_n(baa^{n-1} + a^{n-1})$.\n\nWe want this expression to be equal to 0 in A. Notice that a and ba are linearly independent in A. Therefore, for the expression to be 0, we must have:\n\nc_0 = 0, and c_1 = -c_2 = c_3 = -c_4 = ... = (-1)^n c_n.\n\nThus, the kernel of $\\phi$ consists of all polynomials of the form:\n\np(x) = -x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2^2)(x^2 - 3^2)...(x^2 - n^2) for some non-negative integer n."
