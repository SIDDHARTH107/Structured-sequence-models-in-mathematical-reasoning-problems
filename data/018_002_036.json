A ∩ B is the set of elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 9}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nFor the element 3:\n3 ∈ A, since 3 is in the set A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3 ∈ B, since 3 is in the set B = {3, 6, 9}\n\nFor the element 9:\n9 ∈ A, since 9 is in the set A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n9 ∈ B, since 9 is in the set B = {3, 6, 9}\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A and also a subset of B."
