    "message_2": "To determine the number of boundary components of the 2-dimensional compact connected oriented manifold M, we will use the formula for the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ(M) = V - E + F\n\nwhere χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of M, V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nSince M is a 2-dimensional manifold, we can use the classification theorem for compact surfaces, which states that any compact connected oriented 2-dimensional manifold is homeomorphic to either a sphere, a connected sum of tori, or a connected sum of projective planes.\n\nGiven that the Euler characteristic of M is 4, we can rule out the connected sum of tori and connected sum of projective planes, as their Euler characteristics are non-positive. Therefore, M must be homeomorphic to a sphere.\n\nNow, let's consider the boundary components of M. If M has b boundary components, then we can think of M as a sphere with b \"holes\" or \"disks\" removed. In this case, the Euler characteristic of M can be computed as follows:\n\nχ(M) = χ(Sphere) - b * χ(Disk)\n\nSince the Euler characteristic of a sphere is 2 and the Euler characteristic of a disk is 1, we have:\n\n4 = 2 - b * 1\n\nSolving for b, we get:\n\nb = 2 - 4\nb = -2\n\nHowever, the number of boundary components cannot be negative. This contradiction implies that there is no 2-dimensional compact connected oriented manifold M with an Euler characteristic of 4."
