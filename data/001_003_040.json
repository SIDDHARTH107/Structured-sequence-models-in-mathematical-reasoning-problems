    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will make the coefficients of y's in both equations the same. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3. This will give us:\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nSecond equation * 3:\n12x - 6y = 30\n\nNow, we can add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) + (12x - 6y) = 14 + 30\n4x + 12x = 44\n16x = 44\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 44 / 16\nx = 11 / 4\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2(11/4) + 3y = 7\n11/2 + 3y = 7\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n3y = 7 - 11/2\n3y = (14 - 11)/2\n3y = 3/2\n\ny = (3/2) / 3\ny = 1/2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 11/4 and y = 1/2, or as an ordered pair (11/4, 1/2)."
