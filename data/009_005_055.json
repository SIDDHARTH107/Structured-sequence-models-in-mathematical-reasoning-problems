    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the following relationships:\n\n1. Ohm's Law: V = IR (where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance)\n2. Inductor voltage: VL = L * (dI/dt) (where VL is the voltage across the inductor, L is the inductance, and dI/dt is the derivative of current with respect to time)\n3. Capacitor voltage: VC = 1/C * integral(I dt) (where VC is the voltage across the capacitor, C is the capacitance, and integral(I dt) is the integral of current with respect to time)\n\nSince the resistor, inductor, and capacitor are in series, the voltage across each component must add up to the total voltage in the circuit. In this case, the total voltage is the voltage across the capacitor, which is given as 12 V at t = 0. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\nV = VR + VL + VC\n\nNow, we can substitute the relationships from Ohm's Law, inductor voltage, and capacitor voltage into this equation:\n\n12 = IR + L * (dI/dt) + 1/C * integral(I dt)\n\nGiven values: R = 10 Ω, L = 0.1 H, and C = 0.01 F. Plugging these values into the equation:\n\n12 = 10I + 0.1 * (dI/dt) + 1/0.01 * integral(I dt)\n\nNow, we have a first-order linear differential equation. To solve this equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫P(t) dt), where P(t) is the coefficient of I in the equation. In this case, P(t) = 10. So, the integrating factor is:\n\ne^(∫10 dt) = e^(10t)\n\nNow, multiply the entire equation by the integrating factor:\n\n12e^(10t) = 10Ie^(10t) + 0.1 * (dI/dt)e^(10t) + 100 * integral(I dt)e^(10t)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of I(t) and the integrating factor with respect to time:\n\nd(Ie^(10t))/dt = 12e^(10t)\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to time:\n\n∫d(Ie^(10t))/dt dt = ∫12e^(10t) dt\n\nIe^(10t) = (12/10)e^(10t) + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C. We know that the voltage across the capacitor is 12 V at t = 0. Therefore, we can plug in t = 0 and solve for C:\n\nIe^(0) = (12/10)e^(0) + C\n\nI = 1.2 + C\n\nSince the voltage across the capacitor is initially 12 V and there is no current flowing through the inductor at t = 0, the initial current through the resistor must be 0. Therefore, I = 0 at t = 0:\n\n0 = 1.2 + C\n\nC = -1.2\n\nNow, we can write the equation for I(t):\n\nI(t) = (12/10)e^(10t) - 1.2e^(10t)\n\nFinally, we can find the current at t = 2 seconds:\n\nI(2) = (12/10)e^(20) - 1.2e^(20)\n\nI(2) ≈ 0.000045 A\n\nSo, the current flowing through the circuit at t = 2 seconds is approximately 0.000045 A (45 µA)."
