    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9, we will first show that G must be abelian if it has no elements of order 3. Then, we will find the number of elements of order 3 in G if it is non-abelian.\n\n1. Suppose G has no elements of order 3.\n\nSince G has order 9, by the Sylow theorems, there must be a subgroup of order 3. Let H be a subgroup of G with order 3. Since G has no elements of order 3, the only possible orders for elements in G are 1 and 9. The identity element has order 1, and all other elements must have order 9. Thus, G is a cyclic group generated by any non-identity element, and G is isomorphic to C9.\n\n2. Suppose G is non-abelian.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then there must be at least one element of order 3. Let x be an element of order 3 in G, and let H = ⟨x⟩ be the subgroup generated by x. Then |H| = 3, and H is a normal subgroup of G since the index of H in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of |G|.\n\nNow consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 9 and |H| = 3, we have |G/H| = 9/3 = 3. Thus, G/H is a cyclic group of order 3, generated by some coset gH, where g is an element of G. Then, (gH)^3 = g^3H = H, which implies that g^3 is in H. Since H has only one non-identity element of order 3, we must have g^3 = x or g^3 = x^2.\n\nIf g^3 = x, then g has order 9 in G, which contradicts the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, g^3 = x^2. Now, let y = gx. Then, y^3 = (gx)^3 = g^3x^3 = x^2 * 1 = x^2. Thus, y is another element of order 3 in G.\n\nWe have found two distinct elements of order 3 in G, namely x and y. Since H has only two non-identity elements, these are all the elements of order 3 in G. Therefore, G has exactly 2 elements of order 3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is abelian, it is isomorphic to C9, and if G is non-abelian, it has exactly 2 elements of order 3."
