    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the equation:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in months.\n\nIn this case, K = 5000, P0 = 2000, r = 0.6, and t = 10.\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + (5000 - 2000) / 2000 * e^(-0.6*10))\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 3000 / 2000 * e^(-6))\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 1.5 * e^(-6))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-6) and then find the population after 10 months.\n\ne^(-6) ≈ 0.002478752\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 1.5 * 0.002478752)\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 0.003718128)\n\nP(10) = 5000 / 1.003718128\n\nP(10) ≈ 4982.56\n\nAfter 10 months, the population of rabbits is approximately 4982.56. Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, we can round this number to the nearest whole number, which is 4983 rabbits."
