    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves, we first need to find the points of intersection. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx² = 2x - 4\n\nRearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx² - 2x + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the x values where the two curves intersect:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)² - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 16)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (4 - 16) is negative, the equation has no real roots. This means that the two curves do not intersect, and there is no area between them."
