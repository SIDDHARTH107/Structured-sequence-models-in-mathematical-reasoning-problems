    "message_2": "There are three non-isomorphic groups of order 18:\n\n1. The cyclic group C18 (generated by an element of order 18)\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups, C9 x C2 (generated by an element of order 9 and an element of order 2)\n3. The semidirect product of C9 and C2, which is a non-abelian group.\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic because they have different properties, such as being abelian or non-abelian, and having different element orders."
