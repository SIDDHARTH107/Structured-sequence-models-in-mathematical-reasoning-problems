    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a closed orientable surface can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere g is the genus of the surface.\n\nGiven that the surface has genus 4, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(4) = 2 - 8 = -6\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the closed orientable surface with genus 4 is -6."
