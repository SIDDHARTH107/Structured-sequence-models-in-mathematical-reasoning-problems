Mean of the monthly sales.\n2. Median of the monthly sales.\n3. Mode of the monthly sales.\n4. Variance of the monthly sales.\n5. Standard deviation of the monthly sales.\n\nSolve the above problems and interpret the results.",
    "message_2": "1. Mean of the monthly sales:\nTo find the mean, we sum up all the sales and divide by the number of months (12).\n\nMean = (30 + 35 + 45 + 50 + 60 + 55 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90) / 12\nMean = 740 / 12\nMean ≈ 61.67 (in thousands)\n\nThe mean monthly sales for the company is approximately 61.67 thousand dollars.\n\n2. Median of the monthly sales:\nTo find the median, we first arrange the sales data in ascending order and then find the middle value. Since we have an even number of months, we will take the average of the two middle values.\n\nSorted Sales: 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90\nMedian = (55 + 60) / 2\nMedian = 115 / 2\nMedian = 57.5 (in thousands)\n\nThe median monthly sales for the company is 57.5 thousand dollars.\n\n3. Mode of the monthly sales:\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. In this case, all values are unique, so there is no mode.\n\n4. Variance of the monthly sales:\nTo find the variance, we first find the mean (which we already calculated), then subtract the mean from each value, square the result, and find the average of those squared differences.\n\nMean = 61.67\nSquared differences: (30-61.67)^2, (35-61.67)^2, ..., (90-61.67)^2\nSum of squared differences = 1015.56 + 712.89 + 277.56 + 136.89 + 43.56 + 44.89 + 11.56 + 69.56 + 177.89 + 336.89 + 547.56 + 806.89\nSum of squared differences = 3369\nVariance = Sum of squared differences / (Number of months - 1)\nVariance = 3369 / 11\nVariance ≈ 306.27\n\nThe variance of the monthly sales is approximately 306.27 (in thousands squared).\n\n5. Standard deviation of the monthly sales:\nTo find the standard deviation, we take the square root of the variance.\n\nStandard deviation = √Variance\nStandard deviation = √306.27\nStandard deviation ≈ 17.5 (in thousands)\n\nThe standard deviation of the monthly sales is approximately 17.5 thousand dollars.\n\nInterpretation of the results:\nThe mean and median monthly sales are close, indicating that the sales data is not heavily skewed. The lack of a mode suggests that there is no specific sales value that occurs more frequently than others. The variance and standard deviation provide a measure of the spread of the sales data, with the standard deviation being more interpretable as it is in the same unit (thousands) as the sales data. A standard deviation of 17.5 thousand dollars indicates that the sales data has a moderate spread around the mean."
