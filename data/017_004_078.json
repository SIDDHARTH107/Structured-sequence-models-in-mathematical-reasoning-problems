    "message_2": "There are 14 possible groups of order 16. We can classify them into the following types:\n\n1. Cyclic group: There is one cyclic group of order 16, denoted by C_16. It is generated by an element of order 16.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2: There are 4 groups of this type. They are isomorphic to C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2, C_4 x C_2 x C_2, C_8 x C_2, and C_4 x C_4.\n\nTo show that these groups are either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. The theorem states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nSince 16 = 2^4, any group of order 16 is a direct product of cyclic groups of order 2^k for some k. The possible values of k are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The groups corresponding to these values are:\n\n1. C_16 (cyclic group of order 16)\n2. C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2, C_4 x C_2 x C_2, C_8 x C_2, and C_4 x C_4 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2)\n\nThus, all groups of order 16 are either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2."
