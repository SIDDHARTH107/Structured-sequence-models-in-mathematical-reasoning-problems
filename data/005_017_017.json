The data is as follows: \n\nLevel 1:  $40,000\nLevel 2:  $50,000\nLevel 3:  $60,000\nLevel 4:  $70,000\nLevel 5:  $80,000\nLevel 6:  $90,000\n\nUsing Principal Component Analysis, calculate the first principal component of the dataset.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the first principal component using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data.\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix.\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n4. Choose the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue as the first principal component.\n\nHowever, in this case, the dataset is one-dimensional (salaries), so PCA is not applicable. PCA is used for reducing the dimensionality of multi-dimensional datasets while preserving as much information as possible. Since we only have one dimension (salaries), there is no need to perform PCA."
