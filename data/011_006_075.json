    "message_1": "Suppose you have a standard deck of 52 cards, how many ways are there to choose 5 cards such that at least 2 of the cards are hearts?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We will first find the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from the deck and then subtract the number of ways to choose 5 cards with no hearts and the number of ways to choose 5 cards with exactly one heart.\n\n1. Total number of ways to choose 5 cards from the deck:\nThere are 52 cards in the deck, so the total number of ways to choose 5 cards is C(52, 5) = 52! / (5! * (52-5)!) = 2,598,960.\n\n2. Number of ways to choose 5 cards with no hearts:\nThere are 39 cards that are not hearts (13 cards of each of the other three suits). The number of ways to choose 5 cards with no hearts is C(39, 5) = 39! / (5! * (39-5)!) = 575,757.\n\n3. Number of ways to choose 5 cards with exactly one heart:\nThere are 13 hearts in the deck. We can choose 1 heart in C(13, 1) = 13 ways. Then, we need to choose 4 cards from the remaining 39 non-heart cards. This can be done in C(39, 4) = 39! / (4! * (39-4)!) = 822,51 ways. So, the total number of ways to choose 5 cards with exactly one heart is 13 * 822,51 = 10,694,664.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of ways to choose 5 cards such that at least 2 of the cards are hearts:\n\nTotal ways - (ways with no hearts + ways with exactly one heart) = 2,598,960 - (575,757 + 10,694,664) = 2,598,960 - 11,270,421 = -671,461.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our calculation of the number of ways to choose 5 cards with exactly one heart. The correct calculation should be:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 5 cards with exactly one heart = 13 * C(39, 4) = 13 * 91,390 = 1,188,070.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion again:\n\nTotal ways - (ways with no hearts + ways with exactly one heart) = 2,598,960 - (575,757 + 1,188,070) = 2,598,960 - 1,763,827 = 835,133.\n\nSo, there are 835,133 ways to choose 5 cards such that at least 2 of the cards are hearts."
