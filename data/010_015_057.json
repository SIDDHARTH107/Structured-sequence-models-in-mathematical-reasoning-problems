    "message_2": "The De Rham cohomology groups are topological invariants that can be computed using differential forms on a smooth manifold. In this case, X is a sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, which is a smooth manifold.\n\nFor a sphere, the De Rham cohomology groups are given by:\n\nH^0(X) = R (the constant functions)\nH^1(X) = 0 (since the sphere is simply connected)\nH^2(X) = R (since the sphere has a non-vanishing 2-form, the volume form)\nH^k(X) = 0 for k > 2 (since the sphere is a 2-dimensional manifold)\n\nSo, the second De Rham cohomology group of X, H^2(X), is isomorphic to the real numbers R."
