    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal does not change with the number of iterations. The Vicsek fractal, also known as the Vicsek snowflake, is a self-similar fractal. Its Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (N = 5), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 3 (s = 3). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.46497, regardless of the number of iterations."
