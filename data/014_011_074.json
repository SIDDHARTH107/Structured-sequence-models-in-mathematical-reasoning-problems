    "message_1": "A plaintext message contains 72 characters. If a transposition cipher is used with a key length of 9, how many rows and columns will the ciphertext matrix have?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher with a key length of 9 means that the plaintext message will be divided into columns of 9 characters each. To find the number of rows, we can divide the total number of characters (72) by the number of columns (9).\n\n72 characters / 9 columns = 8 rows\n\nSo, the ciphertext matrix will have 8 rows and 9 columns."
