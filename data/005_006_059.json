    "message_2": "To find the probability that the sample mean will be between 48 and 52, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 50, the population standard deviation (σ) is 10, and the sample size (n) is 100. \n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample means, which is:\n\nσ_sample = σ / √n = 10 / √100 = 10 / 10 = 1\n\nNow, we have a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 1. We want to find the probability that the sample mean is between 48 and 52. To do this, we can use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ_sample\n\nFor the lower bound (48):\n\nz_lower = (48 - 50) / 1 = -2\n\nFor the upper bound (52):\n\nz_upper = (52 - 50) / 1 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is between -2 and 2. We can use a standard normal distribution table (z-table) to find the probabilities:\n\nP(z ≤ 2) = 0.9772\nP(z ≤ -2) = 0.0228\n\nTo find the probability that the z-score is between -2 and 2, we can subtract the probabilities:\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = P(z ≤ 2) - P(z ≤ -2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean will be between 48 and 52 is approximately 0.9544 or 95.44%."
