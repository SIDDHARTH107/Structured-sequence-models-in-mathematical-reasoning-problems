The smallest perfect number is 6, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, and 3.\n\nBetween 1 and 10,000, there are four perfect numbers:\n\n1. 6 (1 + 2 + 3)\n2. 28 (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14)\n3. 496 (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248)\n4. 8128 (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 127 + 254 + 508 + 1016 + 2032 + 4064)\n\nSo, there are 4 perfect numbers between 1 and 10,000."
