    "message_1": "One example of a precise numerical problem related to Non-monotonic logic in mathematics is:\n\nAlice gives Bob two hints about her favorite number, but does not reveal the number itself. Hint 1: \"My favorite number is not divisible by 2 or 3.\" Hint 2: \"If you add 10 to my favorite number, the result is also not divisible by 2 or 3.\" \n\nIf Bob knows that Alice is using non-monotonic logic to give these hints, what is the smallest possible set of numbers that Alice's favorite number can be in?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the hints given by Alice and the fact that she is using non-monotonic logic.\n\nHint 1: \"My favorite number is not divisible by 2 or 3.\"\nThis means that Alice's favorite number is not even and not a multiple of 3. Let's call her favorite number N.\n\nHint 2: \"If you add 10 to my favorite number, the result is also not divisible by 2 or 3.\"\nThis means that (N + 10) is also not even and not a multiple of 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of N based on these hints and non-monotonic logic.\n\nIf N is odd and not divisible by 3, then N can be in the form of 6k + 1 or 6k + 5, where k is an integer. This is because any number not divisible by 2 or 3 will be in one of these forms.\n\nNow, we need to check if (N + 10) is also not divisible by 2 or 3.\n\nFor N = 6k + 1, (N + 10) = 6k + 11, which is not divisible by 2 but is divisible by 3 when k is even. So, this form does not satisfy the second hint.\n\nFor N = 6k + 5, (N + 10) = 6k + 15, which is not divisible by 2 and is divisible by 3 only when k is even. However, since Alice is using non-monotonic logic, we cannot eliminate this possibility.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible set of numbers that Alice's favorite number can be in is {5, 11, 17, 23, ...}, which are in the form of 6k + 5, where k is an integer."
