    "message_2": "To determine the number of iterations needed for z0 to escape the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, we will apply the recursive formula z(k+1) = z(k)^2 + c, where z0 = 0 and c = 1 + 1i.\n\nIteration 1:\nz(1) = z(0)^2 + c = 0^2 + (1 + 1i) = 1 + 1i\n\nIteration 2:\nz(2) = z(1)^2 + c = (1 + 1i)^2 + (1 + 1i) = (1^2 - 1^2) + 2(1)(1)i + (1 + 1i) = 2i + (1 + 1i) = 1 + 3i\n\nIteration 3:\nz(3) = z(2)^2 + c = (1 + 3i)^2 + (1 + 1i) = (1^2 - 3^2) + 2(1)(3)i + (1 + 1i) = -8 + 6i + (1 + 1i) = -7 + 7i\n\nNow, we need to check if z(3) is outside the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. We can do this by calculating the magnitude of z(3):\n\n|z(3)| = √((-7)^2 + (7)^2) = √(49 + 49) = √98\n\nSince |z(3)| > 2, z0 escapes the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin after 3 iterations.\n\nNow, to classify c as a member or not a member of the Mandelbrot set, we need to check if the sequence of z(k) remains bounded. In this case, since z0 escaped the circle of radius 2 after 3 iterations, the sequence is not bounded. Therefore, c = 1 + 1i is not a member of the Mandelbrot set."
