A sample of 36 bottles is taken, and the average amount of juice in the sample is found to be 495mL. Find the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of juice per bottle.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of juice per bottle, we will use the formula for the confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval. Since we want the middle 95% of the distribution, we will have 2.5% in each tail. To find the Z-score, we can look it up in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator. The Z-score for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 495 ± (1.96 * (20 / √36))\n\nCI = 495 ± (1.96 * (20 / 6))\n\nCI = 495 ± (1.96 * 3.33)\n\nCI = 495 ± 6.53\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of juice per bottle is approximately (488.47 mL, 501.53 mL)."
