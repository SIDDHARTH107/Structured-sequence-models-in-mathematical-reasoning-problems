    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = sin(x), and the interval is [0, 2π]. So, a = 0 and b = 2π.\n\nAverage value = (1/(2π-0)) * ∫[0, 2π] sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to 2π:\n\n∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\n[-cos(2π) + cos(0)] = [-cos(2π) + 1] = [1 - 1] = 0\n\nSo, the integral of sin(x) from 0 to 2π is 0.\n\nNow, we'll plug this back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(2π-0)) * 0 = 0\n\nTherefore, the average value of f(x) = sin(x) on the interval [0, 2π] is 0."
