    "message_2": "To solve this problem using complex analysis techniques, we will first rewrite the Fourier transform formula as follows:\n\nF[f(z)](x) = (1/√(2π)) ∫ [f(z) e^(-ixz)] dz from -∞ to +∞\n           = (1/√(2π)) ∫ [(1 + iz)/(1 + z^2) e^(-ixz)] dz from -∞ to +∞\n\nNow, we will use the method of contour integration to evaluate this integral. We will consider the contour integral over a semicircular contour in the upper half-plane. Let C_R be the contour consisting of the line segment from -R to R on the real axis and the semicircle with radius R centered at the origin in the upper half-plane.\n\nLet's first find the poles of the function f(z) = (1 + iz)/(1 + z^2). The poles are the solutions of the equation 1 + z^2 = 0. This equation has two solutions: z = i and z = -i. Only the pole z = i lies inside the contour C_R.\n\nNow, we will use the residue theorem to evaluate the contour integral:\n\n∫_C_R [(1 + iz)/(1 + z^2) e^(-ixz)] dz = 2πi * Residue of [(1 + iz)/(1 + z^2) e^(-ixz)] at z = i\n\nTo find the residue, we will use the formula:\n\nResidue = lim_(z -> i) [(z - i)(1 + iz)/(1 + z^2) e^(-ixz)]\n\nNow, let's compute the residue:\n\nResidue = lim_(z -> i) [(1 + iz)/(1 + z^2) e^(-ixz) * (z - i)]\n        = lim_(z -> i) [(1 + iz)/(z + i) e^(-ixz)]\n        = (1 + i^2)/(2i) e^(-ix*i)\n        = (-1)/(2i) e^(-x)\n        = (1/2) e^(-x)\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the contour integral:\n\n∫_C_R [(1 + iz)/(1 + z^2) e^(-ixz)] dz = 2πi * (1/2) e^(-x)\n                                       = πi e^(-x)\n\nAs R goes to infinity, the integral over the semicircular part of the contour goes to zero. Therefore, the integral over the real axis is equal to the contour integral:\n\n∫ [f(z) e^(-ixz)] dz from -∞ to +∞ = πi e^(-x)\n\nFinally, we can find the Fourier transform of f(z):\n\nF[f(z)](x) = (1/√(2π)) * πi e^(-x)\n           = (i/√(2π)) * π e^(-x)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(z) = (1 + iz)/(1 + z^2) is F[f(z)](x) = (i/√(2π)) * π e^(-x)."
