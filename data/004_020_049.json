    "message_2": "To find the work done in lifting the crate, we need to consider the work done by the force acting on the crate and the work done by the force acting on the rope. \n\nFirst, let's find the work done by the force acting on the crate. The force acting on the crate is equal to its weight, which is 100 pounds. The crate is lifted vertically 10 feet, so the work done by the force acting on the crate is:\n\nW_crate = F_crate * distance\nW_crate = 100 pounds * 10 feet\nW_crate = 1000 foot-pounds\n\nNow, let's find the work done by the force acting on the rope. The rope weighs 2 pounds per foot, and it is being lifted 10 feet. The weight of the rope changes as it is lifted since the length of the rope being lifted decreases. To find the work done by the force acting on the rope, we can use integration:\n\nW_rope = âˆ«(2x)dx from 0 to 10, where x is the length of the rope being lifted.\n\nW_rope = [x^2] from 0 to 10\nW_rope = (10^2) - (0^2)\nW_rope = 100 foot-pounds\n\nNow, we can find the total work done by adding the work done by the force acting on the crate and the work done by the force acting on the rope:\n\nW_total = W_crate + W_rope\nW_total = 1000 foot-pounds + 100 foot-pounds\nW_total = 1100 foot-pounds\n\nSo, the total work done in lifting the crate is 1100 foot-pounds."
