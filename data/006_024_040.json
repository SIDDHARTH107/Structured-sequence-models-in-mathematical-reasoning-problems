    "message_1": "A couple is planning a road trip across the country, and they have marked 10 potential destinations along the way. The probability of making it to their first destination is 0.8, second destination is 0.7, third destination is 0.6, and so on, with the probability decreasing by 0.1 at each subsequent destination. What is the probability of them making it to their final destination, which is the 10th location on their list?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of making it to the final destination, we need to multiply the probabilities of making it to each destination along the way. Since the probability decreases by 0.1 at each subsequent destination, we can write the probabilities as follows:\n\n1st destination: 0.8\n2nd destination: 0.7\n3rd destination: 0.6\n4th destination: 0.5\n5th destination: 0.4\n6th destination: 0.3\n7th destination: 0.2\n8th destination: 0.1\n9th destination: 0.0 (since the probability cannot be negative)\n10th destination: 0.0 (since the probability cannot be negative)\n\nSince the probability of making it to the 9th and 10th destinations is 0, the couple cannot make it to the final destination. Therefore, the probability of them making it to the 10th destination is 0."
