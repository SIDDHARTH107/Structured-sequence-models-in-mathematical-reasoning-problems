To do this, we need to show that A x B ≠ B x A.\n\nAs we found earlier:\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nB x A = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nWe can see that A x B and B x A are not equal, as their ordered pairs are different. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
