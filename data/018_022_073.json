The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of A and B, A ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we find the elements in either A or B, but not in their intersection:\n\nA △ B = (A - (A ∩ B)) ∪ (B - (A ∩ B))\nA △ B = ({1, 2, 3} - {2, 3}) ∪ ({2, 3, 4} - {2, 3})\nA △ B = {1} ∪ {4}\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow that we have the symmetric difference, we can find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and C:\n\n(A △ B) x C = {1, 4} x {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nTo find the Cartesian product, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from (A △ B) and the second element from C:\n\n(A △ B) x C = {(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product (A △ B) x C is:\n\n{(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}"
