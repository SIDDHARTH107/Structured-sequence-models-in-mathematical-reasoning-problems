    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 2 raised to the power of 17 is divided by 5, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We want to find the value of (2^17) mod 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the remainders of the powers of 2 when divided by 5:\n\n2^1 mod 5 = 2\n2^2 mod 5 = 4\n2^3 mod 5 = 3\n2^4 mod 5 = 1\n2^5 mod 5 = 2\n2^6 mod 5 = 4\n...\n\nWe can see that the remainders repeat in a cycle of length 4: 2, 4, 3, 1. To find the remainder of 2^17 mod 5, we can find the remainder of 17 when divided by the length of the cycle:\n\n17 mod 4 = 1\n\nThis means that the remainder of 2^17 mod 5 is the same as the remainder of 2^1 mod 5, which is 2. Therefore, the remainder when 2 raised to the power of 17 is divided by 5 is 2."
