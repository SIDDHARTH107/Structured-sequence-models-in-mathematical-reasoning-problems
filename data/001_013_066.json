    "message_2": "To solve for the value of x, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(2x + 7))^2 = 5^2\n\nNow, we simplify:\n\n2x + 7 = 25\n\nNext, we isolate x by subtracting 7 from both sides:\n\n2x = 18\n\nFinally, we divide by 2 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 9"
