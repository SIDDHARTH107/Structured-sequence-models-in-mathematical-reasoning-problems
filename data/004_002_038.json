    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 1) / (2x^2 - 5x + 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to plug in the value of x = 2 directly into the function:\n\nf(2) = (3(2)^2 - 1) / (2(2)^2 - 5(2) + 2)\n\nf(2) = (3(4) - 1) / (2(4) - 10 + 2)\n\nf(2) = (12 - 1) / (8 - 10 + 2)\n\nf(2) = 11 / 0\n\nSince we have a division by zero, we cannot directly plug in the value of x = 2. Instead, we can try to simplify the function and see if we can cancel out any terms.\n\nf(x) = (3x^2 - 1) / (2x^2 - 5x + 2)\n\nWe can try to factor both the numerator and the denominator:\n\nNumerator: 3x^2 - 1 is a difference of squares, so it can be factored as (sqrt(3x^2) + 1)(sqrt(3x^2) - 1) = (sqrt(3)x + 1)(sqrt(3)x - 1)\n\nDenominator: 2x^2 - 5x + 2 can be factored as (2x - 1)(x - 2)\n\nSo, f(x) = ((sqrt(3)x + 1)(sqrt(3)x - 1)) / ((2x - 1)(x - 2))\n\nNow we can see that there are no common factors in the numerator and the denominator that can be canceled out. Since we still have a division by zero when x = 2, the limit does not exist."
