    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x in the equation. Here's the equation:\n\n√(3x + 4) + 2 = 8\n\nFirst, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n√(3x + 4) = 6\n\nNow, square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n(√(3x + 4))^2 = 6^2\n\n3x + 4 = 36\n\nNext, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3x = 32\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 32/3\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\nx = 32/3"
