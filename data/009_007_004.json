    "message_1": "A fluid flows through a channel with a width of 2 meters and a height of 1.5 meters. The velocity distribution in the channel is given by the following equation: \n\nu(y) = 0.5*(1-(y/1.5)^2) \n\nwhere u is the velocity in meters per second and y is the distance from the bottom of the channel in meters. Determine the average velocity and mass flow rate of the fluid.",
    "message_2": "To find the average velocity, we need to integrate the velocity distribution function u(y) over the height of the channel and then divide by the height. The average velocity (U_avg) can be calculated as follows:\n\nU_avg = (1/height) * ∫[u(y) dy] from 0 to height\n\nLet's calculate the integral first:\n\n∫[u(y) dy] = ∫[0.5*(1-(y/1.5)^2) dy] from 0 to 1.5\n\nLet's substitute z = y/1.5, so y = 1.5z and dy = 1.5dz:\n\n∫[0.5*(1-(y/1.5)^2) dy] = 1.5 * ∫[0.5*(1-z^2) dz] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, integrate with respect to z:\n\n1.5 * [0.5*(z - z^3/3)] from 0 to 1 = 1.5 * [0.5*(1 - 1/3)] = 1.5 * 0.5 * (2/3) = 0.5\n\nSo, the average velocity U_avg is 0.5 m/s.\n\nNow, let's calculate the mass flow rate. The mass flow rate (Q) is the product of the average velocity, the cross-sectional area of the channel, and the fluid density (ρ):\n\nQ = ρ * U_avg * Area\n\nWe don't have the fluid density (ρ) given in the problem, so we can only express the mass flow rate in terms of ρ:\n\nQ = ρ * 0.5 * (width * height)\n\nQ = ρ * 0.5 * (2 * 1.5)\n\nQ = 1.5ρ kg/s\n\nSo, the mass flow rate of the fluid is 1.5ρ kg/s, where ρ is the fluid density in kg/m³."
