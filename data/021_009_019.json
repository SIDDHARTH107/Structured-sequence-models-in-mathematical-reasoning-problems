    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient at any point x.\n\nf(x) = x^2 + 6x + 5\nf'(x) = 2x + 6\n\nNow, we will apply the gradient descent method with the given learning rate (α = 0.1) and initial guess (x0 = 3) for 5 iterations.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - α * f'(x0)\nx1 = 3 - 0.1 * (2*3 + 6)\nx1 = 3 - 0.1 * 12\nx1 = 3 - 1.2\nx1 = 1.8\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - α * f'(x1)\nx2 = 1.8 - 0.1 * (2*1.8 + 6)\nx2 = 1.8 - 0.1 * 9.6\nx2 = 1.8 - 0.96\nx2 = 0.84\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - α * f'(x2)\nx3 = 0.84 - 0.1 * (2*0.84 + 6)\nx3 = 0.84 - 0.1 * 7.68\nx3 = 0.84 - 0.768\nx3 = 0.072\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = x3 - α * f'(x3)\nx4 = 0.072 - 0.1 * (2*0.072 + 6)\nx4 = 0.072 - 0.1 * 6.144\nx4 = 0.072 - 0.6144\nx4 = -0.5424\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = x4 - α * f'(x4)\nx5 = -0.5424 - 0.1 * (2*(-0.5424) + 6)\nx5 = -0.5424 - 0.1 * 4.9152\nx5 = -0.5424 - 0.49152\nx5 = -1.03392\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the value of x5 is approximately -1.03392."
