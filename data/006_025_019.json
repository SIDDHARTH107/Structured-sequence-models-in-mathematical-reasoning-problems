    "message_1": "In a magic show, a magician has to randomly select five cards from a deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that exactly three Aces will be chosen in the five cards?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of the items does not matter.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 52 (total number of cards) and k = 5 (number of cards to choose). So, the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards is:\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5!(52-5)!) = 2,598,960\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose exactly three Aces from the four available Aces and two other cards from the remaining 48 cards (52 cards - 4 Aces).\n\nThe number of ways to choose three Aces from four is:\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4\n\nThe number of ways to choose two other cards from the remaining 48 cards is:\n\nC(48, 2) = 48! / (2!(48-2)!) = 1,128\n\nNow, we need to multiply these two results to find the total number of ways to choose exactly three Aces and two other cards:\n\n4 * 1,128 = 4,512\n\nFinally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of ways to choose exactly three Aces and two other cards by the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards:\n\nProbability = 4,512 / 2,598,960 â‰ˆ 0.001736\n\nSo, the probability of choosing exactly three Aces in the five cards is approximately 0.1736% or 0.001736 as a decimal."
