    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $2, and the profit from each unit of product B is $3. The factory has 600 units of raw material, 400 hours of labor per day, and can produce a maximum of 300 units of product A per day and a maximum of 200 units of product B per day. What is the optimal number of units of product A and B that the factory should produce per day to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: x + y ≤ 600\n2. Labor constraint: x + 2y ≤ 400\n3. Production capacity constraint for product A: x ≤ 300\n4. Production capacity constraint for product B: y ≤ 200\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 2x + 3y\n\nTo find the optimal number of units of product A and B, we will solve this linear programming problem graphically by plotting the feasible region and finding the vertices.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints as equalities to plot the lines:\n\n1. x + y = 600\n2. x + 2y = 400\n3. x = 300\n4. y = 200\n\nNext, we'll find the intersection points of these lines:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and 2: (200, 400)\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and 3: (300, 300)\n3. Intersection of constraint 1 and 4: (400, 200)\n4. Intersection of constraint 2 and 3: (300, 50)\n5. Intersection of constraint 2 and 4: (0, 200)\n6. Intersection of constraint 3 and 4: (300, 200)\n\nNow, we'll check which of these intersection points are within the feasible region:\n\n1. (200, 400) is not feasible because it violates constraint 2.\n2. (300, 300) is not feasible because it violates constraint 1 and 2.\n3. (400, 200) is not feasible because it violates constraint 1.\n4. (300, 50) is feasible.\n5. (0, 200) is feasible.\n6. (300, 200) is feasible.\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at these feasible points:\n\n1. P(300, 50) = 2(300) + 3(50) = 600 + 150 = 750\n2. P(0, 200) = 2(0) + 3(200) = 0 + 600 = 600\n3. P(300, 200) = 2(300) + 3(200) = 600 + 600 = 1200\n\nThe maximum profit is $1200, which occurs when the factory produces 300 units of product A and 200 units of product B per day."
