    "message_1": "Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob. She uses a stream cipher to encrypt the message. The key stream is generated by a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with the polynomial x^4 + x^2 + 1. The initial state of the LFSR is 1100. \n\nWhat is the key stream if Alice wants to encrypt the message \"HELLO\"?",
    "message_2": "To find the key stream for the message \"HELLO\", we first need to determine the length of the message in bits. Since each character in the message is represented by 8 bits (1 byte) in ASCII, the length of the message \"HELLO\" is 5 characters * 8 bits/character = 40 bits.\n\nNow, we need to generate a 40-bit key stream using the LFSR with the polynomial x^4 + x^2 + 1 and the initial state 1100. The LFSR generates the key stream by shifting the register and calculating the new bit based on the feedback polynomial.\n\nThe LFSR operation can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Initial state: 1100\n2. Shift the register to the left and calculate the new bit using the polynomial x^4 + x^2 + 1: (1 * 1) + (1 * 0) = 1\n3. New state: 1001\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the desired key stream length is reached.\n\nFollowing this procedure, we can generate the 40-bit key stream:\n\n1. 1100\n2. 1001\n3. 0011\n4. 0110\n5. 1101\n6. 1011\n7. 0111\n8. 1110\n9. 1100 (repeats the initial state)\n\nSince the LFSR repeats its state after 8 steps, the key stream will also repeat after 8 bits. Therefore, the 40-bit key stream for the message \"HELLO\" is:\n\n1100100110111101110010011011110111001001"
