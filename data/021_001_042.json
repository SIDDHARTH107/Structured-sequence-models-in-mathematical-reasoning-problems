    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n```\n| 2  3  5 |  23 |\n| 1 -2  3 |  -8 |\n| 3  4 -1 |  14 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner:\n\n```\n| 1 -2  3 |  -8 |\n| 2  3  5 |  23 |\n| 3  4 -1 |  14 |\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column below the 1:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1:\n\n```\n| 1 -2  3 |  -8 |\n| 0  7 -1 |  39 |\n| 3  4 -1 |  14 |\n```\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1:\n\n```\n| 1 -2  3 |  -8 |\n| 0  7 -1 |  39 |\n| 0 10 -10|  38 |\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 7 to get a 1 in the second row and second column:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 / 7:\n\n```\n| 1 -2  3 |  -8 |\n| 0  1 -1/7| 39/7|\n| 0 10 -10|  38 |\n```\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 10 in the third row and second column:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 10 * Row 2:\n\n```\n| 1 -2  3 |  -8  |\n| 0  1 -1/7| 39/7 |\n| 0  0 -60/7| -10 |\n```\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by -60/7 to get a 1 in the third row and third column:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 / (-60/7):\n\n```\n| 1 -2  3 |  -8  |\n| 0  1 -1/7| 39/7 |\n| 0  0  1  |  7/6 |\n```\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form, and we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = 7/6\n\ny = 39/7 + 1/7 * z = 39/7 + 1/7 * (7/6) = 6\n\nx = -8 + 2 * y - 3 * z = -8 + 2 * 6 - 3 * (7/6) = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 6, and z = 7/6."
