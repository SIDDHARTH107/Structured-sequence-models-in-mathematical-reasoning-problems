    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail Fence Cipher with a key of height 3, we need to rearrange the ciphertext \"MTAIMHESINFUCTESIS\" back into the original plaintext message.\n\nFirst, let's determine the length of each row. The plaintext has 16 characters, so we can divide it into 3 rows with lengths 6, 4, and 6.\n\nRow 1: MTA_IM_\nRow 2: _HES_NF\nRow 3: _UC_TE_IS\n\nNow, we can fill in the missing characters from the ciphertext:\n\nRow 1: MTAIHM\nRow 2: HESINF\nRow 3: UCTESIS\n\nFinally, we read the rows in a zigzag pattern to obtain the original plaintext message:\n\nM A T H E M A T I C S I S F U N\n\nSo, the original plaintext message is \"MATHEMATICSISFUN\"."
