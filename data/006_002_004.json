    "message_2": "A standard six-sided dice has six faces, each with a different number from 1 to 6. There is only one face with the number 2. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2 on a standard six-sided dice is 1 out of 6, or 1/6, which can also be expressed as approximately 0.1667 or 16.67%."
