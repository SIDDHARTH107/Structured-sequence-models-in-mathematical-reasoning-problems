    "message_1": "A population of rabbits is known to grow continuously at a rate of 5.5% per year. If there are initially 200 rabbits, find the size of the rabbit population after 5 years. Assume that there is no predation or other limiting factors affecting the population growth. Use the exponential growth model to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the exponential growth model formula:\n\nP(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t\n\nwhere:\nP(t) = the population size after t years\nP0 = the initial population size (200 rabbits)\nr = the growth rate (5.5% per year, or 0.055 as a decimal)\nt = the number of years (5 years)\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(5) = 200 * (1 + 0.055)^5\n\nP(5) = 200 * (1.055)^5\n\nP(5) ≈ 200 * 1.297\n\nP(5) ≈ 259.4\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a rabbit, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the rabbit population after 5 years will be approximately 260 rabbits."
