    "message_1": "A signal is given by the following equation:\n\nf(t) = 2sin(4πt) + 3cos(6πt)\n\nDetermine the Fourier transform of the signal and identify the frequencies and amplitudes of the two components.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal, we can use the following formula:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1), ω is the angular frequency, and the integral is taken over all time.\n\nHowever, since the given signal is already composed of sinusoidal functions, we can directly identify the frequencies and amplitudes of the two components without calculating the Fourier transform.\n\nThe given signal is:\n\nf(t) = 2sin(4πt) + 3cos(6πt)\n\nThe first component is a sine function with amplitude A1 = 2 and angular frequency ω1 = 4π. To find the frequency in Hz, we can use the formula f1 = ω1 / (2π):\n\nf1 = (4π) / (2π) = 2 Hz\n\nThe second component is a cosine function with amplitude A2 = 3 and angular frequency ω2 = 6π. To find the frequency in Hz, we can use the formula f2 = ω2 / (2π):\n\nf2 = (6π) / (2π) = 3 Hz\n\nSo, the two components of the signal have frequencies of 2 Hz and 3 Hz, with amplitudes of 2 and 3, respectively."
