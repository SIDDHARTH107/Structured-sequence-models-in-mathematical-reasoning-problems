    "message_2": "First, we need to correct the statement: 125 is not a prime number, but rather a power of a prime number (5^3). Now, let's proceed with the proof.\n\nLet G be a group of order 125 = 5^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 mod 5 and divides 125. The only possibilities are 1 and 25. If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, then it is normal and G is a cyclic group of order 125.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups. Let P be one of these subgroups. Since the order of P is 5^2, P is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. If P is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25, as desired.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, then P has an element of order 5 that is not in any other Sylow 5-subgroup. Let Q be another Sylow 5-subgroup. Since P and Q have trivial intersection, there exists an element x in P and an element y in Q such that the order of x is 5 and the order of y is 5. Then, the order of xy is 25, since (xy)^5 = x^5y^5 = e (the identity element).\n\nLet H be the subgroup generated by xy. Since the order of xy is 25, the order of H is 25. Now, we have a subgroup of order 5 (generated by x) and a subgroup of order 25 (H). Their intersection is trivial, and their product has order 5 * 25 = 125. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
