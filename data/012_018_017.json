    "message_2": "Edge connectivity is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges that, when removed, will result in the graph being split into two or more disconnected components.\n\nTo determine the edge connectivity of a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges, we can use Menger's theorem, which states that the edge connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\nSince we don't have the specific details of the graph, we can only provide an upper bound for the edge connectivity. The maximum edge connectivity for a graph with 10 vertices is 9, as each vertex can have at most 9 edges connecting it to the other 9 vertices. However, given that there are only 15 edges in the graph, it is unlikely that the edge connectivity will be this high.\n\nTo find the edge connectivity, we can use the following formula:\n\nEdge connectivity = (2 * number of edges) / number of vertices\n\nIn this case, the edge connectivity would be:\n\nEdge connectivity = (2 * 15) / 10 = 30 / 10 = 3\n\nSo, the edge connectivity of the given graph is at most 3. However, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact edge connectivity."
