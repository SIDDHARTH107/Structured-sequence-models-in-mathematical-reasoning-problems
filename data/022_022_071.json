    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω), we need to compute the following integral:\n\nf(x) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[F(ω) * e^(iωx) dω]\n\nwhere f(x) is the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω), and the integral is taken over the entire range of ω from -∞ to ∞.\n\nGiven F(ω) = 3 / (ω + 4i), let's compute the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(x) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[(3 / (ω + 4i)) * e^(iωx) dω]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the residue theorem from complex analysis. First, we need to find the poles of the integrand. The integrand has a simple pole at ω = -4i.\n\nNow, we need to determine the contour for the integral. Since x can be positive or negative, we need to consider two cases:\n\n1. x > 0: In this case, we close the contour in the upper half-plane. Since there are no poles in the upper half-plane, the integral is zero.\n\n2. x < 0: In this case, we close the contour in the lower half-plane. The pole at ω = -4i is enclosed by the contour. We can now use the residue theorem to compute the integral.\n\nResidue at ω = -4i:\n\nRes = lim_(ω -> -4i) [(ω + 4i) * (3 / (ω + 4i)) * e^(iωx)] = 3 * e^(-4x)\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem:\n\nf(x) = (1 / (2π)) * 2πi * Res = i * 3 * e^(-4x)\n\nSo, the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω) is:\n\nf(x) = 3i * e^(-4x) for x < 0\nf(x) = 0 for x > 0"
