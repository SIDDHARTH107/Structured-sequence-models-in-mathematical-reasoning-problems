    "message_2": "To determine $H^3(X)$, we need more information about the topological space X. Cohomology groups are highly dependent on the structure of the space, and knowing $H^1(X)$ and $H^2(X)$ is not enough to determine $H^3(X)$ in general.\n\nFor example, if X is a real projective plane $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ with a 2-cell attached along a nontrivial loop, then $H^1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $H^2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H^3(X) = 0$. However, if X is a different space with the same cohomology groups in dimensions 1 and 2, the third cohomology group could be different.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the topological space X, it is impossible to determine the value of $H^3(X)$."
