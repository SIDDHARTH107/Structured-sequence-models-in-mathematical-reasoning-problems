    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has at most two vertices with an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex).\n\nIn the given graph, the degrees of each vertex are:\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 2\nD: 2\nE: 4\nF: 2\n\nThere are two vertices with odd degrees (B and E), so the graph has an Eulerian path. One possible Eulerian path is: A-B-D-E-C-F-E-B.\n\nA Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once. The given graph is a simple connected graph, and it has a Hamiltonian path. One possible Hamiltonian path is: A-D-E-B-C-F."
