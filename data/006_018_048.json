    "message_1": "Consider a company where it is known that the probability of an employee committing financial fraud is 0.2. If there are 50 employees in the company, what is the probability that at least 10 of them will commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k employees committing financial fraud\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of employees (50 in this case)\n- k is the number of employees committing financial fraud (we want at least 10)\n- p is the probability of an employee committing financial fraud (0.2)\n\nSince we want the probability of at least 10 employees committing financial fraud, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 10, 11, 12, ..., 50.\n\nSo, the probability of at least 10 employees committing financial fraud is:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9))\n\nNow, we can calculate each probability using the binomial formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9))\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X >= 10) â‰ˆ 0.9629\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 employees will commit financial fraud is approximately 0.9629 or 96.29%."
