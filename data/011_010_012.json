    "message_2": "The student is correct. The number of ways to arrange a set of n pairs of parentheses such that they are all matched correctly is given by the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nFor n = 6, we have:\n\nC(6) = (1/(6+1)) * (12! / (6! * 6!))\n\nC(6) = (1/7) * (479001600 / (720 * 720))\n\nC(6) = (1/7) * (665280)\n\nC(6) = 132\n\nSo, there are 132 ways to arrange 6 pairs of parentheses such that they are all matched correctly."
