    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player 1 is given $50 and must decide how much to give to Player 2. Player 2 then receives the amount given by Player 1 and can choose to give some or all of it back to Player 1. If Player 2 gives some or all of the amount back, the total amount is doubled and split equally between the players. If Player 2 keeps all the money, then Player 1 gets nothing in return. What is the optimal strategy for Player 1 and Player 2 to maximize their winnings? Provide calculations to support your answer.",
    "message_2": "To maximize their winnings, both players should cooperate and trust each other. The optimal strategy for Player 1 is to give the entire $50 to Player 2, and the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to return the entire $50 back to Player 1. Here's why:\n\n1. If Player 1 gives the entire $50 to Player 2, the total amount in play becomes $50.\n\n2. If Player 2 returns the entire $50 back to Player 1, the total amount in play is doubled to $100.\n\n3. The $100 is then split equally between the two players, resulting in each player receiving $50.\n\nThis is the best possible outcome for both players, as they each end up with the same amount they started with ($50). Any other strategy would result in one or both players receiving less than $50.\n\nFor example, if Player 1 gives only $25 to Player 2, and Player 2 returns the entire $25, the total amount in play would be $50 ($25 from Player 1 + $25 from Player 2). This would be doubled to $100, and then split equally between the players, resulting in each player receiving $50. However, in this scenario, Player 1 has taken a risk by giving away $25 and has not gained anything in return.\n\nIn summary, the optimal strategy for both players is to fully cooperate and trust each other. Player 1 should give the entire $50 to Player 2, and Player 2 should return the entire $50 back to Player 1. This will maximize their winnings and result in each player receiving $50."
