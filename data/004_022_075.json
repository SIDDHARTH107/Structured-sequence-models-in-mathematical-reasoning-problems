    "message_1": "A cable company is installing a new optical fiber line to connect two buildings that are 500 meters apart. The company has to choose the path of the cable from the first building to the second one, and it must pass through a park located 200 meters away from the first building. The cost of installation is proportional to the length of the cable, and it costs $6 per meter of cable placed in the park, and $10 per meter of cable placed outside the park.\n\nWhat is the length of cable that should be placed inside the park to minimize the cost of installation and still connect the two buildings?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the cable inside the park, and y be the length of the cable outside the park. The total length of the cable is x + y = 500 meters.\n\nSince the park is 200 meters away from the first building, the cable outside the park forms a right triangle with the cable inside the park. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write the equation:\n\ny^2 = 200^2 + x^2\n\nNow, we need to minimize the cost of installation. The cost function is:\n\nC(x) = 6x + 10y\n\nWe can rewrite the cost function in terms of x using the equation y^2 = 200^2 + x^2:\n\ny = sqrt(200^2 + x^2)\n\nC(x) = 6x + 10 * sqrt(200^2 + x^2)\n\nTo minimize the cost function, we can find its derivative with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dx = 6 + (10 * x) / sqrt(200^2 + x^2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n(10 * x) / sqrt(200^2 + x^2) = -6\n\n10 * x = -6 * sqrt(200^2 + x^2)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n100 * x^2 = 36 * (200^2 + x^2)\n\n100 * x^2 = 36 * 200^2 + 36 * x^2\n\n64 * x^2 = 36 * 200^2\n\nx^2 = (36 * 200^2) / 64\n\nx = sqrt((36 * 200^2) / 64)\n\nx â‰ˆ 150 meters\n\nSo, the length of the cable that should be placed inside the park to minimize the cost of installation and still connect the two buildings is approximately 150 meters."
