    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation u_tt - u_xx = 0 with the given initial conditions, we will use the method of d'Alembert's formula. The general solution to the wave equation is given by:\n\nu(x,t) = f(x+t) + g(x-t),\n\nwhere f and g are arbitrary functions. We need to find these functions using the given initial conditions.\n\nInitial condition 1: u(x,0) = x\nx = f(x) + g(x)\n\nInitial condition 2: u_t(x,0) = cos(x)\nTo find u_t(x,t), we differentiate u(x,t) with respect to t:\n\nu_t(x,t) = f'(x+t) - g'(x-t)\n\nNow, we use the initial condition u_t(x,0) = cos(x):\n\ncos(x) = f'(x) - g'(x)\n\nNow, we have two systems of equations:\n\n1) f(x) + g(x) = x\n2) f'(x) - g'(x) = cos(x)\n\nWe can solve these equations by integrating equation (2) and using equation (1) to find f and g.\n\nIntegrate equation (2) with respect to x:\n\n∫(f'(x) - g'(x)) dx = ∫cos(x) dx\nf(x) - g(x) = sin(x) + C\n\nNow, we can use equation (1) to find the relationship between f(x) and g(x):\n\nf(x) + g(x) = x\nf(x) - g(x) = sin(x) + C\n\nSolve these equations simultaneously:\n\n2f(x) = x + sin(x) + C\nf(x) = (x + sin(x) + C)/2\n\n2g(x) = x - sin(x) - C\ng(x) = (x - sin(x) - C)/2\n\nNow, substitute f(x) and g(x) back into the general solution:\n\nu(x,t) = f(x+t) + g(x-t)\nu(x,t) = ((x+t) + sin(x+t) + C)/2 + ((x-t) - sin(x-t) - C)/2\n\nSince the constant C is arbitrary, we can set it to 0 for simplicity:\n\nu(x,t) = ((x+t) + sin(x+t))/2 + ((x-t) - sin(x-t))/2\n\nThus, the solution to the wave equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\nu(x,t) = ((x+t) + sin(x+t) + (x-t) - sin(x-t))/2"
