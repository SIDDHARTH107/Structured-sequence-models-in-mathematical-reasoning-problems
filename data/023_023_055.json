    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal x(t) = e^(-2t)u(t), we will use the following formula:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nSince x(t) = e^(-2t)u(t), we have:\n\nX(f) = ∫[e^(-2t)u(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nThe unit step function u(t) is equal to 1 for t ≥ 0 and 0 for t < 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nX(f) = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can combine the exponential terms:\n\nX(f) = ∫[e^(-2t - j2πft)] dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet A = -2 - j2πf\nX(f) = ∫[e^(At)] dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, integrate:\n\nX(f) = (-1/A) * e^(At) | from 0 to ∞\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\nX(f) = (-1/A) * [e^(A∞) - e^(A*0)]\nX(f) = (-1/A) * [0 - 1]\nX(f) = 1 / (2 + j2πf)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude and phase spectra:\n\nMagnitude: |X(f)| = 1 / √(2^2 + (2πf)^2)\nPhase: Φ(f) = arctan(-2πf / 2)\n\nTo plot the magnitude and phase spectra, you can use any graphing software or tool. The magnitude spectrum will show how the signal's energy is distributed across different frequencies, and the phase spectrum will show the phase shift of the signal components at different frequencies."
