    "message_2": "The logistic map equation is given by:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the population at time step n, r is the growth rate, and x(n+1) is the population at the next time step.\n\nFor a growth rate of 3.5, the logistic map equation becomes:\n\nx(n+1) = 3.5 * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nPeriod doubling occurs when the system transitions from one stable state to another with twice the period. To find the period doubling equation, we need to apply the logistic map equation twice:\n\nx(n+2) = 3.5 * x(n+1) * (1 - x(n+1))\nx(n+2) = 3.5 * (3.5 * x(n) * (1 - x(n))) * (1 - (3.5 * x(n) * (1 - x(n))))\n\nThis equation represents the period doubling equation for a logistic map with a growth rate of 3.5."
