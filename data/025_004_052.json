    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the parametric representation of the curve C, then find the tangent lines at points P and Q, and finally find their point of intersection.\n\n1. Parametric representation of the curve C:\n\nThe given equation is x^2 - y^2 + 2xy = 1. We can rewrite this as (x + y)^2 - 2y^2 = 1. Let x + y = t, then x = t - y. Substituting x in the equation, we get:\n\n(t - y)^2 - 2y^2 = 1\nt^2 - 2ty + y^2 - 2y^2 = 1\nt^2 - 2ty - y^2 = 1\n\nNow, let's solve for y in terms of t:\n\ny^2 - 2ty + t^2 = 1\ny^2 - 2ty + t^2 - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in y. We can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (2t ± √(4t^2 - 4(t^2 - 1))) / 2\ny = t ± √(4 - 4t^2 + 4t^2)\ny = t ± √4\n\nSo, y = t + 2 or y = t - 2. We can now find the corresponding x values:\n\nx = t - y = t - (t + 2) = -2 (for y = t + 2)\nx = t - y = t - (t - 2) = 2 (for y = t - 2)\n\nThus, the parametric representation of the curve C is:\n\n(x, y) = (2, t - 2) or (x, y) = (-2, t + 2)\n\n2. Tangent lines at points P and Q:\n\nLet P = (2, t1 - 2) and Q = (-2, t2 + 2) be two points on C. To find the tangent lines at P and Q, we need to find the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt:\n\ndx/dt = 0 (since x is constant for both branches)\ndy/dt = 1 (for the branch with y = t - 2)\ndy/dt = 1 (for the branch with y = t + 2)\n\nNow, we can find the slope of the tangent lines at P and Q:\n\nm_P = dy/dt / dx/dt = (1) / (0) (undefined slope)\nm_Q = dy/dt / dx/dt = (1) / (0) (undefined slope)\n\nSince both tangent lines have undefined slopes, they are vertical lines. The equations of the tangent lines at P and Q are:\n\nT_P: x = 2\nT_Q: x = -2\n\n3. Intersection point of tangent lines T_P and T_Q:\n\nSince T_P and T_Q are vertical lines, they intersect at a point with x-coordinate 2 and -2, respectively. However, these points are already on the curve C, so we need to find another intersection point. To do this, we can consider the intersection of T_P with the other branch of C:\n\nT_P: x = 2\nC: (x, y) = (-2, t + 2)\n\nSince x = 2, we have:\n\n2 = -2\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no intersection point of T_P with the other branch of C.\n\nSimilarly, for T_Q:\n\nT_Q: x = -2\nC: (x, y) = (2, t - 2)\n\nSince x = -2, we have:\n\n-2 = 2\nThis is also a contradiction, so there is no intersection point of T_Q with the other branch of C.\n\nThus, there are no points of intersection between the tangent lines T_P and T_Q and the curve C other than the points P and Q themselves."
