    "message_2": "The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin (0,0) of the coordinate plane. To find the exact value of sin(π/6), we need to find the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle π/6 intersects the unit circle.\n\nThe angle π/6 is equivalent to 30 degrees. In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the ratio of the side lengths is 1:√3:2. If we consider a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse 2, the side opposite the 30-degree angle (which is the y-coordinate on the unit circle) is half the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, in this case, the y-coordinate (which represents the sine value) is half of the hypotenuse of the 30-60-90 triangle:\n\nsin(π/6) = sin(30°) = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the exact value of sin(π/6) is 1/2."
