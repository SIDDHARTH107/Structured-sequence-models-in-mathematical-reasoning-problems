    "message_2": "To prove that $G$ is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element $g \\in G$ such that every element in $G$ can be written as a power of $g$. In other words, we need to show that $G = \\langle g \\rangle$.\n\nSince $G$ has order $p$, there are $p$ elements in $G$. By the definition of a group, one of these elements is the identity element, which we will denote by $e$. Now, consider any non-identity element $g \\in G$. We will show that $G = \\langle g \\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we know that $g^0 = e$, so the identity element is in $\\langle g \\rangle$. Now, let's consider the powers of $g$: $g^1, g^2, \\dots, g^{p-1}$. We claim that all these powers are distinct and non-identity elements of $G$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist integers $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \\leq i < j \\leq p-1$ and $g^i = g^j$. Then, we have:\n\n$g^i g^{-i} = g^j g^{-i} \\Rightarrow g^{j-i} = e$\n\nSince $1 \\leq j-i \\leq p-1$, this contradicts the fact that $g$ has order $p$. Therefore, all the powers $g^1, g^2, \\dots, g^{p-1}$ are distinct and non-identity elements of $G$.\n\nNow, we have $p-1$ distinct non-identity elements in $\\langle g \\rangle$, along with the identity element $e$. This means that $\\langle g \\rangle$ has $p$ elements, which is the same as the order of $G$. Since $\\langle g \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$, and they have the same order, we must have $G = \\langle g \\rangle$. Thus, $G$ is cyclic, as desired."
