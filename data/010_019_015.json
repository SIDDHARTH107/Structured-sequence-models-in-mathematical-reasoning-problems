    "message_1": "Consider the Morse function $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$ on the domain $D = [-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]$. Determine the Morse homology groups of $D$ with respect to $f$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology groups, we first need to find the critical points of the Morse function $f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2$. The critical points are the points where the gradient of $f$ is zero, i.e., $\\nabla f(x, y) = 0$. We have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2y$\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:\n\n$2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n$-2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, which is $(0, 0)$. Now we need to compute the Hessian matrix of $f$ at this critical point:\n\n$H_f(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe Hessian matrix has two non-zero eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have different signs, the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a saddle point. The index of this saddle point is the number of negative eigenvalues, which is 1.\n\nNow we can compute the Morse homology groups. The Morse complex is given by:\n\n$C_k = \\{ \\text{critical points of index } k \\}$\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n$C_0 = \\emptyset$\n$C_1 = \\{ (0, 0) \\}$\n$C_2 = \\emptyset$\n\nThe boundary operator $\\partial_k: C_k \\rightarrow C_{k-1}$ is defined as follows:\n\n$\\partial_k(c) = \\sum_{c' \\in C_{k-1}} n(c, c') \\cdot c'$\n\nwhere $n(c, c')$ is the number of gradient flow lines from $c$ to $c'$ with respect to the Morse function $f$. Since there are no critical points of index 0 and 2, the boundary operator is trivial:\n\n$\\partial_0 = 0$\n$\\partial_1 = 0$\n$\\partial_2 = 0$\n\nFinally, we can compute the Morse homology groups as the homology of the Morse complex:\n\n$H_k = \\ker \\partial_k / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_{k+1}$\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n$H_0 = \\ker \\partial_0 / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_1 = 0 / 0 = 0$\n$H_1 = \\ker \\partial_1 / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_2 = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n$H_2 = \\ker \\partial_2 / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_3 = 0 / 0 = 0$\n\nThus, the Morse homology groups of $D$ with respect to $f$ are:\n\n$H_0 = 0$\n$H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n$H_2 = 0$"
