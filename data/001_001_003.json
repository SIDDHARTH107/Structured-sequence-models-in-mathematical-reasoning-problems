    "message_2": "To solve the equation 3x + 5 = 14, we need to isolate the variable x. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.\n3x + 5 - 5 = 14 - 5\n3x = 9\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3.\n3x / 3 = 9 / 3\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 3x + 5 = 14 is x = 3."
