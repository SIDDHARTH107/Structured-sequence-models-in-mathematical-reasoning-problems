    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 4sin(x) + 3cos(x) for x between 0 and 2π, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(A + B) = sin(A)cos(B) + cos(A)sin(B)\n\nLet A = x and B = α, then we have:\n\nf(x) = 4sin(x) + 3cos(x) = Rsin(x + α)\n\nwhere R = √((4^2) + (3^2)) = 5 (by Pythagorean theorem)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of α such that:\n\n4 = Rcos(α) = 5cos(α) => cos(α) = 4/5\n3 = Rsin(α) = 5sin(α) => sin(α) = 3/5\n\nNow, we have f(x) = 5sin(x + α). The maximum value of the sine function is 1, so the maximum value of f(x) is:\n\nf_max = 5 * 1 = 5\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the function f(x) = 4sin(x) + 3cos(x) for x between 0 and 2π is 5."
