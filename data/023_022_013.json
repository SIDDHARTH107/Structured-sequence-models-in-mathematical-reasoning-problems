    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the data series, we will use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) formula:\n\nX(k) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-2πi * k * n / N)]\n\nwhere X(k) is the k-th Fourier coefficient, x(n) is the n-th data point, N is the total number of data points, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe data series has 12 data points:\n\nx(0) = -0.02, x(1) = -0.01, x(2) = 0.01, x(3) = 0.05, x(4) = 0.06, x(5) = -0.03, x(6) = -0.04, x(7) = 0.02, x(8) = 0.03, x(9) = -0.01, x(10) = -0.04, x(11) = 0.01\n\nWe will calculate the Fourier coefficients X(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., 11:\n\nX(0) = Σ [x(n)] = -0.02 - 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.05 + 0.06 - 0.03 - 0.04 + 0.02 + 0.03 - 0.01 - 0.04 + 0.01 = 0.03\n\nFor k = 1, ..., 11, we have:\n\nX(k) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-2πi * k * n / 12)]\n\nCalculating the Fourier coefficients, we get:\n\nX(1) = -0.018 + 0.001i\nX(2) = -0.042 - 0.046i\nX(3) = 0.018 - 0.001i\nX(4) = 0.042 + 0.046i\nX(5) = -0.018 + 0.001i\nX(6) = 0.018 + 0.001i\nX(7) = -0.018 + 0.001i\nX(8) = 0.042 + 0.046i\nX(9) = 0.018 - 0.001i\nX(10) = -0.042 - 0.046i\nX(11) = -0.018 + 0.001i\n\nNow, we will find the amplitude and frequency of the dominant cycles in the data. The amplitude is given by the absolute value of the Fourier coefficients:\n\nA(k) = |X(k)|\n\nThe frequency is given by:\n\nf(k) = k / N\n\nCalculating the amplitudes and frequencies, we get:\n\nA(1) = 0.018, f(1) = 1/12\nA(2) = 0.062, f(2) = 2/12\nA(3) = 0.018, f(3) = 3/12\nA(4) = 0.062, f(4) = 4/12\nA(5) = 0.018, f(5) = 5/12\nA(6) = 0.018, f(6) = 6/12\nA(7) = 0.018, f(7) = 7/12\nA(8) = 0.062, f(8) = 8/12\nA(9) = 0.018, f(9) = 9/12\nA(10) = 0.062, f(10) = 10/12\nA(11) = 0.018, f(11) = 11/12\n\nThe dominant cycles are those with the highest amplitudes. In this case, we have four dominant cycles with equal amplitudes of 0.062:\n\n- Cycle 1: Amplitude = 0.062, Frequency = 2/12 = 1/6\n- Cycle 2: Amplitude = 0.062, Frequency = 4/12 = 1/3\n- Cycle 3: Amplitude = 0.062, Frequency = 8/12 = 2/3\n- Cycle 4: Amplitude = 0.062, Frequency = 10/12 = 5/6"
