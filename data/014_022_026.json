    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher encrypted message, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key \"MATHS\". \n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS (no duplicates)\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J) in order: MATHSBCDEFGIKLPQRUVWXYZ\n\nNow, we have the 5x5 Playfair matrix:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L P\nQ R U V W\nX Y Z\n\nNext, we will decrypt the message \"OYSBKAHNQCCE\" using the Playfair matrix:\n\n1. Break the message into digraphs: OY SB KA HN QC CE\n2. For each digraph, find the corresponding plaintext letters using the matrix:\n\n   - OY: O is in row 3, column 2 and Y is in row 4, column 4. They are in different rows and columns, so replace O with the letter in the same row and the column to the left (G), and replace Y with the letter in the same row and the column to the left (U). The decrypted digraph is GU.\n   \n   - SB: S is in row 0, column 4 and B is in row 1, column 0. They are in different rows and columns, so replace S with the letter in the same row and the column to the left (H), and replace B with the letter in the same row and the column to the left (F). The decrypted digraph is HF.\n   \n   - KA: K is in row 2, column 2 and A is in row 0, column 1. They are in different rows and columns, so replace K with the letter in the same row and the column to the left (I), and replace A with the letter in the same row and the column to the left (M). The decrypted digraph is IM.\n   \n   - HN: H is in row 0, column 3 and N is in row 2, column 3. They are in the same column, so replace H with the letter above it (D) and replace N with the letter above it (T). The decrypted digraph is DT.\n   \n   - QC: Q is in row 3, column 0 and C is in row 1, column 2. They are in different rows and columns, so replace Q with the letter in the same row and the column to the left (P), and replace C with the letter in the same row and the column to the left (B). The decrypted digraph is PB.\n   \n   - CE: C is in row 1, column 2 and E is in row 1, column 4. They are in the same row, so replace C with the letter to the left (B) and replace E with the letter to the left (D). The decrypted digraph is BD.\n\n3. Combine the decrypted digraphs: GU HF IM DT PB BD\n\nThe plaintext message is \"GUHFIMDTPBBD\"."
