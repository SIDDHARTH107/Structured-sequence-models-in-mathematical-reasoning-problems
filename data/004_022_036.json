    "message_1": "A company produces two types of smartphones, A and B. It has a production cost of $150 for each unit of A and $200 for each unit of B. The selling prices of A and B are $250 and $300, respectively. The demand for A is at most 70 units, and the demand for B is at most 50 units. However, the total production capacity of the company is at most 100 units. What is the maximum profit that the company can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of smartphone A produced and y be the number of units of smartphone B produced.\n\nThe profit for each unit of A is $250 - $150 = $100, and the profit for each unit of B is $300 - $200 = $100.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. The demand for A: x ≤ 70\n2. The demand for B: y ≤ 50\n3. The total production capacity: x + y ≤ 100\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nP(x, y) = 100x + 100y\n\nSince the profit per unit is the same for both smartphones, we want to maximize the number of units produced within the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's consider the constraint x + y ≤ 100. If we produce the maximum number of units of A (x = 70), we can still produce 30 units of B (y = 30) without exceeding the total production capacity. In this case, the total number of units produced is 70 + 30 = 100.\n\nNow, let's consider the constraint y ≤ 50. If we produce the maximum number of units of B (y = 50), we can still produce 50 units of A (x = 50) without exceeding the total production capacity. In this case, the total number of units produced is 50 + 50 = 100.\n\nSince both scenarios result in the same total number of units produced (100), we can choose either one. The maximum profit will be the same in both cases:\n\nP(x, y) = 100x + 100y = 100(70) + 100(30) = 100(50) + 100(50) = 100(100) = $10,000\n\nSo the maximum profit the company can make is $10,000."
