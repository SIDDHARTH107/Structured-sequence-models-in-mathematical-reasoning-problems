    "message_2": "To solve this convex optimization problem, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's define the Lagrangian function L(x, λ) as follows:\n\nL(x, λ) = f(x) - λ * g(x)\n\nHere, f(x) is the objective function, g(x) is the constraint function, and λ is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nL(x, λ) = (3x^2 + 2x + 1) - λ * (x - 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L(x, λ) with respect to x and λ, and set them to zero to find the stationary points:\n\n∂L/∂x = 6x + 2 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x - 2 = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we find that x = 2. Plugging this value into the first equation, we get:\n\n6(2) + 2 - λ = 0\n12 + 2 - λ = 0\nλ = 14\n\nNow, we have the values x = 2 and λ = 14. Since the constraint g(x) = x - 2 ≤ 0 is satisfied, this is a feasible solution. To find the maximum value of f(x), we plug x = 2 back into the objective function:\n\nf(2) = 3(2)^2 + 2(2) + 1\nf(2) = 3(4) + 4 + 1\nf(2) = 12 + 4 + 1\nf(2) = 17\n\nThus, the maximum value of f(x) is 17, and it occurs at x = 2."
