    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 6 cm, one base of 9 cm, and a smaller base of 5 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 6 cm, the larger base is 9 cm, and the smaller base is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (9 + 5) * 6\nArea = (1/2) * 14 * 6\nArea = 7 * 6\nArea = 42 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 42 square centimeters."
