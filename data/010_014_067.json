    "message_2": "If Y is a topological space that is homotopy equivalent to X, then there exist continuous maps f: X → Y and g: Y → X such that g ∘ f is homotopic to the identity map on X, and f ∘ g is homotopic to the identity map on Y.\n\nCohomology groups are homotopy invariants, which means that if two spaces are homotopy equivalent, their cohomology groups are isomorphic. Since X and Y are homotopy equivalent, their cohomology groups are isomorphic, and thus H^2(Y) is isomorphic to H^2(X).\n\nTherefore, the cohomology group H^2(Y) is isomorphic to Z/2Z."
