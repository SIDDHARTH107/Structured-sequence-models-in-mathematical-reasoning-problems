    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p\n\nIf the algorithm works correctly, K_A and K_B should be equal.\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\n1. A = 2^4 mod 11 = 16 mod 11 = 5\n2. B = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\n3. K_A = 8^4 mod 11 = 4096 mod 11 = 1\n4. K_B = 5^3 mod 11 = 125 mod 11 = 1\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob agreed upon is K_A = K_B = 1."
