    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. According to the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides |G|, so n_3 divides 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. The only divisors that satisfy the second condition are 1 and 9. Let's consider each case:\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of this subgroup is 3^2 = 9, the group G is a semi-direct product of this normal subgroup and a subgroup of order 3. However, since the order of G is 3^3, the group G must be cyclic, generated by an element of order 27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 9\nIn this case, there are 9 Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P be one of these subgroups, with |P| = 9. Since P is a group of order 9, it must be cyclic (as 9 is a prime power). Let Q be a subgroup of G with |Q| = 3. Then, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, as |P âˆ© Q| = 1 and |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 27. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G can either be cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, depending on the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G."
