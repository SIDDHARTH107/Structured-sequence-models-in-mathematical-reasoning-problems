    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the graph to determine if an Eulerian path and a Hamiltonian path exist.\n\nAn Eulerian path is a path that visits every edge exactly once. For an Eulerian path to exist in a graph, either all vertices must have an even degree, or exactly two vertices must have an odd degree.\n\nDegree of each vertex in the graph:\n- A: 3 (odd)\n- B: 3 (odd)\n- C: 2 (even)\n- D: 2 (even)\n- E: 2 (even)\n\nSince there are exactly two vertices with an odd degree (A and B), an Eulerian path exists in this graph.\n\nA Hamiltonian path is a path that visits every vertex exactly once. It is an NP-complete problem, so there is no efficient algorithm to determine if a Hamiltonian path exists. However, we can try to find one by inspection.\n\nNow, let's find the Eulerian path and Hamiltonian path for this graph.\n\nEulerian Path:\n1. Start at vertex A (since it has an odd degree).\n2. Follow the edges in the order: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E, E-B, B-A.\n3. The Eulerian path is A-B-C-D-E-B-A.\n\nHamiltonian Path:\n1. Start at vertex A.\n2. Follow the edges in the order: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E.\n3. The Hamiltonian path is A-B-C-D-E.\n\nIn conclusion, the Eulerian path for this graph is A-B-C-D-E-B-A, and the Hamiltonian path is A-B-C-D-E."
