    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle in a hyperbolic plane, we need to first find the lengths of the sides and then use the hyperbolic law of cosines to find the angles. Finally, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the area.\n\n1. Find the lengths of the sides:\nWe can use the hyperbolic distance formula to find the lengths of the sides. The formula is:\n\nd(P, Q) = arcosh(1 + (2 * |P - Q|^2) / (curvature * (1 - curvature * |P - Q|^2)))\n\nwhere P and Q are the points, |P - Q|^2 is the squared Euclidean distance between the points, and arcosh is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function.\n\nLet's find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and CA:\n\nAB:\n|A - B|^2 = (3 - 1)^2 + (2 - 5)^2 = 4 + 9 = 13\nd(A, B) = arcosh(1 + (2 * 13) / (-1.5 * (1 - (-1.5 * 13)))) ≈ 2.28\n\nBC:\n|B - C|^2 = (1 - (-4))^2 + (5 - (-1))^2 = 25 + 36 = 61\nd(B, C) = arcosh(1 + (2 * 61) / (-1.5 * (1 - (-1.5 * 61)))) ≈ 3.92\n\nCA:\n|C - A|^2 = (-4 - 3)^2 + (-1 - 2)^2 = 49 + 9 = 58\nd(C, A) = arcosh(1 + (2 * 58) / (-1.5 * (1 - (-1.5 * 58)))) ≈ 3.84\n\n2. Find the angles:\nNow we can use the hyperbolic law of cosines to find the angles:\n\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) - sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths, and C is the angle opposite side c.\n\nLet's find the angles A, B, and C:\n\nA:\ncosh(2.28) = cosh(3.92) * cosh(3.84) - sinh(3.92) * sinh(3.84) * cos(A)\ncos(A) ≈ -0.9998\nA ≈ arccos(-0.9998) ≈ 2.63 radians\n\nB:\ncosh(3.92) = cosh(2.28) * cosh(3.84) - sinh(2.28) * sinh(3.84) * cos(B)\ncos(B) ≈ -0.9999\nB ≈ arccos(-0.9999) ≈ 2.64 radians\n\nC:\ncosh(3.84) = cosh(2.28) * cosh(3.92) - sinh(2.28) * sinh(3.92) * cos(C)\ncos(C) ≈ -0.9997\nC ≈ arccos(-0.9997) ≈ 2.62 radians\n\n3. Find the area:\nNow we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the area:\n\nArea = π - (A + B + C)\n\nArea = π - (2.63 + 2.64 + 2.62) ≈ -2.89 radians\n\nHowever, the area cannot be negative. The negative value indicates that we have made an error in our calculations, likely due to the fact that the given points A, B, and C are not valid points on a hyperbolic plane with a curvature of -1.5. In a hyperbolic plane, the coordinates of the points should be given in a different form, such as the Poincaré disk model or the upper half-plane model."
