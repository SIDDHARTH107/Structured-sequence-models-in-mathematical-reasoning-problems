    "message_1": "Consider the Mackey-Glass equation given by: \n\ndx/dt = 0.2x(t - τ) / [1 + (x(t - τ))^10] - 0.1x(t)\n\nwhere x is a function of time t and τ is the time delay parameter.\n\nGiven the initial condition x(0) = 1.5 and τ = 17, find the values of x(t) at time t = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with a time step size of h = 0.01.",
    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method, we first need to define the function f(t, x) representing the right-hand side of the equation:\n\nf(t, x) = 0.2 * x(t - τ) / [1 + (x(t - τ))^10] - 0.1 * x(t)\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with a time step size of h = 0.01:\n\n1. Initialize the values:\n   x(0) = 1.5\n   τ = 17\n   h = 0.01\n\n2. Define the function f(t, x):\n\n   def f(t, x, x_delayed):\n       return 0.2 * x_delayed / (1 + x_delayed**10) - 0.1 * x\n\n3. Implement the fourth order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n   def runge_kutta(t, x, h, x_delayed):\n       k1 = h * f(t, x, x_delayed)\n       k2 = h * f(t + h/2, x + k1/2, x_delayed)\n       k3 = h * f(t + h/2, x + k2/2, x_delayed)\n       k4 = h * f(t + h, x + k3, x_delayed)\n       return x + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n\n4. Since τ = 17, we need to store the values of x(t) for t = -17 to 0 to compute x(t - τ) for t = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. We assume x(t) = 1.5 for t <= 0:\n\n   x_values = [1.5] * (17 * 100 + 1)  # 1701 values for t = -17 to 0 with a step of 0.01\n\n5. Now, we can compute the values of x(t) for t = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n   t = 0\n   for i in range(1701, 1701 + 30):  # 30 steps to reach t = 0.3 with a step of 0.01\n       x_delayed = x_values[i - 17 * 100]  # x(t - τ)\n       x_new = runge_kutta(t, x_values[-1], h, x_delayed)\n       x_values.append(x_new)\n       t += h\n\n6. The values of x(t) at t = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 are:\n\n   x(0.1) = x_values[1710] ≈ 1.499\n   x(0.2) = x_values[1720] ≈ 1.498\n   x(0.3) = x_values[1730] ≈ 1.497\n\nPlease note that these values are approximate due to the numerical nature of the Runge-Kutta method."
