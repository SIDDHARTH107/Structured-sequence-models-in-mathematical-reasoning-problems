    "message_2": "To find the particular solution to the given differential equation, we first need to find the general solution. The differential equation is a first-order linear equation, and it can be solved by integrating both sides with respect to x.\n\ndy/dx = 2x + 1\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(dy/dx) dx = ∫(2x + 1) dx\n\ny = ∫(2x + 1) dx\n\nNow, integrate the right side:\n\ny = x^2 + x + C\n\nWe are given the initial condition y(0) = 3. Plug in x = 0 and y = 3 to find the constant C:\n\n3 = (0)^2 + (0) + C\n\n3 = C\n\nNow, we have the particular solution:\n\ny = x^2 + x + 3"
