    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.1, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function for the Mackey-Glass equation.\n2. Implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n3. Iterate through the time steps and calculate the value of x at each step.\n4. Find the value of x(100).\n\nLet's start by defining the function for the Mackey-Glass equation:\n\n```python\ndef mackey_glass(t, x, x_delayed):\n    return 0.2 * x_delayed / (1 + x_delayed**10) - 0.1 * x\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\ndef runge_kutta_4(t, x, h, x_delayed):\n    k1 = h * mackey_glass(t, x, x_delayed)\n    k2 = h * mackey_glass(t + h/2, x + k1/2, x_delayed)\n    k3 = h * mackey_glass(t + h/2, x + k2/2, x_delayed)\n    k4 = h * mackey_glass(t + h, x + k3, x_delayed)\n    \n    return x + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n```\n\nNow we can iterate through the time steps and calculate the value of x at each step:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Parameters\nt0 = 0\ntf = 100\nh = 0.1\nx0 = 1.5\ndelay = 17\n\n# Time steps\nt = np.arange(t0, tf + h, h)\nn = len(t)\n\n# Initialize x array\nx = np.zeros(n)\nx[0] = x0\n\n# Iterate through time steps\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    t_current = t[i-1]\n    x_current = x[i-1]\n    \n    # Calculate x_delayed\n    if t_current < delay:\n        x_delayed = x0\n    else:\n        x_delayed = x[i - int(delay/h)]\n    \n    # Update x using Runge-Kutta method\n    x[i] = runge_kutta_4(t_current, x_current, h, x_delayed)\n\n# Find the value of x(100)\nx_100 = x[-1]\n```\n\nThe value of x(100) is approximately:\n\n```python\nprint(x_100)\n```\n\nKeep in mind that the result may vary slightly depending on the numerical accuracy of the implementation."
