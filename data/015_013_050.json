    "message_2": "The first period-doubling bifurcation point in the logistic equation $x_{n+1} = rx_n(1-x_n)$ occurs when the system transitions from a stable fixed point to a stable 2-cycle. To find this value of r, we first need to find the fixed points of the equation by setting $x_{n+1} = x_n = x$:\n\n$x = rx(1-x)$\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n$x(1-r) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two fixed points: $x = 0$ and $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$.\n\nNext, we need to find the stability of these fixed points by taking the derivative of the logistic equation with respect to $x_n$:\n\n$\\frac{dx_{n+1}}{dx_n} = r - 2rx_n$\n\nAt the fixed point $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$, the derivative is:\n\n$\\frac{dx_{n+1}}{dx_n} = r - 2r\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) = r - 2r + 2 = 2 - r$\n\nThe first period-doubling bifurcation occurs when the magnitude of this derivative is equal to 1:\n\n$|2 - r| = 1$\n\nSolving for r, we get two possible values: $r = 1$ and $r = 3$. However, the first period-doubling bifurcation occurs at the larger value of r, which is:\n\n$r = 3$\n\nSo, the logistic equation exhibits its first period-doubling bifurcation point at $r = 3$."
