    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (x^2 + 1)^3 using the chain rule, we first identify the outer function and the inner function. In this case, the outer function is g(u) = u^3, and the inner function is h(x) = x^2 + 1.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of the outer and inner functions:\n\ng'(u) = 3u^2\nh'(x) = 2x\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\nf'(x) = 3(x^2 + 1)^2 * 2x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (x^2 + 1)^3 is:\n\nf'(x) = 6x(x^2 + 1)^2"
