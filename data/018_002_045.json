In this case, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we need to verify that this intersection is a subset of both set A and set B.\n\nA subset is a set that contains only elements that are also in another set. In other words, if set C is a subset of set D, then every element in set C must also be an element in set D.\n\nLet's check if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nBoth elements in the intersection (2 and 4) are also elements of set A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nBoth elements in the intersection (2 and 4) are also elements of set B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nSince A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B, we have verified that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of each of these sets."
