    "message_1": "A company is considering entering a Stackelberg competition as the follower. The leader has a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit and demand function of $120 - 2Q$. The follower must choose its quantity after observing the leader's quantity. The follower has a marginal cost of $20 per unit. What quantity should the follower produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal quantity for the follower, we first need to find the reaction function of the leader. The profit function for the leader is given by:\n\nπ_leader = (P - MC_leader) * Q_leader\n\nwhere P is the price, MC_leader is the marginal cost of the leader, and Q_leader is the quantity produced by the leader. We know that the demand function is P = 120 - 2Q, where Q is the total quantity produced by both the leader and the follower. So, the profit function for the leader can be written as:\n\nπ_leader = ((120 - 2(Q_leader + Q_follower)) - 10) * Q_leader\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order condition for the leader's profit maximization:\n\nd(π_leader)/dQ_leader = 0\n\nDifferentiating the profit function with respect to Q_leader, we get:\n\n-2Q_leader - 2Q_follower + 110 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Q_leader in terms of Q_follower:\n\nQ_leader = 55 - Q_follower\n\nThis is the reaction function of the leader.\n\nNext, we need to find the profit function for the follower:\n\nπ_follower = (P - MC_follower) * Q_follower\n\nSubstituting the demand function and the leader's reaction function, we get:\n\nπ_follower = ((120 - 2(Q_leader + Q_follower)) - 20) * Q_follower\nπ_follower = ((120 - 2(55 - Q_follower + Q_follower)) - 20) * Q_follower\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nπ_follower = (10 + 2Q_follower) * Q_follower\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order condition for the follower's profit maximization:\n\nd(π_follower)/dQ_follower = 0\n\nDifferentiating the profit function with respect to Q_follower, we get:\n\n2Q_follower + 10 = 0\n\nSolving for Q_follower, we find:\n\nQ_follower = -5\n\nHowever, a negative quantity does not make sense in this context. Therefore, the follower should produce 0 units to maximize its profit."
