    "message_2": "There are three possible isomorphism classes for a group of order 8:\n\n1. The cyclic group C8: This group has one element of order 8 and is generated by a single element. It is the simplest group of order 8 and is abelian.\n\n2. The quaternion group Q8: This group has elements of order 4 and is non-abelian. It consists of 8 elements: {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, where i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\n\n3. The dihedral group D4: This group represents the symmetries of a square and has elements of order 2 and 4. It is also non-abelian and has 8 elements.\n\nAny group of order 8 must be isomorphic to one of these three groups. To see why, consider the Sylow theorems. A group of order 8 has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, the number of such subgroups must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\nNow, consider the possible structures of this normal Sylow 2-subgroup. It could be cyclic, in which case the group is isomorphic to C8. If it is not cyclic, it must have an element of order 4. If the group is generated by this element and another element of order 2, then it is isomorphic to D4. If the group is generated by this element and another element of order 4, then it is isomorphic to Q8. Thus, any group of order 8 must be isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4."
