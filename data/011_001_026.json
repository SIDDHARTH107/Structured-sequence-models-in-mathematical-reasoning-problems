    "message_2": "To find the number of different groups of 4 students that can be selected from a class of 10 students, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (10 in this case) and k is the number of students to be selected (4 in this case).\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(6*5*4*3*2*1))\n\nC(10, 4) = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different groups of 4 students that can be selected from the class."
