If the system is unstable, find a value of the damping coefficient such that the system becomes marginally stable.",
    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the mass-spring-damper system, we first need to rewrite the given differential equation in terms of the given parameters:\n\n$$0.5x'' + 2x' + 100x = 0$$\n\nNow, let's take the Fourier transform of the equation. The Fourier transform of the second derivative is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{x''\\} = (j\\omega)^2X(\\omega) = -\\omega^2X(\\omega)$$\n\nAnd the Fourier transform of the first derivative is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{x'\\} = j\\omega X(\\omega)$$\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to the entire equation, we get:\n\n$$-0.5\\omega^2X(\\omega) + 2j\\omega X(\\omega) + 100X(\\omega) = 0$$\n\nNow, let's find the characteristic equation by setting the equation in terms of X(Ï‰) to zero:\n\n$$-0.5\\omega^2 + 2j\\omega + 100 = 0$$\n\nTo find the roots of this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$\\omega = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn our case, a = -0.5, b = 2j, and c = 100. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$$\\omega = \\frac{-2j \\pm \\sqrt{(2j)^2 - 4(-0.5)(100)}}{-1}$$\n\nSimplifying the expression under the square root:\n\n$$(2j)^2 = 4j^2 = -4$$\n\n$$-4(-0.5)(100) = 200$$\n\nSo, the expression under the square root becomes:\n\n$$\\sqrt{-4 + 200} = \\sqrt{196} = 14$$\n\nNow, we can find the roots:\n\n$$\\omega_1 = \\frac{-2j + 14}{-1} = 2j - 14$$\n\n$$\\omega_2 = \\frac{-2j - 14}{-1} = -2j + 14$$\n\nSince the real parts of both roots are negative, the system is stable.\n\nHowever, if we want to find the value of the damping coefficient (b) such that the system becomes marginally stable, we need to find the value of b for which the real parts of the roots are equal to zero. In other words, we want the roots to be purely imaginary.\n\nLet's rewrite the characteristic equation with the new damping coefficient b:\n\n$$-0.5\\omega^2 + bj\\omega + 100 = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula again:\n\n$$\\omega = \\frac{-bj \\pm \\sqrt{(bj)^2 - 4(-0.5)(100)}}{-1}$$\n\nFor the system to be marginally stable, the real part of the roots should be zero, so the expression under the square root should be equal to $(bj)^2$. Therefore:\n\n$$(bj)^2 = 4(-0.5)(100)$$\n\nSolving for b:\n\n$$b^2 = \\frac{4(100)}{0.5}$$\n\n$$b^2 = 800$$\n\n$$b = \\sqrt{800} \\approx 28.28$$\n\nSo, the value of the damping coefficient that makes the system marginally stable is approximately 28.28 Ns/m."
