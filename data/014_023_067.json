    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted a Rail fence cipher message with the following ciphertext:\n```\nTSMHENIYETFREAESAEIHGLOAEIOMTYF\n```\nKnowing that the plaintext message was originally written in rows of 5, and the key was 3, what is the original plaintext message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail Fence cipher, we need to arrange the ciphertext back into the zigzag pattern with the given key (3) and then read the plaintext message row by row. The ciphertext is:\n\n```\nTSMHENIYETFREAESAEIHGLOAEIOMTYF\n```\n\nFirst, we need to determine the length of each row in the zigzag pattern. The plaintext message was originally written in rows of 5, so the total length of the message is 5 * 3 = 15. Since the key is 3, there will be 3 rows in the zigzag pattern.\n\nRow 1: Every 4th character starting from the 1st character.\nRow 2: Every 2nd character starting from the 2nd character, and every 4th character starting from the 3rd character.\nRow 3: Every 4th character starting from the 4th character.\n\nNow, we can arrange the ciphertext into the zigzag pattern:\n\n```\nT . . . M . . . E . . . A . . .\n. S . H . N . Y . T . R . E . S\n. . I . . . . F . . . . A . . .\n```\n\nReading the plaintext message row by row, we get:\n\n```\nTHEMYSTERIESOFMATHEMATICS\n```\n\nSo, the original plaintext message is \"THE MYSTERIES OF MATHEMATICS\"."
