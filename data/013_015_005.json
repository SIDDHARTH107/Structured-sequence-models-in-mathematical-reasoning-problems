    "message_1": "A principal hires an agent to perform a task. The agent has a choice of effort levels to exert, either high effort (H) or low effort (L). The probability of success for each effort level is:\n\n- H: 80%\n- L: 40%\n\nThe principal can offer the agent a bonus of $100 for high effort, but no bonus for low effort. The agent's utility from effort and bonus is as follows:\n\n- H, bonus: $500\n- H, no bonus: $300\n- L, bonus: $200\n- L, no bonus: $100\n\nAssuming the agent is risk-neutral, what effort level will the agent choose, and what payoff will the principal receive?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effort level the agent will choose, we need to compare the expected utility of each effort level given the bonus structure.\n\nFor high effort (H):\n- If the agent exerts high effort and succeeds, they receive a bonus of $100, so their utility is $500.\n- If the agent exerts high effort and fails, they receive no bonus, so their utility is $300.\n- The probability of success with high effort is 80%, so the expected utility of high effort is (0.8 * $500) + (0.2 * $300) = $400 + $60 = $460.\n\nFor low effort (L):\n- If the agent exerts low effort and succeeds, they receive no bonus, so their utility is $100.\n- If the agent exerts low effort and fails, they receive no bonus, so their utility is $100.\n- The probability of success with low effort is 40%, so the expected utility of low effort is (0.4 * $100) + (0.6 * $100) = $40 + $60 = $100.\n\nSince the expected utility of high effort ($460) is greater than the expected utility of low effort ($100), the agent will choose to exert high effort.\n\nNow, let's calculate the payoff for the principal. The principal receives a payoff of $1000 if the task is successful and $0 if it is not. Since the agent chooses high effort, the probability of success is 80%. Therefore, the expected payoff for the principal is (0.8 * $1000) + (0.2 * $0) = $800 + $0 = $800."
