    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. The maximum independent set is the largest possible independent set in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, we can find a maximum independent set by selecting the following vertices: {A, D, F}. No two vertices in this set are adjacent, and it is not possible to add any more vertices to the set without violating the adjacency condition.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is 3."
