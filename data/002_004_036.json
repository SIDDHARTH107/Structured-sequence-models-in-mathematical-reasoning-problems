    "message_1": "A rectangular field has a length of 25 meters and a width of 15 meters. What is the perimeter of the field?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).\n\nIn this case, the length is 25 meters and the width is 15 meters. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(25 + 15)\nPerimeter = 2(40)\nPerimeter = 80 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the field is 80 meters."
