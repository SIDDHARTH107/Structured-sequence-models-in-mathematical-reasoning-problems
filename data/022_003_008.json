    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of the function f(z) = z^3/(z-2) over the circle |z| = 3 using Cauchy's integral formula, we first need to identify if there are any singularities within the contour. In this case, there is a singularity at z = 2, which lies inside the circle |z| = 3.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function f(z) as a sum of its analytic part and its singular part:\n\nf(z) = g(z) + h(z),\n\nwhere g(z) is the analytic part and h(z) is the singular part. In our case, we have:\n\ng(z) = z^3 and h(z) = 1/(z-2).\n\nNow, we can use Cauchy's integral formula to find the integral of f(z) over the circle |z| = 3. The formula states that for an analytic function g(z) and a simple closed contour C,\n\n∮[g(z) * h(z)]dz = 2πi * g(a) * n(C, a),\n\nwhere a is the singularity, n(C, a) is the winding number of the contour C around the point a, and the integral is taken over the contour C.\n\nIn our case, the singularity a = 2, and the winding number n(C, a) = 1 since the contour is a circle centered at the origin with radius 3, and the singularity is inside the contour.\n\nNow, we can find g(a) = g(2) = 2^3 = 8.\n\nSo, the integral of f(z) over the circle |z| = 3 is:\n\n∮[f(z)]dz = 2πi * g(2) * n(C, 2) = 2πi * 8 * 1 = 16πi."
