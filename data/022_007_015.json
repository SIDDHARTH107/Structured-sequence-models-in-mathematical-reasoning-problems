Use Liouville's theorem to prove that f(z) is a constant function. \n\nOnce you have proved that f(z) is a constant function, use the fundamental theorem of algebra to determine the value of the constant.",
    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a constant function, we will first show that f'(z) is a constant function using Liouville's theorem.\n\nConsider the function g(z) = f'(z)/z. Since f(z) is entire, f'(z) is also entire. Moreover, g(z) is analytic everywhere except at z = 0. We can find a value for g(0) using the limit:\n\nlim (z -> 0) g(z) = lim (z -> 0) (f'(z)/z)\n\nBy L'Hopital's rule, this limit is equal to:\n\nlim (z -> 0) (f''(z)/1) = f''(0)\n\nSince f''(z) is entire, the limit exists, and thus g(z) is entire.\n\nNow, we will use the given inequality to bound g(z). For all z in the complex plane, we have:\n\n|f(z)| ≤ 5|z|^2\n\nDivide both sides by |z|^3:\n\n|f(z)/z^3| ≤ 5|z|\n\nNow, we can use Cauchy's integral formula for the second derivative:\n\nf''(z) = (2!/(2πi)) ∮_C (f(ζ)/(ζ-z)^3) dζ\n\nTaking the absolute value of both sides and using the inequality we derived above:\n\n|f''(z)| ≤ (2!/(2π)) ∮_C (|f(ζ)/ζ^3| |ζ|^3 |dζ|) ≤ (2!/(2π)) ∮_C (5|ζ| |dζ|)\n\nNow, let R be a large positive number and let C be the circle with radius R centered at z. Then:\n\n|f''(z)| ≤ (2!/(2π)) (5R) ∮_C |dζ| = 5R(2πR)\n\nAs R goes to infinity, the right-hand side goes to 0, so we have:\n\n|f''(z)| = 0\n\nThis implies that f''(z) is identically 0. Thus, f'(z) is a constant function.\n\nNow, we can apply Liouville's theorem to f'(z). Since f'(z) is entire and bounded (it's a constant), Liouville's theorem states that f'(z) must be a constant function. Therefore, f(z) is a polynomial of degree 1 or less.\n\nFinally, we use the fundamental theorem of algebra. If f(z) were a non-constant polynomial, it would have at least one root. However, the given inequality implies that f(0) = 0, which means f(z) has a root at z = 0. Since f(z) is a polynomial of degree 1 or less and has a root at z = 0, it must be a constant function.\n\nThus, f(z) is a constant function, and its value is determined by the value of f(0), which is 0. Therefore, f(z) = 0 for all z in the complex plane."
