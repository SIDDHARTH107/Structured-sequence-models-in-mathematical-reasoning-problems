    "message_2": "There are five non-abelian groups of order 24, which are as follows:\n\n1. S_4: The symmetric group on 4 elements. It consists of all the permutations of 4 elements, and has 24 elements in total.\n\n2. A_4: The alternating group on 4 elements. It consists of all the even permutations of 4 elements, and has 12 elements in total. A_4 is a normal subgroup of S_4.\n\n3. D_12: The dihedral group of order 12. It is the group of symmetries of a regular dodecagon, including rotations and reflections. D_12 has 24 elements in total.\n\n4. Q_8 тип Z_3: The direct product of the quaternion group Q_8 and the cyclic group Z_3. Q_8 is a non-abelian group of order 8, and Z_3 is a cyclic group of order 3. The direct product of these two groups has 24 elements in total.\n\n5. SL(2,3): The special linear group of 2x2 matrices with determinant 1 over the finite field with 3 elements. This group has 24 elements in total.\n\nNow, let's discuss the isomorphisms between these groups and the cyclic group C24 and the alternating group A5.\n\nC24 is a cyclic group of order 24, which means it has a single generator and all its elements can be expressed as powers of that generator. Since C24 is abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to any of the non-abelian groups listed above.\n\nA5 is the alternating group on 5 elements, which has 60 elements in total. Since the order of A5 is different from the order of the non-abelian groups of order 24, there cannot be any isomorphisms between A5 and these groups.\n\nAs for the isomorphisms between the non-abelian groups of order 24 themselves, there are no isomorphisms between them, as they have different structures and properties. For example, S_4 has A_4 as a normal subgroup, while D_12 does not have a normal subgroup of order 12. Similarly, Q_8 тип Z_3 has a normal subgroup of order 8, while SL(2,3) does not. These differences in structure and properties prevent the groups from being isomorphic to each other."
