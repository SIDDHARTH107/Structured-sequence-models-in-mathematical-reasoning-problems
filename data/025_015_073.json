    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1, 0, 0), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - 1. Then, the gradient of F is given by:\n\n∇F = (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z)\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = -2z\n\nAt the point (1, 0, 0), the gradient is:\n\n∇F(1, 0, 0) = (2, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we can use the gradient as the normal vector to the tangent plane. The equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector, and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point (1, 0, 0). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n2(x - 1) + 0(y - 0) + 0(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get the equation of the tangent plane:\n\n2x - 2 = 0\n\nor\n\nx = 1"
