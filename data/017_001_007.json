    "message_2": "To show that a group G of order 4 is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will first find the possible Cayley tables for G. Since G has 4 elements, let's denote them as e, a, b, and c, where e is the identity element.\n\nThe first row and first column of the Cayley table must have the identity element e, and the rest of the elements in the first row and first column must be the other elements of the group (a, b, and c) in some order.\n\nCayley table for G:\n\n|   | e | a | b | c |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b | c |\n| a | a |   |   |   |\n| b | b |   |   |   |\n| c | c |   |   |   |\n\nNow, let's fill in the rest of the table using the group operation. Since the group operation is associative, we only need to ensure that each row and column contains all elements of the group exactly once.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to C4 (cyclic group of order 4)\n\nIn this case, the group operation is such that a^2 = b, a^3 = c, and a^4 = e. Therefore, we can fill in the Cayley table as follows:\n\n|   | e | a | b | c |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b | c |\n| a | a | b | c | e |\n| b | b | c | e | a |\n| c | c | e | a | b |\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to V4 (Klein four-group)\n\nIn this case, the group operation is such that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e, and ab = c, ba = c, ac = b, ca = b, bc = a, and cb = a. We can fill in the Cayley table as follows:\n\n|   | e | a | b | c |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b | c |\n| a | a | e | c | b |\n| b | b | c | e | a |\n| c | c | b | a | e |\n\nThese are the only two possible Cayley tables for a group of order 4 that satisfy the group axioms. Therefore, any group G of order 4 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
