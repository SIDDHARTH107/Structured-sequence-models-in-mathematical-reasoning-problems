    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces 5000 pieces of a certain product each day. They observed that the average number of defective products produced daily is 100. Using causal logic, determine the percentage of defective products produced by the company each day.",
    "message_2": "To determine the percentage of defective products produced by the company each day, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage of defective products = (Number of defective products / Total number of products) * 100\n\nIn this case, the number of defective products is 100, and the total number of products is 5000. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPercentage of defective products = (100 / 5000) * 100\n\nPercentage of defective products = 0.02 * 100\n\nPercentage of defective products = 2%\n\nSo, the company produces 2% defective products each day."
