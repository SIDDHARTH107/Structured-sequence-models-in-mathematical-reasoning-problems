    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of the team winning k games out of n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of winning a game)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the total number of games)\n- k is the number of successful trials (in this case, the number of games won)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 8 (total number of games)\n- k = 5 (number of games won)\n- p = 0.6 (historical probability of winning a game)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k), which is the number of combinations of 8 items taken 5 at a time:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!3!)\nC(8, 5) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\nC(8, 5) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1)\nC(8, 5) = 56\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(8, 5) * 0.6^5 * (1-0.6)^(8-5)\nP(X = 5) = 56 * 0.6^5 * 0.4^3\nP(X = 5) ≈ 56 * 0.07776 * 0.064\nP(X = 5) ≈ 0.2623\n\nSo, the probability of the football team winning 5 out of 8 games is approximately 26.23%."
