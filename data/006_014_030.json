    "message_1": "A system has 5 critical components and the probability of each component failing independently is 0.02. Find the probability that exactly 3 of the components fail simultaneously.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that exactly 3 of the 5 components fail simultaneously, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k components failing\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of components (5 in this case)\n- k is the number of components that fail (3 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a single component failing (0.02 in this case)\n\nFirst, let's find C(5, 3):\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.02^3 * (1-0.02)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.02^3 * 0.98^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.000008 * 0.9604\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.00007688\n\nSo the probability that exactly 3 of the 5 components fail simultaneously is approximately 0.00007688 or 0.007688%."
