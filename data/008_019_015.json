    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. The given system of equations is:\n\n(1) 2x + 5y + 3iz = 8i\n(2) x - 3y + 2z = 1\n(3) -4x + 2y + 5iz = -5\n\nFirst, we will write the augmented matrix for this system:\n\n|  2   5   3i |  8i |\n|  1  -3   2  |  1  |\n| -4   2   5i | -5  |\n\nNext, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We will start by making the first element of the second row 0. To do this, we can subtract half of the first row from the second row:\n\n|  2   5   3i |  8i |\n|  0  -5.5 -1i | -3i |\n| -4   2   5i | -5  |\n\nNow, we will make the first element of the third row 0. To do this, we can add twice the first row to the third row:\n\n|  2   5   3i |  8i  |\n|  0  -5.5 -1i | -3i  |\n|  0   12  11i | 11i  |\n\nNext, we will make the second element of the third row 0. To do this, we can add (12/5.5) times the second row to the third row:\n\n|  2   5    3i  |  8i  |\n|  0  -5.5 -1i  | -3i  |\n|  0   0   10.8i|  6i  |\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can now solve for the variables using back-substitution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n10.8i * z = 6i\n\nDividing both sides by 10.8i, we get:\n\nz = 6i / 10.8i = 6/10.8 = 1/1.8 = 5/9\n\nNow, we can substitute z back into the second row to find y:\n\n-5.5y - 1i(5/9) = -3i\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\n\n5.5y + (5i/9) = 3i\n\nSubtracting 5i/9 from both sides, we get:\n\n5.5y = 3i - 5i/9 = (22i - 5i) / 9 = 17i/9\n\nDividing both sides by 5.5, we get:\n\ny = (17i/9) / 5.5 = 17i / 49.5 = 17i / (99/2) = 34i / 99\n\nFinally, we can substitute y and z back into the first row to find x:\n\n2x + 5(34i/99) + 3i(5/9) = 8i\n\nMultiplying both sides by 99, we get:\n\n198x + 5(34i) + 3i(55) = 792i\n\n198x + 170i + 165i = 792i\n\n198x = 792i - 335i = 457i\n\nDividing both sides by 198, we get:\n\nx = 457i / 198\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 457i / 198\ny = 34i / 99\nz = 5/9"
