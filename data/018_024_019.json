    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. We need to know the universal set to find the complement. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {1, 3, 5, 6, 8} = {2, 4, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complement of A and B.\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {2, 4, 6, 8} = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\n(A' ∆ B') = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B')\n\nA' ∪ B' = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nA' ∩ B' = {7, 9, 10}\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's compare (A ∆ B)' and A' ∆ B':\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {2, 4, 7, 9, 10}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nSince (A ∆ B)' ≠ A' ∆ B', we have shown that the symmetric difference of the complement of A and B is not equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B."
