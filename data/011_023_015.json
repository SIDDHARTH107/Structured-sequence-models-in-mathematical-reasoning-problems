    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors required to properly color the vertices of a simple undirected graph with 7 vertices depends on the structure of the graph. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the graph would require 7 colors, as each vertex would be adjacent to all other vertices.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not complete, the minimum number of colors required can be less than 7. The minimum number of colors required for a graph is determined by its chromatic number. For a simple undirected graph with 7 vertices, the chromatic number can be as low as 2 if the graph is a bipartite graph (i.e., the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set).\n\nIn general, the minimum number of colors required to properly color the vertices of a simple undirected graph with 7 vertices can range from 2 to 7, depending on the structure of the graph."
