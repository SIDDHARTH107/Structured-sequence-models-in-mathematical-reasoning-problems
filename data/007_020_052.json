    "message_2": "To find the private key, d, for RSA encryption with primes p=7 and q=11, and public key e=17, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q = 7 * 11 = 77\n2. Compute the Euler's totient function, φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (7-1) * (11-1) = 6 * 10 = 60\n3. Find the modular inverse of e (17) with respect to φ(n) (60). In other words, find d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1.\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular inverse of e (17) with respect to φ(n) (60):\n\n17 * d ≡ 1 (mod 60)\n\nAfter solving for d, we get:\n\nd = 53\n\nSo, the private key, d, for RSA encryption with primes p=7 and q=11, and public key e=17 is 53."
