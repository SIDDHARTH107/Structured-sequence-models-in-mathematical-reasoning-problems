    "message_2": "To find the values of $\\lambda$ for which the solutions $\\psi(x)$ are square-integrable on the entire real line, we will analyze the behavior of the solutions at large values of $x$. \n\nConsider the asymptotic behavior of the Schrödinger equation as $x \\rightarrow \\pm\\infty$:\n\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} - x^2\\psi = -\\lambda\\psi$\n\nFor large values of $x$, the $x^2\\psi$ term dominates, and the equation becomes:\n\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} \\approx -x^2\\psi$\n\nThis equation has two linearly independent solutions, which can be expressed in terms of Airy functions:\n\n$\\psi(x) \\approx A \\cdot Ai(-x^2) + B \\cdot Bi(-x^2)$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. The Airy function $Ai(z)$ is well-behaved and decays exponentially as $z \\rightarrow \\infty$, while the Airy function $Bi(z)$ grows exponentially as $z \\rightarrow \\infty$. Therefore, to ensure that the solution is square-integrable, we must have $B = 0$:\n\n$\\psi(x) \\approx A \\cdot Ai(-x^2)$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $\\lambda$ for which this solution is valid. The Airy function $Ai(z)$ has an infinite number of zeros, denoted by $z_n$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer. Since we have:\n\n$-x^2 = z_n$\n\nWe can write:\n\n$x^2 = -z_n$\n\nThe corresponding values of $\\lambda$ are given by:\n\n$\\lambda_n = x^2 + z_n = -z_n + z_n = 0$\n\nTherefore, the only value of $\\lambda$ for which the solution is square-integrable on the entire real line is $\\lambda = 0$."
