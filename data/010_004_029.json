    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ B is compact, we need to show that every open cover of A ∪ B has a finite subcover. Let {U_i} be an open cover of A ∪ B. Since A and B are compact, there exist finite subcovers {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik} and {U_j1, U_j2, ..., U_jl} for A and B, respectively. \n\nNow, consider the subcover {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik, U_j1, U_j2, ..., U_jl}. This is a finite collection of open sets from the original open cover {U_i}, and it covers both A and B. Since A ∪ B is the union of A and B, this finite subcover also covers A ∪ B. \n\nTherefore, A ∪ B is compact, as every open cover of A ∪ B has a finite subcover."
