    "message_1": "A car manufacturing company claims that the average gas mileage of their new SUV model is 28 miles per gallon. To test their claim, a random sample of 30 SUVs was selected and their gas mileages were recorded. The average gas mileage for the sample was 26 miles per gallon with a standard deviation of 4.5 miles per gallon. \n\nAs a math student, can you determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05, we will perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 28 (The average gas mileage is 28 miles per gallon)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 28 (The average gas mileage is not 28 miles per gallon)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic.\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √sample size)\nt = (26 - 28) / (4.5 / √30)\nt = -2 / (4.5 / √30)\nt ≈ -2.98\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value and compare it to the test statistic.\nSince we are using a significance level of 0.05 and have a two-tailed test, we will use a t-distribution table to find the critical value for 29 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29). The critical value for a two-tailed test with 29 degrees of freedom and a 0.05 significance level is approximately ±2.045.\n\nStep 4: Make a decision based on the comparison.\nSince the test statistic (-2.98) is less than the critical value (-2.045), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is enough evidence to reject the company's claim that the average gas mileage of their new SUV model is 28 miles per gallon at a significance level of 0.05."
