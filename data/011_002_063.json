    "message_2": "To find the probability of choosing exactly 2 green balls, we will use the formula for combinations and probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n\nFirst, let's find the total possible outcomes when choosing 3 balls from the bag. There are 12 balls in total (6 red, 4 green, and 2 blue), so the total possible outcomes are the number of ways to choose 3 balls from 12:\n\nTotal possible outcomes = C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = 220\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes. We want to choose exactly 2 green balls and 1 ball of another color. There are 4 green balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 green balls is:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6\n\nThere are 8 balls that are not green (6 red and 2 blue), so the number of ways to choose 1 non-green ball is:\n\nC(8, 1) = 8! / (1! * (8-1)!) = 8! / (1! * 7!) = 8\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to choose 2 green balls and 1 non-green ball:\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes = 6 * 8 = 48\n\nFinally, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) = 48 / 220 = 12 / 55\n\nSo, the probability of choosing exactly 2 green balls and 1 non-green ball is 12/55."
