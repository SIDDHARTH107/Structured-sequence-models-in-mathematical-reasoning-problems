    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of A and B is empty, we need to show that there are no elements that belong to both A and B.\n\nLet A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} be the set containing even numbers from 2 to 10. The complement of A, denoted as B, contains all the elements that are not in A. In this case, B contains all the odd numbers from 1 to 9, since those are the numbers not included in A.\n\nB = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B. This set contains all the elements that are common to both A and B. Since A contains only even numbers and B contains only odd numbers, there are no common elements between A and B.\n\nTherefore, A ∩ B = ∅, which means the intersection of A and B is an empty set. This proves that the intersection of A and B is empty."
