Let A(x) be a predicate that means \"x is good at math\" and B(x) be a predicate that means \"x is good at science\". Express the following statement using quantifiers and logical connectives: \"There is a student in the class who is good at math and science.\"\n\nSolution: \n\n∃x ∈ U such that A(x) ∧ B(x)",
