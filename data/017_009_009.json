    "message_1": "Consider a group G of order 9. Let a be an element of G such that a is not equal to the identity element. If the order of a is not 9, then what is the order of a in G?",
    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 9, it means that there are 9 elements in G. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a finite group must divide the order of the group. In this case, the possible orders of elements in G are divisors of 9, which are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nSince a is not the identity element, its order cannot be 1. We are also given that the order of a is not 9. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the order of a in G is 3."
