    "message_1": "Suppose there is a factory that produces two types of products, let's say product A and product B. The production of product A takes 1 hour of machine time and generates a profit of $100 while the production of product B takes 2 hours of machine time and generates a profit of $150. The factory has only 200 hours of machine time available per week. Find the optimal production level of products A and B to maximize the profit of the factory. Use tabu search to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the best solution to a problem by exploring the solution space and avoiding previously visited solutions. In this case, we want to find the optimal production level of products A and B to maximize the profit of the factory.\n\nLet x be the number of product A produced and y be the number of product B produced. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 100x + 150y\n\nSubject to the constraint:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 200 (machine time constraint)\n\nWe will also have non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, let's apply the tabu search algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize a random starting solution, say (x=0, y=0), and set the tabu list size (e.g., 5).\n\n2. Generate a set of neighboring solutions by changing the values of x and y. For example, we can increment or decrement x and y by 1, ensuring that the constraints are still satisfied.\n\n3. Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution and select the best solution that is not in the tabu list.\n\n4. Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list size exceeds the specified limit.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a specified number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., no improvement in the best solution for a certain number of iterations).\n\nAfter performing the tabu search algorithm, we may find that the optimal solution is (x=100, y=50). This means that the factory should produce 100 units of product A and 50 units of product B to maximize the profit.\n\nThe maximum profit can be calculated as:\n\nProfit = 100 * 100 + 150 * 50 = 10,000 + 7,500 = $17,500\n\nSo, the optimal production level of products A and B to maximize the profit of the factory is 100 units of product A and 50 units of product B, with a total profit of $17,500."
