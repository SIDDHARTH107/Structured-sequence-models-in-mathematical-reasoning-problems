Determine the symmetric difference between (A ∆ B) and the complement of A, and compare it with the symmetric difference between (A' ∆ B') and the complement of A'. Show that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B:\n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A. Since no universal set is given, we will consider the union of A and B as the universal set:\n\nU = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA' = U - A = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A ∆ B) and A':\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A' = ({1, 4} - {2, 3, 4}) ∪ ({2, 3, 4} - {1, 4}) = {1} ∪ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the complement of B:\n\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = ({2, 3, 4} - {1, 2, 3}) ∪ ({1, 2, 3} - {2, 3, 4}) = {4} ∪ {1} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A':\n\nA'' = U - A' = {1, 2, 3}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference between (A' ∆ B') and A'':\n\n(A' ∆ B') ∆ A'' = ({1, 4} - {1, 2, 3}) ∪ ({1, 2, 3} - {1, 4}) = {4} ∪ {2, 3} = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, we can compare the two symmetric differences we found:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A' = {1, 2, 3}\n(A' ∆ B') ∆ A'' = {2, 3, 4}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∆ A' ≠ (A' ∆ B') ∆ A'', we can conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
