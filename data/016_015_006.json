    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in complexity with each order. To find the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 3, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal length = (length of one side of the square) * (4^(order) - 1) / 3\n\nIn this case, the length of one side of the square is 81 units, and the order is 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nTotal length = (81) * (4^3 - 1) / 3\nTotal length = (81) * (64 - 1) / 3\nTotal length = (81) * (63) / 3\nTotal length = 5103 / 3\nTotal length = 1701\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 3, which is constructed on a square of length 81 units, is 1701 units."
