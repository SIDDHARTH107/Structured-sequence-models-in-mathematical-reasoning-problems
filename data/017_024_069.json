    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order p^n * m, where p is a prime and (p, m) = 1, is congruent to 1 mod p and divides m.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Therefore, we need to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 (2^5) and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3 (3^1). In this case, the group is a direct product of the two Sylow subgroups, and we need to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32 and 3. There are 51 groups of order 32 and 1 group of order 3, so there are 51 possibilities in this case.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9 (3^2) and one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16 (2^4). In this case, the group is a direct product of the two Sylow subgroups, and we need to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 9 and 16. There are 2 groups of order 9 and 14 groups of order 16, so there are 28 possibilities in this case.\n\n2. Three Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3 (3^1) and one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 (2^5). In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the two Sylow subgroups, and we need to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32 and 3. There are 51 groups of order 32 and 1 group of order 3, so there are 51 possibilities in this case.\n\nAdding up the possibilities, we have a total of 51 + 28 + 51 = 130 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
