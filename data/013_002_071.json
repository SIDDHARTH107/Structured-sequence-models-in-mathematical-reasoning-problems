    "message_2": "First, let's check for pure strategy Nash Equilibria. A pure strategy Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\n1. If Player 1 chooses A and Player 2 chooses A, neither player has an incentive to deviate (2,2) is a Nash Equilibrium.\n2. If Player 1 chooses A and Player 2 chooses B, Player 1 would want to switch to B (0,3) is not a Nash Equilibrium.\n3. If Player 1 chooses B and Player 2 chooses A, Player 2 would want to switch to B (3,0) is not a Nash Equilibrium.\n4. If Player 1 chooses B and Player 2 chooses B, both players would want to switch to A (1,1) is not a Nash Equilibrium.\n\nNow, let's check for mixed strategy Nash Equilibria. A mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium occurs when players randomize their strategies and have no incentive to deviate from this randomization.\n\nLet p be the probability that Player 1 chooses A and (1-p) be the probability that Player 1 chooses B. Similarly, let q be the probability that Player 2 chooses A and (1-q) be the probability that Player 2 chooses B.\n\nPlayer 1's expected payoff for choosing A is 2q + 0(1-q) = 2q, and for choosing B is 3(1-q) + 1q = 3 - 2q. Player 1 will be indifferent between choosing A and B if the expected payoffs are equal:\n\n2q = 3 - 2q\n4q = 3\nq = 3/4\n\nPlayer 2's expected payoff for choosing A is 2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p, and for choosing B is 0p + 1(1-p) = 1 - p. Player 2 will be indifferent between choosing A and B if the expected payoffs are equal:\n\n3 - p = 1 - p\np = 1/2\n\nThus, the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium is when Player 1 chooses A with probability 1/2 and B with probability 1/2, and Player 2 chooses A with probability 3/4 and B with probability 1/4.\n\nIn summary, there are two Nash Equilibria for this game:\n1. Pure strategy Nash Equilibrium: (A, A) with payoffs (2,2)\n2. Mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium: Player 1 chooses A with probability 1/2 and B with probability 1/2, Player 2 chooses A with probability 3/4 and B with probability 1/4."
