    "message_2": "To graph the equation y = -2x + 3 on a coordinate plane, we can start by finding two points on the line and then connecting them.\n\n1. When x = 0:\ny = -2(0) + 3\ny = 3\nSo, the point (0, 3) is on the line.\n\n2. When x = 1:\ny = -2(1) + 3\ny = -2 + 3\ny = 1\nSo, the point (1, 1) is on the line.\n\nNow, plot these two points (0, 3) and (1, 1) on the coordinate plane and draw a straight line through them. This line represents the graph of the equation y = -2x + 3.\n\nTo find the y-coordinate of the point where the line intersects the y-axis, we can look at the point we found when x = 0. The y-axis is the vertical line where x = 0, so the point (0, 3) is the intersection point. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the point where the line intersects the y-axis is 3."
