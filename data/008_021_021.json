    "message_2": "A matrix of coefficients is singular if its determinant is zero, which means the system of linear equations has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. Let's first find the determinant of the matrix of coefficients:\n\nMatrix A:\n| 2  3  4 |\n| 4  6  8 |\n| 3  2  5 |\n\nDeterminant of A = 2(6*5 - 8*2) - 3(4*5 - 8*3) + 4(4*2 - 6*3)\n= 2(30 - 16) - 3(20 - 24) + 4(8 - 18)\n= 2(14) + 3(4) - 4(10)\n= 28 + 12 - 40\n= 0\n\nSince the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular. Now let's analyze the system of equations.\n\nNotice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (multiplied by 2). This means that these two equations are dependent and represent the same line in 3D space.\n\nNow let's check if the third equation is also dependent on the first one. We can do this by checking if there is a constant multiplier between the coefficients of the first and third equations:\n\n2x = 3x (multiplier: 3/2)\n3y = 2y (multiplier: 2/3)\n4z = 5z (multiplier: 5/4)\n\nSince the multipliers are not the same for all coefficients, the third equation is not dependent on the first one. This means that the system of equations has no unique solution.\n\nHowever, we can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's express z in terms of x and y using the first equation:\n\n4z = 10 - 2x - 3y\nz = (10 - 2x - 3y) / 4\n\nNow we have z in terms of x and y, but since the system has no unique solution, we cannot find specific values for x, y, and z that satisfy all three equations."
