    "message_2": "To find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 3, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(3) ± √((3)²-4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-3 ± √(9-8)) / 2\n\nx = (-3 ± √1) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (-3 + 1) / 2 = -2 / 2 = -1\n2) x = (-3 - 1) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2\n\nSo, the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0 are x = -1 and x = -2."
