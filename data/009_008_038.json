    "message_2": "To find the displacement of the string at x = 1 meter and t = 0.5 seconds, we first need to determine the wave equation that describes the motion of the wave along the string. The general form of the wave equation is:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase constant.\n\nGiven the displacement of the string at x = 0 and t = 0 is y = 3 sin(2πx/2), we can determine the amplitude and wave number:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 3\nWave number (k) = 2π/λ = 2π/2 = π\n\nNow we need to find the angular frequency (ω). We can use the wave speed (v) and the wavelength (λ) to find it:\n\nv = ω/ k\nω = v * k = 10 * π = 10π\n\nSince the displacement is given at x = 0 and t = 0, the phase constant (φ) is 0.\n\nNow we have the complete wave equation:\n\ny(x, t) = 3 sin(πx - 10πt)\n\nTo find the displacement at x = 1 meter and t = 0.5 seconds, plug in the values:\n\ny(1, 0.5) = 3 sin(π(1) - 10π(0.5))\ny(1, 0.5) = 3 sin(π - 5π)\ny(1, 0.5) = 3 sin(-4π)\n\nSince sin(-4π) = 0, the displacement of the string at x = 1 meter and t = 0.5 seconds is:\n\ny(1, 0.5) = 3 * 0 = 0"
