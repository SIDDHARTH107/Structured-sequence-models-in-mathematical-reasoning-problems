    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) with respect to t, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function f(g(x)), then the derivative of f with respect to x is given by:\n\nf'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nIn our case, we have f(x) = (x^4 + 4x^2)^(3/2) and x = tan(t). We want to find the derivative of f with respect to t, so we will first find the derivatives of f(x) with respect to x and x(t) with respect to t.\n\n1. Derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\nf'(x) = d/dx [(x^4 + 4x^2)^(3/2)]\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\nf'(x) = (3/2)(x^4 + 4x^2)^(1/2) * d/dx (x^4 + 4x^2)\nNow, we find the derivative of (x^4 + 4x^2) with respect to x:\nd/dx (x^4 + 4x^2) = 4x^3 + 8x\nSo, f'(x) = (3/2)(x^4 + 4x^2)^(1/2) * (4x^3 + 8x)\n\n2. Derivative of x(t) with respect to t:\nx(t) = tan(t)\nx'(t) = d/dt [tan(t)]\nUsing the derivative of the tangent function, we get:\nx'(t) = sec^2(t)\n\nNow, we will use the chain rule to find the derivative of f with respect to t:\nf'(t) = f'(x(t)) * x'(t)\nf'(t) = (3/2)(tan^4(t) + 4tan^2(t))^(1/2) * (4tan^3(t) + 8tan(t)) * sec^2(t)\n\nFinally, we will find the value of f'(π/4):\nf'(π/4) = (3/2)(tan^4(π/4) + 4tan^2(π/4))^(1/2) * (4tan^3(π/4) + 8tan(π/4)) * sec^2(π/4)\n\nSince tan(π/4) = 1 and sec(π/4) = √2, we have:\nf'(π/4) = (3/2)(1^4 + 4*1^2)^(1/2) * (4*1^3 + 8*1) * (√2)^2\nf'(π/4) = (3/2)(1 + 4)^(1/2) * (4 + 8) * 2\nf'(π/4) = (3/2)(5)^(1/2) * 12 * 2\nf'(π/4) = 3√5 * 24\n\nSo, the value of f'(π/4) is 72√5."
