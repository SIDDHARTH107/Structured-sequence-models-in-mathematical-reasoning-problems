Find the optimal control u(t) over the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 10, that minimizes the cost function J = ∫(y² + u²)dt, with initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0, and final conditions y(10) = 0 and y'(10) = 0.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control u(t) that minimizes the cost function J, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function H as follows:\n\nH(y, y', u, λ, λ') = y² + u² + λ(y'' + 4y' + 4y - u)\n\nwhere λ is the costate variable, and λ' is its derivative with respect to time.\n\nAccording to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control u(t) should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. ∂H/∂u = 0\n2. λ' = -∂H/∂y\n3. λ'(t) = -∂H/∂y'\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian function:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u - λ = 0  => u = λ/2\n\n∂H/∂y = 2y + 4λ = 0\n\n∂H/∂y' = 4λ' + 4λ = 0\n\nNow, we have the following system of differential equations:\n\n1. y'' + 4y' + 4y = λ/2\n2. λ' = -2y - 4λ\n3. λ'' = -4λ' - 4λ\n\nWe can solve this system of differential equations using the given initial and final conditions:\n\ny(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0, y(10) = 0, y'(10) = 0\n\nSolving this system of differential equations is quite involved and requires advanced techniques like the Laplace transform or numerical methods. However, once we find the solution for λ(t), we can find the optimal control u(t) as follows:\n\nu(t) = λ(t)/2\n\nThis optimal control u(t) will minimize the cost function J over the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 10."
