    "message_2": "To compute $\\dim\\mathcal{L}(D)$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem, which states that for any divisor $D$ on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the linear system of divisors linearly equivalent to $D$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nIn our case, we have a smooth projective plane curve $C$ of degree $d = 4$ and genus $g = 3$. The canonical divisor $K_C$ of a plane curve of degree $d$ is given by $K_C = (d-3)H$, where $H$ is the class of a line in the plane. In our case, $K_C = (4-3)H = H$.\n\nNow, we have a divisor $D$ on $C$ of degree $4$. We want to compute $\\dim\\mathcal{L}(D) = l(D)$. Using the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nSince $K_C = H$, we have $K_C - D = H - 4H = -3H$. Now, we need to compute $l(K_C - D) = l(-3H)$. Since $-3H$ is a negative divisor, we have $l(-3H) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting the values into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\n$l(D) - 0 = 4 + 1 - 3$\n\n$l(D) = 2$\n\nThus, the dimension of the linear system of divisors that are linearly equivalent to $D$ is $\\dim\\mathcal{L}(D) = l(D) = 2$."
