    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Since we have a right triangle with a 30-degree angle, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30-degree angle (the shorter leg) is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle (the longer leg) is the shorter leg multiplied by the square root of 3.\n\nLet's find the lengths of the other two sides:\n\nShorter leg (opposite 30-degree angle) = (1/2) * Hypotenuse\nShorter leg = (1/2) * 10 meters\nShorter leg = 5 meters\n\nLonger leg (opposite 60-degree angle) = Shorter leg * √3\nLonger leg = 5 meters * √3\nLonger leg ≈ 8.66 meters (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = Hypotenuse + Shorter leg + Longer leg\nPerimeter = 10 meters + 5 meters + 8.66 meters\nPerimeter ≈ 23.66 meters (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is approximately 23.66 meters."
