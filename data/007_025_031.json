She also selects her private key a = 5. Bob chooses his private key b = 3. Calculate the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use to encrypt their messages.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key (A) using the formula A = g^a mod p.\n2. Bob computes his public key (B) using the formula B = g^b mod p.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula S = B^a mod p.\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula S = A^b mod p.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. Alice's public key (A):\nA = g^a mod p = 2^5 mod 11 = 32 mod 11 = 10\n\n2. Bob's public key (B):\nB = g^b mod p = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\n\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys (A = 10 and B = 8).\n\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key (S):\nS = B^a mod p = 8^5 mod 11 = 32768 mod 11 = 3\n\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key (S):\nS = A^b mod p = 10^3 mod 11 = 1000 mod 11 = 3\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key, S = 3. They can now use this key to encrypt and decrypt their messages."
