    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using matrix methods, we'll first represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |, X = | x |, B = | 7 |\n    | 4 -5 |      | y |      | 2 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv) and multiply it by matrix B to find the matrix X.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A (det(A)):\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -5) - (2 * 4) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find the inverse of A (A_inv):\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nThe adjoint (adj(A)) of A is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors:\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -2 |\n         | -4  3 |\n\nNow, multiply adj(A) by (1/det(A)):\n\nA_inv = (1/-23) * | -5 -2 |\n                  | -4  3 |\n\nA_inv = | 5/23  2/23 |\n        | 4/23 -3/23 |\n\nNow, multiply A_inv by B to find X:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = | 5/23  2/23 | * | 7 |\n    | 4/23 -3/23 |   | 2 |\n\nX = | (5/23)*7 + (2/23)*2 |\n    | (4/23)*7 - (3/23)*2 |\n\nX = | 35/23 + 4/23 |\n    | 28/23 - 6/23 |\n\nX = | 39/23 |\n    | 22/23 |\n\nSo, the solution is x = 39/23 and y = 22/23."
