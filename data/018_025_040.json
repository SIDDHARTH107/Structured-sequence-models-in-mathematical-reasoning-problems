    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5}. Find (A Δ B) ∩ B and (B Δ A) ∩ B, where Δ represents the symmetric difference of two sets. Show that these two sets are not equal, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, which is denoted as B Δ A. \n\nB Δ A = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNotice that A Δ B = B Δ A, which means the symmetric difference is commutative. However, we are interested in proving whether the symmetric difference is commutative with respect to intersection.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A Δ B) with B, denoted as (A Δ B) ∩ B.\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ B = {5}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of (B Δ A) with B, denoted as (B Δ A) ∩ B.\n\n(B Δ A) ∩ B = {5}\n\nSince (A Δ B) ∩ B = {5} and (B Δ A) ∩ B = {5}, these two sets are equal. This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to intersection, contrary to the initial claim."
