    "message_1": "A population of rabbits on an island is growing according to the logistic equation: \n\ndy/dt = 0.5y(1 - y/100), \n\nwhere y is the rabbit population size and t represents time in months. \n\nIf the initial population was 20 rabbits, how many rabbits are expected to be present after 6 months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the logistic differential equation with the given initial condition y(0) = 20. The logistic equation is:\n\ndy/dt = 0.5y(1 - y/100)\n\nFirst, we separate the variables:\n\ndy/y(1 - y/100) = 0.5 dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y(1 - y/100)) dy = ∫(0.5) dt\n\nTo solve the left side integral, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let:\n\n1/y(1 - y/100) = A/y + B/(1 - y/100)\n\nMultiplying both sides by y(1 - y/100) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n1 = A(1 - y/100) + B(y)\n\nNow we can solve for A and B by choosing appropriate values for y:\n\nIf y = 0, then 1 = 1 * A => A = 1\nIf y = 100, then 1 = 100 * B => B = 1/100\n\nNow we can rewrite the left side integral as:\n\n∫(1/y + 1/100(1 - y/100)) dy = ∫(0.5) dt\n\nNow we integrate both sides:\n\nln|y| - ln|1 - y/100| = 0.5t + C\n\nUsing properties of logarithms, we can combine the left side:\n\nln|y/(1 - y/100)| = 0.5t + C\n\nNow we can exponentiate both sides to remove the logarithm:\n\ny/(1 - y/100) = e^(0.5t + C) = e^(0.5t) * e^C\n\nLet K = e^C, then:\n\ny/(1 - y/100) = Ke^(0.5t)\n\nNow we can use the initial condition y(0) = 20:\n\n20/(1 - 20/100) = K * e^(0.5 * 0)\n\nSolving for K:\n\n20/(80/100) = K * 1 => K = 20 * (100/80) => K = 25\n\nNow we have the particular solution:\n\ny/(1 - y/100) = 25e^(0.5t)\n\nWe want to find y(6), so we plug in t = 6:\n\ny/(1 - y/100) = 25e^(0.5 * 6)\n\nNow we can solve for y:\n\ny/(1 - y/100) = 25e^3\n\n1 - y/100 = y/(25e^3)\n\n100 - y = 4ye^3\n\n100 = y(1 + 4e^3)\n\ny = 100/(1 + 4e^3)\n\ny ≈ 47.45\n\nAfter 6 months, there are approximately 47 rabbits on the island."
