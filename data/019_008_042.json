    "message_1": "A student wants to score at least 80% in their upcoming exam. The exam has 10 questions, each with a maximum score of 10. Using fuzzy logic, determine the minimum number of questions the student needs to answer correctly to achieve their goal of scoring at least 80%. The grades for the exam are classified as follows: \n\n- Excellent: 90% to 100%\n- Good: 80% to 89.99%\n- Satisfactory: 70% to 79.99%\n- Unsatisfactory: less than 70%",
    "message_2": "To achieve a score of at least 80%, the student needs to score at least 80% of the total possible points. The total possible points for the exam are 10 questions * 10 points = 100 points. \n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of questions the student needs to answer correctly to achieve their goal. Using fuzzy logic, we can estimate the minimum number of questions needed to be answered correctly.\n\n80% of 100 points = 0.8 * 100 = 80 points\n\nSince each question is worth 10 points, we can divide the required points by the points per question:\n\n80 points / 10 points per question = 8 questions\n\nSo, the student needs to answer at least 8 questions correctly to achieve a score of at least 80% and fall into the \"Good\" grade classification."
