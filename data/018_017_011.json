    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products and symmetric differences for each of the given sets.\n\n1. (A × B) Δ B\nA × B = {(1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4), (5,2), (5,4)}\nB = {2, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A × B and B. Since B contains only single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty. Therefore, the symmetric difference is just the union of the two sets:\n\n(A × B) Δ B = {(1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4), (5,2), (5,4), 2, 4}\n\n2. A × (B Δ B)\nSince the symmetric difference of a set with itself is empty (B Δ B = ∅), the Cartesian product of A with an empty set is also empty:\n\nA × (B Δ B) = A × ∅ = ∅\n\n3. (A Δ B) × A\nFirst, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 3, 5, 2, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and A:\n\n(A Δ B) × A = {(1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (5,1), (5,3), (5,5), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (4,1), (4,3), (4,5)}\n\n4. A × (B × B) and (A × B) × B\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian product of B with itself:\n\nB × B = {(2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4)}\n\nNow, let's find A × (B × B):\n\nA × (B × B) = {(1,(2,2)), (1,(2,4)), (1,(4,2)), (1,(4,4)), (3,(2,2)), (3,(2,4)), (3,(4,2)), (3,(4,4)), (5,(2,2)), (5,(2,4)), (5,(4,2)), (5,(4,4))}\n\nNext, let's find (A × B) × B:\n\n(A × B) × B = {((1,2),2), ((1,2),4), ((1,4),2), ((1,4),4), ((3,2),2), ((3,2),4), ((3,4),2), ((3,4),4), ((5,2),2), ((5,2),4), ((5,4),2), ((5,4),4)}\n\nNow, let's analyze the results to determine whether the Cartesian product of two sets is associative with respect to symmetric difference.\n\nFrom the results above, we can see that the Cartesian products and symmetric differences do not follow the associative property. For example, (A × B) Δ B ≠ A × (B Δ B) and A × (B × B) ≠ (A × B) × B.\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
