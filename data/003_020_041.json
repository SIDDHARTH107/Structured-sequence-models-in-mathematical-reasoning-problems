    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall, and the angle formed between the ladder and the ground is 60 degrees. If the ladder is 12 meters long, how high does it reach on the wall?",
    "message_2": "To find the height the ladder reaches on the wall, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle (in this case, the height on the wall) to the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder's length).\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this problem, the angle is 60 degrees, and the ladder's length (hypotenuse) is 12 meters. We want to find the height on the wall (opposite side).\n\nsin(60) = height on the wall / 12\n\nThe sine of 60 degrees is equal to √3/2.\n\n(√3/2) = height on the wall / 12\n\nNow, we can solve for the height on the wall:\n\nheight on the wall = 12 * (√3/2)\n\nheight on the wall = 6√3\n\nThe ladder reaches a height of 6√3 meters on the wall."
