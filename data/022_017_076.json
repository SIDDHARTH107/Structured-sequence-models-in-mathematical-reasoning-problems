    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using complex analysis, we first rewrite the equation as a characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is given by:\n\n$$r^2 + 4 = 0$$\n\nNow, we solve for the roots of this equation. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$r^2 = -4$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$r = \\pm 2i$$\n\nNow, we have two complex roots, $r_1 = 2i$ and $r_2 = -2i$. According to the theory of linear differential equations with constant coefficients, the general solution of the given differential equation can be written as:\n\n$$y(x) = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x}$$\n\nSubstituting the roots, we get:\n\n$$y(x) = C_1 e^{2ix} + C_2 e^{-2ix}$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the complex exponentials in terms of trigonometric functions using Euler's formula:\n\n$$e^{ix} = \\cos{x} + i\\sin{x}$$\n\nSo, our solution becomes:\n\n$$y(x) = C_1 (\\cos{2x} + i\\sin{2x}) + C_2 (\\cos{-2x} + i\\sin{-2x})$$\n\nSince $\\cos{-x} = \\cos{x}$ and $\\sin{-x} = -\\sin{x}$, we can rewrite the solution as:\n\n$$y(x) = C_1 (\\cos{2x} + i\\sin{2x}) + C_2 (\\cos{2x} - i\\sin{2x})$$\n\nNow, we can group the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\n$$y(x) = (C_1 + C_2)\\cos{2x} + i(C_1 - C_2)\\sin{2x}$$\n\nSince the given differential equation is real, the imaginary part of the solution must be zero. Therefore, we can write the general solution as:\n\n$$y(x) = A\\cos{2x} + B\\sin{2x}$$\n\nwhere $A = C_1 + C_2$ and $B = i(C_1 - C_2)$ are real constants."
