    "message_1": "A company has collected data on the performance of their employees using different parameters such as age, experience, skill level, and productivity. They want to reduce the parameters to a smaller set of new variables that capture most of the information in the original data. Using principal component analysis, the company found that three principal components can explain 80% of the total variability in the data. If the original data had 10 parameters, how many parameters can the company reduce the data to and still capture 80% of the total variability?",
    "message_2": "The company can reduce the data to 3 parameters (the three principal components) and still capture 80% of the total variability."
