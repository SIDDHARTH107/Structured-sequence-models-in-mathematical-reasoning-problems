    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function y = 2sin(3x), we need to analyze the coefficients of the sine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the variable x inside the sine function. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of x. In this case, B = 3. So, the period is (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the function y = 2sin(3x) is 2, and the period is (2π) / 3 over the interval [0, 2π]."
