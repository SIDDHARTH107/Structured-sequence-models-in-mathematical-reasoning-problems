    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the population mean (μ) is 175 cm and the population standard deviation (σ) is 5 cm, we can find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σx̄) using the formula:\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n\n\nwhere n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, n = 50, so:\n\nσx̄ = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071 cm\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean height (x̄) is between 174 cm and 176 cm. To do this, we will use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σx̄\n\nFirst, we will find the z-scores for 174 cm and 176 cm:\n\nz₁ = (174 - 175) / 0.7071 ≈ -1.4142\nz₂ = (176 - 175) / 0.7071 ≈ 1.4142\n\nNow, we will use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. \n\nP(z₁) ≈ 0.0786\nP(z₂) ≈ 0.9214\n\nFinally, we will find the probability that the sample mean height is between 174 cm and 176 cm by subtracting the probabilities:\n\nP(174 < x̄ < 176) = P(z₂) - P(z₁) = 0.9214 - 0.0786 ≈ 0.8428\n\nSo, there is approximately an 84.28% probability that the sample mean height of 50 adult males from this city will be between 174 cm and 176 cm."
