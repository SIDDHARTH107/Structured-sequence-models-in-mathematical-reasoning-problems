    "message_1": "A company is trying to minimize the cost of manufacturing a particular product. The cost is a quadratic function of two variables: x and y. They have two constraints: x + y = 10 and x, y > 0. Find the values of x and y that minimize the cost if the function is given by f(x, y) = 3x^2 + 5xy + 4y^2 - 6x - 28y + 12.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost function f(x, y) = 3x^2 + 5xy + 4y^2 - 6x - 28y + 12 subject to the constraint x + y = 10 and x, y > 0, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the constraint equation as g(x, y) = x + y - 10 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of f(x, y) and g(x, y):\n\n∇f(x, y) = (df/dx, df/dy) = (6x + 5y - 6, 5x + 8y - 28)\n∇g(x, y) = (dg/dx, dg/dy) = (1, 1)\n\nAccording to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we need to find a scalar λ (lambda) such that:\n\n∇f(x, y) = λ∇g(x, y)\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n6x + 5y - 6 = λ\n5x + 8y - 28 = λ\n\nWe also have the constraint equation x + y = 10. Now we have a system of three equations with three unknowns (x, y, and λ):\n\n1) 6x + 5y - 6 = λ\n2) 5x + 8y - 28 = λ\n3) x + y = 10\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nFrom equation (3), we can express y in terms of x: y = 10 - x.\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into equations (1) and (2):\n\n1) 6x + 5(10 - x) - 6 = λ\n2) 5x + 8(10 - x) - 28 = λ\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n1) x + 44 = λ\n2) -3x + 52 = λ\n\nNow set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx + 44 = -3x + 52\n\nAdd 3x to both sides:\n\n4x = 8\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nx = 2\n\nNow substitute x back into the expression for y:\n\ny = 10 - x = 10 - 2 = 8\n\nSo the values of x and y that minimize the cost function are x = 2 and y = 8."
