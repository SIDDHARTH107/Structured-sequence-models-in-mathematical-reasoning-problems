    "message_1": "Suppose a company manufacturing electric bulbs wants to determine the relationship between the number of bulbs produced and the total cost incurred, with the production output measured in thousands of bulbs. From their data, they estimated the following regression equation: \n\nTotal cost = 100 + 2x \n\nWhere 'x' represents the number of thousands of bulbs produced and 'Total cost' represents the total cost incurred in thousands of dollars. \n\nCalculate the total cost incurred when the company produces 7,000 bulbs.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total cost incurred when the company produces 7,000 bulbs, we need to plug in the value of 'x' into the regression equation. In this case, x = 7 (since the production output is measured in thousands of bulbs).\n\nTotal cost = 100 + 2x\nTotal cost = 100 + 2(7)\n\nNow, we can solve the equation:\n\nTotal cost = 100 + 14\nTotal cost = 114\n\nSo, the total cost incurred when the company produces 7,000 bulbs is 114 thousand dollars."
