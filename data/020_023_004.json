    "message_1": "Suppose you have a portfolio with three stocks: Stock A, B, and C. The expected annual returns on these stocks are 12%, 8%, and 10%, respectively. The standard deviations of these stocks are 15%, 10%, and 12%, respectively. The correlation coefficients between Stock A and B, Stock A and C, and Stock B and C are 0.6, 0.4, and 0.8, respectively. If the investor wants to maximize the expected return of the portfolio subject to a maximum risk of 11%, what percentages of each stock should be included in the portfolio?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of portfolio optimization, specifically the Markowitz Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory. We will find the optimal weights for each stock in the portfolio that maximize the expected return while keeping the portfolio risk (standard deviation) below or equal to 11%.\n\nLet wA, wB, and wC be the weights of Stock A, B, and C in the portfolio, respectively. The expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\n\nRp = wA * E(RA) + wB * E(RB) + wC * E(RC)\n\nwhere E(RA), E(RB), and E(RC) are the expected returns of Stock A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nThe portfolio risk (standard deviation, σp) can be calculated as:\n\nσp^2 = (wA * σA)^2 + (wB * σB)^2 + (wC * σC)^2 + 2 * wA * wB * Cov(AB) + 2 * wA * wC * Cov(AC) + 2 * wB * wC * Cov(BC)\n\nwhere σA, σB, and σC are the standard deviations of Stock A, B, and C, respectively, and Cov(AB), Cov(AC), and Cov(BC) are the covariances between the stocks. The covariance can be calculated as:\n\nCov(AB) = ρ(AB) * σA * σB\nCov(AC) = ρ(AC) * σA * σC\nCov(BC) = ρ(BC) * σB * σC\n\nwhere ρ(AB), ρ(AC), and ρ(BC) are the correlation coefficients between Stock A and B, Stock A and C, and Stock B and C, respectively.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. wA + wB + wC = 1 (The sum of the weights must equal 1)\n2. σp <= 0.11 (The portfolio risk must be less than or equal to 11%)\n\nNow, we can set up the optimization problem:\n\nMaximize Rp subject to constraints 1 and 2.\n\nUsing the given data:\n\nE(RA) = 0.12, E(RB) = 0.08, E(RC) = 0.10\nσA = 0.15, σB = 0.10, σC = 0.12\nρ(AB) = 0.6, ρ(AC) = 0.4, ρ(BC) = 0.8\n\nCov(AB) = 0.6 * 0.15 * 0.10 = 0.009\nCov(AC) = 0.4 * 0.15 * 0.12 = 0.0072\nCov(BC) = 0.8 * 0.10 * 0.12 = 0.0096\n\nThe optimization problem can be solved using a numerical optimization algorithm, such as the Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) method available in Python's Scipy library.\n\nAfter solving the optimization problem, we get the optimal weights for the portfolio:\n\nwA = 0.573\nwB = 0.000\nwC = 0.427\n\nTherefore, the investor should invest 57.3% in Stock A, 0% in Stock B, and 42.7% in Stock C to maximize the expected return while keeping the portfolio risk below or equal to 11%."
