    "message_2": "To find the acceleration function, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time (t). The velocity function is given by v(t) = 3t^2 - 6t + 2.\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we have:\n\ndv/dt = d(3t^2 - 6t + 2)/dt = 6t - 6\n\nNow, the acceleration function a(t) is the derivative of the velocity function, so:\n\na(t) = 6t - 6\n\nTo find the acceleration of the car at t = 2 seconds, we simply plug t = 2 into the acceleration function:\n\na(2) = 6(2) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at t = 2 seconds is 6 meters per second squared."
