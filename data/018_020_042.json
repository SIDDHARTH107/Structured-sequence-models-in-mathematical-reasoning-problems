    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, and then find the union of the resulting set with set C = {2, 3, 6, 7}. Finally, find the symmetric difference of sets A and C, as well as the symmetric difference of sets B and C. Show that the symmetric difference of sets A and B is distributive over union by comparing the two results obtained.",

The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the resulting set with set C = {2, 3, 6, 7}.
