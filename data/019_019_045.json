    "message_2": "To prove that f(x) is not computable, we will use a proof by contradiction. We will assume that f(x) is computable and show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that f(x) is computable. Then, there exists a Turing machine M that computes f(x). Let's construct a new Turing machine M' that uses M as a subroutine. M' works as follows:\n\n1. On input (x, y), where x is the description of a Turing machine and y is an input for that machine, M' first computes f(x) using M. This gives the number of steps required for the Turing machine x to halt on input y.\n\n2. M' then simulates the Turing machine x on input y for f(x) steps. If x halts within f(x) steps, M' outputs the opposite of what x outputs. If x does not halt within f(x) steps, M' outputs 0.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we run M' on its own description, i.e., M'(M', M'). There are two cases:\n\n1. M' halts on input (M', M') and outputs 0. In this case, M' should have outputted the opposite of what it actually outputs, which is 1. This is a contradiction.\n\n2. M' halts on input (M', M') and outputs 1. In this case, M' should have outputted the opposite of what it actually outputs, which is 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nIn both cases, we have a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that f(x) is computable must be false. Hence, f(x) is not computable. This is known as the Halting Problem, which is a well-known example of an undecidable problem in computability theory."
