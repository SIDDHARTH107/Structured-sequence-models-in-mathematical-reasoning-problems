    "message_1": "Consider an auction with four bidders. Each bidder's value for the item being auctioned is independently and uniformly distributed over the interval [0, 100]. Using the second-price sealed-bid auction mechanism, what is the expected revenue of the auction organizer if the reserve price for the item is set at 50?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction and pays the second-highest bid. If the highest bid is below the reserve price, the auction is canceled, and no one wins the item.\n\nLet's first find the probability that the auction is successful, i.e., at least one bidder bids above the reserve price of 50. The probability that a single bidder bids below 50 is 50/100 = 1/2. Since the bids are independent, the probability that all four bidders bid below 50 is (1/2)^4 = 1/16. Therefore, the probability that at least one bidder bids above 50 is 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.\n\nNow, let's find the expected revenue conditional on the auction being successful. Let X1, X2, X3, and X4 be the bids of the four bidders. We are interested in the expected value of the second-highest bid among the bids above 50, given that at least one bid is above 50.\n\nLet Y be the second-highest bid among the bids above 50. We can find the expected value of Y by conditioning on the number of bids above 50.\n\nE(Y) = E(Y | 1 bid above 50) * P(1 bid above 50) + E(Y | 2 bids above 50) * P(2 bids above 50) + E(Y | 3 bids above 50) * P(3 bids above 50) + E(Y | 4 bids above 50) * P(4 bids above 50)\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\n1. E(Y | 1 bid above 50) = 50 (since the second-highest bid is the reserve price)\n   P(1 bid above 50) = C(4,1) * (1/2)^4 = 4 * 1/16 = 1/4\n\n2. E(Y | 2 bids above 50) = (50 + 100) / 2 = 75 (since the bids are uniformly distributed)\n   P(2 bids above 50) = C(4,2) * (1/2)^4 = 6 * 1/16 = 3/8\n\n3. E(Y | 3 bids above 50) = (50 + 100) / 2 = 75 (since the bids are uniformly distributed)\n   P(3 bids above 50) = C(4,3) * (1/2)^4 = 4 * 1/16 = 1/4\n\n4. E(Y | 4 bids above 50) = 50 (since the second-highest bid is the reserve price)\n   P(4 bids above 50) = (1/2)^4 = 1/16\n\nNow, we can calculate E(Y):\n\nE(Y) = 50 * 1/4 + 75 * 3/8 + 75 * 1/4 + 50 * 1/16 = 12.5 + 28.125 + 18.75 + 3.125 = 62.5\n\nFinally, the expected revenue of the auction organizer is the expected revenue conditional on the auction being successful, multiplied by the probability that the auction is successful:\n\nExpected revenue = E(Y) * P(at least one bid above 50) = 62.5 * 15/16 = (62.5 * 15) / 16 = 937.5 / 16 â‰ˆ 58.59\n\nSo, the expected revenue of the auction organizer with a reserve price of 50 is approximately 58.59."
