    "message_1": "A spherical water tank has a diameter of 10 meters. If it needs to be covered with paint at a rate of 5 square meters per liter, how many liters of paint are needed to cover the entire surface of the tank? Round your answer to the nearest liter.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the surface area of the spherical water tank. The formula for the surface area of a sphere is:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. Since the diameter of the tank is 10 meters, the radius is half of that, which is 5 meters.\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (5^2)\nSurface area = 4 * π * 25\nSurface area = 100π square meters\n\nNow, we need to determine how many liters of paint are needed to cover the entire surface of the tank. We are given that 1 liter of paint covers 5 square meters.\n\nNumber of liters = Surface area / Coverage per liter\nNumber of liters = (100π) / 5\nNumber of liters = 20π\n\nNow, we round the answer to the nearest liter:\n\nNumber of liters ≈ 20 * 3.14\nNumber of liters ≈ 62.8\n\nSo, approximately 63 liters of paint are needed to cover the entire surface of the tank."
