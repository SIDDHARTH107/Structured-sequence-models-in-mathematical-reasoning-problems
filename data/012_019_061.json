    "message_1": "Consider the following graph:\n\n```\nA---B\n|   |\nC---D\n```\n\nWhat is the chromatic index of this graph?",
    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In this case, we can color the edges of the graph as follows:\n\n```\n1\nA---B\n|   |\n2   3\nC---D\n  4\n```\n\nHere, no two adjacent edges share the same color, and we used 4 colors. Therefore, the chromatic index of this graph is 4."
