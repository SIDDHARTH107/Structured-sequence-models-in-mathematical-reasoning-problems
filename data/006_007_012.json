    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain stock price increase by 10% is 0.65 and the probability of a decrease by 8% is 0.35. If the current stock price is $100, what is the expected value of the new stock price after the next trading day?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the new stock price, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then add them together.\n\nIf the stock price increases by 10%, the new price will be:\n$100 * 1.10 = $110\n\nIf the stock price decreases by 8%, the new price will be:\n$100 * 0.92 = $92\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value:\nExpected value = (probability of increase * value of increase) + (probability of decrease * value of decrease)\n\nExpected value = (0.65 * $110) + (0.35 * $92)\nExpected value = $71.5 + $32.2\nExpected value = $103.7\n\nSo, the expected value of the new stock price after the next trading day is $103.7."
