    "message_2": "It seems there is a misunderstanding in the question, as the sets (A x B) ∪ (B x A) and (B x A) ∪ (A x B) are actually equal. Let's find the sets and show that they are equal.\n\nA x B represents the Cartesian product of sets A and B, which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. Similarly, B x A consists of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow let's find the union of these sets:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\n(B x A) ∪ (A x B) = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nAs you can see, both sets contain the same elements, so:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = (B x A) ∪ (A x B)\n\nThus, the two sets are equal, not different as the question suggests."
