    "message_2": "In linear logic notation, we can represent the given statements as follows:\n\n- Alice has 3 apples: 1A ⊗ 1A ⊗ 1A (using the multiplicative connective ⊗ to represent each apple)\n- Bob has 5 apples: 1B ⊗ 1B ⊗ 1B ⊗ 1B ⊗ 1B\n- Charlie has 2 apples: 1C ⊗ 1C\n\nNow, to express the total number of apples, we can use the additive connective ⊕:\n\nTotal number of apples = (1A ⊗ 1A ⊗ 1A) ⊕ (1B ⊗ 1B ⊗ 1B ⊗ 1B ⊗ 1B) ⊕ (1C ⊗ 1C)\n\nThis represents the sum of apples that Alice, Bob, and Charlie have, using linear logic notation with additive and multiplicative connectives."
