    "message_1": "A kite is flying at a height of 60 meters above ground level. An observer is standing on the ground and looking at the kite. If the angle of elevation of the kite is 45 degrees, find the distance of the kite from the observer.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance of the kite from the observer, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the kite) and the adjacent side (distance from the observer).\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the height of the kite is 60 meters. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(45) = 60 / distance\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1, the equation becomes:\n\n1 = 60 / distance\n\nTo solve for the distance, we can multiply both sides by the distance and then divide by 1:\n\ndistance = 60 / 1\ndistance = 60 meters\n\nSo, the distance of the kite from the observer is 60 meters."
