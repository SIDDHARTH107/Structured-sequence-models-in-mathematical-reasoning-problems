    "message_2": "To find the nature of the singularity of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - 1) at z = 1, we first simplify the function by factoring the numerator:\n\nf(z) = ((z - 1)(z + 1))/(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor (z - 1) from the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(z) = z + 1\n\nSince the function is now a simple linear function, there is no singularity at z = 1. The original singularity was a removable singularity, as it was \"removed\" by simplifying the function."
