    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph:\n\n```\n    A --- B --- C\n    |     |     |\n    D --- E --- F\n```\n\nCut vertices: B and E\nExplanation: If we remove vertex B along with its incident edges, the graph will be split into two connected components: {A, D, E} and {C, F}. Similarly, if we remove vertex E along with its incident edges, the graph will be split into two connected components: {A, B, C} and {D, F}.\n\nBridges: None\nExplanation: There are no edges in the graph that, when removed, would increase the number of connected components. Each edge has an alternative path connecting its two vertices. For example, if we remove edge AB, vertices A and B are still connected through the path A-D-E-B."
