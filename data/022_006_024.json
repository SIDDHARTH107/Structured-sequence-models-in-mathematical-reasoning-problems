    "message_2": "The maximum modulus principle states that if a function is holomorphic (i.e., complex differentiable) in a bounded domain and continuous on its boundary, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2 is a polynomial and thus holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, we can apply the maximum modulus principle to find the maximum value of |f(z)| on the closed disk |z| <= 2.\n\nLet z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then, we can write f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (x + yi)^2 - 2(x + yi) + 2\n     = (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2) + (2xy - 2y)i\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of |f(z)| on the boundary of the disk, i.e., when |z| = 2. We can parameterize the boundary of the disk using polar coordinates:\n\nz = 2 * e^(iθ), where θ is in the range [0, 2π].\n\nNow, let's compute f(z) for z = 2 * e^(iθ):\n\nf(2 * e^(iθ)) = (2 * e^(iθ))^2 - 2(2 * e^(iθ)) + 2\n              = 4 * e^(2iθ) - 4 * e^(iθ) + 2\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of |f(2 * e^(iθ))|. To do this, we can use the polar form of complex numbers:\n\n|f(2 * e^(iθ))| = |4 * e^(2iθ) - 4 * e^(iθ) + 2|\n\nLet's consider the function g(θ) = |4 * e^(2iθ) - 4 * e^(iθ) + 2|. We want to find the maximum value of g(θ) for θ in the range [0, 2π].\n\nTo find the maximum value of g(θ), we can compute its derivative with respect to θ and find the critical points:\n\ng'(θ) = d/dθ (|4 * e^(2iθ) - 4 * e^(iθ) + 2|)\n\nHowever, finding the derivative of the modulus of a complex function can be quite difficult. Instead, we can use a geometric interpretation to find the maximum value of g(θ).\n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2 can be rewritten as:\n\nf(z) = (z - 1)^2 + 1\n\nNow, consider the transformation z ↦ z - 1. This transformation shifts the origin of the complex plane to the point 1 + 0i. In this transformed plane, the function f(z) becomes:\n\nf(z) = z^2 + 1\n\nNow, the maximum value of |f(z)| on the closed disk |z| <= 2 in the transformed plane corresponds to the maximum value of |z^2 + 1| on the closed disk |z - 1| <= 2.\n\nIn the transformed plane, the closed disk |z - 1| <= 2 is centered at 1 + 0i with radius 2. The maximum value of |z^2 + 1| is attained when z is at the point furthest from the origin, which is the point -1 + 0i (the opposite side of the circle).\n\nSo, in the transformed plane, the maximum value of |f(z)| is:\n\n|max(f(z))| = |(-1)^2 + 1|\n            = |1 + 1|\n            = 2\n\nThus, the maximum value of |f(z)| on the closed disk |z| <= 2 is 2."
