    "message_1": "A math student is asked to use the Fourier transform to find the solution of the following differential equation:\n\ny'' + 2y' + 5y = 6e^(-t) \n\nSubject to the following initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 1, y'(0) = 2\n\nThe student should determine the solution of the differential equation using the Fourier transform and provide a plot of the real and imaginary parts of the solution as a function of time.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transforms of the given equation and the initial conditions.\n\nLet Y(w) be the Fourier transform of y(t), and let F{.} denote the Fourier transform operator. Applying the Fourier transform to the given differential equation, we get:\n\nF{y'' + 2y' + 5y} = F{6e^(-t)}\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we have:\n\n(w^2Y(w) - wy(0) - y'(0)) + 2(wY(w) - y(0)) + 5Y(w) = 6/(w + 1)\n\nNow, we can substitute the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 2:\n\n(w^2Y(w) - w - 2) + 2(wY(w) - 1) + 5Y(w) = 6/(w + 1)\n\nRearranging the terms and solving for Y(w), we get:\n\nY(w) = (6/(w + 1) + w + 2 + 2)/(w^2 + 2w + 5)\n\nY(w) = (8 + 3w)/(w^2 + 2w + 5)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(w) to get y(t). The inverse Fourier transform of Y(w) is given by:\n\ny(t) = F^{-1}{Y(w)}\n\ny(t) = F^{-1}{(8 + 3w)/(w^2 + 2w + 5)}\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier transform, we can use the method of complex integration (contour integration) or look up standard Fourier transform pairs. The inverse Fourier transform of Y(w) is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-t)(2cos(2t) + sin(2t))\n\nNow, we can plot the real and imaginary parts of the solution as a function of time. However, since the solution is entirely real, the imaginary part is zero. The real part of the solution is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-t)(2cos(2t) + sin(2t))\n\nPlotting this function, we can observe the behavior of the solution over time. The function starts at y(0) = 1 and has an initial slope of y'(0) = 2, as given by the initial conditions. The solution then oscillates and decays exponentially as time increases."
