    "message_1": "Suppose a population of rabbits is growing at a rate proportional to the current population size with a growth rate of 0.03 per month. If the initial population size was 200 rabbits, find the function that models the population growth and estimate the rabbit population after 3 years.",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth, we can use the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(rt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in months.\n\nIn this case, P0 = 200 rabbits, r = 0.03 per month, and we want to find the population after 3 years, which is 3 * 12 = 36 months.\n\nSo, the function that models the population growth is:\n\nP(t) = 200 * e^(0.03t)\n\nNow, we can estimate the rabbit population after 3 years (36 months) by plugging t = 36 into the function:\n\nP(36) = 200 * e^(0.03 * 36)\nP(36) ≈ 200 * e^(1.08)\nP(36) ≈ 200 * 2.944\nP(36) ≈ 589.76\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the estimated rabbit population after 3 years is approximately 590 rabbits."
