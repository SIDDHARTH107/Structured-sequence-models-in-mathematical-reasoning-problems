The company wants to know how many possible combinations of teams can be formed, assuming each team must consist of at least 2 employees but no more than 4 employees. Using Bell numbers, how many combinations of teams are possible?",
    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. However, in this case, we have a constraint on the size of the subsets (teams), which makes it unsuitable to use Bell numbers directly.\n\nInstead, we can use combinations to solve this problem. There are 7 employees, and we want to form teams of 2, 3, or 4 employees. We can calculate the number of combinations for each team size and then add them together.\n\nFor teams of 2 employees:\nC(7,2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 21\n\nFor teams of 3 employees:\nC(7,3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = 35\n\nFor teams of 4 employees:\nC(7,4) = 7! / (4! * (7-4)!) = 35\n\nNow, we add the number of combinations for each team size together:\n21 + 35 + 35 = 91\n\nSo there are 91 possible combinations of teams that can be formed with 7 employees, with each team consisting of at least 2 employees but no more than 4 employees."
