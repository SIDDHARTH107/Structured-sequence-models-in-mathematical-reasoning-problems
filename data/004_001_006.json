    "message_2": "First, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x + 10 with respect to x. \n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3)/dx + d(4x^2)/dx - d(6x)/dx + d(10)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 8x - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2)^2 + 8(2) - 6\n\nf'(2) = 6(4) + 16 - 6\n\nf'(2) = 24 + 16 - 6\n\nf'(2) = 34\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x + 10 at the point x = 2 is 34."
