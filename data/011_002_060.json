    "message_2": "To find the number of different committees that can be formed, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (8 in this case) and k is the number of employees to choose (3 in this case).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1)\n\nC(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, the company can form 56 different committees from the 8 employees."
