    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(s) of f(t), we use the following formula:\n\nF(s) = ∫[-∞,∞] f(t) * e^(-2πist) dt\n\nSince f(t) is defined only on the interval [-1, 1], the integral becomes:\n\nF(s) = ∫[-1,1] t(1-t) * e^(-2πist) dt\n\nNow, we can solve this integral by using integration by parts twice. Let's set:\n\nu = t(1-t)\ndv = e^(-2πist) dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = (1 - 2t) dt\nv = (-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist)\n\nNow, apply integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = uv |[-1,1] - ∫[-1,1] v du\nF(s) = (-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist) * t(1-t) |[-1,1] + (1/(2πis)) * ∫[-1,1] (1 - 2t) * e^(-2πist) dt\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts again on the new integral:\n\nu = 1 - 2t\ndv = e^(-2πist) dt\n\ndu = -2 dt\nv = (-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist)\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nF(s) = (-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist) * t(1-t) |[-1,1] + (1/(2πis)) * ((-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist) * (1 - 2t) |[-1,1] - ∫[-1,1] (-1/(2πis)) * (-2) * e^(-2πist) dt)\n\nNow, we can simplify and solve the remaining integral:\n\nF(s) = (-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist) * t(1-t) |[-1,1] + (1/(2πis)) * ((-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist) * (1 - 2t) |[-1,1] + (1/(πis)) * ∫[-1,1] e^(-2πist) dt)\n\nThe last integral can be solved directly:\n\n∫[-1,1] e^(-2πist) dt = (-1/(2πis)) * (e^(2πis) - e^(-2πis))\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the expression for F(s):\n\nF(s) = (-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist) * t(1-t) |[-1,1] + (1/(2πis)) * ((-1/(2πis)) * e^(-2πist) * (1 - 2t) |[-1,1] + (1/(πis)) * (-1/(2πis)) * (e^(2πis) - e^(-2πis)))\n\nNow, we can evaluate F(s) at the limits of integration and simplify:\n\nF(s) = (1/(4π^2s^2)) * (e^(2πis) - 2 + e^(-2πis))\n\nNow, we want to evaluate the integral ∫[0,∞) F(s) ds:\n\n∫[0,∞) F(s) ds = ∫[0,∞) (1/(4π^2s^2)) * (e^(2πis) - 2 + e^(-2πis)) ds\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not converge. The reason is that the Fourier transform F(s) of the given function f(t) does not decay fast enough as s goes to infinity. In other words, the function f(t) is not well-suited for the Fourier transform, and the integral ∫[0,∞) F(s) ds does not have a finite value."
