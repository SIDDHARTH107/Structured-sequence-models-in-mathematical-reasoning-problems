    "message_1": "In a race, there are 15 cars of 5 different colors. How many ways can the top 3 cars finish if no two cars of the same color can finish consecutively?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Choose the color for the 1st place car: There are 5 different colors, so there are 5 choices for the color of the car that finishes first.\n\n2. Choose the color for the 2nd place car: Since no two cars of the same color can finish consecutively, there are only 4 choices left for the color of the car that finishes second.\n\n3. Choose the color for the 3rd place car: Similarly, there are only 4 choices left for the color of the car that finishes third, as it cannot be the same color as the 2nd place car.\n\nNow, we need to consider the number of cars of each color.\n\n4. Choose the specific car for the 1st place: There are 3 cars of the chosen color, so there are 3 choices for the specific car that finishes first.\n\n5. Choose the specific car for the 2nd place: There are 3 cars of the chosen color, so there are 3 choices for the specific car that finishes second.\n\n6. Choose the specific car for the 3rd place: There are 3 cars of the chosen color, so there are 3 choices for the specific car that finishes third.\n\nTo find the total number of ways the top 3 cars can finish, we multiply the number of choices for each step:\n\n5 (1st place color) * 4 (2nd place color) * 4 (3rd place color) * 3 (1st place car) * 3 (2nd place car) * 3 (3rd place car) = 720 ways."
