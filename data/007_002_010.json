    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all these numbers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the given numbers. We can do this by finding the prime factorization of each number and then taking the highest power of each prime factor.\n\nPrime factorization of the given numbers:\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n6 = 2 * 3\n8 = 2^3\n9 = 3^2\n10 = 2 * 5\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor:\n2^3, 3^2, and 5\n\nMultiply these prime factors together:\n2^3 * 3^2 * 5 = 8 * 9 * 5 = 360\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 is 360."
