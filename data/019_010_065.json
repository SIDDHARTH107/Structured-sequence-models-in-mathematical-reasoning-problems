    "message_2": "To prove the given formula, we will use the given formulas and the rules of linear logic. The rules we will use are:\n\n1. Cut Rule: If Γ ⊢ A and Δ, A ⊢ B, then Γ, Δ ⊢ B.\n2. Tensor Introduction: If Γ ⊢ A and Δ ⊢ B, then Γ, Δ ⊢ A ⊗ B.\n3. Tensor Elimination: If Γ, A, B ⊢ C, then Γ, A ⊗ B ⊢ C.\n4. Implication Introduction: If Γ, A ⊢ B, then Γ ⊢ A ⊸ B.\n5. Implication Elimination: If Γ ⊢ A ⊸ B and Δ ⊢ A, then Γ, Δ ⊢ B.\n\nNow, let's prove the given formula step by step:\n\n1. A ⊢ A (by the identity rule)\n2. A, B ⊸ C ⊢ B ⊸ C (by the identity rule)\n3. A ⊢ A ⊗ (B ⊸ C) (by tensor introduction from steps 1 and 2)\n4. ⊢ A ⊸ (A ⊗ (B ⊸ C)) (by implication introduction from step 3)\n\nNow, let's work on the second part of the formula:\n\n5. A ⊸ B ⊢ A ⊸ B (by the identity rule)\n6. A ⊸ C ⊢ A ⊸ C (by the identity rule)\n7. (A ⊸ B), (A ⊸ C) ⊢ (A ⊸ B) ⊗ (A ⊸ C) (by tensor introduction from steps 5 and 6)\n8. ⊢ (A ⊸ B) ⊸ (A ⊸ C) ⊸ ((A ⊸ B) ⊗ (A ⊸ C)) (by implication introduction from step 7)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n9. A ⊸ (A ⊗ (B ⊸ C)) ⊢ A ⊸ (A ⊗ (B ⊸ C)) (by the identity rule)\n10. (A ⊸ B) ⊸ (A ⊸ C) ⊸ ((A ⊸ B) ⊗ (A ⊸ C)) ⊢ (A ⊸ B) ⊸ (A ⊸ C) ⊸ ((A ⊸ B) ⊗ (A ⊸ C)) (by the identity rule)\n\nFinally, we use the cut rule to combine the two parts:\n\n11. A ⊢ (A ⊗ (B ⊸ C)) ⊗ ((A ⊸ B) ⊸ (A ⊸ C)) (by cut rule from steps 4, 8, 9, and 10)\n\nThus, we have proved the given formula:\n\nA ⊸ (A ⊗ (B ⊸ C)) ⊗ ((A ⊸ B) ⊸ (A ⊸ C))"
