    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer has 800 pieces of oak lumber with lengths of 3 meters, 4 meters, and 6 meters. The manufacturer wants to produce two types of tables: a coffee table and a dining table. The coffee table requires 2 meters of lumber, while the dining table requires 4 meters of lumber. The profit margins for the coffee table and the dining table are $30 and $50, respectively. How many of each type of table should the manufacturer produce to maximize their profit while using all of the lumber available?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of coffee tables and y be the number of dining tables.\n\nThe total length of lumber used for coffee tables is 2x meters, and for dining tables is 4y meters. Since the manufacturer has 800 pieces of lumber, the total length of lumber available is 3 * 800 = 2400 meters. Therefore, we have the constraint:\n\n2x + 4y = 2400\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\n\nP(x, y) = 30x + 50y\n\nWe can solve the constraint equation for x or y and substitute it into the profit function to get a single-variable function. Let's solve for y:\n\n4y = 2400 - 2x\ny = (2400 - 2x) / 4\ny = 600 - 0.5x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the profit function:\n\nP(x) = 30x + 50(600 - 0.5x)\nP(x) = 30x + 30000 - 25x\nP(x) = 5x + 30000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of P(x). Since P(x) is a linear function, it has no critical points, and its maximum value will occur at the endpoints of the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region for x is determined by the constraint equation. The minimum value of x occurs when y = 0:\n\n2x + 4(0) = 2400\n2x = 2400\nx = 1200\n\nThe maximum value of x occurs when y is at its maximum value, which is when x = 0:\n\n2(0) + 4y = 2400\n4y = 2400\ny = 600\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at these endpoints:\n\nP(1200) = 5(1200) + 30000 = 6000 + 30000 = 36000\nP(0) = 5(0) + 30000 = 30000\n\nSince P(1200) > P(0), the maximum profit occurs when the manufacturer produces 1200 coffee tables and 0 dining tables. The maximum profit is $36,000."
