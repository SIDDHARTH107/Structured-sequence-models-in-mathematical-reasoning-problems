Investment B will bring a profit of $8,000 with a probability of 0.7 and a loss of $3,000 with a probability of 0.3. Using decision theory, which investment should the company choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which investment the company should choose using decision theory, we need to calculate the expected value of each investment. The expected value is the sum of the possible outcomes multiplied by their respective probabilities.\n\nFor Investment A:\nExpected Value (EV_A) = (Profit * Probability of Profit) + (Loss * Probability of Loss)\nEV_A = ($10,000 * 0.6) + (-$5,000 * 0.4)\nEV_A = $6,000 - $2,000\nEV_A = $4,000\n\nFor Investment B:\nExpected Value (EV_B) = (Profit * Probability of Profit) + (Loss * Probability of Loss)\nEV_B = ($8,000 * 0.7) + (-$3,000 * 0.3)\nEV_B = $5,600 - $900\nEV_B = $4,700\n\nComparing the expected values of both investments, Investment B has a higher expected value of $4,700 compared to Investment A's expected value of $4,000. Therefore, using decision theory, the company should choose Investment B."
