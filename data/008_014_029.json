    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to rewrite the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 -1 |\n    | 2 -4  2 |\n    | 1 0.5 -1 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  7  |\n    | -8  |\n    | 1.5 |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process or any other QR decomposition algorithm, we get:\n\nQ = |  0.8018  0.5345  0.2673 |\n    |  0.5345 -0.8018  0.2673 |\n    |  0.2673  0.2673  0.9347 |\n\nR = |  3.7417  1.6036 -0.5345 |\n    |  0      4.3094 -1.6036 |\n    |  0      0      1.0690 |\n\nNow, we have A = QR, and we want to solve Ax = b. We can rewrite this as QRx = b. To solve for x, we can first solve the system Qy = b for y, and then solve Rx = y for x.\n\nStep 1: Solve Qy = b for y\nQ^T * Qy = Q^T * b => y = R^-1 * Q^T * b\n\nQ^T = |  0.8018  0.5345  0.2673 |\n      |  0.5345 -0.8018  0.2673 |\n      |  0.2673  0.2673  0.9347 |\n\nQ^T * b = |  0.8018*7 + 0.5345*(-8) + 0.2673*1.5 |\n          |  0.5345*7 - 0.8018*(-8) + 0.2673*1.5 |\n          |  0.2673*7 + 0.2673*(-8) + 0.9347*1.5 |\n\nQ^T * b = |  9.0690 |\n          |  8.1380 |\n          |  0.2673 |\n\nStep 2: Solve Rx = y for x\nR = |  3.7417  1.6036 -0.5345 |\n    |  0      4.3094 -1.6036 |\n    |  0      0      1.0690 |\n\ny = |  9.0690 |\n    |  8.1380 |\n    |  0.2673 |\n\nUsing back-substitution, we can solve for x:\n\nz = 0.2673 / 1.0690 ≈ 0.25\ny = (8.1380 + 1.6036 * 0.25) / 4.3094 ≈ -1.5\nx = (9.0690 - 1.6036 * (-1.5) + 0.5345 * 0.25) / 3.7417 ≈ 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x ≈ 2, y ≈ -1.5, and z ≈ 0.25."
