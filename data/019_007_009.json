    "message_1": "Suppose we have a non-monotonic logic framework in which there are 20 premises, labeled 1 through 20. A conclusion C is derived from these premises. However, if premise 4 is removed, the conclusion C is no longer true. If premise 17 is also removed, then C becomes true again. How many different combinations of premises can we remove in which C is no longer true, and how many different combinations of premises can we remove in which C becomes true again?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. If premise 4 is removed, the conclusion C is no longer true.\n2. If premise 4 and 17 are removed, the conclusion C becomes true again.\n\nWe can infer that premise 4 is essential for the conclusion C to be true, and premise 17 can negate the effect of removing premise 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where C is no longer true. We can remove premise 4 alone or remove premise 4 along with any combination of the other 18 premises, excluding premise 17. So, we have 2^18 - 1 combinations (subtracting 1 because we don't count the case where no other premises are removed).\n\nFor the cases where C becomes true again, we need to remove both premise 4 and 17, along with any combination of the other 18 premises. So, we have 2^18 combinations.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 2^18 - 1 combinations of premises that can be removed in which C is no longer true, and 2^18 combinations of premises that can be removed in which C becomes true again."
