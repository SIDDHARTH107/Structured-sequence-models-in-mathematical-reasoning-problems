    "message_2": "To find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 48 and 60, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (60) by the smaller number (48) and find the remainder.\n   60 รท 48 = 1, remainder 12\n\n2. Replace the larger number (60) with the smaller number (48) and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 48 and 12.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (48) by the smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n   48 รท 12 = 4, remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12. So, the GCD of 48 and 60 is 12."
