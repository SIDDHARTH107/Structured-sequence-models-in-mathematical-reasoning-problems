Prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nHint: Use the fact that every element in G must have a certain order either 1, 2, or 4. Then, consider the possible combinations of elements with different orders in G.",
    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider the possible orders of elements in G. Since G has order 4, there are 4 elements in G, including the identity element e. We know that the order of e is 1. The other elements in G can have orders 1, 2, or 4.\n\nCase 1: There exists an element of order 4 in G.\nLet g be an element of order 4 in G. Then, g^4 = e, and g, g^2, g^3, and e are distinct elements in G. Since G has only 4 elements, G = {e, g, g^2, g^3}. This means that G is a cyclic group generated by g, and G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: There is no element of order 4 in G.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements in G must have order 2. Let G = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c are distinct non-identity elements. Since the elements have order 2, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e.\n\nNow, consider the product ab. Since a and b are distinct non-identity elements, ab ≠ e. Also, ab ≠ a and ab ≠ b, because if ab = a, then b = e, which contradicts the fact that b is a non-identity element (and similarly for ab = b). Therefore, ab = c. Then, we have:\n\n(ac)(bc) = a(bc)c = a(c^2)c = aec = ac = ab = c.\n\nSo, G = {e, a, b, c} with the following operation table:\n\n```\n  e a b c\ne e a b c\na a e c b\nb b c e a\nc c b a e\n```\n\nThis operation table corresponds to the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
