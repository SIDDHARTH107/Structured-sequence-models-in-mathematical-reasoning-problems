    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node F, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every node: set it to zero for the initial node (A) and infinity for all other nodes (B, C, D, E, F).\n2. Set the initial node (A) as the current node. Mark all other nodes unvisited. Create a set of unvisited nodes.\n3. For the current node (A), consider all its unvisited neighbors (B and C) and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the new value if it is less than the current assigned value.\n\n   A to B: 4\n   A to C: 1\n\n4. When all neighbors of the current node (A) are considered, mark the current node (A) as visited. A visited node will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance (C), and set it as the new current node, then go back to step 3. If all nodes have been visited, the algorithm has finished.\n\n   Current node: C\n\n6. For the current node (C), consider all its unvisited neighbors (B and E) and calculate their tentative distances.\n\n   C to B: 1 + 4 = 5 (smaller than the current value of B, so update it)\n   C to E: 1 + 4 = 5\n\n7. Mark the current node (C) as visited and select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance (B) as the new current node.\n\n   Current node: B\n\n8. For the current node (B), consider all its unvisited neighbors (D and E) and calculate their tentative distances.\n\n   B to D: 5 + 5 = 10\n   B to E: 5 + 4 = 9 (smaller than the current value of E, so update it)\n\n9. Mark the current node (B) as visited and select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance (E) as the new current node.\n\n   Current node: E\n\n10. For the current node (E), consider all its unvisited neighbors (D and F) and calculate their tentative distances.\n\n    E to D: 9 + 4 = 13 (greater than the current value of D, so no update)\n    E to F: 9 + 6 = 15\n\n11. Mark the current node (E) as visited and select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance (D) as the new current node.\n\n    Current node: D\n\n12. For the current node (D), consider all its unvisited neighbors (F) and calculate their tentative distances.\n\n    D to F: 10 + 3 = 13 (smaller than the current value of F, so update it)\n\n13. Mark the current node (D) as visited. All nodes are now visited, and the algorithm is finished.\n\nThe shortest path from node A to node F is A -> C -> B -> D -> F with a total distance of 13."
