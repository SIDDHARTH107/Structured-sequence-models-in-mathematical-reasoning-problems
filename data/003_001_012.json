    "message_1": "A right triangle has an adjacent side of 4 cm and an opposite side of 7 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this case, the adjacent side (a) is 4 cm and the opposite side (b) is 7 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc^2 = 4^2 + 7^2\nc^2 = 16 + 49\nc^2 = 65\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 65 to get the length of the hypotenuse (c):\n\nc = √65\nc ≈ 8.06 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is approximately 8.06 cm."
