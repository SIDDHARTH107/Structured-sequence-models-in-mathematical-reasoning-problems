    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 5 using the power rule, we apply the power rule to each term individually. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, x^4:\nThe derivative is 4x^(4-1) = 4x^3.\n\nFor the second term, -2x^2:\nThe derivative is -2(2)x^(2-1) = -4x^1 = -4x.\n\nFor the third term, 5:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 4x."
