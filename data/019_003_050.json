    "message_1": "Let's say a farmer has three fields of wheat. In each field, the percentage of wheat that has been harvested is 80%, 60%, and 90% respectively. Using modal logic, what is the minimum percentage of wheat that has been harvested in at least two fields?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum percentage of wheat that has been harvested in at least two fields, we can look at the given percentages and determine which two have the lowest values. In this case, the two lowest percentages are 60% and 80%. Therefore, the minimum percentage of wheat that has been harvested in at least two fields is 60%."
