    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula:\n\nSum of interior angles = (n - 2)π\n\nFor a regular heptagon, n = 7. So, the sum of the interior angles is:\n\nSum of interior angles = (7 - 2)π = 5π\n\nSince a regular heptagon has equal interior angles, we can find the measure of one angle by dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number of sides:\n\nHyperbolic angle of a regular heptagon = (5π) / 7\n\nTherefore, the hyperbolic angle of a regular heptagon in hyperbolic geometry is 5π/7 radians."
