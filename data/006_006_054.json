    "message_1": "In a basketball game, a player has a 70% chance of making a free throw. If the player attempts 10 free throws, what is the probability that they will make exactly 7 of them?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successful trials\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 10 (the player attempts 10 free throws)\n- k = 7 (we want to find the probability of making exactly 7 free throws)\n- p = 0.7 (the player has a 70% chance of making a free throw)\n\nFirst, let's find C(n, k) = C(10, 7). This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!(10-7)!) = 10! / (7!3!) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 120\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * p^7 * (1-p)^(10-7)\nP(X = 7) = 120 * (0.7)^7 * (0.3)^3\n\nCalculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.0823543 * 0.027 = 0.266827932\n\nSo, the probability of the player making exactly 7 out of 10 free throws is approximately 26.68%."
