    "message_2": "To prove that every subgroup of G is cyclic, we will use the fact that a cyclic group has a unique subgroup of every order that divides the order of the group.\n\nFirst, let's find the order of G. Since G is generated by 8, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that $8^n = 1$. We know that $8^3 = 512 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, and 3 is the smallest such exponent. Therefore, the order of G is 3, and G = {1, 8, 64}.\n\nNow, let H be a subgroup of G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G. Since the order of G is 3, the possible orders of H are 1, 3. \n\n1. If the order of H is 1, then H = {1}, which is a cyclic group generated by 1.\n\n2. If the order of H is 3, then H must contain all elements of G, so H = G. In this case, H is a cyclic group generated by 8.\n\nIn both cases, the subgroup H is cyclic. Therefore, every subgroup of G is cyclic."
