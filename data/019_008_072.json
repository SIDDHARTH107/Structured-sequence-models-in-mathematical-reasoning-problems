    "message_2": "To determine the point on a fuzzy logic scale of 0 to 1 at which the air conditioner should turn on, we need to first establish the range of temperatures we are working with. In this case, we have a current temperature of 75°F and a desired temperature of 70°F.\n\nNext, we need to normalize the temperature values within the 0 to 1 scale. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nNormalized value = (Current value - Minimum value) / (Maximum value - Minimum value)\n\nHowever, we need to define the minimum and maximum values for our temperature range. Let's assume that the minimum value is 60°F (a comfortably cool temperature) and the maximum value is 80°F (a warm temperature). Now we can normalize the current temperature (75°F) and desired temperature (70°F):\n\nNormalized current temperature = (75 - 60) / (80 - 60) = 15 / 20 = 0.75\nNormalized desired temperature = (70 - 60) / (80 - 60) = 10 / 20 = 0.5\n\nNow, we can determine the point on the fuzzy logic scale at which the air conditioner should turn on. Since we want the air conditioner to start cooling the room when the temperature reaches 70°F, we can use the normalized desired temperature value:\n\nFuzzy logic turn-on point = 0.5\n\nSo, on a fuzzy logic scale of 0 to 1, the air conditioner should turn on at a value of 0.5."
