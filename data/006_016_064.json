    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a defective product is 0.10. If a company produces 5000 products, what is the probability that at least 500 products will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k! * (n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a defective product (0.10)\n- n is the total number of products (5000)\n- k is the number of defective products\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of having at least 500 defective products, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 500, 501, 502, ..., 5000.\n\nTo do this, we can use the complement rule, which states that:\n\nP(at least 500 defective) = 1 - P(less than 500 defective)\n\nSo, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 499.\n\nCalculating this directly would be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of a binomial distribution are given by:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nFor our problem:\n\nμ = 5000 * 0.10 = 500\nσ = sqrt(5000 * 0.10 * 0.90) ≈ 21.08\n\nNow, we can standardize the value of 499.5 (using 499.5 instead of 499 for continuity correction) and find the corresponding z-score:\n\nz = (499.5 - 500) / 21.08 ≈ -0.024\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find the probability for z = -0.024:\n\nP(z ≤ -0.024) ≈ 0.490\n\nFinally, we use the complement rule:\n\nP(at least 500 defective) = 1 - P(less than 500 defective) = 1 - 0.490 = 0.510\n\nSo, the probability that at least 500 products will be defective is approximately 0.510 or 51%."
