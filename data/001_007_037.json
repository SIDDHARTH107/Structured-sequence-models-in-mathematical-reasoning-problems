    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 2 < 5x - 4, we need to isolate x on one side of the inequality. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality.\n3x + 2 - 3x < 5x - 4 - 3x\n2 < 2x - 4\n\nStep 2: Add 4 to both sides of the inequality.\n2 + 4 < 2x - 4 + 4\n6 < 2x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 2.\n6 / 2 < 2x / 2\n3 < x\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x > 3."
