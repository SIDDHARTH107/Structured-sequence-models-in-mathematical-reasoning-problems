    "message_2": "To find the survival probability at time t=6 years, we need to evaluate the survival function S(t) at t=6:\n\nS(6) = exp(-0.05 * 6)\n\nS(6) = exp(-0.3)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of exp(-0.3):\n\nS(6) â‰ˆ 0.740818\n\nSo, the survival probability at time t=6 years is approximately 74.08%.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the individuals have a 60% chance of surviving up to 8 years. This information is not needed to solve the problem using the given survival function. The survival function S(t) alone is sufficient to find the survival probability at any given time t."
