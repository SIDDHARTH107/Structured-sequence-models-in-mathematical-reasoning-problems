    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation with the given initial condition, we first assume a separable solution of the form $\\psi(x,t) = u(x)v(t)$. Substituting this into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n$i u(x) \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} u''(x) v(t)$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $u(x)v(t)$:\n\n$i \\frac{1}{v(t)} \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2u(x)} u''(x)$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $E$:\n\n$i \\frac{1}{v(t)} \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = E = \\frac{1}{2u(x)} u''(x)$\n\nNow we have two separate ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $i \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = Ev(t)$\n2) $u''(x) = 2Eu(x)$\n\nSolving the first equation for $v(t)$, we get:\n\n$v(t) = e^{-iEt}$\n\nSolving the second equation for $u(x)$, we get:\n\n$u(x) = A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}$, where $k^2 = 2E$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for $\\psi(x,t)$ as:\n\n$\\psi(x,t) = u(x)v(t) = (A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}) e^{-iEt}$\n\nUsing the initial condition $\\psi(x,0) = Ce^{ikx}$, we find that $A = C$ and $B = 0$. Therefore, the general solution is:\n\n$\\psi(x,t) = Ce^{ikx}e^{-iEt}$"
