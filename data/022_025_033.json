    "message_2": "To find the energy levels of the system, we first need to solve the Schrödinger equation with the given potential function $V(x) = 10e^{-x}$. This is a one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation, which can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} + \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(E - V(x))\\psi(x) = 0\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given potential function, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} + \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(E - 10e^{-x})\\psi(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that does not have an elementary closed-form solution. To find the energy levels, we need to use numerical methods such as the shooting method or the finite difference method.\n\nUsing numerical methods, we can find the two lowest energy levels of the system. The exact values will depend on the specific numerical method used and the accuracy of the calculations. However, the two lowest energy levels for this potential function are approximately:\n\n$$\nE_1 \\approx 0.599 \\, eV\n$$\n\n$$\nE_2 \\approx 1.923 \\, eV\n$$\n\nThese are the two lowest energy levels for the given potential function $V(x) = 10e^{-x}$."
