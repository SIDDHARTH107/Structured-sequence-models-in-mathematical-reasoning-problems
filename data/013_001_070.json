    "message_1": "Hereâ€™s a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nIn a Prisoner's Dilemma game, two players are given a choice to either cooperate or defect. If both players cooperate, they both receive a payoff of 3. If both players defect, they both receive a payoff of 1. If one player cooperates and the other player defects, the defector receives a payoff of 5 and the cooperator receives a payoff of 0. Find the Nash equilibrium for this game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the payoffs for each player when they choose to cooperate or defect. Let's denote the strategies as C for cooperation and D for defection. We have four possible outcomes:\n\n1. Both players cooperate (C, C): Both players receive a payoff of 3.\n2. Both players defect (D, D): Both players receive a payoff of 1.\n3. Player 1 cooperates, and player 2 defects (C, D): Player 1 receives a payoff of 0, and player 2 receives a payoff of 5.\n4. Player 1 defects, and player 2 cooperates (D, C): Player 1 receives a payoff of 5, and player 2 receives a payoff of 0.\n\nA Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. Let's analyze each player's payoffs:\n\n- If player 1 cooperates (C), player 2's best response is to defect (D) since 5 > 3.\n- If player 1 defects (D), player 2's best response is also to defect (D) since 1 > 0.\n- If player 2 cooperates (C), player 1's best response is to defect (D) since 5 > 3.\n- If player 2 defects (D), player 1's best response is also to defect (D) since 1 > 0.\n\nIn all cases, the best response for both players is to defect (D). Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for this game is when both players defect (D, D), and they both receive a payoff of 1."
