    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{32}$, we need to find the prime factorization of 32 and then look for pairs of the same factors.\n\nThe prime factorization of 32 is $2^5$ (2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as $\\sqrt{2^5}$.\n\nFor every pair of the same factors, we can take one factor out of the square root. In this case, we have two pairs of 2's and one 2 left inside the square root.\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is $2^2\\sqrt{2}$, which is equal to $4\\sqrt{2}$."
