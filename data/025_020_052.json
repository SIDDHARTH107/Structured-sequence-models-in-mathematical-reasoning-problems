    "message_2": "The given equation $x^5 + y^5 + z^5 + w^5 = 0$ defines a hypersurface in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The dimension of a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ is given by $n-1$. In this case, since we are working in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, the dimension of the Calabi-Yau variety defined by the given equation is $3-1 = 2$."
