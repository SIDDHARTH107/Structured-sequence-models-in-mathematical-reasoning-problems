    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. Instead of finding the probability of rolling at least one 5 in 8 rolls, we can find the probability of not rolling a 5 in 8 rolls and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not rolling a 5 on a single roll is 5/6 (since there are 5 other outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6).\n\nThe probability of not rolling a 5 in all 8 rolls is (5/6)^8.\n\nNow, we find the complement probability by subtracting this value from 1:\n\n1 - (5/6)^8 â‰ˆ 0.7674\n\nSo, the probability of rolling at least one 5 in 8 rolls of a standard six-sided dice is approximately 0.7674 or 76.74%."
