    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given function y = 3cos(2x + π/4), we need to analyze the function and identify the key components.\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is y = A*cos(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our given function, y = 3cos(2x + π/4), we can identify the following components:\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a cosine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the cosine function, which is B. The period is given by the formula (2π)/B. In our function, B = 2. So, the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\nThus, the amplitude of the function y = 3cos(2x + π/4) is 3, and the period is π."
