    "message_1": "Suppose there are three boxes, labeled A, B, and C. One box contains only apples, one box contains only oranges, and one box contains both apples and oranges. You are allowed to pick one fruit from one box. Can you determine which box to pick to guarantee that you pick an apple? If so, which box should you pick?",
    "message_2": "Yes, you can determine which box to pick to guarantee that you pick an apple. You should pick a fruit from the box labeled \"Apples and Oranges.\"\n\nHere's the reasoning: The labels on the boxes are guaranteed to be incorrect. So, the box labeled \"Apples and Oranges\" cannot contain both apples and oranges. It must contain either only apples or only oranges.\n\nIf it contains only apples, you will pick an apple. If it contains only oranges, then the box labeled \"Apples\" must contain both apples and oranges (since the labels are incorrect), and the box labeled \"Oranges\" must contain only apples. In either case, you will still pick an apple from the box labeled \"Apples and Oranges.\""
