    "message_1": "A steel cone needs to be constructed that has a base radius of 8 inches and a slant height of 15 inches. What is the height of the cone that will minimize the amount of steel needed to construct it, assuming that steel cost $2.50 per square inch? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of steel needed, we need to minimize the surface area of the cone. The surface area of a cone is given by the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the base radius, and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 8 inches and l = 15 inches. We also know that the height (h), radius (r), and slant height (l) are related by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nl^2 = r^2 + h^2\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of r and l:\n\nh^2 = l^2 - r^2\nh = sqrt(l^2 - r^2)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for h into the surface area formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + sqrt(l^2 - r^2))\n\nWe are given that l = 15 and r = 8, so we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = π(8)(8 + sqrt(15^2 - 8^2))\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = 8π(8 + sqrt(225 - 64))\nSurface Area = 8π(8 + sqrt(161))\nSurface Area ≈ 8π(8 + 12.69)\nSurface Area ≈ 8π(20.69)\nSurface Area ≈ 520.67 square inches\n\nNow, we need to find the cost of the steel needed to construct the cone. We are given that steel costs $2.50 per square inch:\n\nCost = Surface Area × Price per square inch\nCost = 520.67 × $2.50\nCost ≈ $1301.68\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the cone that will minimize the amount of steel needed. We can use the expression for h that we found earlier:\n\nh = sqrt(l^2 - r^2)\nh = sqrt(15^2 - 8^2)\nh = sqrt(225 - 64)\nh = sqrt(161)\nh ≈ 12.69 inches\n\nSo, the height of the cone that will minimize the amount of steel needed is approximately 12.69 inches."
