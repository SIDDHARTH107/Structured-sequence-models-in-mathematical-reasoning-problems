    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a graph with 6 vertices such that each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices. What is the minimum number of colors required to properly color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of graph theory and the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nSince each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices, the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph is 3. According to the theorem, the chromatic number of a graph is at most one more than the maximum degree of its vertices. In this case, the chromatic number is at most 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nHowever, we need to check if it's possible to color the graph with fewer colors. Let's try to color the graph with 3 colors. If we can find a proper coloring with 3 colors, then the minimum number of colors required is 3.\n\nConsider a cycle of length 3 in the graph (a triangle). Since each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices, there must be at least one triangle in the graph. In a triangle, each vertex is adjacent to the other two vertices, so we need 3 different colors to color the vertices of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors required to properly color the vertices of the given graph is 3."
