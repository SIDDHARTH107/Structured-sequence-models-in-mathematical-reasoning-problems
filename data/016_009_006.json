    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. After each iteration, the total length of the Dragon curve increases.\n\nLet's denote the total length of the Dragon curve after n iterations as L(n). The initial length of the curve is 1 unit, so L(0) = 1.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of each line segment is reduced by a factor of √2, and two more line segments are added. So, L(1) = 1 * (√2/2) + 1 * (√2/2) = √2.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the length of each line segment is again reduced by a factor of √2, and the number of line segments doubles. Therefore, the total length of the Dragon curve after n iterations can be expressed as:\n\nL(n) = L(n-1) * 2^(n-1) * (√2/2)\n\nNow, we want to find the total length of the Dragon curve after 12 iterations, i.e., L(12).\n\nWe can calculate L(12) using the formula above and the fact that L(1) = √2:\n\nL(12) = L(1) * 2^(12-1) * (√2/2)\nL(12) = √2 * 2^11 * (√2/2)\nL(12) = √2 * 2^11 * √2 / 2\nL(12) = 2^11\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after 12 iterations is 2^11 = 2048 units."
