    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the symmetric difference of A and B, A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. We need to define a universal set U for this problem. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nA' = U - A = {4, 5}\nB' = U - B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's calculate the symmetric difference of A' and B', A' △ B':\n\nA' △ B' = {1, 4}\n\nFinally, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B, (A △ B)':\n\n(A △ B)' = U - (A △ B) = {2, 3, 5}\n\nNow, we can compare (A △ B)' and A' △ B':\n\n(A △ B)' = {2, 3, 5}\nA' △ B' = {1, 4}\n\nSince (A △ B)' ≠ A' △ B', we can conclude that the symmetric difference is not distributive over the complement."
