    "message_1": "A magician has a bag of 10 red balls and 8 blue balls. If she randomly selects 5 balls from the bag, what is the probability that she selects exactly 3 red balls and 2 blue balls during her performance?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to find the number of ways to choose 3 red balls out of 10 and 2 blue balls out of 8, and then divide that by the total number of ways to choose 5 balls out of 18.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 red balls out of 10 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 10 and k = 3.\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!) = 10! / (3!7!) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 120\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 blue balls out of 8 is given by the combination formula with n = 8 and k = 2.\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = (8 × 7) / (2 × 1) = 28\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 5 balls out of 18. Using the combination formula with n = 18 and k = 5:\n\nC(18, 5) = 18! / (5!(18-5)!) = 18! / (5!13!) = (18 × 17 × 16 × 15 × 14) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 8568\n\nTo find the probability of selecting exactly 3 red balls and 2 blue balls, we multiply the number of ways to choose 3 red balls and 2 blue balls and divide by the total number of ways to choose 5 balls:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 3 red and 2 blue balls) / (Total number of ways to choose 5 balls)\nProbability = (120 × 28) / 8568 = 3360 / 8568 ≈ 0.392\n\nSo, the probability of selecting exactly 3 red balls and 2 blue balls during her performance is approximately 0.392 or 39.2%."
