    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting the sequence H-T-H in that order, we need to consider the possible positions of this sequence in the 10 coin flips.\n\nThere are 8 possible positions for the H-T-H sequence in the 10 coin flips:\n\n1. H-T-H-X-X-X-X-X-X-X\n2. X-H-T-H-X-X-X-X-X-X\n3. X-X-H-T-H-X-X-X-X-X\n4. X-X-X-H-T-H-X-X-X-X\n5. X-X-X-X-H-T-H-X-X-X\n6. X-X-X-X-X-H-T-H-X-X\n7. X-X-X-X-X-X-H-T-H-X\n8. X-X-X-X-X-X-X-H-T-H\n\nFor each of these positions, we need to calculate the probability of the H-T-H sequence occurring and then sum up the probabilities.\n\nThe probability of getting a specific sequence of heads (H) and tails (T) in 3 coin flips is (1/2)^3 = 1/8, since each flip has a 1/2 chance of being H or T.\n\nFor each of the 8 positions, there are 7 remaining coin flips. The probability of any specific sequence of 7 coin flips is (1/2)^7 = 1/128.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the probabilities for each position and then sum them up:\n\n1. (1/8) * (1/128) = 1/1024\n2. (1/8) * (1/128) = 1/1024\n3. (1/8) * (1/128) = 1/1024\n4. (1/8) * (1/128) = 1/1024\n5. (1/8) * (1/128) = 1/1024\n6. (1/8) * (1/128) = 1/1024\n7. (1/8) * (1/128) = 1/1024\n8. (1/8) * (1/128) = 1/1024\n\nSumming up these probabilities:\n\n1/1024 + 1/1024 + 1/1024 + 1/1024 + 1/1024 + 1/1024 + 1/1024 + 1/1024 = 8/1024\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n8/1024 = 1/128\n\nSo, the probability of getting the sequence H-T-H in that order in 10 coin flips is 1/128."
