    "message_1": "A sinusoidal function of the form y = 2cos(3x - 60°) has been given. Find the period and amplitude of the given function.",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 2cos(3x - 60°).\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A*cos(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our given function, A = 2, B = 3, and C = 60°.\n\nAmplitude (A) is the maximum value of the function, which is the distance from the maximum point to the horizontal axis. In this case, the amplitude is 2.\n\nThe period of a sinusoidal function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. The period (T) can be found using the formula T = 2π/B. In our case, B = 3.\n\nT = 2π/3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the given function is 2, and the period is 2π/3."
