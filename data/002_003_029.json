    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula: Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2. In this case, the side length is 8 cm.\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (8 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 6 * 64 cm^2\nSurface Area = 384 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 384 square centimeters."
