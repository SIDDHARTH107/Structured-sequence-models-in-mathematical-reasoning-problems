    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, if we raise a to the power of p and divide by p, the remainder is a.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the remainder when 1423 is divided by 11. Since 11 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nAccording to the theorem, 1423^11 ≡ 1423 (mod 11). Now, we need to find the remainder when 1423 is divided by 11.\n\n1423 ÷ 11 = 129 with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, the remainder when 1423 is divided by 11 is 4."
