    "message_2": "To determine the probability that a coin is fair given that it was flipped 100 times and landed heads 55 times, we can use the binomial test. The binomial test compares the observed number of successes (in this case, heads) to the expected number of successes under the null hypothesis (in this case, that the coin is fair).\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that the coin is fair, meaning the probability of getting heads (p) is 0.5. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the coin is not fair, meaning p ≠ 0.5.\n\nWe can use the binomial formula to calculate the probability of observing 55 heads in 100 flips if the coin is fair:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n = number of trials (100 flips)\n- k = number of successes (55 heads)\n- p = probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin)\n- C(n, k) = number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n\nFirst, calculate C(100, 55):\n\nC(100, 55) = 100! / (55! * (100 - 55)!)\nC(100, 55) ≈ 2.533 × 10^29\n\nNext, calculate the probability of observing 55 heads in 100 flips if the coin is fair:\n\nP(X = 55) = C(100, 55) * 0.5^55 * 0.5^(100 - 55)\nP(X = 55) ≈ 2.533 × 10^29 * 0.5^100\nP(X = 55) ≈ 0.048\n\nThe probability of observing 55 heads in 100 flips if the coin is fair is approximately 0.048, or 4.8%. However, this is not the probability that the coin is fair given the observed data. To determine that, we would need to use Bayesian inference, which requires specifying a prior probability distribution for the fairness of the coin. Without this information, we cannot directly calculate the probability that the coin is fair given the observed data."
