    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature (K) of a cone can be calculated using the formula:\n\nK = -c^2 / (1 + c^2)^2\n\nwhere c is the slant height of the cone divided by the radius.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (s) of the cone using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\ns = √(h^2 + r^2)\n\nwhere h is the height of the cone (6 meters) and r is the radius (4 meters).\n\ns = √(6^2 + 4^2) = √(36 + 16) = √52 ≈ 7.21 meters\n\nNow, we can find c:\n\nc = s / r = 7.21 / 4 ≈ 1.80\n\nNext, we can calculate the Gaussian curvature:\n\nK = -1.80^2 / (1 + 1.80^2)^2 ≈ -3.24 / (1 + 3.24)^2 ≈ -3.24 / 18.62 ≈ -0.174\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the Gaussian curvature of the cone is approximately -0.2."
