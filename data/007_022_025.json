    "message_2": "To find the order of the point $P = (3, 1)$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $nP = \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity and $nP$ is the result of adding the point $P$ to itself $n$ times.\n\nWe will use the point addition and point doubling formulas for elliptic curves. Let $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ be two points on the elliptic curve $E$. Then, the point addition $R = P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is given by:\n\n1. If $P = \\mathcal{O}$, then $R = Q$.\n2. If $Q = \\mathcal{O}$, then $R = P$.\n3. If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$, then $R = \\mathcal{O}$.\n4. If $P = Q$, then $R = 2P$ and the point doubling formulas are used:\n   $$\n   \\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} \\pmod{p} \\\\\n   x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\pmod{p} \\\\\n   y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{p}\n   $$\n   where $a$ is the coefficient of the elliptic curve equation and $p$ is the prime number of the finite field.\n5. If $P \\neq Q$, then the point addition formulas are used:\n   $$\n   \\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\pmod{p} \\\\\n   x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\pmod{p} \\\\\n   y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{p}\n   $$\n\nNow, we will compute the multiples of $P$ until we find the point at infinity:\n\n1. $P = (3, 1)$\n2. $2P = (3, 1) + (3, 1) = (10, 6)$\n3. $3P = (3, 1) + (10, 6) = (12, 8)$\n4. $4P = (3, 1) + (12, 8) = (7, 11)$\n5. $5P = (3, 1) + (7, 11) = (0, 2)$\n6. $6P = (3, 1) + (0, 2) = (2, 9)$\n7. $7P = (3, 1) + (2, 9) = (6, 3)$\n8. $8P = (3, 1) + (6, 3) = (11, 4)$\n9. $9P = (3, 1) + (11, 4) = (9, 7)$\n10. $10P = (3, 1) + (9, 7) = (8, 10)$\n11. $11P = (3, 1) + (8, 10) = (1, 5)$\n12. $12P = (3, 1) + (1, 5) = (4, 12)$\n13. $13P = (3, 1) + (4, 12) = \\mathcal{O}$\n\nWe found that $13P = \\mathcal{O}$, so the order of the point $P = (3, 1)$ over the group $E(\\mathbb{F}_{13})$ is $13$."
