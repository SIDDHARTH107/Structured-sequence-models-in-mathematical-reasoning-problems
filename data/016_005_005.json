    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each segment. After each iteration, the remaining length is 2/3 of the previous length. Let's calculate the length of the Cantor set after 4 iterations.\n\nInitial length (iteration 0): 1\nAfter 1st iteration: 1 * (2/3) = 2/3\nAfter 2nd iteration: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\nAfter 3rd iteration: (4/9) * (2/3) = 8/27\nAfter 4th iteration: (8/27) * (2/3) = 16/81\n\nSo, the length of the Cantor set after 4 iterations is 16/81."
