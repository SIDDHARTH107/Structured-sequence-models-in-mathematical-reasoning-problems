    "message_2": "To find a cyclic subgroup of G generated by g^4, we first need to determine the order of the element g^4. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that (g^4)^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group.\n\nSince G is a cyclic group of order 24, we know that g^24 = e. Now, let's find the order of g^4. We are looking for the smallest positive integer n such that (g^4)^n = g^(4n) = e.\n\nSince g^24 = e, we know that 24 is a multiple of the order of g^4. Let's find the smallest positive integer n such that 4n divides 24. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. The smallest divisor of 24 that is also a multiple of 4 is 4 itself. So, 4n = 24, and n = 6.\n\nThus, the order of g^4 is 6. Now, we can find the cyclic subgroup of G generated by g^4. The cyclic subgroup generated by g^4 is the set {e, g^4, (g^4)^2, (g^4)^3, (g^4)^4, (g^4)^5}, which is {e, g^4, g^8, g^12, g^16, g^20}.\n\nSo, the cyclic subgroup of G generated by g^4 is {e, g^4, g^8, g^12, g^16, g^20}, and it has order 6."
