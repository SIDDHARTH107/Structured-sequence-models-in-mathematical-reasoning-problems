    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group H^1(X; Z), we will first need to determine the singular chain complex C of X with integer coefficients. Since X is a square, it can be triangulated into two triangles, and we can describe its simplicial structure.\n\nLet's label the vertices of the square as A, B, C, and D, with A and B on the bottom edge, C and D on the top edge, and edges AB, BC, CD, and DA. We can triangulate the square into two triangles, ABC and ACD.\n\nNow, we can describe the singular chain complex C of X:\n\n- C_0 consists of the 0-simplices (vertices): A, B, C, and D.\n- C_1 consists of the 1-simplices (edges): AB, BC, CD, DA, and the diagonal AC.\n- C_2 consists of the 2-simplices (triangles): ABC and ACD.\n\nNext, we need to determine the boundary maps:\n\n- ∂_0: C_0 → 0, since there are no -1-simplices.\n- ∂_1: C_1 → C_0, given by ∂_1(AB) = B - A, ∂_1(BC) = C - B, ∂_1(CD) = D - C, ∂_1(DA) = A - D, and ∂_1(AC) = C - A.\n- ∂_2: C_2 → C_1, given by ∂_2(ABC) = BC - AB + AC and ∂_2(ACD) = CD - AC + AD.\n\nNow we can determine the cochain complex C*:\n\n- C^0 consists of functions from C_0 to Z.\n- C^1 consists of functions from C_1 to Z.\n- C^2 consists of functions from C_2 to Z.\n\nThe coboundary maps are the duals of the boundary maps:\n\n- δ^0: C^0 → C^1, given by δ^0(f)(AB) = f(B) - f(A), and similarly for other edges.\n- δ^1: C^1 → C^2, given by δ^1(g)(ABC) = g(BC) - g(AB) + g(AC), and similarly for other triangles.\n\nNow, we can compute the first cohomology group H^1(X; Z) as the quotient of the kernel of δ^1 and the image of δ^0:\n\n- ker(δ^1) consists of functions g in C^1 such that δ^1(g) = 0 for all 2-simplices. In this case, it means g(BC) - g(AB) + g(AC) = 0 and g(CD) - g(AC) + g(AD) = 0. These two equations imply that g(AB) = g(AD) and g(BC) = g(CD).\n- im(δ^0) consists of functions of the form δ^0(f) for some f in C^0. In this case, it means functions g in C^1 such that g(AB) = f(B) - f(A), g(BC) = f(C) - f(B), g(CD) = f(D) - f(C), g(DA) = f(A) - f(D), and g(AC) = f(C) - f(A).\n\nTaking the quotient ker(δ^1) / im(δ^0), we find that H^1(X; Z) is isomorphic to Z, generated by the cohomology class represented by the function g(AB) = g(AD) = 1 and g(BC) = g(CD) = -1. This is because any other function in ker(δ^1) can be obtained by adding an element from im(δ^0) to this representative."
