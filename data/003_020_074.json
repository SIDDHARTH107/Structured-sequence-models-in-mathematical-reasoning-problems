    "message_1": "A flagpole is erected on level ground. If the angle of elevation from 50 feet away is 35 degrees, what is the height of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, we have the angle of elevation (35 degrees) and the distance from the flagpole (50 feet). We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(35°) = height / 50 feet\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight = 50 feet * tan(35°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the height:\n\nheight ≈ 50 * tan(35°)\nheight ≈ 50 * 0.7002\nheight ≈ 35.01 feet\n\nThe height of the flagpole is approximately 35.01 feet."
