    "message_2": "The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nTo find A', we can list all the elements in U that are not in A:\n\nA' = {6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of A and A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. Since A and A' are complements, they do not share any common elements.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of A and A' is the empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅"
