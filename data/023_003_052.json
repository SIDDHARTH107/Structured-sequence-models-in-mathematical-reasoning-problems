    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using Fourier series, we first assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of x and t, i.e.,\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $kXT$ to separate the variables:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the separation constant. Now we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1. $T'(t) + k\\lambda T(t) = 0$\n2. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nWe first solve the second ODE. Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous, we can use the eigenfunction expansion method. The general solution for the second ODE is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$X(0) = B = 0$$\n$$X(\\pi) = A\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi) = 0$$\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, $\\lambda = n^2$.\n\nNow, we solve the first ODE:\n\n$$T'(t) + k\\lambda T(t) = T'(t) + k n^2 T(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for this ODE is:\n\n$$T(t) = Ce^{-kn^2t}$$\n\nNow, we can write the solution $u(x,t)$ as a sum of the product of the solutions of the ODEs:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n e^{-kn^2t}\\sin(nx)$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $C_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = 2\\sin(2x)$:\n\n$$2\\sin(2x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin(nx)$$\n\nComparing the terms, we see that $C_2 = 2$ and all other coefficients are zero. Therefore, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = 2e^{-4kt}\\sin(2x)$$"
