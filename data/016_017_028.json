    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the Heighway Dragon Curve, the perimeter (P) of the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP = n * 2^(n-1)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the perimeter of the 5th iteration, so we can plug in n = 5:\n\nP = 5 * 2^(5-1)\nP = 5 * 2^4\nP = 5 * 16\nP = 80\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 5th iteration of the Heighway Dragon Curve with one segment having a length of 1 unit is 80 units."
