    "message_1": "A hot air balloon is rising vertically at a rate of 10 feet per second. At a height of 200 feet, how fast is the distance from the balloon to an observer on the ground increasing when the balloon is 250 feet high? Given that the observer is 150 feet away from the point on the ground directly beneath the balloon. (Note: assume that the observer and the balloon are on a straight line that is perpendicular to the ground.)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the balloon above the ground as h, the distance from the observer to the point on the ground directly beneath the balloon as x (which is constant and equal to 150 feet), and the distance from the observer to the balloon as r. We are given that dh/dt = 10 feet per second.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate h, x, and r:\n\nx^2 + h^2 = r^2\n\nWe are given that when h = 200 feet, the balloon is rising at a rate of 10 feet per second. We want to find dr/dt when h = 250 feet.\n\nFirst, let's differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2h(dh/dt) = 2r(dr/dt)\n\nSince x is constant, dx/dt = 0. We can simplify the equation:\n\n2h(dh/dt) = 2r(dr/dt)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dr/dt when h = 250 feet. We know that dh/dt = 10 feet per second. To find r when h = 250 feet, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nr^2 = x^2 + h^2\nr^2 = 150^2 + 250^2\nr^2 = 22500 + 62500\nr^2 = 85000\nr = √85000 ≈ 291.55 feet\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\n2(250)(10) = 2(291.55)(dr/dt)\n\n5000 = 583.1(dr/dt)\n\n(dr/dt) ≈ 5000 / 583.1 ≈ 8.58 feet per second\n\nSo, when the balloon is 250 feet high, the distance from the balloon to the observer is increasing at a rate of approximately 8.58 feet per second."
