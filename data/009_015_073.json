    "message_1": "A substance has an initial mass of 500 grams and its half-life is 20 years. Write a radioactive decay equation for the substance and use it to determine how much of the substance will remain after 80 years.",
    "message_2": "To write a radioactive decay equation for the substance, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 500 grams, the half-life is 20 years, and we want to find the final mass after 80 years.\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^(80 / 20)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of half-lives that have passed in 80 years:\n\n80 years / 20 years/half-life = 4 half-lives\n\nNow, we can plug this into the equation:\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/16)\n\nFinal mass = 500 * 0.0625\n\nFinal mass = 31.25 grams\n\nSo, after 80 years, there will be 31.25 grams of the substance remaining."
