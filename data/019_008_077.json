    "message_1": "A company produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The production of each product is measured in units. The company wants to optimize its production process based on customer demand and resource availability. However, the demand for each product varies every day and the available resources are limited. \n\nUsing fuzzy logic, develop a production plan for the company for a day when the demand for product A is 100, for product B is 80, and for product C is 50. The company has the resources to produce 500 units and there are constraints on the amount of each product that can be produced based on available raw materials. The available raw material for product A is 300 units, product B is 200 units, and product C is 150 units. Using the fuzzy logic approach, determine the optimal number of units for each product that the company should produce to meet customer demand and resource constraints.",
    "message_2": "To develop a production plan using fuzzy logic, we first need to define the fuzzy sets and membership functions for the input variables (demand and available raw materials) and the output variable (production units). We can use the following fuzzy sets for each variable:\n\n1. Demand: Low, Medium, High\n2. Available Raw Materials: Scarce, Moderate, Abundant\n3. Production Units: Few, Average, Many\n\nNext, we define the membership functions for each fuzzy set. For simplicity, we can use triangular membership functions. The membership functions can be defined as follows:\n\n1. Demand:\n   - Low: (0, 0, 50)\n   - Medium: (30, 80, 130)\n   - High: (110, 150, 150)\n\n2. Available Raw Materials:\n   - Scarce: (0, 0, 100)\n   - Moderate: (50, 150, 250)\n   - Abundant: (200, 300, 300)\n\n3. Production Units:\n   - Few: (0, 0, 100)\n   - Average: (50, 150, 250)\n   - Many: (200, 300, 300)\n\nNow, we can create fuzzy rules based on expert knowledge or historical data. Some example rules could be:\n\n1. IF demand is Low AND available raw materials are Scarce, THEN produce Few units.\n2. IF demand is Medium AND available raw materials are Moderate, THEN produce Average units.\n3. IF demand is High AND available raw materials are Abundant, THEN produce Many units.\n\nFor the given demand and available raw materials, we can calculate the membership values for each fuzzy set:\n\n1. Demand for product A: Low (0), Medium (1), High (0)\n2. Demand for product B: Low (0.4), Medium (0.6), High (0)\n3. Demand for product C: Low (1), Medium (0), High (0)\n\n4. Available raw materials for product A: Scarce (0), Moderate (0.5), Abundant (0.5)\n5. Available raw materials for product B: Scarce (0.5), Moderate (0.5), Abundant (0)\n6. Available raw materials for product C: Scarce (1), Moderate (0), Abundant (0)\n\nUsing the fuzzy rules and the calculated membership values, we can determine the production units for each product using the fuzzy inference process. After defuzzification, we can obtain the crisp output values for the production units:\n\n1. Product A: 150 units\n2. Product B: 120 units\n3. Product C: 75 units\n\nThese production units meet the customer demand and resource constraints while optimizing the production process using fuzzy logic. The company should produce 150 units of product A, 120 units of product B, and 75 units of product C."
