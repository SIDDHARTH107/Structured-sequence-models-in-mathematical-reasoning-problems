    "message_2": "(a) To find the critical points of f, we need to find the points where the gradient of f is zero. The gradient of f is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y) = (4x - 4, 6y - 6)\n\nSetting the partial derivatives equal to zero, we get:\n\n4x - 4 = 0 => x = 1\n6y - 6 = 0 => y = 1\n\nSo there is only one critical point, which is (1, 1).\n\n(b) To determine the number of critical points with index 0, 1, and 2, we need to analyze the Hessian matrix of f. The Hessian matrix is given by the second partial derivatives:\n\nH(f) = | ∂²f/∂x²  ∂²f/∂x∂y |\n          | ∂²f/∂y∂x  ∂²f/∂y² |\n\nH(f) = | 4  0 |\n          | 0  6 |\n\nThe Hessian matrix is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries, which are 4 and 6. Both eigenvalues are positive, so the critical point (1, 1) has index 0. Therefore, there is 1 critical point with index 0, and 0 critical points with index 1 and 2.\n\n(c) The Morse polynomial is given by:\n\nP(t) = (1 + t^0)^m0 * (1 + t^1)^m1 * (1 + t^2)^m2\n\nwhere m0, m1, and m2 are the number of critical points with index 0, 1, and 2, respectively. In our case, m0 = 1, m1 = 0, and m2 = 0. So the Morse polynomial is:\n\nP(t) = (1 + t^0)^1 * (1 + t^1)^0 * (1 + t^2)^0\nP(t) = (1 + 1) * 1 * 1\nP(t) = 2"
