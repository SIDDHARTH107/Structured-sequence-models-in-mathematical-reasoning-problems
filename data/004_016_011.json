    "message_2": "According to the Mean Value Theorem, if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we have a car traveling from point A to point B in 2 hours with an average speed of 60 mph. We can represent the position function of the car as s(t), where s is the distance traveled and t is the time in hours. The average speed is given by the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance traveled) / (Total time taken)\n\nSince the car travels with an average speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, the total distance traveled is:\n\nTotal distance = Average speed × Total time\nTotal distance = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, we can find the average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nAverage rate of change = (s(2) - s(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nSince the total distance traveled is 120 miles, we have:\n\ns(2) - s(0) = 120 miles\n\nSo, the average rate of change is:\n\nAverage rate of change = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 mph\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the position function s'(c) is equal to the average rate of change:\n\ns'(c) = 60 mph\n\nSince s'(t) represents the instantaneous speed of the car at time t, we can conclude that at some point during the journey, the car had an average speed of 60 mph."
