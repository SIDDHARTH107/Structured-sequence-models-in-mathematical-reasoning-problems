    "message_2": "To find the equation of the elliptic curve passing through the points (2,3) and (4,5) in the form of y² = x³ + Ax + B, we will plug in the coordinates of the points into the equation and solve for A and B.\n\nFor point (2,3):\n3² = 2³ + 2A + B\n9 = 8 + 2A + B\n\nFor point (4,5):\n5² = 4³ + 4A + B\n25 = 64 + 4A + B\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n1) 9 = 8 + 2A + B\n2) 25 = 64 + 4A + B\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. We will first eliminate B by subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(25 - 9) = (64 - 8) + (4A - 2A)\n16 = 56 + 2A\n\nNow, solve for A:\n2A = -40\nA = -20\n\nNow that we have the value of A, we can plug it back into equation 1 to find the value of B:\n\n9 = 8 + 2(-20) + B\n9 = 8 - 40 + B\nB = 41\n\nNow we have the values of A and B, we can write the equation of the elliptic curve:\n\ny² = x³ - 20x + 41"
