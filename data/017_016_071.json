    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, we will show that G is generated by a single element, namely a.\n\nSince G is a group of order 27, by the Sylow theorems, we know that G is a p-group with p = 3 (since 27 = 3^3). In a p-group, the order of every element divides the order of the group. Thus, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, 9, or 27.\n\nWe are given that a is an element in G such that a is not the identity element, and the order of a is not 3. Therefore, the order of a must be either 9 or 27. \n\nCase 1: The order of a is 9.\nIn this case, the subgroup generated by a, denoted by ⟨a⟩, has 9 elements. Since the order of G is 27, there are 27 - 9 = 18 elements in G that are not in ⟨a⟩. Let b be an element in G that is not in ⟨a⟩. Since the order of every element in G divides the order of G, the order of b must be either 1, 3, 9, or 27. Since b is not in ⟨a⟩, the order of b cannot be 1 or 9. If the order of b is 27, then G is generated by b and is isomorphic to C27, which is what we want to prove. So, let's consider the case where the order of b is 3.\n\nNow, consider the set {ab | b is an element in G}. This set has 27 elements since the operation is closed and the elements are distinct (if ab = ac, then b = c by left cancellation). Moreover, for any element x in G, there exists b and c in G such that x = ab and a = ac. Then, x = ab = a(ac) = (aa)c = ac^3, which implies that x is in the set {ab | b is an element in G}. Therefore, the set {ab | b is an element in G} is equal to G.\n\nSince the order of a is 9 and the order of b is 3, the order of ab is lcm(9, 3) = 9. Thus, the set {ab | b is an element in G} is a subgroup of G of order 9. However, we have shown that this set is equal to G, which is a contradiction since the order of G is 27. Therefore, the order of b cannot be 3, and we have already shown that if the order of b is 27, then G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nCase 2: The order of a is 27.\nIn this case, G is generated by a, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27."
