    "message_1": "A delivery company has to transport packages from four different locations, labeled A, B, C, and D, to a central factory. The distances between the locations are as follows:\n\n- A to B: 8 units\n- A to C: 10 units\n- A to D: 12 units\n- B to C: 4 units\n- B to D: 6 units\n- C to D: 3 units\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the company's delivery vehicles to take to minimize the total distance traveled when picking up all the packages? Assume that the vehicles can carry all the packages at once and can visit each location only once.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the nearest neighbor algorithm. Starting from location A, we will visit the nearest unvisited location and continue this process until all locations have been visited.\n\n1. Start at location A.\n2. The nearest unvisited location to A is B (8 units). Go to B.\n3. The nearest unvisited location to B is C (4 units). Go to C.\n4. The nearest unvisited location to C is D (3 units). Go to D.\n\nThe optimal route is A → B → C → D, with a total distance of 8 + 4 + 3 = 15 units."
