    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx for the given implicit function x^2 + y^2 = 25, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (y^2) = d/dx (25)\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\n\ndy/dx = -2x / 2y\n\nNow, we are given that x = 3. We need to find the corresponding value of y. We can do this by plugging x = 3 back into the original equation:\n\n(3)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\n9 + y^2 = 25\n\ny^2 = 16\n\ny = Â±4\n\nThere are two possible values for y: 4 and -4. Now we can find the value of dy/dx for both cases:\n\nCase 1: y = 4\ndy/dx = -2(3) / 2(4) = -6 / 8 = -3/4\n\nCase 2: y = -4\ndy/dx = -2(3) / 2(-4) = -6 / -8 = 3/4\n\nSo, there are two possible values for dy/dx when x = 3: -3/4 and 3/4."
