    "message_2": "The given temporal logic formula is:\n\np -> <>q\n\nThis formula can be read as \"if p holds, then eventually q holds.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the given sequence of states:\n\ns1: p = true\ns2: p = false, q = true\n\nIn state s1, p holds (p = true). According to the formula, if p holds, then eventually q should hold. In the next state, s2, q holds (q = true). Therefore, the formula becomes true at state s1, as it satisfies the condition \"if p holds, then eventually q holds.\""
