    "message_1": "Suppose you have a moduli space of algebraic curves of genus $g = 3$ over the field $\\mathbb{C}$. Let $S$ denote the smooth locus of this moduli space, that is, the subset consisting of only curves whose automorphism groups are trivial. Find the dimension of $S$.",
    "message_2": "The moduli space of algebraic curves of genus g is denoted by M_g. The dimension of M_g can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3\n\nIn our case, the genus g is 3, so we have:\n\ndim(M_3) = 3 * 3 - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6\n\nNow, we want to find the dimension of the smooth locus S, which consists of curves with trivial automorphism groups. For a curve of genus 3, the automorphism group can be trivial, cyclic of order 2, or cyclic of order 3. The locus of curves with non-trivial automorphism groups has codimension at least 1 in M_3. Therefore, the dimension of the smooth locus S is:\n\ndim(S) = dim(M_3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\n\nSo, the dimension of the smooth locus S of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 3 over the field â„‚ is 5."
