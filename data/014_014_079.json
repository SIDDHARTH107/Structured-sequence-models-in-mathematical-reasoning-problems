    "message_2": "To encrypt the word \"CRYPTO\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHEMATICS\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid using the key and the English alphabet (excluding the letter 'J', which is usually combined with 'I').\n\n2. Remove duplicate letters from the key and fill the grid with the remaining letters of the alphabet.\n\n3. Split the plaintext into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them.\n\n4. For each pair of letters, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n   a. If the letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their immediate right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   b. If the letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n   c. If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle.\n\nHere's the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. Key: MATHEMATICS (remove duplicate letters: MATHEICS)\n   Grid:\n   ```\n   M A T H E\n   I C S B F\n   G K L N O\n   P Q R U V\n   W X Y Z D\n   ```\n\n2. Plaintext: CRYPTO (split into pairs: CR YP TO)\n\n3. Encrypt each pair:\n   - CR: C is in row 2, column 2; R is in row 4, column 3. They form a rectangle. So, replace C with the letter in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle (I), and replace R with the letter in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle (T). The encrypted pair is IT.\n   - YP: Y is in row 5, column 3; P is in row 4, column 1. They form a rectangle. So, replace Y with the letter in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle (Z), and replace P with the letter in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle (G). The encrypted pair is ZG.\n   - TO: T is in row 1, column 3; O is in row 3, column 5. They form a rectangle. So, replace T with the letter in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle (E), and replace O with the letter in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle (N). The encrypted pair is EN.\n\n4. Combine the encrypted pairs: ITZGEN\n\nSo, the Playfair cipher encryption result of the word \"CRYPTO\" using the key \"MATHEMATICS\" is \"ITZGEN\"."
