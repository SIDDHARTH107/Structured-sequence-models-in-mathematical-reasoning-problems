    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we need to minimize the arc length between the two points (1, 1) and (3, 5). The arc length of a curve on a surface can be found using the following formula:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 + (∂z/∂y)^2) ds\n\nwhere L is the arc length, and s is the parameter along the curve. First, we need to find the partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we can substitute these into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (2x)^2 + (2y)^2) ds\n\nTo minimize this arc length, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations. Let's define the Lagrangian function L(x, y, x', y'):\n\nL(x, y, x', y') = √(1 + (2x)^2 + (2y)^2)\n\nwhere x' = dx/ds and y' = dy/ds. The Euler-Lagrange equations for x and y are:\n\n∂L/∂x - d/ds(∂L/∂x') = 0\n∂L/∂y - d/ds(∂L/∂y') = 0\n\nWe can find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, x', y, and y':\n\n∂L/∂x = (4x)/√(1 + 4x^2 + 4y^2)\n∂L/∂x' = 0\n∂L/∂y = (4y)/√(1 + 4x^2 + 4y^2)\n∂L/∂y' = 0\n\nSince ∂L/∂x' and ∂L/∂y' are both zero, the Euler-Lagrange equations simplify to:\n\n∂L/∂x = 0\n∂L/∂y = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n4x = 0\n4y = 0\n\nx = 0\ny = 0\n\nHowever, these solutions correspond to the trivial case where the curve is a single point. To find the geodesic curve connecting the points (1, 1) and (3, 5), we need to consider the boundary conditions. Since the problem is symmetric with respect to x and y, we can assume that the geodesic curve lies in the plane x = y. In this case, the surface equation becomes:\n\nz = 2x^2\n\nNow, we can find the arc length of the curve on this surface:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (4x)^2) ds\n\nTo minimize this arc length, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation for x:\n\n∂L/∂x - d/ds(∂L/∂x') = 0\n\nWe can find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x and x':\n\n∂L/∂x = (8x)/√(1 + 16x^2)\n∂L/∂x' = 0\n\nSince ∂L/∂x' is zero, the Euler-Lagrange equation simplifies to:\n\n∂L/∂x = 0\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\n8x = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nAgain, this solution corresponds to the trivial case. However, since we assumed that the geodesic curve lies in the plane x = y, the curve must be a straight line connecting the points (1, 1) and (3, 5). Therefore, the geodesic curve on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 that connects the points (1, 1) and (3, 5) with the shortest distance is the straight line x = y."
