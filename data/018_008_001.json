    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartesian products A x B and B x A, we need to find all possible ordered pairs where the first element is from set A and the second element is from set B, and vice versa.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. For example, (1, 3) ∈ A x B, but (1, 3) ∉ B x A. Similarly, (3, 1) ∈ B x A, but (3, 1) ∉ A x B.\n\nTherefore, A x B ≠ B x A, which proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
