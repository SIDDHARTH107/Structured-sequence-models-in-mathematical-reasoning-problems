    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 9)/(x - 3) as x approaches 3, we can first try to simplify the function. Notice that the numerator can be factored as a difference of squares:\n\nx^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)\n\nSo, the function can be rewritten as:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 3)(x + 3))/(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the (x - 3) terms in the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(x) = x + 3\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 3:\n\nlim (x -> 3) (x + 3) = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 9)/(x - 3) as x approaches 3 is 6."
