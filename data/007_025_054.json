    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, we first need to calculate the public keys for Alice and Bob.\n\nAlice's public key (A) can be calculated as follows:\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 5^6 mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 8\n\nBob's public key (B) can be calculated as follows:\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 5^11 mod 23\nB = 48828125 mod 23\nB = 10\n\nNow, we can calculate the shared secret key (S) using Alice's secret number (a) and Bob's public key (B) or Bob's secret number (b) and Alice's public key (A). Both methods will yield the same result.\n\nMethod 1: Using Alice's secret number and Bob's public key\nS = B^a mod p\nS = 10^6 mod 23\nS = 1000000 mod 23\nS = 2\n\nMethod 2: Using Bob's secret number and Alice's public key\nS = A^b mod p\nS = 8^11 mod 23\nS = 8587340257 mod 23\nS = 2\n\nThe shared secret key they can use in their secure communication is 2."
