    "message_2": "To find the value of F(256,128), we need to know the values of the image pixels f(x,y). Since we don't have the actual image, we cannot compute the exact value of F(256,128). However, I can explain the process to calculate it if you had the image.\n\n1. Set N = 512, u = 256, and v = 128.\n2. Initialize F(256,128) to 0.\n3. Iterate through x from 0 to N-1 (0 to 511) and y from 0 to N-1 (0 to 511).\n4. For each (x,y) pair, get the pixel value f(x,y) from the image.\n5. Calculate the complex exponential term: e^(-2πi(ux/N + vy/N)).\n6. Multiply f(x,y) by the complex exponential term and add the result to F(256,128).\n7. After iterating through all x and y values, divide F(256,128) by N^2 (512^2 = 262144).\n\nThe final value of F(256,128) would be the Fourier transform of the image at the point (256,128)."
