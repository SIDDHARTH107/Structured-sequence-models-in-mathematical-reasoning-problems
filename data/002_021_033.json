    "message_2": "To calculate the area of a sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r^2\n\nwhere the central angle is given in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is half of that:\n\nr = Diameter / 2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × (10 cm)^2\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 100 cm^2\nArea of sector = (100π/6) cm^2\nArea of sector ≈ 52.36 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the sector with a central angle of 60 degrees in a circle with a diameter of 20 cm is approximately 52.36 cm^2."
