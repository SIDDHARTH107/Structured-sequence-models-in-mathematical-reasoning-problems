The probability of failure for the components are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 respectively. What is the probability that at least 2 components will fail within a given period of time of using the system?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 components will fail, we can first find the probability that none or only one component will fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of each case:\n\n1. No component fails:\nThe probability of a component not failing is (1 - probability of failure). So, for each component, the probabilities of not failing are 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5. Since the components fail independently, we can multiply these probabilities together to find the probability that none of them fail:\n\nP(None fail) = 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.1512\n\n2. Only one component fails:\nWe will find the probability of each component failing while the others do not fail, and then sum these probabilities. \n\nP(1 fails) = (0.1 * 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.6 * 0.5) + (0.9 * 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.6 * 0.5) + (0.9 * 0.8 * 0.3 * 0.6 * 0.5) + (0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.4 * 0.5) + (0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.6 * 0.5)\nP(1 fails) = 0.1008 + 0.1512 + 0.1512 + 0.1512 + 0.1512 = 0.7056\n\nNow, we will find the probability that at least 2 components fail by subtracting the probabilities of the other cases from 1:\n\nP(At least 2 fail) = 1 - P(None fail) - P(1 fails) = 1 - 0.1512 - 0.7056 = 0.1432\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 components will fail within a given period of time of using the system is 0.1432 or 14.32%."
