    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve: \n\nSuppose we have a region in the complex plane with a boundary consisting of the unit circle $|z|=1$ and the interval $[-1,1]$ on the real axis. Using the Riemann mapping theorem, find a conformal map that takes this region to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}\\mid\\mathrm{Im}(z)>0\\}$. \n\nOnce you have found the conformal map, use it to determine the images of the points $i$ and $-i$ under this transformation.",
    "message_2": "To find a conformal map from the given region to the upper half-plane, we can use a series of transformations. Let's denote the given region as $\\Omega$. First, let's find a map that takes $\\Omega$ to the right half-plane.\n\n1. Consider the map $w_1 = z^2$. This map takes the unit circle to the circle of radius 1 centered at 1, and the interval $[-1,1]$ to the interval $[0,1]$. The region $\\Omega$ is mapped to the right half-plane minus the interval $[0,1]$.\n\n2. Now consider the map $w_2 = w_1 - 1$. This map translates the region obtained in step 1 to the left by 1 unit, so the interval $[0,1]$ is mapped to the interval $[-1,0]$. The region is now the right half-plane minus the interval $[-1,0]$.\n\n3. Finally, consider the map $w_3 = \\frac{1}{w_2}$. This map takes the right half-plane minus the interval $[-1,0]$ to the upper half-plane. To see this, note that the right half-plane is mapped to the region inside the unit circle, and the interval $[-1,0]$ is mapped to the interval $[1,\\infty)$ on the real axis. Thus, the region is the upper half-plane.\n\nNow, combining these maps, we have the conformal map $w = \\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}$. To find the images of the points $i$ and $-i$, we simply plug them into the map:\n\n$w(i) = \\frac{1}{i^2 - 1} = \\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$w(-i) = \\frac{1}{(-i)^2 - 1} = \\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, both $i$ and $-i$ are mapped to $-\\frac{1}{2}$ under this conformal map."
