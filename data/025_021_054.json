They also consider the mirror curve, which is given by the equation $y^3+3xy^2+x^3=0$. \n\nQuestion: Find the number of rational points on the elliptic curve and on its mirror curve over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ (the field of rational numbers).",
    "message_2": "To find the number of rational points on the elliptic curve and its mirror curve over the field of rational numbers, we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem, which states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated. However, finding the actual number of rational points can be quite challenging.\n\nFor the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + x$, we can use a technique called \"2-descent\" to find the rank of the curve. The rank of an elliptic curve is the number of independent generators of the group of rational points. In this case, the rank is 0, which means that the group of rational points is a finite group.\n\nNow, we need to find the torsion points on the elliptic curve. Torsion points are points that have finite order in the group of rational points. In this case, we can find the torsion points by looking for rational solutions to the equation $y^2 = x^3 + x$. We can factor the right-hand side as $x(x^2 + 1)$. This gives us three possibilities for rational solutions:\n\n1. $x = 0$: This gives us the point $(0, 0)$.\n2. $x^2 + 1 = 0$: This equation has no rational solutions, as $x^2 + 1 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n3. $x(x^2 + 1) = 0$: This equation is satisfied by the point $(0, 0)$, which we already found.\n\nThus, the elliptic curve has only one rational point: $(0, 0)$.\n\nFor the mirror curve $y^3 + 3xy^2 + x^3 = 0$, it is not an elliptic curve, so we cannot apply the Mordell-Weil theorem directly. However, we can try to find rational points on the curve by looking for rational solutions to the equation.\n\nFirst, notice that if $x = 0$, then the equation becomes $y^3 = 0$, which has the rational solution $y = 0$. This gives us the point $(0, 0)$ on the mirror curve.\n\nNow, suppose $x \\neq 0$. We can divide both sides of the equation by $x^3$ to get:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^3 + 3\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2 + 1 = 0$$\n\nLet $t = \\frac{y}{x}$. Then the equation becomes:\n\n$$t^3 + 3t^2 + 1 = 0$$\n\nThis is a cubic equation in $t$, and it is not easy to find rational solutions directly. However, we can use a result from number theory called the Rational Root Theorem, which states that if a polynomial with integer coefficients has a rational root, then that root must be of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ divides the constant term and $q$ divides the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 1, so the only possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$. However, neither of these values satisfy the equation:\n\n$$(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 + 1 = -1 + 3 + 1 = 3 \\neq 0$$\n$$(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 \\neq 0$$\n\nThus, the cubic equation has no rational solutions, and the only rational point on the mirror curve is $(0, 0)$.\n\nIn conclusion, both the elliptic curve and its mirror curve have only one rational point over the field of rational numbers: $(0, 0)$."
