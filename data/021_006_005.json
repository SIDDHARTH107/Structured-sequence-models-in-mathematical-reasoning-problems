    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation:\n\n∇ · (k∇u) = f\n\nwhere k = 2, u(x,y) is the solution, and f = 5x - 7y. Suppose we want to solve this equation on the unit square [0,1]x[0,1] using linear Lagrange elements with a mesh size of h = 0.25. \n\nWhat is the numerical solution of the equation, u_h(x,y), using the finite element method?",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the finite element method with linear Lagrange elements, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain: Since we are given the mesh size h = 0.25, we will have a 4x4 grid on the unit square [0,1]x[0,1]. There will be 16 elements and 25 nodes in total.\n\n2. Define the basis functions: For linear Lagrange elements, the basis functions are defined as:\n\nϕ_i(x,y) = 1 at node i and 0 at all other nodes.\n\n3. Formulate the weak form of the equation: Multiply the given equation by a test function v(x,y) and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫∫(k∇u · ∇v) dxdy = ∫∫(fv) dxdy\n\n4. Substitute the numerical solution u_h(x,y) = ΣU_iϕ_i(x,y) and apply the Galerkin method:\n\nΣU_i ∫∫(k∇ϕ_i · ∇ϕ_j) dxdy = ∫∫(fϕ_j) dxdy, for all j.\n\n5. Assemble the global stiffness matrix K and load vector F:\n\nK_ij = ∫∫(k∇ϕ_i · ∇ϕ_j) dxdy, F_j = ∫∫(fϕ_j) dxdy\n\n6. Solve the linear system KU = F for the unknown coefficients U.\n\n7. Compute the numerical solution u_h(x,y) = ΣU_iϕ_i(x,y).\n\nHowever, to provide the exact numerical solution, we need more information, such as boundary conditions. The finite element method requires boundary conditions to solve the linear system KU = F. If you can provide the boundary conditions, we can proceed with the solution."
