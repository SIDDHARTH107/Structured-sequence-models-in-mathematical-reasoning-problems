    "message_2": "Using linear logic, we can set up the problem as follows:\n\nTotal apples (A) = 4\nNumber of friends (F) = 2\n\nWe want to find the number of apples each friend should get (X).\n\nA = F * X\n\nNow, we can solve for X:\n\n4 = 2 * X\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nX = 4 / 2\n\nX = 2\n\nSo, each friend should get 2 apples."
