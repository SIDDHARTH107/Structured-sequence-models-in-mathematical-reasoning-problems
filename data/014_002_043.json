    "message_2": "In a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the shared secret key can be calculated using the following steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret key, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret key.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as S_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as S_B = A^b mod p.\n5. If the protocol is executed correctly, S_A and S_B should be equal, and this value is the shared secret key.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key using the given values:\n\n1. A = 2^3 mod 19 = 8 mod 19 = 8\n2. B = 2^5 mod 19 = 32 mod 19 = 13\n3. S_A = 13^3 mod 19 = 2197 mod 19 = 10\n4. S_B = 8^5 mod 19 = 32768 mod 19 = 10\n\nSince S_A and S_B are equal, the shared secret key is 10."
