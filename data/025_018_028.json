    "message_2": "Mori theory is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry, but it is not the most suitable method for this particular problem. Instead, we can find the singular points of the curve by looking for points where the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z are all zero.\n\nThe given equation is $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$. Let's find the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3xyz) = 2x - 3yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3xyz) = 2y - 3xz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3xyz) = 2z - 3xy$\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$2x - 3yz = 0$\n\n$2y - 3xz = 0$\n\n$2z - 3xy = 0$\n\nIf x = 0, then from the second equation, y = 0 or z = 0. Similarly, if y = 0, then x = 0 or z = 0, and if z = 0, then x = 0 or y = 0. Thus, we have the following solutions: (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, z), (0, y, 0), and (x, 0, 0).\n\nNow, let's assume that none of x, y, and z are zero. Then we can divide the first equation by x, the second by y, and the third by z:\n\n$\\frac{2x - 3yz}{x} = 2 - 3\\frac{yz}{x} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{2y - 3xz}{y} = 2 - 3\\frac{xz}{y} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{2z - 3xy}{z} = 2 - 3\\frac{xy}{z} = 0$\n\nFrom these equations, we have:\n\n$\\frac{yz}{x} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$\\frac{xz}{y} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$\\frac{xy}{z} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nMultiplying these three equations, we get:\n\n$\\frac{x^2y^2z^2}{xyz} = \\frac{8}{27}$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$xyz = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\nNow, substituting this back into the original equation:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)$\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8$\n\nHowever, this equation represents a sphere in 3-dimensional space, not a curve. Since we assumed that none of x, y, and z are zero, there are no singular points on this sphere.\n\nTherefore, the only singular point on the curve is (0, 0, 0). So, there is only 1 singular point on the curve."
