    "message_2": "A simplicial complex is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Every face of a simplex in the complex is also in the complex.\n2. The intersection of any two simplices in the complex is a face of both of them.\n\nIn this problem, we have a simplicial complex with 5 vertices and 10 edges. To find the maximum possible number of faces, we need to consider the highest-dimensional simplices that can be formed with these vertices and edges.\n\nA 2-simplex (triangle) is formed by 3 vertices and 3 edges. Since each edge is shared between exactly 2 vertices, we can form a triangle by choosing any 3 vertices and their corresponding edges. \n\nLet's denote the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E. We can form the following triangles:\n\n1. ABC (with edges AB, BC, and AC)\n2. ABD (with edges AB, BD, and AD)\n3. ABE (with edges AB, BE, and AE)\n4. ACD (with edges AC, CD, and AD)\n5. ACE (with edges AC, CE, and AE)\n6. ADE (with edges AD, DE, and AE)\n7. BCD (with edges BC, CD, and BD)\n8. BCE (with edges BC, CE, and BE)\n9. BDE (with edges BD, DE, and BE)\n10. CDE (with edges CD, DE, and CE)\n\nWe can form a maximum of 10 triangles (2-simplices) using the given vertices and edges. Now, we need to count the total number of faces in this simplicial complex, including the 0-simplices (vertices), 1-simplices (edges), and 2-simplices (triangles).\n\n- There are 5 vertices (0-simplices).\n- There are 10 edges (1-simplices).\n- There are 10 triangles (2-simplices).\n\nSo, the maximum possible number of faces in this simplicial complex is 5 + 10 + 10 = 25."
