    "message_2": "To find the geodesic between two points on the surface of a sphere, we need to find the shortest path between the points along the surface of the sphere. In this case, the sphere has a radius of 4, and we are given the points (3, 0, 0) and (0, 4, 0).\n\nFirst, let's convert the Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates. The spherical coordinates are given by (r, θ, φ), where r is the radial distance, θ is the polar angle (angle from the positive z-axis), and φ is the azimuthal angle (angle from the positive x-axis).\n\nFor point (3, 0, 0):\nr₁ = 4 (since it's on the sphere's surface)\nθ₁ = arccos(z₁/r₁) = arccos(0/4) = π/2\nφ₁ = atan2(y₁, x₁) = atan2(0, 3) = 0\n\nSo, the spherical coordinates for point (3, 0, 0) are (4, π/2, 0).\n\nFor point (0, 4, 0):\nr₂ = 4 (since it's on the sphere's surface)\nθ₂ = arccos(z₂/r₂) = arccos(0/4) = π/2\nφ₂ = atan2(y₂, x₂) = atan2(4, 0) = π/2\n\nSo, the spherical coordinates for point (0, 4, 0) are (4, π/2, π/2).\n\nNow, we can find the geodesic distance between the two points using the spherical distance formula:\n\nd = r * arccos(sin(θ₁) * sin(θ₂) * cos(φ₁ - φ₂) + cos(θ₁) * cos(θ₂))\n\nIn our case:\n\nd = 4 * arccos(sin(π/2) * sin(π/2) * cos(0 - π/2) + cos(π/2) * cos(π/2))\nd = 4 * arccos(1 * 1 * 0 + 0 * 0)\nd = 4 * arccos(0)\nd = 4 * π/2\nd = 2π\n\nSo, the geodesic distance between the two points is 2π.\n\nTo find the geodesic path, we can parameterize the path in terms of the spherical coordinates. Since both points have the same polar angle (θ = π/2), the geodesic path will lie in the plane defined by θ = π/2. The azimuthal angle φ will vary between 0 and π/2.\n\nThe geodesic path can be described as:\n\nr(t) = 4\nθ(t) = π/2\nφ(t) = t * π/2, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1\n\nSo, the geodesic path between the points (3, 0, 0) and (0, 4, 0) on the surface of the sphere with radius 4 is parameterized by the spherical coordinates (4, π/2, t * π/2) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1."
