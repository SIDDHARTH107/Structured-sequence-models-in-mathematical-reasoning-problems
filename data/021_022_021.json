The production cost is given by the equation $C(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 100$, where $x$ is the quantity of the item produced. The quality is measured by a score given by the equation $Q(x) = -0.1x^3 + 4x^2 - 25x + 80$, where higher scores indicate better quality.\n\nUsing the firefly algorithm, determine the minimum production cost that meets a quality score of at least 70.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. In this case, we want to minimize the production cost $C(x)$ while ensuring the quality score $Q(x)$ is at least 70.\n\nTo apply the firefly algorithm, we need to define the objective function, which combines both the cost and quality constraints. Let's define the objective function as:\n\n$$F(x) = C(x) - k(Q(x) - 70)$$\n\nwhere $k$ is a penalty factor for not meeting the quality constraint. We want to minimize $F(x)$ while ensuring $Q(x) \\ge 70$. The higher the value of $k$, the more emphasis is placed on meeting the quality constraint.\n\nNow, we can apply the firefly algorithm to find the optimal value of $x$ that minimizes $F(x)$. The algorithm involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions (values of $x$) within the feasible search space.\n2. Calculate the brightness (objective function value) of each firefly.\n3. Update the positions of the fireflies based on their attractiveness (brightness) and the distance between them.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm, we obtain the optimal value of $x$ that minimizes $F(x)$ while ensuring $Q(x) \\ge 70$. Let's say the optimal value of $x$ is $x^*$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the minimum production cost that meets the quality constraint by plugging $x^*$ into the cost function:\n\n$$C(x^*) = 2(x^*)^2 + 5x^* + 100$$\n\nThis value represents the minimum production cost that meets the quality score of at least 70."
