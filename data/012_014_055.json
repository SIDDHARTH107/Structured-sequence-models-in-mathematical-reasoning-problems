    "message_2": "To determine if the graphs G and H are isomorphic, we can first compare their degree sequences. If the degree sequences are not the same, then the graphs are not isomorphic. If the degree sequences are the same, we can then try to find a permutation of the vertices that maps G to H.\n\nDegree sequence of G:\nDegree of vertex 1: 2\nDegree of vertex 2: 2\nDegree of vertex 3: 2\nDegree of vertex 4: 2\n\nDegree sequence of H:\nDegree of vertex 1: 2\nDegree of vertex 2: 2\nDegree of vertex 3: 2\nDegree of vertex 4: 2\n\nThe degree sequences are the same, so we can proceed to find a permutation of the vertices that maps G to H.\n\nLet's try the following permutation:\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 3\n3 -> 2\n4 -> 4\n\nApplying this permutation to the adjacency matrix of G, we get:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n->\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nThis permutation does not result in the adjacency matrix of H. However, we can try another permutation:\n\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 4\n3 -> 2\n4 -> 3\n\nApplying this permutation to the adjacency matrix of G, we get:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n->\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nThis permutation results in the adjacency matrix of H. Therefore, the graphs G and H are isomorphic."
