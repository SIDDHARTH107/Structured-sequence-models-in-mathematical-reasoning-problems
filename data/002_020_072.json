    "message_1": "A circular pizza with a diameter of 18 inches is cut into a sector with a central angle of 75 degrees. What is the perimeter of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza:\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 18 inches / 2 = 9 inches\n\nNext, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\nArc length (L) = (Central angle / 360) * 2 * π * r\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 75 degrees, and the radius is 9 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nL = (75 / 360) * 2 * π * 9\nL ≈ (0.2083) * 18π\nL ≈ 3.75π\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter of the sector. The perimeter (P) is the sum of the arc length and the two radii:\nP = L + 2r\nP ≈ 3.75π + 2(9)\nP ≈ 3.75π + 18\n\nTo get an approximate value for the perimeter, we can use the value of π ≈ 3.14:\nP ≈ 3.75 * 3.14 + 18\nP ≈ 11.775 + 18\nP ≈ 29.775 inches\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 29.775 inches."
