The initial temperature of the rod is given by T(x,0) = 50 sin(πx), where x is the position along the rod. \n\nDetermine the temperature distribution T(x,t) at time t = 10 seconds, and the heat flux across a section of the rod located at x = 0.5 meter.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = k * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and k is the thermal diffusivity. For a metal rod with a thermal conductivity of 100 W/m°C, we need to find the thermal diffusivity. The thermal diffusivity (α) is related to the thermal conductivity (K), density (ρ), and specific heat capacity (c) by the following equation:\n\nα = K / (ρ * c)\n\nAssuming the metal rod is made of aluminum, we have the following properties:\n- Thermal conductivity (K) = 100 W/m°C\n- Density (ρ) = 2700 kg/m³\n- Specific heat capacity (c) = 900 J/kg°C\n\nNow, we can find the thermal diffusivity (α):\n\nα = 100 / (2700 * 900) = 100 / 2430000 = 1/24300 m²/s\n\nNow, we can solve the heat equation using the given initial condition T(x,0) = 50 sin(πx) and boundary conditions T(0,t) = 0°C and T(1,t) = 100°C. Since the problem involves a sinusoidal initial condition and constant boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables to find the solution. \n\nLet T(x,t) = X(x) * T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = α * X''(x) * T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by α * X(x) * T(t):\n\nT'(t) / (α * T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT'(t) / (α * T(t)) = -λ²\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) X''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\n2) T'(t) + αλ²T(t) = 0\n\nThe general solution for equation (1) is:\n\nX(x) = A * cos(λx) + B * sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0, we get:\n\n0 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) => A = 0\n0 = B * sin(λ)\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(λ) = 0. This implies that λ = nπ, where n is an integer. So, the solution for X(x) becomes:\n\nX(x) = B * sin(nπx)\n\nNow, let's solve equation (2). This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, and its general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C * e^(-αλ²t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for T(x,t) as:\n\nT(x,t) = ∑[C_n * sin(nπx) * e^(-αn²π²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition T(x,0) = 50 sin(πx):\n\n50 sin(πx) = ∑[C_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nComparing both sides, we can see that C_1 = 50 and all other coefficients C_n = 0 for n > 1. So, the solution for T(x,t) is:\n\nT(x,t) = 50 * sin(πx) * e^(-απ²t)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution T(x,t) at time t = 10 seconds:\n\nT(x,10) = 50 * sin(πx) * e^(-απ²*10)\n\nTo find the heat flux across a section of the rod located at x = 0.5 meter, we use Fourier's law:\n\nq(x) = -K * ∂T/∂x\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of T(x,t) with respect to x:\n\n∂T/∂x = 50 * π * cos(πx) * e^(-απ²t)\n\nNow, we can find the heat flux at x = 0.5 and t = 10:\n\nq(0.5, 10) = -100 * [50 * π * cos(π * 0.5) * e^(-απ²*10)]\nq(0.5, 10) = -100 * [50 * π * cos(π/2) * e^(-απ²*10)]\nq(0.5, 10) = -100 * [50 * π * 0 * e^(-απ²*10)]\nq(0.5, 10) = 0 W/m²\n\nSo, the heat flux across a section of the rod located at x = 0.5 meter at time t = 10 seconds is 0 W/m²."
