    "message_2": "To find the solutions to the equation sin(x) = 0.5 in the interval [0, 2π], we need to find the angles x for which the sine function equals 0.5.\n\nWe know that sin(π/6) = 0.5 and sin(5π/6) = 0.5. These are the two angles in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy the equation sin(x) = 0.5.\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation sin(x) = 0.5 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = π/6 and x = 5π/6."
