    "message_1": "Suppose you want to distribute 10 identical candies among 4 children. In how many ways can you do this if each child can get any number of candies? Use Pascal's triangle to find the solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's triangle, we can use the concept of stars and bars. We have 10 candies (stars) and we need to divide them among 4 children. To do this, we can use 3 bars to separate the candies into 4 groups.\n\nFor example, if we have the arrangement:\n\n**|***|*|***\n\nThis represents giving 2 candies to the first child, 3 candies to the second child, 1 candy to the third child, and 3 candies to the fourth child.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these 10 stars and 3 bars. This is equivalent to choosing 3 positions for the bars among the 13 positions (10 stars + 3 bars).\n\nUsing Pascal's triangle, we can find the number of combinations by looking at the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(n, k) = C(13, 3)\n\nLooking at the 14th row (since Pascal's triangle starts with row 0) and the 4th element (since we start counting from 0), we get:\n\nC(13, 3) = 286\n\nSo there are 286 ways to distribute 10 identical candies among 4 children if each child can get any number of candies."
