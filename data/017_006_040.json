    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35 = 5 * 7. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1. \n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they are both normal in G. Let P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, where a and b are the generators of P and Q, respectively.\n\nNow, consider the element ab in G. Since P and Q are normal in G, we have (ab)^5 = a^5b^5 = e, where e is the identity element in G. Similarly, (ab)^7 = a^7b^7 = e. Thus, the order of ab divides both 5 and 7, which are prime numbers. Therefore, the order of ab must be 1, which implies that ab = e. This means that a and b commute, i.e., ab = ba.\n\nSince G has order 35, by the counting formula, we have |G| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q are cyclic groups of prime order, their intersection must be trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}. Therefore, |G| = |P||Q| = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nNow, we can define a homomorphism φ: P × Q → G by φ(a^i, b^j) = a^i * b^j. Since a and b commute, this map is well-defined. It is also easy to see that φ is a group homomorphism. Moreover, φ is surjective, as every element in G can be written as a product of powers of a and b.\n\nFinally, we show that φ is injective. Suppose φ(a^i, b^j) = e. Then a^i * b^j = e. Since a and b commute, we have a^i = b^(-j). But a^i ∈ P and b^(-j) ∈ Q, and since P ∩ Q = {e}, we must have a^i = b^(-j) = e. Thus, (a^i, b^j) is the identity element in P × Q, and φ is injective.\n\nSince φ is a bijective group homomorphism, we have that G is isomorphic to P × Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7. Therefore, G is either cyclic (if P × Q is cyclic) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
