    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nIn a Stackelberg competition, Firm A is the leader and Firm B is the follower. The inverse demand function for the market is given by P = 300 - 3Q where P is the market price and Q is the total quantity produced in the market. Firm A has a cost function of C(A) = 20Qa while Firm B's cost function is C(B) = 30Qb. If Firm A chooses its output level first and Firm B observes it before choosing its own output level to maximize its profit, what will be the quantity of output produced by each firm and the resulting market price?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction function for Firm B (the follower).\n2. Find the optimal output for Firm A (the leader) by taking into account Firm B's reaction function.\n3. Calculate the market price based on the total quantity produced.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for Firm B\n\nFirm B's profit function is given by:\n\nπ(B) = P * Qb - C(B)\n\nSubstitute the inverse demand function and the cost function of Firm B:\n\nπ(B) = (300 - 3(Qa + Qb)) * Qb - 30Qb\n\nTo find the reaction function, we need to maximize Firm B's profit with respect to its output Qb. To do this, we will take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to Qb and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ(B)/dQb = -3Qb² - 6QaQb + 270Qb - 30Qa - 270 = 0\n\nNow, solve for Qb in terms of Qa:\n\nQb = (30Qa + 270) / 3\n\nStep 2: Find the optimal output for Firm A\n\nFirm A's profit function is given by:\n\nπ(A) = P * Qa - C(A)\n\nSubstitute the inverse demand function and the cost function of Firm A:\n\nπ(A) = (300 - 3(Qa + Qb)) * Qa - 20Qa\n\nNow, substitute Firm B's reaction function into the profit function of Firm A:\n\nπ(A) = (300 - 3(Qa + (30Qa + 270) / 3)) * Qa - 20Qa\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nπ(A) = (300 - Qa - 30Qa - 270) * Qa - 20Qa\n\nπ(A) = (-31Qa + 30) * Qa - 20Qa\n\nTo find the optimal output for Firm A, we need to maximize its profit with respect to its output Qa. To do this, we will take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to Qa and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ(A)/dQa = -62Qa + 30 - 20 = 0\n\nSolve for Qa:\n\nQa = 50 / 62 = 25 / 31\n\nStep 3: Calculate the market price based on the total quantity produced\n\nNow that we have the optimal output for Firm A, we can find the optimal output for Firm B using its reaction function:\n\nQb = (30(25 / 31) + 270) / 3 = (750 + 8370) / 93 = 90 / 31\n\nThe total quantity produced in the market is:\n\nQ = Qa + Qb = 25 / 31 + 90 / 31 = 115 / 31\n\nNow, we can find the market price using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 300 - 3Q = 300 - 3(115 / 31) = 300 - 345 / 31 = (9300 - 345) / 31 = 8955 / 31\n\nSo, the quantity of output produced by Firm A is 25/31, the quantity of output produced by Firm B is 90/31, and the resulting market price is 8955/31."
