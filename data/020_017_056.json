    "message_1": "A metal sheet of length 10 cm and width 20 cm needs to be folded along its length to form a rectangular box with an open top. What should be the dimensions of the box such that its volume is maximum?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the box as L, the width as W, and the height as H. Since the metal sheet is folded along its length, the length of the box will remain 10 cm (L = 10 cm). The width of the box will be equal to the width of the metal sheet minus twice the height (W = 20 - 2H).\n\nThe volume of the box can be calculated as V = L * W * H. Substituting the expressions for L and W, we get:\n\nV = 10 * (20 - 2H) * H = 200H - 20H^2\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the volume function with respect to H and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndV/dH = 200 - 40H = 0\n\nSolving for H:\n\n40H = 200\nH = 5 cm\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point corresponds to a maximum volume. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative of the volume function:\n\nd^2V/dH^2 = -40\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point corresponds to a maximum volume.\n\nNow, we can find the width of the box:\n\nW = 20 - 2H = 20 - 2(5) = 10 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will maximize its volume are:\n\nLength (L) = 10 cm\nWidth (W) = 10 cm\nHeight (H) = 5 cm"
