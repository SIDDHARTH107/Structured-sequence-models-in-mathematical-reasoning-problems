    "message_2": "To calculate the degree of $K_X + D$, we first need to find the canonical divisor $K_X$. For a nonsingular projective plane curve given by the equation $F(x, y, z) = 0$, the canonical divisor is given by $K_X = (d-3)H$, where $d$ is the degree of the curve and $H$ is a hyperplane section.\n\nIn our case, the curve X is given by the equation $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$. The degree of this curve is the highest total degree of any monomial term, which is 3 (from the term $y^2z$). Therefore, $d = 3$.\n\nNow we can find the canonical divisor $K_X = (d-3)H = (3-3)H = 0$.\n\nSince we are given that $\\deg(D) = 3$, we can now calculate the degree of $K_X + D$:\n\n$\\deg(K_X + D) = \\deg(K_X) + \\deg(D) = 0 + 3 = 3$."
