    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. If the dimensions of the prism are length (l), width (w), and height (h), the formula for the diagonal (d) is:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nIn this case, the dimensions are 8 cm x 10 cm x 15 cm, so we have:\n\nd = √(8² + 10² + 15²)\nd = √(64 + 100 + 225)\nd = √(389)\n\nThe length of the diagonal is approximately 19.72 cm."
