    "message_1": "On a stretch of road, accidents occur following a Poisson distribution at a rate of 0.5 accidents per day. What is the probability that there will be no accidents on that road in the next 2 days?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of no accidents in the next 2 days, we can use the Poisson probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-位) * 位^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of accidents, k is the desired number of accidents (in this case, 0), 位 is the average rate of accidents (0.5 accidents per day), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nSince we want to find the probability of no accidents in 2 days, we need to adjust the rate 位 to account for the 2-day period. The rate for 2 days would be 0.5 accidents/day * 2 days = 1 accident.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-1) * 1^0) / 0!\n\nP(X = 0) = (0.3679 * 1) / 1\n\nP(X = 0) = 0.3679\n\nTherefore, the probability that there will be no accidents on that road in the next 2 days is approximately 36.79%."
