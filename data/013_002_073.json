    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium of this game, we need to identify the strategies where no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nLet's analyze the strategies for both players:\n\n1. If Player 1 swerves and Player 2 swerves, the payoff is (-1, -1).\n2. If Player 1 swerves and Player 2 stays, the payoff is (2, 0).\n3. If Player 1 stays and Player 2 swerves, the payoff is (0, 2).\n4. If Player 1 stays and Player 2 stays, the payoff is (-10, -10).\n\nNow let's check for Nash equilibrium:\n\n1. In the case of both players swerving, Player 1 can improve their payoff by staying (2 > -1), and Player 2 can improve their payoff by staying (0 > -1). So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n\n2. In the case of Player 1 swerving and Player 2 staying, Player 1 cannot improve their payoff by staying (-10 < 2), but Player 2 can improve their payoff by swerving (2 > 0). So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n\n3. In the case of Player 1 staying and Player 2 swerving, Player 1 can improve their payoff by swerving (2 > 0), but Player 2 cannot improve their payoff by staying (0 < 2). So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n\n4. In the case of both players staying, Player 1 can improve their payoff by swerving (2 > -10), and Player 2 can improve their payoff by swerving (2 > -10). So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n\nThere is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game. However, there can be a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where players choose their strategies with certain probabilities.\n\nLet p be the probability that Player 1 swerves, and q be the probability that Player 2 swerves. Then, the expected payoffs for each player are as follows:\n\nExpected payoff for Player 1:\n- Swerving: -1 * q + 2 * (1 - q)\n- Staying: 0 * q - 10 * (1 - q)\n\nExpected payoff for Player 2:\n- Swerving: -1 * p + 2 * (1 - p)\n- Staying: 0 * p - 10 * (1 - p)\n\nTo find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to find the probabilities p and q such that neither player has an incentive to change their strategy.\n\nFor Player 1, the expected payoffs for swerving and staying should be equal:\n\n-1 * q + 2 * (1 - q) = 0 * q - 10 * (1 - q)\n\nSolving for q, we get:\n\nq = 2/3\n\nFor Player 2, the expected payoffs for swerving and staying should be equal:\n\n-1 * p + 2 * (1 - p) = 0 * p - 10 * (1 - p)\n\nSolving for p, we get:\n\np = 2/3\n\nSo, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is when both players swerve with a probability of 2/3 and stay with a probability of 1/3."
