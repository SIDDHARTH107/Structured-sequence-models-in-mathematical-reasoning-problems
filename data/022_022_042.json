    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of f(z) with respect to x, we first need to rewrite f(z) in terms of x and y. Since z = x + iy, we have:\n\nf(z) = (x + iy)^2 + 3(x + iy) - 1\n     = (x^2 + 2ixy - y^2) + 3x + 3iy - 1\n     = (x^2 - y^2 + 3x - 1) + i(2xy + 3y)\n\nNow, let's denote the real part of f(z) as u(x, y) and the imaginary part as v(x, y):\n\nu(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 + 3x - 1\nv(x, y) = 2xy + 3y\n\nThe Fourier transform of a complex-valued function is given by the Fourier transform of its real and imaginary parts separately. Let F_u(k) and F_v(k) be the Fourier transforms of u(x, y) and v(x, y) with respect to x, respectively. Then, the Fourier transform of f(z) with respect to x is given by:\n\nF_f(k) = F_u(k) + iF_v(k)\n\nTo find F_u(k) and F_v(k), we need to compute the Fourier transforms of u(x, y) and v(x, y):\n\nF_u(k) = ∫[u(x, y) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\nF_v(k) = ∫[v(x, y) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nNow, we compute the Fourier transforms:\n\nF_u(k) = ∫[(x^2 - y^2 + 3x - 1) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\nF_v(k) = ∫[(2xy + 3y) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nThese integrals are difficult to solve analytically. However, you can compute them numerically using software like MATLAB or Python's NumPy library. Once you have the numerical values for F_u(k) and F_v(k), you can find the Fourier transform of f(z) with respect to x:\n\nF_f(k) = F_u(k) + iF_v(k)"
