We have the following system of linear equations:\n\n(2 - √13)x - 2y = 0\n4x - (2 + √13)y = 0\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second equation:\n\n(4 - 2√13)x - 4y = 0\n4x - (4 - 2√13)y = 0\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n2√13y = 0\n\nSince we want a non-zero eigenvector, we can set y = 1. Then, x = (2 - √13). So, the eigenvector v1 is:\n\nv1 = [2 - √13, 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 1 - √13:\n\n(A - λ2I) = [[3 - (1 - √13), -2], [4, -1 - (1 - √13)]] = [[2 + √13, -2], [4, -2 + √13]]\n\nLet the eigenvector be v2 = [x, y]. We have the following system of linear equations:\n\n(2 + √13)x - 2y = 0\n4x - (2 - √13)y = 0\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second equation:\n\n(4 + 2√13)x - 4y = 0\n4x - (4 + 2√13)y = 0\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n-2√13y = 0\n\nSince we want a non-zero eigenvector, we can set y = 1. Then, x = (2 + √13). So, the eigenvector v2 is:\n\nv2 = [2 + √13, 1]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 1 + √13, Eigenvector v1 = [2 - √13, 1]\nEigenvalue λ2 = 1 - √13, Eigenvector v2 = [2 + √13, 1]"
