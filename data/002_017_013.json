    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by the number of triangles (6).\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal in length, so each side of the triangle is also 10 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length of 10 cm:\n\nArea = (10² * √3) / 4\nArea = (100 * √3) / 4\nArea = 25 * √3\n\nSo, the area of one equilateral triangle is 25√3 square centimeters.\n\nSince there are 6 equilateral triangles in a regular hexagon, we multiply the area of one triangle by 6:\n\nTotal area = 6 * (25 * √3)\nTotal area = 150 * √3\n\nTherefore, the area of the regular hexagon is 150√3 square centimeters."
