    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to produce two products, product A and product B, with the following production costs:\n\n- $50 per unit of product A\n- $70 per unit of product B\n\nThe company has a budget of $20,000 for production costs and wants to produce at least 200 units of product A and 100 units of product B. Additionally, the company wants to maximize its profit by selling the products at the following prices:\n\n- $100 per unit of product A\n- $120 per unit of product B\n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce in order to maximize its profit? Use multi-objective optimization to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 50y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Production cost constraint: 50x + 70y ≤ 20,000\n2. Minimum production constraint for product A: x ≥ 200\n3. Minimum production constraint for product B: y ≥ 100\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints in the standard form:\n\n1. 50x + 70y ≤ 20,000\n2. x - 0y ≥ 200\n3. 0x + y ≥ 100\n\nNow, we'll graph these inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. y ≤ (20,000 - 50x) / 70\n2. x ≥ 200\n3. y ≥ 100\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points (200, 100), (200, 257.14), (280, 200), and (400, 100). To find the optimal solution, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 50y at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(200, 100) = 50(200) + 50(100) = 15,000\n2. P(200, 257.14) = 50(200) + 50(257.14) ≈ 22,857\n3. P(280, 200) = 50(280) + 50(200) = 24,000\n4. P(400, 100) = 50(400) + 50(100) = 25,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (400, 100), with a profit of $25,000. Therefore, the company should produce 400 units of product A and 100 units of product B to maximize its profit."
