    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = 3x^2 + 2x - 1 at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = d(3x^2 + 2x - 1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 6(2) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = 3x^2 + 2x - 1 at the point where x = 2 is 14."
