    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B, using two machines, X and Y. The production time for each unit of product A on machine X is 3 hours, on machine Y is 4 hours; the production time for each unit of product B on machine X is 2 hours, on machine Y is 5 hours. Machine X has 180 hours of production time available, and machine Y has 200 hours of production time available. The profit earned on each unit of product A is $10 and on each unit of product B is $8. What is the optimal production level of each product to maximize the total profit for the company?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production level of each product to maximize the total profit for the company, we can use linear programming. Let's define the variables:\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A produced.\nLet y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nP = 10x + 8y\n\nThe constraints are given by the available production time on machines X and Y:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 180 (Machine X constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 200 (Machine Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nNow we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and finding the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. 3x + 2y = 180\n   y = (180 - 3x)/2\n\n2. 4x + 5y = 200\n   y = (200 - 4x)/5\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of 3x + 2y = 180 and 4x + 5y = 200:\n\n   3x + 2(200 - 4x)/5 = 180\n   15x + 8(200 - 4x) = 900\n   15x + 1600 - 32x = 900\n   -17x = -700\n   x = 700/17 ≈ 41.18\n\n   y = (200 - 4(700/17))/5 ≈ 23.53\n\n2. Intersection of 3x + 2y = 180 and x = 0:\n\n   x = 0\n   y = 90\n\n3. Intersection of 4x + 5y = 200 and x = 0:\n\n   x = 0\n   y = 40\n\n4. Intersection of 3x + 2y = 180 and y = 0:\n\n   x = 60\n   y = 0\n\n5. Intersection of 4x + 5y = 200 and y = 0:\n\n   x = 50\n   y = 0\n\nNow we need to evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 8y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(41.18, 23.53) ≈ 10(41.18) + 8(23.53) ≈ 656.88\n2. P(0, 90) = 10(0) + 8(90) = 720\n3. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 8(40) = 320\n4. P(60, 0) = 10(60) + 8(0) = 600\n5. P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 8(0) = 500\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at the vertex (0, 90), with a total profit of $720. Therefore, the optimal production level is to produce 0 units of product A and 90 units of product B."
