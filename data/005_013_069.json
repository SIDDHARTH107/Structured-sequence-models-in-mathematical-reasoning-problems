    "message_1": "A company wants to analyze the sales data of its four different products, namely A, B, C, and D, for the past six months. The total number of units sold for each product is given below:\n\n- Product A: 500\n- Product B: 300\n- Product C: 400\n- Product D: 600\n\nThe company wants to know if there is any relationship between the sales of these products. Can you help the company by finding out the correlation matrix for this data?",
    "message_2": "To compute the correlation matrix, we need more information about the sales data for each product over the past six months. Specifically, we need the monthly sales data for each product. The correlation matrix will show the correlation coefficients between each pair of products, which will help us understand the relationship between their sales.\n\nPlease provide the monthly sales data for each product, and I will help you compute the correlation matrix."
