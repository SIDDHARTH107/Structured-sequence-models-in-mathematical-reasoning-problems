    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (the curved part of the cone) and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nArea of the base (circle) = π(5^2) = 25π cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area of the cone. To do this, we first need to find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height, as the cone forms a right triangle with the height (h) and radius (r) as the legs and the slant height (l) as the hypotenuse.\n\nh^2 + r^2 = l^2\n12^2 + 5^2 = l^2\n144 + 25 = l^2\n169 = l^2\nl = √169 = 13 cm\n\nNow that we have the slant height, we can find the lateral surface area using the formula:\n\nLateral surface area = πr * l\nLateral surface area = π(5)(13) = 65π cm^2\n\nFinally, we add the base area and the lateral surface area together to find the total surface area of the cone:\n\nSurface area = Base area + Lateral surface area\nSurface area = 25π + 65π = 90π cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is 90π cm^2."
