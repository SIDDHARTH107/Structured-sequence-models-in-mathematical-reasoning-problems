    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student studying Epistemic Logic:\n\nIn a game, Player 1 knows that the sum of two numbers is either 4 or 5, but doesn't know the numbers themselves. Player 2 knows the two numbers, but doesn't know if Player 1 knows them. If Player 1 says \"I don't know the numbers\", what are the two possible pairs of numbers that Player 2 could have?\n\nHint: Use epistemic logic to reason about what each player knows and doesn't know, and what they infer from each other's actions.",
    "message_2": "Let's list the possible pairs of numbers that sum up to 4 or 5:\n\nSum = 4:\n1. (1, 3)\n2. (2, 2)\n3. (3, 1)\n\nSum = 5:\n1. (1, 4)\n2. (2, 3)\n3. (3, 2)\n4. (4, 1)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation using epistemic logic.\n\nPlayer 1 knows that the sum is either 4 or 5 but doesn't know the numbers. If the sum were 4, there would be a unique pair with a repeated number: (2, 2). If Player 1 had been given the sum 4, they could have inferred that the pair was (2, 2) because it's the only pair with a repeated number. However, Player 1 says, \"I don't know the numbers,\" which means the sum cannot be 4.\n\nNow we know that the sum must be 5. Since Player 1 cannot determine the numbers, we can rule out any pairs with repeated numbers. In this case, there are no such pairs for the sum of 5.\n\nSo, the two possible pairs of numbers that Player 2 could have are:\n\n1. (1, 4)\n2. (2, 3)"
