    "message_1": "A student standing 20 meters away from the base of a building measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building to be 60 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (h), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the base of the building (20 meters).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 20\n\nTo find the height of the building, we need to find the value of tan(60°). We know that tan(60°) = √3.\n\n√3 = h / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 20 * √3\n\nh ≈ 20 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 34.64 meters\n\nThe height of the building is approximately 34.64 meters."
