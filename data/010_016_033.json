    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation step by step. We start with a closed orientable surface X of genus g with n holes. The Euler characteristic of X is given by the formula:\n\nχ(X) = 2 - 2g - n\n\nNow, we glue a disk to X along a simple closed curve in X. This operation is essentially cutting a hole in X and attaching a disk to it. Since we are attaching a disk, we are not changing the number of vertices or edges, but we are adding one face. So, the Euler characteristic of the resulting surface Y is:\n\nχ(Y) = χ(X) + 1 = (2 - 2g - n) + 1 = 3 - 2g - n\n\nNow, let's denote the genus of Y as g' and the number of holes as n'. We can write the Euler characteristic of Y in terms of g' and n':\n\nχ(Y) = 2 - 2g' - n'\n\nSince χ(Y) = 3 - 2g - n, we have:\n\n2 - 2g' - n' = 3 - 2g - n\n\nNow, let's solve for g' and n':\n\n2g' = 2g - 1\ng' = g - 1/2\n\nn' = n - 1\n\nHowever, the genus must be an integer, so the given problem has an inconsistency. It is not possible to glue a disk to a closed orientable surface of genus g with n holes and obtain a connected surface with an integer genus."
