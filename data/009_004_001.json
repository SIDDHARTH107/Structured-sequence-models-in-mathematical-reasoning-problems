What is the displacement equation of the system and what will be the displacement of the system after 2 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement equation of the system, we first need to determine the angular frequency (ω) of the system. The angular frequency can be found using the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (16 N/m) and m is the mass (1 kg).\n\nω = √(16/1) = 4 rad/s\n\nSince the system is undergoing undamped vibrations, we can use the following equation for the displacement (x) as a function of time (t):\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, t is the time, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nGiven that the initial displacement is 4 cm (0.04 m), we can determine the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ) as follows:\n\nAt t = 0, x(0) = 0.04 m\n0.04 = A * cos(φ)\n\nSince the system is initially at its maximum displacement, the phase angle (φ) is 0.\n\nA = 0.04 m\n\nNow we have all the information needed to write the displacement equation:\n\nx(t) = 0.04 * cos(4t)\n\nTo find the displacement of the system after 2 seconds, we can plug t = 2 into the equation:\n\nx(2) = 0.04 * cos(4 * 2)\nx(2) = 0.04 * cos(8)\n\nx(2) ≈ -0.04 m\n\nThe displacement of the system after 2 seconds is approximately -0.04 m or -4 cm."
