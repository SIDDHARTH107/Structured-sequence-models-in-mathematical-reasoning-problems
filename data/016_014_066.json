    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal that doubles the number of segments with each iteration. In the first iteration, there are 2 segments, and with each subsequent iteration, the number of segments doubles.\n\nTo find the maximum number of copies in the 4th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of copies = 2^(iteration - 1)\n\nFor the 4th iteration:\n\nNumber of copies = 2^(4 - 1) = 2^3 = 8\n\nSo, the maximum number of copies that can be made in the 4th iteration of the Lévy C curve is 8."
