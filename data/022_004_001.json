    "message_2": "(a) To determine the singularities of f(z), we first need to find the points where the denominator of the function is equal to zero. The denominator is given by (z - 2)(z + 1)^2. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n(z - 2)(z + 1)^2 = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: z = 2 and z = -1. \n\nNow, we need to determine the types of these singularities. Since the denominator has a linear factor (z - 2) and a quadratic factor (z + 1)^2, we can conclude that:\n\n- z = 2 is a simple pole (first-order pole) because the factor (z - 2) has an exponent of 1.\n- z = -1 is a pole of order 2 (second-order pole) because the factor (z + 1)^2 has an exponent of 2.\n\n(b) To compute the residues of f(z) at each isolated singularity, we can use the following formulas:\n\n- For a simple pole at z = z0, the residue is given by the limit as z approaches z0 of (z - z0) * f(z).\n- For a pole of order m at z = z0, the residue is given by the (m-1)-th derivative of (z - z0)^m * f(z) evaluated at z = z0, divided by (m-1) factorial.\n\nFor the simple pole at z = 2:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> 2) [(z - 2) * (3z^2 + 6z - 15)/((z - 2)(z + 1)^2)]\nResidue = lim (z -> 2) [(3z^2 + 6z - 15)/((z + 1)^2)]\nResidue = (3(2)^2 + 6(2) - 15)/((2 + 1)^2) = (12 + 12 - 15)/(3^2) = 9/9 = 1\n\nFor the pole of order 2 at z = -1:\n\nFirst, we need to compute the first derivative of (z + 1)^2 * f(z):\n\ng(z) = (z + 1)^2 * (3z^2 + 6z - 15)/((z - 2)(z + 1)^2)\ng(z) = (3z^2 + 6z - 15)/(z - 2)\n\ng'(z) = d/dz [(3z^2 + 6z - 15)/(z - 2)]\ng'(z) = [(6z + 6)(z - 2) - (3z^2 + 6z - 15)]/((z - 2)^2)\ng'(z) = [(6z + 6)(z - 2) - 3z^2 - 6z + 15]/((z - 2)^2)\ng'(z) = (6z^2 - 12z + 6z - 12 - 3z^2 + 15)/((z - 2)^2)\ng'(z) = (3z^2 - 12)/((z - 2)^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the residue at z = -1:\n\nResidue = g'(-1) = (3(-1)^2 - 12)/((-1 - 2)^2) = (3 - 12)/(3^2) = -9/9 = -1\n\nIn conclusion, the residues of f(z) at its isolated singularities are:\n\n- Residue at z = 2: 1\n- Residue at z = -1: -1"
