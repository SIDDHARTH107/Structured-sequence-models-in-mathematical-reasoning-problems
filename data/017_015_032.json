    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the Sylow theorems and consider the possible Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. \n\nLet G be a group of order 24. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. So n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. So n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow we consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P of order 8 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q of order 3. Both P and Q are normal in G, and their intersection is trivial. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product P x Q, which is either Z_8 x Z_3 or Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_3. Since Z_8 x Z_3 and Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_3 are not isomorphic, we have two non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P of order 8, which is normal in G. However, there are four 3-Sylow subgroups, none of which are normal. The semi-direct product of P and one of the 3-Sylow subgroups gives a non-abelian group of order 24. The only possibility is the semi-direct product of Z_8 and Z_3, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_12. So we have one non-isomorphic group in this case.\n\n3. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups, none of which are normal. However, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q of order 3, which is normal in G. The semi-direct product of one of the 2-Sylow subgroups and Q gives a non-abelian group of order 24. The only possibility is the semi-direct product of Z_4 x Z_2 and Z_3, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_4. So we have one non-isomorphic group in this case.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups, none of which are normal. There is no non-isomorphic group in this case, as the conditions for a semi-direct product are not met.\n\nIn total, we have found 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 24:\n\n1. Z_8 x Z_3\n2. Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_3\n3. D_12 (dihedral group of order 12)\n4. S_4 (symmetric group on 4 elements)"
