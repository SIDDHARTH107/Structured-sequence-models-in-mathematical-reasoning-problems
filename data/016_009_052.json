    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that can be created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the Dragon curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the Dragon curve, the perimeter at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial length * (sqrt(2))^iteration\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter of the 6th iteration.\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (sqrt(2))^6\nPerimeter ≈ 1 * 4.242640687\nPerimeter ≈ 4.242640687 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 6th iteration of the Dragon curve is approximately 4.242640687 units."
