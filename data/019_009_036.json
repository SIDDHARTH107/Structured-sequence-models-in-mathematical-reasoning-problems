    "message_2": "To prove the statement (A → (B → C)) → ((A → B) → (A → C)) in intuitionistic logic, we will use a proof technique called \"proof by assumption\" or \"conditional proof\". We will assume the antecedent (A → (B → C)) and show that the consequent ((A → B) → (A → C)) follows.\n\n1. Assume (A → (B → C)).\n\nNow, we want to show that ((A → B) → (A → C)) follows. To do this, we will again use proof by assumption.\n\n2. Assume (A → B).\n\nOur goal now is to show that (A → C) follows. Once more, we will use proof by assumption.\n\n3. Assume A.\n\nNow, we have the following assumptions:\n\n1. A → (B → C)\n2. A → B\n3. A\n\nFrom assumptions 1 and 3, we can apply the modus ponens rule to obtain:\n\n4. B → C (from 1 and 3)\n\nFrom assumptions 2 and 3, we can apply the modus ponens rule to obtain:\n\n5. B (from 2 and 3)\n\nNow, from 4 and 5, we can apply the modus ponens rule again to obtain:\n\n6. C (from 4 and 5)\n\nSince we derived C from the assumption A, we can conclude:\n\n7. A → C (from 3 to 6)\n\nNow, we have shown that (A → C) follows from the assumption (A → B). Therefore, we can conclude:\n\n8. (A → B) → (A → C) (from 2 to 7)\n\nFinally, we have shown that ((A → B) → (A → C)) follows from the assumption (A → (B → C)). Therefore, we can conclude:\n\n9. (A → (B → C)) → ((A → B) → (A → C)) (from 1 to 8)\n\nThus, the statement (A → (B → C)) → ((A → B) → (A → C)) is true for any values of A, B, and C in intuitionistic logic."
