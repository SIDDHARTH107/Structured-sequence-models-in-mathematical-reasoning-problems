    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example of an optimization problem related to optimal portfolio selection:\n\nSuppose a math student wants to select the optimal mix of two stocks from a list of three stocks. The expected return and standard deviation of each stock are given as follows:\n\nStock A: Expected Return = 8%, Standard Deviation = 12%\nStock B: Expected Return = 10%, Standard Deviation = 20%\nStock C: Expected Return = 12%, Standard Deviation = 15%\n\nThe student has $10,000 to invest and wants to maximize the expected return while keeping the risk (as measured by the standard deviation) below 16%. How should the student allocate their $10,000 investment between the two stocks to achieve this goal?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the expected return and standard deviation for each possible pair of stocks. Then, we will find the optimal allocation for each pair that keeps the risk below 16%. Finally, we will select the pair with the highest expected return.\n\nPairs of stocks:\n1. Stock A and Stock B\n2. Stock A and Stock C\n3. Stock B and Stock C\n\n1. Stock A and Stock B:\nLet x be the proportion of investment in Stock A and (1-x) be the proportion of investment in Stock B.\n\nExpected Return: R = 8%x + 10%(1-x)\nStandard Deviation: σ = sqrt((12%^2)x^2 + (20%^2)(1-x)^2 + 2 * 0 * x * (1-x))\n\nWe want to maximize R while keeping σ ≤ 16%. To find the optimal allocation, we can use trial and error or a solver tool. In this case, we find that x ≈ 0.685 and (1-x) ≈ 0.315. This allocation gives an expected return of R ≈ 8.6% and a standard deviation of σ ≈ 16%.\n\n2. Stock A and Stock C:\nLet x be the proportion of investment in Stock A and (1-x) be the proportion of investment in Stock C.\n\nExpected Return: R = 8%x + 12%(1-x)\nStandard Deviation: σ = sqrt((12%^2)x^2 + (15%^2)(1-x)^2 + 2 * 0 * x * (1-x))\n\nUsing trial and error or a solver tool, we find that x ≈ 0.571 and (1-x) ≈ 0.429. This allocation gives an expected return of R ≈ 10.0% and a standard deviation of σ ≈ 16%.\n\n3. Stock B and Stock C:\nLet x be the proportion of investment in Stock B and (1-x) be the proportion of investment in Stock C.\n\nExpected Return: R = 10%x + 12%(1-x)\nStandard Deviation: σ = sqrt((20%^2)x^2 + (15%^2)(1-x)^2 + 2 * 0 * x * (1-x))\n\nUsing trial and error or a solver tool, we find that x ≈ 0.444 and (1-x) ≈ 0.556. This allocation gives an expected return of R ≈ 10.8% and a standard deviation of σ ≈ 16%.\n\nComparing the three pairs, the optimal allocation is to invest in Stock B and Stock C with proportions of 44.4% and 55.6%, respectively. This gives the highest expected return of 10.8% while keeping the risk below 16%.\n\nTherefore, the student should invest $4,440 in Stock B and $5,560 in Stock C."
