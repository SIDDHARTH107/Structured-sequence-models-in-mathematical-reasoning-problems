    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. To produce one unit of Product A, the company requires 2 units of Material X and 5 units of Material Y. To produce one unit of Product B, the company requires 4 units of Material X and 3 units of Material Y. The company has 60 units of Material X and 45 units of Material Y available for production. If the profit per unit of Product A is $10 and profit per unit of Product B is $8, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the materials are:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 60 (Material X constraint)\n5x + 3y ≤ 45 (Material Y constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 8y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Rearrange the Material X constraint equation:\n\ny ≤ (60 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ 15 - 0.5x\n\n2. Rearrange the Material Y constraint equation:\n\ny ≤ (45 - 5x) / 3\ny ≤ 15 - 5x/3\n\nNow we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of Material X and Material Y constraint lines:\n\n15 - 0.5x = 15 - 5x/3\n(5/6)x = 0\nx = 0\n\ny = 15 - 0.5(0) = 15\n\nSo, the first corner point is (0, 15).\n\n2. Intersection of Material X constraint line with x-axis (y = 0):\n\n0 = 15 - 0.5x\nx = 30\n\nSo, the second corner point is (30, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of Material Y constraint line with x-axis (y = 0):\n\n0 = 15 - 5x/3\n5x/3 = 15\nx = 9\n\nSo, the third corner point is (9, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 8y at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 15) = 10(0) + 8(15) = $120\n2. P(30, 0) = 10(30) + 8(0) = $300\n3. P(9, 0) = 10(9) + 8(0) = $90\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the corner point (30, 0), with a profit of $300. Therefore, the company should produce 30 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize its profit."
