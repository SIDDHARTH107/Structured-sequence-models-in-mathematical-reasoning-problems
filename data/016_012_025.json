    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. The first iteration of the Peano curve has a length of 3 units, as it consists of three segments, each of length 1.\n\nIn the second iteration, each segment of the first iteration is replaced by a smaller version of the entire first iteration curve, scaled down by a factor of 3. Since there are three segments in the first iteration, and each segment is replaced by a smaller version of the first iteration curve, the length of the second iteration of the Peano curve is 3 times the length of the first iteration curve.\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve after two iterations is:\n\n3 * (length of the first iteration curve) = 3 * 3 = 9 units."
