    "message_1": "Let A = {2, 3, 7, 9} and B = {3, 6, 8, 9}. Find the complements of sets A and B, then calculate the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and the complement of (A ∪ B) for the given sets. Show that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "To find the complements of sets A and B, we first need to define the universal set U. Since no specific universal set is given, we can assume that the universal set U contains all the elements in sets A and B. Therefore, U = {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nNow, we can find the complements of sets A and B:\n\nA' (complement of A) = U - A = {6, 8}\nB' (complement of B) = U - B = {2, 7}\n\nNext, we will calculate the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both:\n\nA Δ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {2, 7} ∪ {6, 8} = {2, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, we will find the complement of the union of sets A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n(A ∪ B)' = U - (A ∪ B) = {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9} - {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9} = {}\n\nNow, we will show that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement. If it were distributive, then the following equation would hold:\n\n(A Δ B)' = A' Δ B'\n\nLet's calculate the right side of the equation:\n\nA' Δ B' = (A' - B') ∪ (B' - A') = {6, 8} ∪ {2, 7} = {2, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sides of the equation:\n\n(A Δ B)' = {}\nA' Δ B' = {2, 6, 7, 8}\n\nSince (A Δ B)' ≠ A' Δ B', the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
