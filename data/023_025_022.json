    "message_1": "A material has a density function f(x) = 10x (where x is in meters) for -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. What is the total mass of the material?",
    "message_2": "To find the total mass of the material, we need to integrate the density function over the given interval [-1, 1]. The mass can be found using the following formula:\n\nMass = ∫[f(x) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 10x. So, we need to integrate 10x with respect to x from -1 to 1:\n\nMass = ∫[10x dx] from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we find the antiderivative of 10x:\n\nAntiderivative of 10x = 5x^2 + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\nMass = (5(1)^2 - 5(-1)^2) = 5(1) - 5(1) = 5 - 5 = 0\n\nThe total mass of the material is 0."
