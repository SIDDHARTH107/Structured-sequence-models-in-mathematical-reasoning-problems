    "message_2": "To find the probability that it will rain during at least 2 of the activities, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rain) in n trials (activities)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) in a single trial (activity)\n- n is the number of trials (activities)\n- k is the number of successes (rain) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 5 (number of activities)\n- p = 0.4 (40% chance of rain)\n\nWe want to find the probability that it will rain during at least 2 of the activities, so we need to find the probability for k = 2, 3, 4, and 5, and then sum these probabilities.\n\nP(X >= 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\n\nCalculating each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * 0.4^2 * 0.6^3 = 10 * 0.16 * 0.216 = 0.3456\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.4^3 * 0.6^2 = 10 * 0.064 * 0.36 = 0.2304\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.4^4 * 0.6^1 = 5 * 0.0256 * 0.6 = 0.0768\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * 0.4^5 * 0.6^0 = 1 * 0.01024 * 1 = 0.01024\n\nNow, summing these probabilities:\n\nP(X >= 2) = 0.3456 + 0.2304 + 0.0768 + 0.01024 = 0.66304\n\nSo, there is a 66.304% chance that it will rain during at least 2 of the 5 activities."
