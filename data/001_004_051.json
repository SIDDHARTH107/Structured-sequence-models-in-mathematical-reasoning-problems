    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 3x^2 + 10x + 8 = 0 by factoring, we need to find two binomials that multiply to give the quadratic equation.\n\nStep 1: Multiply the leading coefficient (3) and the constant term (8).\n3 * 8 = 24\n\nStep 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 24 and add to the middle coefficient (10).\nThese two numbers are 6 and 4, since 6 * 4 = 24 and 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nStep 3: Rewrite the middle term (10x) using the two numbers found in step 2.\n3x^2 + 6x + 4x + 8 = 0\n\nStep 4: Factor by grouping.\nGroup the first two terms and the last two terms separately:\n(3x^2 + 6x) + (4x + 8) = 0\n\nFactor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group:\n3x(x + 2) + 4(x + 2) = 0\n\nStep 5: Factor out the common binomial (x + 2).\n(3x + 4)(x + 2) = 0\n\nStep 6: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.\n3x + 4 = 0 and x + 2 = 0\n\nFor 3x + 4 = 0:\n3x = -4\nx = -4/3\n\nFor x + 2 = 0:\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions for the quadratic equation 3x^2 + 10x + 8 = 0 are x = -4/3 and x = -2."
