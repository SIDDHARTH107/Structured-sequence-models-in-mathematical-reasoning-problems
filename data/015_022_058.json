    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a delay differential equation that models physiological control systems and is given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = βx(t-τ) / (1 + x(t-τ)^n) - γx(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the state variable, β, γ, τ, and n are positive constants, and t is time. The equation exhibits chaotic behavior for certain parameter values.\n\nThe order of the bifurcation at a specific value of r (in this case, r = 158.5) cannot be directly determined without more information about the system, such as the values of β, γ, τ, and n. However, the Mackey-Glass equation is known to exhibit chaotic behavior for certain parameter values, particularly when τ is large.\n\nTo determine the order of the bifurcation, one would typically perform a bifurcation analysis by varying the parameter r and analyzing the stability of the fixed points and periodic orbits of the system. This can be done using numerical methods, such as continuation methods, to trace the bifurcation diagram.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the specific parameter values for the Mackey-Glass equation, it is not possible to determine the order of the bifurcation at r = 158.5."
