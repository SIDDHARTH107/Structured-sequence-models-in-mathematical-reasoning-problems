    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\nThe area of the first pair of opposite faces (length × width) is:\n2 × (5 cm × 3 cm) = 2 × 15 cm² = 30 cm²\n\nThe area of the second pair of opposite faces (length × height) is:\n2 × (5 cm × 4 cm) = 2 × 20 cm² = 40 cm²\n\nThe area of the third pair of opposite faces (width × height) is:\n2 × (3 cm × 4 cm) = 2 × 12 cm² = 24 cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together to find the total surface area:\n30 cm² + 40 cm² + 24 cm² = 94 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 94 square centimeters."
