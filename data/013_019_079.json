    "message_1": "Here's a possible numerical problem on Cheap Talk in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose two players, Adam and Bob, are trying to divide a sum of $100 between them. Neither player knows how much the other values the money. Before the game starts, they can have a conversation, but no binding agreements are allowed; that is, they can say anything they want, but they can't commit to a division in advance. If they fail to reach an agreement, the money will be evenly split. Let's assume that the players are rational and selfish, meaning they want to maximize their own share of the money.\n\n1. If Adam proposes to take $70 and Bob proposes to take $30, what are the expected payoffs of each player, and will they agree to the proposal?\n2. If Adam proposes to take $51 and Bob proposes to take $49, what are the expected payoffs of each player, and will they agree to the proposal?\n3. Is there any way for Adam to offer Bob less than $50 and still get some positive payoff?",
    "message_2": "1. If Adam proposes to take $70 and Bob proposes to take $30, the expected payoffs for each player would be $70 for Adam and $30 for Bob. However, since both players are rational and selfish, Bob would likely not agree to this proposal, as he would receive more ($50) if they fail to reach an agreement and the money is split evenly.\n\n2. If Adam proposes to take $51 and Bob proposes to take $49, the expected payoffs for each player would be $51 for Adam and $49 for Bob. In this case, both players might agree to the proposal, as they are both receiving close to an even split of the money, and the difference between the proposed amounts and the even split is relatively small. However, Bob might still try to negotiate for a higher amount, as he would receive $50 if they fail to reach an agreement.\n\n3. It would be difficult for Adam to offer Bob less than $50 and still get some positive payoff, as Bob would likely reject any proposal that gives him less than $50, knowing that he would receive $50 if they fail to reach an agreement. However, if Adam can convince Bob that accepting a slightly smaller amount (e.g., $49) is in his best interest due to some external factor or future cooperation, then it might be possible for Adam to offer Bob less than $50 and still get some positive payoff. This would heavily depend on the specific context and the relationship between the players."
