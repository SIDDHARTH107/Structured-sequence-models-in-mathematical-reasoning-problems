    "message_2": "To find the inflection point(s) of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 4, we need to find the second derivative of the function and then solve for x when the second derivative is equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection point(s), we need to solve f''(x) = 0:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the inflection point, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging x back into the original function f(x):\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) + 4\nf(2) = 8 - 24 + 18 + 4\nf(2) = 6\n\nSo, the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 4 is (2, 6)."
