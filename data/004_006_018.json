    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x² - 8x + 15, we first need to find its first derivative f'(x) and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nf(x) = x² - 8x + 15\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 8\n\nNow, set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - 8 = 0\n2x = 8\nx = 4\n\nSo, there is one critical point at x = 4.\n\nTo determine whether this critical point is a maximum, minimum, or point of inflection, we need to analyze the second derivative f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince f''(x) is a constant and greater than zero, it means that the function is concave up everywhere. Therefore, the critical point at x = 4 is a minimum.\n\nSo, the function f(x) = x² - 8x + 15 has a minimum at the critical point x = 4."
