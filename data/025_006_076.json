    "message_2": "To show that $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D))$ is finite-dimensional, we can use the fact that $\\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is ample. By definition, an ample line bundle on a projective variety has the property that some positive tensor power of it is generated by its global sections. In other words, for some positive integer $n$, the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_X(nD)$ is generated by its global sections. This implies that $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(nD))$ is finite-dimensional for some $n > 0$. Since $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D))$ is a subspace of $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(nD))$, it must also be finite-dimensional.\n\nNow let's compute $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D))$ for $X$ given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$ with the restriction of the hyperplane class. In this case, $D$ is the restriction of the hyperplane class to $X$, so $\\mathcal{O}_X(D) = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. We want to find the global sections of this line bundle.\n\nRecall that global sections of $\\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ correspond to homogeneous polynomials of degree 1 in the coordinates $x, y, z$. In this case, we have three such polynomials: $x, y, z$. However, we need to restrict these polynomials to the equation of $X$, which is $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$. Since this equation is homogeneous of degree 2, it does not affect the linear polynomials $x, y, z$. Therefore, the global sections of $\\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ are given by the linear polynomials $x, y, z$, and we have:\n\n$$H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(D)) = \\langle x, y, z \\rangle$$\n\nThis is a 3-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$."
