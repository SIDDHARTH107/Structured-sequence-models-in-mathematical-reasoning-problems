    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance along a geodesic path on the surface of a sphere, we can use the great-circle distance formula. The great-circle distance is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, and it is the path that a particle would travel along a geodesic.\n\nThe great-circle distance formula is given by:\n\nd = r * arccos(sin(θ1) * sin(θ2) + cos(θ1) * cos(θ2) * cos(Δλ))\n\nwhere d is the great-circle distance, r is the radius of the sphere, θ1 and θ2 are the latitudes of the two points, and Δλ is the difference in longitude between the two points.\n\nHowever, we are given the linear distance between the two points (1.7 units) and need to find the great-circle distance. We can use the spherical law of cosines to relate the linear distance to the angular distance:\n\ncos(γ) = cos(90° - θ1) * cos(90° - θ2) + sin(90° - θ1) * sin(90° - θ2) * cos(Δλ)\n\nSince we don't have the specific coordinates of the two points, we can use the relationship between the linear distance, the radius of the sphere, and the angular distance:\n\nlinear distance = r * angular distance\n\nwhere the angular distance is in radians. We can rearrange this equation to find the angular distance:\n\nangular distance = linear distance / r\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nangular distance = 1.7 / 2.5 ≈ 0.68 radians\n\nFinally, we can find the great-circle distance by multiplying the angular distance by the radius of the sphere:\n\ngreat-circle distance = 2.5 * 0.68 ≈ 1.7 units\n\nSo, the shortest distance a particle can travel between two points that are 1.7 units apart on the surface of a sphere of radius 2.5 is approximately 1.7 units."
