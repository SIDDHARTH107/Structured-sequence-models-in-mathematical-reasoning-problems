    "message_1": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a precise numerical problem for paraconsistent logic as it deals with logical systems in which contradictions are allowed. Paraconsistent logic is concerned with reasoning in situations where there may be inconsistent or conflicting information. Therefore, questions related to paraconsistent logic may involve analyzing logical systems in which contradictions arise or determining the consequences of accepting contradictory premises. If you would like, I can suggest a more general question related to paraconsistent logic.",
