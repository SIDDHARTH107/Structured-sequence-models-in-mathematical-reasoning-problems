The data is given below:\n\n| Person | Height | Weight |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1      | 68     | 165    |\n| 2      | 72     | 183    |\n| 3      | 70     | 170    |\n| 4      | 69     | 175    |\n| 5      | 73     | 181    |\n| 6      | 68     | 160    |\n| 7      | 67     | 165    |\n| 8      | 71     | 185    |\n| 9      | 69     | 177    |\n| 10     | 74     | 190    |\n\nThe student wants to determine if there is a relationship between height and weight. The student decides to use multivariate analysis to look for any correlation between the two variables. \n\nWhat is the correlation coefficient between height and weight for these ten people?",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient between height and weight, we will use the Pearson correlation coefficient formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / sqrt(Σ(xi - x̄)^2 * Σ(yi - ȳ)^2)\n\nwhere r is the correlation coefficient, xi and yi are the individual height and weight data points, and x̄ and ȳ are the mean height and weight, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean height (x̄) and mean weight (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (68 + 72 + 70 + 69 + 73 + 68 + 67 + 71 + 69 + 74) / 10 = 701 / 10 = 70.1 inches\nȳ = (165 + 183 + 170 + 175 + 181 + 160 + 165 + 185 + 177 + 190) / 10 = 1751 / 10 = 175.1 pounds\n\nNow, let's calculate the terms for the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nΣ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = (68-70.1)(165-175.1) + (72-70.1)(183-175.1) + ... + (74-70.1)(190-175.1)\n= (-2.1)(-10.1) + (1.9)(7.9) + ... + (3.9)(14.9)\n= 21.21 + 15.01 + ... + 58.11\n= 211.59\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)^2 = (-2.1)^2 + (1.9)^2 + ... + (3.9)^2\n= 4.41 + 3.61 + ... + 15.21\n= 50.39\n\nΣ(yi - ȳ)^2 = (-10.1)^2 + (7.9)^2 + ... + (14.9)^2\n= 102.01 + 62.41 + ... + 222.01\n= 1045.19\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = 211.59 / sqrt(50.39 * 1045.19)\nr ≈ 211.59 / sqrt(52684.97)\nr ≈ 211.59 / 229.53\nr ≈ 0.922\n\nThe correlation coefficient between height and weight for these ten people is approximately 0.922, which indicates a strong positive correlation between the two variables."
