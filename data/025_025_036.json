    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve from Noncommutative algebraic geometry and its applications:\n\nLet A be the noncommutative algebra generated by x, y subject to the relations xy - qyx = 1, where q is a nonzero scalar. Determine whether or not A is an integral domain. If A is an integral domain, find its field of fractions.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether A is an integral domain, we need to check if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n\n1. A is a commutative ring with unity.\n2. A has no zero divisors.\n\nFirst, let's check if A is commutative. Since xy - qyx = 1, we can see that xy â‰  yx, which means A is noncommutative. Therefore, A is not an integral domain.\n\nSince A is not an integral domain, we don't need to find its field of fractions."
