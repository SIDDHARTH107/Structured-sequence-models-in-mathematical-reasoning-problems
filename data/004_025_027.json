    "message_1": "A car is traveling at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour. Find the acceleration of the car if it takes 5 seconds for the car to come to a complete stop. (Hint: Use calculus to find the rate of change of velocity over time.)",
    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car, we need to find the rate of change of velocity over time. Since the car comes to a complete stop, the final velocity (v_f) is 0 miles per hour. The initial velocity (v_i) is 50 miles per hour. We are given that it takes 5 seconds for the car to come to a complete stop.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial velocity from miles per hour to feet per second for consistency in units. There are 5280 feet in a mile and 3600 seconds in an hour. So, we can convert 50 miles per hour to feet per second as follows:\n\n50 miles/hour * (5280 feet/mile) / (3600 seconds/hour) = 73.33 feet/second\n\nNow, we can use the formula for acceleration:\n\na = (v_f - v_i) / t\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, v_f is the final velocity, v_i is the initial velocity, and t is the time taken.\n\na = (0 - 73.33) / 5\na = -73.33 / 5\na = -14.67 feet/second²\n\nThe acceleration of the car is -14.67 feet/second². The negative sign indicates that the car is decelerating."
