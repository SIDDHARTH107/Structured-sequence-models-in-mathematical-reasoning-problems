    "message_1": "What is the length of the key for the Triple-DES block cipher algorithm, and how many possible keys does it have?",
    "message_2": "The Triple-DES (3DES) block cipher algorithm uses three individual DES keys, each with a length of 56 bits. Therefore, the total key length for Triple-DES is 56 * 3 = 168 bits. However, due to the meet-in-the-middle attack, the effective security provided by 3DES is considered to be 112 bits.\n\nAs for the number of possible keys, since each DES key is 56 bits long, there are 2^56 possible keys for each individual DES key. For Triple-DES, which uses three DES keys, the total number of possible key combinations is (2^56)^3 = 2^(56*3) = 2^168.\n\nHowever, considering the effective security of 112 bits, the number of possible keys that provide effective security is 2^112."
