    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2 in the interval [0, 2], we'll first find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 6x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 6\n\nNow, we'll set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x - 6 = 0\n6x = 6\nx = 1\n\nSo, we have one critical point at x = 1. Now we'll check the endpoints of the interval [0, 2] and the critical point to determine the maximum and minimum values of the function.\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^2 - 6(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1) + 2 = -1\nf(2) = 3(2)^2 - 6(2) + 2 = 2\n\nComparing the function values at the critical point and the endpoints, we find that the minimum value of the function is -1 at x = 1, and the maximum value of the function is 2 at both x = 0 and x = 2."
