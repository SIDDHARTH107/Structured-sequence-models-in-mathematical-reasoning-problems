    "message_2": "To find dy/dt, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if y is a function of u and u is a function of t, then the derivative of y with respect to t is the product of the derivative of y with respect to u and the derivative of u with respect to t. In this case, we have y as a function of x and x as a function of t.\n\nFirst, let's find dy/dx:\n\ny = cos(x^2)\ndy/dx = -sin(x^2) * (2x) = -2x * sin(x^2)\n\nNow, let's find dx/dt:\n\nx = sin(2t)\ndx/dt = cos(2t) * (2) = 2cos(2t)\n\nNow, we can find dy/dt using the chain rule:\n\ndy/dt = (dy/dx) * (dx/dt)\n\ndy/dt = (-2x * sin(x^2)) * (2cos(2t))\n\nSince x = sin(2t), we can substitute x back into the equation:\n\ndy/dt = (-2sin(2t) * sin((sin(2t))^2)) * (2cos(2t))\n\ndy/dt = -4sin(2t) * sin((sin(2t))^2) * cos(2t)"
