    "message_2": "To find the steady-state voltages across the capacitors C1 and C2 in a Chua circuit, we need to analyze the circuit and find the equilibrium points. The Chua circuit is a nonlinear circuit, and its behavior is described by a set of three differential equations:\n\n1. dV1/dt = (1/C1) * (V2 - V1 - f(V1))\n2. dV2/dt = (1/C2) * (V1 - V2 + V3)\n3. dV3/dt = -(1/L) * (V2 - R2 * I)\n\nwhere V1, V2, and V3 are the voltages across C1, C2, and L, respectively, and I is the current through the inductor L. The function f(V1) represents the nonlinear behavior of the Chua diode and is given by:\n\nf(V1) = R1 * (alpha * V1 - 1/3 * V1^3)\n\nTo find the steady-state voltages, we need to find the equilibrium points where the time derivatives are zero:\n\ndV1/dt = 0\ndV2/dt = 0\ndV3/dt = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\n1. V2 - V1 - f(V1) = 0\n2. V1 - V2 + V3 = 0\n3. V2 - R2 * I = 0\n\nSubstituting f(V1) in equation 1:\n\nV2 - V1 - R1 * (alpha * V1 - 1/3 * V1^3) = 0\n\nNow, we have a set of three nonlinear equations with three unknowns (V1, V2, and V3). Solving these equations analytically is difficult, so we can use numerical methods to find the equilibrium points.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific form of the Chua diode's nonlinear function, it is impossible to provide an exact numerical solution for the steady-state voltages across the capacitors C1 and C2. The Chua circuit is known for its chaotic behavior, and the equilibrium points can vary depending on the parameters and the specific form of the nonlinear function."
