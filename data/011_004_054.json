    "message_1": "A committee of 6 people is being formed from a group of 10 individuals. If 3 of the 10 individuals are from the same family, how many ways are there to form the committee such that no two family members serve together?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, we'll find the total number of ways to form a committee of 6 people from the group of 10 individuals, without any restrictions. Then, we'll subtract the number of ways that at least two family members serve together. Finally, we'll add back the number of ways that all three family members serve together, since we subtracted those cases twice.\n\n1. Total number of ways to form a committee of 6 people from 10 individuals (without restrictions):\nThis can be calculated using combinations: C(10,6) = 10! / (6! * 4!) = 210 ways.\n\n2. Number of ways that at least two family members serve together:\nWe can treat the pair of family members as a single entity, so we have 9 entities (7 individuals + 1 pair) to choose from. We need to choose 5 entities to form the committee: C(9,5) = 9! / (5! * 4!) = 126 ways. However, there are 3 possible pairs of family members, so we need to multiply this by 3: 126 * 3 = 378 ways.\n\n3. Number of ways that all three family members serve together:\nNow, we treat the three family members as a single entity. We have 8 entities (7 individuals + 1 triplet) to choose from, and we need to choose 4 entities to form the committee: C(8,4) = 8! / (4! * 4!) = 70 ways.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can now calculate the number of ways to form the committee such that no two family members serve together:\n\nTotal ways - ways with at least two family members + ways with all three family members = 210 - 378 + 70 = 2 ways.\n\nSo, there are 2 ways to form the committee such that no two family members serve together."
