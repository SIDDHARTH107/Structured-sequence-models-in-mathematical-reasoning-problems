    "message_1": "Suppose you have a knot that has 8 crossings. How many different knot diagrams are there for this knot?",
    "message_2": "The number of different knot diagrams for a knot with a specific number of crossings is not a straightforward calculation, as it depends on various factors such as the type of knot, its symmetry, and other topological properties. However, we can provide some information on the possible knots with 8 crossings.\n\nIn knot theory, knots are classified by their minimal crossing number, which is the smallest number of crossings in any diagram representing the knot. For a knot with 8 crossings, there are 21 prime knots (knots that cannot be formed by joining two or more simpler knots). These prime knots are denoted as 8_1, 8_2, ..., 8_21.\n\nIt's important to note that each prime knot can have multiple knot diagrams, which are related by Reidemeister moves (local transformations that do not change the knot's topology). The number of distinct knot diagrams for each prime knot with 8 crossings can vary, and calculating the exact number for each knot is a complex task.\n\nIn summary, there are 21 prime knots with 8 crossings, but the total number of distinct knot diagrams for all these knots is not easily determined."
