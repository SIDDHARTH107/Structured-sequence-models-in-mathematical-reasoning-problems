    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem for the math student to solve:\n\nHaving 10 data points in a dataset, the mean is 20 and the standard deviation is 3. If one data point has a value of 35, is it an outlier?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the data point with a value of 35 is an outlier, we can use the z-score method. The z-score is calculated as follows:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the data point, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 35, μ = 20, and σ = 3.\n\nz = (35 - 20) / 3\nz = 15 / 3\nz = 5\n\nA z-score greater than 2 or less than -2 is generally considered an outlier. Since the z-score for the data point with a value of 35 is 5, it is considered an outlier."
