In general, the total length of a Hilbert curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order n, the number of segments is given by:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^n\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 4, we have:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^4 = 256\n\nSince the length of each line segment is 1 unit, the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 4 is:\n\nLength = 256 * 1 = 256 units"
