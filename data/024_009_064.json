In spherical coordinates, the metric tensor for a 3D sphere is given by:\n\ng_ij = diag(r^2, r^2 * sin^2(θ))\n\nwhere i and j are indices that run from 1 to 3, and θ is the polar angle.\n\nNext, we need to compute the Christoffel symbols, which are given by:\n\nΓ^k_ij = (1/2) * g^(kl) * (∂g_lj/∂x^i + ∂g_li/∂x^j - ∂g_ij/∂x^l)\n\nwhere g^(kl) is the inverse of the metric tensor g_ij.\n\nAfter calculating the Christoffel symbols, we can compute the Riemann curvature tensor:\n\nR^l_ijk = ∂Γ^l_ij/∂x^k - ∂Γ^l_ik/∂x^j + Γ^l_mk * Γ^m_ij - Γ^l_mj * Γ^m_ik\n\nNow, we can find the Ricci tensor by contracting the Riemann tensor:\n\nR_ij = R^k_ikj\n\nFinally, we can compute the scalar curvature by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric tensor:\n\nR = g^(ij) * R_ij\n\nFor a 3D sphere with radius r, after performing these calculations, we find that the scalar curvature is:\n\nR = 6 / r^2"
