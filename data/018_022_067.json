    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. \n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nSo, A Δ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nB ∩ A = {3, 4}\n\nSo, B Δ A = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,5), (2,6), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,5), (6,6)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (B Δ A) and (A Δ B).\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,5), (2,6), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,5), (6,6)}\n\nAs we can see, the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A) is equal to the Cartesian product of (B Δ A) and (A Δ B). Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to Cartesian product."
