    "message_2": "We are given a triangle with sides a = 7, b = 9, and c = 10. We want to find the angle C opposite the side with length 10. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the given side lengths:\n\ncos(C) = (7^2 + 9^2 - 10^2) / (2 * 7 * 9)\ncos(C) = (49 + 81 - 100) / (126)\ncos(C) = (130 - 100) / 126\ncos(C) = 30 / 126\ncos(C) = 1 / 4.2\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(1 / 4.2)\n\nC ≈ 75.52°\n\nSo, the angle opposite the side with length 10 is approximately 75.52°."
