    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm and the length of its two parallel sides are 15 cm and 20 cm respectively. Calculate the area of this trapezoid in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 15 cm and 20 cm, and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (15 + 20) * 10\nArea = (1/2) * (35) * 10\nArea = 17.5 * 10\nArea = 175 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of this trapezoid is 175 square centimeters."
