    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ of the complex projective variety associated with the given algebraic curve, we first need to determine its genus. The given curve is a plane cubic curve, and we can use the following formula to compute its genus:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, the degree is 3, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ using the Hodge diamond for a curve of genus $g$. The Hodge diamond for a curve of genus $g$ is given by:\n\n```\n  h^{0,0}\nh^{1,0} h^{0,1}\n  h^{1,1}\n```\n\nFor a curve of genus $g$, we have $h^{0,0} = 1$, $h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = g$, and $h^{1,1} = 0$. Thus, for our curve with genus 1, the Hodge diamond is:\n\n```\n    1\n  1   1\n    0\n```\n\nSo, the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ for the complex projective variety associated with the given algebraic curve are:\n\n- $h^{0,0} = 1$\n- $h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 1$\n- $h^{1,1} = 0$\n\nAll other Hodge numbers are zero since they are not in the Hodge diamond for a curve."
