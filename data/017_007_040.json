    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 6. By the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 3 (a Sylow 3-subgroup) and a subgroup of order 2 (a Sylow 2-subgroup). Since the order of an element divides the order of the group, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n1. There is always exactly one element of order 1, which is the identity element.\n\n2. Let's consider elements of order 2. If x is an element of order 2, then x^2 = e (the identity element). The Sylow 2-subgroup has order 2, so it must have one non-identity element of order 2. Let's call this element a. So, a^2 = e.\n\n3. Now let's consider elements of order 3. If y is an element of order 3, then y^3 = e. The Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3, so it must have two non-identity elements of order 3. Let's call these elements b and c. So, b^3 = c^3 = e.\n\n4. Finally, let's consider elements of order 6. If z is an element of order 6, then z^6 = e. However, if G has an element of order 6, then G would be cyclic, and thus isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 6 (Z6). But we know that G has a subgroup of order 2 (the Sylow 2-subgroup), which Z6 does not have. Therefore, G cannot have any elements of order 6.\n\nSo, G has 1 element of order 1, 1 element of order 2, and 2 elements of order 3. In total, G has 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 non-identity elements, and 1 identity element, for a total of 5 elements. Since G has order 6, there must be one more element. This element cannot be of order 1, 3, or 6, so it must be of order 2. Let's call this element d. So, d^2 = e.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 6 has 2 elements of order 2."
