    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3 over the domain x ∈ [0, 4], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the domain.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 2x^2 + 3) = 3x^2 - 4x\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 4x = 0\nx(3x - 4) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points: x = 0 and x = 4/3.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the domain:\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 2(0)^2 + 3 = 3\nf(4/3) = (4/3)^3 - 2(4/3)^2 + 3 ≈ -0.037\nf(4) = 4^3 - 2(4)^2 + 3 = 27\n\nThe minimum value of the function over the domain x ∈ [0, 4] is approximately -0.037, which occurs at x = 4/3."
