    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of the graph G, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relations between the vertices. In other words, we need to find all the ways to relabel the vertices such that the graph remains unchanged.\n\nFirst, let's observe the graph. We can see that vertices 1, 2, 6, and 7 are of degree 3, while vertices 3, 4, and 5 are of degree 4. This observation helps us to narrow down the possible permutations, as vertices with different degrees cannot be mapped to each other.\n\nNow, let's find the possible permutations:\n\n1. The identity permutation, which maps each vertex to itself, is always an automorphism. So, (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7) is an automorphism.\n\n2. We can swap vertices 1 and 2, and at the same time swap vertices 6 and 7. This gives us the permutation (12)(67). The graph remains unchanged under this permutation.\n\n3. Similarly, we can swap vertices 1 and 6, and at the same time swap vertices 2 and 7. This gives us the permutation (16)(27). The graph remains unchanged under this permutation.\n\n4. We can also swap vertices 1 and 7, and at the same time swap vertices 2 and 6. This gives us the permutation (17)(26). The graph remains unchanged under this permutation.\n\nThese are all the possible permutations that leave the graph invariant. Therefore, the automorphism group of the graph G is:\n\n{ (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7), (12)(67), (16)(27), (17)(26) }"
