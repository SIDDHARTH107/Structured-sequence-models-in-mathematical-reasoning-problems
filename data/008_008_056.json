    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products A and B. Each unit of A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 kg of raw material, while each unit of B requires 3 hours of labor and 2 kg of raw material. The company has 240 hours of labor and 180 kg of raw material available. If the profit per unit of A is $5 and of B is $4, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?\n\nHint: Let x be the number of units of A and y be the number of units of B produced. Then the problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nMaximize: P = 5x + 4y\nSubject to:\n2x + 3y ≤ 240 (hours of labor)\n3x + 2y ≤ 180 (kg of raw material)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity)",
    "message_2": "To solve this linear programming problem, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then determine the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. Graph the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 240 (hours of labor)\n3x + 2y ≤ 180 (kg of raw material)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity)\n\n2. Determine the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. These points are:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 80) - Intersection of y-axis and 2x + 3y = 240\nC: (60, 0) - Intersection of x-axis and 3x + 2y = 180\nD: (30, 40) - Intersection of 2x + 3y = 240 and 3x + 2y = 180\n\n3. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP = 5x + 4y\n\nA: P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = 0\nB: P(0, 80) = 5(0) + 4(80) = 320\nC: P(60, 0) = 5(60) + 4(0) = 300\nD: P(30, 40) = 5(30) + 4(40) = 310\n\n4. Determine the maximum profit:\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point B, with a profit of $320. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize its profit."
