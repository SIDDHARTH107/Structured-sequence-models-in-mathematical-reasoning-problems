    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted by n_5, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, denoted by n_7, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility for n_7 is 1.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be the unique Sylow 7-subgroup of G. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G. The orders of P and Q are 5 and 7, respectively, which are prime numbers. By Lagrange's theorem, the orders of the elements in P and Q are either 1 or the order of the subgroup. Thus, P and Q are cyclic groups.\n\nNow, we will show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are normal in G, we can form the product set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. We will show that PQ is a subgroup of G. Let x, y ∈ PQ. Then x = p_1q_1 and y = p_2q_2 for some p_1, p_2 ∈ P and q_1, q_2 ∈ Q. Then xy = p_1q_1p_2q_2. Since Q is normal in G, q_1p_2 = p_3q_3 for some p_3 ∈ P and q_3 ∈ Q. Thus, xy = p_1p_3q_3q_2 ∈ PQ. Therefore, PQ is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we will show that the order of PQ is 35. By the double coset formula, |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q are cyclic groups of prime orders 5 and 7, respectively, their intersection can only be the identity element. Thus, |P ∩ Q| = 1, and |PQ| = 5 * 7 / 1 = 35. Since |PQ| = |G|, PQ = G.\n\nFinally, we will show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are cyclic groups, their elements commute with each other. Thus, G = PQ is the internal direct product of P and Q. If there exists an element in G of order 35, then G is cyclic. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively."
