    "message_2": "The proof complexity of a formula in first-order logic depends on the specific proof system being used, as well as the structure of the formula and the underlying theory. In general, it is difficult to provide an exact measure of proof complexity for a given formula without more context.\n\nHowever, we can discuss the proof complexity of the given formula, $\\forall x \\exists y P(x, y)$, in a more general sense. This formula asserts that for every value of $x$, there exists a value of $y$ such that the predicate $P(x, y)$ holds. To prove the validity of this formula, one would typically need to provide a proof that demonstrates this assertion holds for all possible values of $x$ and suitable values of $y$.\n\nIn general, the proof complexity of this formula would depend on:\n\n1. The specific proof system being used (e.g., sequent calculus, natural deduction, resolution, etc.).\n2. The underlying theory or axioms that define the predicate $P(x, y)$.\n3. The structure of the formula and the quantifiers involved.\n\nWithout more information about the proof system and the underlying theory, it is not possible to provide a specific measure of proof complexity for the given formula. However, it is worth noting that first-order logic is undecidable in general, which means that there may not always be a finite proof for a given formula, or it may be very difficult to find one."
