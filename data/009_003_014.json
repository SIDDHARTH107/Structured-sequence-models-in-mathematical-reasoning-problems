    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the math student to solve:\n\nA metal bar with a length of 10 cm and cross-sectional area of 2 cm2 is heated such that its initial temperature is 20°C. It's then placed in a room with a constant temperature of 5°C. If the bar's temperature decreases at a rate proportional to the temperature difference between the bar and the room, with a constant of proportionality of 0.02 min-1, what will be the temperature of the bar after 5 minutes?",
    "message_2": "We can model the cooling of the metal bar using Newton's Law of Cooling, which states that the rate of change of the temperature of an object is proportional to the difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\ndT/dt = -k(T - Tₐ)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the object, Tₐ is the ambient temperature, k is the constant of proportionality, and dT/dt is the rate of change of the temperature.\n\nIn this problem, we have Tₐ = 5°C, k = 0.02 min⁻¹, and the initial temperature T(0) = 20°C. We want to find the temperature of the bar after 5 minutes, or T(5).\n\nFirst, we need to solve the differential equation:\n\ndT/dt = -0.02(T - 5)\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We'll move all the terms involving T to the left side and all the terms involving time to the right side:\n\ndT/(T - 5) = -0.02 dt\n\nNow, we'll integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/(T - 5)) dT = ∫(-0.02) dt\n\nThe left side is the integral of a simple rational function, which results in the natural logarithm:\n\nln|T - 5| = -0.02t + C\n\nTo find the constant of integration C, we'll use the initial condition T(0) = 20:\n\nln|20 - 5| = -0.02(0) + C\nln|15| = C\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation with the constant of integration:\n\nln|T - 5| = -0.02t + ln|15|\n\nTo solve for T, we'll first eliminate the natural logarithm by taking the exponent of both sides:\n\nT - 5 = 15e^(-0.02t)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature of the bar after 5 minutes by plugging in t = 5:\n\nT(5) - 5 = 15e^(-0.02 * 5)\nT(5) - 5 = 15e^(-0.1)\nT(5) = 5 + 15e^(-0.1)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value:\n\nT(5) ≈ 5 + 15e^(-0.1) ≈ 5 + 15 * 0.9048 ≈ 5 + 13.572 ≈ 18.572\n\nSo, the temperature of the bar after 5 minutes will be approximately 18.572°C."
