Calculate the maximum number of edges for a graph with 10 vertices and girth g.\n\n2. Compare this number with the given number of edges (15) to determine the girth.\n\nLet's start with girth g = 3 (a triangle). For a graph with girth 3 and 10 vertices, the maximum number of edges is given by the Turán's theorem:\n\nn * (n - 1) / 2 - (n - r) * (n - r - 1) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices, and r is the number of parts in the Turán graph (for girth 3, r = 3).\n\nFor n = 10 and r = 3, we have:\n\n10 * (10 - 1) / 2 - (10 - 3) * (10 - 3 - 1) / 2 = 45 - 28 = 17\n\nSince 15 edges are less than the maximum number of edges (17) for a graph with girth 3, it is possible to have a graph with 10 vertices, 15 edges, and girth 3.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph is 3."
