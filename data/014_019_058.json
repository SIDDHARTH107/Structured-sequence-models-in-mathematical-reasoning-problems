    "message_2": "To solve this problem, follow the steps of the transposition cipher algorithm:\n\n1. Replace the second letter of the word with the last letter of the word:\n   Original word: MATHEMATICS\n   After replacement: MCTHEMATISA\n\n2. Reverse the order of the letters in the word:\n   After replacement: MCTHEMATISA\n   Reversed: ASITAMEHTCM\n\nThe resulting ciphertext from the word \"MATHEMATICS\" is \"ASITAMEHTCM\"."
