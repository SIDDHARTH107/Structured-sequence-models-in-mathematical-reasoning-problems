    "message_2": "To find the size of the largest independent set in G, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of the largest independent set (α(G)) and the size of the largest vertex cover (β(G)) is equal to the total number of vertices in the graph (n).\n\nn = α(G) + β(G)\n\nWe know that n = 9. To find β(G), we can use the inequality relating the number of edges (m) and the size of the largest vertex cover:\n\nm ≤ (β(G) * (n - β(G))) / 2\n\nWe know that m = 12. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n12 ≤ (β(G) * (9 - β(G))) / 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n24 ≤ β(G) * (9 - β(G))\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest integer value of β(G) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by trial and error:\n\nFor β(G) = 1:\n24 ≤ 1 * (9 - 1) = 8 (False)\n\nFor β(G) = 2:\n24 ≤ 2 * (9 - 2) = 14 (False)\n\nFor β(G) = 3:\n24 ≤ 3 * (9 - 3) = 18 (False)\n\nFor β(G) = 4:\n24 ≤ 4 * (9 - 4) = 20 (False)\n\nFor β(G) = 5:\n24 ≤ 5 * (9 - 5) = 20 (False)\n\nFor β(G) = 6:\n24 ≤ 6 * (9 - 6) = 18 (True)\n\nSo, the smallest integer value of β(G) that satisfies the inequality is 6. Now, we can find the size of the largest independent set (α(G)):\n\n9 = α(G) + 6\n\nα(G) = 9 - 6 = 3\n\nTherefore, the size of the largest independent set in G is 3."
