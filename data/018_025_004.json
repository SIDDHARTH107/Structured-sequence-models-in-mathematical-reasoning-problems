    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. In other words, it's the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nSince A and B have no common elements (A contains only odd numbers and B contains only even numbers), their intersection is an empty set.\n\nA ∩ B = {}\n\nNow, let's find the union of sets A and B. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow let's show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the intersection of A and B.\n\nCommutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter. In other words, if the symmetric difference is commutative with respect to the intersection, then the following should be true:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = (A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B)\n\nWe already know that A ∩ B = {} and A ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Let's find the intersections:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ∩ {} = {}\n\n(A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B) = {} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} = {}\n\nSince both intersections are equal, the symmetric difference of A and B is actually commutative with respect to the intersection of A and B."
