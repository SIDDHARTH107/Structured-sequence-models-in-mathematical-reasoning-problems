    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It was first introduced by Giuseppe Peano in 1890. The curve is constructed iteratively, with each iteration increasing the complexity of the curve.\n\nFor each iteration n, the length of the Peano curve is given by the formula:\n\nLength = (3^n) * (side length of the square)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations and the side length of the square is the length of one side of the square that the Peano curve fills.\n\nIt's important to note that as n approaches infinity, the length of the Peano curve approaches infinity as well, even though it is contained within a finite area. This is a characteristic of space-filling curves in general."
