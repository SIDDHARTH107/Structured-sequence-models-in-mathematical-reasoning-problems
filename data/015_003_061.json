    "message_2": "The period doubling bifurcation parameter value refers to the value of the control parameter at which the period of the logistic map doubles. For the logistic map, the equation is given by:\n\nxₙ₊₁ = r * xₙ * (1 - xₙ)\n\nwhere xₙ is the population at time n, r is the control parameter, and xₙ₊₁ is the population at time n+1.\n\nThe first period doubling bifurcation occurs at r ≈ 3, and the second period doubling bifurcation occurs at r ≈ 3.44949. Since the control parameter given is 3.5, it lies between the second and third period doubling bifurcation points. Therefore, the logistic map with a control parameter of 3.5 will have a period of 4.\n\nHowever, to find the specific period doubling bifurcation parameter value for the logistic map with a control parameter of 3.5, we would need to know which bifurcation point you are referring to. If you are looking for the value of r at which the period doubles from 2 to 4, that would be the second bifurcation point, which is approximately r ≈ 3.44949."
