    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane that passes through point P(2, 3, 5) and contains the intersection line of the given planes, we first need to find a parametric equation for the intersection line.\n\nLet's start by solving the given planes' system of equations:\n\n2x + y - z = 1\n3x - y + 2z = 4\n\nWe can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n\n(2x + y - z) + (3x - y + 2z) = 1 + 4\n5x + 0y + z = 5\n\nNow we have a simpler equation:\n\n5x + z = 5\n\nLet's express z in terms of x:\n\nz = 5 - 5x\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate using either of the original equations. Let's use the first one:\n\ny = z + 2x - 1\ny = (5 - 5x) + 2x - 1\ny = -3x + 4\n\nNow we have parametric equations for the intersection line:\n\nx = x\ny = -3x + 4\nz = 5 - 5x\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the plane that passes through P(2, 3, 5) and contains this intersection line. We can use the point-normal form of the plane equation:\n\nA(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0\n\nHere, (x0, y0, z0) is a point on the plane, and (A, B, C) is the normal vector to the plane. We know that P(2, 3, 5) lies on the plane, so we can use it as (x0, y0, z0).\n\nNow we need to find the normal vector to the plane. Since the plane contains the intersection line of the given planes, its normal vector is the cross product of the normal vectors of the given planes.\n\nThe normal vectors of the given planes are:\n\nN1 = (2, 1, -1)\nN2 = (3, -1, 2)\n\nNow, let's find the cross product N3 = N1 x N2:\n\nN3 = (1*(-1) - (-1)*2, (-1)*2 - 2*3, 2*(-1) - 1*3)\nN3 = (-1 + 2, -2 - 6, -2 - 3)\nN3 = (1, -8, -5)\n\nNow we have the normal vector N3 = (1, -8, -5). We can plug this into the point-normal form of the plane equation along with the point P(2, 3, 5):\n\n1(x - 2) - 8(y - 3) - 5(z - 5) = 0\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\nx - 2 - 8y + 24 - 5z + 25 = 0\nx - 8y - 5z + 47 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the plane that passes through the point P(2, 3, 5) and contains the intersection line of the given planes is:\n\nx - 8y - 5z + 47 = 0"
