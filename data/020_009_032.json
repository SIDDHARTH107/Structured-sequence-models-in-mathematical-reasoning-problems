    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has a daily demand for their product as follows: 100 units with a probability of 0.2, 150 units with a probability of 0.5, and 200 units with a probability of 0.3. The company can produce the product at two different production rates: 80 units per hour with a cost of $50 per hour and 120 units per hour with a cost of $80 per hour. What is the optimal production strategy for the company to minimize their costs given this stochastic demand?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production strategy, we need to calculate the expected cost for each production rate and compare them. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected daily demand:\n\nExpected demand = (100 units * 0.2) + (150 units * 0.5) + (200 units * 0.3) = 20 + 75 + 60 = 155 units\n\nNow, let's calculate the production time and cost for each production rate:\n\n1. 80 units per hour:\n- To meet the expected demand of 155 units, the company needs to produce for 155/80 = 1.9375 hours.\n- The cost for this production rate is 1.9375 hours * $50 per hour = $96.88 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\n2. 120 units per hour:\n- To meet the expected demand of 155 units, the company needs to produce for 155/120 = 1.2917 hours.\n- The cost for this production rate is 1.2917 hours * $80 per hour = $103.33 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nComparing the costs, the optimal production strategy for the company to minimize their costs given the stochastic demand is to produce at a rate of 80 units per hour, with an expected cost of $96.88 per day."
