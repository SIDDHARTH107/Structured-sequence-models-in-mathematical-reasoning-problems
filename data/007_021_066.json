    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an algorithm for finding a non-trivial factor of a composite number. In this case, we want to find the smallest prime factor of the number 2431.\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod n), where n is the number we want to factor (in this case, 2431).\n\n2. Choose random initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the function f(x) for both x and y, but apply the function twice for y in each iteration (i.e., y = f(f(y))). This is also known as Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm.\n\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y, and the number n (GCD(|x - y|, n)). If the GCD is not 1 and not equal to n, we have found a non-trivial factor.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until a non-trivial factor is found.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm:\n\n1. f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod 2431)\n2. x = 2, y = 2\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = 2^2 + 1 = 5 (mod 2431)\ny = f(f(y)) = f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26 (mod 2431)\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 2431) = GCD(21, 2431) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = 5^2 + 1 = 26 (mod 2431)\ny = f(f(y)) = f(26) = 26^2 + 1 = 677 (mod 2431)\nGCD(|26 - 677|, 2431) = GCD(651, 2431) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = f(x) = 26^2 + 1 = 677 (mod 2431)\ny = f(f(y)) = f(677) = 677^2 + 1 = 458330 (mod 2431) = 1129\nGCD(|677 - 1129|, 2431) = GCD(452, 2431) = 13\n\nWe have found a non-trivial factor, 13. Since 13 is a prime number, it is also the smallest prime factor of 2431."
