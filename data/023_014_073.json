    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x) = A * e^(-bx²), we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) * ∫[ψ(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nLet's plug in the given wave function:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) * ∫[A * e^(-bx²) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: u = √(2b) * x. Then, du = √(2b) * dx, and dx = du / √(2b).\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) * ∫[A * e^(-u²/2) * e^(-ik(u/√(2b)))] (du / √(2b))\n\nNow, we can factor out the constants:\n\nF(k) = (A/√(4πb)) * ∫[e^(-u²/2) * e^(-ik(u/√(2b)))] du\n\nThis integral is a Gaussian integral with a complex exponential. To solve it, we can use the following property of Gaussian integrals:\n\n∫[e^(-αx²) * e^(ikx)] dx = √(π/α) * e^(-k²/(4α)), where α > 0.\n\nIn our case, α = 1/2 and k' = k/√(2b). So, we have:\n\nF(k) = (A/√(4πb)) * √(2π) * e^(-(k²/2b)/4)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nF(k) = (A/√(2πb)) * e^(-k²/(8b))\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x) = A * e^(-bx²) is F(k) = (A/√(2πb)) * e^(-k²/(8b))."
