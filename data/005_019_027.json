    "message_1": "A bus route has three stops: A, B, C. The probability of starting the route at stop A is 0.4, at stop B is 0.3, and at stop C is 0.3. The probability of remaining at the same stop is 0.6, and the probability of moving to the next stop is 0.4. If the bus starts at stop A, what is the probability it will reach stop C without returning to stop A or B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the bus reaching stop C without returning to stop A or B, we need to consider the possible paths the bus can take. Since the bus starts at stop A, the only path that satisfies the condition is A -> B -> C.\n\nThe probability of the bus moving from stop A to stop B is 0.4 (given). Once the bus is at stop B, the probability of it remaining at stop B is 0.6, and the probability of moving to stop C is 0.4.\n\nSo, the probability of the bus reaching stop C without returning to stop A or B is the product of the probabilities of moving from stop A to stop B and from stop B to stop C:\n\nP(A -> B -> C) = P(A -> B) * P(B -> C) = 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16\n\nTherefore, the probability of the bus reaching stop C without returning to stop A or B is 0.16 or 16%."
