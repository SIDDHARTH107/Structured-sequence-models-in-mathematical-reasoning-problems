    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. In this case, we need to find the largest set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nBy analyzing the adjacency matrix, we can find the following cliques:\n\n1. {1, 4, 5} (vertices 2, 5, and 6)\n2. {3, 4, 7} (vertices 4, 5, and 7)\n3. {2, 3, 6} (vertices 3, 4, and 6)\n\nEach of these cliques has 3 vertices, and there is no clique with more than 3 vertices in the graph. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
