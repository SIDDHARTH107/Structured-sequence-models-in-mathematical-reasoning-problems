    "message_1": "A magician has 18 cards, out of which 6 are red and 12 are black. If the magician randomly selects 4 cards from the deck, what is the probability that exactly 2 of the cards selected will be red?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting exactly 2 red cards, we can use the formula for combinations and probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. This is the number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 18 cards, which can be calculated using combinations:\n\nC(18, 4) = 18! / (4! * (18 - 4)!)\nC(18, 4) = 18! / (4! * 14!)\nC(18, 4) = 3060\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes. This is the number of ways to choose exactly 2 red cards from the 6 red cards and 2 black cards from the 12 black cards:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!)\nC(6, 2) = 15\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * (12 - 2)!)\nC(12, 2) = 66\n\nTo find the number of ways to choose 2 red cards and 2 black cards, we multiply the number of ways to choose 2 red cards by the number of ways to choose 2 black cards:\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes = C(6, 2) * C(12, 2) = 15 * 66 = 990\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 990 / 3060\nProbability = 33 / 102\n\nSo, the probability of selecting exactly 2 red cards is 33/102 or approximately 0.3235 (rounded to four decimal places)."
