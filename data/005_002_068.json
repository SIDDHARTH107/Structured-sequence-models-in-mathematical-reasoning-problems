A sample of 50 males was taken, and the mean height of the sample was found to be 172 cm. \n\nWhat is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of adult males in the city?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of adult males in the city, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Population Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 172 cm, the population standard deviation is 6 cm, and the sample size is 50. Let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 6 / √50 ≈ 0.849\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 172 ± (1.96 * 0.849)\n\nConfidence Interval = 172 ± 1.664\n\nLower Bound = 172 - 1.664 ≈ 170.336\nUpper Bound = 172 + 1.664 ≈ 173.664\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of adult males in the city is approximately (170.336 cm, 173.664 cm)."
