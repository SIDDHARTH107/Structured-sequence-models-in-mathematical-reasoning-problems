    "message_1": "What is the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism that has a length of `10` meters, a width of `5` meters, and a height of `8` meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nDiagonal length = √(10² + 5² + 8²)\nDiagonal length = √(100 + 25 + 64)\nDiagonal length = √189\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √189 meters."
