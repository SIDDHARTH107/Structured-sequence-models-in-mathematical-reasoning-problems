What is the smallest number of people that must be assigned to the same team (i.e., either Red or Blue) to guarantee that there will be a group of three people who are all on the same team?",
    "message_2": "To guarantee that there will be a group of three people who are all on the same team, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. In this case, the \"pigeons\" are the six people, and the \"holes\" are the two teams (Red and Blue).\n\nIf we evenly distribute the people among the two teams, we would have 3 people on each team. However, if we add just one more person to either team, we will have at least 4 people on one team. In this case, it is guaranteed that there will be a group of three people who are all on the same team.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of people that must be assigned to the same team to guarantee a group of three people on the same team is 4."
