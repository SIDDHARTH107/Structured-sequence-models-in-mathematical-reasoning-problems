    "message_2": "The given equation x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 represents a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the xy-plane. To find the isometries that leave the manifold invariant, we need to consider transformations that preserve distances and the shape of the circle.\n\nThere are three types of isometries in the Euclidean plane: translations, rotations, and reflections.\n\n1. Translations: Since the circle is centered at the origin, any translation would move the circle away from the origin, and thus, it would not be an invariant transformation.\n\n2. Rotations: Rotations about the origin will leave the circle invariant. Any angle of rotation θ (0 ≤ θ < 2π) will result in an isometry that preserves the circle.\n\n3. Reflections: Reflections across any line passing through the origin will also leave the circle invariant. For example, reflections across the x-axis, y-axis, or any line y = kx where k is a constant, will preserve the circle.\n\nNow, let's consider non-isometric symmetries. Non-isometric symmetries are transformations that change the distances between points but still preserve the shape of the manifold. In the case of the circle, there are no non-isometric symmetries, as any transformation that changes the distances between points would distort the circle and not preserve its shape.\n\nIn conclusion, the isometries that leave the given 2-dimensional manifold invariant are rotations about the origin and reflections across any line passing through the origin. There are no non-isometric symmetries for this manifold."
