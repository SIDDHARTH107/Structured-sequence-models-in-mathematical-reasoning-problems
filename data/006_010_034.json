    "message_2": "To find the probability of the given scenario, we first need to determine the number of males and females in the population, and then find the number of affected individuals for each gender.\n\nOut of the 500 individuals:\n- 60% are males: 0.6 * 500 = 300 males\n- 40% are females: 0.4 * 500 = 200 females\n\nNow, we need to find the number of affected individuals for each gender:\n- 70% of males are affected: 0.7 * 300 = 210 affected males\n- 50% of females are affected: 0.5 * 200 = 100 affected females\n\nIn total, there are 210 + 100 = 310 affected individuals in the population.\n\nSince we are asked for the probability of this scenario, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nProbability = (Number of affected individuals) / (Total population)\nProbability = 310 / 500\nProbability = 0.62 or 62%\n\nSo, the probability that 70% of males and 50% of females are affected by the disease in this population is 62%."
