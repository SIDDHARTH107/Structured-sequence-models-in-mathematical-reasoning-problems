    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 7 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the surface area of the cone, rounded to the nearest square centimeter?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral surface area (a curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is:\n\nSurface Area = πr² + πrL\n\nwhere r is the radius, L is the slant height, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (L) using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle formed by the radius, height, and slant height:\n\nL² = r² + h²\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 7 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm:\n\nL² = (7 cm)² + (10 cm)²\nL² = 49 cm² + 100 cm²\nL² = 149 cm²\nL = √149 cm\nL ≈ 12.21 cm\n\nNow, we can find the surface area:\n\nSurface Area ≈ π(7 cm)² + π(7 cm)(12.21 cm)\nSurface Area ≈ 3.14159 × (49 cm²) + 3.14159 × (7 cm × 12.21 cm)\nSurface Area ≈ 153.94 cm² + 268.27 cm²\nSurface Area ≈ 422.21 cm²\n\nRounded to the nearest square centimeter, the surface area of the cone is approximately 422 cm²."
