    "message_1": "A boat is moving on a lake in a direction 60° east of north at a speed of 20 km/h. What is the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector of the boat?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector of the boat, we can break down the velocity into its north and east components. \n\nLet Vn be the northward component of the velocity and Ve be the eastward component of the velocity. We can use trigonometry to find these components:\n\nVn = V * cos(θ)\nVe = V * sin(θ)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the velocity (20 km/h) and θ is the angle (60° east of north).\n\nFirst, convert the angle to radians:\nθ = 60° * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, find the northward and eastward components:\nVn = 20 * cos(π/3) = 20 * (1/2) = 10 km/h\nVe = 20 * sin(π/3) = 20 * (√3/2) = 10√3 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\nV = √(Vn² + Ve²) = √(10² + (10√3)²) = √(100 + 300) = √400 = 20 km/h\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector can be found using the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(Ve/Vn) = arctan(10√3/10) = arctan(√3) = π/3 radians\n\nConverting back to degrees:\nθ = (π/3) * (180/π) = 60°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the velocity vector is 20 km/h, and its direction is 60° east of north."
