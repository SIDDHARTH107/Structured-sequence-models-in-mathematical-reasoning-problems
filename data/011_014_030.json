    "message_1": "A school has seven classrooms, and students from six different grades (1st to 6th) attend. How many possible ways are there to assign the grades to the classrooms if each classroom can accommodate only one grade and all grades must be assigned?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 7 classrooms and 6 grades, we can use the formula for permutations to find the number of ways to assign the grades to the classrooms. The formula for permutations is:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (classrooms), r is the number of items to be chosen (grades), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (classrooms) and r = 6 (grades).\n\nP(7, 6) = 7! / (7 - 6)!\n\nP(7, 6) = 7! / 1!\n\nP(7, 6) = 5040 / 1\n\nP(7, 6) = 5040\n\nSo there are 5040 possible ways to assign the 6 grades to the 7 classrooms."
