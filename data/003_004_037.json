    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) = cos(2x) for x between 0 and 360 degrees, we can use the trigonometric identity:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nsin(x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x)\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n2sin^2(x) + sin(x) - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in sin(x). Let's solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nsin(x) = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2, b = 1, and c = -1.\n\nsin(x) = [-1 ± sqrt(1^2 - 4(2)(-1))] / (2 * 2)\nsin(x) = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 4\nsin(x) = [-1 ± sqrt(9)] / 4\nsin(x) = [-1 ± 3] / 4\n\nWe have two possible solutions for sin(x):\n\nsin(x) = (3 - 1) / 4 = 1/2\nsin(x) = (-1 - 3) / 4 = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for these two solutions:\n\n1) sin(x) = 1/2\nx = arcsin(1/2)\nx = 30°, 150° (since sin is positive in the first and second quadrants)\n\n2) sin(x) = -1\nx = arcsin(-1)\nx = 270° (since sin is negative in the third quadrant)\n\nSo, the values of x between 0 and 360 degrees that satisfy the equation sin(x) = cos(2x) are:\n\nx = 30°, 150°, and 270°."
