    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for the student:\n\nSuppose we have the following partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k * ∂²u/∂x² \n\nwhere k is a constant, u is the function to be found, and x,t represent spatial and temporal coordinates. We are given that u(x,0) = 4sin(3x) and u(0,t) = u(π,t) = 0. \n\nUsing Fourier series, find the solution u(x,t) of the above partial differential equation.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first assume that the solution u(x,t) can be represented as a product of two functions, one dependent on x and the other on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k * ∂²u/∂x²\n=> X(x) * dT(t)/dt = k * d²X(x)/dx² * T(t)\n\nNext, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by u(x,t) = X(x)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t)) * dT(t)/dt = k * (1/X(x)) * d²X(x)/dx²\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1/T(t)) * dT(t)/dt = -λ\nk * (1/X(x)) * d²X(x)/dx² = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. dT(t)/dt = -λT(t)\n2. d²X(x)/dx² = -(λ/k)X(x)\n\nFor equation 2, we consider the boundary conditions u(0,t) = X(0)T(t) = 0 and u(π,t) = X(π)T(t) = 0. This implies that X(0) = X(π) = 0. The general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A * sin(√(λ/k) * x) + B * cos(√(λ/k) * x)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get B = 0 and √(λ/k) * π = n * π, where n is an integer. Thus, λ = n² * k. The solution for X(x) becomes:\n\nX(x) = A * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, we solve equation 1:\n\ndT(t)/dt = -n² * k * T(t)\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C * e^(-n² * k * t)\n\nNow, we combine the solutions for X(x) and T(t) to get the solution for u(x,t):\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[A_n * sin(n * x) * e^(-n² * k * t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = 4 * sin(3 * x):\n\n4 * sin(3 * x) = ∑[A_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nComparing the terms, we find that A_3 = 4 and all other A_n = 0. Thus, the final solution for u(x,t) is:\n\nu(x,t) = 4 * sin(3 * x) * e^(-9 * k * t)"
