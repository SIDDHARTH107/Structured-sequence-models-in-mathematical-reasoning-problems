    "message_2": "To find the maximum height the ladder can reach along the wall, we can use the sine function in the context of a right triangle. The ladder forms a right triangle with the ground and the wall, with the angle between the ladder and the ground being 60 degrees.\n\nWe can use the sine function as follows:\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the opposite side is the height along the wall (which we want to find), and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder (12 meters).\n\nsin(60) = height / 12\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12:\n\nheight = 12 * sin(60)\n\nThe sine of 60 degrees is equal to 0.866 (rounded to three decimal places). Therefore:\n\nheight = 12 * 0.866\n\nheight â‰ˆ 10.4 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height the ladder can reach along the wall is approximately 10.4 meters, rounded to the nearest tenth of a meter."
