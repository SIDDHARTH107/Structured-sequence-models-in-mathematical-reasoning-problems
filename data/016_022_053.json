    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal structure created by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of triangular faces at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal Triangular Faces = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the level of the Sierpinski pyramid.\n\nFor a Sierpinski pyramid constructed to the fourth level (n = 4):\n\nTotal Triangular Faces = 4^4 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid constructed to the fourth level."
