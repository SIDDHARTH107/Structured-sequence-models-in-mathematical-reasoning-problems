    "message_2": "A group of order 18 has the prime factorization 18 = 2 * 3^2. According to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, the possible structures of abelian groups of order 18 are:\n\n1. C18 (cyclic group of order 18)\n2. C2 x C9 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 9)\n3. C3 x C6 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 6)\n\nNow, let's find the possible number of cyclic subgroups for each of these groups.\n\n1. C18: The cyclic group of order 18 has subgroups of order 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Therefore, there are 6 cyclic subgroups in total.\n\n2. C2 x C9: This group has cyclic subgroups of order 1, 2, 3, and 9. There are 4 cyclic subgroups in total.\n\n3. C3 x C6: This group has cyclic subgroups of order 1, 2, 3, and 6. There are 4 cyclic subgroups in total.\n\nNow, let's determine which of these groups are isomorphic to the given groups:\n\n- C18: The cyclic group of order 18 is isomorphic to itself.\n- Non-abelian group of order 18: None of the groups listed above are non-abelian, so none of them are isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18.\n- Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6: The group C3 x C6 is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nIn summary, there are 6, 4, and 4 cyclic subgroups for the groups C18, C2 x C9, and C3 x C6, respectively. The group C18 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18, and the group C3 x C6 is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6. None of the groups are isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18."
