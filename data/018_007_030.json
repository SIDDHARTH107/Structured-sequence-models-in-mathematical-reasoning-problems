    "message_2": "Let A be a set with 3 elements, i.e., A = {a, b, c}. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.\n\nThe power set P(A) can be constructed as follows:\n\nP(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}\n\nWe can see that P(A) has 8 elements. Now, let's compare the number of elements in P(A) with the number of elements in A:\n\n|P(A)| = 8\n|A| = 3\n\nClearly, the number of elements in the power set P(A) is greater than the number of elements in the set A.\n\nTo prove that the number of elements in the power set is always greater than the number of elements in the set A, let's consider a set A with n elements. The power set P(A) will have 2^n elements, as each element can either be included or excluded from a subset.\n\nFor any positive integer n, we have:\n\n2^n > n\n\nThis can be proven by induction:\n\nBase case: n = 1\n2^1 = 2 > 1\n\nInductive step: Assume 2^n > n for some positive integer n. We want to show that 2^(n+1) > n+1.\n\n2^(n+1) = 2 * 2^n (by the properties of exponents)\nSince 2^n > n (by the inductive hypothesis), we have:\n2 * 2^n > 2 * n\n\nNow, we need to show that 2 * n > n + 1 for n ≥ 1. This is true because:\n\n2 * n > n + 1\nn > 1\n\nSince n is a positive integer, the inequality holds, and thus 2^(n+1) > n+1.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality 2^n > n holds for all positive integers n. Therefore, the number of elements in the power set is always greater than the number of elements in the set A."
