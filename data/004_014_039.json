    "message_2": "To find the volume of the conical water tank using integration, we'll first set up the integral. We'll use the disk method, which involves summing up the volumes of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin disks that make up the cone.\n\nConsider a small disk of thickness 'dy' at a height 'y' from the bottom of the cone. The radius of this disk, 'r', is proportional to its height 'y'. Since the radius of the base of the cone is 5 meters and the height is 10 meters, we can use similar triangles to find the proportionality constant:\n\nr / y = 5 / 10\nr = (1/2) * y\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the infinitesimally thin disk:\n\ndV = π * r^2 * dy\ndV = π * ((1/2) * y)^2 * dy\ndV = (π/4) * y^2 * dy\n\nTo find the volume of the entire cone, we'll integrate this expression with respect to 'y' from 0 to 10:\n\nV = ∫(π/4) * y^2 dy from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral:\n\nV = (π/4) * ∫y^2 dy from 0 to 10\nV = (π/4) * [ (1/3) * y^3 ] from 0 to 10\nV = (π/12) * (10^3 - 0^3)\nV = (π/12) * 1000\nV = (250/3) * π\n\nSo, the volume of the conical water tank is (250/3)π cubic meters."
