    "message_2": "To find the length of the Peano curve after the first 4 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (Number of line segments per iteration)^(Number of iterations) / (Scale factor)^(Number of iterations)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, the number of line segments per iteration is 8, the scale factor is 3, and the number of iterations is 4.\n\nLength = 1 * (8^4) / (3^4)\nLength = 1 * (4096) / (81)\nLength = 4096 / 81\nLength â‰ˆ 50.5679\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve after the first 4 iterations is approximately 50.5679."
