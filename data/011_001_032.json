    "message_2": "To determine the number of different groups of 3 people that can be selected from 5 people, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations, n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to be chosen, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (total number of people) and k = 3 (number of people to be chosen).\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\n\nC(5, 3) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 × 2)\n\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 different groups of 3 people that can be selected to ride in the car."
