    "message_1": "In a factor analysis of a set of 10 variables, a researcher finds that the first factor explains 30% of the variance, the second factor explains 25% of the variance, and the third factor explains 15% of the variance. What percentage of the variance is explained by the remaining factors?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of the variance explained by the remaining factors, we first need to determine the total percentage of variance explained by the first three factors. \n\nThe first factor explains 30% of the variance, the second factor explains 25%, and the third factor explains 15%. \n\nSo, the total percentage of variance explained by these three factors is:\n\n30% + 25% + 15% = 70%\n\nSince the total variance is 100%, the percentage of variance explained by the remaining factors is:\n\n100% - 70% = 30%\n\nThus, the remaining factors explain 30% of the variance."
