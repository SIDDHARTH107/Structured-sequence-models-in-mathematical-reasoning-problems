    "message_1": "A trapezium has one base measuring 8 centimeters, another base measuring 12 centimeters, and the height is 5 centimeters. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides (the non-parallel sides). Since we don't have enough information to directly find these lengths, we can use the Pythagorean theorem if the trapezium is an isosceles trapezium (both non-parallel sides are equal in length).\n\nLet's assume it's an isosceles trapezium. In this case, we can draw a line from one of the vertices of the smaller base (8 cm) perpendicular to the larger base (12 cm), creating two right triangles. The height of the trapezium (5 cm) will be the height of these right triangles.\n\nNow, we can find the length of the base of each right triangle. Since the trapezium is isosceles, the larger base (12 cm) is divided equally by the two right triangles. So, the base of each right triangle is (12 - 8) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the non-parallel sides (hypotenuse of the right triangles):\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n2^2 + 5^2 = c^2\n4 + 25 = c^2\n29 = c^2\nc = √29\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = smaller base + larger base + 2 * non-parallel side\nPerimeter = 8 + 12 + 2 * √29\nPerimeter ≈ 20 + 2 * 5.39\nPerimeter ≈ 20 + 10.78\nPerimeter ≈ 30.78 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 30.78 centimeters."
