    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal x(t) = 2cos(5t) + 3sin(8t) for t >= 0, we need to compute the Fourier transform of each term separately and then add them together. \n\nThe Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal x(t) is given by:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1) and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of the first term, 2cos(5t):\n\nX1(ω) = ∫[2cos(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt for t >= 0\n\nSince the signal is defined only for t >= 0, we need to multiply the signal by a unit step function u(t):\n\nX1(ω) = ∫[2cos(5t) * e^(-jωt) * u(t)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, let's integrate:\n\nX1(ω) = 2 ∫[cos(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = cos(5t), dv = e^(-jωt) dt\ndu = -5sin(5t) dt, v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\nX1(ω) = 2[-(cos(5t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt)) - ∫(-5sin(5t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we need to find the second integral:\n\n∫(5sin(5t) * (1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nAgain, we use integration by parts:\n\nu = sin(5t), dv = (1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt\ndu = 5cos(5t) dt, v = (-1/j^2ω^2)e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, we substitute back into the expression for X1(ω):\n\nX1(ω) = 2[-(cos(5t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt)) - 5 ∫(cos(5t) * (-1/j^2ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nX1(ω) = 2[-(cos(5t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt)) + 5 ∫(cos(5t) * (1/j^2ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we evaluate the limits:\n\nX1(ω) = 2[-(cos(5t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt))|₀^∞ + 5 ∫(cos(5t) * (1/j^2ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the exponential term e^(-jωt) goes to zero, and the cosine term oscillates between -1 and 1. Therefore, the first term goes to zero:\n\nX1(ω) = 2[0 - (cos(5(0)) * (-1/jω)e^(-jω(0))) + 5 ∫(cos(5t) * (1/j^2ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nX1(ω) = 2[1/jω + 5 ∫(cos(5t) * (1/j^2ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the second term, 3sin(8t):\n\nX2(ω) = ∫[3sin(8t) * e^(-jωt) * u(t)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nUsing a similar process as before:\n\nX2(ω) = 3 ∫[sin(8t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nIntegration by parts:\n\nu = sin(8t), dv = e^(-jωt) dt\ndu = 8cos(8t) dt, v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt)\n\nX2(ω) = 3[-(sin(8t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt)) - ∫(8cos(8t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nX2(ω) = 3[-(sin(8t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt)) + 8 ∫(cos(8t) * (1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nX2(ω) = 3[0 - (sin(8(0)) * (-1/jω)e^(-jω(0))) + 8 ∫(cos(8t) * (1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nX2(ω) = 3[0 + 8 ∫(cos(8t) * (1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we add the Fourier transforms of the two terms:\n\nX(ω) = X1(ω) + X2(ω)\n\nX(ω) = 2[1/jω + 5 ∫(cos(5t) * (1/j^2ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞ + 3[0 + 8 ∫(cos(8t) * (1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nUnfortunately, the integrals in the expression for X(ω) cannot be solved analytically, so the Fourier transform of the given signal x(t) = 2cos(5t) + 3sin(8t) for t >= 0 is:\n\nX(ω) = 2[1/jω + 5 ∫(cos(5t) * (1/j^2ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞ + 3[0 + 8 ∫(cos(8t) * (1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt)] from 0 to ∞"
