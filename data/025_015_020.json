    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface z = xy - x - y + 2 at the point (2, 1, 0), we first need to find the partial derivatives of the function with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y, z) = xy - x - y + 2 - z. We want to find the tangent plane to the level surface f(x, y, z) = 0 at the point (2, 1, 0).\n\nThe partial derivative of f with respect to x is:\nf_x = y - 1\n\nThe partial derivative of f with respect to y is:\nf_y = x - 1\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the given point (2, 1, 0):\n\nf_x(2, 1, 0) = 1 - 1 = 0\nf_y(2, 1, 0) = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane at the point (2, 1, 0) is given by:\n\nf_x(2, 1, 0)(x - 2) + f_y(2, 1, 0)(y - 1) + (z - 0) = 0\n\nSubstituting the values of f_x(2, 1, 0) and f_y(2, 1, 0):\n\n0(x - 2) + 1(y - 1) + (z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\ny + z - 1 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane is:\n\ny + z = 1"
