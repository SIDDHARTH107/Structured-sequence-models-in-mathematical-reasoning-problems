The density of water is 1000 kg/m$^3$ and its kinematic viscosity is 1.003 $\\times$ 10$^{-6}$ m$^2$/s. The plate is 2 m long and has a width of 0.3 m. Calculate the pressure gradient along the plate if the pressure at the leading edge of the plate is 101325 Pa and the pressure at the trailing edge of the plate is 100710 Pa.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure gradient along the plate, we need to find the change in pressure over the length of the plate. The pressure at the leading edge of the plate is given as 101325 Pa, and the pressure at the trailing edge of the plate is given as 100710 Pa. \n\nFirst, let's find the change in pressure:\nΔP = P_trailing - P_leading = 100710 Pa - 101325 Pa = -615 Pa\n\nNow, let's find the pressure gradient along the plate. The pressure gradient is defined as the change in pressure over the length of the plate:\n\nPressure gradient = ΔP / Length of the plate = -615 Pa / 2 m = -307.5 Pa/m\n\nSo, the pressure gradient along the plate is -307.5 Pa/m."
