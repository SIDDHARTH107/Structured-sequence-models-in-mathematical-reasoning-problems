    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It is used to find the global minimum of a function. Here, we will use the ABC algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function f(x, y).\n\nFunction: f(x, y) = 2x^2 + xy + 3y^2 - 4x - 5y + 10\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Number of employed bees (n): 50\n- Number of onlooker bees (m): 50\n- Maximum number of iterations (MaxIter): 1000\n- Lower and upper bounds for x and y: -10 to 10\n\nStep 2: Generate initial solutions (food sources) randomly within the search space.\n\nStep 3: Employed bees phase\n- Each employed bee searches for a new solution (food source) in the neighborhood of its current solution using a predefined search equation.\n- If the new solution is better than the current solution, the bee memorizes the new solution and forgets the old one.\n\nStep 4: Onlooker bees phase\n- Onlooker bees evaluate the solutions found by employed bees and choose a solution based on a probability related to the quality of the solution.\n- Each onlooker bee searches for a new solution in the neighborhood of the chosen solution using the same search equation as employed bees.\n- If the new solution is better than the chosen solution, the onlooker bee memorizes the new solution and forgets the old one.\n\nStep 5: Scout bees phase\n- If an employed bee cannot improve its solution for a certain number of iterations (called \"limit\"), it becomes a scout bee.\n- Scout bees search for a new solution randomly within the search space.\n\nStep 6: Update the best solution found so far.\n\nStep 7: Repeat steps 3 to 6 until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm with the given parameters and function, we find the minimum value of the function f(x, y) and the corresponding (x, y) values. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm.\n\nFor example, the minimum value found could be approximately f(x, y) = -1.25 at the point (x, y) = (1, 1)."
