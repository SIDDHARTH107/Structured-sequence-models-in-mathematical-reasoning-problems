    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to take the exterior derivative of each term in $\\omega$ and sum them up. Recall that the exterior derivative is a linear operator, so we can apply it to each term separately.\n\nFirst, let's take the exterior derivative of the term $x^2 dy \\wedge dz$:\n\n$$d(x^2 dy \\wedge dz) = d(x^2) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$$\n\nNow, $d(x^2) = 2x dx$, so we have:\n\n$$d(x^2 dy \\wedge dz) = (2x dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$$\n\nNext, let's take the exterior derivative of the term $y^2 dz \\wedge dx$:\n\n$$d(y^2 dz \\wedge dx) = d(y^2) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$$\n\nNow, $d(y^2) = 2y dy$, so we have:\n\n$$d(y^2 dz \\wedge dx) = (2y dy) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$$\n\nNow, we can sum up these two terms to get the exterior derivative $d\\omega$:\n\n$$d\\omega = (2x dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + (2y dy) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$$\n\nNow, let's evaluate $d\\omega |_p$ at the point $p = (1,2,3)$. We simply substitute the coordinates of $p$ into the expression for $d\\omega$:\n\n$$d\\omega |_p = (2(1) dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + (2(2) dy) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$$\n\n$$d\\omega |_p = 2 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + 4 dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ evaluated at the point $p = (1,2,3)$ is:\n\n$$d\\omega |_p = 2 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + 4 dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$$"
