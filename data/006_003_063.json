    "message_1": "A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards, of which 4 are Aces. If you draw 2 cards at random from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards, what is the probability that both of them are Aces?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both cards being Aces, we can use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes when drawing 2 cards from a deck of 52 cards. This can be calculated using combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of cards (52) and k is the number of cards we want to draw (2).\n\nC(52, 2) = 52! / (2!(52-2)!)\nC(52, 2) = 52! / (2!50!)\nC(52, 2) = (52*51) / (2*1)\nC(52, 2) = 2652\n\nNow, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw 2 Aces from the 4 Aces in the deck:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!)\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!2!)\nC(4, 2) = (4*3) / (2*1)\nC(4, 2) = 6\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 6 / 2652\nProbability = 1 / 442\n\nSo, the probability of drawing 2 Aces from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is 1/442 or approximately 0.00226."
