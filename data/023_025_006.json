    "message_1": "A sample of titanium has a mass of 10 grams and is heated until it reaches a temperature of 500°C. The specific heat capacity of titanium is known to be 0.523 J/g°C. Using the Fourier transform, determine the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of the titanium sample from 20°C to 500°C.",
    "message_2": "The Fourier transform is not applicable in this situation. Instead, we can use the formula for calculating the thermal energy (Q) required to change the temperature of a substance:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere:\nQ = thermal energy (Joules)\nm = mass of the substance (grams)\nc = specific heat capacity of the substance (J/g°C)\nΔT = change in temperature (°C)\n\nGiven:\nm = 10 g (mass of titanium)\nc = 0.523 J/g°C (specific heat capacity of titanium)\nInitial temperature (T1) = 20°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 500°C\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 500°C - 20°C\nΔT = 480°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the thermal energy (Q) required:\nQ = mcΔT\nQ = (10 g)(0.523 J/g°C)(480°C)\nQ = 10 * 0.523 * 480\nQ = 2510.4 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of the titanium sample from 20°C to 500°C is 2510.4 Joules."
