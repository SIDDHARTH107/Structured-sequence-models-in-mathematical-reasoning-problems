    "message_2": "To divide a set of 7 elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) counts the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.\n\nThe Bell numbers can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(n+1) = Î£[k=0 to n] C(n, k) * B(k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can calculate the Bell numbers for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7:\n\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\nB(6) = 203\nB(7) = 877\n\nSo, there are 877 different ways to divide a set of 7 elements into non-empty subsets."
