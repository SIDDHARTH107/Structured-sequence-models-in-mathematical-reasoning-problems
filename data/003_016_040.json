    "message_2": "The general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A sin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn the given function, y = 2sin(3x - π/4), we can see that A = 2, B = 3, and C = π/4.\n\nThe phase shift of the function is C, which is π/4 radians."
