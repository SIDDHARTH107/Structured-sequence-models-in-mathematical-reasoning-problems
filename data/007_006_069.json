    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 345 and 735 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (735) by the smaller number (345) and find the remainder.\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder obtained in step 1.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0. The GCD is the non-zero remainder obtained in the previous step.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\nStep 1:\n735 รท 345 = 2 with a remainder of 45\n\nStep 2:\nReplace 735 with 345 and 345 with 45\n\nStep 3:\n345 รท 45 = 7 with a remainder of 30\nReplace 345 with 45 and 45 with 30\n\n45 รท 30 = 1 with a remainder of 15\nReplace 45 with 30 and 30 with 15\n\n30 รท 15 = 2 with a remainder of 0\n\nThe remainder is now 0, so the GCD is the non-zero remainder obtained in the previous step, which is 15.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of 345 and 735 is 15."
