    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use related rates. First, let's find the relationship between the volume of the cone and its dimensions. The volume V of a cone is given by:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nSince the tank has a height of 12 feet and a base radius of 6 feet, we can find the ratio of the radius to the height:\n\nr/h = 6/12 = 1/2\n\nNow, let's differentiate the volume equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = (1/3)π(2r(dr/dt)h + r^2(dh/dt))\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = 8 cubic feet per minute. We want to find dh/dt when h = 4 feet. Using the ratio we found earlier, we can find the corresponding radius when h = 4 feet:\n\nr = (1/2)h = (1/2)(4) = 2 feet\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\n8 = (1/3)π(2(2)(dr/dt)(4) + (2^2)(dh/dt))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n8 = (8/3)π(dr/dt) + (4/3)π(dh/dt)\n\nSince r/h = 1/2, we have dr/dt = (1/2)(dh/dt). Now, substitute this into the equation:\n\n8 = (8/3)π((1/2)(dh/dt))(4) + (4/3)π(dh/dt)\n\n8 = (16/3)π(dh/dt) + (4/3)π(dh/dt)\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n8 = (20/3)π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = (8(3))/(20π) = 24/(20π) = 6/(5π)\n\nSo, the water level is rising at a rate of 6/(5π) feet per minute when the water is 4 feet deep."
