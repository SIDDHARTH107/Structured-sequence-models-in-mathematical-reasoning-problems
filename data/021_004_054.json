    "message_2": "First, let's find the value of the first derivative of f(x) at x = 3 using the central difference approximation with a spacing of h = 0.1.\n\nThe central difference approximation formula is:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)\n\nIn this case, x = 3 and h = 0.1. So, we have:\n\nf'(3) ≈ (f(3.1) - f(2.9)) / (2 * 0.1)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of f(3.1) and f(2.9) using the given function f(x) = x^2 - 4x:\n\nf(3.1) = (3.1)^2 - 4(3.1) = 9.61 - 12.4 = -2.79\nf(2.9) = (2.9)^2 - 4(2.9) = 8.41 - 11.6 = -3.19\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the central difference approximation formula:\n\nf'(3) ≈ (-2.79 - (-3.19)) / (2 * 0.1) = 0.4 / 0.2 = 2\n\nSo, the value of the first derivative of f(x) at x = 3 using the central difference approximation with a spacing of h = 0.1 is 2.\n\nNow, let's find the value of the definite integral of f(x) from x = 1 to x = 4 using the trapezoidal rule with a step size of h = 0.2.\n\nThe trapezoidal rule formula is:\n\n∫(a, b) f(x) dx ≈ (h / 2) * (f(a) + 2 * Σf(x_i) + f(b))\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and h = 0.2. We need to find the values of f(x) at x = 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, and 4.\n\nI will calculate the sum of the function values at the intermediate points:\n\nΣf(x_i) = f(1.2) + f(1.4) + f(1.6) + f(1.8) + f(2) + f(2.2) + f(2.4) + f(2.6) + f(2.8) + f(3) + f(3.2) + f(3.4) + f(3.6) + f(3.8)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the trapezoidal rule formula:\n\n∫(1, 4) f(x) dx ≈ (0.2 / 2) * (f(1) + 2 * Σf(x_i) + f(4))\n\nCalculating the integral:\n\n∫(1, 4) f(x) dx ≈ (0.2 / 2) * (-3 + 2 * (-20.4) - 4) = 0.1 * (-3 - 40.8 - 4) = 0.1 * (-47.8) = -4.78\n\nSo, the value of the definite integral of f(x) from x = 1 to x = 4 using the trapezoidal rule with a step size of h = 0.2 is -4.78."
