    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2 - x^2 from x = -1 to x = 1, we need to first find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2 - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 2\n\nx^2 = 1\n\nx = ±1\n\nNow, we can set up an integral to find the area between the curves. The area will be the integral of the difference between the two functions from x = -1 to x = 1:\n\nArea = ∫[-1,1] (2 - x^2 - x^2) dx\n\nArea = ∫[-1,1] (2 - 2x^2) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate the function:\n\nArea = [2x - (2/3)x^3] from -1 to 1\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nArea = (2(1) - (2/3)(1)^3) - (2(-1) - (2/3)(-1)^3)\n\nArea = (2 - 2/3) - (-2 + 2/3)\n\nArea = (4/3) - (-4/3)\n\nArea = 8/3\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2 - x^2 from x = -1 to x = 1 is 8/3 square units."
