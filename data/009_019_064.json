    "message_2": "Since the given stochastic differential equation (SDE) is linear, we can apply the integrating factor method to solve it. The SDE can be written as:\n\ndX(t) - aX(t)dt = bX(t)dW(t)\n\nNow, let's find the integrating factor, which is given by:\n\nI(t) = exp(-∫a dt) = exp(-2t)\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the SDE by the integrating factor:\n\nI(t)dX(t) - aI(t)X(t)dt = bI(t)X(t)dW(t)\n\nThe left-hand side is now an exact differential:\n\nd(I(t)X(t)) = bI(t)X(t)dW(t)\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d(I(t)X(t)) = ∫bI(t)X(t)dW(t)\n\nI(t)X(t) - I(0)X(0) = ∫bI(t)X(t)dW(t)\n\nNow, we need to find the stochastic integral on the right-hand side. Since the integrand is deterministic, we can use the Ito isometry to evaluate the integral:\n\n∫bI(t)X(t)dW(t) = b∫exp(-2t)X(t)dW(t)\n\nNow, we can use the Ito's formula to find the solution of the SDE:\n\nX(t) = X(0)exp(2t) + 0.5∫exp(-2s)X(s)dW(s)\n\nSince X(0) = 2, we have:\n\nX(t) = 2exp(2t) + 0.5∫exp(-2s)X(s)dW(s)\n\nNow, we want to find the solution at t = 1:\n\nX(1) = 2exp(2) + 0.5∫exp(-2s)X(s)dW(s) from 0 to 1\n\nSince b = 0.5, the SDE has no noise term, and the integral term becomes 0:\n\nX(1) = 2exp(2) + 0 = 2exp(2)\n\nSo, the solution of the given SDE at time t = 1 is:\n\nX(1) = 2exp(2) ≈ 14.7781"
