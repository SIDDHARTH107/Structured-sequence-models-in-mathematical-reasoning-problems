    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, the probability of a robbery occurring in any given month is 0.05. If the neighborhood has 400 households, what is the probability that at least 20 households will experience a robbery in a given month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (robberies) in n trials (households)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (robbery) in a single trial (household)\n- n is the number of trials (households)\n- k is the number of successes (robberies)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least 20 households experiencing a robbery, so we need to find the sum of probabilities for 20, 21, 22, ..., 400 robberies.\n\nP(X >= 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + ... + P(X = 400)\n\nWe know that:\n- n = 400 (number of households)\n- p = 0.05 (probability of a robbery in a given month)\n\nWe can calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up. However, calculating the probabilities for each value of k from 20 to 400 can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)]\n\nNow, we only need to calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 19 and sum them up. Then, subtract the sum from 1 to get the probability of at least 20 households experiencing a robbery.\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 19 and sum them up:\n\nsum = 0\nfor k in range(20):\n    C = math.comb(400, k)\n    p_k = C * (0.05 ** k) * (0.95 ** (400 - k))\n    sum += p_k\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - sum\n\nAfter calculating the sum and subtracting it from 1, we get:\n\nP(X >= 20) â‰ˆ 0.9821\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 households will experience a robbery in a given month is approximately 0.9821 or 98.21%."
