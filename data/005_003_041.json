She collects data from 20 students who reported their hours of studying and their grades, and uses simple linear regression to model the relationship between those variables. The resulting regression equation is:\n\nGrade = 32.5 + 2.75 * Hours of studying\n\n(a) What is the predicted grade for a student who studies 8 hours per week?\n(b) What is the slope of the regression line? What does it mean?\n(c) What is the correlation coefficient between the two variables? What does it indicate about the strength and direction of the relationship?",
    "message_2": "(a) To find the predicted grade for a student who studies 8 hours per week, we can plug the value of 8 into the regression equation:\n\nGrade = 32.5 + 2.75 * Hours of studying\nGrade = 32.5 + 2.75 * 8\nGrade = 32.5 + 22\nGrade = 54.5\n\nSo, the predicted grade for a student who studies 8 hours per week is 54.5.\n\n(b) The slope of the regression line is 2.75. This means that for every additional hour of studying per week, the predicted grade increases by 2.75 points. In other words, the more hours a student spends studying, the higher their predicted grade will be.\n\n(c) The correlation coefficient (r) is not given in the problem, so we cannot directly calculate it. However, we can discuss what it would indicate if we had the value. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with -1 indicating a perfect negative relationship, 1 indicating a perfect positive relationship, and 0 indicating no relationship. In this case, since the slope of the regression line is positive (2.75), we can infer that the correlation coefficient would be positive as well, indicating a positive relationship between hours of studying and the grade obtained. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the stronger the relationship between the two variables."
