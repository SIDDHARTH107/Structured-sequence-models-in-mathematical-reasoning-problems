    "message_1": "A city with a population of 500,000 people has been hit by a contagious disease. The rate at which the disease spreads is proportional to the number of infected people and the number of susceptible people. The number of susceptible people decreases by 200 per day, while the number of infected people increases by 50 per day. At the beginning of the outbreak, there were 25 infected people. Calculate the number of infected people after 10 days.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of infected people as I(t) and the number of susceptible people as S(t), where t is the number of days since the beginning of the outbreak.\n\nWe are given that the number of infected people increases by 50 per day, so we can write the equation for I(t) as:\n\nI(t) = 25 + 50t\n\nWe are also given that the number of susceptible people decreases by 200 per day. Since there were initially 500,000 people in the city, and 25 of them were infected, there were initially 500,000 - 25 = 499,975 susceptible people. So, we can write the equation for S(t) as:\n\nS(t) = 499,975 - 200t\n\nNow we want to find the number of infected people after 10 days, so we need to calculate I(10):\n\nI(10) = 25 + 50 * 10 = 25 + 500 = 525\n\nAfter 10 days, there will be 525 infected people in the city."
