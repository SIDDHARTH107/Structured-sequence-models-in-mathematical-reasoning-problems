    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm (FA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the FA to minimize the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 1.\n\nTo implement the FA, we need to define the following parameters and steps:\n\n1. Parameters:\n   - Number of fireflies (n): The number of candidate solutions in the search space.\n   - Attractiveness (beta): The attractiveness of a firefly at a distance r.\n   - Absorption coefficient (gamma): The absorption coefficient of the medium.\n   - Randomization parameter (alpha): The randomization parameter to control the randomness in the search process.\n   - Maximum iterations (max_iter): The maximum number of iterations for the algorithm.\n\n2. Steps:\n   a. Initialize the firefly population with random positions in the search space.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of each firefly (the value of the function f(x) at the firefly's position).\n   c. Update the attractiveness of each firefly based on its fitness.\n   d. Move the fireflies towards the more attractive (brighter) fireflies.\n   e. Update the positions of the fireflies and evaluate their new fitness values.\n   f. Repeat steps c to e until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the convergence criterion is met.\n\nAfter implementing the FA, the firefly with the lowest fitness value represents the optimal solution, and its position corresponds to the minimum value of the function f(x).\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the FA requires programming skills and the choice of appropriate parameter values. The performance of the algorithm depends on these choices and may vary across different runs. Therefore, it is recommended to run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best solution from all runs."
