Let $\\mathcal{O}_C (1)$ be the line bundle of degree 1 on $C$ and fix an ample line bundle $L$ of degree 3 on $C$. Let $H^1(C,\\mathcal{O}_C\\otimes L^{-n})$ be the first cohomology group of the sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_C\\otimes L^{-n}$. \n\nDetermine the value of $n$ such that $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C\\otimes L^{-n}) \\neq 0$.",
    "message_2": "To determine the value of $n$ such that $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C\\otimes L^{-n}) \\neq 0$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle $M$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$h^0(C, M) - h^1(C, M) = \\deg(M) + 1 - g$.\n\nIn our case, $M = \\mathcal{O}_C\\otimes L^{-n}$. Since $L$ has degree 3, $L^{-n}$ has degree $-3n$, and $\\mathcal{O}_C(1)$ has degree 1, so $\\deg(M) = 1 - 3n$. \n\nNow, we need to compute the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. Since $C$ is a complex projective curve of degree 4, it is a smooth quartic curve. The genus of a smooth quartic curve can be computed using the formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, $d = 4$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2} = 3$.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$h^0(C, M) - h^1(C, M) = (1 - 3n) + 1 - 3$.\n\nWe want to find the value of $n$ such that $h^1(C, M) \\neq 0$. Since $h^1(C, M) \\geq 0$, we need to find the value of $n$ such that $h^0(C, M) < h^1(C, M)$. From the Riemann-Roch theorem, this is equivalent to finding the value of $n$ such that:\n\n$(1 - 3n) + 1 - 3 < 0$.\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n$-3n < 1$.\n\nDividing by $-3$, we get:\n\n$n > \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies this inequality is $n = 1$. Therefore, $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C\\otimes L^{-n}) \\neq 0$ for $n = 1$."
