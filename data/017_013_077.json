    "message_2": "To determine the possible structures of G, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 18, which can be factored as 2 * 3^2. Therefore, we will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nLet n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, n_2 must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The only possibility for n_2 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G, say H, and it must be of order 2. Since H is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nLet n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, n_3 must divide 2, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 2. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say K, and it must be of order 9. Since K is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nIf both H and K are normal in G, then their product HK is also a subgroup of G, and |HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K| = 2 * 9 / 1 = 18, which means HK = G. Since H and K are both abelian (as they are of prime order), their direct product HK is also abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 (which is C3 × C6).\n\nIf n_3 = 2, then there are two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G, say K1 and K2. In this case, G cannot be abelian, as the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal in G. Thus, G must be a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to either the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 (C3 × C6) or a non-abelian group of order 18. G cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C18, as that would imply that G has a unique subgroup of order 9, which is not the case when n_3 = 2."
