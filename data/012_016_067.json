    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we can use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nHere, G is the graph, e is an edge, G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nThe given graph has no loops, so we don't need to consider the third case. We will use the first and second cases to compute the Tutte polynomial.\n\nLet's label the edges as follows:\n\n```\n         B-----C\n        /1\\    |4\n       /   \\   |\n      /2    3\\ |\n     A-------D-E\n         5\n```\n\nWe will start by considering edge 1:\n\n1. T(G - e1; x, y) = T(G - {A, B}; x, y)\n2. T(G / e1; x, y) = T(G / {A, B}; x, y)\n\nEdge 1 is not a bridge, so we can use the first case:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - {A, B}; x, y) + T(G / {A, B}; x, y)\n\nNow, we need to compute the Tutte polynomials for the two subgraphs.\n\nFor G - {A, B}:\n\n```\n         C\n         |\n         |\n         |\n     D---E\n```\n\nThis graph has no edges, so its Tutte polynomial is 1.\n\nFor G / {A, B}:\n\n```\n         B\n        / \\\n       /   \\\n      /     \\\n     A-------D-E\n```\n\nWe will consider edge 2:\n\n1. T(G / {A, B} - e2; x, y) = T(G / {A, B} - {A, D}; x, y)\n2. T(G / {A, B} / e2; x, y) = T(G / {A, B, D}; x, y)\n\nEdge 2 is a bridge, so we can use the second case:\n\nT(G / {A, B}; x, y) = x * T(G / {A, B} - {A, D}; x, y)\n\nFor G / {A, B} - {A, D}:\n\n```\n         B\n         |\n         |\n         |\n     A---E\n```\n\nThis graph has no edges, so its Tutte polynomial is 1.\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomial for G / {A, B}:\n\nT(G / {A, B}; x, y) = x * 1 = x\n\nFinally, we can compute the Tutte polynomial for the original graph:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - {A, B}; x, y) + T(G / {A, B}; x, y) = 1 + x\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is T(G; x, y) = 1 + x."
