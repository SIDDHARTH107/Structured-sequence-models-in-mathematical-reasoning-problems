The production processes are subject to random disturbances that cause fluctuations in the daily production levels. The profit per unit sold for product A is $10 and for product B is $8. The company wants to determine the optimal production plan that maximizes expected profit. Based on past data, the probability distribution for the production levels is given by:\n\nProduct A: Production levels follow a normal distribution with mean 80 and standard deviation 10.\nProduct B: Production levels follow a uniform distribution between 100 and 150.\n\nWhat is the optimal production plan for the company, and what is the expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production plan, we need to calculate the expected profit for each product and then find the combination that maximizes the total expected profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected profit for each product:\n\nProduct A:\nThe profit per unit is $10. The production levels follow a normal distribution with mean 80 and standard deviation 10. To find the expected profit, we need to multiply the profit per unit by the expected production level (mean).\n\nExpected Profit for Product A = Profit per unit * Mean production level\n= $10 * 80\n= $800\n\nProduct B:\nThe profit per unit is $8. The production levels follow a uniform distribution between 100 and 150. To find the expected profit, we need to multiply the profit per unit by the expected production level (mean of the uniform distribution).\n\nThe mean of a uniform distribution is given by (a + b) / 2, where a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the distribution.\n\nMean production level for Product B = (100 + 150) / 2\n= 250 / 2\n= 125\n\nExpected Profit for Product B = Profit per unit * Mean production level\n= $8 * 125\n= $1000\n\nNow, let's find the optimal production plan:\n\nSince the company can produce up to 100 units of product A and up to 150 units of product B per day, the optimal production plan is to produce at the expected production levels (80 units of product A and 125 units of product B) to maximize the expected profit.\n\nExpected Profit = Expected Profit for Product A + Expected Profit for Product B\n= $800 + $1000\n= $1800\n\nSo, the optimal production plan for the company is to produce 80 units of product A and 125 units of product B per day, with an expected profit of $1800 per day."
