After one year, the population has doubled to 40 rabbits. Using a differential equation, find the formula for the rabbit population as a function of time.",
    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t (in years). Since the growth rate is proportional to the current population, we can write the differential equation as:\n\ndP/dt = k * P(t)\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population with respect to time, and k is the proportionality constant.\n\nAt the start of the experiment, there are 20 rabbits, so P(0) = 20. After one year, the population doubles to 40 rabbits, so P(1) = 40.\n\nTo solve the differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = k * dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫k dt\n\nln|P| = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 20:\n\nln|20| = k * 0 + C\n\nC = ln|20|\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln|P| = kt + ln|20|\n\nTo find the value of k, we can use the condition P(1) = 40:\n\nln|40| = k * 1 + ln|20|\n\nln(2) = k\n\nNow we have the values of k and C, so we can write the final equation for the rabbit population as a function of time:\n\nln|P| = ln(2) * t + ln|20|\n\nP(t) = e^(ln(2) * t + ln|20|)\n\nUsing the property of exponentials, we can rewrite this as:\n\nP(t) = e^(ln(2) * t) * e^(ln|20|)\n\nSince e^(ln(x)) = x, we get:\n\nP(t) = 2^t * 20\n\nSo the formula for the rabbit population as a function of time is:\n\nP(t) = 20 * 2^t"
