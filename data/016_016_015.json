    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a space-filling fractal curve. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 7/3. \n\nLet L be the initial side length of the Gosper curve, which is given as 1 unit. After the 5th iteration, the length of the curve will be:\n\nL * (7/3)^5\n\nSubstituting the given value of L:\n\n1 * (7/3)^5 = (7^5) / (3^5) = 16807 / 243\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Gosper curve after the 5th iteration is approximately 69.164 units."
