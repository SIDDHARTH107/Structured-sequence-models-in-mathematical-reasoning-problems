    "message_2": "To find all integers x such that x² is congruent to 5 (mod 7), we need to find all x for which x² ≡ 5 (mod 7) holds true.\n\nWe can test all possible residues modulo 7 to see if any of them satisfy the given congruence. The possible residues modulo 7 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nLet's test each residue:\n\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3² ≡ 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n4² ≡ 16 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n5² ≡ 25 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n6² ≡ 36 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nWe can see that none of the residues modulo 7 satisfy the given congruence x² ≡ 5 (mod 7). Therefore, there are no integers x such that x² is congruent to 5 (mod 7)."
