    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 7, so a connected graph must have at least 6 edges. Since G has 10 edges, it is possible that it is connected.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any disconnected components. The maximum number of edges in a graph with 7 vertices is given by the formula:\n\nmax_edges = n * (n-1) / 2\n\nIn this case, max_edges = 7 * (7-1) / 2 = 21\n\nSince G has 10 edges, it has 21 - 10 = 11 fewer edges than the maximum possible. This means that there could be disconnected components.\n\nTo find the number of connected components, we can use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nLet's consider the possible connected components:\n\n1. A single connected component with 7 vertices: In this case, the sum of the degrees would be at least 2 * (7-1) = 12, which is less than 20. Therefore, G cannot have a single connected component with 7 vertices.\n\n2. Two connected components: In this case, one component could have 4 vertices and the other could have 3 vertices. The sum of the degrees for the 4-vertex component would be at least 2 * (4-1) = 6, and the sum of the degrees for the 3-vertex component would be at least 2 * (3-1) = 4. The total sum of the degrees would be 6 + 4 = 10, which is less than 20. Therefore, G cannot have two connected components with 4 and 3 vertices.\n\n3. Three connected components: In this case, one component could have 3 vertices, and the other two components could have 2 vertices each. The sum of the degrees for the 3-vertex component would be at least 2 * (3-1) = 4, and the sum of the degrees for each 2-vertex component would be 2. The total sum of the degrees would be 4 + 2 + 2 = 8, which is less than 20. Therefore, G cannot have three connected components with 3, 2, and 2 vertices.\n\nSince none of these cases are possible, G must be a connected graph."
