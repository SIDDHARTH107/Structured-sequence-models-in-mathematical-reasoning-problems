    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 10, so a connected graph must have at least 10-1 = 9 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 15 edges, which is more than the minimum required for a connected graph, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as it could still be disconnected with extra edges within the disconnected components.\n\nTo further investigate, let's consider the maximum number of edges a disconnected graph with 10 vertices can have. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is split into two disconnected components, one with 1 vertex and the other with 9 vertices. The component with 9 vertices can have at most (9 * (9 - 1)) / 2 = 36 edges, but since the graph has only 15 edges, it is not possible for the graph to be disconnected in this manner.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges is connected."
