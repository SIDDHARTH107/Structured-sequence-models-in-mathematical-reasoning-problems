    "message_2": "To find the maximum volume of a sphere that can be inscribed in the cube, we first need to determine the side length of the cube. Since the volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the side length, we can find the side length by taking the cube root of the volume:\n\ns = (125)^(1/3)\ns = 5 units\n\nNow that we know the side length of the cube, we can find the diameter of the inscribed sphere. The diameter of the sphere will be equal to the side length of the cube, so the diameter is 5 units. The radius of the sphere will be half of the diameter:\n\nr = 5/2\nr = 2.5 units\n\nFinally, we can find the volume of the inscribed sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = (4/3)πr^3:\n\nV = (4/3)π(2.5)^3\nV ≈ (4/3)π(15.625)\nV ≈ 65.45 cubic units\n\nSo, the maximum volume of a sphere that can be inscribed in the cube is approximately 65.45 cubic units."
