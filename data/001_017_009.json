    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+8) - log(x-2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this property to the given equation, we get:\n\nlog((x+8)/(x-2)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log(a) = b, then a = 10^b. Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\n(x+8)/(x-2) = 10^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(x+8)/(x-2) = 100\n\nNow, to solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\nx + 8 = 100(x - 2)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nx + 8 = 100x - 200\n\nNow, we can move all the terms involving x to one side of the equation:\n\nx - 100x = -200 - 8\n\n-99x = -208\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by -99 to solve for x:\n\nx = -208 / -99\n\nx ≈ 2.101\n\nSo, the solution to the equation log(x+8) - log(x-2) = 2 is x ≈ 2.101."
