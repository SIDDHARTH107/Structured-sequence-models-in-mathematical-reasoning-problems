    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student in epistemic logic:\n\nSuppose there are two mathematicians, John and Sarah, each of whom know a secret number. John's number is the sum of the digits in Sarah's number, while Sarah's number is the product of the digits in John's number. They have the following conversation:\nJohn: \"I don't know your number.\"\nSarah: \"I knew that you didn't know my number.\"\nJohn: \"Now I know your number.\"\n\nWhat are the secret numbers that John and Sarah know?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote John's number as J and Sarah's number as S. We know that J is the sum of the digits in S, and S is the product of the digits in J.\n\nFrom John's first statement, we can infer that his number cannot be a sum that corresponds to a unique product. In other words, there must be at least two possible values for S that have the same sum of digits. Let's list down the possible values of J (sum of digits) and their corresponding values of S (product of digits):\n\nJ = 1: Not possible, as there is no two-digit number with a sum of 1.\nJ = 2: S = 11 (1+1 = 2)\nJ = 3: S = 12 (1+2 = 3)\nJ = 4: S = 13 (1+3 = 4), S = 22 (2+2 = 4)\nJ = 5: S = 14 (1+4 = 5), S = 23 (2+3 = 5)\nJ = 6: S = 15 (1+5 = 6), S = 24 (2+4 = 6), S = 33 (3+3 = 6)\nJ = 7: S = 16 (1+6 = 7), S = 25 (2+5 = 7), S = 34 (3+4 = 7)\nJ = 8: S = 17 (1+7 = 8), S = 26 (2+6 = 8), S = 35 (3+5 = 8), S = 44 (4+4 = 8)\nJ = 9: S = 18 (1+8 = 9), S = 27 (2+7 = 9), S = 36 (3+6 = 9), S = 45 (4+5 = 9)\nJ = 10: S = 19 (1+9 = 10), S = 28 (2+8 = 10), S = 37 (3+7 = 10), S = 46 (4+6 = 10), S = 55 (5+5 = 10)\nJ = 11: S = 29 (2+9 = 11), S = 38 (3+8 = 11), S = 47 (4+7 = 11), S = 56 (5+6 = 11)\nJ = 12: S = 39 (3+9 = 12), S = 48 (4+8 = 12), S = 57 (5+7 = 12)\nJ = 13: S = 49 (4+9 = 13), S = 58 (5+8 = 13)\nJ = 14: S = 59 (5+9 = 14)\nJ = 15: Not possible, as there is no two-digit number with a sum of 15.\n\nFrom Sarah's statement, we can eliminate the cases where there is only one possible value for J, since she knew that John didn't know her number. This leaves us with the following possibilities:\n\nJ = 4: S = 13, S = 22\nJ = 5: S = 14, S = 23\nJ = 6: S = 15, S = 24, S = 33\nJ = 7: S = 16, S = 25, S = 34\nJ = 8: S = 17, S = 26, S = 35, S = 44\nJ = 9: S = 18, S = 27, S = 36, S = 45\nJ = 10: S = 19, S = 28, S = 37, S = 46, S = 55\nJ = 11: S = 29, S = 38, S = 47, S = 56\nJ = 12: S = 39, S = 48, S = 57\nJ = 13: S = 49, S = 58\n\nNow, John's second statement tells us that there must be only one possible value for S in the remaining options that has a unique product of digits. Let's check the product of digits for the remaining values of S:\n\nS = 13: J = 1×3 = 3\nS = 22: J = 2×2 = 4\nS = 14: J = 1×4 = 4\nS = 23: J = 2×3 = 6\nS = 15: J = 1×5 = 5\nS = 24: J = 2×4 = 8\nS = 33: J = 3×3 = 9\nS = 16: J = 1×6 = 6\nS = 25: J = 2×5 = 10\nS = 34: J = 3×4 = 12\nS = 17: J = 1×7 = 7\nS = 26: J = 2×6 = 12\nS = 35: J = 3×5 = 15\nS = 44: J = 4×4 = 16\nS = 18: J = 1×8 = 8\nS = 27: J = 2×7 = 14\nS = 36: J = 3×6 = 18\nS = 45: J = 4×5 = 20\nS = 19: J = 1×9 = 9\nS = 28: J = 2×8 = 16\nS = 37: J = 3×7 = 21\nS = 46: J = 4×6 = 24\nS = 55: J = 5×5 = 25\nS = 29: J = 2×9 = 18\nS = 38: J = 3×8 = 24\nS = 47: J = 4×7 = 28\nS = 56: J = 5×6 = 30\nS = 39: J = 3×9 = 27\nS = 48: J = 4×8 = 32\nS = 57: J = 5×7 = 35\nS = 49: J = 4×9 = 36\nS = 58: J = 5×8 = 40\n\nFrom the list above, we can see that only S = 13 has a unique product of digits (J = 3) among the remaining options. Therefore, John's number is 4, and Sarah's number is 13."
