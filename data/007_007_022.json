    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 5x + 7y = 23 for integers x and y, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution and then use the general solution formula for Diophantine equations.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 5 and 7 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n7 = 1 * 5 + 2\n5 = 2 * 2 + 1\n\nNow, we work our way back up:\n\n1 = 5 - 2 * 2\n1 = 5 - 2 * (7 - 1 * 5)\n1 = 3 * 5 - 2 * 7\n\nSo, the coefficients for the Bezout's identity are 3 and -2. Now we multiply both sides of the equation by 23:\n\n23 = (3 * 5 - 2 * 7) * 23\n23 = 69 * 5 - 46 * 7\n\nThus, a particular solution is x = 69 and y = -46. Now, we can find the general solution using the formula:\n\nx = x0 + (b/gcd(a, b)) * t\ny = y0 - (a/gcd(a, b)) * t\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions, a and b are the coefficients of the Diophantine equation, gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b, and t is an integer.\n\nIn our case, x0 = 69, y0 = -46, a = 5, b = 7, and gcd(a, b) = 1. So, the general solution is:\n\nx = 69 + 7t\ny = -46 - 5t\n\nFor example, when t = 1, we have x = 69 + 7 * 1 = 76 and y = -46 - 5 * 1 = -51, which also satisfies the equation 5x + 7y = 23."
