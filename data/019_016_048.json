    "message_1": "Suppose there are 50 students in a class. If 25 students like apples and 20 like bananas, how many students like both?",
    "message_2": "We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. Let A be the number of students who like apples, B be the number of students who like bananas, and C be the total number of students in the class. We are given:\n\nA = 25\nB = 20\nC = 50\n\nWe want to find the number of students who like both apples and bananas, which we will call X. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n\nC = A + B - X\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n50 = 25 + 20 - X\n\nSolving for X, we have:\n\nX = 25 + 20 - 50\nX = 45 - 50\nX = -5\n\nHowever, it is not possible to have a negative number of students who like both apples and bananas. This means that there is not enough information provided to determine the number of students who like both apples and bananas. We would need additional information, such as the number of students who like neither apples nor bananas or the number of students who like only one of the fruits."
