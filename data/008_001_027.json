    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first need to write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\nx + 2y - z = 3\n2x - 4y + 3z = -8\n3x - 6y + 4z = -5\n\nWe can write this system in the matrix form as follows:\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2 -4  3 |\n    | 3 -6  4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  3  |\n    | -8  |\n    | -5  |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)) and then multiply it by matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = 1(-24 + 12) - 2(8 - 9) - 1(-12 + 18)\n       = 1(-12) - 2(-1) - 1(6)\n       = -12 + 2 - 6\n       = -16\n\nSince the determinant of matrix A is non-zero, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nadj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A, which is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A.\n\nCofactors of A:\n\nC11 = (-24 + 12) = -12\nC12 = (8 - 9) = -1\nC13 = (-12 + 18) = 6\nC21 = (12 - 6) = 6\nC22 = (-4 + 3) = -1\nC23 = (6 - 8) = -2\nC31 = (-12 + 18) = 6\nC32 = (6 - 8) = -2\nC33 = (-4 + 6) = 2\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of matrix A:\n\nadj(A) = | -12 -1  6 |\n         |  6  -1 -2 |\n         |  6  -2  2 |\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-16) * adj(A)\n\nA^(-1) = |  3/4  1/16 -3/8  |\n         | -3/8  1/16  1/8  |\n         | -3/8  1/8  -1/8  |\n\nNow, let's multiply A^(-1) by B to get the solution matrix X:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  3/4  1/16 -3/8  |  |  3  |\n    | -3/8  1/16  1/8  |  | -8  |\n    | -3/8  1/8  -1/8  |  | -5  |\n\nX = | (3/4)(3) + (1/16)(-8) + (-3/8)(-5) |\n    | (-3/8)(3) + (1/16)(-8) + (1/8)(-5) |\n    | (-3/8)(3) + (1/8)(-8) + (-1/8)(-5) |\n\nX = | 9/4 - 1/2 + 15/8 |\n    | -9/8 - 1/2 - 5/8 |\n    | -9/8 - 1 + 5/8 |\n\nX = | 23/8 |\n    | -3/2 |\n    | -1/8 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 23/8\ny = -3/2\nz = -1/8"
