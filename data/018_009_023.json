    "message_2": "To find (A x B) x C and A x (B x C), we first need to understand the Cartesian product of sets. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nLet's first find A x B:\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow let's find (A x B) x C:\n(A x B) x C = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\nNow let's find B x C:\nB x C = {(4, 6), (5, 6)}\n\nNow let's find A x (B x C):\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nNow we need to prove that (A x B) x C = A x (B x C). To do this, we will show that the two sets have the same elements.\n\nNotice that the elements of (A x B) x C are of the form ((a, b), c) and the elements of A x (B x C) are of the form (a, (b, c)). We can rewrite the elements of (A x B) x C as (a, (b, c)) to match the form of the elements in A x (B x C):\n\n(A x B) x C = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that they have the same elements:\n\n(A x B) x C = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nSince (A x B) x C and A x (B x C) have the same elements, we can conclude that (A x B) x C = A x (B x C)."
