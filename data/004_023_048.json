    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = 2x^2 - 4x and y = 4 - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\n2x^2 - 4x = 4 - x^2\n\nNow, solve for x:\n3x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -4, and c = -4:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(3)(-4))) / (2(3))\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 48)) / 6\nx = (4 ± √64) / 6\nx = (4 ± 8) / 6\n\nThe two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = (4 + 8) / 6 = 12 / 6 = 2\nx = (4 - 8) / 6 = -4 / 6 = -2/3\n\nSo, the points of intersection are x = -2/3 and x = 2. Now, we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. We will integrate the difference between the two functions with respect to x, from -2/3 to 2:\n\nArea = ∫((-2/3), 2) [(4 - x^2) - (2x^2 - 4x)] dx\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫((-2/3), 2) [4 - x^2 - 2x^2 + 4x] dx\nArea = ∫((-2/3), 2) [-3x^2 + 4x + 4] dx\n\nNow, integrate the function with respect to x:\n\nArea = [-x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x] (from -2/3 to 2)\n\nEvaluate the antiderivative at the bounds:\n\nArea = [(-8 + 8 + 8) - ((-8/27) + (8/9) - (8/3))]\nArea = [8 - (-8/27 + 16/27)]\nArea = 8 - 8/27\nArea = (216 - 8) / 27\nArea = 208 / 27\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = 2x^2 - 4x and y = 4 - x^2 is 208/27 square units."
