    "message_2": "There is no general maximum number of steps for a Turing machine to halt on an input of n symbols. The number of steps required for a Turing machine to halt depends on the specific Turing machine and the problem it is designed to solve. Some Turing machines may halt quickly, while others may take a very long time or even never halt at all. In the latter case, the Turing machine is said to run forever or be non-halting."
