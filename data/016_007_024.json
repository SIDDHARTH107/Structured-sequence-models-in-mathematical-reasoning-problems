    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a cube into 27 smaller cubes and removing the central cube and the six cubes that share a face with the central cube. This leaves 20 cubes in each iteration.\n\nIn a level 4 Menger sponge, this process is repeated 4 times. The total number of cubes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^level\n\nFor a level 4 Menger sponge:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^4 = 160,000\n\nSo, there are 160,000 cubes in a level 4 Menger sponge."
