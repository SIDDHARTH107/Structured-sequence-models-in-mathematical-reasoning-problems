    "message_2": "First, we need to compute the degree of the divisor $2C$. Since $C$ is given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$, it is a smooth elliptic curve of genus $g = 1$. By the degree-genus formula, we have:\n\n$2g - 2 = deg(K_C) = deg(3C - 4E)$,\n\nwhere $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$ and $E$ is the divisor of a line in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. Therefore, we get:\n\n$deg(3C - 4E) = -2$.\n\nNow, we can compute the degree of $2C$:\n\n$deg(2C) = 2deg(C) = 2(deg(3C - 4E) + 2) = 2(4) = 8$.\n\nNext, we need to compute the degree of the tensor product $L \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})}(2)$. Since $L$ is associated to the divisor $2C$, we have:\n\n$deg(L \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})}(2)) = deg(2C) + deg(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})}(2)) = 8 + 2 = 10$.\n\nNow, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$, which states that for any line bundle $M$ on $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$:\n\n$h^0(\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C}), M) - h^1(\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C}), M) = deg(M) + 1$.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$ is a rational curve, we have $h^1(\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C}), M) = 0$ for any line bundle $M$. Therefore, we get:\n\n$h^0(\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C}), L \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})}(2)) = deg(L \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})}(2)) + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11$.\n\nSo, the dimension of the space of global sections $H^0(\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C}), L \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})}(2))$ is 11."
