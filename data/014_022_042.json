    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair ciphertext, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair square using the key \"MATHS\". \n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS (no duplicates in this case)\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet in order (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher): MATHSBCDEFGIKLNOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nNow we have the Playfair square:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNext, we will decrypt the ciphertext \"ILVFDGIRRKCA\" using the Playfair square:\n\n1. Break the ciphertext into digraphs: IL VF DG IR RK CA\n2. For each digraph, find the corresponding plaintext letters using the Playfair square rules:\n\n- IL: I and L are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left: HE\n- VF: V and F are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left: LU\n- DG: D and G are in the same column, so replace them with the letters above them: BM\n- IR: I and R are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle and replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corner: EA\n- RK: R and K are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle and replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corner: TT\n- CA: C and A are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left: BS\n\n3. Combine the decrypted digraphs: HELUBMEATTSB\n\nThe decrypted plaintext message is \"HELUBMEATTSB\"."
