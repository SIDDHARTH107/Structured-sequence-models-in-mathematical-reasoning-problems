    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of regions that can be created when the graph is drawn on a plane without any edge intersection, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (regions including the outer region).\n\nIn this case, we have V = 6 and E = 9. We want to find the maximum value of F.\n\nPlugging the values into Euler's formula:\n\n6 - 9 + F = 2\n\nSolving for F:\n\nF = 2 - 6 + 9\nF = 5\n\nSo, the maximum number of regions that can be created when the graph is drawn on a plane without any edge intersection is 5."
