    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a stock price increase on a certain day is 0.6, and the probability of a stock price decrease is 0.4. If the current price of the stock is $100, what is the expected value of the stock price at the end of the day?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the stock price at the end of the day, we need to know the possible outcomes and their probabilities. Let's assume that the stock price increases by $10 when it goes up and decreases by $10 when it goes down.\n\nPossible outcomes:\n1. Stock price increases to $110 with a probability of 0.6.\n2. Stock price decreases to $90 with a probability of 0.4.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value using the formula:\n\nExpected Value = (Outcome 1 * Probability 1) + (Outcome 2 * Probability 2)\n\nExpected Value = ($110 * 0.6) + ($90 * 0.4)\nExpected Value = $66 + $36\nExpected Value = $102\n\nSo, the expected value of the stock price at the end of the day is $102."
