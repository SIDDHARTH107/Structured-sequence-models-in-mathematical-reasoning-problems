    "message_1": "In a school club, there are 10 students who want to form a committee consisting of a president, a vice-president, a secretary, and a treasurer. How many different committee configurations are possible if no student can serve more than one position?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the counting principle. There are 10 students to choose from for the president position. Once the president is chosen, there are 9 students left to choose from for the vice-president position. After the vice-president is chosen, there are 8 students left for the secretary position, and finally, 7 students left for the treasurer position.\n\nSo, the total number of different committee configurations is:\n\n10 (choices for president) × 9 (choices for vice-president) × 8 (choices for secretary) × 7 (choices for treasurer) = 5,040 different committee configurations."
