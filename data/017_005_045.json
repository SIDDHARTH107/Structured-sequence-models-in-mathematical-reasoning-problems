    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of G. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_3 â‰¡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. In this case, P has order 27, and G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_3 = 3. Let P be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since the order of P is 9, P is either a cyclic group of order 9 or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. In either case, P has an element of order 3, say x.\n\nLet N be the normalizer of P in G. Since P is a proper subgroup of N, we have |N| > 9. On the other hand, since P is a subgroup of N, we have |N| divides 27. Thus, |N| = 27, which means that N = G. Therefore, P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nLet Q be another Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, there exists an element g in G such that Q = gPg^{-1}. Now, let y = gxg^{-1}. Then, y is an element of Q, and y has order 3. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we have gPg^{-1} = P, which implies that y is also an element of P.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by x and y. Since x and y are both elements of P, H is a subgroup of P. Moreover, since x and y have order 3, the order of H divides 9. If the order of H is 9, then H = P. In this case, P has two elements of order 3, which implies that P is a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. If the order of H is 3, then H is a cyclic group of order 3 generated by either x or y.\n\nLet K be the subgroup of G generated by the elements of order 3. Since x and y are both elements of K, we have H is a subgroup of K. Moreover, since every element of P has order 1, 3, or 9, K is a subgroup of P. Thus, K = H, and K is a cyclic group of order 3.\n\nNow, let R be the subgroup of G generated by P and K. Since P is a normal subgroup of G and K is a cyclic group of order 3, R is isomorphic to the direct product of P and K. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group has an order of 27, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
