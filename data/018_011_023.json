    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B). Since A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}, there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, A ∩ B = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C, denoted as (A ∩ B) x C. Since A ∩ B = ∅, there are no elements in the first set to be paired with the elements in set C = {5, 6}. Therefore, the Cartesian product (A ∩ B) x C is also an empty set, which can be represented as ∅ or {}."
