Since there is no universal set provided, we can assume the universal set U to be the union of A and B:\n\nU = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we find the complements of A and B with respect to U:\n\nA' = U - A = {5, 6}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2}\n\nNow, we find the symmetric difference A' ∆ B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nFinally, we find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (A' ∆ B'):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (A' ∆ B') = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∆ {1, 2, 5, 6} = {}\n\nThe symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (A' ∆ B') is the empty set {}."
