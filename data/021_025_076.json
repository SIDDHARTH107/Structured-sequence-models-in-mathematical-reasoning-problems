    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B, with profits of $5 and $10 per unit, respectively. The production process for each product requires a certain amount of time and materials. To produce one unit of A, it takes 2 hours and 3 units of material. To produce one unit of B, it takes 4 hours and 1 unit of material. The company has 60 hours of labor and 40 units of materials available each week. The company wants to maximize its profits. Using the Whale Optimization Algorithm, what is the optimal production quantity of each product?",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. However, it is not possible to provide a step-by-step solution using WOA in this text format. Instead, we can solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit): P = 5x + 10y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 60\n2. Material constraint: 3x + y ≤ 40\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y = 60 => y = 15 - 0.5x\n2. 3x + y = 40 => y = 40 - 3x\n\nThe intersection points of these lines are (0, 15), (10, 0), and (12, 4).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each of these points:\n\n1. P(0, 15) = 5(0) + 10(15) = 150\n2. P(10, 0) = 5(10) + 10(0) = 50\n3. P(12, 4) = 5(12) + 10(4) = 104\n\nThe maximum profit is $150, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 15 units of product B."
