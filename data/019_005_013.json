    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to epistemic logic:\n\nSuppose there are three boxes on a table, one of which contains a prize. You are allowed to choose one box, but before you do, a friend who knows which box contains the prize tells you that one of the other boxes is empty. You now choose one of the remaining boxes. What is the probability that you have chosen the box with the prize?",
    "message_2": "This problem is known as the Monty Hall problem. Initially, the probability of choosing the box with the prize is 1/3, and the probability of not choosing the box with the prize is 2/3. When your friend tells you that one of the other boxes is empty, it doesn't change the initial probabilities.\n\nNow, you have two remaining boxes: the one you initially chose (with a 1/3 probability of containing the prize) and the other unopened box (with a 2/3 probability of containing the prize, since your friend would always reveal an empty box).\n\nSo, the probability that you have chosen the box with the prize is 1/3, and the probability that the other remaining box contains the prize is 2/3."
