    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(2 * 2x) + (2 * 3y) = 2 * (10 + 5i)\n4x + 6y = 20 + 10i\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 20 + 10i\n4x - 5y = 2 - 7i\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = (20 + 10i) - (2 - 7i)\n4x + 6y - 4x + 5y = 18 + 17i\n11y = 18 + 17i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 11 to find the value of y:\n\ny = (18 + 17i) / 11\ny = 18/11 + 17i/11\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 10 + 5i\n2x + 3(18/11 + 17i/11) = 10 + 5i\n\nMultiply both sides by 11 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n22x + 33(18 + 17i) = 110 + 55i\n\nNow distribute the 33:\n\n22x + 594 + 561i = 110 + 55i\n\nSubtract 594 from both sides:\n\n22x = -484 + 55i\n\nNow divide both sides by 22:\n\nx = (-484 + 55i) / 22\nx = -22 + 5i/2\n\nSo the values of x and y that satisfy the given system of linear equations are:\n\nx = -22 + 5i/2\ny = 18/11 + 17i/11"
