    "message_2": "To prove the existence of a set with exactly three elements using second-order logic, we can use the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) with the Axiom of Choice. We will use the following axioms:\n\n1. Axiom of Extensionality: ∀A ∀B ( (∀x (x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B)) → A = B )\n2. Axiom of Pairing: ∀a ∀b ∃C ∀x ( x ∈ C ↔ (x = a ∨ x = b) )\n3. Axiom of Union: ∀A ∃B ∀x ( x ∈ B ↔ ∃C (C ∈ A ∧ x ∈ C) )\n4. Axiom of Power Set: ∀A ∃P ∀x ( x ∈ P ↔ ∀y (y ∈ x → y ∈ A) )\n5. Axiom of Infinity: ∃I ( ∅ ∈ I ∧ ∀x (x ∈ I → x ∪ {x} ∈ I) )\n6. Axiom of Replacement: ∀A ( (∀x ∈ A ∃!y P(x, y)) → ∃B ∀x ∈ A ∃y ∈ B P(x, y) )\n7. Axiom of Regularity: ∀A (A ≠ ∅ → ∃x ∈ A (x ∩ A = ∅) )\n8. Axiom of Choice: ∀A ( (∀x ∈ A (x ≠ ∅)) → ∃C ∀x ∈ A ∃!y ∈ x (y ∈ C) )\n\nNow, let's prove the existence of a set with exactly three elements:\n\n1. By the Axiom of Infinity, there exists a set I such that ∅ ∈ I and ∀x (x ∈ I → x ∪ {x} ∈ I).\n2. Since ∅ ∈ I, by the property of I, we have ∅ ∪ {∅} ∈ I, which simplifies to {∅} ∈ I.\n3. Now, since {∅} ∈ I, we have {∅} ∪ {{∅}} ∈ I, which simplifies to {∅, {∅}} ∈ I.\n4. Finally, since {∅, {∅}} ∈ I, we have {∅, {∅}} ∪ {{∅, {∅}}} ∈ I, which simplifies to {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}} ∈ I.\n\nThus, we have shown that there exists a set with exactly three elements, namely {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}}."
