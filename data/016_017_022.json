    "message_2": "The total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial segment length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 10th iteration. So, n = 10.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^10) = 1 * 1024 = 1024 units\n\nThe total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 10th iteration is 1024 units."
