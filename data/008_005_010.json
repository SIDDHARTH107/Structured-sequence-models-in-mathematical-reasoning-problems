    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we will add the first equation to the third equation:\n\n(x + 2y - z) + (2x + 3y + z) = 7 + 13\n3x + 5y = 20 (1)\n\nNow, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n2(x + 2y - z) + (3x - y + 2z) = 2(7) + 5\n5x + 3y = 19 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n3x + 5y = 20 (1)\n5x + 3y = 19 (2)\n\nTo eliminate y, we will multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 5, and then subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(3x + 5y) * 3 - (5x + 3y) * 5 = 20 * 3 - 19 * 5\n9x + 15y - 25x - 15y = 60 - 95\n-16x = -35\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = -35 / -16\nx = 35/16\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of y. We will use equation (1):\n\n3x + 5y = 20\n3(35/16) + 5y = 20\n105/16 + 5y = 20\n\nNow, subtract 105/16 from both sides:\n\n5y = 20 - 105/16\n5y = (320 - 105) / 16\n5y = 215/16\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\ny = (215/16) / 5\ny = 215/80\ny = 43/16\n\nNow we have the values of x and y. We can substitute these values back into any of the original equations to find the value of z. We will use the first equation:\n\nx + 2y - z = 7\n35/16 + 2(43/16) - z = 7\n35/16 + 86/16 - z = 7\n121/16 - z = 7\n\nNow, subtract 121/16 from both sides:\n\n-z = 7 - 121/16\n-z = (112 - 121) / 16\n-z = -9/16\n\nNow, multiply by -1:\n\nz = 9/16\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 35/16\ny = 43/16\nz = 9/16"
