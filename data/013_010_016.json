    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, producing a homogenous product in a Cournot competition. The inverse demand function is given by P(Q) = 100 - Q, where Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. Their respective cost functions are C_A(Q_A) = 2Q_A and C_B(Q_B) = 5Q_B. \n\nWhat will be the profit-maximizing quantity of output for each firm and what will be the market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing quantity of output for each firm and the market price, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction functions for both firms.\n2. Solve the reaction functions simultaneously to find the Nash equilibrium.\n3. Calculate the market price using the inverse demand function.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction functions for both firms\n\nFirm A's profit function: π_A = P(Q) * Q_A - C_A(Q_A) = (100 - Q) * Q_A - 2Q_A\nFirm B's profit function: π_B = P(Q) * Q_B - C_B(Q_B) = (100 - Q) * Q_B - 5Q_B\n\nTo find the reaction function, we need to maximize the profit function with respect to each firm's output. We do this by taking the first-order derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n\nFirm A's reaction function:\nd(π_A) / dQ_A = (100 - Q) - Q_A - 2 = 0\nQ_A = 100 - Q - 2\n\nFirm B's reaction function:\nd(π_B) / dQ_B = (100 - Q) - Q_B - 5 = 0\nQ_B = 100 - Q - 5\n\nStep 2: Solve the reaction functions simultaneously to find the Nash equilibrium\n\nSince Q = Q_A + Q_B, we can substitute the reaction functions into the equation:\n\nQ = (100 - Q - 2) + (100 - Q - 5)\nQ = 193 - 2Q\n\nNow, solve for Q:\n3Q = 193\nQ = 193 / 3 ≈ 64.33\n\nNow, we can find the output for each firm:\n\nQ_A = 100 - Q - 2 ≈ 100 - 64.33 - 2 ≈ 33.67\nQ_B = 100 - Q - 5 ≈ 100 - 64.33 - 5 ≈ 30.67\n\nStep 3: Calculate the market price using the inverse demand function\n\nP(Q) = 100 - Q ≈ 100 - 64.33 ≈ 35.67\n\nSo, the profit-maximizing quantity of output for Firm A is approximately 33.67 units, for Firm B is approximately 30.67 units, and the market price is approximately $35.67."
