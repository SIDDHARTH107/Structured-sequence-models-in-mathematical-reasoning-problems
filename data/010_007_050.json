    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of X, we first need to understand the space X. Since we are identifying the points 1 and -1 in the unit circle S^1, we are essentially \"gluing\" these two points together. This results in a space that is topologically equivalent to the circle with a single point identified, which is also known as a \"pinched circle\" or \"cone.\"\n\nNow, let's find the fundamental group of X. We can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B, with path-connected intersection A ∩ B, then the fundamental group of X, denoted by π_1(X), can be computed as the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, with an amalgamation over their intersection, i.e., π_1(X) = π_1(A) * π_1(B) / N, where N is the normal subgroup generated by the elements of π_1(A ∩ B).\n\nLet A be an open disk centered at the identified point (1 = -1) in X, and let B be the complement of a small closed disk centered at the identified point in X. Then, A is contractible, so its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., π_1(A) = {1}. B is homotopy equivalent to the circle S^1, so its fundamental group is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., π_1(B) ≅ ℤ.\n\nSince A ∩ B is an open annulus, it is also homotopy equivalent to the circle S^1, so its fundamental group is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., π_1(A ∩ B) ≅ ℤ. The inclusion maps of A ∩ B into A and B induce homomorphisms i_A*: π_1(A ∩ B) → π_1(A) and i_B*: π_1(A ∩ B) → π_1(B). Since π_1(A) is trivial, i_A* is the trivial homomorphism, and since A ∩ B and B are homotopy equivalent, i_B* is an isomorphism.\n\nNow, by the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we have π_1(X) = π_1(A) * π_1(B) / N, where N is the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i_A*(g) * i_B*(g)^(-1) for g in π_1(A ∩ B). Since i_A*(g) = 1 for all g in π_1(A ∩ B), we have N = {1}, and thus π_1(X) = π_1(A) * π_1(B) / {1} ≅ ℤ.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., π_1(X) ≅ ℤ."
