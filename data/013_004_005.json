Alice wants to go to the concert while Bob wants to go to the movies. They both want to spend the evening together, so they agree to pick the same activity. \n\nHowever, they don't want to be disappointed if they choose the other person's preferred activity. They assign the following preferences:\n\n- Alice values going to the concert as 7 and going to the movies as 4.\n- Bob values going to the movies as 6 and going to the concert as 3.\n\nWhat is the best strategy for Alice and Bob to ensure they both end up going to the same activity and maximize their combined happiness?",
    "message_2": "To find the best strategy for Alice and Bob, we need to calculate the total happiness for each activity and compare them. \n\n1. If they go to the concert:\n   Alice's happiness: 7\n   Bob's happiness: 3\n   Total happiness: 7 + 3 = 10\n\n2. If they go to the movies:\n   Alice's happiness: 4\n   Bob's happiness: 6\n   Total happiness: 4 + 6 = 10\n\nIn this case, the total happiness for both activities is equal (10). Therefore, Alice and Bob can choose either activity, and their combined happiness will be maximized. They can decide based on other factors or flip a coin to make the decision."
