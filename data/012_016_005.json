    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the picture of the graph you are referring to. However, I can provide you with information on how to compute the Tutte polynomial for a given graph.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial, also known as the Tutte–Whitney polynomial, is a polynomial that encodes several important properties of a graph. It is defined as:\n\nT(x, y) = T_G(x, y) = Σ (x-1)^{r(G')-r(G)} (y-1)^{n(G')-n(G)+r(G')}\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all subgraphs G' of G, r(G) is the rank of G (the number of edges in a spanning forest of G), and n(G) is the number of vertices in G.\n\nTo compute the Tutte polynomial of a graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. Find all subgraphs of the given graph.\n2. For each subgraph, calculate the rank (r) and the number of vertices (n).\n3. Use the formula above to compute the Tutte polynomial.\n\nIf you can provide a description of the graph or its adjacency matrix, I can help you compute the Tutte polynomial for that specific graph."
