    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. They are:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_36\nThis group has a single generator and is generated by an element of order 36. It is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 36, i.e., Z_36.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 × C_4\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has two generators, one of order 9 and one of order 4, and the elements can be represented as pairs (a, b) where a is from C_9 and b is from C_4.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_3 × C_12\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 12. It has two generators, one of order 3 and one of order 12, and the elements can be represented as pairs (a, b) where a is from C_3 and b is from C_12.\n\n4. Semi-direct product of C_9 and C_4: C_9 ⋊ C_4\nThis group is a semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It is non-abelian and can be represented as a set of 2x2 matrices with entries from the field with 9 elements.\n\nThese are the four non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
