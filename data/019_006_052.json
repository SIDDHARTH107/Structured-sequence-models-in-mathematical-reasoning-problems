    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is not a subject in mathematics, it is a subfield of philosophical logic that deals with the logic of obligation, permission, prohibition, and related concepts. Therefore, it is not possible to formulate a precise numerical problem related to Deontic logic for a math student to solve. \n\nWould you like me to suggest a different topic or subtopic in mathematics to formulate a precise numerical problem for a student to solve?",
    "message_2": "Yes, please suggest a different topic or subtopic in mathematics for a numerical problem."
