    "message_2": "To find the Caesar shift, we need to compare the original message \"XY123\" with the encrypted message \"AB678\". We will focus on the letters since the numbers are not affected by the Caesar cipher.\n\nOriginal message: XY\nEncrypted message: AB\n\nNow, let's find the shift between X and A, and Y and B.\n\nX -> A: X is the 24th letter in the alphabet, and A is the 1st. To go from X to A, we need to shift 3 positions forward (24 + 3 = 27, and since there are only 26 letters, we wrap around and get 1).\n\nY -> B: Y is the 25th letter in the alphabet, and B is the 2nd. To go from Y to B, we need to shift 3 positions forward (25 + 3 = 28, and since there are only 26 letters, we wrap around and get 2).\n\nBoth shifts are the same, so the Caesar shift used in the encryption is 3."
