    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 24 and 36 is the smallest multiple that both numbers can divide into. To find the LCM, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 24: 2^3 * 3^1\nPrime factorization of 36: 2^2 * 3^2\n\nNow, we take the highest powers of each prime factor and multiply them together:\n\nLCM = 2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, the LCM of 24 and 36 is 72."
