    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the curve C at the point (1, 3), we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. The equation of the curve C is given by:\n\nF(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 7x - 10 = 0\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 7\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, 3):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 3) = -3(1)^2 - 7 = -10\n∂F/∂y(1, 3) = 2(3) = 6\n\nFinally, we form the Jacobian matrix J at the point (1, 3):\n\nJ(1, 3) = | ∂F/∂x(1, 3)  ∂F/∂y(1, 3) |\n          |      -10               6      |\n\nSo, the Jacobian of the curve C at the point (1, 3) is:\n\nJ(1, 3) = | -10  6 |"
