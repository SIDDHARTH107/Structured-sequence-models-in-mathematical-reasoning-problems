    "message_2": "Let a be an element of order 6 in G. Since the order of a is 6, we have a^6 = e (the identity element), and a^k ≠ e for any k < 6. \n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by a, denoted as H = ⟨a⟩. Since a has order 6, the subgroup H must have order 6 as well. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. Thus, the order of H (which is 6) divides the order of G (which is 12). \n\nNow, let's consider the cosets of H in G. Since the order of G is 12 and the order of H is 6, there are 12/6 = 2 distinct cosets of H in G. Let's denote these cosets as H and bH, where b is an element in G but not in H. \n\nNotice that the element b cannot have order 2 or 3, because if it did, then by the properties of cosets, bH would have 2 or 3 elements, which would contradict the fact that H and bH are distinct cosets that partition G. Therefore, b must have order 1, 4, 6, or 12. Since b is not in H, it cannot have order 1 or 6. If b has order 4, then b^2 has order 2, which is a contradiction as we have already established that b cannot have order 2. Thus, b must have order 12.\n\nNow, consider the cyclic subgroup generated by b, denoted as K = ⟨b⟩. Since b has order 12, K must have order 12 as well. But since G has order 12, this means that K = G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group generated by b, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12."
