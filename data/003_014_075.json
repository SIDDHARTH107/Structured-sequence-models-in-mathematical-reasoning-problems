A rider starts at the lowest point of the wheel and reaches the highest point after exactly 30 seconds. Using the sine function, what is the rider's height above the ground after 10 seconds on the ride?",
    "message_2": "To find the rider's height above the ground after 10 seconds, we can use the sine function. First, let's find the radius of the ferris wheel and the angular speed.\n\nThe diameter of the ferris wheel is 40 meters, so the radius (r) is half of that:\nr = 40/2 = 20 meters\n\nThe ferris wheel makes a full rotation (360 degrees) every 60 seconds. To find the angular speed (ω) in degrees per second, we can divide 360 by 60:\nω = 360/60 = 6 degrees per second\n\nNow, we can find the angle (θ) the rider has traveled after 10 seconds:\nθ = ω * time = 6 * 10 = 60 degrees\n\nWe can now use the sine function to find the vertical distance (y) the rider has traveled above the starting point:\ny = r * sin(θ) = 20 * sin(60)\n\nSince we're working with degrees, we need to convert 60 degrees to radians:\n60 degrees * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow we can find y:\ny = 20 * sin(π/3) ≈ 20 * 0.866 = 17.32 meters\n\nFinally, we need to add the radius of the ferris wheel to the vertical distance to find the rider's height above the ground:\nheight = r + y = 20 + 17.32 ≈ 37.32 meters\n\nSo, the rider's height above the ground after 10 seconds on the ride is approximately 37.32 meters."
