    "message_2": "To determine the domain of convergence, we will use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as $n$ approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. In other words, we want to find:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right|\n$$\n\nFor our given power series, we have:\n\n$$\na_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}(z-1)^n\n$$\n\nSo, we can find the ratio of consecutive terms:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n+1}(z-1)^{n+1}}{\\frac{(-1)^n}{n}(z-1)^n}\n$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{-1}{\\frac{n+1}{n}}(z-1)\n$$\n\nNow, we take the limit as $n$ approaches infinity:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{-1}{\\frac{n+1}{n}}(z-1)\\right| = |z-1|\n$$\n\nFor the series to converge, we need this limit to be less than 1:\n\n$$\n|z-1| < 1\n$$\n\nThis inequality represents the domain of convergence, which is the open interval $(0, 2)$.\n\nNow, we want to find the sum of the series for values of $z$ within its domain of convergence. Notice that the given power series is an alternating series, and its general term can be written as:\n\n$$\na_n = (-1)^n \\frac{(z-1)^n}{n}\n$$\n\nThe series converges by the Alternating Series Test, as the limit of the absolute value of the general term goes to zero as $n$ approaches infinity, and the sequence of absolute values is decreasing.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the series as:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}(z-1)^n = \\ln(1 + (z-1)) = \\ln(z)\n$$\n\nThis is because the given power series is the Taylor series expansion of the natural logarithm function, $\\ln(1+x)$, centered at $x=0$. Since the domain of convergence is $(0, 2)$, we can replace $x$ with $(z-1)$:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}(z-1)^n = \\ln(z)\n$$\n\nSo, the sum of the series for values of $z$ within its domain of convergence $(0, 2)$ is given by the natural logarithm function, $\\ln(z)$."
