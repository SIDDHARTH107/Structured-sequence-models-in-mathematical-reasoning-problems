    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Here, we want to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = cos(x) + 2sin(2x) within the range [0, 2π].\n\nTo apply PSO, we need to define some parameters:\n\n1. Number of particles (n): The number of candidate solutions in the swarm.\n2. Number of iterations (T): The number of times the swarm will be updated.\n3. Inertia weight (w): A factor that controls the balance between exploration and exploitation.\n4. Cognitive and social coefficients (c1 and c2): Factors that control the influence of the particle's best position and the swarm's best position.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of PSO in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return np.cos(x) + 2 * np.sin(2 * x)\n\ndef pso(n, T, w, c1, c2):\n    # Initialize particles\n    particles = 2 * np.pi * np.random.rand(n)\n    velocities = np.zeros(n)\n    personal_best = particles.copy()\n    global_best = particles[np.argmax(f(particles))]\n\n    for t in range(T):\n        # Update velocities and positions\n        r1, r2 = np.random.rand(n), np.random.rand(n)\n        velocities = w * velocities + c1 * r1 * (personal_best - particles) + c2 * r2 * (global_best - particles)\n        particles += velocities\n\n        # Update personal best\n        better_mask = f(particles) > f(personal_best)\n        personal_best[better_mask] = particles[better_mask]\n\n        # Update global best\n        current_global_best = particles[np.argmax(f(particles))]\n        if f(current_global_best) > f(global_best):\n            global_best = current_global_best\n\n    return global_best, f(global_best)\n\n# Parameters\nn = 100\nT = 1000\nw = 0.7\nc1 = 1.5\nc2 = 1.5\n\n# Run PSO\nx_max, f_max = pso(n, T, w, c1, c2)\nprint(\"Maximum value of f(x) =\", f_max, \"at x =\", x_max)\n```\n\nThis code initializes a swarm of 100 particles and iterates 1000 times. The inertia weight is set to 0.7, and the cognitive and social coefficients are set to 1.5. The output will be the maximum value of the function f(x) and the corresponding x value.\n\nNote that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the PSO algorithm. You can increase the number of particles or iterations to improve the accuracy of the result."
