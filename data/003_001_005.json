    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 cm and one leg of length 6 cm. Find the length of the other leg using the Pythagorean theorem.",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse has a length of 10 cm and one leg has a length of 6 cm. Let's call the length of the other leg x.\n\nThe theorem can be written as:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\n6^2 + x^2 = 10^2\n\nSolving for x:\n\n36 + x^2 = 100\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides:\n\nx^2 = 64\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nx = âˆš64\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
