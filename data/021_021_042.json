    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company produces two types of products X and Y. Each unit of product X requires 4 hours of processing time on machine A and 2 hours of processing time on machine B, while each unit of product Y requires 2 hours of processing time on machine A and 5 hours of processing time on machine B. The company has 12 hours of processing time available on machine A and 25 hours of processing time available on machine B to produce the products. If the profit of each unit of product X is $30 and the profit of each unit of product Y is $40, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit using cuckoo search algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the breeding behavior of cuckoo birds. It is used to solve optimization problems, such as the one described in the problem statement. To apply the Cuckoo Search Algorithm to this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: In this case, the objective function is the total profit, which is given by P = 30X + 40Y, where X and Y are the number of units of product X and product Y, respectively.\n\n2. Define the constraints: The constraints are the available processing time on machines A and B:\n   - 4X + 2Y ≤ 12 (Machine A)\n   - 2X + 5Y ≤ 25 (Machine B)\n   - X, Y ≥ 0 (Non-negative production)\n\n3. Initialize a population of \"nests\" (potential solutions) with random values of X and Y that satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) using the objective function.\n\n5. Perform the following steps for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met:\n   a. Select a nest (solution) randomly and generate a new solution by modifying the selected nest using a \"Levy flight\" (a random walk with a specific probability distribution).\n   b. If the new solution is better (higher profit) and satisfies the constraints, replace the selected nest with the new solution.\n   c. Randomly choose a fraction of the worst nests and replace them with new nests generated by Levy flights.\n   d. Evaluate the fitness of the new nests and update the best solution found so far.\n\n6. The best solution found during the iterations will be the optimal number of units of product X and product Y to maximize profit.\n\nIt's important to note that the Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a heuristic method, and it may not always find the exact optimal solution. However, it can provide a good approximation in a reasonable amount of time. To obtain the exact optimal solution, you may need to use other optimization methods, such as linear programming."
