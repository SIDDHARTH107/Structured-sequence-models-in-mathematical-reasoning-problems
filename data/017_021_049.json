    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 48 with exactly 47 elements of order 2. We will show that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C48.\n\nFirst, note that the order of G is 48 = 2^4 * 3. By Sylow's Theorem, we know that there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 2^4 = 16 and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3 in G. \n\nSince there are 47 elements of order 2 in G, there is only one element of order 1, which is the identity element e. This means that all non-identity elements in P must have order 2. P is a group of order 16, and the only group of order 16 with all non-identity elements having order 2 is the elementary abelian group (also known as a vector space over the field with 2 elements) of order 16, which we will denote as V_4(2). So, P is isomorphic to V_4(2).\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since the index of Q in G is 16, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, Q must be normal in G by the Normalizer-Centralizer Theorem. Thus, we have a normal subgroup Q of order 3 in G.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal subgroups of G, their intersection P ∩ Q must also be normal in G. However, P and Q have trivial intersection, as their orders are coprime (gcd(16, 3) = 1). Thus, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, we have a normal subgroup Q of order 3 and a subgroup P of order 16 with trivial intersection. By the Product Formula, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 16 * 3 / 1 = 48. Since |PQ| = |G|, we have that PQ = G.\n\nNow, we have G = PQ with P and Q having trivial intersection and Q being normal in G. By the Internal Direct Product Theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q.\n\nSince P is isomorphic to V_4(2) and Q is a cyclic group of order 3 (as there is only one group of order 3, which is cyclic), we have G ≅ V_4(2) × C3. However, the direct product of an elementary abelian group of order 2^n and a cyclic group of order p, where p is an odd prime, is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2^n * p (see, for example, Theorem 5.5.3 in \"A Course in the Theory of Groups\" by Derek J.S. Robinson). Therefore, G ≅ C48.\n\nSo, we have shown that the group G with exactly 47 elements of order 2 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C48."
