The bidders' valuations for the painting are $400, $600, and $800. What is the expected revenue for the auctioneer?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price. In this case, we have three bidders with valuations of $400, $600, and $800.\n\nSince the bidders are expected to bid their true valuations, the possible outcomes are:\n\n1. Bidder 1 wins with a bid of $400, but this is not possible because there are higher bids from the other bidders.\n2. Bidder 2 wins with a bid of $600, and pays the second-highest bid, which is $400 from Bidder 1.\n3. Bidder 3 wins with a bid of $800, and pays the second-highest bid, which is $600 from Bidder 2.\n\nIn this case, the only possible outcomes are that Bidder 2 wins and pays $400 or Bidder 3 wins and pays $600. Since there are no probabilities given for each bidder winning, we can assume that each outcome is equally likely. Therefore, the expected revenue for the auctioneer is the average of the two possible revenues:\n\nExpected revenue = (Revenue from Outcome 2 + Revenue from Outcome 3) / 2\nExpected revenue = ($400 + $600) / 2\nExpected revenue = $1000 / 2\nExpected revenue = $500\n\nSo, the expected revenue for the auctioneer is $500."
