Assume that X has no singularities at infinity (i.e., the hyperplane at infinity intersects X transversely in exactly d points). Write down formulas for the degree and the genus of the image of X under a projection from a general point of a hyperplane not containing X.\n\nQuestion: Let X be a non-singular algebraic curve of genus g defined by a degree 4 polynomial equation in projective 3-space. Assume that X has no singularities at infinity and is projected from a general point of a hyperplane not containing X. Find the degree and the genus of the image of the curve X under the projection.",
    "message_2": "For a non-singular algebraic curve X of degree d in projective n-space, when projected from a general point of a hyperplane not containing X, the degree and genus of the image can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\nDegree: d' = d - 1\nGenus: g' = (d' - 1)(d' - 2)/2\n\nIn this case, X is a non-singular algebraic curve of genus g defined by a degree 4 polynomial equation in projective 3-space. So, d = 4.\n\nNow, we can calculate the degree and genus of the image of the curve X under the projection:\n\nDegree: d' = d - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\nGenus: g' = (d' - 1)(d' - 2)/2 = (3 - 1)(3 - 2)/2 = (2)(1)/2 = 1\n\nSo, the degree of the image of the curve X under the projection is 3, and the genus is 1."
