    "message_1": "Let X be a manifold of dimension 3, and let A and B be disjoint submanifolds of X, also of dimension 3. Suppose that A and B intersect another submanifold C of X transversally, with intersections of A ∩ C and B ∩ C in C consisting of simple closed curves of degrees m and n, respectively. Find the degree of the intersection of A and B in X.",
    "message_2": "Since A and B are disjoint submanifolds of X, their intersection in X is empty, i.e., A ∩ B = ∅. Therefore, the degree of the intersection of A and B in X is 0."
