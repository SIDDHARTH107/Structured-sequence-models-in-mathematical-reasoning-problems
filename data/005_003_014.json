    "message_1": "Suppose you have collected data on the number of hours a group of students studied and their corresponding test scores, and you want to use simple linear regression to model the relationship between these two variables. If the regression equation you obtained is:\n\nTest score = 60 + 3(hours studied)\n\nWhat is the predicted test score for a student who studied for 5 hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted test score for a student who studied for 5 hours, plug the value of 5 into the equation for the hours studied:\n\nTest score = 60 + 3(hours studied)\nTest score = 60 + 3(5)\nTest score = 60 + 15\nTest score = 75\n\nThe predicted test score for a student who studied for 5 hours is 75."
