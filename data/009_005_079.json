Solve the differential equation for the current in the circuit if the voltage across the circuit is given by V(t) = 10cos(2t). Find the amplitude and phase angle of the current in the circuit.",
    "message_2": "For an RLC circuit, the differential equation relating the voltage V(t), current I(t), resistance R, inductance L, and capacitance C is given by:\n\nL * (d^2I/dt^2) + R * (dI/dt) + (1/C) * I = V(t)\n\nGiven the values of L, C, R, and V(t), we can plug them into the equation:\n\n5 * (d^2I/dt^2) + 15 * (dI/dt) + (1/0.1) * I = 10cos(2t)\n\nNow, we can solve this differential equation for I(t). Since the voltage source is sinusoidal, we can assume a solution of the form:\n\nI(t) = A * cos(2t + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude and φ is the phase angle. Differentiating I(t) with respect to t:\n\ndI/dt = -2A * sin(2t + φ)\nd^2I/dt^2 = -4A * cos(2t + φ)\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the differential equation:\n\n5 * (-4A * cos(2t + φ)) + 15 * (-2A * sin(2t + φ)) + 10 * I = 10cos(2t)\n\nNow, equating the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms:\n\n-20A * cos(2t + φ) + 10 * A * cos(2t + φ) = 10cos(2t)\n-30A * sin(2t + φ) = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two possibilities: either A = 0 or sin(2t + φ) = 0. Since A = 0 would mean no current in the circuit, we can discard that possibility. So, we have:\n\nsin(2t + φ) = 0\n\nThis implies that:\n\n2t + φ = nπ, where n is an integer\n\nSince we are interested in the phase angle φ, we can write:\n\nφ = nπ - 2t\n\nNow, from the first equation:\n\n-20A * cos(2t + φ) + 10 * A * cos(2t + φ) = 10cos(2t)\n-10A * cos(2t + φ) = 10cos(2t)\n\nDividing both sides by 10cos(2t):\n\nA * cos(2t + φ) = 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the expression for φ:\n\nA * cos(2t + nπ - 2t) = 1\nA * cos(nπ) = 1\n\nFor n = 0, we have:\n\nA * cos(0) = 1\nA = 1\n\nSo, the current in the circuit is given by:\n\nI(t) = cos(2t)\n\nThe amplitude of the current is A = 1, and the phase angle is φ = 0."
