    "message_2": "To determine the number of simple closed curves on a closed orientable surface of genus 2 up to isotopy, we can use the classification of surfaces and the concept of Dehn twists.\n\nA closed orientable surface of genus 2, denoted as Σ₂, is a connected sum of two tori (T²). We can represent Σ₂ by cutting two tori along simple closed curves and gluing them together along their boundaries. \n\nNow, let's consider the simple closed curves on Σ₂ up to isotopy. We can classify these curves into three types:\n\n1. Curves that are non-separating: These curves do not divide the surface into two disconnected components. For a genus 2 surface, there are 5 non-separating simple closed curves up to isotopy. These can be represented by the standard curves a, b, c, d, and e, where a and b are on one torus, c and d are on the other torus, and e connects the two tori.\n\n2. Curves that are separating and reduce the genus: These curves divide the surface into two disconnected components, one of which has a lower genus. For a genus 2 surface, there is only 1 such curve up to isotopy, which separates the surface into two tori.\n\n3. Curves that are separating and preserve the genus: These curves divide the surface into two disconnected components, both of which have the same genus as the original surface. For a genus 2 surface, there are 2 such curves up to isotopy. These can be represented by the curves f and g, where f separates the surface into two connected sums of a torus and a disk, and g separates the surface into two connected sums of a torus and a Möbius strip.\n\nIn total, there are 5 (non-separating) + 1 (separating, reducing genus) + 2 (separating, preserving genus) = 8 simple closed curves on a closed orientable surface of genus 2 up to isotopy."
