    "message_2": "Liouville's theorem states that if a function is entire (holomorphic on the entire complex plane) and bounded, then it must be constant.\n\nThe function $f(z) = 2z^3 - 4z^2 - 3z + 5$ is a polynomial, and all polynomials are entire functions. However, we need to check if this function is bounded.\n\nAs $z$ goes to infinity, the dominant term of the polynomial is $2z^3$. The other terms become negligible compared to $2z^3$ as $z$ grows larger. Therefore, the function $f(z)$ is not bounded, since the magnitude of $f(z)$ will also go to infinity as $z$ goes to infinity.\n\nSince the function is not bounded, Liouville's theorem does not apply, and we cannot conclude that the function is constant. In fact, we can clearly see that it is not constant."
