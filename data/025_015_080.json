    "message_2": "In the projective space over the field of complex numbers, a cubic surface is a surface defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3. The degree of the surface is the degree of the polynomial that defines it. In this case, the degree of the surfaces in the family of cubic surfaces is 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the given line represented by the equations $x=0$, $y=0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The line can be parametrized as $[0:0:z:w]$, where $z$ and $w$ are homogeneous coordinates.\n\nA cubic surface that intersects this line in exactly 4 points will have the form $f(x,y,z,w) = 0$. Since the line is defined by $x=0$ and $y=0$, we can substitute these values into the equation of the cubic surface:\n\n$f(0,0,z,w) = 0$\n\nThe polynomial $f(0,0,z,w)$ must have degree 3 in $z$ and $w$ and have exactly 4 distinct roots in the projective space over the field of complex numbers. This means that the polynomial can be factored as:\n\n$f(0,0,z,w) = c(zw - a^3)(z^2w - a^2b^2)(z^3 - a^3b^3)$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are complex constants.\n\nNow, we can expand this polynomial and obtain the general form of the cubic surface that intersects the given line in exactly 4 points:\n\n$f(x,y,z,w) = c(x^3 + x^2y + xy^2 + y^3) + (zw - a^3)(z^2w - a^2b^2)(z^3 - a^3b^3)$\n\nThe degree of this cubic surface is 3, as the highest degree terms are of degree 3. Therefore, the degrees of the surfaces in the family of cubic surfaces that intersect the given line in exactly 4 points are 3."
