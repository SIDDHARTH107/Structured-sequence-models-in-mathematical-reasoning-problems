    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will first determine the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G using Sylow's Theorems.\n\nRecall the Sylow Theorems:\n1. For any prime p dividing the order of a group G, there exists at least one Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted n_p, divides the order of G and satisfies n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nSince the order of G is 12, we have the prime factorization 12 = 2^2 * 3^1. Thus, we will consider Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2). By Sylow's Third Theorem, n_2 must divide 12 and satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. \n\nNext, let's find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3). By Sylow's Third Theorem, n_3 must divide 12 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the values of n_2 and n_3.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are unique, they are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. The Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal, but they are all conjugate to each other. Since the order of Q is 3, it is isomorphic to C3. The group G acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup, which has order 4. Thus, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. The Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal, but they are all conjugate to each other. Since the order of P is 4, it is isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2. If G is isomorphic to C4, then G would be isomorphic to C12, which we have already considered. If G is isomorphic to C2 × C2, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
