    "message_1": "A map of a certain city is drawn on a square paper. The left bottom corner of the map has coordinate (0,0) and the right top corner of the map has coordinate (1,1). A complex function z -> w is defined by the transformation w = f(z) = (z - 1)/(z + 1). Find the image of the following points of the city under the conformal map:\n\n- The point with coordinates (0.5, 0.5)\n- The point with coordinates (0.1, 0.9)\n- The point with coordinates (0.8, 0.2)",
    "message_2": "To find the image of the points under the conformal map, we need to apply the transformation w = f(z) = (z - 1)/(z + 1) to each point. We can represent the points as complex numbers, where the x-coordinate is the real part and the y-coordinate is the imaginary part.\n\n1. The point with coordinates (0.5, 0.5)\nLet z = 0.5 + 0.5i. Then,\nw = f(z) = (z - 1)/(z + 1) = ((0.5 + 0.5i) - 1)/((0.5 + 0.5i) + 1)\nw = (-0.5 + 0.5i)/(1.5 + 0.5i)\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to simplify the expression:\nw = (-0.5 + 0.5i)(1.5 - 0.5i)/((1.5 + 0.5i)(1.5 - 0.5i))\nw = (-0.25 - 0.25i)/(2.25 + 0.25)\nw = (-0.25 - 0.25i)/2.5\nw = -0.1 - 0.1i\n\nSo, the image of the point (0.5, 0.5) is (-0.1, -0.1).\n\n2. The point with coordinates (0.1, 0.9)\nLet z = 0.1 + 0.9i. Then,\nw = f(z) = (z - 1)/(z + 1) = ((0.1 + 0.9i) - 1)/((0.1 + 0.9i) + 1)\nw = (-0.9 + 0.9i)/(1.1 + 0.9i)\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to simplify the expression:\nw = (-0.9 + 0.9i)(1.1 - 0.9i)/((1.1 + 0.9i)(1.1 - 0.9i))\nw = (0.18 + 1.62i)/(1.21 + 0.81)\nw = (0.18 + 1.62i)/2.02\nw = 0.08910891 + 0.8019802i\n\nSo, the image of the point (0.1, 0.9) is approximately (0.0891, 0.8020).\n\n3. The point with coordinates (0.8, 0.2)\nLet z = 0.8 + 0.2i. Then,\nw = f(z) = (z - 1)/(z + 1) = ((0.8 + 0.2i) - 1)/((0.8 + 0.2i) + 1)\nw = (-0.2 + 0.2i)/(1.8 + 0.2i)\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to simplify the expression:\nw = (-0.2 + 0.2i)(1.8 - 0.2i)/((1.8 + 0.2i)(1.8 - 0.2i))\nw = (-0.36 - 0.04i)/(3.24 + 0.04)\nw = (-0.36 - 0.04i)/3.28\nw = -0.1097561 - 0.01219512i\n\nSo, the image of the point (0.8, 0.2) is approximately (-0.1098, -0.0122).\n\nIn summary, the images of the points under the conformal map are:\n- (0.5, 0.5) -> (-0.1, -0.1)\n- (0.1, 0.9) -> (0.0891, 0.8020)\n- (0.8, 0.2) -> (-0.1098, -0.0122)"
