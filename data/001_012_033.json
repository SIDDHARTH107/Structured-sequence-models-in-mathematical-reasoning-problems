    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n$21x^2 - 14x = 7x(3x - 2)$\n\nDenominator:\n$28x^3 + 35x^2 = 7x^2(4x + 5)$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the rational expression as:\n\n$\\frac{7x(3x - 2)}{7x^2(4x + 5)}$\n\nWe can now cancel out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n$\\frac{7x(3x - 2)}{7x^2(4x + 5)} = \\frac{\\cancel{7x}(3x - 2)}{\\cancel{7x}x(4x + 5)} = \\frac{3x - 2}{x(4x + 5)}$\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n$\\frac{3x - 2}{x(4x + 5)}$"
