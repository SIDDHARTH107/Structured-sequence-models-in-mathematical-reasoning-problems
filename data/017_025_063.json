    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 mod p and divides n.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. So, we need to find the Sylow subgroups of orders 2^3, 3, and 5.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups. Then, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and we have only one group up to isomorphism, which is C_8 × C_3 × C_5 ≅ C_120.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 4: In this case, the group is a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups. Since there is only one nontrivial automorphism of C_5, we have only one group up to isomorphism, which is C_8 × (C_3 ⋊ C_5).\n\n3. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1: In this case, the group is a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups. Since there are two nontrivial automorphisms of C_3, we have two groups up to isomorphism, which are C_8 × (C_3 ⋊ C_5) and C_8 × (C_3 ⋊ C_5^2).\n\n4. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 4: In this case, the group is a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups. Since there are two nontrivial automorphisms of C_3 and one nontrivial automorphism of C_5, we have two groups up to isomorphism, which are (C_3 ⋊ C_5) ⋊ C_8 and (C_3 ⋊ C_5^2) ⋊ C_8.\n\n5. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: In this case, the group is a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups. Since there are four nontrivial automorphisms of C_8, we have four groups up to isomorphism, which are C_3 × (C_8 ⋊ C_5), C_3 × (C_8 ⋊ C_5^2), C_3 × (C_8 ⋊ C_5^3), and C_3 × (C_8 ⋊ C_5^4).\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 120. The groups can be classified according to their isomorphism type as follows:\n\n1. C_120\n2. C_8 × (C_3 ⋊ C_5)\n3. C_8 × (C_3 ⋊ C_5^2)\n4. (C_3 ⋊ C_5) ⋊ C_8\n5. (C_3 ⋊ C_5^2) ⋊ C_8\n6. C_3 × (C_8 ⋊ C_5)\n7. C_3 × (C_8 ⋊ C_5^2)\n8. C_3 × (C_8 ⋊ C_5^3)\n9. C_3 × (C_8 ⋊ C_5^4)\n10. C_8 × (C_3 ⋊ C_5)"
