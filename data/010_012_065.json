The smoothness of these maps allows us to define smooth functions $f_i: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f_i \\circ \\varphi_i^{-1}$ is a smooth function on each coordinate patch $U_i$. \n\nSuppose that $f: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function. Show that $f$ is smooth if and only if for each $i$, the function $f_i \\circ f$ is smooth on $U_i$.",
    "message_2": "We are given that $f: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function. We need to show that $f$ is smooth if and only if for each $i$, the function $f_i \\circ f$ is smooth on $U_i$.\n\nFirst, we will show that if $f$ is smooth, then $f_i \\circ f$ is smooth on $U_i$ for each $i$. Since $f$ is smooth, it is smooth on each coordinate patch $U_i$. Now, consider the function $f_i \\circ f$. We have that\n\n$$f_i \\circ f = f_i \\circ (\\varphi_i^{-1} \\circ \\varphi_i) \\circ f = (f_i \\circ \\varphi_i^{-1}) \\circ (\\varphi_i \\circ f).$$\n\nSince $f$ is smooth on $U_i$, $\\varphi_i \\circ f$ is smooth on $U_i$. Moreover, $f_i \\circ \\varphi_i^{-1}$ is smooth by definition. Thus, the composition $(f_i \\circ \\varphi_i^{-1}) \\circ (\\varphi_i \\circ f)$ is smooth on $U_i$, which means that $f_i \\circ f$ is smooth on $U_i$ for each $i$.\n\nNow, we will show that if $f_i \\circ f$ is smooth on $U_i$ for each $i$, then $f$ is smooth. Let $p \\in M$. Since the atlas $\\{(U_i,\\varphi_i)\\}$ covers $M$, there exists an index $j$ such that $p \\in U_j$. We have that\n\n$$f = (\\varphi_j \\circ \\varphi_j^{-1}) \\circ f = (\\varphi_j \\circ (\\varphi_j^{-1} \\circ f_j^{-1})) \\circ (f_j \\circ f).$$\n\nSince $f_j \\circ f$ is smooth on $U_j$, it follows that $\\varphi_j^{-1} \\circ f_j^{-1}$ is smooth on the image of $U_j$ under $\\varphi_j$. Moreover, $\\varphi_j$ is a smooth map, so the composition $\\varphi_j \\circ (\\varphi_j^{-1} \\circ f_j^{-1})$ is smooth on $U_j$. Thus, the composition $(\\varphi_j \\circ (\\varphi_j^{-1} \\circ f_j^{-1})) \\circ (f_j \\circ f)$ is smooth on $U_j$, which means that $f$ is smooth on $U_j$. Since $p \\in U_j$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $f$ is smooth on $M$.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that $f$ is smooth if and only if for each $i$, the function $f_i \\circ f$ is smooth on $U_i$."
