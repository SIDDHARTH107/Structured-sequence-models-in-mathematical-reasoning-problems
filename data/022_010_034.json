    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = (5z^2)/(z-2) at z=0, we first perform a partial fraction decomposition. We can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = 5z^2 * (1/(z-2))\n\nNow, we want to rewrite the term (1/(z-2)) as a geometric series. To do this, we can factor out a -2 from the denominator:\n\n1/(z-2) = 1/(-2(1 - z/2))\n\nNow, we can rewrite the term (1/(1 - z/2)) as a geometric series:\n\n1/(1 - z/2) = 1 + (z/2) + (z/2)^2 + (z/2)^3 + ...\n\nNow, we multiply this geometric series by 5z^2 and -1/2:\n\nf(z) = 5z^2 * (-1/2) * (1 + (z/2) + (z/2)^2 + (z/2)^3 + ...)\n\nf(z) = -5z^2/2 - 5z^3/4 - 5z^4/8 - 5z^5/16 - ...\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) at z=0.\n\nTo determine the radius of convergence, we can use the geometric series convergence criterion. The geometric series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1:\n\n|z/2| < 1\n\n|z| < 2\n\nThe radius of convergence is 2."
