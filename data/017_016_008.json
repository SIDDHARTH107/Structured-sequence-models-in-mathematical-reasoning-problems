    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27, and let Z(G) be the center of G. We are given that Z(G) is trivial, i.e., Z(G) = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. We will show that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nSince the order of G is 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of G. The order of P is 3^3 = 27. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides the order of G, so the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is either 1 or 4. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal in G, and since its order is equal to the order of G, it must be G itself. In this case, G is a p-group, and it is a well-known fact that the center of a p-group is nontrivial, which contradicts our assumption that Z(G) is trivial. Therefore, there must be 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nLet P be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is of order 27, P is also a p-group, and as mentioned earlier, the center of a p-group is nontrivial. Let Z(P) be the center of P, then |Z(P)| > 1. Since Z(P) is a subgroup of P, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of Z(P) must divide the order of P, which is 27. The only divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. We already know that |Z(P)| > 1, so the possible orders for Z(P) are 3, 9, and 27. If |Z(P)| = 27, then Z(P) = P, which implies that P is abelian and thus G is abelian, contradicting the assumption that Z(G) is trivial. Therefore, |Z(P)| must be either 3 or 9.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of its Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_4, where S_4 is the symmetric group on 4 elements. The kernel of φ, denoted by Ker(φ), is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in all Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is a Sylow 3-subgroup, Ker(φ) is contained in P. Moreover, Ker(φ) is contained in Z(P), because if x ∈ Ker(φ), then for any y ∈ P, we have yxy^(-1) = x, which implies that x commutes with all elements of P. Thus, Ker(φ) is a subgroup of Z(P), and by Lagrange's theorem, the order of Ker(φ) must divide the order of Z(P), which is either 3 or 9. If |Ker(φ)| = 9, then the index of Ker(φ) in G is 3, and by the normalizer-centralizer theorem, this would imply that G has a normal subgroup of order 9, which contradicts the assumption that Z(G) is trivial. Therefore, |Ker(φ)| must be 3.\n\nSince Ker(φ) is a normal subgroup of G with order 3, it follows that G/Ker(φ) is a group of order 9. Moreover, G/Ker(φ) is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_4, which has order 24. The only groups of order 9 are the cyclic group C_9 and the direct product C_3 × C_3. Since G is non-abelian, G/Ker(φ) must be isomorphic to C_3 × C_3. Thus, we have an exact sequence:\n\n1 → Ker(φ) → G → C_3 × C_3 → 1\n\nThis implies that G is an extension of C_3 × C_3 by the cyclic group C_3. It is a well-known fact that there is only one non-abelian group of order 27, which is the semidirect product of C_9 and C_3, denoted by C_9 ⋊ C_3. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to this non-abelian group of order 27."
