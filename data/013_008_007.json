    "message_1": "Suppose there are 4 players in a Public Goods Game. Each player has 10 points to contribute to a public pot which is then multiplied by a factor of 1.6 and evenly distributed among all players. However, if any player chooses not to contribute, they receive 2 points directly from the pot but do not contribute to the multiplication factor. What is the overall payoff for each player if they all choose to contribute? What if one player chooses not to contribute?",
    "message_2": "If all players choose to contribute, the total contribution to the public pot is 4 * 10 = 40 points. The pot is then multiplied by the factor of 1.6, resulting in 40 * 1.6 = 64 points. These 64 points are then evenly distributed among all 4 players, so each player receives 64 / 4 = 16 points.\n\nIf one player chooses not to contribute, the total contribution to the public pot is 3 * 10 = 30 points. The pot is then multiplied by the factor of 1.6, resulting in 30 * 1.6 = 48 points. The player who did not contribute takes 2 points directly from the pot, leaving 48 - 2 = 46 points. These 46 points are then evenly distributed among all 4 players, so each of the 3 contributing players receives 46 / 4 = 11.5 points. The non-contributing player receives 11.5 points from the pot plus the 2 points they took directly, for a total of 11.5 + 2 = 13.5 points."
