    "message_2": "A cyclic group of prime order 17 is a group with 17 elements, where each element can be generated by repeatedly applying the group operation to a single generator element. In this case, the cyclic group is denoted by Z_17 or C_17.\n\nThe elements of this group are represented by the integers 0, 1, 2, ..., 16, and the group operation is addition modulo 17. The generator element can be any integer from 1 to 16 that is relatively prime to 17 (i.e., has no common factors with 17 other than 1). In this case, since 17 is a prime number, all integers from 1 to 16 can serve as generators."
