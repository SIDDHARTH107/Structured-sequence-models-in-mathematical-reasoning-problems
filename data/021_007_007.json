    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the root of the nonlinear equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1 using the Newton-Raphson method. Starting with an initial guess of x0 = 1, find the next estimate x1 accurate to 4 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton-Raphson formula to find the next estimate x1:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe are given that the initial guess x0 = 1. So, we need to find f(x0) and f'(x0):\n\nf(1) = 1^3 - 2(1)^2 + 1 - 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 - 1 = -1\nf'(1) = 3(1)^2 - 4(1) + 1 = 3 - 4 + 1 = 0\n\nHowever, we have a problem here. The derivative f'(1) = 0, which means we cannot use the Newton-Raphson formula since it would involve dividing by zero. In this case, the student should try a different initial guess or use another method to find the root of the equation."
