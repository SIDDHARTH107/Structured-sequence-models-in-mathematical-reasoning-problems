    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nSo, for f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will differentiate each term with respect to x:\n\nThe derivative of 3x^2 with respect to x:\nd(3x^2)/dx = 3 * 2 * x^(2-1) = 6x\n\nThe derivative of -5x with respect to x:\nd(-5x)/dx = -5 * 1 * x^(1-1) = -5\n\nThe derivative of the constant term 2 with respect to x:\nd(2)/dx = 0 (since the derivative of a constant is always 0)\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 5\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 at x = 2 is 7."
