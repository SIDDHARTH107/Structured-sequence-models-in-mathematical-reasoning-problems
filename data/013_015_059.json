    "message_1": "Consider an owner of a company who hires a manager (agent) to run the company. The owner's profit function is given by P = 500 - 5x, where x is the manager's effort level. The manager's cost function is given by C = 50 + 10x. If the owner offers the manager a salary of $200, what effort level will the manager choose to maximize their own profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the effort level that the manager will choose to maximize their own profit, we need to find the manager's profit function. The manager's profit function is the difference between their salary and their cost function:\n\nManager's Profit = Salary - Cost Function\n\nSince the salary is $200, the manager's profit function is:\n\nManager's Profit = 200 - (50 + 10x)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nManager's Profit = 150 - 10x\n\nNow, to maximize the manager's profit, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this function. To do this, we can take the derivative of the manager's profit function with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Manager's Profit)/dx = -10\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and does not depend on x, there is no maximum or minimum value for the manager's profit function. This means that the manager can choose any effort level, and their profit will always be the same.\n\nHowever, since the owner's profit function is P = 500 - 5x, the owner would prefer the manager to choose the lowest possible effort level (x = 0) to maximize the owner's profit. In this case, the manager's profit would be:\n\nManager's Profit = 150 - 10(0) = 150\n\nSo, the manager will choose an effort level of x = 0 to maximize their own profit, which will also maximize the owner's profit."
