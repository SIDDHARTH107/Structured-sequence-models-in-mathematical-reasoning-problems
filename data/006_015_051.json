    "message_1": "Of the total number of cyber attacks on a network, 30% are categorized as malware attacks. If there were 50 cyber attacks on a particular network, what is the probability that at least 20 of them were malware attacks?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 20 of the 50 cyber attacks were malware attacks, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the total number of cyber attacks)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of malware attacks)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a malware attack)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a non-malware attack)\n\nIn this problem, n = 50, p = 0.3 (30% probability of a malware attack), and we want to find the probability of at least 20 malware attacks, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 20 to k = 50.\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 20 to 50\n\nWe can calculate this using the binomial probability formula for each value of k and summing the results:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) ≈ 0.2106\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 of the 50 cyber attacks were malware attacks is approximately 21.06%."
