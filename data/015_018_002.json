    "message_2": "The method of harmonic balance involves assuming a solution of the form $x(t) = X \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$, where $X$ is the amplitude of the steady-state limit cycle and $\\phi$ is the phase difference. We will substitute this assumed solution into the given Duffing oscillator equation and balance the harmonics to find the amplitude $X$.\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of $x(t)$ with respect to time:\n\n$\\dot{x}(t) = -X\\omega \\sin(\\omega t - \\phi)$\n\n$\\ddot{x}(t) = -X\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$\n\nNow, substitute $x(t)$, $\\dot{x}(t)$, and $\\ddot{x}(t)$ into the given equation:\n\n$-X\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi) + \\delta(-X\\omega \\sin(\\omega t - \\phi)) + \\alpha(X \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)) + \\beta(X \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi))^3 = \\gamma \\cos(\\omega t)$\n\nNow, we will balance the harmonics by equating the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms:\n\nFor the cosine terms:\n\n$-X\\omega^2 + \\alpha X + \\beta X^3 = \\gamma$\n\nFor the sine terms:\n\n$-\\delta X\\omega = 0$\n\nSince $\\delta \\neq 0$ and $\\omega \\neq 0$, the sine equation implies that $X = 0$. However, this is a trivial solution, and we are interested in the non-trivial solution for the amplitude of the steady-state limit cycle. Therefore, we will focus on the cosine equation:\n\n$-X\\omega^2 + \\alpha X + \\beta X^3 = \\gamma$\n\nSubstitute the given values for $\\delta, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma,$ and $\\omega$:\n\n$-X\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 - X + X^3 = 0.3$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$X^3 - \\frac{5}{9}X = 0.3$\n\nThis is a cubic equation in $X$, which can be challenging to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the non-trivial solution for $X$. Using a numerical solver, we find:\n\n$X \\approx 0.618$\n\nThus, the amplitude of the steady-state limit cycle for the given Duffing oscillator is approximately $X \\approx 0.618$."
