    "message_2": "To find the value of x after 100 iterations of the logistic map equation, we can use a loop to calculate the value of x at each step. Here's the Python code to do this:\n\n```python\nx = 0.5\nfor i in range(100):\n    x = 4 * x * (1 - x)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, the value of x after 100 iterations is approximately 0.10116832444887708."
