    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can tell you that cohomology groups are concepts from algebraic topology and are not applicable to a simple geometric problem involving a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nCohomology groups are used to study topological spaces and their properties, while the problem you presented is a simple geometric problem. If you have any other questions related to the triangle or any other mathematical concept, feel free to ask."
