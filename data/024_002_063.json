    "message_2": "To find the geodesic on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we first need to find the metric tensor g_ij of the surface. The metric tensor is given by the dot product of the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to the coordinates.\n\nLet the position vector R = (x, y, x^2 + y^2). Then, the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂R/∂x = (1, 0, 2x)\n∂R/∂y = (0, 1, 2y)\n\nNow, we can compute the metric tensor g_ij:\n\ng_11 = (1, 0, 2x) • (1, 0, 2x) = 1 + 4x^2\ng_12 = g_21 = (1, 0, 2x) • (0, 1, 2y) = 4xy\ng_22 = (0, 1, 2y) • (0, 1, 2y) = 1 + 4y^2\n\nThe geodesic equations are given by the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n\nd/dt (∂L/∂(dx/dt)) - ∂L/∂x = 0\nd/dt (∂L/∂(dy/dt)) - ∂L/∂y = 0\n\nwhere L = (g_11 (dx/dt)^2 + 2g_12 (dx/dt)(dy/dt) + g_22 (dy/dt)^2)/2.\n\nTo solve these equations, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let x(t) = cos(θ(t)) and y(t) = sin(θ(t)). Then, dx/dt = -sin(θ(t)) dθ/dt and dy/dt = cos(θ(t)) dθ/dt.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the geodesic equations and simplifying, we obtain:\n\nd/dt ( (1 + 4cos^2(θ))(-sin(θ) dθ/dt) + 4cos(θ)sin(θ)(cos(θ) dθ/dt) ) = 0\nd/dt ( 4cos(θ)sin(θ)(-sin(θ) dθ/dt) + (1 + 4sin^2(θ))(cos(θ) dθ/dt) ) = 0\n\nThese equations are satisfied if dθ/dt = constant. Let dθ/dt = k. Then, θ(t) = kt + c, where c is the integration constant.\n\nNow, we can find the geodesic passing through the points (1,0,1) and (0,1,1). At t = 0, x(0) = 1 and y(0) = 0, so cos(θ(0)) = 1 and sin(θ(0)) = 0. This implies that θ(0) = 0, so c = 0.\n\nAt t = t_1, x(t_1) = 0 and y(t_1) = 1, so cos(θ(t_1)) = 0 and sin(θ(t_1)) = 1. This implies that θ(t_1) = π/2, so kt_1 = π/2, and k = (π/2)/t_1.\n\nThus, the geodesic is given by:\n\nx(t) = cos((π/2)(t/t_1))\ny(t) = sin((π/2)(t/t_1))\nz(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2\n\nThis is the equation of the geodesic passing through the points (1,0,1) and (0,1,1) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2."
