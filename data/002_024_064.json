    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 10cm and two parallel sides that measure 8cm and 12cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Since the trapezium has a height of 10cm, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the shorter base as a (8cm), the longer base as b (12cm), and the height as h (10cm). Let x be the length of one of the legs of the trapezium, and y be the length of the other leg.\n\nWe can form two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from the shorter base (a) to the longer base (b). The height (h) will be the same for both triangles.\n\nFor the first right triangle, we have:\na + (b - a) = b\n8 + (12 - 8) = 12\n\nFor the second right triangle, we have:\nx^2 = h^2 + (b - a)^2\nx^2 = 10^2 + (12 - 8)^2\nx^2 = 100 + 16\nx^2 = 116\nx = √116 ≈ 10.77cm\n\nFor the third right triangle, we have:\ny^2 = h^2 + a^2\ny^2 = 10^2 + 8^2\ny^2 = 100 + 64\ny^2 = 164\ny = √164 ≈ 12.81cm\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\nPerimeter = a + b + x + y\nPerimeter = 8 + 12 + 10.77 + 12.81\nPerimeter ≈ 43.58cm"
