    "message_1": "Suppose a car manufacturer claims that their cars get an average of 35 miles per gallon (mpg) on the highway. A sample of 50 cars driven on the highway is selected and the average mpg is found to be 32.5 with a standard deviation of 3.5. Perform a hypothesis test at a 5% level of significance to determine if the manufacturer's claim is supported by the sample data.",
    "message_2": "To perform a hypothesis test at a 5% level of significance, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).\n2. Determine the test statistic.\n3. Determine the critical value and the rejection region.\n4. Compare the test statistic to the critical value and make a decision.\n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1)\n\nH0: μ = 35 (The manufacturer's claim is true, and the average mpg is 35.)\nH1: μ ≠ 35 (The manufacturer's claim is false, and the average mpg is not 35.)\n\nStep 2: Determine the test statistic\n\nWe will use the t-test statistic since the population standard deviation is unknown. The formula for the t-test statistic is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nt = (32.5 - 35) / (3.5 / √50)\nt = (-2.5) / (3.5 / 7.071)\nt = -2.5 / 0.495\nt ≈ -5.05\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value and the rejection region\n\nWe are performing a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance, so we will use a t-distribution table to find the critical value. With 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49) and a 2.5% level of significance in each tail, the critical value is approximately ±2.009.\n\nThe rejection region is t < -2.009 or t > 2.009.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value and make a decision\n\nOur test statistic, t ≈ -5.05, falls into the rejection region (t < -2.009). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: At a 5% level of significance, we have enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim that their cars get an average of 35 miles per gallon on the highway. The sample data suggests that the average mpg is not 35."
