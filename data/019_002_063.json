    "message_1": "Using predicate logic, express the following sentence mathematically: \"All cats are mammals.\" Then, write the negation of the statement and determine its truth value using a truth table.",
    "message_2": "To express the sentence \"All cats are mammals\" in predicate logic, we can use the following notation:\n\n∀x (C(x) → M(x))\n\nHere, C(x) represents \"x is a cat\" and M(x) represents \"x is a mammal.\" The symbol ∀x means \"for all x,\" and the arrow (→) represents implication. So, the statement reads \"For all x, if x is a cat, then x is a mammal.\"\n\nThe negation of this statement would be:\n\n∃x (C(x) ∧ ¬M(x))\n\nThis reads \"There exists an x such that x is a cat and x is not a mammal.\"\n\nA truth table is not applicable in this case, as truth tables are used for propositional logic, not predicate logic. However, we can still determine the truth value of the negation based on our knowledge of the real world. Since all cats are indeed mammals, the original statement is true, and its negation is false."
