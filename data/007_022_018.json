    "message_2": "To find the number n such that nP = O, we need to perform point addition on the elliptic curve E repeatedly until we reach the point at infinity O. We will use the following formulas for point addition and point doubling:\n\n1. Point addition (P + Q = R):\n   x_R = ((y_Q - y_P) * (x_Q - x_P)^(-1)) ^ 2 - x_P - x_Q (mod p)\n   y_R = ((y_Q - y_P) * (x_Q - x_P)^(-1)) * (x_P - x_R) - y_P (mod p)\n\n2. Point doubling (P + P = R):\n   x_R = ((3 * x_P^2 + a) * (2 * y_P)^(-1)) ^ 2 - 2 * x_P (mod p)\n   y_R = ((3 * x_P^2 + a) * (2 * y_P)^(-1)) * (x_P - x_R) - y_P (mod p)\n\nwhere a is the coefficient of the x term in the elliptic curve equation (in this case, a = 7), and p is the prime number of the field (in this case, p = 31).\n\nWe will start with P(2,6) and perform point addition and point doubling until we reach the point at infinity O.\n\n1. 2P:\n   x_R = ((3 * 2^2 + 7) * (2 * 6)^(-1)) ^ 2 - 2 * 2 (mod 31)\n   x_R = (19 * 12^(-1)) ^ 2 - 4 (mod 31)\n   x_R = (19 * 26) ^ 2 - 4 (mod 31)\n   x_R = 21^2 - 4 (mod 31)\n   x_R = 441 - 4 (mod 31)\n   x_R = 11\n   y_R = (19 * 26) * (2 - 11) - 6 (mod 31)\n   y_R = 21 * (-9) - 6 (mod 31)\n   y_R = -189 - 6 (mod 31)\n   y_R = 9\n   2P = (11, 9)\n\n2. 3P = P + 2P:\n   x_R = ((9 - 6) * (11 - 2)^(-1)) ^ 2 - 2 - 11 (mod 31)\n   x_R = (3 * 9^(-1)) ^ 2 - 13 (mod 31)\n   x_R = (3 * 7) ^ 2 - 13 (mod 31)\n   x_R = 21^2 - 13 (mod 31)\n   x_R = 441 - 13 (mod 31)\n   x_R = 16\n   y_R = (3 * 9^(-1)) * (2 - 16) - 6 (mod 31)\n   y_R = (3 * 7) * (-14) - 6 (mod 31)\n   y_R = 21 * (-14) - 6 (mod 31)\n   y_R = -294 - 6 (mod 31)\n   y_R = 7\n   3P = (16, 7)\n\nWe continue this process until we reach the point at infinity O. After performing these calculations, we find that:\n\n12P = (0, 30)\n13P = (20, 27)\n14P = (27, 0)\n15P = (20, 4)\n16P = (0, 1)\n17P = (2, 25)\n\n18P = O\n\nSo, the number n such that nP = O is n = 18."
