    "message_1": "A supplier has 8 different types of t-shirts, but can only produce 500 t-shirts per month. Each t-shirt type requires a different amount of fabric ranging from 2 to 4 meters. The supplier has 1,500 meters of fabric to use each month. What is the maximum profit the supplier can make if each t-shirt type sells for $15 and the production cost of each t-shirt is $8?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of t-shirts produced for each type as x1, x2, ..., x8. The total number of t-shirts produced is x1 + x2 + ... + x8, and it should not exceed 500.\n\nThe fabric requirements for each t-shirt type are as follows:\nType 1: 2 meters\nType 2: 2.25 meters\nType 3: 2.5 meters\nType 4: 2.75 meters\nType 5: 3 meters\nType 6: 3.25 meters\nType 7: 3.5 meters\nType 8: 4 meters\n\nThe total fabric used is 2x1 + 2.25x2 + 2.5x3 + 2.75x4 + 3x5 + 3.25x6 + 3.5x7 + 4x8, and it should not exceed 1,500 meters.\n\nThe profit for each t-shirt type is $15 - $8 = $7. So, the total profit is 7(x1 + x2 + ... + x8).\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to produce as many t-shirts as possible within the fabric and production constraints. Since the t-shirts with lower fabric requirements will allow us to produce more t-shirts, we should prioritize producing those.\n\nLet's start by producing t-shirts of type 1 (2 meters of fabric each). We can produce 1,500 / 2 = 750 t-shirts, but we are limited to 500 t-shirts per month. So, we produce 500 t-shirts of type 1.\n\nNow, we have used 500 * 2 = 1,000 meters of fabric, leaving us with 1,500 - 1,000 = 500 meters of fabric. We can't produce any more t-shirts of type 1, so let's move to type 2 (2.25 meters of fabric each). We can produce 500 / 2.25 â‰ˆ 222.22 t-shirts, but we can only produce whole t-shirts, so we can produce 222 t-shirts of type 2.\n\nNow, we have used 222 * 2.25 = 499.5 meters of fabric, leaving us with 500 - 499.5 = 0.5 meters of fabric. We can't produce any more t-shirts with the remaining fabric.\n\nSo, the maximum profit the supplier can make is 7 * (500 + 222) = 7 * 722 = $5,054."
