    "message_1": "Suppose a company wishes to minimize the cost of producing a certain product. The cost function is given by C(x) = x^3 - 11x^2 + 32x + 6, where x is the number of units produced. What is the minimum cost and how many units should the company produce to achieve this minimum cost?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost, we need to find the critical points of the cost function C(x) by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero. Then, we will check the second derivative to determine if it's a minimum.\n\n1. Find the first derivative of C(x):\n\nC'(x) = 3x^2 - 22x + 32\n\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 22x + 32 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. In this case, we can factor it:\n\n(3x - 16)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = 2 or x = 16/3\n\n3. Find the second derivative of C(x):\n\nC''(x) = 6x - 22\n\n4. Check the second derivative for each critical point:\n\nC''(2) = 6(2) - 22 = -10 (Since this value is negative, we have a local maximum at x = 2)\n\nC''(16/3) = 6(16/3) - 22 = 10 (Since this value is positive, we have a local minimum at x = 16/3)\n\n5. Calculate the minimum cost:\n\nC(16/3) = (16/3)^3 - 11(16/3)^2 + 32(16/3) + 6 ≈ 122.37\n\nSo, the minimum cost is approximately 122.37, and the company should produce 16/3 ≈ 5.33 units. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, they should produce either 5 or 6 units. To determine which one results in a lower cost, we can compare the costs for 5 and 6 units:\n\nC(5) = 5^3 - 11(5)^2 + 32(5) + 6 = 125\nC(6) = 6^3 - 11(6)^2 + 32(6) + 6 = 126\n\nThus, the company should produce 5 units to achieve the minimum cost of 125."
