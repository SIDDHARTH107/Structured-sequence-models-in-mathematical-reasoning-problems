    "message_2": "A Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is constructed by recursively replacing each square in a grid with a cross shape made up of five smaller squares. The size of the fractal refers to the number of iterations performed in its construction.\n\nTo find the length of the line that passes through the middle of a Vicsek fractal of size 5, we need to determine the total length of the horizontal or vertical lines in the middle of the fractal after 5 iterations.\n\nLet's denote the length of the line after n iterations as L(n). Initially, for n = 0, we have a single square with side length 1, so L(0) = 1.\n\nIn each iteration, the length of the line increases by a factor of 3, as each square is replaced by a cross shape made up of five smaller squares, and the middle square contributes to the length of the line.\n\nSo, after 5 iterations, the length of the line will be:\n\nL(5) = L(0) * 3^5 = 1 * 3^5 = 1 * 243 = 243\n\nTherefore, the length of the line that passes through the middle of a Vicsek fractal of size 5 is 243."
