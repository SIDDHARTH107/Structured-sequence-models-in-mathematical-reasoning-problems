    "message_2": "To find the one-dimensional homology group H1(S) of a closed orientable surface S of genus g, we can use the classification theorem for closed surfaces. According to this theorem, a closed orientable surface of genus g is homeomorphic to a connected sum of g tori, denoted as T^2#T^2#...#T^2 (g times).\n\nNow, let's find the homology group of a single torus T^2. The torus can be constructed by identifying the opposite sides of a square. We can choose two loops on the torus, one going around the \"hole\" (call it loop a) and the other going around the \"tube\" (call it loop b). These loops generate the fundamental group of the torus, which is given by π1(T^2) = <a, b | aba^(-1)b^(-1)>.\n\nTo find the first homology group H1(T^2), we can use the abelianization of the fundamental group. The abelianization of a group G is the quotient group G/[G, G], where [G, G] is the commutator subgroup of G. In the case of the torus, the fundamental group is already abelian, so the first homology group is isomorphic to the fundamental group:\n\nH1(T^2) = π1(T^2) = <a, b | aba^(-1)b^(-1)> ≅ Z ⊕ Z.\n\nNow, let's find the homology group of the connected sum of g tori. Since homology groups are homotopy invariant, we can use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the homology groups of the connected sum. For the connected sum of g tori, we have:\n\nH1(S) = H1(T^2#T^2#...#T^2) ≅ H1(T^2) ⊕ H1(T^2) ⊕ ... ⊕ H1(T^2) (g times).\n\nSo, the one-dimensional homology group H1(S) of a closed orientable surface S of genus g is:\n\nH1(S) ≅ Z ⊕ Z ⊕ ... ⊕ Z ⊕ Z (g times) ≅ Z^g ⊕ Z^g.\n\nIn other words, H1(S) is a free abelian group of rank 2g."
