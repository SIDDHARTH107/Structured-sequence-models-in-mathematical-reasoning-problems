    "message_1": "A 50-meter tall building is situated at the top of a hill. A person standing at the bottom of the hill needs to look up at an angle of 30 degrees to see the top of the building. What's the length of the hill?",
    "message_2": "Let's use trigonometry to solve this problem. We can represent the situation as a right triangle, where the height of the building is the opposite side, the length of the hill is the adjacent side, and the angle of elevation is 30 degrees.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle, the opposite side, and the adjacent side:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\n\nIn this case, the angle is 30 degrees, and the opposite side (height of the building) is 50 meters. We want to find the adjacent side (length of the hill).\n\ntan(30) = 50 / adjacent\n\nTo find the adjacent side, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nadjacent = 50 / tan(30)\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of tan(30). In degrees, tan(30) is approximately 0.577.\n\nadjacent = 50 / 0.577\n\nadjacent â‰ˆ 86.6 meters\n\nSo, the length of the hill is approximately 86.6 meters."
