Is the statement true or false in this model? \n\n(c) Consider the model of arithmetic where the universe is the set of even natural numbers (i.e., those numbers that are divisible by 2), the interpretation of addition and multiplication are the usual ones, and the interpretation of the constant symbol 7 is the natural number 14. Is the statement true or false in this model?",
    "message_2": "(a) The statement is true. For every natural number n, there exists a natural number k such that k = n * 7. This is because the set of natural numbers is closed under multiplication, so the product of any two natural numbers is also a natural number.\n\n(b) In the model of arithmetic where the universe is the set of natural numbers, the statement is true. As mentioned in part (a), for every natural number n, there exists a natural number k such that k = n * 7. This holds true in this model since the interpretation of addition and multiplication are the usual ones, and the interpretation of the constant symbol 7 is the natural number 7.\n\n(c) In the model of arithmetic where the universe is the set of even natural numbers, the statement is false. In this model, the interpretation of the constant symbol 7 is the natural number 14. However, not all natural numbers n will have a corresponding even natural number k such that k = n * 14. For example, when n = 3, k = 3 * 14 = 42, which is an even number, but when n = 5, k = 5 * 14 = 70, which is not in the set of even natural numbers divisible by 2 (i.e., not an even number in this model)."
