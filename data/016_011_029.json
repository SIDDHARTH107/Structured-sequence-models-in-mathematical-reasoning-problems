    "message_2": "A Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is formed by iteratively removing the central square of each remaining square and adding squares at the corners. The order of the fractal represents the number of iterations.\n\nLet's first find the perimeter and area of the Vicsek fractal at each iteration.\n\nIteration 0 (Initial square):\nPerimeter: P0 = 4 * side length = 4 * 1 = 4\nArea: A0 = side length^2 = 1^2 = 1\n\nIteration 1:\nPerimeter: P1 = P0 * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16\nArea: A1 = A0 * (5/4) = 1 * (5/4) = 5/4\n\nIteration 2:\nPerimeter: P2 = P1 * 4 = 16 * 4 = 64\nArea: A2 = A1 * (5/4) = (5/4) * (5/4) = 25/16\n\nIteration 3:\nPerimeter: P3 = P2 * 4 = 64 * 4 = 256\nArea: A3 = A2 * (5/4) = (25/16) * (5/4) = 125/64\n\nIteration 4:\nPerimeter: P4 = P3 * 4 = 256 * 4 = 1024\nArea: A4 = A3 * (5/4) = (125/64) * (5/4) = 625/256\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the perimeter to the area for the 4th order Vicsek fractal:\n\nRatio = P4 / A4 = 1024 / (625/256) = (1024 * 256) / 625 = 262144 / 625 â‰ˆ 419.4304\n\nSo, the ratio of the perimeter of a Vicsek fractal with an order of 4 to its area, given that the side length of the initial square is 1 unit, is approximately 419.4304."
