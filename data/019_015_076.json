    "message_2": "To find the cardinality of the set of functions that map a set with four elements to a set with two elements, we need to determine the number of possible ways to assign each of the four elements in the domain to one of the two elements in the codomain.\n\nFor each of the four elements in the domain, there are two choices in the codomain. So, the number of possible functions is:\n\n2 (choices for the first element) × 2 (choices for the second element) × 2 (choices for the third element) × 2 (choices for the fourth element) = 2^4 = 16\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of functions that map a set with four elements to a set with two elements is 16."
