    "message_2": "A cut vertex (or articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph G, let's analyze each vertex and edge to determine the cut vertices and bridges.\n\n1. Removing vertex 1:\n```\n    2\n    |  \n    |  \n    |\n    3\n    | \n    | \n    4---5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components increases from 1 to 2. So, vertex 1 is a cut vertex.\n\n2. Removing vertex 2:\n```\n    1\n   /|     \n  / |     \n /  |     \n3   |     \n|   |     \n|   |     \n4---5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components increases from 1 to 2. So, vertex 2 is a cut vertex.\n\n3. Removing vertex 3:\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n    |    | \n    |    | \n    4---5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, vertex 3 is not a cut vertex.\n\n4. Removing vertex 4:\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n    |    | \n    5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, vertex 4 is not a cut vertex.\n\n5. Removing vertex 5:\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n|   |    | \n4        6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, vertex 5 is not a cut vertex.\n\n6. Removing vertex 6:\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n|   |    | \n4---5\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, vertex 6 is not a cut vertex.\n\nNow let's analyze the edges to find the bridges:\n\n1. Removing edge (1,2):\n```\n    1    2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n|   |    | \n|   |    | \n4---5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components increases from 1 to 2. So, edge (1,2) is a bridge.\n\n2. Removing edge (1,3):\n```\n    1----2\n     |    |  \n     |    |  \n     |    |\n    3     | \n    |     | \n    |     | \n    4---5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, edge (1,3) is not a bridge.\n\n3. Removing edge (1,4):\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n|   |    | \n|   |    | \n4---5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, edge (1,4) is not a bridge.\n\n4. Removing edge (2,6):\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n|   |    | \n|   |    | \n4---5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, edge (2,6) is not a bridge.\n\n5. Removing edge (3,4):\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n    |    | \n    |    | \n    4---5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, edge (3,4) is not a bridge.\n\n6. Removing edge (4,5):\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n|   |    | \n|   |    | \n4        5----6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, edge (4,5) is not a bridge.\n\n7. Removing edge (5,6):\n```\n    1----2\n   /|    |  \n  / |    |  \n /  |    |\n3   |    | \n|   |    | \n|   |    | \n4---5    6\n```\nThe number of connected components remains 1. So, edge (5,6) is not a bridge.\n\nIn conclusion, the cut vertices in the graph G are vertices 1 and 2, and the only bridge is edge (1,2)."
