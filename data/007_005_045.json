    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 15, 18, and 24, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n15 = 3 × 5\n18 = 2 × 3^2\n24 = 2^3 × 3\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the factorizations:\n2^3, 3^2, and 5\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\n2^3 × 3^2 × 5 = 8 × 9 × 5 = 72 × 5 = 360\n\nThe LCM of 15, 18, and 24 is 360."
