    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the area of a triangle whose base is 6 cm and height is 8 cm. What is the area of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 6 cm and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (6 * 8) / 2\n\nArea = 48 / 2\n\nArea = 24 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 24 square centimeters."
