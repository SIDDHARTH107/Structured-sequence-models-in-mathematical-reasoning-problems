    "message_2": "In geometric topology and knot theory, prime knots are classified by their crossing number, which is the minimum number of crossings in any diagram of the knot. The number of prime knots with 11 or fewer crossings is as follows:\n\n0 crossings: 0 knots (trivial knot)\n1 crossing: 0 knots\n2 crossings: 0 knots\n3 crossings: 1 knot (the trefoil knot)\n4 crossings: 1 knot (the figure-eight knot)\n5 crossings: 2 knots\n6 crossings: 3 knots\n7 crossings: 7 knots\n8 crossings: 21 knots\n9 crossings: 49 knots\n10 crossings: 165 knots\n11 crossings: 552 knots\n\nAdding these numbers together, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 7 + 21 + 49 + 165 + 552 = 801 different prime knots with 11 or fewer crossings."
