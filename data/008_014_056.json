    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |    x = | x |    b = | 4 |\n    | 2  3  1 |        | y |        | 1 |\n    | 3  5 -2 |        | z |        | 7 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (such as NumPy in Python), we get:\n\nQ = | -0.27 -0.63  0.73 |\n    | -0.54 -0.14 -0.66 |\n    | -0.80  0.76  0.22 |\n\nR = | -3.74 -6.48  2.16 |\n    |  0   -0.63 -2.46 |\n    |  0    0    0.44 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^Tb, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nQ^Tb = | -0.27  -0.54  -0.80 | | 4 |\n       | -0.63  -0.14   0.76 | | 1 |\n       |  0.73  -0.66   0.22 | | 7 |\n\nQ^Tb = | -5.46 |\n       |  2.97 |\n       | -0.20 |\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb:\n\n| -3.74 -6.48  2.16 | | x |   | -5.46 |\n|  0   -0.63 -2.46 | | y | = |  2.97 |\n|  0    0    0.44  | | z |   | -0.20 |\n\nWe can solve this system using back-substitution:\n\nz = -0.20 / 0.44 = -0.45\ny = (2.97 - (-2.46) * (-0.45)) / (-0.63) = 1.00\nx = (-5.46 - (-6.48) * 1.00 + 2.16 * (-0.45)) / (-3.74) = 1.00\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.00, y = 1.00, and z = -0.45 (rounded to two decimal places)."
