    "message_1": "Suppose we have a set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and a set B = {2, 3, 4, 5}. \n\nUsing the type theory concept, determine how many functions exist from set A to set B.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of functions from set A to set B, we need to consider that each element in set A can be mapped to any element in set B.\n\nSet A has 4 elements, and set B has 4 elements. So, for each element in set A, there are 4 choices in set B to map it to. Since there are 4 elements in set A, the total number of functions from set A to set B is:\n\n4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 4^4 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 functions from set A to set B."
