    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the medical condition, we multiply the population size by the probability of the condition occurring.\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = Population size × Probability of the condition\n= 10,000 × 0.05\n= 500\n\nSo, the expected number of people who will have the medical condition in this population is 500."
