The sample mean weight is 12.5 ounces and the sample standard deviation is 0.2 ounces. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average weight of a can of soda produced in the factory.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average weight of a can of soda produced in the factory, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Sample Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 12.5 ounces, the sample standard deviation is 0.2 ounces, and the sample size is 40 cans. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval with a large sample size (n > 30) is approximately 1.96 (from the z-table).\n\nConfidence Interval = 12.5 ± (1.96 * (0.2 / √40))\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 0.2 / √40 ≈ 0.03162\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.03162 ≈ 0.06198\n\nFinally, calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower Limit = 12.5 - 0.06198 ≈ 12.43802\nUpper Limit = 12.5 + 0.06198 ≈ 12.56198\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average weight of a can of soda produced in the factory is approximately (12.438, 12.562) ounces."
