    "message_2": "There are two groups of order 25 up to isomorphism. These groups are:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 25, denoted as C_25 or Z_25. This group is generated by a single element of order 25.\n\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted as C_5 × C_5 or Z_5 × Z_5. This group is generated by two elements, each of order 5, and their orders are relatively prime.\n\nBoth of these groups are abelian, and they are not isomorphic to each other. The first group is cyclic, while the second group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, as required."
