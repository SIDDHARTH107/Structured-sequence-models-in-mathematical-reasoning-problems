    "message_2": "To solve the complex number equation z^2 + z + 1 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-(1) ± √((1)^2 - 4(1)(1))) / 2(1)\nz = (-1 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the square root of -3 as the square root of 3 times the square root of -1, which is the imaginary unit i:\n\nz = (-1 ± √3i) / 2\n\nSo, the two complex solutions for the equation z^2 + z + 1 = 0 are:\n\nz1 = (-1 + √3i) / 2\nz2 = (-1 - √3i) / 2"
