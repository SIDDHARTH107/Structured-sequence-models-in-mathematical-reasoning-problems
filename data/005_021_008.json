    "message_2": "The bootstrapping technique involves resampling from the original sample with replacement to create new samples, calculating the mean of each new sample, and then using the distribution of these means to estimate the confidence interval for the population mean. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Resample with replacement from the original sample of 30 observations to create a new sample of the same size (30 observations). Do this many times (e.g., 1000 or more) to create a large number of new samples.\n\n2. Calculate the mean of each new sample.\n\n3. Arrange the means in ascending order and find the 2.5th percentile (the value below which 2.5% of the means lie) and the 97.5th percentile (the value below which 97.5% of the means lie). These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the population mean.\n\nSince we don't have the original sample of 30 observations, we cannot perform the bootstrapping technique directly. However, we can approximate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution, which is a common approach when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n\nHere's how to calculate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution:\n\n1. Calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean: SE = sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size) = 12 / sqrt(30) ≈ 2.19.\n\n2. Find the t-value for the 95% confidence level and 29 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1): Using a t-table or calculator, the t-value is approximately 2.045.\n\n3. Calculate the margin of error (ME): ME = t-value * SE ≈ 2.045 * 2.19 ≈ 4.48.\n\n4. Calculate the 95% confidence interval: (sample mean - ME, sample mean + ME) = (50 - 4.48, 50 + 4.48) = (45.52, 54.48).\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (45.52, 54.48)."
