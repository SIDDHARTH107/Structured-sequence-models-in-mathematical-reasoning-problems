So, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π/2 and then divide by the length of the interval (π/2 - 0 = π/2).\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2)) * ∫[0, π/2] sin(x) dx\n\nTo find the integral of sin(x), we know that:\n\n∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral from 0 to π/2:\n\n∫[0, π/2] sin(x) dx = [-cos(π/2) + cos(0)]\n\n= [0 + 1]\n\n= 1\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2)) * 1\n\n= 2/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = sin(x) on the interval [0, π/2] is 2/π."
