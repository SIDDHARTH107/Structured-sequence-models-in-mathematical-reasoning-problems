    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2 - 4xy - 5, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then set them equal to 0.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x:\n∂f/∂x = 2x - 4y\n\nPartial derivative with respect to y:\n∂f/∂y = 4y - 4x\n\nNow, we set both partial derivatives equal to 0 and solve for x and y:\n\n2x - 4y = 0\n4y - 4x = 0\n\nDivide the first equation by 2:\nx - 2y = 0\n\nDivide the second equation by 4:\ny - x = 0\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations simultaneously:\n\nx - 2y = 0\ny - x = 0\n\nAdd the two equations:\nx - 2y + y - x = 0\n-y = 0\n\nSo, y = 0. Substitute y back into the second equation:\n\n0 - x = 0\nx = 0\n\nThus, the critical point is (0, 0).\n\nNow, we need to determine whether this critical point is a minimum, maximum, or saddle point. To do this, we'll use the second partial derivative test. We need to find the second partial derivatives of f:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 2\n∂²f/∂y² = 4\n∂²f/∂x∂y = -4\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\nD = (∂²f/∂x²)(∂²f/∂y²) - (∂²f/∂x∂y)²\nD = (2)(4) - (-4)²\nD = 8 - 16\nD = -8\n\nSince D < 0, the critical point (0, 0) is a saddle point."
