    "message_1": "A study was conducted to determine the length of time (in months) that a particular brand of smartphone lasts before it needs to be replaced. After following 500 participants over a period of two years, it was found that the survival function for the smartphone was: \nS(t) = 0.8^(t/20), where t is the time (in months) since purchase. \n\nWhat is the probability that the smartphone will last at least 12 months before it needs to be replaced?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the smartphone will last at least 12 months before it needs to be replaced, we need to evaluate the survival function S(t) at t = 12 months.\n\nS(12) = 0.8^(12/20)\n\nS(12) = 0.8^0.6\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nS(12) â‰ˆ 0.8912\n\nSo, the probability that the smartphone will last at least 12 months before it needs to be replaced is approximately 0.8912 or 89.12%."
