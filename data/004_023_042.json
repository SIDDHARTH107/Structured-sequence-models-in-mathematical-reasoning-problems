    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves, we need to first find the points where they intersect. We can do this by setting y = x^2 equal to y = 4x - x^2:\n\nx^2 = 4x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 4x\n\nx^2 = 2x\n\nx = 0 or x = 2\n\nNow we know that the curves intersect at x = 0 and x = 2, which are also the limits of our interval.\n\nNext, we need to find the difference between the two functions:\n\n(4x - x^2) - x^2 = 4x - 2x^2\n\nNow we can integrate this difference function over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nâˆ«(4x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nTo integrate, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\n(4x^2 / 2) - (2x^3 / 3) + C = 2x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow we evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of our interval:\n\n[2(2)^2 - (2/3)(2)^3] - [2(0)^2 - (2/3)(0)^3] = [8 - (16/3)] - [0] = (8/3)\n\nSo the area between the two curves within the interval from x = 0 to x = 2 is 8/3 square units."
