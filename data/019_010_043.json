    "message_2": "In linear logic, the tensor product (⊗) is used to represent the combination of resources, and the linear implication (⊸) is used to represent the transformation of resources.\n\nTo evaluate the expression (2 ⊗ 3) ⊸ (4 ⊸ 5), we need to understand how the resources are being transformed.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the tensor product (2 ⊗ 3). This represents the combination of resources 2 and 3. In linear logic, we don't perform any arithmetic operations on the numbers, so we can represent this combination as (2, 3).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the linear implication (4 ⊸ 5). This represents the transformation of resource 4 into resource 5. We can represent this transformation as a function f, where f(4) = 5.\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate the linear implication of the combined resources (2, 3) and the transformation function f. This means we need to find a way to use the resources (2, 3) to achieve the transformation f(4) = 5.\n\nSince we are working with linear logic, we can't simply add, subtract, multiply, or divide the resources. Instead, we need to think about how the resources (2, 3) can be used to achieve the transformation f(4) = 5.\n\nOne possible way to achieve this transformation is to use resource 2 to replace resource 4 and use resource 3 to replace resource 5. In this case, the transformation function f would be defined as f(2) = 3.\n\nSo, the expression (2 ⊗ 3) ⊸ (4 ⊸ 5) evaluates to the transformation function f(2) = 3 in linear logic."
