    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain stock price increase is 0.6, and the probability of a certain stock price decrease is 0.4. If the initial stock price is $100, what is the expected value of the stock price?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the stock price, we need to know the possible outcomes and their probabilities. In this case, we have two possible outcomes: the stock price increases or decreases. \n\nLet's assume the stock price increases by x% and decreases by y%. Then, the expected value can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of Increase * Increase Amount) + (Probability of Decrease * Decrease Amount)\n\nExpected Value = (0.6 * (100 + x% * 100)) + (0.4 * (100 - y% * 100))\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine the exact values of x% and y%. Therefore, we cannot calculate the expected value of the stock price without knowing the percentage increase and decrease amounts."
