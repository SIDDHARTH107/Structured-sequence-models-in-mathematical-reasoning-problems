The wire has a resistance of 5 Ohms/meter and is surrounded by air with a magnetic permeability of 4π x 10^-7 H/m. Determine the amplitude of the magnetic field produced by the current if it is uniformly distributed along the wire.",
    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude of the magnetic field produced by the current, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of the medium (in this case, air), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nHowever, we are given the resistance per meter (5 Ohms/meter) and the total length of the wire (10 meters), but not the current. To find the current, we can use Ohm's Law:\n\nV = I * R\n\nwhere V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the total resistance. Since we are not given the voltage, we cannot directly find the current. Instead, we can express the magnetic field amplitude in terms of the voltage and other given parameters.\n\nFirst, let's find the total resistance of the wire:\n\nR_total = resistance per meter * length = 5 Ohms/meter * 10 meters = 50 Ohms\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ohm's Law in terms of the current:\n\nI = V / R_total\n\nSubstitute this expression for the current into Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * (V / R_total)) / (2 * π * r)\n\nNow, plug in the given values for μ₀ and R_total:\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 H/m * (V / 50 Ohms)) / (2 * π * r)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nB = (2 * 10^-7 * V) / r\n\nThe amplitude of the magnetic field produced by the current is (2 * 10^-7 * V) / r, where V is the voltage and r is the distance from the wire. Without the voltage value, we cannot determine the exact amplitude of the magnetic field."
