    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a graph that may not be planar, we can use the generalization of Euler's formula for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere g is the genus of the surface.\n\nWe are given that the graph G has 14 vertices (V = 14) and 22 edges (E = 22). To find the genus, we need to find the minimum value of g such that the inequality holds:\n\n14 - 22 + F = 2 - 2g\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nF = 2g - 10\n\nSince F must be a non-negative integer, we can try different values of g to find the minimum value that satisfies the inequality:\n\nFor g = 1:\nF = 2(1) - 10 = -8 (not valid, as F must be non-negative)\n\nFor g = 2:\nF = 2(2) - 10 = -6 (not valid, as F must be non-negative)\n\nFor g = 3:\nF = 2(3) - 10 = -4 (not valid, as F must be non-negative)\n\nFor g = 4:\nF = 2(4) - 10 = -2 (not valid, as F must be non-negative)\n\nFor g = 5:\nF = 2(5) - 10 = 0 (valid)\n\nThus, the minimum value of g that satisfies the inequality is g = 5. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 5."
