    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 4 new segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, N = 4 and S = 3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the fifth iteration is approximately 1.2619. Note that the dimension does not change with the number of iterations, as it is a property of the curve itself, not a specific iteration."
