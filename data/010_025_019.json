Show that if T is a Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) such that T(S^1) = V, where V is a finite dimensional vector space, then T(X) is a finite dimensional vector space of dimension equal to the dimension of V raised to the power of the rank of π. \n\nFind the dimension of T(X) given that π = Z x Z and T(S^1) is 3-dimensional vector space.",
    "message_2": "To show that T(X) is a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension equal to the dimension of V raised to the power of the rank of π, we will use the properties of TQFTs and the given information about the fundamental group and T(S^1).\n\nFirst, recall that a TQFT associates a vector space to each closed 1-dimensional manifold (such as S^1) and a linear map to each cobordism between such manifolds. In particular, T(S^1) = V is a finite-dimensional vector space with dimension dim(V).\n\nNow, let's consider the fundamental group π = Z x Z. The rank of this group is 2, as it is the free product of two copies of the integers Z. \n\nNext, we need to understand how T(X) is related to T(S^1) and the fundamental group π. Since X is a connected topological space, we can consider the universal cover of X, denoted by X~. The fundamental group π acts on X~ by deck transformations, and this action induces a representation of π on the vector space T(X~). \n\nBy the properties of TQFTs, T(X~) is isomorphic to the tensor product of T(S^1) with itself, i.e., T(X~) = T(S^1) ⊗ T(S^1). Therefore, the dimension of T(X~) is the square of the dimension of T(S^1), i.e., dim(T(X~)) = (dim(V))^2.\n\nNow, we can relate T(X) to T(X~) by considering the action of the fundamental group π on T(X~). The vector space T(X) is isomorphic to the space of π-invariant vectors in T(X~), i.e., T(X) = T(X~)^π. \n\nSince π has rank 2, the number of π-invariant vectors in T(X~) is equal to the dimension of V raised to the power of the rank of π, i.e., dim(T(X)) = (dim(V))^rank(π).\n\nGiven that π = Z x Z and T(S^1) is a 3-dimensional vector space, we have rank(π) = 2 and dim(V) = 3. Therefore, the dimension of T(X) is:\n\ndim(T(X)) = (dim(V))^rank(π) = (3)^2 = 9.\n\nSo, T(X) is a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension 9."
