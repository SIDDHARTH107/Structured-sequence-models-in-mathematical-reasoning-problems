    "message_2": "To find the genus of a graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, this formula is only applicable to planar graphs. To determine if a graph is planar or not, we can use the Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nIn our case, we have a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. We can't directly determine if this graph is planar or not without more information about its structure. However, we can find the genus of the graph using the inequality:\n\ne ≤ 3v + 6g - 12\n\nwhere e is the number of edges, v is the number of vertices, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nRearranging the inequality to solve for g, we get:\n\ng ≥ (e - 3v + 12) / 6\n\nPlugging in the given values for v and e:\n\ng ≥ (15 - 3 * 10 + 12) / 6\ng ≥ (-15) / 6\n\nSince the genus must be a non-negative integer, the minimum genus for this graph is 0. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is planar. To determine the exact genus, we would need more information about the structure of the graph."
