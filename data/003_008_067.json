    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we first need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Since we know one acute angle (30 degrees) and the length of the hypotenuse (12 cm), we can use the sine and cosine functions to find the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's call the side opposite the 30-degree angle \"a\" and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle \"b\".\n\nUsing the sine function:\nsin(30) = a / 12\na = 12 * sin(30)\na = 12 * 0.5 (since sin(30) = 0.5)\na = 6 cm\n\nUsing the cosine function:\ncos(30) = b / 12\nb = 12 * cos(30)\nb = 12 * (√3 / 2) (since cos(30) = √3 / 2)\nb = 6√3 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of both sides, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * a * b\nArea = (1/2) * 6 * 6√3\nArea = 3 * 6√3\nArea = 18√3 cm²"
