    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard measures 16 inches by 20 inches. Suppose you want to cut out identical squares from each corner of the cardboard and then bend up the sides to form an open-top box. What should be the size of the square cutouts to maximize the volume of the box, subject to the constraint that the box has a height of 6 inches?\n(Note: The volume of a box is given by the product of its length, width, and height.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cutouts. After cutting out the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 20 - 2x\nWidth: 16 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nSince the height of the box is given as 6 inches, we have x = 6.\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the box:\n\nLength: 20 - 2(6) = 20 - 12 = 8 inches\nWidth: 16 - 2(6) = 16 - 12 = 4 inches\n\nSo, the size of the square cutouts should be 6 inches to maximize the volume of the box with a height constraint of 6 inches."
