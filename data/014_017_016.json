    "message_1": "Assuming we have a ciphertext with 400 characters encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, and the most frequent letter in the ciphertext is \"L\" which appears 48 times, what is the approximate percentage frequency of the letter \"L\" in the original plaintext?",
    "message_2": "In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a corresponding letter in the ciphertext. Since the frequency of letters in the ciphertext corresponds to the frequency of letters in the plaintext, we can calculate the percentage frequency of the letter \"L\" in the original plaintext as follows:\n\nPercentage frequency of \"L\" = (Number of times \"L\" appears / Total number of characters) * 100\n\nPercentage frequency of \"L\" = (48 / 400) * 100\n\nPercentage frequency of \"L\" = 0.12 * 100\n\nPercentage frequency of \"L\" = 12%\n\nSo, the approximate percentage frequency of the letter \"L\" in the original plaintext is 12%."
