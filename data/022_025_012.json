    "message_2": "Given the Schrodinger equation:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2 \\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \\psi(x) = E \\psi(x)$\n\nWe are given the mass $m = 2 \\text{ kg}$, energy $E = 10 \\text{ J}$, and potential energy function $V(x) = 5x^2 \\text{ J}$. We want to solve for the wave function $\\psi(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the Schrodinger equation with the given values:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} \\frac{d^2 \\psi(x)}{dx^2} + 5x^2 \\psi(x) = 10 \\psi(x)$\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation to make it look like a standard eigenvalue problem:\n\n$\\frac{d^2 \\psi(x)}{dx^2} + \\frac{4}{\\hbar^2}(10 - 5x^2) \\psi(x) = 0$\n\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a variable coefficient. Unfortunately, this ODE does not have a general analytical solution. However, we can try to find an approximate solution or solve it numerically.\n\nOne common approach to solving this type of ODE is to use the WKB approximation, which is valid when the potential energy function varies slowly compared to the wavelength of the wave function. The WKB approximation gives an approximate solution of the form:\n\n$\\psi(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p(x)}} \\exp \\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\int p(x) dx \\right)$\n\nwhere $p(x) = \\sqrt{2m(E - V(x))}$.\n\nIn our case, $p(x) = \\sqrt{2(2)(10 - 5x^2)} = 2\\sqrt{20 - 10x^2}$. Thus, the WKB approximation for the wave function is:\n\n$\\psi(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{20 - 10x^2}}} \\exp \\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\int 2\\sqrt{20 - 10x^2} dx \\right)$\n\nThe integral in the exponent does not have a simple analytical solution, so we would need to evaluate it numerically or use further approximations to find an approximate solution for the wave function.\n\nAlternatively, one could use numerical methods like the finite difference method or the shooting method to solve the Schrodinger equation directly for the wave function $\\psi(x)$."
