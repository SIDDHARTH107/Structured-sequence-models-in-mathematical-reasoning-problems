    "message_1": "Sorry, I cannot provide a precise numerical problem for paraconsistent logic as the principles of paraconsistent logic do not rely on numerical values or computations. Paraconsistent logic is a logical system that allows for the acceptance of inconsistent or contradictory statements. Therefore, it deals with more abstract concepts and does not involve numerical problem-solving. Would you like me to suggest a different topic or subtopic for a math question?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Here are a few different topics and subtopics in mathematics that you can choose from for a math question:\n\n1. Algebra: Linear equations, quadratic equations, polynomials, or systems of equations.\n2. Geometry: Angles, triangles, circles, polygons, or coordinate geometry.\n3. Trigonometry: Sine, cosine, tangent, or inverse trigonometric functions.\n4. Calculus: Limits, derivatives, integrals, or differential equations.\n5. Probability and Statistics: Combinations, permutations, probability distributions, or descriptive statistics.\n\nPlease let me know which topic or subtopic you would like a math question from, and I will be happy to provide one for you."
