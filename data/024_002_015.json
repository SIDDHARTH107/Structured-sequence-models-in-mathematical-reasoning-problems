    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve on the surface $z = 3x^2 + 4y^2$ that passes through the points $(1, 0, 7)$ and $(0, 1, 16)$, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equations.\n\nFirst, let's parameterize the curve on the surface as $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$. Since the curve lies on the surface, we have $z(t) = 3x(t)^2 + 4y(t)^2$. The geodesic curve is the shortest path between the two points, so we want to minimize the arc length of the curve.\n\nThe arc length of a parameterized curve is given by the integral $L = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2} dt$, where $\\dot{x} = \\frac{dx}{dt}$, $\\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt}$, and $\\dot{z} = \\frac{dz}{dt}$. Using the constraint $z(t) = 3x(t)^2 + 4y(t)^2$, we can write $\\dot{z} = 6x\\dot{x} + 8y\\dot{y}$.\n\nNow, we want to minimize the arc length $L$. To do this, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equations. Let $F(x, y, z, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y}, \\dot{z}) = \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}$. Then, the Euler-Lagrange equations are given by:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\\right) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{y}}\\right) = 0$\n\nSince $F$ does not depend explicitly on $x$ and $y$, these equations simplify to:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\\right) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{y}}\\right) = 0$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}}$\n\nSince the time derivatives of these expressions are zero, we have:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}}\\right) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}}\\right) = 0$\n\nThese equations imply that the quantities $\\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}}$ and $\\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}}$ are constants. Let's call them $c_1$ and $c_2$, respectively.\n\nNow, we can write:\n\n$\\dot{x} = c_1\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}$\n\n$\\dot{y} = c_2\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}$\n\nSquaring both equations and adding them, we get:\n\n$\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 = (c_1^2 + c_2^2)(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2)$\n\nSince $\\dot{z} = 6x\\dot{x} + 8y\\dot{y}$, we can substitute this expression into the equation above:\n\n$\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 = (c_1^2 + c_2^2)(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + (6x\\dot{x} + 8y\\dot{y})^2)$\n\nThis is a second-order differential equation in $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. Solving this equation with the boundary conditions $x(0) = 1$, $y(0) = 0$, $x(1) = 0$, and $y(1) = 1$ will give us the geodesic curve on the surface.\n\nHowever, solving this differential equation analytically is quite challenging. In practice, one would typically use numerical methods to find an approximate solution for the geodesic curve."
