    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern where each square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the central square is removed in each iteration. \n\nLet's denote the total number of squares in the nth iteration as S(n). In the 0th iteration, there is only one square, so S(0) = 1.\n\nIn the 1st iteration, the initial square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the central square is removed, leaving 8 squares. So, S(1) = 8.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 smaller squares, and the central square is removed. This means that for each square in the previous iteration, 8 new squares are added. Therefore, S(n) = 8 * S(n-1).\n\nNow, we can find the total number of squares in the 5th iteration:\n\nS(2) = 8 * S(1) = 8 * 8 = 64\nS(3) = 8 * S(2) = 8 * 64 = 512\nS(4) = 8 * S(3) = 8 * 512 = 4096\nS(5) = 8 * S(4) = 8 * 4096 = 32768\n\nSo, the total number of squares in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski carpet fractal is 32,768."
