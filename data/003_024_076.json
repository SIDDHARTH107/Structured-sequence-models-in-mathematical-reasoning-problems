    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector u onto vector v, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors to find the cosine of the angle between them.\n\nThe dot product of u and v is given by:\n\nu · v = (4)(2) + (-3)(6) = 8 - 18 = -10\n\nThe magnitudes of the vectors u and v are given by:\n\n||u|| = √(4^2 + (-3)^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n||v|| = √(2^2 + 6^2) = √(4 + 36) = √40 = 2√10\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle between the vectors using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| ||v||) = (-10) / (5 * 2√10) = -1 / √10\n\nNow that we have the cosine of the angle between the vectors, we can find the projection of vector u onto vector v using the formula:\n\nproj_v(u) = ||u|| * cos(θ) * (v / ||v||)\n\nThe unit vector of v is given by:\n\nv / ||v|| = (2 / 2√10, 6 / 2√10) = (1 / √10, 3 / √10)\n\nNow, we can find the projection of vector u onto vector v:\n\nproj_v(u) = (5 * -1 / √10) * (1 / √10, 3 / √10) = (-5 / √10) * (1 / √10, 3 / √10)\n\nproj_v(u) = (-5 / 10, -15 / 10) = (-1/2, -3/2)\n\nSo, the projection of vector u onto vector v is (-1/2, -3/2)."
