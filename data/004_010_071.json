    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x + 1, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2, we will use the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, the antiderivative of 3x^2 is:\n\n(3x^(2+1))/(2+1) + C1 = (3x^3)/3 + C1 = x^3 + C1\n\nFor the second term, 5x, we will again use the power rule:\n\n(5x^(1+1))/(1+1) + C2 = (5x^2)/2 + C2\n\nAnd for the third term, 1, we will also use the power rule:\n\n(1x^(0+1))/(0+1) + C3 = x + C3\n\nNow, we will combine the antiderivatives of each term:\n\nF(x) = x^3 + (5x^2)/2 + x + C\n\nHere, C = C1 + C2 + C3 is the combined constant of integration."
