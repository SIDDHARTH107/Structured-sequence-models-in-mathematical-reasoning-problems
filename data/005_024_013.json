    "message_2": "To find the number of values that fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean, we need to determine the range of values that are within 2 standard deviations.\n\nMean (μ) = 25\nStandard Deviation (σ) = 5\n\nLower limit = μ - 2σ = 25 - 2(5) = 25 - 10 = 15\nUpper limit = μ + 2σ = 25 + 2(5) = 25 + 10 = 35\n\nSo, the range of values within 2 standard deviations of the mean is 15 to 35.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of values in the data set that fall within this range. Since we don't have the actual data set, we can only determine the percentage of values that should fall within this range based on the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule) for normal distributions.\n\nThe empirical rule states that approximately 95% of the values in a normal distribution fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Since there are 50 values in the data set, we can calculate the number of values within 2 standard deviations as follows:\n\nNumber of values within 2 standard deviations = 0.95 * 50 = 47.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a value, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round up to 48.\n\nTherefore, approximately 48 values in the data set fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean."
