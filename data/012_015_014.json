    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or not, we can use the Handshaking Lemma. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph.\n\nLet's denote the number of vertices with degree 3 as x and the number of vertices with degree 4 as y. Since there are 10 vertices in total, we have:\n\nx + y = 10\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of the degrees of all vertices:\n\n3x + 4y = total degrees\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Lemma, the total degrees should be an even number (since it is twice the number of edges). We can analyze the possible values of x and y to see if the graph can be connected.\n\nCase 1: x is even, y is even\nIf both x and y are even, their sum (x + y) will be even, and the total degrees (3x + 4y) will also be even. This case satisfies the Handshaking Lemma.\n\nCase 2: x is odd, y is odd\nIf both x and y are odd, their sum (x + y) will be even, but the total degrees (3x + 4y) will be odd, which does not satisfy the Handshaking Lemma. This case cannot result in a connected graph.\n\nSince we have one case that satisfies the Handshaking Lemma, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, without more information about the specific connections between vertices, we cannot definitively say whether the given graph is connected or not."
