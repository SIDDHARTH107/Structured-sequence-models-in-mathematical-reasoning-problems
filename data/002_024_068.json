    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm, a base of 10 cm, and non-parallel sides of length 5 cm and 7 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other base. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to do this. Let's call the length of the other base b.\n\nWe can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from the vertex where the 5 cm and 7 cm sides meet to the base of 10 cm. Let's call the point where this line intersects the base of 10 cm point D.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles: one with sides 5 cm, 8 cm, and the other with sides 7 cm, 8 cm. Let's call the length of the segment from the left vertex of the trapezium to point D as x. Then, the length of the segment from point D to the right vertex of the trapezium is (10 - x).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the left triangle:\nx^2 + 8^2 = 5^2\nx^2 + 64 = 25\nx^2 = -39\n\nSince we cannot have a negative value for x^2, there must be an error in the problem statement. The given dimensions do not form a trapezium. Please check the dimensions and try again."
