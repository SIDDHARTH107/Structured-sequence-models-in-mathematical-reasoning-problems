    "message_2": "To find the time $t_0$ at which the car achieves an average speed equal to its instantaneous speed, we first need to find the displacement function $s(t)$ and then calculate the average speed.\n\nThe displacement function $s(t)$ can be found by integrating the velocity function $v(t)$:\n\n$$s(t) = \\int v(t) dt = \\int (t^2 - 3t + 5) dt$$\n\n$$s(t) = \\frac{1}{3}t^3 - \\frac{3}{2}t^2 + 5t + C$$\n\nNow, let's find the average speed from time $0$ to time $t_0$. The average speed is given by the total displacement divided by the time interval:\n\n$$\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{s(t_0) - s(0)}{t_0 - 0}$$\n\nSince $s(0) = C$, we have:\n\n$$\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{s(t_0) - C}{t_0}$$\n\nWe want the average speed to be equal to the instantaneous speed at time $t_0$, which is given by the velocity function $v(t_0) = t_0^2 - 3t_0 + 5$. Therefore, we set the average speed equal to the instantaneous speed:\n\n$$\\frac{s(t_0) - C}{t_0} = t_0^2 - 3t_0 + 5$$\n\nNow, substitute the displacement function $s(t_0)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}t_0^3 - \\frac{3}{2}t_0^2 + 5t_0 + C - C}{t_0} = t_0^2 - 3t_0 + 5$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{3}t_0^2 - \\frac{3}{2}t_0 + 5 = t_0^2 - 3t_0 + 5$$\n\nSubtract $\\frac{1}{3}t_0^2$ from both sides:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{2}t_0 + 5 = \\frac{2}{3}t_0^2 - 3t_0 + 5$$\n\nSubtract $5$ from both sides:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{2}t_0 = \\frac{2}{3}t_0^2 - 3t_0$$\n\nAdd $\\frac{1}{2}t_0$ to both sides:\n\n$$0 = \\frac{2}{3}t_0^2 - \\frac{5}{2}t_0$$\n\nFactor out $t_0$:\n\n$$0 = t_0(\\frac{2}{3}t_0 - \\frac{5}{2})$$\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for $t_0$:\n\n1) $t_0 = 0$\n\n2) $\\frac{2}{3}t_0 - \\frac{5}{2} = 0$\n\nFor the second solution, solve for $t_0$:\n\n$$\\frac{2}{3}t_0 = \\frac{5}{2}$$\n\n$$t_0 = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\n$$t_0 = \\frac{15}{4}$$\n\nThe first solution, $t_0 = 0$, corresponds to the initial time, which is not what we are looking for. Therefore, the time $t_0$ at which the car achieves an average speed equal to its instantaneous speed is $t_0 = \\frac{15}{4}$ seconds."
