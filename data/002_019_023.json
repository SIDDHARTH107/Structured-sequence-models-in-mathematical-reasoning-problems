    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle with a radius of 4 cm. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. \n\nA_base = π(4 cm)^2 = 16π cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. To do this, we first need to find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem since we have a right circular cone:\n\nl^2 = r^2 + h^2\n\nwhere l is the slant height, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nl^2 = (4 cm)^2 + (12 cm)^2 = 16 cm^2 + 144 cm^2 = 160 cm^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the slant height:\n\nl = √(160 cm^2) ≈ 12.65 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area using the formula:\n\nA_lateral = πr * l\n\nA_lateral = π(4 cm)(12.65 cm) ≈ 50.27π cm^2\n\nFinally, add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 16π cm^2 + 50.27π cm^2 ≈ 66.27π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the right circular cone is approximately 66.27π cm^2 or 208.08 cm^2."
