    "message_2": "There are 14 non-isomorphic groups of order 40. Here are examples of each type:\n\n1. Cyclic group C40: This group consists of integers modulo 40 under addition. It is generated by a single element, for example, 1.\n\n2. Dihedral group D20: This group consists of symmetries of a regular 20-gon, including rotations and reflections. It has 20 elements of rotations and 20 elements of reflections.\n\n3-10. Eight non-abelian groups of order 40:\n\n3. C2 x D20: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the dihedral group D20.\n\n4. C4 x D10: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 4 and the dihedral group D10.\n\n5. C5 x D8: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 5 and the dihedral group D8.\n\n6. C8 x D5: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 8 and the dihedral group D5.\n\n7. C10 x D4: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 10 and the dihedral group D4.\n\n8. C20 x D2: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 20 and the dihedral group D2.\n\n9. Q40: This group is the generalized quaternion group of order 40.\n\n10. SD40: This group is the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 5.\n\n11-14. Four abelian groups of order 40:\n\n11. C2 x C2 x C10: This group is the direct product of three cyclic groups of orders 2, 2, and 10.\n\n12. C2 x C4 x C5: This group is the direct product of three cyclic groups of orders 2, 4, and 5.\n\n13. C4 x C10: This group is the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 4 and 10.\n\n14. C5 x C8: This group is the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 8."
