    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in a space. In the context of the given metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we are looking for transformations that preserve the Euclidean distance between points.\n\nThere are four types of isometries in the Euclidean plane:\n\n1. Translations\n2. Rotations\n3. Reflections\n4. Glide reflections\n\n1. Translations:\nA translation is a transformation that moves every point in the plane by a fixed distance in a fixed direction. The transformation can be represented as:\n\n$T(x, y) = (x + a, y + b)$\n\nwhere $(a, b)$ is the translation vector.\n\n2. Rotations:\nA rotation is a transformation that rotates every point in the plane around a fixed point (called the center of rotation) by a fixed angle. The transformation can be represented as:\n\n$R(x, y) = (x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta + a, x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta + b)$\n\nwhere $(a, b)$ is the center of rotation and $\\theta$ is the angle of rotation.\n\n3. Reflections:\nA reflection is a transformation that reflects every point in the plane across a fixed line (called the axis of reflection). The transformation can be represented as:\n\n$M(x, y) = (x \\cos 2\\alpha + y \\sin 2\\alpha, x \\sin 2\\alpha - y \\cos 2\\alpha)$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the angle between the x-axis and the axis of reflection.\n\n4. Glide reflections:\nA glide reflection is a transformation that combines a reflection across a line with a translation parallel to that line. The transformation can be represented as:\n\n$G(x, y) = (x \\cos 2\\alpha + y \\sin 2\\alpha + a, x \\sin 2\\alpha - y \\cos 2\\alpha + b)$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the angle between the x-axis and the axis of reflection, and $(a, b)$ is the translation vector parallel to the axis of reflection.\n\nIn summary, the isometries of the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections."
