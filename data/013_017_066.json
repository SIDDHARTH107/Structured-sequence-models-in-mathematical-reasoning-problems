The dealership knows that the high-quality cars are worth $40,000 on average and the low-quality cars are worth $20,000 on average. However, the dealership cannot tell them apart by simply looking at them. Instead, half of the cars they purchase are high-quality and half are low-quality. The dealership offers a warranty for any car purchased for $5,000. Customers who buy the warranty can return their car for a full refund within a year. Without the warranty, customers cannot return their car. Assuming customers only buy a warranty if they think the car is low-quality, what is the expected value of the cars that the dealership sells?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. Half of the cars are high-quality (worth $40,000) and half are low-quality (worth $20,000).\n2. Customers buy a warranty for $5,000 if they think the car is low-quality.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value of the cars that the dealership sells:\n\n- For high-quality cars, customers will not buy the warranty, so the dealership sells them for $40,000.\n- For low-quality cars, customers will buy the warranty, so the dealership sells them for $20,000 + $5,000 = $25,000.\n\nSince half of the cars are high-quality and half are low-quality, the expected value of the cars that the dealership sells can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected Value = (0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $25,000)\nExpected Value = ($20,000) + ($12,500)\nExpected Value = $32,500\n\nSo, the expected value of the cars that the dealership sells is $32,500."
