The winner of the game is the player whose number is closest to (2/3) times the average of all the numbers chosen. What number should you choose to maximize your chances of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that all the players are rational and will choose a number to maximize their chances of winning. In this case, we can use game theory to find the optimal strategy.\n\nLet x be the average of all the numbers chosen by the players. Then, the target number to win the game is (2/3)x. Since each player chooses a number between 0 and 100, the average x will also be between 0 and 100.\n\nNow, let's consider the first round of reasoning. If all players choose a number between 0 and 100, the average x will be around 50 (assuming a uniform distribution). Therefore, the target number to win the game in the first round would be (2/3)(50) = 100/3 ≈ 33.33.\n\nIn the second round of reasoning, players will adjust their choices based on the first round's target number. They will now choose a number between 0 and 33.33, making the new average x around 16.67 (assuming a uniform distribution). The new target number to win the game would be (2/3)(16.67) ≈ 11.11.\n\nThis process will continue iteratively, with players adjusting their choices based on the previous round's target number. As the number of rounds increases, the target number will approach 0.\n\nHowever, since there are only 100 players and they are not perfectly rational, we cannot assume that the target number will be exactly 0. Instead, we can estimate the optimal number to choose by considering the trend of the target numbers in the iterative process.\n\nIn general, the target number in each round can be expressed as (2/3)^n times the initial average (50), where n is the number of rounds. As n increases, the target number approaches 0. For practical purposes, we can choose a number close to the target number after a few rounds of reasoning.\n\nFor example, after 3 rounds of reasoning, the target number would be (2/3)^3 * 50 ≈ 12.35. So, choosing a number close to 12.35 would be a reasonable strategy to maximize your chances of winning the game."
