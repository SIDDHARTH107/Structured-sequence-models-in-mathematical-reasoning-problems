    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curve y = 2x² - 3x + 4 and the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 2, we need to integrate the function with respect to x over the given interval.\n\nThe area A can be found using the definite integral:\n\nA = ∫[0, 2] (2x² - 3x + 4) dx\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we first find the antiderivative of the function:\n\n∫(2x² - 3x + 4) dx = (2/3)x³ - (3/2)x² + 4x + C\n\nNow, we can find the area by evaluating the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\nA = [(2/3)(2)³ - (3/2)(2)² + 4(2)] - [(2/3)(0)³ - (3/2)(0)² + 4(0)]\n\nA = [(2/3)(8) - (3/2)(4) + 8] - [0]\n\nA = [(16/3) - 6 + 8]\n\nA = [16/3 - 18/3 + 24/3]\n\nA = [22/3]\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curve y = 2x² - 3x + 4 and the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 2 is 22/3 square units."
