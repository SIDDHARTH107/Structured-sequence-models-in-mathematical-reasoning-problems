    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. To make one unit of Product A, it takes 3 hours of assembly time and 2 hours of packaging time. To make one unit of Product B, it takes 4 hours of assembly time and 3 hours of packaging time. The factory has a total of 180 assembly hours and 120 packaging hours available per week. If the profit per unit of Product A is $100 and for Product B is $150, how many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize profit?",

Therefore, the factory should produce 60 units of Product A and 15 units of Product B to maximize profit."
