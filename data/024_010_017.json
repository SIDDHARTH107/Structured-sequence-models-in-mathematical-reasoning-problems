    "message_1": "Consider the following metric: \n\n$$ds^2 = 4(dx^2 + dy^2) + 9dz^2$$ \n\nFind the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric at $P(1,1,1)$.\\\n\n(Note: you may also specify the coordinate system in which the metric is written)",
    "message_2": "The given metric can be written in matrix form as:\n\n$$g = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection is given by the Christoffel symbols, which can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{lj} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$$\n\nwhere $g^{kl}$ is the inverse of the metric tensor $g_{kl}$. In this case, the inverse metric tensor is:\n\n$$g^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/9 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric tensor is diagonal and constant, its derivatives with respect to the coordinates are all zero:\n\n$$\\partial_i g_{lj} = \\partial_j g_{il} = \\partial_l g_{ij} = 0$$\n\nThus, the Christoffel symbols are all zero:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$$\n\nSo, the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric at any point, including $P(1,1,1)$, is zero. This means that the given metric is flat, and the coordinate system is Cartesian coordinates."
