    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to chemical reaction kinetics and rate equations:\n\nThe rate of the reaction between acetone and iodine in the presence of an acid catalyst is given by the following differential equation: \n\ndy/dt = k(4 - y)(6 - y)\n\nwhere y represents the concentration of iodine at time t, k is the rate constant and is equal to 0.05 min^-1.\n\nIf the initial concentration of iodine is 3M, what is the concentration after 10 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation and then use the initial condition and the given time to find the concentration of iodine after 10 minutes.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ndy/dt = k(4 - y)(6 - y)\n\nLet's separate the variables:\n\ndy/((4 - y)(6 - y)) = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫ dy/((4 - y)(6 - y)) = ∫ k dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let:\n\nA/(4 - y) + B/(6 - y) = 1/((4 - y)(6 - y))\n\nMultiplying both sides by (4 - y)(6 - y) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\nA(6 - y) + B(4 - y) = 1\n\nExpanding and collecting like terms, we have:\n\n(-A - B)y + 6A + 4B = 1\n\nNow we can solve for A and B by setting up a system of linear equations:\n\n- A - B = 0\n6A + 4B = 1\n\nSolving this system, we find that A = 1/2 and B = -1/2. So, our partial fraction decomposition is:\n\n1/((4 - y)(6 - y)) = (1/2)/(4 - y) - (1/2)/(6 - y)\n\nNow we can integrate both sides:\n\n∫ (1/2)/(4 - y) dy - ∫ (1/2)/(6 - y) dy = ∫ k dt\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n(-1/2)ln|4 - y| + (1/2)ln|6 - y| = kt + C\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition y(0) = 3 to find the constant C:\n\n(-1/2)ln|4 - 3| + (1/2)ln|6 - 3| = 0.05(0) + C\n\n(1/2)ln|3| = C\n\nC = (1/2)ln(3)\n\nNow we have the equation for y(t):\n\n(-1/2)ln|4 - y| + (1/2)ln|6 - y| = kt + (1/2)ln(3)\n\nWe need to find the concentration of iodine after 10 minutes, so we'll plug in t = 10:\n\n(-1/2)ln|4 - y| + (1/2)ln|6 - y| = 0.05(10) + (1/2)ln(3)\n\nNow, we need to solve for y:\n\n(-1/2)ln|4 - y| + (1/2)ln|6 - y| = 0.5 + (1/2)ln(3)\n\nLet's denote ln|4 - y| as u and ln|6 - y| as v. Then, we have:\n\n(-1/2)u + (1/2)v = 0.5 + (1/2)ln(3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite u and v in terms of exponentials:\n\n4 - y = e^u\n6 - y = e^v\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 4 - e^u\ny = 6 - e^v\n\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first:\n\n4 - e^u = 6 - e^v\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\ne^v - e^u = 2\n\nNow, we can substitute u and v back in terms of y:\n\ne^(ln|6 - y|) - e^(ln|4 - y|) = 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n|6 - y| - |4 - y| = 2\n\nSince we know that the concentration of iodine is decreasing over time, we can assume that y > 4, so we can remove the absolute value signs:\n\n6 - y - (y - 4) = 2\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\n6 - y - y + 4 = 2\n\n-2y = -8\n\ny = 4\n\nSo, the concentration of iodine after 10 minutes is 4M."
