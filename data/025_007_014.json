Let $L$ be a line bundle on $C$ of degree $d$. \n\nLet $H^0(C,L)$ be the space of global sections of $L$ and let $h^0(C,L)$ be the dimension of this space. Let $H^1(C,L)$ be the first cohomology group of $L$ and let $h^1(C,L)$ be its dimension. \n\nIf $h^0(C,L) = d+1$, show that:\n$$h^1(C,L) = g - d.$$",
    "message_2": "To show that $h^1(C, L) = g - d$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any line bundle $L$ on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$$h^0(C, L) - h^1(C, L) = d - g + 1$$\n\nWe are given that $h^0(C, L) = d + 1$. We want to find $h^1(C, L)$. Plugging the given value of $h^0(C, L)$ into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\n$$(d + 1) - h^1(C, L) = d - g + 1$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $h^1(C, L)$:\n\n$$h^1(C, L) = (d + 1) - (d - g + 1)$$\n$$h^1(C, L) = g - d$$\n\nThus, we have shown that if $h^0(C, L) = d + 1$, then $h^1(C, L) = g - d$."
