    "message_1": "A ciphertext has been encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The frequency analysis of the ciphertext shows that the most common letter is \"X\" which appears 121 times, while the least common letter is \"Q\" which appears only 4 times. Calculate the frequency percentage of each letter in the ciphertext rounded to 2 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency percentage of each letter, we need to know the total number of letters in the ciphertext. Unfortunately, the information provided is not sufficient to determine the total number of letters. Please provide the total number of letters in the ciphertext or the frequency of other letters to help calculate the frequency percentage."
