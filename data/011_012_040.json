    "message_1": "Consider a group of 30 students. Among them, 18 students like ice cream, 12 students like cake, and 8 students like both ice cream and cake. How many of these 30 students do not like ice cream or cake? Apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "The inclusion-exclusion principle states that for two sets A and B, the total number of elements in A and B is equal to the sum of the number of elements in each set minus the number of elements in their intersection.\n\nLet A be the set of students who like ice cream and B be the set of students who like cake.\n\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- |A| = 18 (students who like ice cream)\n- |B| = 12 (students who like cake)\n- |A ∩ B| = 8 (students who like both ice cream and cake)\n\nNow, we can find the total number of students who like either ice cream or cake:\n\n|A ∪ B| = 18 + 12 - 8 = 22\n\nSince there are 30 students in total, the number of students who do not like ice cream or cake is:\n\n30 - 22 = 8\n\nSo, 8 students do not like ice cream or cake."
