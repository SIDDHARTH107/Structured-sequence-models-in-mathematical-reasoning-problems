    "message_1": "One possible math problem relating to causal logic could be:\n\nA study found that the average number of hours of study per week is a strong predictor of final exam scores, with an estimated causal effect of 0.8 points increase in the final exam score for each additional hour of study. If a student studies for 10 hours per week, what is their predicted final exam score based on this causal model?\n\nAnswer: The estimated causal effect is 0.8, so for 10 hours of study, the predicted increase in final exam score is 0.8 x 10 = 8 points. If the student's baseline level of exam performance is 70, then their predicted final exam score would be 70 + 8 = 78.",
