    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 3, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 2\n\nNow, we will use Newton's Method to find the critical points. Newton's Method is an iterative method that can be used to find the roots of a function. The formula for Newton's Method is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the current approximation and x_n+1 is the next approximation.\n\nFirst, find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 10\n\nNow, choose an initial guess for the critical point within the interval [0, 5]. Let's choose x_0 = 2.\n\nApply Newton's Method:\n\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0)\nx_1 = 2 - (3(2)^2 - 10(2) + 2) / (6(2) - 10)\nx_1 = 2 - (12 - 20 + 2) / (12 - 10)\nx_1 = 2 - (-6) / 2\nx_1 = 2 + 3\nx_1 = 5\n\nSince x_1 is at the boundary of our interval, we should check the value of the function at both endpoints of the interval and at x_1:\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 5(0)^2 + 2(0) + 3 = 3\nf(5) = 5^3 - 5(5)^2 + 2(5) + 3 = 125 - 125 + 10 + 3 = 13\nf(2) = 2^3 - 5(2)^2 + 2(2) + 3 = 8 - 20 + 4 + 3 = -5\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) within the interval [0, 5] occurs at x = 2, and the minimum value is f(2) = -5.00."
