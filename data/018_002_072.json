    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of both set A and set B, we need to show that every element in the intersection of A and B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nLet's first find the intersection of set A and set B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nFrom the given sets, we can see that the common elements are 2 and 4. Therefore,\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nLet x be an element of A ∩ B. Then x is either 2 or 4.\n\nCase 1: x = 2\nSince 2 is an element of A and 2 is an element of B, x is an element of both A and B.\n\nCase 2: x = 4\nSince 4 is an element of A and 4 is an element of B, x is an element of both A and B.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that x, an element of A ∩ B, is also an element of A and an element of B. Therefore, the intersection of set A and set B, A ∩ B, is a subset of both set A and set B."
