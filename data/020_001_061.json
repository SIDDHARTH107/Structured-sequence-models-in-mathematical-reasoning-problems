    "message_1": "A juice company produces two types of juices: orange and apple. The cost of producing per liter of orange juice is 50 cents, and the cost of producing apple juice is 70 cents. The company has a budget of $150 to produce the juice. They have to sell at least 300 liters of juice to break even. The company wants to maximize their profit. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the juice company can make? How much of each type of juice should they produce to achieve this maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of liters of orange juice and y be the number of liters of apple juice. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. The cost of producing the juices should not exceed the budget: 0.5x + 0.7y ≤ 150\n2. The company has to sell at least 300 liters of juice: x + y ≥ 300\n\nTo maximize profit, the company should produce more of the cheaper juice (orange juice) while still meeting the constraints. We can rewrite the first constraint as:\n\ny ≤ (150 - 0.5x) / 0.7\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies both constraints. Since x + y ≥ 300, we can rewrite the second constraint as:\n\ny ≥ 300 - x\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of these two inequalities:\n\n(150 - 0.5x) / 0.7 ≥ 300 - x\n\nSolving for x:\n\n150 - 0.5x ≥ 210 - 0.7x\n0.2x ≥ 60\nx ≥ 300\n\nSince x must be an integer, the maximum value of x is 300. This means the company should produce 300 liters of orange juice. Now, we can find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny ≥ 300 - x\ny ≥ 0\n\nSo, the company should produce 0 liters of apple juice.\n\nThe maximum profit can be calculated by finding the revenue and subtracting the production cost. Assuming the company sells all the juice they produce, the revenue will be the same for both types of juice. Let's denote the selling price per liter as P. Then, the revenue will be:\n\nRevenue = 300P\n\nThe production cost for 300 liters of orange juice is:\n\nCost = 0.5 * 300 = 150\n\nThe profit is:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = 300P - 150\n\nSince the company wants to maximize their profit, they should set the selling price P as high as possible while still being able to sell all the juice. However, without information on the demand for the juice or the maximum price customers are willing to pay, we cannot determine the exact maximum profit."
