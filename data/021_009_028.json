    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5 using the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x. This will give us the gradient or slope of the function at any point x.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the minimum value of the function. We start with an initial guess for x, and then iteratively update the value of x using the following formula:\n\nx_new = x_old - learning_rate * f'(x_old)\n\nThe learning_rate is a positive constant that determines the step size of each update. We continue updating x until the change in x becomes very small or reaches a certain number of iterations.\n\nLet's choose an initial guess x = 0 and a learning_rate = 0.01. We will update x for 1000 iterations.\n\nAfter 1000 iterations, we get x ≈ -1.5. Now, we can plug this value of x back into the original function f(x) to find the minimum value:\n\nf(-1.5) = (-1.5)^2 + 3(-1.5) + 5 ≈ 1.75\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5 using the gradient descent method is approximately 1.75."
