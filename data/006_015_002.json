    "message_2": "To find the probability of no DDoS attacks occurring in a 10-hour period, we first need to find the probability of a DDoS attack not occurring in a single hour. \n\nThe probability of a DDoS attack not occurring in a single hour is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of this happening for 10 consecutive hours. Since each hour is independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.8^10 = 0.1073741824\n\nSo, the probability of no DDoS attacks occurring in a 10-hour period is approximately 0.1074 or 10.74%."
