If the order of the subgroup generated by `P` is `n = 7` and the order of the subgroup generated by `Q` is `m = 11`, find the coordinates of the point `R = P + Q`.",
    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the point R = P + Q, we need to use the addition formula for elliptic curves. Since P and Q are distinct points, the formula for the sum R = (x_r, y_r) is given by:\n\n1. λ = (y_q - y_p) / (x_q - x_p)\n2. x_r = λ² - x_p - x_q\n3. y_r = λ(x_p - x_r) - y_p\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of λ:\n\nλ = (y_q - y_p) / (x_q - x_p) = (2 - 5) / (1 - 2) = (-3) / (-1) = 3\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of R:\n\nx_r = λ² - x_p - x_q = 3² - 2 - 1 = 9 - 2 - 1 = 6\ny_r = λ(x_p - x_r) - y_p = 3(2 - 6) - 5 = 3(-4) - 5 = -12 - 5 = -17\n\nHowever, since we are working with an elliptic curve, we need to take the negative of y_r as the final y-coordinate:\n\ny_r = -(-17) = 17\n\nSo, the coordinates of the point R = P + Q are (6, 17)."
