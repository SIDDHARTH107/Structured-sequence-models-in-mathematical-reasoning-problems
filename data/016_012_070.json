    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, meaning that it can fill a square completely. The construction process involves dividing the square into smaller squares and connecting them with a continuous curve. Each iteration increases the length of the curve.\n\nLet's denote the length of the curve after n iterations as L_n. After the first iteration, the curve is divided into 9 equal segments, and the length of the curve is 9 times the length of the initial square, so L_1 = 9.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by 9, because each segment is divided into 9 smaller segments. Therefore, the length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated as:\n\nL_n = 9^n\n\nTo find the total length of the Peano curve after 6 iterations, we can plug in n = 6:\n\nL_6 = 9^6 = 531441\n\nSo, the total length of the Peano curve after 6 iterations is 531,441 times the length of the initial square. Since the initial square has a length of 1, the total length of the Peano curve after 6 iterations is 531,441."
