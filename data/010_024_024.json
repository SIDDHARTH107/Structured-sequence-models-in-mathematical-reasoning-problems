    "message_2": "To find the area of a hyperbolic triangle, we can use the Lobachevsky formula:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle. However, we are given the side lengths, not the angles. To find the angles, we can use the hyperbolic cosine law:\n\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) + sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(γ)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find the angle γ:\n\ncos(γ) = (cosh(c) - cosh(a) * cosh(b)) / (sinh(a) * sinh(b))\n\nPlugging in the given side lengths:\n\ncos(γ) = (cosh(5) - cosh(3) * cosh(4)) / (sinh(3) * sinh(4))\n\nNow, we can find the angles α and β using the same formula:\n\ncos(α) = (cosh(3) - cosh(4) * cosh(5)) / (sinh(4) * sinh(5))\ncos(β) = (cosh(4) - cosh(5) * cosh(3)) / (sinh(5) * sinh(3))\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse cosine (arccos) of each of these values to get the angles in radians:\n\nα = arccos(cos(α))\nβ = arccos(cos(β))\nγ = arccos(cos(γ))\n\nFinally, we can plug these angles into the Lobachevsky formula to find the area:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nPlease note that the calculations above involve hyperbolic trigonometric functions, which might not be easily solvable by hand. You can use a calculator or a software like Wolfram Alpha to compute the numerical values for the angles and the area."
