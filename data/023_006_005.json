For the first term: 3πδ(ω - 4)\nf1(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫ 3πδ(ω - 4) * e^(iωt) dω\nUsing the property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\nf1(t) = 3 * e^(i(4)t)\n\n2. For the second term: -4iδ(ω + 5)\nf2(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫ -4iδ(ω + 5) * e^(iωt) dω\nUsing the property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\nf2(t) = -4i * e^(-i(5)t)\n\n3. For the third term: π/2δ(ω)\nf3(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫ (π/2)δ(ω) * e^(iωt) dω\nUsing the property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\nf3(t) = (π/2)\n\nNow, we can add all three terms together to get the final solution:\n\nf(t) = f1(t) + f2(t) + f3(t)\nf(t) = 3 * e^(i(4)t) - 4i * e^(-i(5)t) + (π/2)"
