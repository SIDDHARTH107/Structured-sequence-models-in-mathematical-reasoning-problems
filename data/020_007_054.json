There are 5 available trucks of different maximum capacities: Truck 1 can carry up to 200 packages, Truck 2 can carry up to 250 packages, Truck 3 can carry up to 150 packages, Truck 4 can carry up to 300 packages and Truck 5 can carry up to 100 packages. Determine the minimum number of trucks required to transport all the packages from the first warehouse to the second one.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of trucks needed, we should use the trucks with the highest capacity first. \n\nFirst, we use Truck 4, which can carry 300 packages. After this, we have 1000 - 300 = 700 packages remaining.\n\nNext, we use Truck 2, which can carry 250 packages. After this, we have 700 - 250 = 450 packages remaining.\n\nNow, we use Truck 1, which can carry 200 packages. After this, we have 450 - 200 = 250 packages remaining.\n\nFinally, we use Truck 2 again, which can carry another 250 packages. After this, we have 250 - 250 = 0 packages remaining.\n\nSo, the minimum number of trucks required to transport all the packages is 4 (Truck 4, Truck 2, Truck 1, and Truck 2 again)."
