    "message_1": "A company produces a popular brand of smartphones and earns a profit of $150 for every unit sold. There is only one other company producing smartphones, and they have the same product as the first company. If both companies choose to set the same price, they will split the market equally. However, if one company lowers their price by $10, they will capture the entire market. What price should each company set to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the price set by both companies as P. If both companies set the same price, they will split the market equally. The profit per unit for each company is $150, so the total profit for each company will be:\n\nProfit = (Market Share) * (Profit per Unit)\n\nIf one company lowers their price by $10, they will capture the entire market, but their profit per unit will decrease to $140 (since they reduced the price by $10). In this case, the total profit for the company that lowers their price will be:\n\nProfit = (Market Share) * (New Profit per Unit)\n\nTo maximize their profits, each company should compare the profit they would make by keeping the price the same and splitting the market, versus lowering the price and capturing the entire market.\n\nCase 1: Both companies set the same price (P)\nProfit = (1/2) * (Market Size) * $150\n\nCase 2: One company lowers their price by $10\nProfit = (Market Size) * $140\n\nNow, we need to find the price (P) that makes the profit in both cases equal:\n\n(1/2) * (Market Size) * $150 = (Market Size) * $140\n\nDivide both sides by (Market Size):\n\n(1/2) * $150 = $140\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n$150 = $280\n\nSubtract $150 from both sides:\n\nP = $130\n\nSo, to maximize their profits, each company should set their price at $130. If one company lowers their price to $120, they will capture the entire market, but their profit per unit will decrease to $140, which would result in a lower total profit than if they kept the price at $130 and split the market equally."
