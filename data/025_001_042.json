    "message_2": "To apply Bezout's theorem, we first need to find the degrees of the given algebraic curves.\n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 - 4 = 0 is a circle with degree 2 (since the highest power of x or y is 2).\n\nC2: x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 2y - 1 = 0 can be rewritten as (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 - 3 = 0, which is also a circle with degree 2.\n\nBezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nSince both C1 and C2 are circles with degree 2 and have no common components, the number of intersection points is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, according to Bezout's theorem, there are 4 points of intersection between C1 and C2."
