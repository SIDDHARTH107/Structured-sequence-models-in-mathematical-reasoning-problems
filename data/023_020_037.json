    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = x + π for -π < x < π, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * ∫[-π, π] (x + π) dx\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * [(1/2)x^2 + πx] evaluated from -π to π\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * [(1/2)(π^2) + π^2 - (1/2)(-π^2) - π^2]\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * [π^2]\n\na_0 = π / 2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] (x + π) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nSince the function (x + π) * cos(n * x) is odd, the integral over the symmetric interval [-π, π] will be zero:\n\na_n = 0\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] (x + π) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[-π, π] π * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nFor the first part, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\n∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx = [-x * (1/n) * cos(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π - ∫[-π, π] (-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nThe first term is zero because cos(n * π) = cos(-n * π) = (-1)^n, and the second term is also zero because cos(n * x) is an even function and the integral is over a symmetric interval.\n\nNow for the second part:\n\n∫[-π, π] π * sin(n * x) dx = π * [-1/n * cos(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [π * (1/n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(-n * π))]\n\nb_n = (1 / n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(-n * π))\n\nSince cos(x) is an even function, cos(n * π) = cos(-n * π), and therefore:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x + π for -π < x < π is:\n\nf(x) = π / 2\n\nHowever, this result seems incorrect given the original function. The problem is that the function f(x) = x + π is not periodic over the interval -π < x < π. To make it periodic, we can define a new function g(x) = f(x) - π/2, which is an odd function:\n\ng(x) = x - π / 2\n\nNow, the Fourier series of g(x) will only have sine terms:\n\ng(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nWe can find the b_n coefficients for g(x):\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] (x - π / 2) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx - ∫[-π, π] (π / 2) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nAs we calculated before, the first integral is zero. For the second integral:\n\n∫[-π, π] (π / 2) * sin(n * x) dx = (π / 2) * [-1/n * cos(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [π * (1/n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(-n * π))]\n\nb_n = (1 / n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(-n * π))\n\nb_n = (2 / n) * (-1)^n * sin(n * π / 2)\n\nSo, the Fourier series of g(x) = x - π / 2 is:\n\ng(x) = Σ [(2 / n) * (-1)^n * sin(n * π / 2) * sin(n * x)]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series of the original function f(x) by adding π / 2 to g(x):\n\nf(x) = π / 2 + Σ [(2 / n) * (-1)^n * sin(n * π / 2) * sin(n * x)]"
