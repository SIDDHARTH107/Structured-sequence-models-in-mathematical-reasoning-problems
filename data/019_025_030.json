    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve on the topic of causal logic:\n\nSuppose that a case-control study is conducted to investigate the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. In the study, 30 cases of lung cancer and 30 controls without lung cancer are included. Among the cases, 25 are smokers, while among the controls, only 10 are smokers. Calculate the odds ratio for the association between smoking and lung cancer in this study.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the odds ratio, we need to create a 2x2 contingency table with the given data:\n\n```\n                      Lung Cancer    No Lung Cancer\nSmokers                   25               10\nNon-Smokers                5               20\n```\n\nNow, we can calculate the odds ratio using the formula:\n\nOdds Ratio = (Odds of lung cancer in smokers) / (Odds of lung cancer in non-smokers)\n\nOdds of lung cancer in smokers = (25 / 10)\nOdds of lung cancer in non-smokers = (5 / 20)\n\nOdds Ratio = (25 / 10) / (5 / 20) = (25 * 20) / (10 * 5) = 500 / 50 = 10\n\nSo, the odds ratio for the association between smoking and lung cancer in this study is 10. This means that smokers are 10 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to non-smokers."
