    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,4), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by the position vector r(u,v) = (u, v, 6 - u^2 - v^2). Then, we can find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, -2u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nruu = d^2r/du^2 = (0, 0, -2)\nruv = d^2r/dudv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = d^2r/dv^2 = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form matrix (E, F, G) and the second fundamental form matrix (L, M, N):\n\nE = ru • ru = 1 + 4u^2\nF = ru • rv = -2uv\nG = rv • rv = 1 + 4v^2\n\nL = ruu • n = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = ruv • n = 0\nN = rvv • n = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/2) * ((EN - 2FM + GL) / (EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1,1,4), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 5, F = -2, G = 5\nL = -1/sqrt(9), M = 0, N = -1/sqrt(9)\n\nH = (1/2) * ((-1/9 + 0 + (-1/9)) / (25 - 4))\nH = (1/2) * ((-2/9) / 21)\nH = -1/21\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,4) is -1/21."
