    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe given equation is y = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x + 1.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x + 1)/dx\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 4x + 4\n\nNow, let's evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 3(2)^2 - 4(2) + 4\ndy/dx(2) = 3(4) - 8 + 4\ndy/dx(2) = 12 - 8 + 4\ndy/dx(2) = 8\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 8."
