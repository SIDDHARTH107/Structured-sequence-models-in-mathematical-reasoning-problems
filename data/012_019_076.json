    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color its edges, meaning that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 7 vertices and 11 edges. We can use Vizing's theorem to find the chromatic index. Vizing's theorem states that for any simple, undirected graph G, the chromatic index χ'(G) is either the maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph. Since there are 11 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 11 = 22. The maximum possible degree for a vertex in a simple graph with 7 vertices is 6 (it can be connected to all other vertices). Let's assume there is at least one vertex with degree 6. Then, the sum of the degrees of the remaining 6 vertices is 22 - 6 = 16. The maximum degree for the remaining vertices is 5 (they can be connected to all other vertices except the one with degree 6). However, 6 vertices with degree 5 would result in a sum of 30, which is greater than 16. Therefore, there can't be a vertex with degree 6 in the graph.\n\nNow, let's assume there is at least one vertex with degree 5. Then, the sum of the degrees of the remaining 6 vertices is 22 - 5 = 17. The maximum degree for the remaining vertices is 4 (they can be connected to all other vertices except the one with degree 5). We can distribute the remaining 17 degrees among the 6 vertices as follows: 4, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1. This distribution is valid, so the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph is 5.\n\nNow, we can apply Vizing's theorem. The chromatic index χ'(G) is either Δ(G) = 5 or Δ(G) + 1 = 6. To determine which value is correct, we need to check if it's possible to properly color the edges of the graph with 5 colors. If it's not possible, then the chromatic index is 6.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot definitively determine if it's possible to color the edges with 5 colors. Therefore, the chromatic index χ'(G) of the graph G is either 5 or 6."
