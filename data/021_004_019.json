Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nUsing the forward difference method, estimate the derivative of the function f(x) = sin(x) at x = 1 with a step size of 0.1. Also, calculate the error in the estimation compared to the true derivative value at x = 1.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the derivative of f(x) = sin(x) at x = 1 using the forward difference method with a step size of 0.1, we can use the following formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere f'(x) is the estimated derivative, f(x) is the function value at x, h is the step size (0.1 in this case), and x = 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (sin(1 + 0.1) - sin(1)) / 0.1\n\nNow, we can calculate the values:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (sin(1.1) - sin(1)) / 0.1 ≈ (0.8912 - 0.8415) / 0.1 ≈ 0.497\n\nNow, let's calculate the true derivative value at x = 1. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), so the true derivative value at x = 1 is:\n\nf'(1) = cos(1) ≈ 0.5403\n\nNow, we can calculate the error in the estimation:\n\nError = |True derivative - Estimated derivative| = |0.5403 - 0.497| ≈ 0.0433\n\nSo, the error in the estimation compared to the true derivative value at x = 1 is approximately 0.0433."
