    "message_2": "Cholesky decomposition is not the most suitable method for solving this system of linear equations, as it requires a symmetric positive definite matrix. Instead, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve this system.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n|  3  6 -2 | 15\n|  6 18 -4 | 36\n| -2 -4  5 | 10\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  2 -2/3 |  5\n|  6 18 -4   | 36\n| -2 -4  5   | 10\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element of the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 6 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 + 2 * Row1\n\n|  1  2 -2/3 |  5\n|  0  6  0   |  6\n|  0  0  4   | 20\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 6 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  2 -2/3 |  5\n|  0  1  0   |  1\n|  0  0  4   | 20\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element of the first and third rows:\n\nRow1 = Row1 - 2 * Row2\nRow3 = Row3\n\n|  1  0  -2/3 |  3\n|  0  1   0   |  1\n|  0  0   4   | 20\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 4 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  0  -2/3 |  3\n|  0  1   0   |  1\n|  0  0   1   |  5\n\nStep 6: Eliminate the third element of the first and second rows:\n\nRow1 = Row1 + 2/3 * Row3\nRow2 = Row2\n\n|  1  0   0   |  5\n|  0  1   0   |  1\n|  0  0   1   |  5\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = 5\ny = 1\nz = 5"
