    "message_1": "A company claims that the average lifespan of its light bulbs is 1000 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. A sample of 36 bulbs is selected and their average lifespan is found to be 980 hours. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of the bulbs?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of the bulbs, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± Z * (σ / √n)\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95%), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nGiven:\nx̄ = 980 hours\nσ = 50 hours\nn = 36 bulbs\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval. For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 980 ± 1.96 * (50 / √36)\nCI = 980 ± 1.96 * (50 / 6)\nCI = 980 ± 1.96 * 8.333\nCI = 980 ± 16.333\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of the bulbs is (963.67, 996.33) hours."
