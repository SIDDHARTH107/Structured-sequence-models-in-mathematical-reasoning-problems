    "message_1": "If you have a deck of 52 cards and draw one card at random, what is the probability that you draw a heart?",
    "message_2": "There are 13 hearts in a standard deck of 52 cards (Ace through King of hearts). To find the probability of drawing a heart, you can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (drawing a heart), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (total cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a heart is:\n\nProbability = 13/52 = 1/4 or 0.25\n\nThere is a 0.25 or 25% chance of drawing a heart from a standard deck of 52 cards."
