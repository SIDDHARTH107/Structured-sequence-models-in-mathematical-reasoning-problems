    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two products: product A and product B. Each product requires a certain number of labor hours and machine hours. Product A requires 3 labor hours and 2 machine hours, while product B requires 2 labor hours and 4 machine hours. The company has a total of 100 labor hours and 80 machine hours. The profit per unit of product A is $50 and the profit per unit of product B is $30. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can earn if it produces a combination of product A and product B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for labor hours and machine hours can be written as:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 100 (labor hours)\n2x + 4y ≤ 80 (machine hours)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\ny ≤ (100 - 3x) / 2\ny ≤ (80 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\ny ≤ (100 - 3x) / 2\ny ≤ (80 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 20), (20, 10), and (33.33, 0). We'll evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 30(0) = $0\nP(0, 20) = 50(0) + 30(20) = $600\nP(20, 10) = 50(20) + 30(10) = $1300\nP(33.33, 0) = 50(33.33) + 30(0) = $1666.50\n\nThe maximum profit is $1666.50 when the company produces 33.33 units of product A and 0 units of product B. Since the company cannot produce a fraction of a product, they should produce 33 units of product A and 1 unit of product B, which will result in a profit of $1650."
