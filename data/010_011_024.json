    "message_2": "The manifold M = S^1 × S^1 is a torus, which is the Cartesian product of two circles. To determine the number of unique ways to orient M, we need to consider the orientations of each circle.\n\nEach circle S^1 has two possible orientations: clockwise and counterclockwise. Since there are two circles in the Cartesian product, we have a total of 2 × 2 = 4 possible orientations for M.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the orientation of the torus is determined by the orientation of both circles, and flipping the orientation of both circles at the same time results in the same orientation of the torus. Therefore, there are actually only 2 unique ways to orient the torus M = S^1 × S^1."
