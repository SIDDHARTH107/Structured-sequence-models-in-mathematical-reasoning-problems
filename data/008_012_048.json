    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  5 |\n    | 3  9 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    | 22 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (denoted as A^(-1)). To do this, we first calculate the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant(A) = (2 * 9) - (5 * 3) = 18 - 15 = 3\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we can find the inverse of A using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1 / Determinant(A)) * Adj(A)\n\nwhere Adj(A) is the adjugate of A. The adjugate of A is found by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdj(A) = |  9 -5 |\n         | -3  2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1 / 3) * |  9 -5 |\n                  | -3  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = |  3 -5/3 |\n         | -1  2/3 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  3 -5/3 | * | 11 |\n    | -1  2/3 |   | 22 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nX = | (3 * 11) + (-5/3 * 22) |\n    | (-1 * 11) + (2/3 * 22) |\n\nX = | 33 - 110/3 |\n    | -11 + 44/3 |\n\nX = | 33 - 36.67 |\n    | -11 + 14.67 |\n\nX = | -3.67 |\n    |  3.67 |\n\nSo, the approximate solution for the system of linear equations is x ≈ -3.67 and y ≈ 3.67."
