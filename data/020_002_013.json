    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, which generate a profit of $5 and $7 per unit respectively. Due to limited resources, the company can produce a maximum of 100 units per day. Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while product B requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The company has 300 labor hours and 180 machine hours available each day. How many of each product should the company produce in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 5x + 7y\n\nThe constraints are given by the limited resources:\n\n1. Total units constraint: x + y ≤ 100\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 300\n3. Machine constraint: x + 2y ≤ 180\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 100 => y = 100 - x\n2. 2x + 3y = 300 => y = (300 - 2x) / 3\n3. x + 2y = 180 => y = (180 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of constraints 1 and 2:\nx + y = 100\n2x + 3y = 300\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 60 and y = 40.\n\n2. Intersection of constraints 1 and 3:\nx + y = 100\nx + 2y = 180\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 60 and y = 40 (same as before).\n\n3. Intersection of constraints 2 and 3:\n2x + 3y = 300\nx + 2y = 180\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 20 and y = 80.\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 7y at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(60, 40) = 5(60) + 7(40) = 300 + 280 = 580\n2. P(20, 80) = 5(20) + 7(80) = 100 + 560 = 660\n\nSince the feasible region is a polygon, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices. Comparing the profit values, we see that the maximum profit of $660 per day is achieved when the company produces 20 units of product A and 80 units of product B."
