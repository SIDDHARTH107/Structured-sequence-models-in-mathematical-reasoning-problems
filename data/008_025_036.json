    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation, and multiply the first equation by -1 and add it to the third equation. This gives us:\n\nFirst equation: 2x + 3y - z = 5\n\nSecond equation: (4x - 2y + 3z) + 2(2x + 3y - z) = -8 + 2(5)\n8x + 4y = 2\n4x + 2y = 1\n\nThird equation: (-2x + y - 6z) - (2x + 3y - z) = 10 - 5\n-4x - 2y + 5z = 5\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n1) 2x + 3y - z = 5\n2) 4x + 2y = 1\n3) -4x - 2y + 5z = 5\n\nNext, we can eliminate x from the third equation by adding the second equation to it:\n\n(4x + 2y) + (-4x - 2y + 5z) = 1 + 5\n5z = 6\nz = 6/5\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for x and y:\n\n2x + 3y - (6/5) = 5\n2x + 3y = 5 + 6/5\n2x + 3y = 31/5\n\nWe can also substitute the value of z into the second equation:\n\n4x + 2y = 1\n4x + 2(3y - 2z) = 1\n4x + 6y - 4z = 1\n4x + 6y - 4(6/5) = 1\n4x + 6y = 1 + 24/5\n4x + 6y = 29/5\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n1) 2x + 3y = 31/5\n2) 4x + 6y = 29/5\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation to eliminate x:\n\n(4x + 6y) - 2(2x + 3y) = (29/5) - 2(31/5)\n4x + 6y - 4x - 6y = -3/5\n0 = -3/5\n\nSince we have reached a contradiction (0 â‰  -3/5), this system of equations has no solution."
