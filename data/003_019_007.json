    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of sin^2(x) from 0 to pi/2, we can use the power reduction formula:\n\nsin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2\n\nNow, we can integrate this expression with respect to x from 0 to pi/2:\n\n∫(1 - cos(2x))/2 dx from 0 to pi/2\n\nLet's break this integral into two parts:\n\n(1/2)∫(1)dx - (1/2)∫(cos(2x))dx from 0 to pi/2\n\nNow, we can integrate each part:\n\n(1/2)[x] from 0 to pi/2 - (1/2)[(1/2)sin(2x)] from 0 to pi/2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n(1/2)[(pi/2) - 0] - (1/4)[sin(pi) - sin(0)]\n\n(1/2)(pi/2) - (1/4)(0 - 0)\n\n(pi/4)\n\nSo, the definite integral of sin^2(x) from 0 to pi/2 is pi/4."
