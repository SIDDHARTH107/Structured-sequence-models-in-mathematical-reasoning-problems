    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference. The complement of a set is the set of elements that are not in the given set. To find the complement, we need to define a universal set U that contains all possible elements. Since A and B are subsets of U, we can define U as {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nThe complement of the symmetric difference is the set of elements in U that are not in A ∆ B:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of A and B is not distributive over complement. To do this, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B)' ≠ (A' ∆ B')\n\nFirst, let's find the complements of A and B:\n\nA' = {4}\nB' = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {2, 3} ≠ A' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is not distributive over complement."
