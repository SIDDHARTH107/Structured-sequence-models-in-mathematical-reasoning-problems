    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the number of hours of study and test scores, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / sqrt[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, x̄ is the mean of x values, and ȳ is the mean of y values.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the hours of study (x̄) and the mean of the test scores (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (4 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 5) / 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\nȳ = (82 + 90 + 70 + 93 + 85) / 5 = 420 / 5 = 84\n\nNow, let's calculate the individual terms (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) and their sum:\n\n(4 - 5)(82 - 84) = -1 * -2 = 2\n(6 - 5)(90 - 84) = 1 * 6 = 6\n(3 - 5)(70 - 84) = -2 * -14 = 28\n(7 - 5)(93 - 84) = 2 * 9 = 18\n(5 - 5)(85 - 84) = 0 * 1 = 0\n\nΣ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = 2 + 6 + 28 + 18 + 0 = 54\n\nNext, let's calculate the individual terms (xi - x̄)², (yi - ȳ)², and their sums:\n\n(xi - x̄)²: (-1)² = 1, (1)² = 1, (-2)² = 4, (2)² = 4, (0)² = 0\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 10\n\n(yi - ȳ)²: (-2)² = 4, (6)² = 36, (-14)² = 196, (9)² = 81, (1)² = 1\nΣ(yi - ȳ)² = 4 + 36 + 196 + 81 + 1 = 318\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = 54 / sqrt(10 * 318) = 54 / sqrt(3180) ≈ 54 / 56.4 ≈ 0.957\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours of study and test scores is approximately 0.957. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the two variables."
