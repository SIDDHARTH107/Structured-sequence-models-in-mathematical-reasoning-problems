    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[3 - λ, -1], [4, 2 - λ]]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\n|A - λI| = (3 - λ)(2 - λ) - (-1)(4) = λ^2 - 5λ + 10\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ + 10 = 0\n\nThis equation does not have rational roots. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nλ = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4(10))) / 2 = (5 ± √(25 - 40)) / 2 = (5 ± √(-15)) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + √(-15)) / 2 and λ2 = (5 - √(-15)) / 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ1 into the matrix A - λI:\n\n[[3 - (5 + √(-15)) / 2, -1], [4, 2 - (5 + √(-15)) / 2]]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n[[-(1 + √(-15)) / 2, -1], [4, -(1 + √(-15)) / 2]]\n\nNow, we solve the system of linear equations:\n\n-(1 + √(-15)) / 2 * x - y = 0\n4x - (1 + √(-15)) / 2 * y = 0\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 4 to eliminate x:\n\n(-2 - 2√(-15)) * x - 4y = 0\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(-3 - 2√(-15)) * y = 0\n\nSince we are looking for non-zero eigenvectors, y cannot be zero. Therefore, we can divide by (-3 - 2√(-15)):\n\ny = 1\n\nNow, substitute y back into the first equation:\n\n-(1 + √(-15)) / 2 * x - 1 = 0\n\nx = -2 / (1 + √(-15))\n\nSo, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 is:\n\nv1 = [-2 / (1 + √(-15)), 1]\n\nFor λ2:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ2 into the matrix A - λI:\n\n[[3 - (5 - √(-15)) / 2, -1], [4, 2 - (5 - √(-15)) / 2]]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n[[-(1 - √(-15)) / 2, -1], [4, -(1 - √(-15)) / 2]]\n\nNow, we solve the system of linear equations:\n\n-(1 - √(-15)) / 2 * x - y = 0\n4x - (1 - √(-15)) / 2 * y = 0\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 4 to eliminate x:\n\n(-2 + 2√(-15)) * x - 4y = 0\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(-3 + 2√(-15)) * y = 0\n\nSince we are looking for non-zero eigenvectors, y cannot be zero. Therefore, we can divide by (-3 + 2√(-15)):\n\ny = 1\n\nNow, substitute y back into the first equation:\n\n-(1 - √(-15)) / 2 * x - 1 = 0\n\nx = -2 / (1 - √(-15))\n\nSo, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 is:\n\nv2 = [-2 / (1 - √(-15)), 1]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + √(-15)) / 2 and λ2 = (5 - √(-15)) / 2, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [-2 / (1 + √(-15)), 1] and v2 = [-2 / (1 - √(-15)), 1]."
