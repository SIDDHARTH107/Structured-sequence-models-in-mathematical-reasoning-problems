    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) ∪ B and A ∪ B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∪ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nThe symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) ∪ B and A ∪ B is:\n\n((A ∆ B) ∪ B) ∆ (A ∪ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = {}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A ∪ B and B ∪ (A ∆ B):\n\nB ∪ (A ∆ B) = {3, 4, 5, 6} ∪ {1, 2, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nThe symmetric difference of A ∪ B and B ∪ (A ∆ B) is:\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ (B ∪ (A ∆ B)) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = {}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union.
