    "message_1": "Here is a problem related to Mori theory and its applications in Algebraic Geometry:\n\nLet X be a smooth, projective variety of dimension 3 with nef and big anti-ample divisor -K_X. Suppose that X admits a Mori's fiber space structure f: X → Z. Let B be an irreducible element of the stable base locus of f Kobayashi pseudoeffective of X. Prove that there exist a number N ≥ 0 and a morphism φ: X → Y to a smooth, projective variety Y of dimension 2 such that\n   -K_X ~ f^*(-K_Z) + φ^*(-K_Y) + N[E]  \nwhere E is an effective divisor on X contracted by f and [E] denotes its numerical equivalence class.",
    "message_2": "To prove the statement, we will use the Cone Theorem and the contraction theorem from Mori theory.\n\nSince -K_X is nef and big, by the Cone Theorem, there exists a contraction morphism f: X → Z such that -K_X is f-ample. By the contraction theorem, the fibers of f are connected and have dimension dim(X) - dim(Z) = 3 - dim(Z). Since X is a Mori fiber space, we have dim(Z) ≤ 2.\n\nNow, let B be an irreducible element of the stable base locus of f Kobayashi pseudoeffective of X. Since B is in the stable base locus, it is contracted by f. Thus, there exists an effective divisor E on X such that f(E) = B.\n\nWe claim that there exists a morphism φ: X → Y to a smooth, projective variety Y of dimension 2 such that -K_X ~ f^*(-K_Z) + φ^*(-K_Y) + N[E] for some N ≥ 0. To see this, consider the linear system |m(-K_X) - E| for some sufficiently large and divisible m > 0. This linear system defines a rational map φ_m: X ⇢ Y_m, where Y_m is a smooth, projective variety of dimension 2.\n\nBy taking the Stein factorization of φ_m, we obtain a factorization φ_m = φ' ◦ f', where f': X → Z' is a contraction morphism and φ': Z' → Y_m is a finite morphism. Since -K_X is f-ample, we have f^*(-K_Z) = -K_X - N[E] for some N ≥ 0. Moreover, since φ_m factors through f', we have φ^*(-K_Y) = f'^*(-K_{Z'}) = -K_X - f^*(-K_Z) - N[E].\n\nThus, we have -K_X ~ f^*(-K_Z) + φ^*(-K_Y) + N[E] as desired."
