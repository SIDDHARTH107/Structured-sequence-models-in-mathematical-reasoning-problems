    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3})\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ C:\n\n(A △ B) △ C = ({1, 4} △ {3, 4, 5}) = ({1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5})\n(A △ B) △ C = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C, denoted as B △ C:\n\nB △ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = ({2, 3, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({3, 4})\nB △ C = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find A △ (B △ C):\n\nA △ (B △ C) = ({1, 2, 3} △ {2, 5}) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 5}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 5})\nA △ (B △ C) = {1, 3, 5}\n\nWe can see that (A △ B) △ C = A △ (B △ C) = {1, 3, 5}.
