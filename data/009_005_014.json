    "message_2": "To find the current i(t) in the circuit, we need to use the impedance concept for the RLC series circuit. The impedance (Z) of the circuit is given by the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, XL is the inductive reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance. \n\nFirst, we need to find the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC).\n\nXL = 2 * π * f * L\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, L is the inductance, and C is the capacitance. \n\nGiven V(t) = 300sin(1000t), we can find the angular frequency (ω) and frequency (f) as follows:\n\nω = 1000 rad/s\nf = ω / (2 * π) = 1000 / (2 * π) ≈ 159.15 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate XL and XC:\n\nXL = 2 * π * 159.15 * 0.1 ≈ 100Ω\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * 159.15 * 2 * 10^-6) ≈ 500Ω\n\nNow, we can find the impedance (Z):\n\nZ = √(10^2 + (100 - 500)^2) = √(10^2 + (-400)^2) ≈ 400.25Ω\n\nNow, we can find the current i(t) using Ohm's Law:\n\ni(t) = V(t) / Z\n\ni(t) = (300sin(1000t)) / 400.25\n\ni(t) ≈ 0.75sin(1000t) A\n\nSo, the current i(t) in the circuit is approximately 0.75sin(1000t) Amperes."
