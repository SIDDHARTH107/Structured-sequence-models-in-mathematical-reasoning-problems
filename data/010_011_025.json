However, the Euler characteristic of a sphere and a torus is zero, while the Euler characteristic of a projective plane is 1. Therefore, the given manifold must be a projective plane. By the formula relating dimension, Euler characteristic, and homology groups, we have:\n\nchi(M) = sum((-1)^k * rank(H_k(M)), k=0 to n)\n\nwhere chi(M) is the Euler characteristic and n is the dimension of the manifold M. For a projective plane, we have chi(M) = 1 and rank(H_0(M)) = rank(H_2(M)) = 1, so the only non-trivial homology group is H_1(M), which must have rank 2. Thus, we have:\n\n1 = (-1)^0 * 1 + (-1)^1 * rank(H_1(M)) + (-1)^2 * 1\n\n1 = 1 - rank(H_1(M)) + 1\n\nrank(H_1(M)) = 1\n\nTherefore, the given manifold is a projective plane of dimension n=2.",
