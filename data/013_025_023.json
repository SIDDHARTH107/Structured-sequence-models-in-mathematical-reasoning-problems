    "message_1": "Consider two travelers who are trying to decide how much to declare as the value of their lost luggage to the airline. The travelers want to minimize their own loss, but they can only choose a whole number from 1 to 100. The airline will offer a reward to the traveler with the lowest declared value, but the reward will only be equal to the declared value minus a fixed penalty amount shared by both travelers. \n\nSuppose the fixed penalty is $20. What is the optimal strategy for each traveler? If both travelers use this strategy, what will be their declared values and the resulting reward for each traveler?",
    "message_2": "The optimal strategy for each traveler is to declare a value just below the other traveler's expected declaration, as this will maximize their reward. However, since both travelers are trying to minimize their own loss, they will both attempt to choose the lowest possible value.\n\nIn this case, the optimal strategy for both travelers is to declare a value of $21. This is because if either traveler declares a value lower than $21, their reward will be negative due to the fixed penalty of $20. If either traveler declares a value higher than $21, the other traveler can declare a value just below it and receive a higher reward.\n\nIf both travelers use this strategy and declare a value of $21, the airline will offer a reward equal to the declared value minus the fixed penalty, which is $21 - $20 = $1. Since both travelers declared the same value, they will both receive a reward of $1."
