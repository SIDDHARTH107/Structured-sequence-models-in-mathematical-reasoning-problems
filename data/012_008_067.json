    "message_2": "A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. According to Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn a planar graph, the maximum number of faces (F) can be determined by the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn this case, V = 6, so the inequality becomes:\n\nE ≤ 3(6) - 6\nE ≤ 18 - 6\nE ≤ 12\n\nHowever, this inequality is for a simple graph (no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices). Since we are considering a simple planar graph, we can further refine the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3(6 - 2)\nE ≤ 3(4)\nE ≤ 12\n\nThus, the maximum number of edges a planar graph with 6 vertices can have is 12."
