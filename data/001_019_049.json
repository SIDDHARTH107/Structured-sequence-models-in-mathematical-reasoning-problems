    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x-3| = 5, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 3 = 5\nIn this case, we simply solve for x:\n2x = 5 + 3\n2x = 8\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 2x - 3 = -5\nIn this case, we also solve for x:\n2x = -5 + 3\n2x = -2\nx = -1\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation |2x-3| = 5 are x = 4 and x = -1."
