    "message_2": "Proof when G is cyclic:\n\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. In other words, G = {g^0, g^1, ..., g^26}. Since the order of G is 27, the order of g must be 27 as well. \n\nNow, consider the cyclic group C27, which is generated by an element c with order 27. We can define a function φ: G → C27 such that φ(g^k) = c^k for all k in {0, 1, ..., 26}. \n\nWe will show that φ is an isomorphism:\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since g has order 27, g^k is distinct for all k in {0, 1, ..., 26}. Similarly, c^k is distinct for all k in {0, 1, ..., 26}. Thus, φ is well-defined.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let g^a, g^b be elements of G. Then, φ(g^a * g^b) = φ(g^(a+b)) = c^(a+b) = c^a * c^b = φ(g^a) * φ(g^b). Thus, φ is a homomorphism.\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(g^a) = φ(g^b) for some a, b in {0, 1, ..., 26}. Then, c^a = c^b, which implies a = b (since c has order 27). Thus, φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: For any element c^k in C27, there exists an element g^k in G such that φ(g^k) = c^k. Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined, injective, surjective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C27 when G is cyclic.\n\nProof when G is non-abelian:\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then G cannot be cyclic, as cyclic groups are always abelian. Since the order of G is 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G must divide 27 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, which we will denote by H. Since H is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal in G.\n\nNow, let g be an element in G that is not in H. Then, the order of g must be a divisor of 27, which means the order of g is either 1, 3, 9, or 27. Since g is not in H, the order of g cannot be 3. If the order of g is 27, then G would be cyclic, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, the order of g must be 9.\n\nConsider the subgroup K generated by g. Since the order of g is 9, the order of K is also 9. Moreover, K is not normal in G, as G is non-abelian. Now, consider the set G/H, which is the set of left cosets of H in G. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 27/9 = 3. Since G/H has order 3, it is cyclic and generated by the coset gH.\n\nNow, we can define a function φ: G → H × K by φ(x) = (x * g^(-n), g^n), where n is the unique integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 8 and x * g^(-n) is in H. We will show that φ is an isomorphism:\n\n1. φ is well-defined: For any x in G, there exists a unique n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 8 and x * g^(-n) is in H. Thus, φ is well-defined.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let x, y be elements of G. Then, φ(x * y) = (x * y * g^(-m), g^m), where m is the unique integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 8 and x * y * g^(-m) is in H. Let n, p be the unique integers such that x * g^(-n) and y * g^(-p) are in H, respectively. Then, φ(x) = (x * g^(-n), g^n) and φ(y) = (y * g^(-p), g^p). Since H and K are normal subgroups, we have (x * g^(-n)) * (y * g^(-p)) = x * y * g^(-n) * g^(-p) = x * y * g^(-m) * g^(-m) * g^m = x * y * g^(-m). Thus, φ(x * y) = φ(x) * φ(y), and φ is a homomorphism.\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(x) = φ(y) for some x, y in G. Then, x * g^(-n) = y * g^(-p) and g^n = g^p for some integers n, p. Since g has order 9, we have n = p, and thus x * g^(-n) = y * g^(-n). Multiplying both sides by g^n, we get x = y. Thus, φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: For any element (h, g^k) in H × K, there exists an element x in G such that x * g^(-k) = h. Then, φ(x) = (h, g^k), and φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined, injective, surjective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27 when G is non-abelian."
