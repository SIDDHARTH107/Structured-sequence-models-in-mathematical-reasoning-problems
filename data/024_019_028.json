    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total Gaussian curvature of a surface to its topological properties, specifically its Euler characteristic. For a hemisphere, the Euler characteristic (χ) is 1, since it is topologically equivalent to a disk.\n\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem states:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, dA is the area element, and S is the surface of the hemisphere.\n\nFor a hemisphere of radius r, the Gaussian curvature at any point is given by K = 1/r^2. In this case, the radius r is 5 centimeters. So, the Gaussian curvature K is:\n\nK = 1/(5^2) = 1/25 cm^(-2)\n\nNow we need to find the area of the hemisphere. The area of a hemisphere is given by:\n\nA = 2πr^2\n\nFor our hemisphere with radius 5 cm:\n\nA = 2π(5^2) = 50π cm^2\n\nNow we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nSince K is constant over the hemisphere, we can take it out of the integral:\n\n(1/25) ∫∫_S dA = 2πχ\n\nNow, we can replace the integral of dA with the area A:\n\n(1/25) * (50π) = 2πχ\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2π = 2πχ\n\nDivide both sides by 2π:\n\n1 = χ\n\nAs expected, the Euler characteristic of the hemisphere is 1. Now, we can find the total Gaussian curvature:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n∫∫_S (1/25) dA = 2π(1)\n\nTo solve for the integral, multiply both sides by 25:\n\n∫∫_S dA = 50π\n\nThe integral of dA over the surface S is equal to the area of the hemisphere, which we already calculated as 50π cm^2. Therefore, the total Gaussian curvature of the hemisphere is 50π cm^2."
