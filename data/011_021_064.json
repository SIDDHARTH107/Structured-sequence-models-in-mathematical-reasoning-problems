The distances between each city are as follows: \n\nA to B: 8 miles\nA to C: 12 miles\nA to D: 15 miles\nB to C: 7 miles\nB to D: 10 miles\nC to D: 6 miles\nB to E: 9 miles\nC to F: 11 miles\nD to F: 14 miles\nE to F: 7 miles\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance the salesman can travel to visit all 6 cities and return to the starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we need to determine the shortest path between each city in the specific order. Since the order is not given, I will assume the order is A-B-C-D-E-F and then back to A.\n\n1. A to B: 8 miles\n2. B to C: 7 miles\n3. C to D: 6 miles\n4. D to F: 14 miles\n5. F to E: 7 miles\n6. E to B: 9 miles (to complete the cycle and return to the starting point)\n\nNow, add up the distances:\n\n8 + 7 + 6 + 14 + 7 + 9 = 51 miles\n\nThe shortest possible distance the salesman can travel to visit all 6 cities in the given order and return to the starting point is 51 miles."
