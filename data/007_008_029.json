    "message_2": "We are given $a = 7$ and $p = 11$. Since 11 is a prime number and 7 is not divisible by 11, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n$$7^{11-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$7^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when $7^{102}$ is divided by 11. We can rewrite $7^{102}$ as $(7^{10})^{10} \\cdot 7^2$. Using the result from Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n$$(7^{10})^{10} \\cdot 7^2 \\equiv 1^{10} \\cdot 7^2 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$7^2 \\equiv 49 \\pmod{11}$$\n\nNow we just need to find the remainder when 49 is divided by 11:\n\n$$49 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$$\n\nSo, the remainder when $7^{102}$ is divided by 11 is 5."
