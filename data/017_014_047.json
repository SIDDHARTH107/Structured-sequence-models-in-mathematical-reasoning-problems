    "message_2": "To find the distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5^1. Let G be a group of order 20.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Therefore, there is a unique (up to isomorphism) normal 5-Sylow subgroup P_5 of G, which is isomorphic to C5 (the cyclic group of order 5).\n\nSimilarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique (up to isomorphism) normal 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of G, which is isomorphic to C4 (the cyclic group of order 4).\n\nNow we consider the possible structures of G:\n\n1. If both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G, then G is the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is isomorphic to C4 × C5 ≅ C20 (the cyclic group of order 20).\n\n2. If n_2 = 5, then there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups, and P_2 is not normal in G. In this case, we can use the semidirect product to construct a non-abelian group of order 20. Let α be a generator of P_5 and β be a generator of P_2. We can define a non-trivial action of P_5 on P_2 by conjugation: αβα^(-1) = β^(-1). This action defines a non-abelian semidirect product G = P_5 ⋊ P_2, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nThere are no other possibilities for the structure of G, so there are exactly three distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20: the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, and the non-abelian group of order 20 (which is also D10 in this case)."
