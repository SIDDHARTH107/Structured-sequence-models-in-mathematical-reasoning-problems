    "message_1": "Suppose that there is a system that continuously cycles between two states, A and B, with a cycle time of 10 seconds. Using temporal logic, determine if the system is currently in state A if it was in state B 25 seconds ago.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem using temporal logic. The system cycles between states A and B with a cycle time of 10 seconds. This means that every 10 seconds, the system switches from one state to the other.\n\nWe are given that the system was in state B 25 seconds ago. We need to determine the current state of the system.\n\nLet's break down the time intervals:\n\n1. 0-10 seconds: The system switches from state B to state A.\n2. 10-20 seconds: The system switches from state A to state B.\n3. 20-30 seconds: The system switches from state B to state A.\n\nSince we are at the 25-second mark, which falls within the third interval, the system is currently in state A."
