    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{\\frac{(x-1)^n}{n!}}\\right|$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \\cdot \\frac{n!}{(x-1)^n}\\right|$\n\nThe $(x-1)^n$ terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-1)}{n+1}\\right|$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the expression inside the absolute value approaches 0, which is less than 1. Therefore, the series converges for all x. This means that the radius of convergence is infinite.\n\nNow, let's find the interval of convergence. Since the radius of convergence is infinite, the interval of convergence is all real numbers:\n\n$(-\\infty, \\infty)$"
