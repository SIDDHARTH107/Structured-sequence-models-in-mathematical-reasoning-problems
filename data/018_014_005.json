    "message_2": "To find (AxB)' and A' x B', we first need to understand the notation and operations involved. AxB represents the Cartesian product of sets A and B, and the prime symbol (') denotes the complement of a set.\n\n1. Cartesian product (AxB): The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted by AxB, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. In this case, AxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}.\n\n2. Complement of a set (A', B'): The complement of a set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. Similarly, the complement of B, denoted by B', is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in B. To find A' and B', we need to know the universal set. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, A' = {3, 4} and B' = {1, 2}.\n\nNow, we can find (AxB)' and A' x B':\n\n(AxB)': The complement of AxB is the set of all ordered pairs in UxU that are not in AxB. Since U = {1, 2, 3, 4}, UxU = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}. Removing the elements of AxB, we get (AxB)' = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}.\n\nA' x B': The Cartesian product of A' and B' is the set of all ordered pairs (a', b') where a' is an element of A' and b' is an element of B'. In this case, A' x B' = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}.\n\nSo, (AxB)' = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)} and A' x B' = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}."
