    "message_1": "A company has gathered data on employee salaries, years of experience, and number of projects completed. They want to use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of their data. New variables have been created, with the weights of each original variable given by 0.6, 0.2, and 0.2, respectively. The first principal component explains 60% of the variance, and the second principal component explains 20% of the variance. Calculate the score for the first employee, whose values for the original variables are 50, 5, and 10, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the score for the first employee, we need to multiply their values for the original variables by the corresponding weights and then sum the results.\n\nEmployee's original values:\nSalary: 50\nYears of experience: 5\nNumber of projects: 10\n\nWeights for the new variables:\nSalary: 0.6\nYears of experience: 0.2\nNumber of projects: 0.2\n\nNow, we can calculate the score for the first principal component:\n\nScore = (Salary * Weight_salary) + (Years of experience * Weight_experience) + (Number of projects * Weight_projects)\nScore = (50 * 0.6) + (5 * 0.2) + (10 * 0.2)\nScore = 30 + 1 + 2\nScore = 33\n\nThe score for the first employee on the first principal component is 33."
