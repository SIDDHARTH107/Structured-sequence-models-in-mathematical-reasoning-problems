    "message_2": "The maximum angle of displacement of the lower pendulum in a double pendulum system cannot be determined analytically using a simple formula, as the motion of a double pendulum is highly complex and chaotic. The double pendulum system is a classic example of a chaotic system, where small changes in the initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes.\n\nTo find the maximum angle of displacement of the lower pendulum, one would need to use numerical methods and simulations to solve the equations of motion for the double pendulum system. This would involve using a computer program to simulate the motion of the double pendulum and track the angle of the lower pendulum over time.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the maximum angle of displacement of the lower pendulum can be significantly larger than the initial angle of the upper pendulum, depending on the specific conditions of the system. In some cases, the lower pendulum can even swing around multiple times, reaching angles greater than 360 degrees."
