    "message_1": "Consider the vector field on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ given by $X(x,y,z)=(2x-y+z, y+z, x+2y-3z)$. Let $F(x,y,z)=x^2y+yz^3$ be a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Find the Lie derivative of $F$ with respect to $X$ at the point $(1,1,1)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the Lie derivative of a scalar function $F$ with respect to a vector field $X$, we can use the following formula:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X F = X(F) = X^i \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^i}$$\n\nwhere $X^i$ are the components of the vector field $X$, and the sum is taken over the indices $i = 1, 2, 3$. In our case, we have:\n\n$$X(x,y,z) = (2x - y + z, y + z, x + 2y - 3z)$$\n\nand\n\n$$F(x,y,z) = x^2y + yz^3$$\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2xy$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = x^2 + z^3$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 3yz^2$$\n\nNow, we can compute the Lie derivative of $F$ with respect to $X$:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X F = X^i \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^i} = (2x - y + z) \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} + (y + z) \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} + (x + 2y - 3z) \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}$$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the Lie derivative at the point $(1,1,1)$. Plugging in the coordinates, we get:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X F(1,1,1) = (2 - 1 + 1)(2) + (1 + 1)(1 + 1) + (1 + 2 - 3)(3) = 4 + 4 + 0 = 8$$\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of $F$ with respect to $X$ at the point $(1,1,1)$ is $8$."
