    "message_1": "Two prisoners A and B are arrested and held in separate cells. They are both suspected of a crime and are given the option to cooperate with each other or betray each other. If both prisoners cooperate, they each receive a one-year sentence. If both prisoners betray each other, they each receive a five-year sentence. If one prisoner betrays the other and the other cooperates, the one who betrays goes free while the other receives a ten-year sentence. \n\nNow, if you are prisoner A and assume prisoner B is going to betray you, what is the best option for you and what is the expected outcome for you?",
    "message_2": "If you are prisoner A and you assume that prisoner B is going to betray you, then your best option is to also betray prisoner B. This is because if you betray B and B betrays you, you both receive a five-year sentence. However, if you cooperate with B and B betrays you, you would receive a ten-year sentence. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the best option for you is to betray prisoner B, and the expected outcome for you would be a five-year sentence."
