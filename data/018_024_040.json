    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of A and B, which is denoted by A Λ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA Λ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A, which is denoted by A'. The complement of a set A is the set of elements that are not in A.\n\nA' = {4} (assuming the universal set contains only the elements {1, 2, 3, 4})\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of (A Λ B) and A', which is denoted by (A Λ B) ∆ A'. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\n(A Λ B) ∆ A' = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and A', which is denoted by A ∆ A'.\n\nA ∆ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nFinally, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ A') and B, which is denoted by (A ∆ A') Λ B.\n\n(A ∆ A') Λ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, we can see that:\n\n(A Λ B) ∆ A' = {2, 3, 4}\n(A ∆ A') Λ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nSince both expressions are equal, this shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over complement in this specific case. However, this does not prove that it is always distributive over complement. To show that it is not distributive in general, we would need to find a counterexample where the two expressions are not equal."
