    "message_2": "To evaluate the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 3te^(-2t) using complex analysis, we need to use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(from 0 to ∞) f(t)e^(-st) dt\n\nIn our case, f(t) = 3te^(-2t). So, we need to evaluate the following integral:\n\nF(s) = ∫(from 0 to ∞) 3te^(-2t)e^(-st) dt\n\nFirst, let's combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(s) = ∫(from 0 to ∞) 3te^(-t(2+s)) dt\n\nNow, we will use integration by parts to solve this integral. Let u = t and dv = e^(-t(2+s)) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -1/((2+s))e^(-t(2+s)).\n\nIntegration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nF(s) = -3t/(2+s)e^(-t(2+s)) | (from 0 to ∞) - ∫(from 0 to ∞) (-3/(2+s))e^(-t(2+s)) dt\n\nThe first term goes to 0 as t goes to infinity, and the second term becomes:\n\nF(s) = 3/(2+s) ∫(from 0 to ∞) e^(-t(2+s)) dt\n\nNow, we can integrate the exponential term:\n\nF(s) = 3/(2+s) [-1/(2+s)e^(-t(2+s))] (from 0 to ∞)\n\nAs t goes to infinity, the exponential term goes to 0. When t = 0, the exponential term is 1. So, we have:\n\nF(s) = 3/(2+s) [0 - (-1/(2+s))]\n\nF(s) = 3/(2+s) * 1/(2+s)\n\nF(s) = 3/((2+s)^2)\n\nThus, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 3te^(-2t) is F(s) = 3/((2+s)^2)."
