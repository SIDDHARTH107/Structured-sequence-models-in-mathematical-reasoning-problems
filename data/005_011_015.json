    "message_1": "A math student is conducting an experiment to test the effectiveness of a new study method on test scores. He randomly selected 50 students, and divided them into two groups of 25. The first group received the new study method and the second group did not. After the experiment, he recorded the test scores of both groups. The mean test score for the first group was 80 and the standard deviation was 10. The mean test score for the second group was 70 and the standard deviation was 12. Can the student conclude that the new study method is effective in improving test scores? Use a 95% confidence level.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the new study method is effective in improving test scores, we can perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two groups. We are given the following information:\n\nGroup 1 (new study method):\n- Sample size (n1) = 25\n- Mean (x̄1) = 80\n- Standard deviation (s1) = 10\n\nGroup 2 (no new study method):\n- Sample size (n2) = 25\n- Mean (x̄2) = 70\n- Standard deviation (s2) = 12\n\nWe will use a 95% confidence level, which corresponds to an alpha level (α) of 0.05. Since we are comparing two groups, we will use a two-tailed test.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the pooled standard error (SE):\nSE = sqrt[(s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2)]\nSE = sqrt[(10^2/25) + (12^2/25)]\nSE = sqrt[(100/25) + (144/25)]\nSE = sqrt[4 + 5.76]\nSE = sqrt[9.76]\nSE = 3.12\n\nStep 2: Calculate the t-score:\nt = (x̄1 - x̄2) / SE\nt = (80 - 70) / 3.12\nt = 10 / 3.12\nt ≈ 3.21\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical t-value for a 95% confidence level and degrees of freedom (df):\nSince we have two groups with 25 students each, the degrees of freedom (df) = (n1 - 1) + (n2 - 1) = 24 + 24 = 48. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and df = 48 is approximately 2.01.\n\nStep 4: Compare the t-score to the critical t-value:\nOur calculated t-score (3.21) is greater than the critical t-value (2.01).\n\nSince the t-score is greater than the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the means of the two groups. Therefore, the student can conclude that the new study method is effective in improving test scores at a 95% confidence level."
