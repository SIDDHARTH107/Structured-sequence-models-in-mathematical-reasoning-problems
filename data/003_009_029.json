    "message_2": "Since we have a right triangle with one acute angle measuring 30 degrees, the other acute angle must measure 60 degrees (because the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, and we have a right angle of 90 degrees).\n\nNow, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest side, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the middle-length side, and the hypotenuse is the longest side.\n\nSince the hypotenuse is given as 10 units, we can set up a proportion to find the other two sides:\n\n2 (the ratio for the hypotenuse) corresponds to 10 units, so:\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nNow we can find the lengths of the other two sides by multiplying the ratio by x:\n\n- Side opposite the 30-degree angle: 1 * 5 = 5 units\n- Side opposite the 60-degree angle: √3 * 5 = 5√3 units\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = 5 + 5√3 + 10 = 15 + 5√3 units"
