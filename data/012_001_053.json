    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 7, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distance of all other nodes to infinity.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   Distance: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞, 6: ∞, 7: ∞}\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (node 1) and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   Distance: {1: 0, 2: 7, 3: 9, 4: ∞, 5: ∞, 6: 14, 7: ∞}\n\n3. Mark node 1 as visited and select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 2).\n\n4. Update the distances of node 2's neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   Distance: {1: 0, 2: 7, 3: 9, 4: 15, 5: ∞, 6: 14, 7: ∞}\n\n5. Mark node 2 as visited and select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 3).\n\n6. Update the distances of node 3's neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {4, 5, 6, 7}\n   Distance: {1: 0, 2: 7, 3: 9, 4: 11, 5: ∞, 6: 14, 7: ∞}\n\n7. Mark node 3 as visited and select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 4).\n\n8. Update the distances of node 4's neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {5, 6, 7}\n   Distance: {1: 0, 2: 7, 3: 9, 4: 11, 5: 12, 6: 14, 7: ∞}\n\n9. Mark node 4 as visited and select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 5).\n\n10. Update the distances of node 5's neighbors.\n\n    Unvisited nodes: {6, 7}\n    Distance: {1: 0, 2: 7, 3: 9, 4: 11, 5: 12, 6: 14, 7: 20}\n\n11. Mark node 5 as visited and select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 6).\n\n12. Update the distances of node 6's neighbors.\n\n    Unvisited nodes: {7}\n    Distance: {1: 0, 2: 7, 3: 9, 4: 11, 5: 12, 6: 14, 7: 20}\n\n13. Mark node 6 as visited and select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 7).\n\n14. Since node 7 is the destination, the algorithm stops here.\n\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 7 is 1 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 7 with a total distance of 20."
