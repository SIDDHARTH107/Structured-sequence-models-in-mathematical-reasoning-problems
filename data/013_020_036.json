    "message_1": "In a Beauty Contest Game, there are 4 players who must choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen. What number should each player choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning, each player should assume that the other players are also trying to maximize their chances. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. If all players choose a number between 0 and 100, the maximum average would be 100. In this case, 2/3 of the average would be 200/3 ≈ 66.67.\n\n2. However, if all players know that the target is 2/3 of the average, they should also assume that no one will choose a number greater than 66.67. So, the new maximum average would be 66.67, and 2/3 of this new average would be 2/3 * 66.67 ≈ 44.44.\n\n3. Following the same logic, players should now assume that no one will choose a number greater than 44.44. The new maximum average would be 44.44, and 2/3 of this new average would be 2/3 * 44.44 ≈ 29.63.\n\n4. This process can be repeated indefinitely, with each iteration reducing the maximum number that players should choose. However, in practice, the iterations will converge to a point where the difference between the new maximum number and the previous one becomes negligible.\n\nIn conclusion, to maximize their chances of winning, each player should choose a number close to the result of the iterations, which is around 29.63. However, since other players might also choose this number, it might be a good strategy to choose a slightly different number close to 29.63 to avoid ties."
