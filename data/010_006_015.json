    "message_2": "To show that the degree of $f$ is $(-1)^{k+1}$, we will use the fact that the degree of a continuous map can be computed as the sum of local degrees at each point in a regular value set. Let $y \\in S^n$ be a regular value of $f$. Then, the preimage $f^{-1}(y)$ consists of a finite number of points, say $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m$. The local degree of $f$ at each $x_i$ is either $1$ or $-1$, depending on whether the orientation of the tangent space is preserved or reversed at $x_i$.\n\nNow, consider the antipodal points $x$ and $-x$ such that $f(x) = -x$ and $f(-x) = x$. Since $f$ is continuous, the orientation of the tangent space is reversed at both $x$ and $-x$. Therefore, the local degree of $f$ at $x$ and $-x$ is $-1$.\n\nFor the remaining points in the preimage $f^{-1}(y)$, the orientation of the tangent space is preserved, and the local degree of $f$ at these points is $1$. Let $l$ be the number of such points. Then, the total degree of $f$ is given by the sum of local degrees at all points in the preimage $f^{-1}(y)$:\n\n$$\\deg(f) = (-1)^k + l$$\n\nSince $l$ is even (because the remaining points come in antipodal pairs), we can write $l = 2p$ for some integer $p$. Then,\n\n$$\\deg(f) = (-1)^k + 2p = (-1)^k + (-1)^{2p} = (-1)^{k+1}$$\n\nNow, let's determine the degree of the map $f: S^2 \\to S^2$, $f(x,y,z) = (-x,-y,z)$. In this case, there is only one antipodal pair of points $(x, y, z)$ and $(-x, -y, -z)$ such that $f(x, y, z) = - (x, y, z)$ and $f(-x, -y, -z) = (x, y, z)$. Thus, $k = 1$. Using the result above, the degree of this map is:\n\n$$\\deg(f) = (-1)^{k+1} = (-1)^{1+1} = (-1)^2 = 1$$"
