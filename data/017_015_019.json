    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the possibilities for G.\n\n1. G could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C24. In this case, G would be generated by a single element of order 24.\n\n2. G cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A5, since A5 has order 5! = 120, not 24.\n\n3. There are five non-abelian groups of order 24, which are:\n\n   a) The symmetric group S4 (order 4! = 24)\n   b) The semidirect product of Z4 and Z6 (order 4*6 = 24)\n   c) The semidirect product of Z2 and Z12 (order 2*12 = 24)\n   d) The semidirect product of Z3 and Z8 (order 3*8 = 24)\n   e) The semidirect product of Z2 and Z4 x Z2 (order 2*4*2 = 24)\n\nNow, let's consider each case:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C24, then there exists an element g in G with order 24. The isomorphism φ: G → C24 can be defined as φ(g^k) = k (mod 24), where g^k is an element in G and k is an integer between 0 and 23.\n\n2. As mentioned earlier, G cannot be isomorphic to A5.\n\n3. For the non-abelian groups of order 24:\n\n   a) If G is isomorphic to S4, then G can be represented as the group of permutations of 4 elements. The isomorphism φ: G → S4 can be defined by mapping each element of G to its corresponding permutation in S4.\n\n   b) If G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z4 and Z6, then G can be represented as a set of ordered pairs (a, b), where a is an element of Z4 and b is an element of Z6. The isomorphism φ: G → Z4 ⋊ Z6 can be defined by mapping each element of G to its corresponding ordered pair (a, b).\n\n   c) Similarly, if G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z2 and Z12, the isomorphism φ: G → Z2 ⋊ Z12 can be defined by mapping each element of G to its corresponding ordered pair (a, b), where a is an element of Z2 and b is an element of Z12.\n\n   d) If G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z3 and Z8, the isomorphism φ: G → Z3 ⋊ Z8 can be defined by mapping each element of G to its corresponding ordered pair (a, b), where a is an element of Z3 and b is an element of Z8.\n\n   e) If G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z2 and Z4 x Z2, the isomorphism φ: G → Z2 ⋊ (Z4 x Z2) can be defined by mapping each element of G to its corresponding ordered triple (a, b, c), where a is an element of Z2, b is an element of Z4, and c is an element of Z2.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C24 or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, one would need more information about the structure of G. Once that information is available, an explicit isomorphism can be provided as described above."
