    "message_1": "A basketball player has a free-throw percentage of 85%. If she takes 10 free-throws in a game, what is the probability that she will make exactly 7 of them?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of making exactly k free-throws\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of free-throws (10 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful free-throws (7 in this case)\n- p is the probability of making a free-throw (0.85 in this case)\n- (1-p) is the probability of missing a free-throw (0.15 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 successful free-throws out of 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / (5040 * 6)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / 30240\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * p^7 * (1-p)^(10-7)\nP(X = 7) = 120 * (0.85)^7 * (0.15)^3\n\nP(X = 7) ≈ 120 * 0.3203 * 0.003375\nP(X = 7) ≈ 129.96 * 0.003375\nP(X = 7) ≈ 0.4384\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player will make exactly 7 out of 10 free-throws is approximately 43.84%."
