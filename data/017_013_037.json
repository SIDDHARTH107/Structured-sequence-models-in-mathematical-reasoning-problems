    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. Since 18 = 2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 9 and a Sylow 2-subgroup Q of order 2 in G. Let's analyze the possibilities for these subgroups and their relationships to determine the possible isomorphisms for G.\n\n1. Cyclic group C18:\nIf G has an element of order 18, then G is a cyclic group of order 18, and thus isomorphic to C18. So, let's assume G does not have an element of order 18 and proceed to the other possibilities.\n\n2. Non-abelian group of order 18:\nSince the order of P is 9, which is a prime power, P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. However, since there is only one group of order 9 up to isomorphism (C9), P must be isomorphic to C9. Now, let's consider the normality of P in G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 18/9 = 2, and n_3 ≡ 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 = 1, and P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the Sylow 2-subgroup Q. Since the order of Q is 2, Q is isomorphic to C2. Since P is normal in G and |P ∩ Q| = 1 (as their orders are coprime), by the product formula, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 18, which implies PQ = G. Therefore, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as G = P ⋊ Q.\n\nIf the action of Q on P is trivial, then G is the direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to C9 × C2. However, if the action is nontrivial, then G is a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6:\nIf G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6, then G must be isomorphic to C3 × (C6 or D3), where D3 is the dihedral group of order 6. In this case, G is abelian and has a unique element of order 6, which is not the case for the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine which group G is isomorphic to, we can analyze the structure of its Sylow subgroups and their actions on each other. If G has an element of order 18, it is isomorphic to C18. If the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup is nontrivial, G is a non-abelian group of order 18. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 (C3 × C6 or C3 × D3)."
