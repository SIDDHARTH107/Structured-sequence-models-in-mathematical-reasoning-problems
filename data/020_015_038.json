    "message_2": "To find the dimensions of the building with the maximum area that can be constructed within the given piece of land, we can use the concept of optimization.\n\nLet the dimensions of the building be x meters and y meters, where x is the length and y is the width. The area of the building can be represented as A = xy.\n\nSince the building must be constructed within the land, we have the constraints:\n\n0 < x ≤ 100\n0 < y ≤ 80\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a function F(x, y, λ, μ) = xy - λ(x - 100) - μ(y - 80), where λ and μ are the Lagrange multipliers.\n\nNow we find the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, λ, and μ and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂F/∂x = y - λ = 0\n∂F/∂y = x - μ = 0\n∂F/∂λ = x - 100 = 0\n∂F/∂μ = y - 80 = 0\n\nFrom the third and fourth equations, we have x = 100 and y = 80. Substituting these values into the first and second equations, we get:\n\n80 - λ = 0\n100 - μ = 0\n\nSolving for λ and μ, we find λ = 80 and μ = 100. However, these values of λ and μ do not give us any information about the dimensions of the building.\n\nSince the building is to be constructed within the land, the maximum area will be achieved when the building covers the entire piece of land. Therefore, the dimensions of the building with the maximum area are 100 meters by 80 meters."
