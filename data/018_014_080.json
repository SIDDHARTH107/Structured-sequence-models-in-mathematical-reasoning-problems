    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. \n\nFind the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by A × B.\n\nNext, find the complement of A and B, denoted by A' and B' respectively.\n\nFinally, find the Cartesian product of the complements A' × B' and compare it to the complement of A × B. Do they differ? Explain why.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by A × B. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNext, let's find the complement of A and B, denoted by A' and B' respectively. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. However, since we don't have a universal set defined, we cannot find the complements A' and B'.\n\nTo proceed with the last part of the question, we would need a universal set defined for both A and B. Let's assume the universal set U_A for A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and the universal set U_B for B is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Now we can find the complements A' and B'.\n\nA' = {4, 5, 6} (elements in U_A that are not in A)\nB' = {6, 7, 8} (elements in U_B that are not in B)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the complements A' × B':\n\nA' × B' = {(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A × B with respect to the universal set U_A × U_B. The universal set for the Cartesian product would be the Cartesian product of the individual universal sets:\n\nU_A × U_B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)}\n\nThe complement of A × B with respect to U_A × U_B is the set of all elements in U_A × U_B that are not in A × B:\n\n(A × B)' = {(1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 4), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)}\n\nComparing A' × B' and (A × B)', we can see that they are different:\n\nA' × B' = {(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)}\n(A × B)' = {(1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 4), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)}\n\nThey differ because the Cartesian product of the complements A' × B' only includes ordered pairs where both elements are from the complements of A and B, while the complement of A × B, (A × B)', includes ordered pairs where at least one element is not in A or B."
