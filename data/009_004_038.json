    "message_1": "A spring with a mass of 0.5 kg attached to it is stretched by 0.2 meters from its equilibrium position. If the spring constant is 100 N/m, what is the frequency of the resulting oscillation?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the resulting oscillation, we can use the formula for the angular frequency (ω) of a simple harmonic oscillator:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (100 N/m) and m is the mass attached to the spring (0.5 kg).\n\nω = √(100 N/m / 0.5 kg) = √(200 s^(-2))\n\nω ≈ 14.14 rad/s\n\nNow, we can find the frequency (f) by dividing the angular frequency by 2π:\n\nf = ω / 2π\n\nf ≈ 14.14 rad/s / 6.28\n\nf ≈ 2.25 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the resulting oscillation is approximately 2.25 Hz."
