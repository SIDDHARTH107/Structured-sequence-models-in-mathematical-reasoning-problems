    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to maximize their profit while minimizing their production cost. They can produce two types of products that require different amounts of resources. Product A requires 2 units of labor and 3 units of material to be produced, while product B requires 3 units of labor and 2 units of material to be produced. Each unit of product A sold yields a profit of $20 and each unit of product B sold yields a profit of $30. The company has a total of 360 units of labor and 270 units of material available for production. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit while using all of their available resources?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y, subject to the constraints of available labor and material.\n\nThe constraints are:\n2x + 3y ≤ 360 (labor constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 270 (material constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints. To do this, we will rewrite the inequalities as equalities and solve for y:\n\nLabor constraint: y = (360 - 2x) / 3\nMaterial constraint: y = (270 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the intersection points of these lines with the axes:\n\nFor the labor constraint:\nx = 0: y = (360 - 2(0)) / 3 = 120\ny = 0: x = (360 - 3(0)) / 2 = 180\n\nFor the material constraint:\nx = 0: y = (270 - 3(0)) / 2 = 135\ny = 0: x = (270 - 2(0)) / 3 = 90\n\nNow, we will find the intersection point of the two lines by setting the equations equal to each other:\n\n(360 - 2x) / 3 = (270 - 3x) / 2\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n2(360 - 2x) = 3(270 - 3x)\n720 - 4x = 810 - 9x\n5x = 90\nx = 18\n\nSubstituting x back into one of the equations to find y:\n\ny = (360 - 2(18)) / 3\ny = (360 - 36) / 3\ny = 324 / 3\ny = 108\n\nSo, the intersection point is (18, 108).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y at each of the intersection points and the origin (0, 0):\n\nP(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\nP(180, 0) = 20(180) + 30(0) = $3600\nP(0, 120) = 20(0) + 30(120) = $3600\nP(18, 108) = 20(18) + 30(108) = $360 + $3240 = $3600\nP(90, 0) = 20(90) + 30(0) = $1800\nP(0, 135) = 20(0) + 30(135) = $4050\n\nThe maximum profit is $4050, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 135 units of product B."
