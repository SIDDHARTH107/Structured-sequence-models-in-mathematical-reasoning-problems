    "message_1": "A math student needs to graph the following inequality on a coordinate plane: y < 2x + 3.",
    "message_2": "To graph the inequality y < 2x + 3, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, treat the inequality as an equation and graph the line y = 2x + 3. This line will serve as a boundary for the inequality.\n\n2. To graph the line y = 2x + 3, find the y-intercept and the slope. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. In this case, the y-intercept is 3, so the point is (0, 3).\n\n3. The slope of the line is 2, which means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. Starting from the y-intercept (0, 3), move 1 unit to the right and 2 units up to find another point on the line. This point is (1, 5).\n\n4. Plot the points (0, 3) and (1, 5) on the coordinate plane and draw a straight line through them. Since the inequality is y < 2x + 3 (and not y â‰¤ 2x + 3), the line should be dashed to indicate that the points on the line are not included in the solution.\n\n5. To determine which side of the line to shade, choose a test point that is not on the line. A common test point is the origin (0, 0). Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality: 0 < 2(0) + 3, which simplifies to 0 < 3. This statement is true, so the region containing the test point (0, 0) should be shaded.\n\n6. Shade the region below the dashed line, as this represents the solution to the inequality y < 2x + 3. All points in this shaded region satisfy the inequality."
