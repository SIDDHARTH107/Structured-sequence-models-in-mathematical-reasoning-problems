    "message_2": "The fundamental group of a torus is given by the direct product of two copies of the integers, i.e., π1(T^2) = Z × Z, where T^2 represents the torus.\n\nWhen we remove a point from the torus, the resulting space is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of two circles. This is because, after removing a point, we can contract the remaining part of the torus to two circles that intersect at a single point. The fundamental group of a bouquet of two circles is the free product of the fundamental groups of the individual circles, which are both isomorphic to the integers.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the space formed by removing a point from a torus is the free product of two copies of the integers, i.e., π1(T^2 - {x}) = Z * Z, where x is the removed point."
