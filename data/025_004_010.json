    "message_2": "Since $C$ is a non-singular projective curve of degree 3, it is a smooth cubic curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. Let the four distinct points of intersection between $C$ and $L$ be $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. We want to find a rational function $f$ on $C$ such that the divisor of $f$ is $(P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4) - (p_\\infty)$.\n\nConsider the linear system of divisors on $C$ given by $|D|$, where $D = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 - p_\\infty$. The dimension of this linear system, $l(D)$, is given by the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$l(D) = \\deg(D) - g + 1 = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4$,\n\nwhere $g$ is the genus of the curve $C$. Since $C$ is a smooth cubic curve, its genus is 1.\n\nNow, we want to show that there exists a unique rational function $f$ on $C$ such that the divisor of $f$ is $D$. Since $l(D) = 4$, there are 4 linearly independent rational functions on $C$ with divisor $D$. However, we can subtract a constant function from any of these rational functions to obtain another rational function with the same divisor. Thus, there exists a unique rational function $f$ on $C$ with divisor $D$ up to a constant factor.\n\nTo find this rational function $f$, we can use the fact that the intersection of $C$ and $L$ is given by the four points $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. Let $C$ be given by the homogeneous equation $F(x, y, z) = 0$ and $L$ be given by the homogeneous equation $G(x, y, z) = 0$. Then, the rational function $f$ can be defined as the ratio of the two homogeneous polynomials:\n\n$f = \\frac{G(x, y, z)}{F(x, y, z)}$.\n\nSince $G(x, y, z)$ has degree 1 and $F(x, y, z)$ has degree 3, the divisor of $f$ is given by the intersection of $C$ and $L$ minus the point at infinity $p_\\infty$. Thus, the divisor of $f$ is $(P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4) - (p_\\infty)$, as desired."
