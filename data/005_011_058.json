    "message_1": "A researcher wants to test the effectiveness of two different fertilizers on plant growth. They have 10 identical plants and divide them randomly into two groups of 5. The first group is given Fertilizer A and the second group is given Fertilizer B. After 4 weeks, the heights of the plants are measured. Calculate the mean height and standard deviation of each group, and determine whether there is a significant difference in growth between the two groups.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mean height and standard deviation of each group, we need the heights of the plants in each group. Please provide the heights of the plants in both groups."
