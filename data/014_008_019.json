    "message_2": "Triple-DES (3DES) is a symmetric key block cipher that applies the DES encryption algorithm three times with three different keys. Since each DES key is 64 bits, the total key size for 3DES is 3 * 64 = 192 bits. However, in each 64-bit DES key, 8 bits are used for parity, so the effective key size for each DES key is 56 bits. Therefore, the effective key size for 3DES is 3 * 56 = 168 bits. \n\nIn summary, the number of keys required for a triple-DES (3DES) block cipher with a key size and block size of 64 bits each is 3 keys, with an effective key size of 168 bits."
