    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot determine the specific answer to the math problem without knowing the problem itself. However, I can help you understand the probabilities involved in this situation.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. John knows the answer with a probability of 0.7.\n2. John lies with a probability of 0.3.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: John knows the answer and tells the truth.\n- Probability: 0.7 (knows the answer) * 0.7 (tells the truth) = 0.49\n\nScenario 2: John knows the answer but lies.\n- Probability: 0.7 (knows the answer) * 0.3 (lies) = 0.21\n\nScenario 3: John doesn't know the answer but tells the truth.\n- Probability: 0.3 (doesn't know the answer) * 0.7 (tells the truth) = 0.21\n\nScenario 4: John doesn't know the answer and lies.\n- Probability: 0.3 (doesn't know the answer) * 0.3 (lies) = 0.09\n\nNow, let's analyze the scenarios:\n\n- If John is telling the truth (Scenario 1), there's a 0.49 probability that he knows the answer.\n- If John is lying (Scenario 2), there's a 0.21 probability that he knows the answer.\n\nHowever, without knowing the math problem itself, we cannot determine the specific answer."
