    "message_2": "To find the time it takes for the car to reach a velocity of 50 m/s, we can use the formula:\n\nfinal velocity = initial velocity + (acceleration × time)\n\nWe are given the initial velocity (20 m/s), the acceleration (3 m/s²), and the final velocity (50 m/s). We need to find the time (t).\n\n50 m/s = 20 m/s + (3 m/s² × t)\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\n30 m/s = 3 m/s² × t\n\nt = 30 m/s ÷ 3 m/s²\n\nt = 10 seconds\n\nIt will take 10 seconds for the car to reach a velocity of 50 m/s."
