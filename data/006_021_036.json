    "message_1": "In a forest of 500 trees, it is known that 60% of them are Oak trees, 25% are Maple trees, and 15% are Pine trees. If a moth species is known to predominantly feed on Oak trees, what is the probability that a randomly chosen tree in the forest will be attacked by the species?",
    "message_2": "Since the moth species predominantly feeds on Oak trees, we can assume that the probability of a randomly chosen tree being attacked by the species is equal to the probability of choosing an Oak tree.\n\nThere are 500 trees in total, and 60% of them are Oak trees. To find the number of Oak trees, we can multiply the total number of trees by the percentage of Oak trees:\n\n500 trees * 0.60 (60%) = 300 Oak trees\n\nNow, to find the probability of choosing an Oak tree (and thus the probability of the tree being attacked by the moth species), we can divide the number of Oak trees by the total number of trees:\n\n300 Oak trees / 500 trees = 0.6\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen tree in the forest will be attacked by the moth species is 0.6 or 60%."
