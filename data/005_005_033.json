    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected bulb will weigh between 55 and 65 grams, we will use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we will find the z-scores for 55 grams and 65 grams.\n\nFor 55 grams:\nz1 = (55 - 60) / 5\nz1 = -5 / 5\nz1 = -1\n\nFor 65 grams:\nz2 = (65 - 60) / 5\nz2 = 5 / 5\nz2 = 1\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nFor z1 = -1, the probability is 0.1587 (from the table).\nFor z2 = 1, the probability is 0.8413 (from the table).\n\nTo find the probability that a bulb weighs between 55 and 65 grams, we will subtract the probability of z1 from the probability of z2:\n\nP(55 < X < 65) = P(z2) - P(z1)\nP(55 < X < 65) = 0.8413 - 0.1587\nP(55 < X < 65) = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected bulb will weigh between 55 and 65 grams is approximately 0.6826 or 68.26%."
