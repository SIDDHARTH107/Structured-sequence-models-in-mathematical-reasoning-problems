    "message_2": "To solve the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the Fourier series expansion method. First, we expand the initial condition $u(x,0) = 2\\cos(x)$ in a Fourier series:\n\n$u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_n e^{inx}$\n\nSince $u(x,0) = 2\\cos(x)$ is an even function, we only need to consider the cosine terms in the Fourier series:\n\n$u(x,0) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\cos(nx)$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we find that $a_0 = 0$, $a_1 = 2$, and $a_n = 0$ for $n \\geq 2$. Thus, the Fourier series expansion of the initial condition is:\n\n$u(x,0) = 2\\cos(x)$\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier series expansion of the initial time derivative $u_t(x,0) = -\\sin(x)$. Since this is an odd function, we only need to consider the sine terms:\n\n$u_t(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(nx)$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we find that $b_1 = -1$ and $b_n = 0$ for $n \\geq 2$. Thus, the Fourier series expansion of the initial time derivative is:\n\n$u_t(x,0) = -\\sin(x)$\n\nNow, we can use the method of separation of variables to solve the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We assume a solution of the form:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n(t) e^{inx}$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation and comparing the coefficients, we obtain a set of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients $c_n(t)$. Solving these equations with the initial conditions $c_n(0) = a_n$ and $c_n'(0) = b_n$, we find that:\n\n$c_1(t) = 2\\cos(t) - \\sin(t)$\n\nand $c_n(t) = 0$ for $n \\neq 1$. Thus, the solution of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is:\n\n$u(x,t) = (2\\cos(t) - \\sin(t))\\cos(x)$\n\nFinally, we can find the value of $u(\\pi/2,1)$:\n\n$u(\\pi/2,1) = (2\\cos(1) - \\sin(1))\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0$\n\nSo, the value of $u(\\pi/2,1)$ is 0 (to 4 decimal places)."
