    "message_2": "To prove that the set of points in $M$ where $f$ attains its maximum value is a closed subset of $M$, we will show that the complement of this set is an open subset of $M$.\n\nLet $A = \\{x \\in M \\mid f(x) = \\max_{y \\in M} f(y)\\}$ be the set of points where $f$ attains its maximum value. Then, the complement of $A$ is $A^c = \\{x \\in M \\mid f(x) < \\max_{y \\in M} f(y)\\}$. We will show that $A^c$ is an open subset of $M$.\n\nLet $x \\in A^c$. Then, $f(x) < \\max_{y \\in M} f(y)$. Since $f$ is a smooth function, there exists a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that for all $y \\in U_x$, $f(y) < \\max_{z \\in M} f(z)$. This implies that $U_x \\subseteq A^c$. Since $x$ was arbitrary, we have shown that for every $x \\in A^c$, there exists an open neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $U_x \\subseteq A^c$. Therefore, $A^c$ is an open subset of $M$.\n\nSince the complement of $A$ is open, it follows that $A$ is a closed subset of $M$.\n\nNow, let's consider a specific smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ and a specific smooth function $f:M\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$. Without loss of generality, let $M = \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f(x) = -\\|x\\|^2$ for $x \\in M$. Then, $f$ attains its maximum value at $x = 0$, and the set of points where $f$ attains its maximum value is $A = \\{0\\}$. Since singletons are closed subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the set $A$ is closed in this case."
