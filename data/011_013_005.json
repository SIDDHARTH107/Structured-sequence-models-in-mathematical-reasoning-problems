    "message_1": "In how many ways can we color the faces of a regular tetrahedron with four colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) if the colorings are considered the same when a rotation of the tetrahedron leads to an identical coloring?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Burnside's Lemma. Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings of an object, up to symmetry, is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry operation.\n\nA regular tetrahedron has 12 symmetries: the identity (no rotation), 8 rotations of 120 degrees around an axis passing through a vertex and the center of the opposite face, and 3 rotations of 180 degrees around an axis passing through the midpoints of two opposite edges.\n\n1. Identity (no rotation): All 4^4 = 256 colorings are fixed.\n2. 120-degree rotations (8 of them): Each of these rotations fixes a coloring if and only if the three faces around the vertex have the same color. There are 4 choices for the color of the vertex, and 4 choices for the color of the opposite face, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 fixed colorings for each of these rotations.\n3. 180-degree rotations (3 of them): Each of these rotations fixes a coloring if and only if the two pairs of opposite faces have the same color. There are 4 choices for each pair of opposite faces, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 fixed colorings for each of these rotations.\n\nNow, we apply Burnside's Lemma:\n\nNumber of distinct colorings = (1 x 256 + 8 x 16 + 3 x 16) / 12 = (256 + 128 + 48) / 12 = 432 / 12 = 36.\n\nSo, there are 36 distinct ways to color the faces of a regular tetrahedron with four colors, up to rotation."
