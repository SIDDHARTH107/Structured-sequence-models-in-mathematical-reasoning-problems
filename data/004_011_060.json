    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder and then apply the concept of related rates.\n\nThe volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, the radius r is constant at 5 meters, but the height h is changing as the water leaks out.\n\nWe are given that the rate of change of the volume with respect to time (dV/dt) is -0.1 cubic meters per minute (negative because the volume is decreasing). We want to find the rate of change of the height with respect to time (dh/dt) when the height h is 8 meters.\n\nFirst, let's differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:\n\ndV/dt = πr^2(dh/dt)\n\nNow, plug in the given values: dV/dt = -0.1 m³/min, r = 5 m, and h = 8 m.\n\n-0.1 = π(5)^2(dh/dt)\n\nNow, solve for dh/dt:\n\n-0.1 = 25π(dh/dt)\n\ndh/dt = -0.1 / (25π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ -0.00127324 m/min\n\nSo, the water level is dropping at a rate of approximately -0.00127324 meters per minute when the water is 8 meters deep."
