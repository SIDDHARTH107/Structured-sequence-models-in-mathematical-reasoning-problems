    "message_2": "Since each ball can be chosen more than once and the order of selection matters, we can use the counting principle to solve this problem. For each of the 3 selections, there are 10 choices (as there are 10 different colored balls).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select and arrange 3 balls is:\n\n10 choices (for the first ball) * 10 choices (for the second ball) * 10 choices (for the third ball) = 10^3 = 1000 ways."
