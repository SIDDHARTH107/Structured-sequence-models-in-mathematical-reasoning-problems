    "message_2": "In a topological space, the empty set and the whole space X are always both open and closed sets. So, we know that there are at least 2 closed sets (the empty set and X itself).\n\nNow, let's consider the complement of each open set in X. The complement of an open set is a closed set. Since there are 10 open sets, we have 10 complements, which are closed sets. However, we need to account for the fact that the empty set and X are both open and closed, so their complements are also the empty set and X, which we have already counted.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of closed sets that X must contain is 10 - 2 + 2 = 10."
