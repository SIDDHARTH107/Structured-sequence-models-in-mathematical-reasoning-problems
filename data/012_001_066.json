    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 5 nodes and the following edges: (1,2) with weight 4, (1,3) with weight 3, (2,3) with weight 2, (2,4) with weight 1, (3,5) with weight 2, and (4,5) with weight 3. \n\nWhat is the shortest path weight from node 1 to node 5?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest path weight from node 1 to node 5, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (node 1) as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (node 1) and mark it as visited.\n\n3. Update the distances of neighboring nodes (nodes 2 and 3) by adding the edge weight to the current node's distance. If the new distance is smaller than the previous distance, update the distance.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (node 5) is visited.\n\nHere's the algorithm applied to the given graph:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; distances: {0, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞}\n2. Visit node 1; unvisited nodes: {2, 3, 4, 5}; distances: {0, 4, 3, ∞, ∞}\n3. Visit node 3; unvisited nodes: {2, 4, 5}; distances: {0, 4, 3, ∞, 5}\n4. Visit node 2; unvisited nodes: {4, 5}; distances: {0, 4, 3, 5, 5}\n5. Visit node 5; target node visited.\n\nThe shortest path weight from node 1 to node 5 is 5."
