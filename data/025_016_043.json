    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection of the curve C with the line x=1, we need to substitute x=1 into the equation of the curve and solve for y.\n\nThe equation of the curve is y^2 = x^3 - x^2. Substituting x=1, we get:\n\ny^2 = (1)^3 - (1)^2\ny^2 = 1 - 1\ny^2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for y:\n\ny = Â±sqrt(0)\ny = 0\n\nSo, there is only one point of intersection between the curve C and the line x=1, which is the point (1, 0)."
