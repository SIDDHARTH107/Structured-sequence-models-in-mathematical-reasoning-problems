    "message_1": "Tom wants to buy a total of 12 apples and oranges. The cost of an apple is 75 cents and the cost of an orange is 60 cents. If the total cost of the fruits is $8.40, how many of each fruit did Tom buy? Using causal logic, determine the relation between the number of apples and the number of oranges that Tom has bought.",
    "message_2": "Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of apples and y be the number of oranges.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) x + y = 12 (total number of fruits)\n2) 0.75x + 0.60y = 8.40 (total cost of fruits)\n\nFirst, we can solve equation (1) for y:\n\ny = 12 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in equation (2):\n\n0.75x + 0.60(12 - x) = 8.40\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n0.75x + 7.20 - 0.60x = 8.40\n0.15x = 1.20\nx = 8\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:\n\ny = 12 - x\ny = 12 - 8\ny = 4\n\nSo, Tom bought 8 apples and 4 oranges.\n\nUsing causal logic, we can say that the more apples Tom buys, the fewer oranges he can buy, since he wants to buy a total of 12 fruits. Similarly, the more oranges he buys, the fewer apples he can buy. There is an inverse relationship between the number of apples and the number of oranges Tom buys."
