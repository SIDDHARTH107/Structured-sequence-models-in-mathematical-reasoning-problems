    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting 6 or more heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips), which is 10 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want, which is 6 or more\n\nWe need to calculate the probability for getting 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads and then sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 6) = P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\n\nLet's calculate each probability:\n\n1. P(X = 6):\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6!4!) = 210\nP(X = 6) = 210 * (0.5)^6 * (0.5)^4 = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625 ≈ 0.205078\n\n2. P(X = 7):\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!3!) = 120\nP(X = 7) = 120 * (0.5)^7 * (0.5)^3 = 120 * 0.0078125 * 0.125 ≈ 0.117188\n\n3. P(X = 8):\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8!2!) = 45\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.5)^8 * (0.5)^2 = 45 * 0.00390625 * 0.25 ≈ 0.043945\n\n4. P(X = 9):\nC(10, 9) = 10! / (9!1!) = 10\nP(X = 9) = 10 * (0.5)^9 * (0.5)^1 = 10 * 0.001953125 * 0.5 ≈ 0.009766\n\n5. P(X = 10):\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10!0!) = 1\nP(X = 10) = 1 * (0.5)^10 * (0.5)^0 = 1 * 0.0009765625 * 1 ≈ 0.000977\n\nNow, let's sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 6) = 0.205078 + 0.117188 + 0.043945 + 0.009766 + 0.000977 ≈ 0.376954\n\nSo, the probability of getting 6 or more heads in 10 coin flips with a fair coin is approximately 0.376954 or 37.7%."
