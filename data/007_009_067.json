    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). To compute φ(36), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of 36: 36 = 2^2 * 3^2.\n\nNow, we can plug these prime factors into the formula:\n\nφ(36) = 36 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(36) = 36 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(36) = 36 * (1/3)\nφ(36) = 12\n\nSo, the Euler's totient function of the number 36 is 12."
