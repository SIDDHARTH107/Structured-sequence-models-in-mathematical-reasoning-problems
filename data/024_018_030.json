    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface by a map X(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2). Then, we can compute the tangent vectors Xu and Xv:\n\nXu = (1, 0, 2u)\nXv = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNow, we can compute the first fundamental form, which is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [ <Xu, Xu>, <Xu, Xv> ]\n      [ <Xv, Xu>, <Xv, Xv> ]\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 0), we have:\n\nI = [ <(1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 2)>, <(1, 0, 2), (0, 1, -2)> ]\n      [ <(0, 1, -2), (1, 0, 2)>, <(0, 1, -2), (0, 1, -2)> ]\n\nI = [ 5, -2 ]\n      [ -2, 5 ]\n\nNext, we need to compute the second fundamental form. To do this, we first find the normal vector N to the surface:\n\nN = Xu Ã— Xv = (2u, 2v, 1)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 0), we have N = (2, 2, 1). Now, we can compute the second fundamental form, which is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [ <Xuu, N>, <Xuv, N> ]\n         [ <Xvu, N>, <Xvv, N> ]\n\nSince the surface is given by z = x^2 - y^2, we have:\n\nXuu = (0, 0, 2)\nXuv = (0, 0, 0)\nXvv = (0, 0, -2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 0), we have:\n\nII = [ <(0, 0, 2), (2, 2, 1)>, <(0, 0, 0), (2, 2, 1)> ]\n         [ <(0, 0, 0), (2, 2, 1)>, <(0, 0, -2), (2, 2, 1)> ]\n\nII = [ 2, 0 ]\n         [ 0, -2 ]\n\nNow, we can compute the sectional curvature K in the direction of the tangent vectors u and v. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (det(II) / det(I)) = ( (2 * -2) - (0 * 0) ) / ( (5 * 5) - (-2 * -2) ) = -4 / 21\n\nSo, the sectional curvature at the point (1, 1, 0) in the direction of the tangent vectors u = (1, 0, 2) and v = (0, 1, 2) is K = -4/21."
