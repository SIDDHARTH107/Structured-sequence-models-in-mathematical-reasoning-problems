    "message_2": "To prove that A x (B ∩ B) = (A x B) ∩ (A x B), we will show that the two sets have the same elements.\n\nFirst, let's define the Cartesian product A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nNow, let's consider the set B ∩ B. The intersection of a set with itself is the set itself, so B ∩ B = B.\n\nNow we can find A x (B ∩ B):\n\nA x (B ∩ B) = A x B = {(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nNow let's find (A x B) ∩ (A x B):\n\n(A x B) ∩ (A x B) = A x B = {(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, A x (B ∩ B) and (A x B) ∩ (A x B) have the same elements:\n\n{(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nTherefore, A x (B ∩ B) = (A x B) ∩ (A x B)."
