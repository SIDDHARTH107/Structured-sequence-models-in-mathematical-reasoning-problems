    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the Jacobian of the elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, we first need to find the number of points on the elliptic curve itself.\n\nThe equation of the elliptic curve is $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$. We can go through all the possible values of $x$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$ and check if there is a corresponding $y$ value that satisfies the equation.\n\nFor each $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{11}$, we compute $x^3 + 3x + 1$ and check if it is a quadratic residue modulo 11. If it is, then there are two corresponding $y$ values, and if it is not, there are no corresponding $y$ values.\n\nHere is the computation for each $x$:\n\n$x = 0: 0^3 + 3\\cdot0 + 1 = 1$ (quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 1: 1^3 + 3\\cdot1 + 1 = 5$ (quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 2: 2^3 + 3\\cdot2 + 1 = 6$ (not a quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 3: 3^3 + 3\\cdot3 + 1 = 10$ (not a quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 4: 4^3 + 3\\cdot4 + 1 = 8$ (quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 5: 5^3 + 3\\cdot5 + 1 = 7$ (not a quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 6: 6^3 + 3\\cdot6 + 1 = 7$ (not a quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 7: 7^3 + 3\\cdot7 + 1 = 8$ (quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 8: 8^3 + 3\\cdot8 + 1 = 10$ (not a quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 9: 9^3 + 3\\cdot9 + 1 = 6$ (not a quadratic residue)\n\n$x = 10: 10^3 + 3\\cdot10 + 1 = 5$ (quadratic residue)\n\nThere are 5 quadratic residues, and each of them has 2 corresponding $y$ values. So there are 5 * 2 = 10 points on the elliptic curve.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of points on the Jacobian of the elliptic curve. The Jacobian of an elliptic curve over a finite field has the same number of points as the elliptic curve itself, plus one extra point called the point at infinity.\n\nSo the number of points on the Jacobian of the elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$ is 10 + 1 = 11."
