    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Determine the possible divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their properties.\n\nFor a group of order 72, we have the following possibilities for Sylow subgroups:\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroups: There are 1, 3, or 9 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8.\n- Sylow 3-subgroups: There are 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, then both are normal, and the group is a direct product of these two subgroups. In this case, there is only one non-isomorphic group, which is Z_8 × Z_9 (or Z_72).\n\n2. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups, then the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the whole group. There are two possibilities for the action of the Sylow 3-subgroup on the Sylow 2-subgroup, leading to two non-isomorphic groups: Z_8 ⋊ Z_9 and Z_4 × (Z_2 ⋊ Z_9).\n\n3. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 3-subgroup, then the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, and the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the whole group. There are two possibilities for the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup, leading to two non-isomorphic groups: Z_9 ⋊ Z_8 and Z_9 ⋊ (Z_4 × Z_2).\n\n4. If there are nine Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups, then neither of the Sylow subgroups is normal, and the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possibilities for the action of the Sylow 3-subgroup on the Sylow 2-subgroup and two possibilities for the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup, leading to four non-isomorphic groups: (Z_8 ⋊ Z_3) ⋊ Z_3, (Z_4 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_3, (Z_4 × (Z_2 ⋊ Z_3)) ⋊ Z_3, and (Z_2 × (Z_4 ⋊ Z_3)) ⋊ Z_3.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
