    "message_1": "Suppose a researcher wants to investigate the relationship among five variables X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5. After conducting a factor analysis, the researcher found that the five variables can be represented by two factors F1 and F2. The factor loadings for each variable on these factors are shown below:\n\nVariable | F1 | F2\n--- | --- | ---\nX1 | 0.8 | 0.2\nX2 | 0.6 | 0.4\nX3 | 0.1 | 0.9\nX4 | 0.4 | 0.6\nX5 | 0.3 | 0.7\n\nWhat is the percentage of total variance explained by each factor F1 and F2?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of total variance explained by each factor F1 and F2, we first need to calculate the sum of squared factor loadings for each factor.\n\nFor F1:\n(0.8)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (0.1)^2 + (0.4)^2 + (0.3)^2 = 0.64 + 0.36 + 0.01 + 0.16 + 0.09 = 1.26\n\nFor F2:\n(0.2)^2 + (0.4)^2 + (0.9)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (0.7)^2 = 0.04 + 0.16 + 0.81 + 0.36 + 0.49 = 1.86\n\nNow, we need to find the total variance, which is the sum of the variances for F1 and F2:\nTotal variance = 1.26 + 1.86 = 3.12\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage of total variance explained by each factor:\n\nFor F1:\n(1.26 / 3.12) * 100 = 40.38%\n\nFor F2:\n(1.86 / 3.12) * 100 = 59.62%\n\nSo, F1 explains 40.38% of the total variance, and F2 explains 59.62% of the total variance."
