    "message_2": "To find the number of possible keys for a block cipher with a key length of 56 bits, you need to calculate 2 raised to the power of the key length (since there are 2 possibilities for each bit: 0 or 1).\n\nNumber of possible keys = 2^56\n\nCalculating this value:\n\nNumber of possible keys = 72,057,594,037,927,936"
