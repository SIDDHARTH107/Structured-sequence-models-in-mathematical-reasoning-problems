    "message_2": "The probability of an event not occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event occurring. In this case, the probability of rain is 60%, or 0.6. Therefore, the probability of it not raining is:\n\n1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nSo, there is a 40% chance that it will not rain on that day."
