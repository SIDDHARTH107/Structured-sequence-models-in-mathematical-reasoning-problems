    "message_2": "To show that the given algebraic variety is not rational, we will first show that it is smooth and proper, and then show that it does not have a rational point.\n\nThe variety is given by the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - z^2 - 1 = 0.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂/∂x: 2x\n∂/∂y: 2y\n∂/∂z: -2z\n\nThe variety is smooth if the gradient is nonzero at every point on the variety. Since the gradient is (2x, 2y, -2z), it is nonzero unless x = y = z = 0. However, this point does not satisfy the equation of the variety, so the variety is indeed smooth.\n\nNow, let's show that the variety is proper. The variety is given by a homogeneous equation of degree 2, so it is a quadric in the projective space P^2. Quadrics in projective space are always proper, so our variety is proper.\n\nNow, we need to show that the variety does not have a rational point. Suppose there is a rational point (x, y, z) on the variety. Then, we can assume that x, y, and z are coprime integers. The equation of the variety implies that:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = z^2 + 1.\n\nSince x^2 + y^2 is even, z^2 must be odd, so z is odd. Let z = 2m + 1 for some integer m. Then:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = (2m + 1)^2 + 1 = 4m^2 + 4m + 2.\n\nNow, x^2 + y^2 is even, so one of x and y must be even, and the other must be odd. Without loss of generality, let x = 2n and y = 2p + 1 for some integers n and p. Then:\n\n(2n)^2 + (2p + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 2.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n4n^2 + 4p^2 + 4p + 1 = 4m^2 + 4m + 2.\n\nDividing by 2, we have:\n\n2n^2 + 2p^2 + 2p = 2m^2 + 2m.\n\nSince the left side is even, the right side must also be even. However, this implies that m^2 + m is even, which is only possible if m is odd. But then, z = 2m + 1 is even, which contradicts our assumption that z is odd. Therefore, the variety does not have a rational point.\n\nNow, let's use the theory of minimal models of algebraic varieties to find a larger variety that this one can be birationally embedded in. Since our variety is a smooth quadric in P^2, it is isomorphic to the projective plane P^1 x P^1. The minimal model of P^1 x P^1 is P^2, so our variety can be birationally embedded in P^2.\n\nIn conclusion, the given algebraic variety is not rational, as it is smooth, proper, and does not have a rational point. Furthermore, it can be birationally embedded in the projective plane P^2."
