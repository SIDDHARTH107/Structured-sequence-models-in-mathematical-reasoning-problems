    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we first need to find the possible group structures. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. Using the Sylow theorems, we can find the possible Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, there can be 1, 3, or 15 subgroups.\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, there can be 1 or 4 subgroups.\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, there can be 1 or 6 subgroups.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This would result in an abelian group, so it's not a valid option.\n\n2. Three 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This would result in a semi-direct product of Z_4 and Z_15, which is non-abelian. This is a valid option.\n\n3. Fifteen 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This would result in a semi-direct product of Z_2 x Z_2 and Z_15, which is non-abelian. This is a valid option.\n\n4. One 2-Sylow, four 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This would result in an abelian group, so it's not a valid option.\n\n5. Three 2-Sylow, four 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This would result in a semi-direct product of Z_4 and Z_3 x Z_5, which is non-abelian. This is a valid option.\n\n6. Fifteen 2-Sylow, four 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This would result in a semi-direct product of Z_2 x Z_2 and Z_3 x Z_5, which is non-abelian. This is a valid option.\n\n7. One 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This would result in an abelian group, so it's not a valid option.\n\n8. Three 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This would result in an abelian group, so it's not a valid option.\n\n9. Fifteen 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This would result in an abelian group, so it's not a valid option.\n\n10. One 2-Sylow, four 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This would result in an abelian group, so it's not a valid option.\n\n11. Three 2-Sylow, four 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This would result in an abelian group, so it's not a valid option.\n\n12. Fifteen 2-Sylow, four 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This would result in an abelian group, so it's not a valid option.\n\nOut of these 12 possibilities, only 4 of them result in non-abelian groups. Therefore, there are 4 non-abelian groups of order 60."
