    "message_2": "To find the median of the given data set, first, arrange the numbers in ascending order, which has already been done:\n\n6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 22, 50\n\nSince there are 9 numbers in the data set (an odd number), the median will be the middle value. In this case, the median is the 5th number:\n\n6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 22, 50\n\nThe median of this data set is 12."
