    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 2x + 5, we will integrate the function with respect to x.\n\n∫(2x + 5) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\n∫2x dx + ∫5 dx\n\nFor the first term, we have:\n\n(2/2)x^2 + C1 = x^2 + C1\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n\n5x + C2\n\nNow, we will combine the two terms and their constants:\n\nx^2 + 5x + (C1 + C2)\n\nSince C1 and C2 are both constants, we can combine them into a single constant, C:\n\nx^2 + 5x + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 2x + 5 is:\n\nF(x) = x^2 + 5x + C"
