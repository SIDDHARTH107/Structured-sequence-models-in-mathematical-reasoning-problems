    "message_2": "To determine the automorphism group of G, we need to find all the permutations of vertices that preserve the adjacency structure of the graph. In other words, we need to find all the isomorphisms from G to itself.\n\nFirst, let's label the vertices as V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6. The adjacency matrix tells us the following connections:\n\n- V1 is connected to V2 and V5.\n- V2 is connected to V1, V3, and V6.\n- V3 is connected to V2 and V4.\n- V4 is connected to V3, V5, and V6.\n- V5 is connected to V1 and V4.\n- V6 is connected to V2 and V4.\n\nNow, let's find the automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity automorphism: (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6) -> (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6)\n2. Swap V1 and V5, and V3 and V6: (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6) -> (V5, V2, V6, V4, V1, V3)\n3. Swap V2 and V4, and V3 and V5: (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6) -> (V1, V4, V5, V2, V3, V6)\n4. Swap V1 and V5, V2 and V4, and V3 and V6: (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6) -> (V5, V4, V6, V2, V1, V3)\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms that preserve the adjacency structure of the graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is:\n\n{ (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3), (1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6), (5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 3) }"
