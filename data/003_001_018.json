    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 cm and one of the acute angles is 30 degrees. What is the length of the opposite side to the angle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the opposite side to the 30-degree angle, we can use the sine function in the context of right triangles. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nWe are given the angle (30 degrees) and the hypotenuse (10 cm). We can plug these values into the equation and solve for the opposite side.\n\nsin(30) = opposite side / 10\n\nThe sine of 30 degrees is 0.5 (you can find this using a calculator or by knowing the common trigonometric values).\n\n0.5 = opposite side / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the opposite side:\n\nopposite side = 0.5 * 10\nopposite side = 5 cm\n\nSo, the length of the opposite side to the 30-degree angle is 5 cm."
