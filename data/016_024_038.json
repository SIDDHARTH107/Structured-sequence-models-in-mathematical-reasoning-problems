In each subsequent iteration, each square is replaced by 8 smaller squares, but the central square is removed.)",
    "message_2": "To find the number of squares in the nth iteration of the Sierpinski carpet fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nThis formula is derived from the fact that in each iteration, each square is replaced by 8 smaller squares, but the central square is removed. So, in the first iteration, there is 1 square. In the second iteration, there are 8 squares (8 * 1 - 1). In the third iteration, there are 64 squares (8 * 8 - 1), and so on.\n\nSo, for the nth iteration, the number of squares is:\n\nNumber of squares = (8^n - 1) / 7"
