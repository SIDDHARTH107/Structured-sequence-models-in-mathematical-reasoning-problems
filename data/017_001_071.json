Prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nTo solve this problem, the student should provide a detailed proof using the necessary theorems and concepts in group theory to demonstrate that any group of order 4 is isomorphic to either C4 or V4. Additionally, they should explicitly state and explain the underlying properties of these groups that make them unique and isomorphic to G.",
    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, we will consider the possible structures of G and use the properties of group theory to show that these are the only two possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions of C4 and V4:\n\n1. C4 is the cyclic group of order 4, which can be generated by a single element, say a, such that C4 = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element and a^4 = e.\n\n2. V4 is the Klein four-group, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, say C2 and C2', with elements {e, a} and {e, b} respectively. V4 = {e, a, b, ab}, where a^2 = b^2 = e and ab = ba.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 4. By the Sylow theorems, G must have an element of order 2, say a (since 2 divides 4). If G has an element of order 4, say b, then G is generated by b and is isomorphic to C4.\n\nIf G does not have an element of order 4, then all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let G = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c have order 2. Since a has order 2, we have a^2 = e. Similarly, b^2 = e and c^2 = e.\n\nNow, consider the product ab. Since a and b are distinct non-identity elements, ab cannot be equal to a or b. If ab = e, then a = b^(-1), which implies a = b, a contradiction. Therefore, ab must be equal to the remaining element c. Note that (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ee = e, so c also has order 2.\n\nFinally, we have that G = {e, a, b, ab}, where a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e. This shows that G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nIn conclusion, any group G of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
