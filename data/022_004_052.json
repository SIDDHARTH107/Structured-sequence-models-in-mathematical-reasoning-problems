    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the complex function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 + 1), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nSo, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the complex domain. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for z:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1:\n\nz = (± √(-4)) / 2\nz = (± √(4i^2)) / 2\nz = (± 2i) / 2\n\nSo, the two singularities of the complex function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 + 1) are:\n\nz = ± i"
