    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular heptagon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * n * s^2 * cot(π/n)\n\nwhere n is the number of sides, s is the side length, and cot is the cotangent function.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (since it's a heptagon) and s = 8 cm.\n\nFirst, we need to find the cotangent of π/7:\n\ncot(π/7) = 1/tan(π/7) ≈ 2.246\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea ≈ (1/4) * 7 * 8^2 * 2.246\nArea ≈ 1.75 * 64 * 2.246\nArea ≈ 251.04 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the regular heptagon is approximately 251.04 cm^2."
