    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector with a central angle of 60°, we need to calculate the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nThe circumference of the entire circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius. In this case, r = 10 cm, so the circumference of the entire circle is:\n\nC = 2π(10) = 20π cm\n\nNow, we need to find the fraction of the circumference that corresponds to the 60° central angle. Since there are 360° in a circle, the fraction is:\n\n(60°) / (360°) = 1/6\n\nSo, the length of the arc is 1/6 of the circumference:\n\nArc length = (1/6)(20π) = 10π/3 cm\n\nNow, we add the arc length to the two radii to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r = (10π/3) + 2(10) = 10π/3 + 20\n\nNow, we can approximate the value:\n\nPerimeter ≈ (10 * 3.14 / 3) + 20 ≈ 10.47 + 20 ≈ 30.47 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector with a central angle of 60° is approximately 30.47 cm (rounded to two decimal places)."
