If a random sample of 80 apples is taken from the orchard, what is the probability that the average weight of the apples in the sample is between 145 grams and 155 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In this case, we are given that the weights of apples follow a normal distribution with a mean (µ) of 150 grams and a standard deviation (σ) of 20 grams. We have a sample size (n) of 80 apples.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The mean of the sampling distribution (µ_sample) is equal to the population mean (µ), which is 150 grams.\n\nµ_sample = µ = 150 grams\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σ_sample) is equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nσ_sample = σ / √n = 20 / √80 ≈ 2.236\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the average weight of the apples in the sample is between 145 grams and 155 grams. To do this, we need to calculate the z-scores for both 145 grams and 155 grams.\n\nz-score = (x - µ_sample) / σ_sample\n\nFor 145 grams:\n\nz1 = (145 - 150) / 2.236 ≈ -2.236\n\nFor 155 grams:\n\nz2 = (155 - 150) / 2.236 ≈ 2.236\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score falls between -2.236 and 2.236. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the area under the curve between these two z-scores.\n\nP(-2.236 < z < 2.236) ≈ 0.9744\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the apples in the sample is between 145 grams and 155 grams is approximately 97.44%."
