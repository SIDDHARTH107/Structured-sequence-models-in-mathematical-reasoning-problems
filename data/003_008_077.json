    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle between the base and the height. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then using the inverse sine function to find the angle.\n\nLet's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c. We have:\n\na = 12 cm\nb = 8 cm\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = (12 cm)^2 + (8 cm)^2\nc^2 = 144 cm^2 + 64 cm^2\nc^2 = 208 cm^2\nc = √208 cm ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the base and the height using the inverse sine function:\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(angle) = b / c\nsin(angle) = 8 cm / 14.42 cm\nangle = arcsin(8/14.42) ≈ 34.08°\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 12 cm * 8 cm * sin(34.08°)\nArea ≈ 48 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 48 square centimeters."
