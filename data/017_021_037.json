    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the possible structures of a group G of order 48. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there are Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in G. Let's denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups as n_2 and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3.\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 16 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 or 3\n2. n_3 = 1 or 4\n\nCase 1: G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup (n_2 = 1)\n\nIf G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, then G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and its Sylow 3-subgroup. Let P_2 be the Sylow 2-subgroup and P_3 be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are coprime, G is isomorphic to the internal semi-direct product P_2 ⋊ P_3.\n\nP_2 has order 16, so it is either isomorphic to C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C4 × C2 × C2. P_3 has order 3, so it is isomorphic to C3.\n\nNow, we consider the possible semi-direct products:\n\n1. C16 ⋊ C3: This gives us the cyclic group C48.\n2. (C8 × C2) ⋊ C3: This gives us 6 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n3. (C4 × C4) ⋊ C3: This gives us 4 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n4. (C4 × C2 × C2) ⋊ C3: This gives us 4 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 2: G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup (n_3 = 1)\n\nIf G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 3-subgroup and its Sylow 2-subgroup. Let P_2 be the Sylow 2-subgroup and P_3 be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are coprime, G is isomorphic to the internal semi-direct product P_3 ⋊ P_2.\n\nP_3 has order 3, so it is isomorphic to C3. P_2 has order 16, so it is either isomorphic to C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C4 × C2 × C2.\n\nNow, we consider the possible semi-direct products:\n\n1. C3 ⋊ C16: This gives us no new groups.\n2. C3 ⋊ (C8 × C2): This gives us no new groups.\n3. C3 ⋊ (C4 × C4): This gives us the alternating group A4 × C4.\n4. C3 ⋊ (C4 × C2 × C2): This gives us no new groups.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 48 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the specific properties of G."
