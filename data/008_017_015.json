    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be represented as:\n\n```\nA = | 1  2 -3 |\n    | 2  3  1 |\n    | 3  1 -4 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 6 |\n    | 8 |\n    | 2 |\n```\n\nNow, we will convert the matrix A into a sparse matrix representation. Since all the elements in A are non-zero, the sparse matrix representation will be the same as the original matrix A.\n\nNext, we will solve the matrix equation Ax = b using any suitable method, such as Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition. Here, we will use Gaussian elimination.\n\n1. First, we will eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\n```\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n```\n\nThis will give us the following matrix:\n\n```\nA = | 1  2  -3 |\n    | 0 -1   7 |\n    | 0 -5  13 |\n\nb = | 6 |\n    |-4 |\n    |-16|\n```\n\n2. Next, we will eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 - 5 * R2\n```\n\nThis will give us the following matrix:\n\n```\nA = | 1  2  -3 |\n    | 0 -1   7 |\n    | 0  0 -22 |\n\nb = |  6 |\n    | -4 |\n    |  4 |\n```\n\n3. Now, we will perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n```\nz = -b3 / A33 = 4 / -22 = -2/11\ny = (b2 - A32 * z) / A22 = (-4 - 7 * -2/11) / -1 = 10/11\nx = (b1 - A12 * y - A13 * z) / A11 = (6 - 2 * 10/11 + 3 * -2/11) / 1 = 2/11\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 2/11\ny = 10/11\nz = -2/11\n```"
