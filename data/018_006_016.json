    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3}\nUniversal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', contains the elements {4, 5, 6} since these are the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. In this case, we combine the elements of set A and set A':\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nWe can see that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nThis demonstrates that the union of set A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
