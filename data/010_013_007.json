    "message_2": "To find the Chern class of this bundle, we first need to compute the curvature form associated with the given transition function. The curvature form is given by the exterior derivative of the connection 1-form, which is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the transition function:\n\nω = d(log(g(x)))\n\nSince g(x) = exp(2πia(x)), we have:\n\nlog(g(x)) = 2πia(x)\n\nNow, we compute the exterior derivative of the connection 1-form:\n\nω = d(2πia(x))\n\nFor x ≤ 1/2, a(x) = (1-x), so:\n\nω = d(2πi(1-x)) = -2πi dx\n\nFor x ≥ 1/2, a(x) = x, so:\n\nω = d(2πix) = 2πi dx\n\nNow, we integrate the curvature form over the circle to find the Chern class:\n\nc_1 = ∫_circle ω\n\nThe circle can be parameterized by x = t, where t ∈ [0, 1]. We split the integral into two parts, one for x ≤ 1/2 and one for x ≥ 1/2:\n\nc_1 = ∫_0^1/2 (-2πi dt) + ∫_1/2^1 (2πi dt)\n\nc_1 = -2πi(1/2 - 0) + 2πi(1 - 1/2) = -πi + πi = 0\n\nSo, the Chern class of this bundle is 0."
