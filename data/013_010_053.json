    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot model with two firms producing identical products, where the demand is given by P = 200 - Q, where P represents the price per unit, and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. The cost function for each firm is C(q) = 10q, where q is the firm's individual quantity produced. \n\nWhat quantity should each firm produce in order to maximize their profit? What will be the resulting price and profit for each firm?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing quantity for each firm, we first need to find their reaction functions. The profit function for each firm can be written as:\n\nπ(q_i, q_j) = P * q_i - C(q_i) = (200 - Q) * q_i - 10q_i = (200 - (q_i + q_j)) * q_i - 10q_i\n\nwhere π is the profit, q_i is the quantity produced by firm i, q_j is the quantity produced by firm j, and Q = q_i + q_j.\n\nTo find the reaction function for firm i, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to q_i. We'll do this by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q_i and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndπ(q_i, q_j) / dq_i = (200 - 2q_i - q_j) - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for q_i, we get the reaction function for firm i:\n\nq_i = (190 - q_j) / 2\n\nSince the two firms are symmetric, the reaction function for firm j will be the same:\n\nq_j = (190 - q_i) / 2\n\nNow we need to find the Nash equilibrium, which is the point where both firms' reaction functions intersect. To do this, we can substitute one reaction function into the other:\n\nq_i = (190 - ((190 - q_i) / 2)) / 2\n\nSolving for q_i, we get:\n\nq_i = 190/3 ≈ 63.33\n\nSince the firms are symmetric, q_j = q_i:\n\nq_j = 63.33\n\nNow we can find the total quantity produced, Q:\n\nQ = q_i + q_j = 63.33 + 63.33 = 126.66\n\nNext, we can find the resulting price, P:\n\nP = 200 - Q = 200 - 126.66 = 73.34\n\nFinally, we can find the profit for each firm:\n\nπ_i = π_j = (P * q_i) - C(q_i) = (73.34 * 63.33) - (10 * 63.33) ≈ 4011.11\n\nSo, each firm should produce 63.33 units to maximize their profit. The resulting price will be 73.34, and the profit for each firm will be approximately 4011.11."
