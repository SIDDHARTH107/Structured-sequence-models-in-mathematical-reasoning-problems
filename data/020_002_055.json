    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profit per unit of A is $5 and the profit per unit of B is $8. The production process requires two resources, Resource 1 and Resource 2. Each unit of A requires 3 units of Resource 1 and 2 units of Resource 2. Each unit of B requires 2 units of Resource 1 and 4 units of Resource 2. The company has 100 units of Resource 1 and 80 units of Resource 2 available. What is the maximum profit that the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 8y, subject to the constraints of the available resources.\n\nThe constraints are:\n3x + 2y ≤ 100 (Resource 1 constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 80 (Resource 2 constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\ny ≤ (100 - 3x)/2\ny ≤ (80 - 2x)/4\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. y = (100 - 3x)/2\nWhen x = 0, y = 50\nWhen y = 0, x = 100/3 ≈ 33.33\n\n2. y = (80 - 2x)/4\nWhen x = 0, y = 20\nWhen y = 0, x = 40\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 20), (20, 10), and (100/3, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\nP(0, 20) = 5(0) + 8(20) = $160\nP(20, 10) = 5(20) + 8(10) = $180\nP(100/3, 0) = 5(100/3) + 8(0) ≈ $166.67\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (20, 10), where the company produces 20 units of product A and 10 units of product B. The maximum profit is $180."
