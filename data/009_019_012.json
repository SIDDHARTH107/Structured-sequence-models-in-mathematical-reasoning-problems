Find the solution to this equation with initial condition X(0) = 1, over the time interval [0, T], where T = 5.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n\ndX(t) = X(t) dt + 2X(t) dW(t)\n\nwith initial condition X(0) = 1, we can use the technique of applying Ito's lemma. First, let's find a suitable function to apply Ito's lemma. We can try the natural logarithm function, so let Y(t) = ln(X(t)). Now, we will apply Ito's lemma to Y(t).\n\nIto's lemma states that for a function G(t, X(t)), the differential dG(t, X(t)) can be expressed as:\n\ndG(t, X(t)) = (∂G/∂t) dt + (∂G/∂X) dX(t) + (1/2) (∂²G/∂X²) (dX(t))^2\n\nApplying Ito's lemma to Y(t) = ln(X(t)), we have:\n\ndY(t) = (1/X(t)) dX(t) - (1/2) (1/X(t)^2) (dX(t))^2\n\nNow, substitute the given SDE into the equation:\n\ndY(t) = (1/X(t)) (X(t) dt + 2X(t) dW(t)) - (1/2) (1/X(t)^2) (X(t) dt + 2X(t) dW(t))^2\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ndY(t) = dt + 2 dW(t) - (1/2) (2 dW(t))^2\n\nSince (dW(t))^2 = dt, we have:\n\ndY(t) = dt + 2 dW(t) - 2 dt\n\ndY(t) = - dt + 2 dW(t)\n\nNow, integrate both sides over the interval [0, T]:\n\n∫(dY(t)) = ∫(- dt) + ∫(2 dW(t)) from 0 to T\n\nY(T) - Y(0) = -T + 2(W(T) - W(0))\n\nSince Y(t) = ln(X(t)), Y(T) = ln(X(T)) and Y(0) = ln(X(0)) = ln(1) = 0. Also, W(0) = 0. Therefore,\n\nln(X(T)) = -T + 2W(T)\n\nTo find X(T), take the exponential of both sides:\n\nX(T) = e^(-T + 2W(T))\n\nThis is the solution to the given SDE with initial condition X(0) = 1 over the time interval [0, T], where T = 5. Note that the solution is a random variable due to the presence of the Wiener process W(T)."
