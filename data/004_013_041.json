    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company wants to minimize the cost of production of a product. The cost function for producing x units is given by C(x) = 0.1x^3 - 2x^2 + 12x + 8. Find the minimum cost and the corresponding production level.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost and the corresponding production level, we need to find the critical points of the cost function C(x) by taking its first derivative and setting it equal to zero. Then, we will check the second derivative to determine if it is a minimum.\n\n1. Find the first derivative of C(x):\n\nC'(x) = d/dx (0.1x^3 - 2x^2 + 12x + 8)\n\nC'(x) = 0.3x^2 - 4x + 12\n\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0.3x^2 - 4x + 12 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 0.3, b = -4, and c = 12.\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(0.3)(12))) / (2(0.3))\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 14.4)) / 0.6\n\nx = (4 ± √(1.6)) / 0.6\n\nx ≈ 2.1547 or 9.1786\n\n3. Find the second derivative of C(x):\n\nC''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (0.1x^3 - 2x^2 + 12x + 8)\n\nC''(x) = 0.6x - 4\n\n4. Check the sign of the second derivative at each critical point:\n\nC''(2.1547) ≈ 0.6(2.1547) - 4 ≈ -0.9072 (negative)\nC''(9.1786) ≈ 0.6(9.1786) - 4 ≈ 1.5072 (positive)\n\nSince the second derivative is negative at x ≈ 2.1547, this corresponds to a local maximum. The second derivative is positive at x ≈ 9.1786, which corresponds to a local minimum. Therefore, the minimum cost occurs at a production level of approximately 9.1786 units.\n\n5. Find the minimum cost by plugging the production level into the cost function:\n\nC(9.1786) ≈ 0.1(9.1786)^3 - 2(9.1786)^2 + 12(9.1786) + 8 ≈ 52.036\n\nThus, the minimum cost is approximately $52.036, and the corresponding production level is approximately 9.1786 units."
