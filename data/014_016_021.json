What is the resulting encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH IS FUN\" using the Caesar cipher with a shift of 3, we replace each letter with the letter 3 positions ahead in the alphabet. If we reach the end of the alphabet, we wrap around to the beginning. Here's the encryption process:\n\nM -> P\nA -> D\nT -> W\nH -> K\n\nI -> L\nS -> V\n\nF -> I\nU -> X\nN -> Q\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"PDWK LV IXQ\"."
