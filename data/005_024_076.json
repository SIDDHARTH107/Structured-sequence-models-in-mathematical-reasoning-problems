The blood pressure readings were as follows:\n\n120, 135, 128, 150, 143, 132, 124, 136, 129, 141, 131, 142, 124, 136, 141, 130, 139, 133, 121, 144, 139, 132, 137, 126, 140, 128, 147, 131, 123, 129, 136, 138, 133, 127, 146, 131, 142, 124, 136, 141, 130, 139, 133, 121, 144, 139, 132, 137, 126, 140, 128, 147\n\nFind the mean, the median, and the mode blood pressure readings for the patients.",
    "message_2": "To find the mean, median, and mode, we first need to organize the data and find the sum of all the blood pressure readings.\n\nOrganized data:\n120, 121, 121, 123, 124, 124, 124, 126, 126, 127, 128, 128, 128, 129, 129, 130, 130, 131, 131, 131, 132, 132, 132, 133, 133, 133, 135, 136, 136, 136, 137, 137, 138, 139, 139, 139, 140, 140, 141, 141, 141, 142, 142, 143, 144, 144, 146, 147, 147, 150\n\nSum of blood pressure readings: 6780\n\nMean: The mean is the sum of the blood pressure readings divided by the number of readings. There are 50 readings.\n\nMean = 6780 / 50 = 135.6\n\nMedian: The median is the middle value in the organized data. Since there are 50 readings (an even number), the median will be the average of the 25th and 26th values.\n\nMedian = (132 + 133) / 2 = 132.5\n\nMode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data. In this case, there are three values that appear most frequently (3 times each): 124, 128, and 136.\n\nMode = 124, 128, 136\n\nSo, the mean blood pressure reading is 135.6, the median is 132.5, and the mode is 124, 128, and 136."
