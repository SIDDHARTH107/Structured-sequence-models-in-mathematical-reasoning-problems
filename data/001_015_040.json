    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation $3^{2x-1} = 27$, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite 27 as a power of 3.\nSince $27 = 3^3$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$3^{2x-1} = 3^3$\n\nStep 2: Set the exponents equal to each other.\nSince the bases are equal (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n$2x - 1 = 3$\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nAdd 1 to both sides of the equation:\n$2x = 4$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n$x = 2$\n\nSo, the solution is $x = 2$."
