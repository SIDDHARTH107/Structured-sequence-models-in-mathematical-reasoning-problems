    "message_2": "To find the intersection of a set A and its complement, we first need to understand what the complement of a set is. The complement of a set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements that are not in set A but are in the universal set U. The universal set U contains all possible elements under consideration.\n\nIn this case, we are not given a specific universal set, so we cannot list the elements of the complement of A. However, we can still determine the intersection of A and its complement.\n\nBy definition, the intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets. Since the complement of A contains all the elements that are not in A, there cannot be any elements that are common to both A and its complement.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of A and its complement is an empty set, denoted as âˆ… or {}."
