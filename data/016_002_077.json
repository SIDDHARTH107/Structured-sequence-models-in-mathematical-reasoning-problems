    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is created by adding a Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The length of the Koch curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nKoch curve length = (4^n * original side length) / (3^n)\n\nFor the Koch snowflake, there are three sides, so the total length of the snowflake after n iterations is:\n\nKoch snowflake length = 3 * Koch curve length\n\nLet's calculate the total length of the Koch snowflake after 4 iterations:\n\nKoch curve length after 4 iterations = (4^4 * 5) / (3^4) = (256 * 5) / 81 ≈ 15.8025 cm\n\nKoch snowflake length after 4 iterations = 3 * 15.8025 ≈ 47.4075 cm\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after 4 iterations with an original equilateral triangle side length of 5 cm is approximately 47.4075 cm."
