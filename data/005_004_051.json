The store owner would like to know if there is any significant difference among the average weight of each brand of cereal. For this, she randomly selects 5 boxes of each brand of cereal and weighs them. The weight of each box is given in the following table. Can you help the store owner to determine if there is any significant difference among the average weight of each brand of cereal? Use ANOVA.\n\n| Brand 1  | Brand 2 | Brand 3 |\n| :------:| :-----:| :-----:|\n| 8.3     |  7.6   | 6.8    |\n| 8.5     |  7.1   | 6.7    |\n| 8.0     |  8.0   | 6.4    |\n| 9.2     |  7.8   | 6.9    |\n| 8.8     |  7.4   | 6.5    |",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is any significant difference among the average weight of each brand of cereal, we will perform a one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) test. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the means and variances for each brand:\n\nBrand 1: Mean = (8.3 + 8.5 + 8.0 + 9.2 + 8.8) / 5 = 8.56\nBrand 2: Mean = (7.6 + 7.1 + 8.0 + 7.8 + 7.4) / 5 = 7.58\nBrand 3: Mean = (6.8 + 6.7 + 6.4 + 6.9 + 6.5) / 5 = 6.66\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall mean:\n\nOverall Mean = (8.56 + 7.58 + 6.66) / 3 = 7.6\n\nNext, we will calculate the Sum of Squares Between (SSB), Sum of Squares Within (SSW), and the total Sum of Squares (SST):\n\nSSB = Σ(n_i * (mean_i - overall_mean)^2)\nSSB = 5 * ((8.56 - 7.6)^2 + (7.58 - 7.6)^2 + (6.66 - 7.6)^2) = 23.042\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - mean_i)^2\nSSW = (8.3 - 8.56)^2 + ... + (6.5 - 6.66)^2 = 4.922\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 23.042 + 4.922 = 27.964\n\nNow, we will calculate the degrees of freedom:\n\ndf_between = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\ndf_within = N - k = 15 - 3 = 12\ndf_total = N - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14\n\nNext, we will calculate the Mean Squares Between (MSB) and Mean Squares Within (MSW):\n\nMSB = SSB / df_between = 23.042 / 2 = 11.521\nMSW = SSW / df_within = 4.922 / 12 = 0.410\n\nNow, we will calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 11.521 / 0.410 = 28.098\n\nFinally, we will compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table at a chosen significance level (e.g., α = 0.05). For df_between = 2 and df_within = 12, the critical value is approximately 3.89.\n\nSince our F-statistic (28.098) is greater than the critical value (3.89), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference among the average weight of each brand of cereal. Therefore, there is a significant difference among the average weight of the three brands of cereal."
