    "message_2": "In the given undirected graph:\n\n```\n1---2---3\n|   |   |\n4---5---6\n```\n\nA cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In this graph, the cut vertices are:\n\n- Vertex 2: If we remove vertex 2, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 4, 5} and {3, 6}.\n- Vertex 5: If we remove vertex 5, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3} and {4, 6}.\n\nA bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In this graph, there are no bridges, as removing any single edge does not disconnect the graph."
