    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (z^5 - 2z^4 + 5z^3 - 6z^2 + 11z - 10) / (z^2 - 2z + 1) at the pole z = 1, we first need to simplify the function.\n\nNotice that the denominator (z^2 - 2z + 1) can be factored as (z - 1)^2. Now, we need to find a function g(z) such that f(z) = g(z) * (z - 1)^2. To do this, we can perform polynomial long division or synthetic division.\n\nDividing the numerator by (z - 1)^2, we get:\n\ng(z) = z^3 + z^2 + 3z + 10\n\nNow, we can find the residue of f(z) at z = 1 by evaluating g(z) at z = 1:\n\ng(1) = 1^3 + 1^2 + 3(1) + 10 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 10 = 15\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z = 1 is 15."
