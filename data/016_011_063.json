    "message_2": "The Vicsek Fractal is a self-replicating fractal that is formed by dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the center square, then repeating this process for each of the remaining squares. The area of the fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (Initial Area) * (Number of squares added per iteration)^(iteration number) / (Total number of squares per iteration)^(iteration number)\n\nFor the Vicsek Fractal, the number of squares added per iteration is 4, and the total number of squares per iteration is 9. So, for the seventh iteration, the formula becomes:\n\nArea = (1) * (4^7) / (9^7)\n\nArea = 16384 / 4782969\n\nArea â‰ˆ 0.003425 (rounded to 6 decimal places)\n\nSo, the area of the seventh iteration of the Vicsek Fractal with an original square side length of 1 unit is approximately 0.003425 square units."
