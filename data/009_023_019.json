    "message_2": "To find the value of $A$ such that the norm of $\\psi$ remains constant over time, we first need to compute the norm of $\\psi$. The norm of $\\psi$ is given by:\n\n$$N = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\psi(x,t)|^2 dx$$\n\nSince we are given the initial condition $\\psi(x,0) = A e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$, we can compute the norm at $t=0$:\n\n$$N_0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\psi(x,0)|^2 dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |A e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}}|^2 dx$$\n\n$$N_0 = A^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^2}} dx$$\n\nNow, we can make a substitution $u = \\frac{x}{\\sigma}$, so $x = u\\sigma$ and $dx = \\sigma du$. The integral becomes:\n\n$$N_0 = A^2 \\sigma \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-u^2} du$$\n\nThe integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-u^2} du$ is a well-known Gaussian integral, and its value is $\\sqrt{\\pi}$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$N_0 = A^2 \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}$$\n\nNow, we want the norm $N$ to remain constant over time. This means that $N(t) = N_0$ for all $t$. Since $N_0$ depends on $A$ and $\\sigma$, we can find the value of $A$ that satisfies this requirement by setting $N(t) = N_0$:\n\n$$A^2 \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi} = N(t)$$\n\nWe are given that the norm remains constant over time, so we can write:\n\n$$A^2 \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi} = N_0$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $A$:\n\n$$A = \\sqrt{\\frac{N_0}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}}}$$\n\nThis is the value of $A$ that satisfies the requirement that the norm of $\\psi$ remains constant over time."
