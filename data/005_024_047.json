    "message_1": "A company conducted a survey of 1000 adults to determine how many cups of coffee they drank daily. The results showed that the mean number of cups per day was 3.5 with a standard deviation of 1.2 cups. \n\nIf a random sample of 50 adults is selected, what is the probability that their mean number of cups of coffee consumed daily is between 3.2 and 3.8 cups?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the mean number of cups of coffee consumed daily is between 3.2 and 3.8 cups, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the information, we have:\n\nPopulation mean (μ) = 3.5 cups\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 1.2 cups\nSample size (n) = 50 adults\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The formula for the standard error is:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 1.2 / √50 ≈ 0.1697\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the range (3.2 and 3.8 cups) using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower bound (3.2 cups):\n\nz_lower = (3.2 - 3.5) / 0.1697 ≈ -1.77\n\nFor the upper bound (3.8 cups):\n\nz_upper = (3.8 - 3.5) / 0.1697 ≈ 1.77\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability between these z-scores. The probability of a z-score being between -1.77 and 1.77 is approximately 0.9236.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the mean number of cups of coffee consumed daily is between 3.2 and 3.8 cups for a random sample of 50 adults is approximately 92.36%."
