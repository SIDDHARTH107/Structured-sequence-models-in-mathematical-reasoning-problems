    "message_2": "To find the local minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 1 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 1) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the root of the first derivative, which will give us the critical points. The formula for Newton's method is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nWe also need the second derivative of f(x) to apply Newton's method:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 4x + 1) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method with an initial guess of x0 = 0.5:\n\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0)\nx1 = 0.5 - (3(0.5)^2 - 4(0.5) + 1) / (6(0.5) - 4)\nx1 = 0.5 - (0.5) / (1)\nx1 = 0.5 - 0.5\nx1 = 0\n\nNow, we will iterate until we reach the desired accuracy of 4 decimal places:\n\nx2 = x1 - f'(x1) / f''(x1)\nx2 = 0 - (3(0)^2 - 4(0) + 1) / (6(0) - 4)\nx2 = 0 - (1) / (-4)\nx2 = 0.25\n\nSince x2 = 0.2500 is accurate to 4 decimal places, we can stop here. The critical point is x = 0.2500. Now, we need to check if this critical point corresponds to a local minimum. We can do this by checking the sign of the second derivative at this point:\n\nf''(0.2500) = 6(0.2500) - 4 = 1.5 - 4 = -2.5\n\nSince f''(0.2500) < 0, the critical point x = 0.2500 corresponds to a local maximum, not a local minimum. Therefore, there is no local minimum value of f(x) using Newton's method with an initial guess of x0 = 0.5, correct to 4 decimal places."
