    "message_2": "To find the number of points that lie on the curve over the field of real numbers, we need to analyze the given equation: $y^2 = x^3 - x^2$. \n\nFirst, let's factor out an x^2 term from the right side of the equation:\n\n$y^2 = x^2(x - 1)$\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of x:\n\n1. If x = 0, then $y^2 = 0$, which means y = 0. So, we have one point (0, 0) on the curve.\n\n2. If x = 1, then $y^2 = 0$, which means y = 0. So, we have another point (1, 0) on the curve.\n\n3. If x > 1, then (x - 1) > 0, and since x^2 is always positive for x ≠ 0, the right side of the equation will be positive. Therefore, y^2 will be positive, and there will be two distinct real values of y for each x > 1.\n\n4. If 0 < x < 1, then (x - 1) < 0, and since x^2 is always positive for x ≠ 0, the right side of the equation will be negative. However, y^2 cannot be negative, so there are no real points on the curve in this interval.\n\nSo, for every x > 1, there are two points on the curve, and there are two points when x is either 0 or 1. Since there are infinitely many real numbers greater than 1, there are infinitely many points on the curve over the field of real numbers."
