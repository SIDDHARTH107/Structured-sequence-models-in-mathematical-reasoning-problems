    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the resulting wave, we first need to express the sine wave and the square wave in terms of their Fourier series representation.\n\nThe sine wave can be represented as:\ns(t) = 5 * sin(2 * π * 100 * t)\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a square wave with frequency f and amplitude A is given by:\nx(t) = (4 * A / π) * Σ [sin((2 * n - 1) * 2 * π * f * t) / (2 * n - 1)]\n\nFor our square wave with frequency 400 Hz and amplitude 2 volts, the Fourier series representation is:\nx(t) = (8 / π) * Σ [sin((2 * n - 1) * 2 * π * 400 * t) / (2 * n - 1)]\n\nNow, we add the sine wave and the square wave to get the resulting wave:\ny(t) = s(t) + x(t)\ny(t) = 5 * sin(2 * π * 100 * t) + (8 / π) * Σ [sin((2 * n - 1) * 2 * π * 400 * t) / (2 * n - 1)]\n\nTo find the Fourier transform of y(t), we can simply find the Fourier transform of each term in the sum and then add them together.\n\nThe Fourier transform of the sine wave is:\nS(f) = (5/2) * [δ(f - 100) - δ(f + 100)]\n\nThe Fourier transform of the square wave can be found by taking the Fourier transform of each term in the Fourier series representation:\nX(f) = (8 / π) * Σ [(1 / (2 * n - 1)) * (δ(f - 400 * (2 * n - 1)) - δ(f + 400 * (2 * n - 1)))]\n\nNow, we add the Fourier transforms of the sine wave and the square wave to get the Fourier transform of the resulting wave:\nY(f) = S(f) + X(f)\nY(f) = (5/2) * [δ(f - 100) - δ(f + 100)] + (8 / π) * Σ [(1 / (2 * n - 1)) * (δ(f - 400 * (2 * n - 1)) - δ(f + 400 * (2 * n - 1)))]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the resulting wave."
