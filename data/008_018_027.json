    "message_2": "First, let's add the block matrices together:\n\n(3  4 | 20)   (2  1 | 11)   (1  0 | 3)\n(1 -2 |  4) + (4  3 | 30) + (0  1 | 2)\n\nThis results in:\n\n(3+2+1  4+1+0 | 20+11+3)\n(1+4+0 -2+3+1 |  4+30+2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(6  5 | 34)\n(5  2 | 36)\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n6x + 5y = 34\n5x + 2y = 36\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by -5 to eliminate the x variable:\n\n12x + 10y = 68\n-25x - 10y = -180\n\nNow, add the two equations together:\n\n(12x - 25x) + (10y - 10y) = 68 - 180\n-13x = -112\n\nNow, divide by -13:\n\nx = 112 / 13\nx = 8.615384615384615\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into one of the original equations, for example, the first equation:\n\n6(8.615384615384615) + 5y = 34\n\n51.69230769230769 + 5y = 34\n\nNow, subtract 51.69230769230769 from both sides:\n\n5y = -17.69230769230769\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\ny = -3.538461538461538\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 8.615384615384615\ny = -3.538461538461538"
