    "message_2": "To unknot the trefoil knot, you need to perform at least three crossing changes. A crossing change is when you change the over-under relationship at a crossing. In the trefoil knot, there are three crossings, and each one needs to be changed to obtain an unknot.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. Start with the trefoil knot.\n2. Change the first crossing: This will result in a \"figure-eight\" knot, which is still knotted.\n3. Change the second crossing: This will result in a \"twist knot\" with two crossings, which is still knotted.\n4. Change the third crossing: This will finally result in an unknot, which is a simple loop without any crossings.\n\nSo, the minimum number of crossing changes needed to unknot the trefoil knot is 3."
