    "message_2": "A columnar transposition with five columns means that there are five distinct columns that can be rearranged in different ways. To find the total number of possible ways that the columns could have been rearranged during encryption, we need to find the number of permutations of these five columns.\n\nThe number of permutations of n objects is given by the formula n! (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (the number of columns), so the total number of possible ways to rearrange the columns is:\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nSo there are 120 possible ways that the columns could have been rearranged during encryption."
