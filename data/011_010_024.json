    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to seat the six people on the seven benches without any restrictions. This is simply a combination problem: C(7,6) = 7!/(6!1!) = 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where at least one pair of people are sitting on adjacent benches. There are 6 pairs of adjacent benches, and for each pair, there are C(5,4) ways to seat the remaining four people on the remaining five benches. So, there are 6 * C(5,4) = 6 * 5 = 30 ways for at least one pair of people to sit on adjacent benches.\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the cases where two pairs of people are sitting on adjacent benches. There are two ways this can happen: either the two pairs are separated by one bench, or they are all sitting consecutively. In the first case, there are 4 ways to arrange the pairs, and in the second case, there are 3 ways. So, there are 4 + 3 = 7 ways for two pairs of people to sit on adjacent benches.\n\nNow, we can apply the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the number of ways to seat the six people without any pairs sitting on adjacent benches:\n\nTotal ways - Ways with at least one pair + Ways with two pairs = 7 - 30 + 7 = -16 + 14 = -2\n\nHowever, since the number of ways cannot be negative, we have made an error in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the problem.\n\nWe can use a recursive approach to solve this problem. Let f(n, k) be the number of ways to seat k people on n benches such that no two people sit on the same bench or adjacent benches. We can express f(n, k) as follows:\n\nf(n, k) = f(n-1, k-1) + f(n-2, k-1)\n\nThe first term represents the case where the first bench is occupied, and the second term represents the case where the first bench is unoccupied. The base cases are:\n\nf(1, 1) = 1 (one person can sit on the only bench)\nf(2, 1) = 2 (one person can sit on either of the two benches)\nf(2, 2) = 0 (two people cannot sit on two benches without being adjacent)\n\nNow, we can compute f(7, 6) using the recursive formula:\n\nf(7, 6) = f(6, 5) + f(5, 5)\n\nf(6, 5) = f(5, 4) + f(4, 4)\nf(5, 4) = f(4, 3) + f(3, 3)\nf(4, 3) = f(3, 2) + f(2, 2)\nf(3, 2) = f(2, 1) + f(1, 1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nf(4, 4) = 0 (four people cannot sit on four benches without being adjacent)\nf(3, 3) = 0 (three people cannot sit on three benches without being adjacent)\n\nSo, f(5, 4) = f(4, 3) + f(3, 3) = 3 + 0 = 3\n\nf(6, 5) = f(5, 4) + f(4, 4) = 3 + 0 = 3\n\nf(5, 5) = 0 (five people cannot sit on five benches without being adjacent)\n\nFinally, f(7, 6) = f(6, 5) + f(5, 5) = 3 + 0 = 3\n\nThere are 3 ways to seat six people on seven benches such that no two people sit on the same bench or adjacent benches."
