    "message_2": "To find the projection of the boat's velocity onto the direction of the water currents, we can use the formula for the scalar projection of one vector onto another. In this case, the boat's velocity vector is V_boat = (0, 15) m/s (since it's moving north), and the water current's velocity vector is V_current = (9, 0) m/s (since it's moving east).\n\nThe scalar projection of V_boat onto V_current is given by:\n\nprojection = (V_boat • V_current) / ||V_current||\n\nwhere \"•\" denotes the dot product, and \"|| ||\" denotes the magnitude of a vector.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of V_boat and V_current:\n\nV_boat • V_current = (0 * 9) + (15 * 0) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of V_current:\n\n||V_current|| = √(9^2 + 0^2) = √81 = 9\n\nNow, we can find the projection:\n\nprojection = (0) / (9) = 0\n\nSo, the projection of the boat's velocity onto the direction of the water currents is 0 m/s. This makes sense because the boat is moving perpendicular to the direction of the water currents, so there is no component of its velocity in the eastward direction."
