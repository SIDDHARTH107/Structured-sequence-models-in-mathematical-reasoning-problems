    "message_1": "A company is testing a new brand of detergent to see if it works as well as their old brand. They randomly selected 50 households and gave them the new detergent to use for one month. They recorded how many loads of laundry were done in each household and how many of those loads came out completely clean. The mean number of loads of laundry done per household was 25 with a standard deviation of 5. The mean number of completely clean loads was 23 with a standard deviation of 7. Can the company conclude that the new detergent works better than the old one? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the new detergent works better than the old one, we can perform a hypothesis test. Let's define the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1):\n\nH0: The new detergent works the same as the old one (μ1 = μ2)\nH1: The new detergent works better than the old one (μ1 > μ2)\n\nHere, μ1 represents the mean number of completely clean loads with the new detergent, and μ2 represents the mean number of completely clean loads with the old detergent.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Sample size (n) = 50 households\n- Mean number of loads of laundry done per household (x̄) = 25\n- Standard deviation of loads of laundry done per household (σx) = 5\n- Mean number of completely clean loads (ȳ) = 23\n- Standard deviation of completely clean loads (σy) = 7\n\nSince we don't have information about the old detergent, we cannot perform a direct comparison between the two detergents. However, we can analyze the proportion of completely clean loads for the new detergent and compare it to a benchmark value.\n\nLet's calculate the proportion of completely clean loads for the new detergent:\n\nProportion of completely clean loads (p) = ȳ / x̄ = 23 / 25 = 0.92\n\nNow, let's assume that the old detergent has a benchmark proportion of completely clean loads (p0). If the new detergent's proportion of completely clean loads (p) is significantly greater than the benchmark proportion (p0), we can conclude that the new detergent works better than the old one.\n\nTo perform the hypothesis test, we can use the z-test for proportions:\n\nz = (p - p0) / sqrt((p0 * (1 - p0)) / n)\n\nWe don't have the value of p0, so we cannot perform the z-test and draw a conclusion about the new detergent's performance compared to the old one. The company needs to provide more information about the old detergent's performance to make a valid comparison."
