    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius of the cylinder is 5 cm, the area of one circular base is:\n\nA = π(5^2) = 25π square centimeters\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n\n2 * 25π = 50π square centimeters\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. The radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm, so the lateral surface area is:\n\nA = 2π(5)(10) = 100π square centimeters\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area by adding the area of the bases and the lateral surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 50π + 100π = 150π square centimeters"
