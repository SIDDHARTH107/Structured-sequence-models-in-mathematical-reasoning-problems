    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x), we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will give us the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nf(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 2\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 2)\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 12x + 10\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 1:\nf''(1) = 36(1)^2 - 12(1) + 10\nf''(1) = 36 - 12 + 10\nf''(1) = 34\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) at x = 1 is 34."
