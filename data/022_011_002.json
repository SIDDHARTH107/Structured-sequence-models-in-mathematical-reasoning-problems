    "message_2": "To find the number of simple zeros and poles of f(z) in the extended complex plane, we need to analyze the factors in the numerator and the denominator.\n\nFirst, let's look at the zeros of f(z), which are the solutions to the equation f(z) = 0. The zeros come from the factors in the numerator:\n\n1. (z^2 - 1) = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation, and it has two distinct solutions: z = 1 and z = -1. These are both simple zeros since the exponent of the factor is 1.\n\n2. (z - 2 - i)^3 = 0\nThis is a cubic equation, and it has one solution: z = 2 + i. This is a simple zero since the exponent of the factor is 3, which is an odd number.\n\nNow, let's look at the poles of f(z), which are the solutions to the equation in the denominator:\n\n1. (z + 1 + i)^2 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation, and it has one solution: z = -1 - i. This is a simple pole since the exponent of the factor is 2, which is an even number.\n\nIn summary, f(z) has 3 simple zeros (1, -1, and 2 + i) and 1 simple pole (-1 - i) in the extended complex plane."
