    "message_2": "To find the adjacent side of the right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, we have:\n\nHypotenuse^2 = Opposite^2 + Adjacent^2\n\nWe are given the hypotenuse (10 cm) and the opposite side (8 cm). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n10^2 = 8^2 + Adjacent^2\n100 = 64 + Adjacent^2\n\nNow, we can solve for the adjacent side:\n\nAdjacent^2 = 100 - 64\nAdjacent^2 = 36\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nAdjacent = âˆš36\nAdjacent = 6 cm\n\nSo, the adjacent side of the triangle is 6 cm."
