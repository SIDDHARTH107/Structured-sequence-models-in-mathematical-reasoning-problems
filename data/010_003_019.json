Prove that there exist two disjoint open sets U, V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nNote: The above problem requires the use of the T4 axiom and is a fundamental result in the field of topology.",
    "message_2": "To prove that there exist two disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V, we will use the T4 axiom (also known as the normality axiom). A topological space X is said to be normal (T4) if, given any two disjoint closed subsets A and B, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nSince A and B are both closed and do not intersect, they are disjoint closed subsets of X. By the T4 axiom, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nThus, we have shown that for a topological space X and closed, non-intersecting subsets A and B, there exist two disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. This is a fundamental result in the field of topology and demonstrates the power of the separation axioms in understanding the structure of topological spaces."
