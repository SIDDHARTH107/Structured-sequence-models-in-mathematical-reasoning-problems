    "message_1": "Consider a one-dimensional heat transfer problem where a rod of length 1 meter has an initial temperature distribution given by f(x) = x(1-x) and is insulated on both ends. Using the Fourier transform, determine the temperature distribution u(x,t) at time t = 0.5 seconds if the thermal diffusivity of the rod is 0.2 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Fourier series method. First, we need to find the Fourier coefficients for the given initial temperature distribution f(x) = x(1-x). Since the rod is insulated on both ends, we will use the sine series representation:\n\nf(x) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L (L = 1 m in this case).\n\nLet's find B_n:\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫[x(1-x) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x(1-x), dv = sin(nπx) dx\ndu = (1-2x) dx, v = -cos(nπx) / (nπ)\n\nNow, using integration by parts:\n\n∫[u dv] = uv - ∫[v du]\n= -x(1-x)cos(nπx) / (nπ) - ∫[-cos(nπx) * (1-2x) dx / (nπ)] from 0 to 1\n\nLet's perform integration by parts again:\n\nu2 = (1-2x), dv2 = -cos(nπx) dx / (nπ)\ndu2 = -2 dx, v2 = -sin(nπx) / (n²π²)\n\nNow, using integration by parts:\n\n∫[u2 dv2] = u2v2 - ∫[v2 du2]\n= -(1-2x)sin(nπx) / (n²π²) - ∫[2sin(nπx) dx / (n²π²)] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining term:\n\n∫[2sin(nπx) dx / (n²π²)] = -cos(nπx) / (n³π³) from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expression for B_n:\n\nB_n = -x(1-x)cos(nπx) / (nπ) + (1-2x)sin(nπx) / (n²π²) + cos(nπx) / (n³π³) from 0 to 1\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nB_n = (1/n³π³) - (1/nπ) - (1/n²π²) + (2/n³π³)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier coefficients B_n. The temperature distribution u(x,t) can be found using the following formula:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx) * exp(-n²π²αt)]\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity (0.2 m²/s in this case) and t is the time (0.5 seconds).\n\nSo, for t = 0.5 seconds:\n\nu(x,0.5) = ∑[(1/n³π³) - (1/nπ) - (1/n²π²) + (2/n³π³)] * sin(nπx) * exp(-n²π² * 0.2 * 0.5)\n\nThis is an infinite series, and we can approximate the solution by taking the first few terms of the series. The more terms we take, the more accurate our approximation will be."
