    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative polynomial ring $R = \\mathbb{C}\\langle x,y \\rangle/(yx-xy-1),$ where $\\mathbb{C}$ denotes the field of complex numbers. Let $M$ be the left $R$-module generated by $v$ satisfying $xv = 0$ and $yv = v.$ Find the dimension of $M$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}.$",
    "message_2": "Let's first analyze the relations in the module $M$. We have $xv = 0$ and $yv = v$. Since $M$ is generated by $v$, any element in $M$ can be written as a linear combination of elements of the form $r v$, where $r \\in R$. We can write $r$ as a polynomial in $x$ and $y$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{C}$. \n\nNow, let's consider the action of $x$ and $y$ on $v$. Since $xv = 0$, any term in $r$ containing $x$ will vanish when acting on $v$. Therefore, we can restrict our attention to polynomials in $y$ only. \n\nLet $r(y) = c_0 + c_1 y + c_2 y^2 + \\cdots + c_n y^n$ be a polynomial in $y$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{C}$. Then, $r(y)v = (c_0 + c_1 y + c_2 y^2 + \\cdots + c_n y^n)v = c_0 v + c_1 yv + c_2 y^2v + \\cdots + c_n y^nv$. \n\nUsing the relation $yv = v$, we can simplify this expression: $r(y)v = c_0 v + c_1 v + c_2 v + \\cdots + c_n v = (c_0 + c_1 + c_2 + \\cdots + c_n) v$. \n\nThus, any element in $M$ can be written as a linear combination of the form $(c_0 + c_1 + c_2 + \\cdots + c_n) v$, where $c_i \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This means that $M$ is a one-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$, with basis $\\{v\\}$. \n\nSo, the dimension of $M$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$ is 1."
