    "message_2": "To show that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C), we need to show that the elements in both Cartesian products are the same. \n\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n(A × B) = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\n(B × C) = {(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × C and A × (B × C):\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 4), 7), ((1, 5), 6), ((1, 5), 7), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 4), 7), ((2, 5), 6), ((2, 5), 7), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 4), 7), ((3, 5), 6), ((3, 5), 7)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (4, 7)), (1, (5, 6)), (1, (5, 7)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (4, 7)), (2, (5, 6)), (2, (5, 7)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (4, 7)), (3, (5, 6)), (3, (5, 7))}\n\nNow, we can rewrite the elements of (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) in a more comparable form:\n\n(A × B) × C = {(1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 7), (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7), (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 6), (3, 5, 7)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 7), (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7), (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 6), (3, 5, 7)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements in both Cartesian products are the same.
