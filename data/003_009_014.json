    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the lengths of all three sides. We are given the base (10 cm) and one angle (30 degrees). Since it's a right triangle, the other angle is 90 - 30 = 60 degrees.\n\nWe can use the sine function to find the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle (let's call it side a):\nsin(30) = a / hypotenuse\n\nWe can also use the cosine function to find the length of the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle (the base, which is 10 cm):\ncos(30) = base / hypotenuse\n\nFirst, let's find the length of side a:\nsin(30) = 1/2, so\n1/2 = a / hypotenuse\na = (1/2) * hypotenuse\n\nNow let's find the hypotenuse using the cosine function:\ncos(30) = sqrt(3)/2, so\nsqrt(3)/2 = 10 / hypotenuse\nhypotenuse = 10 / (sqrt(3)/2)\nhypotenuse = 20 / sqrt(3)\nhypotenuse ≈ 11.547 cm\n\nNow we can find the length of side a:\na = (1/2) * 11.547\na ≈ 5.774 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter by adding the lengths of all three sides:\nperimeter = base + a + hypotenuse\nperimeter = 10 + 5.774 + 11.547\nperimeter ≈ 27.321 cm"
