    "message_1": "A company's network has 8 servers, each with a 5% chance of being affected by a malware attack. What is the probability that exactly 4 servers will be affected by the attack?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, servers being affected by the attack)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials (in this case, choosing 4 affected servers from 8 total servers)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 8 servers)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 4 affected servers)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 5% or 0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 95% or 0.95)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(8, 4), which is the number of ways to choose 4 affected servers from 8 total servers. We can use the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * 4!)\nC(8, 4) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\nC(8, 4) = 40320 / (24 * 24)\nC(8, 4) = 40320 / 576\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nNow we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = C(8, 4) * 0.05^4 * 0.95^4\nP(X = 4) = 70 * 0.05^4 * 0.95^4\nP(X = 4) â‰ˆ 0.2182\n\nSo the probability that exactly 4 servers will be affected by the attack is approximately 21.82%."
