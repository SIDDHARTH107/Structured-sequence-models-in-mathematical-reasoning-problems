    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to H, we need to find a bijection (one-to-one and onto function) between the vertices of G and H that preserves adjacency. In other words, we need to find a permutation of the vertices of G that results in the same adjacency matrix as H.\n\nLet's first analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs:\n\nFor graph G:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 2\n- Vertex 2 has degree 3\n- Vertex 3 has degree 2\n- Vertex 4 has degree 3\n- Vertex 5 has degree 2\n- Vertex 6 has degree 2\n\nFor graph H:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 3\n- Vertex 2 has degree 3\n- Vertex 3 has degree 3\n- Vertex 4 has degree 3\n- Vertex 5 has degree 3\n- Vertex 6 has degree 3\n\nWe can see that the degree sequences of G and H are different. In graph G, there are four vertices with degree 2 and two vertices with degree 3. In graph H, all vertices have degree 3.\n\nSince the degree sequences are not the same, the graphs G and H cannot be isomorphic."
