    "message_2": "To determine if X is compact, we need to check if it is both closed and bounded.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the subsets of X:\n\n1. A = { (x,y) | x^2 + y^2 <= 1 }: This is the set of all points (x,y) inside and on the circle with center (0,0) and radius 1. This set is closed because it contains its boundary (the circle itself) and is bounded by the circle.\n\n2. B = { (x,y) | (x-1)^2 + y^2 < 1 }: This is the set of all points (x,y) strictly inside the circle with center (1,0) and radius 1. This set is open because it does not contain its boundary (the circle itself) and is bounded by the circle.\n\n3. C = { (x,y) | (x+1)^2 + y^2 < 1 }: This is the set of all points (x,y) strictly inside the circle with center (-1,0) and radius 1. This set is open because it does not contain its boundary (the circle itself) and is bounded by the circle.\n\nNow, let's analyze the union of these sets:\n\nX = A ∪ B ∪ C\n\nSince A is closed and bounded, and both B and C are open and bounded, we can see that X is bounded. However, X is not closed because the union of a closed set with open sets does not guarantee a closed set. In this case, the boundaries of B and C are not included in X, so X is not closed.\n\nTherefore, X is not compact because it is not closed, even though it is bounded."
