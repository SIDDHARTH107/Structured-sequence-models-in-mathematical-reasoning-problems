    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 3x + 7y = 25 for positive integers x and y, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the general solution and then find the specific positive integer solutions.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 3 and 7 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n7 = 2 * 3 + 1\n3 = 1 * 1 + 0\n\nSo, gcd(3, 7) = 1.\n\nNow, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients that satisfy the equation:\n\n1 = 7 - 2 * 3\n\nSo, 1 = 7 * 1 - 3 * 2.\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the equation by 25 to get:\n\n25 = 7 * 25 - 3 * 50\n\nSo, 25 = 7 * 25 - 3 * 50.\n\nNow, we have a particular solution (x₀, y₀) = (50, 25). To find the general solution, we can use the formula:\n\nx = x₀ + k * (b / gcd(a, b))\ny = y₀ - k * (a / gcd(a, b))\n\nwhere a = 3, b = 7, and gcd(a, b) = 1.\n\nx = 50 + 7k\ny = 25 - 3k\n\nNow, we need to find the positive integer values of x and y. We can do this by trying different integer values of k:\n\nFor k = 0:\nx = 50\ny = 25\n\nFor k = 1:\nx = 57\ny = 22\n\nFor k = 2:\nx = 64\ny = 19\n\nFor k = 3:\nx = 71\ny = 16\n\nFor k = 4:\nx = 78\ny = 13\n\nFor k = 5:\nx = 85\ny = 10\n\nFor k = 6:\nx = 92\ny = 7\n\nFor k = 7:\nx = 99\ny = 4\n\nFor k = 8:\nx = 106\ny = 1\n\nSo, the positive integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 3x + 7y = 25 are:\n\n(x, y) = (50, 25), (57, 22), (64, 19), (71, 16), (78, 13), (85, 10), (92, 7), (99, 4), and (106, 1)."
