    "message_1": "One possible numerical problem related to Abductive Logic is:\n\nA magician has 7 rabbits, 5 hats, and 3 tricks. If he selects one rabbit, one hat, and one trick randomly, what is the probability that he will perform a disappearing act using that rabbit, that hat, and that trick?\n\nAssume that the magician can only use one rabbit, one hat, and one trick for each performance, and that all rabbits, hats, and tricks are equally likely to be chosen. Express your answer as a fraction in simplest form.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the magician performing a disappearing act using a specific rabbit, hat, and trick, we need to determine the total number of possible combinations and the number of successful combinations.\n\nThere are 7 rabbits, 5 hats, and 3 tricks. So, there are a total of 7 * 5 * 3 = 105 possible combinations.\n\nSince the magician can only use one rabbit, one hat, and one trick for each performance, there is only 1 successful combination (the specific rabbit, hat, and trick for the disappearing act).\n\nTherefore, the probability of the magician performing a disappearing act using that specific rabbit, hat, and trick is 1/105."
