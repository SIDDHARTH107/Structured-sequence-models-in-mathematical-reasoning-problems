    "message_1": "A store has two different brands of pens: brand A and brand B. Brand A pens have a 25% chance of being defective, while brand B pens have a 15% chance of being defective. If a customer buys 4 pens of brand A and 6 pens of brand B, what is the probability that exactly 2 of the pens are defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective pens, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of a pen being defective, and n is the total number of pens.\n\nWe need to find the probability of having exactly 2 defective pens out of 4 brand A pens and 6 brand B pens. There are three possible scenarios:\n\n1. Two defective pens are from brand A, and none are from brand B.\n2. One defective pen is from brand A, and one is from brand B.\n3. No defective pens are from brand A, and two are from brand B.\n\nWe will calculate the probability of each scenario and then sum them up to find the total probability.\n\nScenario 1:\nP(2 defective pens from brand A) = C(4, 2) * (0.25)^2 * (1-0.25)^(4-2) = 6 * 0.0625 * 0.5625 = 0.140625\n\nP(0 defective pens from brand B) = C(6, 0) * (0.15)^0 * (1-0.15)^(6-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.735^6 = 0.315630\n\nP(Scenario 1) = P(2 defective pens from brand A) * P(0 defective pens from brand B) = 0.140625 * 0.315630 = 0.044363\n\nScenario 2:\nP(1 defective pen from brand A) = C(4, 1) * (0.25)^1 * (1-0.25)^(4-1) = 4 * 0.25 * 0.421875 = 0.421875\n\nP(1 defective pen from brand B) = C(6, 1) * (0.15)^1 * (1-0.15)^(6-1) = 6 * 0.15 * 0.443705 = 0.399771\n\nP(Scenario 2) = P(1 defective pen from brand A) * P(1 defective pen from brand B) = 0.421875 * 0.399771 = 0.168674\n\nScenario 3:\nP(0 defective pens from brand A) = C(4, 0) * (0.25)^0 * (1-0.25)^(4-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.316406 = 0.316406\n\nP(2 defective pens from brand B) = C(6, 2) * (0.15)^2 * (1-0.15)^(6-2) = 15 * 0.0225 * 0.592705 = 0.200474\n\nP(Scenario 3) = P(0 defective pens from brand A) * P(2 defective pens from brand B) = 0.316406 * 0.200474 = 0.063451\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities of all three scenarios:\n\nP(Exactly 2 defective pens) = P(Scenario 1) + P(Scenario 2) + P(Scenario 3) = 0.044363 + 0.168674 + 0.063451 = 0.276488\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 of the pens are defective is approximately 0.276488 or 27.65%."
