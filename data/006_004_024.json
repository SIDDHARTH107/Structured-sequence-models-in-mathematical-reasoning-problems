    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least one head, it's easier to find the probability of not getting any heads (i.e., getting all tails) and then subtracting that from 1.\n\nThe probability of getting a tail in one toss is 1/2. Since the coin is fair, the probability of getting 6 tails in a row is:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting at least one head, we subtract the probability of getting all tails from 1:\n\n1 - (1/64) = 63/64\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least one head in 6 tosses of a fair coin is 63/64."
