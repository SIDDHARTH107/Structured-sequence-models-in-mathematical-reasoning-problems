    "message_1": "In a group of 10 people, how many ways are there to divide them into three teams with 3 people each and one team with 1 person, using Polya's Enumeration Theorem?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's Enumeration Theorem, we need to find the cycle index polynomial of the group action. In this case, the group action is the symmetric group S_10 acting on the set of 10 people. The cycle index polynomial of S_10 is given by:\n\nP(S_10) = (1/10!)(p_1^10 + 9p_2^5 + 36p_3^3p_1 + 80p_4^2p_2 + 144p_5^2 + 144p_6p_4 + 120p_10)\n\nNow, we want to divide the 10 people into three teams of 3 people each and one team with 1 person. We can represent this partition as (3, 3, 3, 1). To find the number of ways to divide the people, we need to substitute the variables in the cycle index polynomial with the corresponding values for this partition:\n\nP(S_10)(3, 3, 3, 1) = (1/10!)(3^10 + 9(3^5) + 36(3^3)(3) + 80(3^2)(3) + 144(3^2) + 144(3)(3) + 120)\n\nNow, we can compute the value of this expression:\n\nP(S_10)(3, 3, 3, 1) = (1/3628800)(59049 + 9(243) + 36(27)(3) + 80(9)(3) + 144(9) + 144(9) + 120)\n\nP(S_10)(3, 3, 3, 1) = (1/3628800)(59049 + 2187 + 2916 + 2160 + 1296 + 1296 + 120)\n\nP(S_10)(3, 3, 3, 1) = (1/3628800)(67224)\n\nThe number of ways to divide the 10 people into three teams of 3 people each and one team with 1 person is:\n\n67224/3628800 = 16806/907200 = 1867/10080 = 7/42\n\nSo, there are 7 ways to divide the 10 people into the desired teams."
