    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector, and then integrate it over the path.\n\nFirst, let's find the displacement vector. The initial point is (4,0) and the final point is (8,6). The displacement vector is the difference between the final and initial points:\n\nDisplacement vector = (8-4, 6-0) = (4, 6)\n\nNext, let's find the force vector. Since the force is applied in the direction of the displacement, the force vector is parallel to the displacement vector. We can find the unit vector in the direction of the displacement and then multiply it by the magnitude of the force (10 pounds) to get the force vector.\n\nUnit vector in the direction of the displacement = (4/sqrt(4^2 + 6^2), 6/sqrt(4^2 + 6^2)) = (4/sqrt(52), 6/sqrt(52))\n\nForce vector = 10 * (4/sqrt(52), 6/sqrt(52)) = (40/sqrt(52), 60/sqrt(52))\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector:\n\nDot product = (40/sqrt(52))*(4) + (60/sqrt(52))*(6)\n\nDot product = 160/sqrt(52) + 360/sqrt(52)\n\nDot product = 520/sqrt(52)\n\nFinally, we need to integrate the dot product over the path. Since the force is constant, the integral is simply the dot product multiplied by the length of the path. The length of the path is the magnitude of the displacement vector:\n\nLength of the path = sqrt(4^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(52)\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nWork done = Integral of dot product = (520/sqrt(52)) * sqrt(52)\n\nWork done = 520\n\nSo, the work done by the force to move the object from point (4,0) to point (8,6) in a straight line is 520 pound-feet."
