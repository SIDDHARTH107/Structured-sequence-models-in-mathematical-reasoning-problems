    "message_2": "Liouville's theorem states that every bounded entire function is constant.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is an entire function, it is complex differentiable at every point in the complex plane. Additionally, we are given that $|f(z)| \\leq 5$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This means that the function $f(z)$ is bounded.\n\nBy Liouville's theorem, since $f(z)$ is both entire and bounded, it must be a constant function. Therefore, $f(z)$ is a constant function."
