    "message_2": "A complete graph K_n has n vertices, and each vertex is connected to every other vertex. To find the number of spanning trees in a complete graph, we can use the Cayley's formula:\n\nT(K_n) = n^(n-2)\n\nIn our case, we have a complete graph K10, so n = 10. Applying Cayley's formula:\n\nT(K_10) = 10^(10-2) = 10^8 = 100,000,000\n\nSo, there are 100,000,000 spanning trees in the complete graph K10."
