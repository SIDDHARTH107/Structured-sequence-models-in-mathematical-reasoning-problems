    "message_1": "A precise numerical problem related to Liouville's theorem and fundamental theorem of algebra in complex analysis could be:\n\nSuppose that a non-constant polynomial P(z) is defined on the entire complex plane and satisfies the condition that |P(z)| ≤ 1000 for all z. Prove that P(z) must be a constant polynomial.\n\nAs an extension to this problem, you could ask the math student to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.",
    "message_2": "Proof that P(z) must be a constant polynomial:\n\nAssume that P(z) is a non-constant polynomial of degree n > 0, with complex coefficients, i.e.,\n\nP(z) = a_nz^n + a_(n-1)z^(n-1) + ... + a_1z + a_0\n\nwhere a_n ≠ 0 and a_i are complex numbers.\n\nNow, consider the function f(z) = P(z)/z^n. Since P(z) is a polynomial, f(z) is an entire function (i.e., it is holomorphic on the entire complex plane). Moreover, we have\n\n|f(z)| = |P(z)/z^n| = |P(z)|/|z|^n ≤ 1000/|z|^n\n\nfor all z ≠ 0. Since |f(z)| goes to 0 as |z| goes to infinity, f(z) is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, f(z) must be a constant function, say f(z) = c.\n\nNow, we have P(z) = cz^n, which implies that P(z) is a constant polynomial times z^n. However, we are given that |P(z)| ≤ 1000 for all z, which means that |c| ≤ 1000. Since P(z) is a non-constant polynomial, n > 0, and thus |P(z)| must grow without bound as |z| goes to infinity. This contradicts the given condition, and therefore our assumption that P(z) is a non-constant polynomial must be false.\n\nHence, P(z) must be a constant polynomial.\n\nAs an extension, to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, one can use the following argument:\n\nAssume that P(z) is a non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients and has no complex roots. Then, we can define a function g(z) = 1/P(z), which is holomorphic on the entire complex plane except at the zeros of P(z). Since P(z) has no complex roots, g(z) is an entire function.\n\nNow, as |z| goes to infinity, |P(z)| goes to infinity (since P(z) is a non-constant polynomial), and thus |g(z)| goes to 0. This means that g(z) is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, g(z) must be a constant function. However, this contradicts the fact that |g(z)| goes to 0 as |z| goes to infinity.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that P(z) has no complex roots must be false, and thus every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. This proves the fundamental theorem of algebra."
