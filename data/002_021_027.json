    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 10 cm. Find the area of a sector of the circle if the central angle of the sector measures 60 degrees.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere the central angle is given in degrees, r is the radius of the circle, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this problem, the central angle is 60 degrees, and the radius is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) * π * (10)^2\nArea of sector = (1/6) * π * 100\nArea of sector = (100π) / 6\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\nArea of sector = (50π) / 3\n\nSo, the area of the sector is (50π) / 3 square centimeters, or approximately 52.35988 square centimeters."
