    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 4x + 3, we can use the vertex formula: x = -b / 2a, where a = 2 and b = -4.\n\nx = -(-4) / (2 * 2)\nx = 4 / 4\nx = 1\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging x = 1 back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) + 3\ny = 2 - 4 + 3\ny = 1\n\nSo, the vertex is at the point (1, 1).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is x = 1.\n\nNow, let's plot three points on the graph. We already have the vertex (1, 1). Let's find two more points by choosing x-values on either side of the vertex:\n\n1. When x = 0:\ny = 2(0)^2 - 4(0) + 3\ny = 3\nSo, the point is (0, 3).\n\n2. When x = 2:\ny = 2(2)^2 - 4(2) + 3\ny = 2(4) - 8 + 3\ny = 8 - 8 + 3\ny = 3\nSo, the point is (2, 3).\n\nIn summary, the vertex is at (1, 1), the axis of symmetry is x = 1, and three points on the graph are (0, 3), (1, 1), and (2, 3)."
