Next, find the symmetric difference of B and A, and then find the intersection of B and the result. Show that the two intersection results are not equal, and therefore prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and the symmetric difference of A and B.\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3} ∩ {1, 4} = {1}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A.\n\nB ∆ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {4} ∪ {1} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B and the symmetric difference of B and A.\n\nB ∩ (B ∆ A) = {2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 4} = {4}\n\nWe can see that the two intersection results are not equal:\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1} ≠ {4} = B ∩ (B ∆ A)\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
