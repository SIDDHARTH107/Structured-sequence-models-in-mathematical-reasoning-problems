    "message_2": "Calculating the volume of a regular truncated tetrahedron in hyperbolic space is a complex task that requires advanced knowledge of hyperbolic geometry. In hyperbolic space, the volume of a polyhedron depends on its dihedral angles, which are not constant as they are in Euclidean space.\n\nTo find the volume of a regular truncated tetrahedron in hyperbolic space with an edge length of 4, we would need to know the dihedral angles of the polyhedron. Unfortunately, there is no simple formula to calculate the volume of a regular truncated tetrahedron in hyperbolic space without additional information.\n\nHowever, if you are interested in the volume of a regular truncated tetrahedron in Euclidean space, you can use the following formula:\n\nVolume = (23/12) * (edge length)^3 * sqrt(2)\n\nFor an edge length of 4, the volume would be:\n\nVolume = (23/12) * (4)^3 * sqrt(2) â‰ˆ 180.66 cubic units"
