The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, C_2 x C_2, which has elements of orders 1 and 2.\n3. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, C_4 x C_2, which has elements of orders 1, 2, and 4.\n4. The dihedral group D_4, which is the group of symmetries of a square and has elements of orders 1, 2, and 4.\n5. The quaternion group Q_8, which has elements of orders 1, 2, and 4.\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic because they have different element orders and structures."
