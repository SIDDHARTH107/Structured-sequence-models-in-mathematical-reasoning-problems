    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 3x - x^2 within the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 3x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 3x\n\nx^2 = (3/2)x\n\nx = 0 or x = 3/2\n\nSo the points of intersection are at x = 0 and x = 3/2. Now we can find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 3/2]:\n\nArea = ∫(3x - x^2 - x^2) dx from 0 to 3/2\n\nArea = ∫(3x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 3/2\n\nNow we can integrate and evaluate:\n\nArea = [3/2 * x^2 - (2/3)x^3] from 0 to 3/2\n\nArea = (3/2 * (3/2)^2 - (2/3)(3/2)^3) - (3/2 * 0^2 - (2/3)0^3)\n\nArea = (3/2 * 9/4 - (2/3)(27/8)) = (27/8 - 18/8) = 9/8\n\nSo the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 3x - x^2 within the interval [0, 2] is 9/8 square units."
