    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime p must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, the number of such subgroups must divide 60 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of 2-Sylow subgroups are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, the number of such subgroups must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of 3-Sylow subgroups are 1 and 10.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, the number of such subgroups must divide 12 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible numbers of 5-Sylow subgroups are 1 and 6.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, so the group is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_60.\n\n2. Three 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: In this case, the group is isomorphic to A_4 × Z_5, which is a non-abelian group of order 60.\n\n3. Fifteen 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: In this case, the group is isomorphic to the alternating group A_5, which is a non-abelian simple group of order 60.\n\n4. Three 2-Sylow, ten 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This combination does not lead to any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n5. Three 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This combination does not lead to any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n6. Fifteen 2-Sylow, ten 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This combination does not lead to any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n7. Fifteen 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This combination does not lead to any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n8. Fifteen 2-Sylow, ten 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This combination does not lead to any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\nThus, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 60: Z_60, A_4 × Z_5, and A_5."
