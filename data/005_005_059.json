    "message_2": "To find the probability that a battery will last between 175 and 225 hours, we can use the standard normal distribution (also known as the Z-distribution). First, we need to convert the given values into Z-scores.\n\nZ-score formula: Z = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere:\nX = value\nμ = mean\nσ = standard deviation\n\nFor 175 hours:\nZ1 = (175 - 200) / 25 = -1\n\nFor 225 hours:\nZ2 = (225 - 200) / 25 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability between these two Z-scores. We can use a Z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the probabilities.\n\nP(-1 < Z < 1) = P(Z < 1) - P(Z < -1)\n\nUsing a Z-table or calculator:\nP(Z < 1) ≈ 0.8413\nP(Z < -1) ≈ 0.1587\n\nP(-1 < Z < 1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that a battery will last between 175 and 225 hours is approximately 68.26%."
