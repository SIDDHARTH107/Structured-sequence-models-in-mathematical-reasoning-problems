    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth, we can look for the smallest cycle in the given graph.\n\nLet's analyze the given edge list and look for cycles:\n\n1. (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10) - These edges form a path, not a cycle.\n2. (1,10) - This edge connects vertex 1 and vertex 10, creating a cycle with the path (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10). This cycle has a length of 10.\n3. (2,10) - This edge creates a cycle with the path (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10). This cycle has a length of 9.\n4. (3,9) - This edge creates a cycle with the path (3,4,5,6,7,8,9). This cycle has a length of 7.\n5. (4,8) - This edge creates a cycle with the path (4,5,6,7,8). This cycle has a length of 5.\n6. (5,7) - This edge creates a cycle with the path (5,6,7). This cycle has a length of 3.\n7. (6,10) - This edge creates a cycle with the path (6,7,8,9,10). This cycle has a length of 5.\n\nThe smallest cycle found is (5,6,7) with a length of 3. Therefore, the girth of this graph is 3."
