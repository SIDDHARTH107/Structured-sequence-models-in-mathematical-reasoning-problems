    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nUsing the Hill cipher with a 2x2 key matrix, encrypt the message \"MATH\" represented as the corresponding numerical values of the letters in the alphabet (12, 0, 19, 7). The key matrix is [5 8; 17 3]. Show all of your work for calculating the encrypted message.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with a 2x2 key matrix, we first need to represent the message as a column vector. Since \"MATH\" corresponds to the numerical values (12, 0, 19, 7), we can represent the message as two column vectors:\n\nP1 = | 12 |   P2 = | 19 |\n       |  0 |          |  7 |\n\nNow, we need to multiply each of these column vectors by the given key matrix:\n\nK = | 5  8 |\n      | 17 3 |\n\nTo encrypt the message, we perform the matrix multiplication K * P1 and K * P2:\n\nC1 = K * P1 = | 5  8 | * | 12 | = | 5*12 + 8*0 | = | 60 | (mod 26)\n                   | 17 3 |   |  0 |   | 17*12 + 3*0 |   | 204| (mod 26)\n\nC2 = K * P2 = | 5  8 | * | 19 | = | 5*19 + 8*7 | = | 171 | (mod 26)\n                   | 17 3 |   |  7 |   | 17*19 + 3*7 |   | 350 | (mod 26)\n\nNow, we need to apply the modulo 26 operation to the resulting column vectors:\n\nC1 = | 60  | (mod 26) = | 8  |\n       | 204 | (mod 26) = | 4  |\n\nC2 = | 171 | (mod 26) = | 23 |\n       | 350 | (mod 26) = | 0  |\n\nSo, the encrypted message is represented by the column vectors C1 and C2:\n\nC1 = | 8  |   C2 = | 23 |\n       | 4  |          |  0  |\n\nConverting these numerical values back to letters, we get the encrypted message \"I E X A\"."
