    "message_2": "Since the given differential equation is linear with constant coefficients, we can solve it using the characteristic equation method. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$r^2 + 4r + 13 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and its solutions are:\n\n$r = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4 \\cdot 13}}{2} = -2 \\pm 3i$\n\nSo, the general solution of the given differential equation is:\n\n$y(t) = e^{-2t}(A\\cos(3t) + B\\sin(3t))$\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions:\n\n$y(0) = 2 = e^{-2 \\cdot 0}(A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0)) \\Rightarrow A = 2$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = -1 = -2e^{-2 \\cdot 0}(2\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0)) + e^{-2 \\cdot 0}(-2B\\cos(0) + 3\\sin(0)) \\Rightarrow B = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n$y(t) = e^{-2t}(2\\cos(3t) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(3t))$\n\nSince $y(t)$ is periodic with a period of $2\\pi$, the fundamental frequency component is given by:\n\n$y(t) = C\\cos(3t - \\phi)$\n\nWe can find the amplitude C and phase $\\phi$ by comparing the coefficients:\n\n$C\\cos(\\phi) = 2$\n\n$C\\sin(\\phi) = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSquaring and adding these equations, we get:\n\n$C^2 = 2^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 4 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{17}{4}$\n\nSo, $C = \\sqrt{\\frac{17}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{2}$\n\nTo find the phase $\\phi$, we can use the tangent function:\n\n$\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}$\n\n$\\phi = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$\n\nTherefore, the expression for $y(t)$ in its standard form is:\n\n$y(t) = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{2}\\cos(3t - \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right))$"
