    "message_2": "This system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo see why, let's first simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n2x + 5y = 17 (Equation 1)\n2x + 5y = 17 (Equation 2, after dividing by 2)\n\nNow we can see that both equations are identical. Since they represent the same line, they have infinitely many points in common, which means there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations."
