    "message_2": "To find the equation of the irreducible quartic curve C, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Blow up the point p = (0,1,0) on the cubic curve X.\n2. Find the strict transform of the line Y=0 on the blowup.\n3. Contract the strict transform of the line Y=0 to a point.\n\nStep 1: Blowing up the point p = (0,1,0) on the cubic curve X\n\nWe introduce new coordinates (x, y, z, u, v) such that x = uX, y = vY, and z = uvZ. The blowup of X at p is given by the equations:\n\ny^2z - x(x-z)(x-2z) = 0\nx = uX\ny = vY\nz = uvZ\n\nSubstituting x, y, and z in the first equation, we get:\n\n(v^2Y^2)(uvZ) - (uX)((uX)-uvZ)((uX)-2uvZ) = 0\n\nStep 2: Find the strict transform of the line Y=0 on the blowup\n\nThe line Y=0 on the blowup is given by vY = 0. Since we are blowing up at p = (0,1,0), we have v â‰  0. Therefore, the strict transform of the line Y=0 on the blowup is given by Y = 0.\n\nStep 3: Contract the strict transform of the line Y=0 to a point\n\nTo contract the strict transform of the line Y=0 to a point, we can set Y = 0 in the equation obtained in Step 1:\n\n(v^2(0)^2)(uvZ) - (uX)((uX)-uvZ)((uX)-2uvZ) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(uX)((uX)-uvZ)((uX)-2uvZ) = 0\n\nNow, we can eliminate u and v by substituting X = x/u and Z = z/v:\n\n(x)((x)-z)((x)-2z) = 0\n\nThis is the equation of the irreducible quartic curve C obtained by blowing up X at p and then contracting the strict transform of the line Y=0 on this blowup to a point."
