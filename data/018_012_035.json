    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow let's find (A × B) ∩ A:\n\nSince A = {1, 2, 3}, we are looking for elements in A × B that have the same first component as an element in A. However, the elements in A × B are ordered pairs, while the elements in A are single numbers. Therefore, there are no elements in common between A × B and A. So, (A × B) ∩ A = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNext, let's find B ∩ A:\n\nB ∩ A = {2, 3} (the elements that are common in both A and B)\n\nNow let's find A × (B ∩ A):\n\nA × (B ∩ A) = A × {2, 3} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nNow we can compare (A × B) ∩ A and A × (B ∩ A):\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅\nA × (B ∩ A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nSince (A × B) ∩ A ≠ A × (B ∩ A), this shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
