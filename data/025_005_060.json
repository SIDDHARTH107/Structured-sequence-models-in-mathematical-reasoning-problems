Determine the type of singularity at the origin $(0,0,0)$.\n\nHint: Calculate the partial derivatives of $x^2 + y^3 - z^5$ and evaluate them at $(0,0,0)$. Then, use the Jacobian criterion to classify the singular point.",
    "message_2": "To determine the type of singularity at the origin $(0,0,0)$, we first calculate the partial derivatives of the equation $x^2 + y^3 - z^5 = 0$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$. \n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + y^3 - z^5) = 2x,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + y^3 - z^5) = 3y^2,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2 + y^3 - z^5) = -5z^4.\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the origin $(0,0,0)$:\n$$\n2x(0,0,0) = 0,\n$$\n$$\n3y^2(0,0,0) = 0,\n$$\n$$\n-5z^4(0,0,0) = 0.\n$$\n\nNext, we use the Jacobian criterion to classify the singular point. The Jacobian matrix of the partial derivatives is given by:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y \\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nComputing the second partial derivatives, we get:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 6y & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -20z^3\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nEvaluating the Jacobian matrix at the origin $(0,0,0)$, we obtain:\n$$\nJ(0,0,0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe rank of the Jacobian matrix at the origin is 1, which is less than the dimension of the ambient space $\\mathbb{C}^3$, which is 3. Therefore, the origin $(0,0,0)$ is a singular point of the algebraic variety $V$.\n\nSince the rank of the Jacobian matrix is 1, the tangent space to $V$ at the origin is a 1-dimensional complex subspace of $\\mathbb{C}^3$. This means that the singularity at the origin is an isolated singularity."
