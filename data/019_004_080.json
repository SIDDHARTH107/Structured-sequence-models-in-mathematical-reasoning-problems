    "message_1": "Consider the statement \"I will finish my math homework before dinner\". Represent this statement in temporal logic using the variables F and D, where F represents \"finish math homework\" and D represents \"dinner\". Write the statement as a formula in temporal logic and determine if it is true or false if \"finish math homework\" takes 2 hours and \"dinner\" is at 6 PM.",
    "message_2": "In temporal logic, we can represent the statement \"I will finish my math homework before dinner\" as:\n\nF → ◇D\n\nThis formula means that if F (finish math homework) is true, then eventually D (dinner) will be true.\n\nNow, let's determine if this statement is true or false given that \"finish math homework\" takes 2 hours and \"dinner\" is at 6 PM. Suppose you start your math homework at 4 PM.\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to finish the math homework, you will complete it at 6 PM. However, dinner is also at 6 PM. In this case, you are not finishing your math homework before dinner, so the statement is false."
