    "message_2": "To calculate the first two principal components, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each variable (height and weight).\n2. Subtract the mean from each data point to center the data.\n3. Calculate the covariance matrix of the centered data.\n4. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n5. Sort the eigenvectors by their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order.\n6. Select the first two eigenvectors as the first two principal components.\n7. Project the centered data onto the first two principal components.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Mean of height: (175 + 162 + 180 + 167 + 157 + 176 + 173 + 165 + 156 + 179) / 10 = 1690 / 10 = 169 cm\n   Mean of weight: (70 + 58 + 79 + 65 + 55 + 71 + 74 + 63 + 51 + 76) / 10 = 662 / 10 = 66.2 kg\n\n2.
