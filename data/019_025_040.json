    "message_2": "If the production of product A drops by 50 units per day when the temperature drops by 10 degrees Celsius, then when the temperature drops by 20 degrees Celsius, the production will drop by 50 units * 2 = 100 units per day.\n\nThe factory initially produces 500 units of product A per day. So, when the temperature drops by 20 degrees Celsius, the daily production will be 500 units - 100 units = 400 units of product A."
