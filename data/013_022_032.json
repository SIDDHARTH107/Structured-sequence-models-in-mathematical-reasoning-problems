    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, there are two players, the dictator and the recipient. The dictator has an amount of money, let's say $100, and must divide it between themselves and the recipient. The recipient has no input into the decision-making process and must accept whatever amount the dictator chooses to give them. \n\nIf the dictator is risk-averse and afraid of the recipient rejecting their offer, how much money should they give to the recipient to maximize the chances of the recipient accepting the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the recipient does not have the option to reject the offer made by the dictator. They must accept whatever amount the dictator chooses to give them. Therefore, the dictator does not need to worry about the recipient rejecting their offer.\n\nHowever, if the dictator wants to be fair or generous, they could consider giving the recipient a larger portion of the money. A common fair split would be 50-50, giving the recipient $50 and keeping $50 for themselves. But ultimately, the dictator can choose any amount they want to give to the recipient, as the recipient has no choice but to accept it."
