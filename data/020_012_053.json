    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 4 over the interval [-1, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 4)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0\n\nDivide by 6:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 2.\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [-1, 4]:\n\nf(-1) = 2(-1)^3 - 9(-1)^2 + 12(-1) + 4 = -15\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 12(1) + 4 = 9\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 12(2) + 4 = 8\nf(4) = 2(4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 12(4) + 4 = 20\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find that the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 4 over the interval [-1, 4] is 20, which occurs at x = 4."
