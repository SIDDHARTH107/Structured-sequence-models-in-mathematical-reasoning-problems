    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). To find the maximum number of independent vertices, we can use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, we have 7 vertices and 10 edges, so the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 10 = 20. The maximum degree of a vertex in an independent set is 1, as it can be connected to at most one other vertex in the set. Therefore, the maximum number of independent vertices in this graph is the largest integer k such that k * (k - 1) <= 20.\n\nWe can test values of k starting from the largest possible value (7, since there are 7 vertices) and decreasing until we find a value that satisfies the inequality:\n\n7 * (7 - 1) = 42 (too large)\n6 * (6 - 1) = 30 (too large)\n5 * (5 - 1) = 20 (satisfies the inequality)\n\nThus, the maximum number of independent vertices that can be selected from this graph is 5."
