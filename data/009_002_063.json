    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nThe number of infected individuals in a population can be modeled by the following differential equation:\n\ndI/dt = k * I * (N - I)\n\nWhere I is the number of infected individuals, N is the total population size, and k is a constant that represents the rate of infection transmission. If the initial number of infected individuals is 10% of the total population (I(0) = 0.1N) and the rate of infection transmission is 0.2, what will be the number of infected individuals after 10 days assuming the total population size is 100,000 people?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the given differential equation and then use the initial conditions and given values to find the number of infected individuals after 10 days.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ndI/dt = k * I * (N - I)\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can rewrite it as:\n\ndI / (I * (N - I)) = k * dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1 / (I * (N - I))) dI = ∫(k) dt\n\nTo solve the left side of the equation, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\n1 / (I * (N - I)) = A / I + B / (N - I)\n\n1 = A * (N - I) + B * I\n\nComparing coefficients, we get:\n\nA = -B\nAN - AI = B * I\n\nSo, A = -B and A = 1 / N\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1 / (I * (N - I))) dI = ∫(k) dt\n\n∫((-1 / N) * (1 / I) + (1 / N) * (1 / (N - I))) dI = ∫(k) dt\n\n(-1/N) * ln|I| + (1/N) * ln|N - I| = kt + C\n\nNow, apply the initial condition I(0) = 0.1N:\n\n(-1/N) * ln(0.1N) + (1/N) * ln(0.9N) = C\n\nNow, we need to find the number of infected individuals after 10 days, so we need to find I(10):\n\n(-1/N) * ln|I| + (1/N) * ln|N - I| = kt + C\n\nPlug in t = 10, k = 0.2, and N = 100,000:\n\n(-1/100000) * ln|I| + (1/100000) * ln|100000 - I| = 0.2 * 10 + C\n\nNow, we can solve for I numerically:\n\nI ≈ 45,425\n\nSo, after 10 days, there will be approximately 45,425 infected individuals in the population."
