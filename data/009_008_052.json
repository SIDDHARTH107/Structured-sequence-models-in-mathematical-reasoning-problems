Determine the shape of the wave and the speed of propagation.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 9X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 9\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 9\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2T(t) = 0$ and $X''(x) - \\frac{k^2}{9}X(x) = 0$\n\nThe first equation is a simple harmonic oscillator equation with angular frequency $k$. The general solution is:\n\n$T(t) = A\\cos(kt) + B\\sin(kt)$\n\nSince $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0)=0$, we have $T'(0) = 0$. Differentiating $T(t)$ with respect to $t$ and setting $t=0$, we get:\n\n$T'(t) = -kA\\sin(kt) + kB\\cos(kt)$\n\n$T'(0) = kB = 0 \\Rightarrow B = 0$\n\nSo, $T(t) = A\\cos(kt)$.\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation:\n\n$X''(x) - \\frac{k^2}{9}X(x) = 0$\n\nThis is also a simple harmonic oscillator equation with angular frequency $\\frac{k}{3}$. The general solution is:\n\n$X(x) = C\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x) + D\\sin(\\frac{k}{3}x)$\n\nSince $u(x,0)=\\sin(2\\pi x)$, we have $X(0) = D = 0$. Therefore, $X(x) = C\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x)$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = AC\\cos(kt)\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x)$\n\nTo determine the shape of the wave and the speed of propagation, we need to find the values of $A$, $C$, and $k$. We know that $u(x,0)=\\sin(2\\pi x)$, so:\n\n$\\sin(2\\pi x) = AC\\cos(0)\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x)$\n\nSince the left side is a sine function with a period of 1, we can match the right side by setting $\\frac{k}{3} = 2\\pi$, which gives $k = 6\\pi$. This means that the speed of propagation is $v = \\frac{k}{3} = 2\\pi$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$u(x,t) = AC\\cos(6\\pi t)\\cos(2\\pi x)$\n\nTo find $A$ and $C$, we can use the initial condition $u(x,0)=\\sin(2\\pi x)$:\n\n$\\sin(2\\pi x) = AC\\cos(0)\\cos(2\\pi x)$\n\nSince the cosine function is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $\\cos(2\\pi x)$:\n\n$A = \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi x)}{\\cos(2\\pi x)}$\n\nSince the left side is a sine function with a period of 1, we can match the right side by setting $A = 1$ and $C = 1$.\n\nFinally, the solution to the wave equation is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\cos(6\\pi t)\\cos(2\\pi x)$\n\nThe shape of the wave is a cosine function with a period of 1, and the speed of propagation is $2\\pi$."
