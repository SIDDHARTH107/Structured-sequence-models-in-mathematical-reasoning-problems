    "message_2": "A smooth cubic curve is a curve defined by a polynomial equation of degree 3 in two variables, with no singular points (i.e., points where the curve has a cusp or self-intersection). In the projective plane, such a curve has 9 intersection points with a line in general position.\n\nLet's consider a line that passes through exactly 5 points on the cubic curve. Since the line intersects the curve in 9 points, it must also intersect the curve at 4 other points that are not on the curve. These 4 points can be considered as the intersection points of the line with the residual cubic curve obtained by removing the 5 points from the original curve.\n\nNow, let's count the number of such lines. For each set of 5 points on the curve, we can form a residual cubic curve by removing these points. There are C(21, 5) ways to choose 5 points from the 21 points on the curve, where C(n, k) denotes the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\". \n\nC(21, 5) = 21! / (5! * (21 - 5)!) = 20349\n\nFor each residual cubic curve, we can count the number of lines that intersect it in 4 points. By Bezout's theorem, two curves of degree m and n intersect in m * n points, counted with multiplicity. Since the residual cubic curve is of degree 3 and a line is of degree 1, they intersect in 3 * 1 = 3 points. However, we need the line to intersect the residual curve in 4 points, so we need to count the lines that intersect the curve with multiplicity 2 at one of the intersection points.\n\nLet's consider the intersection points of the residual cubic curve with a line in general position. There are 3 intersection points, and each of them can be a point of multiplicity 2. Therefore, there are 3 lines that intersect the residual cubic curve in 4 points.\n\nNow, we can multiply the number of ways to choose 5 points from the 21 points on the curve by the number of lines that intersect the residual cubic curve in 4 points:\n\n20349 * 3 = 61047\n\nSo, there are 61047 lines that pass through exactly 5 of the 21 points lying on a smooth cubic curve."
