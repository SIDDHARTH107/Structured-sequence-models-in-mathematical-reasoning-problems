    "message_1": "Suppose you are given an encrypted message that uses a substitution cipher. You are told that the most frequent letter in the message corresponds to the letter \"E\" in the English language. The next two most frequent letters correspond to \"T\" and \"A\" in some order. Assuming a standard frequency distribution of letters in English, determine what letters in the message correspond to the top 5 most frequent letters in the English language.",
    "message_2": "To determine the letters in the message that correspond to the top 5 most frequent letters in the English language, we first need to know the standard frequency distribution of letters in English. The top 5 most frequent letters in English are:\n\n1. E (12.7%)\n2. T (9.1%)\n3. A (8.2%)\n4. O (7.5%)\n5. I (7.0%)\n\nNow, analyze the encrypted message and find the frequency of each letter in the message. The most frequent letter in the message corresponds to \"E.\" The next two most frequent letters correspond to \"T\" and \"A\" in some order. To determine the order, you can look at the context of the message or use bigram (two-letter) frequencies in English to make an educated guess.\n\nOnce you have identified the letters corresponding to \"E,\" \"T,\" and \"A,\" continue analyzing the frequency of the remaining letters in the message. The fourth most frequent letter will correspond to \"O,\" and the fifth most frequent letter will correspond to \"I.\"\n\nIn summary, by analyzing the frequency of letters in the encrypted message and comparing them to the standard frequency distribution of letters in English, you can determine the letters in the message that correspond to the top 5 most frequent letters in the English language."
