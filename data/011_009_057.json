    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to partition a set of 6 elements, we use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) counts the number of different ways to partition a set of n elements.\n\nFor a set of 6 elements, the Bell number B(6) is 203. Therefore, there are 203 different ways to partition a set of 6 elements."
