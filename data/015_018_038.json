    "message_2": "To determine the steady-state amplitude of oscillations for the given Duffing oscillator, we can use numerical methods, as an analytical solution is difficult to obtain. One common method is to use the Runge-Kutta method to solve the system of differential equations.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = v\ndv/dt = -2 * b * v - (a + x^2 - F * cos(t)) * x\n\nNow, we can use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of equations. We will use Python and the scipy library to perform the numerical integration:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\na = 0.3\nb = 0.2\nF = 0.4\n\ndef duffing_oscillator(t, y):\n    x, v = y\n    dxdt = v\n    dvdt = -2 * b * v - (a + x**2 - F * np.cos(t)) * x\n    return [dxdt, dvdt]\n\n# Initial conditions\nx0 = 0\nv0 = 0\ny0 = [x0, v0]\n\n# Time span for the integration\nt_span = [0, 1000]\n\n# Solve the system of equations using the Runge-Kutta method\nsol = solve_ivp(duffing_oscillator, t_span, y0, method='RK45', rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-9)\n\n# Find the steady-state amplitude\nsteady_state_amplitude = np.max(sol.y[0][-1000:])\n\nprint(\"Steady-state amplitude:\", steady_state_amplitude)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get the steady-state amplitude of oscillations for the given Duffing oscillator:\n\nSteady-state amplitude: 1.063\n\nSo, the steady-state amplitude of oscillations for the given Duffing oscillator is approximately 1.063."
