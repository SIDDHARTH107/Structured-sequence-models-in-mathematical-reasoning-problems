    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b:\n\nA = | 2  1  1 |       x = | x |       b = | 7 |\n    | 0  1  5 |           | y |           | 5 |\n    | 0  0  1 |           | z |           | 2 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition states that a symmetric positive-definite matrix A can be decomposed into a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T such that A = LL^T.\n\nSince the matrix A is not symmetric, we cannot apply Cholesky decomposition directly. However, we can still solve the system of linear equations using forward and backward substitution since the matrix A is already lower triangular.\n\nForward substitution:\n\n1. 2x + y + z = 7\n2. y + 5z = 5\n3. z = 2\n\nFrom equation (3), we have z = 2.\n\nNow, substitute z into equation (2):\n\ny + 5(2) = 5\ny = 5 - 10\ny = -5\n\nFinally, substitute y and z into equation (1):\n\n2x - 5 + 2 = 7\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 5, y = -5, and z = 2."
