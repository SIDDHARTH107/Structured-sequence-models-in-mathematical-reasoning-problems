C_20 × C_2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 20 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. C_10 × C_4: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 10 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n4. C_8 × C_5: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 5.\n5. D_20: The dihedral group of order 40, which is the group of symmetries of a regular 20-gon.\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic because they have different structures and cannot be mapped onto each other by any isomorphism."
