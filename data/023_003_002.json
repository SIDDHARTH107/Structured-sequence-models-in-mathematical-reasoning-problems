    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using Fourier series, we will first find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the homogeneous boundary value problem (BVP) and then use them to construct the solution for the inhomogeneous PDE.\n\nStep 1: Solve the homogeneous BVP\nThe homogeneous BVP is given by:\n\nv_xx + λv = 0,  0 < x < π\nv(0) = v(π) = 0\n\nThe general solution of the above ODE is:\n\nv(x) = A*sin(√λx) + B*cos(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nv(0) = A*sin(0) + B*cos(0) = B = 0\nv(π) = A*sin(√λπ) = 0\n\nSince A ≠ 0 (non-trivial solution), we have:\n\nsin(√λπ) = 0\n\nThis implies that √λπ = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, λ_n = n^2 and the corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n\nv_n(x) = sin(nx)\n\nStep 2: Expand the initial condition f(x) in terms of eigenfunctions\n\nf(x) = x = Σ[a_n * sin(nx)]\n\nTo find the coefficients a_n, we use the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[x * sin(nx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nIntegrating by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n)cos(nx)\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(-x/n)cos(nx)sin(nx)|_(0 to π) + (1/n)∫cos(nx) dx] from 0 to π\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0))] = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0)\n\nHowever, for n = 1, we have:\n\na_1 = (2/π) * ∫[x * sin(x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nIntegrating by parts again:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(x) dx\ndu = dx, v = -cos(x)\n\na_1 = (2/π) * [(-x * cos(x) + sin(x))|_(0 to π)] = 2\n\nSo, f(x) = 2 * sin(x)\n\nStep 3: Solve the inhomogeneous PDE\n\nThe general solution of the inhomogeneous PDE is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[b_n(t) * sin(nx)]\n\nSubstituting this into the PDE:\n\nΣ[db_n(t)/dt * sin(nx)] = -Σ[n^2 * b_n(t) * sin(nx)] + sin(x)\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(nx):\n\ndb_n(t)/dt = -n^2 * b_n(t) + δ_(n,1)\n\nwhere δ_(n,1) is the Kronecker delta function (δ_(n,1) = 1 if n = 1, and 0 otherwise).\n\nThe solution for b_n(t) is:\n\nb_n(t) = c_n * exp(-n^2 * t) + (1 - exp(-n^2 * t))/n^2 for n = 1\nb_n(t) = c_n * exp(-n^2 * t) for n ≠ 1\n\nStep 4: Apply the initial condition u(x,0) = f(x)\n\nu(x,0) = Σ[b_n(0) * sin(nx)] = 2 * sin(x)\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(nx):\n\nb_n(0) = 2δ_(n,1)\n\nSo, c_n = 2 for n = 1 and c_n = 0 for n ≠ 1.\n\nStep 5: Write the final solution\n\nu(x,t) = 2 * exp(-t) * sin(x) + Σ[0 * sin(nx)] for n ≠ 1\n\nThus, the solution for the given PDE is:\n\nu(x,t) = 2 * exp(-t) * sin(x)"
