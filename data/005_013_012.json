    "message_2": "The correlation coefficient (r) between two variables X and Y can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr = Cov(X, Y) / (SD(X) * SD(Y))\n\nwhere Cov(X, Y) is the covariance between X and Y, and SD(X) and SD(Y) are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively.\n\nGiven the covariance is 10 and the standard deviations are 4 and 5, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = 10 / (4 * 5)\n\nr = 10 / 20\n\nr = 0.5\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the two variables X and Y is 0.5."
