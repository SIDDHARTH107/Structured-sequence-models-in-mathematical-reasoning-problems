    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length × width): 8 cm × 5 cm = 40 cm². Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 40 cm² × 2 = 80 cm².\n\n2. The area of the second pair of opposite faces (length × height): 8 cm × 3 cm = 24 cm². Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 24 cm² × 2 = 48 cm².\n\n3. The area of the third pair of opposite faces (width × height): 5 cm × 3 cm = 15 cm². Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 15 cm² × 2 = 30 cm².\n\nNow, we add the total areas of each pair of faces together: 80 cm² + 48 cm² + 30 cm² = 158 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 158 cm²."
