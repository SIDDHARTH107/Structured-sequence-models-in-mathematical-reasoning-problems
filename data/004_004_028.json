    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 3x^2 - 4x + 1 between the limits of x = 0 and x = 2, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of the function is:\n\n∫(3x^2 - 4x + 1) dx = ∫(3x^2) dx - ∫(4x) dx + ∫(1) dx\n\nNow, we integrate each term:\n\n∫(3x^2) dx = x^3 + C1\n∫(4x) dx = 2x^2 + C2\n∫(1) dx = x + C3\n\nSo, the integral of the function is:\n\nx^3 - 2x^2 + x + C (where C = C1 + C2 + C3)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the limits x = 0 and x = 2:\n\nF(2) = (2^3) - 2(2^2) + 2 = 8 - 8 + 2 = 2\nF(0) = (0^3) - 2(0^2) + 0 = 0\n\nNow, subtract F(0) from F(2) to find the area under the curve:\n\nArea = F(2) - F(0) = 2 - 0 = 2\n\nThe exact value of the area under the curve y = 3x^2 - 4x + 1 between the limits of x = 0 and x = 2 is 2."
