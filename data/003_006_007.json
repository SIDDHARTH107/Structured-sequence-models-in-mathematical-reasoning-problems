    "message_1": "A triangle has angles of 35 degrees and 80 degrees and a side opposite the 35 degree angle that measures 9 units. Find the length of the side opposite the 80 degree angle (round to the nearest hundredth).",
    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Sines to solve this problem. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B)\n\nwhere a is the side opposite angle A, b is the side opposite angle B, and A and B are the given angles. We are given angle A = 35 degrees, angle B = 80 degrees, and side a = 9 units. We want to find the length of side b. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n9 / sin(35) = b / sin(80)\n\nNow we can solve for b:\n\nb = 9 * sin(80) / sin(35)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values and perform the calculation, we get:\n\nb â‰ˆ 14.63\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 80-degree angle is approximately 14.63 units, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
