Using modal logic, if the statement \"It is necessarily the case that John's number is odd\" is true, what is the smallest possible number John could be thinking of?",
    "message_2": "If it is necessarily the case that John's number is odd, then John must be thinking of an odd number. The smallest odd number between 1 and 10 is 1. Therefore, the smallest possible number John could be thinking of is 1."
