    "message_2": "To create a generating function for the number of ways to choose a subset of the set {1, 2, 3, 4} such that the sum of the selected elements is odd, we can assign a polynomial to each element in the set. For odd elements, the polynomial will be (1 + x^element), and for even elements, the polynomial will be (1 + x^(element - 1)).\n\nFor the given set {1, 2, 3, 4}, the polynomials will be:\n\n1: (1 + x)\n2: (1 + x)\n3: (1 + x^3)\n4: (1 + x^3)\n\nNow, we multiply these polynomials together to get the generating function:\n\n(1 + x)(1 + x)(1 + x^3)(1 + x^3) = (1 + 2x + x^2)(1 + 2x^3 + x^6)\n\nNow, we expand the product:\n\n(1 + 2x + x^2)(1 + 2x^3 + x^6) = 1 + 2x + x^2 + 2x^3 + 4x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6 + 2x^7 + x^8\n\nThe coefficient of the term x^3 in the generating function is 2."
