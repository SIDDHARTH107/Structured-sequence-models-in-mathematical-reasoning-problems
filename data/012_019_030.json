    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the given graph, we can use the edge coloring technique. We will start by assigning colors to the edges in a way that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\n```\n   1--2--3--4\n   |  |  |  |\n   5--6--7--8\n```\n\nWe can color the edges as follows:\n\n```\n   1--(1)--2--(2)--3--(1)--4\n   |        |        |        |\n  (2)      (3)      (2)      (3)\n   |        |        |        |\n   5--(1)--6--(2)--7--(1)--8\n```\n\nIn this coloring, we used 3 colors (1, 2, and 3) to color the edges of the graph so that no two adjacent edges have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the given graph is 3."
