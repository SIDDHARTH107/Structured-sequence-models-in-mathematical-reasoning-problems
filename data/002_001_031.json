    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 6 cm and a height of 8 cm. What is the area of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 6 cm and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (6 cm × 8 cm) / 2\nArea = (48 cm²) / 2\nArea = 24 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 24 square centimeters."
