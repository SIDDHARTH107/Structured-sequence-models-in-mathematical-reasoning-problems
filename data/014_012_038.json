    "message_1": "A Vigenere cipher key is composed of four alphabetical characters. The message \"MATHEMATICS\" is encrypted using the key \"MATH\" and produces the ciphertext \"MHXPHFMSVQ\". What is the numerical value of the repeated key when it is written in terms of its corresponding numeric positions in the alphabet?",
    "message_2": "To find the numerical value of the repeated key, we first need to understand how the Vigenere cipher works. In this cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a number of positions determined by the corresponding letter in the key. The key is repeated as many times as necessary to cover the entire plaintext.\n\nIn this case, the key is \"MATH\" and the plaintext is \"MATHEMATICS\". The key is repeated to cover the entire plaintext, resulting in \"MATHMATHMAT\". Now, we can find the numerical value of the repeated key by converting each letter to its corresponding numeric position in the alphabet:\n\nM -> 13\nA -> 1\nT -> 20\nH -> 8\nM -> 13\nA -> 1\nT -> 20\nH -> 8\nM -> 13\nA -> 1\nT -> 20\n\nNow, we can add these values together to find the numerical value of the repeated key:\n\n13 + 1 + 20 + 8 + 13 + 1 + 20 + 8 + 13 + 1 + 20 = 118\n\nSo, the numerical value of the repeated key is 118."
