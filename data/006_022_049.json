    "message_1": "In a certain school, there are 120 students studying mathematics. Out of them, 70 students like probability the most. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that the selected student likes probability the most?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student likes probability the most, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of students who like probability the most, which is 70. The total number of outcomes is the total number of students studying mathematics, which is 120.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student likes probability the most is:\n\nProbability = 70 / 120\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:\n\nProbability = (70 รท 10) / (120 รท 10) = 7 / 12\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected student likes probability the most is 7/12 or approximately 0.5833."
