    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology groups H^k(X) for k = 0, 1, and 2, we will use the fact that the De Rham cohomology of a smooth manifold is isomorphic to its singular cohomology with real coefficients. \n\nFor the unit circle X in R^2, we can use the following cellular decomposition:\n\n- One 0-cell (a point)\n- One 1-cell (the circle itself)\n\nNow, we can compute the cellular cochain complex with real coefficients:\n\nC^0(X) = R (generated by the 0-cell)\nC^1(X) = R (generated by the 1-cell)\nC^2(X) = 0 (since there are no 2-cells)\n\nThe coboundary maps are given by:\n\nd^0: C^0(X) -> C^1(X), which is the zero map since there is only one 0-cell.\nd^1: C^1(X) -> C^2(X), which is also the zero map since there are no 2-cells.\n\nNow, we can compute the De Rham cohomology groups as the kernel of the coboundary maps modulo the image of the previous coboundary map:\n\nH^0(X) = ker(d^0) / im(d^(-1)) = R / 0 = R\nH^1(X) = ker(d^1) / im(d^0) = R / 0 = R\nH^2(X) = ker(d^2) / im(d^1) = 0 / 0 = 0\n\nSo, the De Rham cohomology groups H^k(X) for k = 0, 1, and 2 are:\n\nH^0(X) = R\nH^1(X) = R\nH^2(X) = 0"
