    "message_2": "To stabilize an unstable signal, we need to analyze the time-domain signal x(t) and modify it to ensure stability. In general, a signal is considered unstable if it has unbounded growth or oscillations over time. Since the signal has a frequency component at ω = 10 rad/s, we can represent the time-domain signal as:\n\nx(t) = A * sin(10t + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.\n\nTo stabilize the signal, we need to ensure that it does not grow unbounded or oscillate indefinitely. One way to achieve this is by introducing a damping factor that attenuates the signal over time. A common choice for a damping factor is an exponential decay term. Thus, we can modify the time-domain signal as follows:\n\nx_stable(t) = A * e^(-αt) * sin(10t + φ)\n\nwhere α is the damping factor. The damping factor α should be positive to ensure that the signal decays over time, leading to a stable signal. The choice of α depends on the desired rate of decay and the specific application.\n\nIn summary, to stabilize the unstable signal x(t) with a frequency component at ω = 10 rad/s, we can introduce a damping factor α > 0 and modify the time-domain signal as:\n\nx_stable(t) = A * e^(-αt) * sin(10t + φ)"
