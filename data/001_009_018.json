    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are those that have the same variable and exponent. In this case, we have terms with x^2 and terms with x.\n\nFirst, let's combine the x^2 terms:\n\n2x^2 - 6x^2 = -4x^2\n\nNext, let's combine the x terms:\n\n4x - 3x = 1x (or simply x)\n\nNow, we have the simplified expression:\n\n-4x^2 + x + 5"
