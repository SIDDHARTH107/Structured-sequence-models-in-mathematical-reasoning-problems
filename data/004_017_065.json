    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = 2x^(3/2) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^(3/2))/dx = 3x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can find the square of the derivative:\n\n(f'(x))^2 = (3x^(1/2))^2 = 9x\n\nNext, we add 1 to the square of the derivative:\n\n1 + (f'(x))^2 = 1 + 9x\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of the expression:\n\n√(1 + (f'(x))^2) = √(1 + 9x)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral for the arc length:\n\nL = ∫[0, 9] √(1 + 9x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet u = 1 + 9x\nThen, du = 9 dx\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = (1/9) ∫[1, 82] √(u) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (1/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 82]\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nL = (1/9) * (2/3) * (82^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (2/27) * (82^(3/2) - 1)\n\nNow, we can calculate the arc length:\n\nL ≈ (2/27) * (82^(3/2) - 1) ≈ 104.073\n\nThe arc length of the curve over the interval [0, 9] is approximately 104.073 units."
