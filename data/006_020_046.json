    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 320 people drink coffee and 220 people drink tea. What is the probability that a randomly selected person in the community drinks both coffee and tea?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that a person drinks coffee, and B be the event that a person drinks tea. We are given the following information:\n\nP(A) = 320/500 (probability of a person drinking coffee)\nP(B) = 220/500 (probability of a person drinking tea)\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that a person drinks both coffee and tea, which is P(A ∩ B). To find this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∪ B)\n\nHowever, we don't have the value for P(A ∪ B) yet. We know that P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B), and since there are 500 people in the community, the probability of a person being in the union of A and B is:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = (number of people who drink coffee or tea or both) / 500\n\nLet's denote the number of people who drink both coffee and tea as x. Then, we have:\n\n320 (coffee drinkers) + 220 (tea drinkers) - x (both) = number of people who drink coffee or tea or both\n\n320 + 220 - x = number of people who drink coffee or tea or both\n\nSince there are 500 people in the community, and everyone drinks either coffee or tea or both, we have:\n\n320 + 220 - x = 500\n\n540 - x = 500\n\nx = 40\n\nSo, 40 people drink both coffee and tea. Now we can find the probability that a randomly selected person in the community drinks both coffee and tea:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = x / 500 = 40 / 500 = 2 / 25\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected person in the community drinks both coffee and tea is 2/25 or 0.08 (8%)."
