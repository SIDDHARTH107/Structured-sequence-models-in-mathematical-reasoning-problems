    "message_2": "To find the scalar curvature of the surface $M$, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start by finding the tangent plane to the surface $M$ at the point $(1,1,1)$. The gradient of the function $f(x,y,z)$ gives the normal vector to the tangent plane:\n\n$$\\nabla f = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right) = (3x^2 - 3yz, 3y^2 - 3xz, 3z^2 - 3xy).$$\n\nAt the point $(1,1,1)$, we have:\n\n$$\\nabla f(1,1,1) = (0, 0, 0).$$\n\nSince the gradient is zero at this point, the tangent plane is degenerate, and the surface is not well-defined at this point. Therefore, the scalar curvature is not defined at the point $(1,1,1)$."
