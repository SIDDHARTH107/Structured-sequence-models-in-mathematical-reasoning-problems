    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can find the automorphisms by considering the possible permutations of its vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. There are 8 automorphisms for this graph:\n\n1. Identity (no change): (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n2. Horizontal reflection: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n   Swap vertices 1 and 3, and swap vertices 4 and 6: (13)(46)(25)\n3. Vertical reflection: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n   Swap vertices 1 and 4, and swap vertices 3 and 6: (14)(25)(36)\n4. 180-degree rotation: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n   Swap vertices 1 and 6, and swap vertices 3 and 4: (16)(34)(25)\n5. Diagonal reflection along the main diagonal (1-5-6): (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n   Swap vertices 2 and 4, and swap vertices 3 and 5: (24)(35)(16)\n6. Diagonal reflection along the secondary diagonal (3-5-4): (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n   Swap vertices 1 and 2, and swap vertices 4 and 6: (12)(46)(35)\n7. Diagonal reflection along the diagonal (1-2-6): (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n   Swap vertices 3 and 4, and swap vertices 5 and 6: (34)(56)(12)\n8. Diagonal reflection along the diagonal (4-2-3): (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n   Swap vertices 1 and 5, and swap vertices 3 and 6: (15)(36)(24)\n\nThe automorphism group of G is the set of these 8 automorphisms, which forms a group under the composition of permutations. This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, which is the symmetry group of a square."
