    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn our case, we want to find the remainder when 7^63 is divided by 13. Since 13 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^13 ≡ 7 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we can rewrite 7^63 as (7^13)^4 * 7^3. Using the result from Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n(7^13)^4 * 7^3 ≡ 7^4 * 7^3 (mod 13)\n\n7^7 ≡ 7^4 * 7^3 (mod 13)\n\nNow we need to find the remainder of 7^4 and 7^3 when divided by 13:\n\n7^3 = 343 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n7^4 = 2401 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nNow, multiply the remainders:\n\n3 * 1 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^63 is divided by 13 is 3."
