    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to come up with a numerical problem for the subtopic of Deontic logic as it deals with moral and ethical principles and does not involve numerical calculations. It is a branch of logic that deals with norms, obligations, permissions, and prohibitions. Can I assist you with anything else in regards to this topic?",
    "message_2": "Of course! If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask. I'm here to help."
