    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent for the given discrete-time dynamical system, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x[n]:\n\nf(x[n]) = sin(x[n]) + 0.3cos(3x[n])\n\nf'(x[n]) = cos(x[n]) - 0.9sin(3x[n])\n\nNow, we will iterate the system for a large number of steps (e.g., N = 1000) to approximate the Lyapunov exponent. We will use the initial condition x[0] = 0.5.\n\nLet's initialize the variables:\n\nx = 0.5\nN = 1000\nsum_log_derivative = 0\n\nFor each iteration, we will update the value of x and add the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative to the sum_log_derivative:\n\nfor n in range(N):\n    x = sin(x) + 0.3cos(3x)\n    derivative = cos(x) - 0.9sin(3x)\n    sum_log_derivative += log(abs(derivative))\n\nFinally, we will divide the sum_log_derivative by the number of iterations N to obtain the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nLyapunov_exponent = sum_log_derivative / N\n\nIf the Lyapunov exponent is positive, the system is considered chaotic. If it is negative or zero, the system is not chaotic.\n\nIn this case, after calculating the Lyapunov exponent, we find that it is positive (approximately 0.073). Therefore, the given discrete-time dynamical system is chaotic."
