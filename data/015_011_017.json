    "message_1": "What is the maximum angle reached by the first pendulum in a double pendulum system with masses of 1 kg and 2 kg, lengths of 0.5 m and 1 m respectively, starting from the initial configuration where both pendulums are at rest and the first pendulum is at a 45 degree angle from the vertical? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The motion of a double pendulum system is highly complex and cannot be solved analytically for a general case. To find the maximum angle reached by the first pendulum, we would need to use numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to simulate the motion of the system and track the angle of the first pendulum over time.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a qualitative answer. Since the first pendulum starts at a 45-degree angle from the vertical and both pendulums are initially at rest, the first pendulum will initially swing back towards the vertical position. Due to the complex interactions between the two pendulums, it is difficult to predict the exact maximum angle that the first pendulum will reach without running a numerical simulation."
