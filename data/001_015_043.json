    "message_2": "To find the value of x in the exponential equation 3^(x + 2) = 27, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite 27 as a power of 3. Since 3^3 = 27, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3^(x + 2) = 3^3\n\nStep 2: Since the bases are equal (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 2 = 3\n\nStep 3: Solve for x:\n\nx = 3 - 2\nx = 1\n\nSo, the value of x in the exponential equation 3^(x + 2) = 27 is x = 1."
