    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph into two components, we need to find a cut that separates the graph into two non-empty subgraphs. The minimum number of edges that need to be removed to achieve this can be found by considering the minimum degree of the vertices in the graph.\n\nLet's denote the minimum degree of a vertex in the graph as δ(G). According to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in the graph is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) = 2 * |E|\n\nSince there are 10 vertices and 15 edges in the graph, we have:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) = 2 * 15 = 30\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum degree δ(G). If δ(G) = 1, then there exists a vertex with degree 1, which means there is a single edge connected to that vertex. Removing that edge would disconnect the graph into two components.\n\nIf δ(G) > 1, then every vertex has at least two edges connected to it. In this case, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle to find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed. Since there are 10 vertices, there must be at least one vertex with degree greater than or equal to 3 (otherwise, the sum of degrees would be less than 30).\n\nLet's assume there is a vertex with degree 3. Removing all three edges connected to that vertex would disconnect the graph into two components. In the worst case, we would need to remove 3 edges to disconnect the graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed in order to disconnect the graph into two components is 1 if δ(G) = 1, and 3 if δ(G) > 1."
