    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nA car is traveling at a velocity of 20 m/s when the brakes are suddenly applied. The car comes to a stop in 5 seconds. Determine the deceleration of the car, assuming constant deceleration.",
    "message_2": "To determine the deceleration of the car, we can use the formula:\n\ndeceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time\n\nIn this case, the initial velocity (v_initial) is 20 m/s, the final velocity (v_final) is 0 m/s (since the car comes to a stop), and the time (t) is 5 seconds.\n\ndeceleration = (0 - 20) / 5\n\ndeceleration = -20 / 5\n\ndeceleration = -4 m/s²\n\nThe deceleration of the car is -4 m/s². The negative sign indicates that the car is slowing down."
