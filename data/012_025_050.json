    "message_2": "Yes, there is a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph G. A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every node (vertex) is visited exactly once.\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian cycle in G is: A → B → C → F → E → D → A\n\nThis cycle visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex A, forming a closed loop."
