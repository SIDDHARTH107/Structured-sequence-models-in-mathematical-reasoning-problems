    "message_2": "To find the impulse response of the system, we need to compute the inverse Fourier transform of F(jω). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nh(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[F(jω) * e^(jωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nF(jω) = (4 - 5jω) / (1 + jω)^2\n\nFirst, we need to find the poles of F(jω) by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\n(1 + jω)^2 = 0\n\n(1 + jω) = 0\n\nω = -1/j\n\nThe pole is at ω = -1/j. Since the pole is of order 2, we need to find the residue of F(jω) * e^(jωt) at this pole. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nResidue = (d/dω)[(1 + jω)^2 * (4 - 5jω) * e^(jωt)] at ω = -1/j\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to ω:\n\n(d/dω)[(1 + jω)^2 * (4 - 5jω) * e^(jωt)] = 2(1 + jω)(4 - 5jω)e^(jωt) + (1 + jω)^2(-5j)e^(jωt)\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression at ω = -1/j:\n\nResidue = 2(1 - j)(4 + 5) * e^(-t) + (1 - j)^2(-5j) * e^(-t)\n\nResidue = 2(9 - 9j) * e^(-t) - 5j(2 - 2j) * e^(-t)\n\nResidue = (18 - 18j - 10 + 10j) * e^(-t)\n\nResidue = (8 - 8j) * e^(-t)\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to compute the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nh(t) = (1 / 2π) * 2π * Residue\n\nh(t) = (8 - 8j) * e^(-t) * u(t)\n\nwhere u(t) is the unit step function. So, the impulse response of the system is:\n\nh(t) = (8 - 8j) * e^(-t) * u(t)"
