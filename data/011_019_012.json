    "message_1": "An orthomorphism is a subset of orthogonal arrays. Consider an experimental study where five factors, each with three levels, are studied simultaneously. How many experimental runs will be required if we are able to use only orthomorphisms with five factors, each with three levels?",
    "message_2": "In an orthogonal array, the number of experimental runs required can be determined by multiplying the number of levels of each factor. Since there are five factors, each with three levels, the calculation is as follows:\n\n3 (levels) ^ 5 (factors) = 243\n\nTherefore, 243 experimental runs will be required if we are able to use only orthomorphisms with five factors, each with three levels."
