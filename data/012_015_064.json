    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 10, so a connected graph must have at least 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\nSince the graph G has 15 edges, which is greater than the minimum required number of edges (9), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as the edges could be distributed in such a way that some vertices are not connected to the rest of the graph.\n\nTo conclusively determine if the graph G is connected or not, we would need more information about the distribution of the edges among the vertices."
