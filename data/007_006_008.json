    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 64 and 48 using the Euclidean Algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (64) by the smaller number (48) and find the remainder.\n   64 รท 48 = 1 with a remainder of 16.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (64) with the smaller number (48) and the smaller number with the remainder (16).\n   Now we have 48 and 16.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0.\n   48 รท 16 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 16.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 64 and 48 is 16."
