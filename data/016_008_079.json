    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of a self-similar fractal, like the Koch curve, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, at each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 4 new segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, N = 4 and S = 3.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve generated by four iterations, where the initial line has length 1, is approximately 1.2619. Note that the number of iterations does not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it is a property of the fractal itself, not the specific iteration."
