    "message_1": "If the angles of a triangle are 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 45 degrees, and the length of the side opposite the 75 degree angle is 10 cm, what is the perimeter of the triangle? (Round your answer to the nearest hundredth if necessary).",
    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Sines to find the other two sides of the triangle. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\n(side a) / sin(60°) = (side b) / sin(75°) = (side c) / sin(45°)\n\nWe are given the side opposite the 75° angle, which is 10 cm. So, side b = 10 cm. Now we can find the other two sides:\n\n(side a) / sin(60°) = 10 / sin(75°)\n(side a) = 10 * sin(60°) / sin(75°)\n\n(side c) / sin(45°) = 10 / sin(75°)\n(side c) = 10 * sin(45°) / sin(75°)\n\nNow we can calculate the values:\n\nside a = 10 * sin(60°) / sin(75°) ≈ 10 * 0.866 / 0.966 ≈ 8.95 cm\nside c = 10 * sin(45°) / sin(75°) ≈ 10 * 0.707 / 0.966 ≈ 7.32 cm\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = side a + side b + side c ≈ 8.95 + 10 + 7.32 ≈ 26.27 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 26.27 cm."
