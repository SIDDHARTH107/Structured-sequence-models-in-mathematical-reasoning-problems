    "message_2": "We will use the Sylow Theorems to prove this statement.\n\nSince the order of G is 9, we can write it as 3^2. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and also satisfy n_3 â‰¡ 1 (mod 3). The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, say P, in G. By the Sylow Theorems, P is normal in G. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, which is equal to the order of G, we have P = G. Thus, G is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is a direct product of cyclic groups of order p^k for some k. In this case, G is a direct product of cyclic groups of order 3^k, and since the order of G is 9, we have k = 2. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIn this case, there are three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups in G, say P_1, P_2, and P_3. Each of these subgroups has order 3, and since 3 is prime, each of these subgroups is cyclic. Let a_i be a generator of P_i for i = 1, 2, 3. Then, the elements of G can be written as {1, a_1, a_1^2, a_2, a_2^2, a_3, a_3^2, a_1a_2, a_1a_3}.\n\nNow, consider the element a_1a_2 in G. Since a_1 and a_2 are not in the same Sylow 3-subgroup, a_1a_2 cannot be in any of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Therefore, a_1a_2 must be in the remaining two elements of G, which are {a_1a_3, a_1a_2}. Without loss of generality, let a_1a_2 = a_1a_3. Then, a_2 = a_3, which is a contradiction since a_2 and a_3 are generators of distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. Hence, the assumption that G has three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, G must be a cyclic group of order 9, or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3."
