    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we will perform row reduction (also known as Gaussian elimination) to transform the matrix into its row echelon form. Then, the rank will be equal to the number of non-zero rows in the row echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, 2, 1],\n [2, 6, 3],\n [1, 3, 2]]\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 3 to have a non-zero element in the top-left corner.\n\n[[1, 3, 2],\n [2, 6, 3],\n [3, 2, 1]]\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the elements below the top-left element (1) by subtracting multiples of Row 1 from the rows below.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1:\n[[1, 3, 2],\n [0, 0, -1],\n [3, 2, 1]]\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1:\n[[1, 3, 2],\n [0, 0, -1],\n [0, -7, -5]]\n\nStep 3: Swap Row 2 and Row 3 to have a non-zero element in the second row.\n\n[[1, 3, 2],\n [0, -7, -5],\n [0, 0, -1]]\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that all rows are non-zero, so the rank of matrix A is 3."
