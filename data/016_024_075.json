    "message_2": "A Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively subdividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the central square at each step. The total number of squares in a Sierpinski carpet of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nFor a Sierpinski carpet of order 4, we can plug in the value of n into the formula:\n\nTotal squares = (8^4 - 1) / 7\nTotal squares = (4096 - 1) / 7\nTotal squares = 4095 / 7\nTotal squares = 585\n\nSo, there are a total of 585 squares in a Sierpinski carpet of order 4."
