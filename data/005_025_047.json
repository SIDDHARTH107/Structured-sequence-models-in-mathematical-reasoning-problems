    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students who have secured jobs upon graduation, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion:\n\nCI = p ± Z * √(p(1-p)/n)\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- p is the sample proportion (in this case, 0.60 or 60%)\n- Z is the Z-score for the desired confidence level (for a 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.96)\n- n is the sample size (in this case, 500)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nSE = √(p(1-p)/n) = √(0.60 * 0.40 / 500) ≈ 0.02236\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.02236 ≈ 0.04383\n\nFinally, we can determine the confidence interval:\n\nCI = p ± ME = 0.60 ± 0.04383\n\nLower limit: 0.60 - 0.04383 ≈ 0.55617\nUpper limit: 0.60 + 0.04383 ≈ 0.64383\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students who have secured jobs upon graduation is approximately (0.55617, 0.64383) or (55.62%, 64.38%)."
