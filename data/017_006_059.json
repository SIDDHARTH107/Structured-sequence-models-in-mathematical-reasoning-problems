    "message_2": "By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 5 and divides 7. The only possibility is that there is exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup, say P. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 7 and divides 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one 7-Sylow subgroup, say Q.\n\nSince P and Q are the only Sylow subgroups of their respective orders, they must be normal in G. Now, let's consider the product of elements from P and Q. Let p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Then, (pq)^5 = p^5q^5 = e, since P is a 5-Sylow subgroup and Q is a 7-Sylow subgroup. Similarly, (pq)^7 = p^7q^7 = e. Thus, the order of pq divides both 5 and 7, which are prime numbers. The only possibility is that the order of pq is 1, which means pq = e. This implies that p = q^(-1), so p ∈ Q, which is a contradiction since P and Q are distinct subgroups.\n\nTherefore, G cannot be cyclic. Instead, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively. So, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
