    "message_2": "Proof:\n\n(⇒) Suppose X is path-connected. Then for any two points x, y ∈ X, there exists a continuous function g: [0,1] → X such that g(0) = x and g(1) = y. Let x ∈ A and y ∈ B. Then there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) ∈ A and f(1) ∈ B.\n\n(⇐) Suppose there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) ∈ A and f(1) ∈ B. Let x, y ∈ X. If x, y ∈ A or x, y ∈ B, then since A and B are connected, there exists a continuous function g: [0,1] → X such that g(0) = x and g(1) = y. If x ∈ A and y ∈ B, then we can define a continuous function h: [0,1] → X as follows:\n\nh(t) = { g(t) if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2, f(2t-1) if 1/2 < t ≤ 1 },\n\nwhere g: [0,1] → A is a continuous function such that g(0) = x and g(1) = f(0). Then h is a continuous function such that h(0) = x and h(1) = y. Similarly, if x ∈ B and y ∈ A, we can define a continuous function h: [0,1] → X such that h(0) = x and h(1) = y. Therefore, X is path-connected.\n\nNow, consider the given space X = [-3, -1] ∪ [0, 2] ∪ [3, 5] and connected components A = [-3, -1] ∪ [0, 2] and B = [3, 5]. We will construct a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) ∈ A and f(1) ∈ B.\n\nDefine f: [0,1] → X as follows:\n\nf(t) = { -3 + 2t if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2, 3 + 4(t-1/2) if 1/2 < t ≤ 1 }.\n\nThis function is continuous on [0,1] and maps f(0) = -3 ∈ A and f(1) = 5 ∈ B. Thus, by the previous proof, X is path-connected."
