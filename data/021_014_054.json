    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 4x - x^2 using genetic algorithm optimization, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of candidate solutions (x-values) within the given range [0, 4].\n2. Evaluation: Calculate the fitness (f(x)) of each candidate solution.\n3. Selection: Select the fittest individuals (highest f(x) values) to be parents for the next generation.\n4. Crossover: Combine the parents to create offspring by exchanging parts of their x-values.\n5. Mutation: Randomly modify some offspring by changing their x-values slightly.\n6. Replacement: Replace the least fit individuals in the population with the new offspring.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 for a certain number of generations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the genetic algorithm optimization, we will obtain an approximate x-value that maximizes the function f(x) = 4x - x^2.\n\nHowever, as a mathematician, I can find the exact maximum value of the function using calculus. The first derivative of the function is:\n\nf'(x) = 4 - 2x\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n0 = 4 - 2x\nx = 2\n\nNow, we check the second derivative to confirm that this is a maximum:\n\nf''(x) = -2\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point x = 2 is indeed a maximum. Now, we can find the maximum value of the function by plugging x = 2 back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = 4(2) - (2)^2\nf(2) = 8 - 4\nf(2) = 4\n\nThus, the maximum value of the function f(x) = 4x - x^2 is 4 when x = 2."
