    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let the order of G be 27, which can be written as 3^3. According to the first Sylow theorem, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say P, with order 3^3 = 27.\n\nNow, by the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27, and\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. In this case, P is a normal subgroup of G with order 27, so P = G, and G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nIf n_3 = 3, then there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, say P_1, P_2, and P_3. Let H be the subgroup of G generated by the intersection of P_1 and P_2. Since the order of P_1 and P_2 is 27, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of their intersection is either 1, 3, or 9. If the order of H is 1, then P_1 and P_2 are disjoint, which is impossible since the order of G is 27. If the order of H is 3, then H is a normal subgroup of G, and G/H has order 9.\n\nNow, let K be a subgroup of G with order 9 (which must exist by Cauchy's theorem). Then, the order of HK (the product of H and K) is |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 3 * 9 / 1 = 27. Since HK has the same order as G, we have HK = G. Moreover, H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element, so G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K by the internal direct product theorem. Since H is a cyclic group of order 3 and K is a group of order 9, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
