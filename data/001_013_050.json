    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n(√(3x - 4))^2 = 5^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x - 4 = 25\n\nNow, we will isolate x by adding 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\n3x = 29\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 29/3"
