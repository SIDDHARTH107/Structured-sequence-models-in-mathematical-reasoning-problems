    "message_2": "To calculate the Hodge star operator on M at the point p = (1,1), we first need to compute the exterior derivative of the given 1-form w = xdy - ydx.\n\ndw = d(xdy - ydx) = (dxdy + dy^2) - (dxdx + dydx) = dxdy - dydx.\n\nNow, we need to find the Hodge star of dw at the point p = (1,1). In a two-dimensional manifold, the Hodge star operator acts on 1-forms by rotating them 90 degrees counterclockwise and rescaling them by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor g. In this case, since M is a compact two-dimensional manifold with no boundary, we can assume that the metric tensor is the Euclidean metric, i.e., g = diag(1,1), and its determinant is 1.\n\nSo, the Hodge star operator acts on dw as follows:\n\n*dw = * (dxdy - dydx) = dx ∧ dy.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate *dw at the point p = (1,1). Since the Hodge star operator does not depend on the point in this case, we have:\n\n*dw(p) = * (dx ∧ dy) = dx ∧ dy.\n\nGiven that *dw(p) = 5, we can write:\n\ndx ∧ dy = 5.\n\nThus, the Hodge star operator on M at the point p = (1,1) for the given 1-form w = xdy - ydx is:\n\n*dw(p) = 5."
