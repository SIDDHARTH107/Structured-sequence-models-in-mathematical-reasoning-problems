    "message_1": "Here's a possible numerical problem related to the chaotic dynamics of the Henon-Heiles system:\n\nConsider the following Hamiltonian of the Henon-Heiles system:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 0.5(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y - y^3/3\n\nwhere (x, y) are the position coordinates and (p_x, p_y) are the momentum coordinates. We want to study the motion of a particle with mass m = 1 in this potential energy landscape.\n\n(a) Find the equations of motion for this system using Hamilton's equations.\n\n(b) Choose initial conditions corresponding to the particle being at (x_0, y_0) = (1, 0) and moving with momentum p_y = 1, while p_x is set to zero. Integrate the equations of motion numerically using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for a total time T = 100. Plot the trajectory of the particle in the (x, y) plane.\n\n(c) Repeat part (b) for three more sets of initial conditions: (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0.5), (-0.5, 0.5), (-1, 0.5), all with p_y = 1 and p_x = 0. Plot the trajectories of the particles for these cases.\n\n(d) For each of the initial conditions in part (c), calculate the Lyapunov exponent using the formula\n\nlambda = [1/T]ln(dN/N_0)\n\nwhere N_0 is the initial separation between two nearby trajectories and dN is the difference in separation after time T. Use N_0 = 10^-7 for all cases.\n\n(e) Discuss the qualitative behavior of the trajectories and the values of the Lyapunov exponents obtained in part (d). Does the system exhibit chaotic motion?",
