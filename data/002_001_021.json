    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 8 cm and a height of 6 cm. Find its area in square centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 * 6) / 2\n\nArea = 48 / 2\n\nArea = 24 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 24 square centimeters."
