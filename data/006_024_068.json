    "message_2": "To find the probability of a traveler experiencing either a delayed or cancelled flight, we simply add the probabilities of each event occurring:\n\nProbability of delayed flight = 25%\nProbability of cancelled flight = 10%\n\nProbability of delayed or cancelled flight = 25% + 10% = 35%\n\nSo, the probability that a traveler will experience either a delayed or cancelled flight on that day is 35%."
