    "message_1": "In a chemical factory, the probability that an accident involving a chemical spill occurs in a given week is 0.35. What is the probability that no such accidents will occur in the next two weeks?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that no accidents will occur in the next two weeks, we first need to find the probability that no accident occurs in a single week. Since the probability of an accident occurring is 0.35, the probability of no accident occurring is 1 - 0.35 = 0.65.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that no accidents occur in two consecutive weeks. Since the weeks are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities of no accidents occurring in each week:\n\nProbability (no accidents in 2 weeks) = Probability (no accidents in week 1) × Probability (no accidents in week 2)\n= 0.65 × 0.65\n= 0.4225\n\nSo, the probability that no accidents will occur in the next two weeks is 0.4225."
