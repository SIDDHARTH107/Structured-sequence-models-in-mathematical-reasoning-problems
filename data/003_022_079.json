    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors A and B, we use the formula:\n\nA 路 B = (A_x * B_x) + (A_y * B_y)\n\nwhere A_x and A_y are the x and y components of vector A, and B_x and B_y are the x and y components of vector B.\n\nGiven the vectors A = (3, 5) and B = (2, 4), we can find the dot product as follows:\n\nA 路 B = (3 * 2) + (5 * 4)\nA 路 B = 6 + 20\nA 路 B = 26\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors A and B is 26."
