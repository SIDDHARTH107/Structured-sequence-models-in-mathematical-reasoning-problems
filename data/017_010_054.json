Prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5 or the non-abelian group of order 10 by finding the particular group structure and explicitly verifying that it matches one of the structures of the groups mentioned above.",
    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems and then verify that they match the structures of the mentioned groups.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide the order of G, which is 10. Also, n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5).\n\nFor n_2, the possible values are 1 and 5. For n_5, the only possible value is 1. Let P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nSince P is unique, it is normal in G. If Q is also unique, then it is normal in G, and G is a direct product of P and Q. In this case, G is isomorphic to C10, the cyclic group of order 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where n_2 = 5. In this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and Q is not unique. Let's analyze the structure of G in this case.\n\nSince |P| = 5 and |Q| = 2, P is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5, and Q is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2. Let a be a generator of P and b be a generator of Q. Then, G can be generated by a and b, and we have the following relations:\n\na^5 = e, b^2 = e, and |G| = 10.\n\nNow, we need to determine the product of a and b. Since P is normal in G, we have:\n\nbab^(-1) = b(ab)b = ba^i, for some i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nSince b^2 = e, we have:\n\nba = a^i b.\n\nNow, we will consider two cases:\n\n1. i = 1 (abelian case): In this case, ba = ab, and G is an abelian group. However, we already covered the abelian case when G is isomorphic to C10. So, this case does not give us a new group structure.\n\n2. i ≠ 1 (non-abelian case): Without loss of generality, let i = 2. Then, we have the following relations:\n\na^5 = e, b^2 = e, and ba = a^2 b.\n\nThese relations define the non-abelian group of order 10. This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, which is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. To see this, we can think of a as a rotation by 72 degrees and b as a reflection about an axis of symmetry. Then, the above relations hold, and G has the same structure as D5.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a group G of order 10 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10."
