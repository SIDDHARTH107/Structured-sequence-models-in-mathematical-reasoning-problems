    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety X, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xyz. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the singular points.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express yz as:\n\nyz = x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression into the second equation:\n\ny^2 - x(x^2) = 0\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny(y - x^3) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n\n1) y = 0: In this case, the first equation becomes x^2 = 0, which implies x = 0. So, we have the singular point (0, 0).\n\n2) y - x^3 = 0: In this case, we have y = x^3. Substituting this back into the expression for yz, we get:\n\nx^3 * z = x^2\n\nIf x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by x^2:\n\nz = x\n\nSo, for any x ≠ 0, we have y = x^3 and z = x. This gives us an infinite family of singular points parametrized by x: (x, x^3, x).\n\nIn conclusion, the singular points of the algebraic variety X are (0, 0) and the points (x, x^3, x) for any x ≠ 0."
