What is the probability that a randomly selected student has either blue eyes or is left-handed (or both)?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a student having either blue eyes or being left-handed (or both), we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A represents the event of having blue eyes, B represents the event of being left-handed, and A ∩ B represents the event of having blue eyes and being left-handed.\n\nGiven the probabilities:\nP(A) = 0.25 (probability of having blue eyes)\nP(B) = 0.15 (probability of being left-handed)\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.05 (probability of having blue eyes and being left-handed)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.25 + 0.15 - 0.05 = 0.35\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student has either blue eyes or is left-handed (or both) is 0.35 or 35%."
