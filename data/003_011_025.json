Meanwhile, from the same point, the angle of elevation to the top of a nearby tree is 30 degrees. Find the distance between the building and the tree, to the nearest meter, assuming that the tree is shorter than the building.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the point on the ground and the building as x meters, and the distance between the building and the tree as y meters. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles of elevation to the heights and distances.\n\nFor the building:\ntan(45°) = (100 m) / x\nSince tan(45°) = 1, we have x = 100 m.\n\nFor the tree:\nLet's denote the height of the tree as h meters. Then,\ntan(30°) = h / (x + y)\nSince tan(30°) = 1/√3, we have h = (x + y) / √3.\n\nNow, we know that the tree is shorter than the building, so h < 100 m. We can substitute the expression for h from the second equation into this inequality:\n\n(x + y) / √3 < 100\nx + y < 100√3\n\nWe already know that x = 100 m, so:\n\n100 + y < 100√3\ny < 100(√3 - 1)\n\nNow, we can find the value of y:\n\ny < 100(1.732 - 1)\ny < 100(0.732)\ny < 73.2\n\nSince we want the distance to the nearest meter, we have y ≈ 73 meters. So, the distance between the building and the tree is approximately 73 meters."
