    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of passing through exactly k red lights\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of traffic signals (in this case, 15)\n- k is the number of red lights passed (0, 1, or 2)\n- p is the probability of passing a red light (0.08)\n- (1-p) is the probability of not passing a red light (0.92)\n\nWe want to find the probability of passing through at most 2 red lights, so we need to calculate the probabilities for k = 0, 1, and 2, and then sum them up.\n\nFor k = 0:\nP(X = 0) = C(15, 0) * (0.08)^0 * (0.92)^15\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.92^15 ≈ 0.196\n\nFor k = 1:\nP(X = 1) = C(15, 1) * (0.08)^1 * (0.92)^14\nP(X = 1) = 15 * 0.08 * 0.92^14 ≈ 0.375\n\nFor k = 2:\nP(X = 2) = C(15, 2) * (0.08)^2 * (0.92)^13\nP(X = 2) = 105 * 0.08^2 * 0.92^13 ≈ 0.299\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities for k = 0, 1, and 2:\nP(X ≤ 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\nP(X ≤ 2) ≈ 0.196 + 0.375 + 0.299 ≈ 0.870\n\nSo, the probability that the car will pass through at most 2 red lights is approximately 0.870 or 87%."
