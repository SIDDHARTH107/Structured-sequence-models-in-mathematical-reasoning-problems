    "message_1": "In a group of 50 students, 25 study French, 18 study Spanish and 10 study both languages. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, how many students in the group do not study either French or Spanish?",
    "message_2": "Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can find the number of students who study either French or Spanish or both by adding the number of students who study French and the number of students who study Spanish, and then subtracting the number of students who study both languages.\n\nNumber of students who study either French or Spanish or both = (Number of students who study French) + (Number of students who study Spanish) - (Number of students who study both languages)\n\n= 25 (French) + 18 (Spanish) - 10 (Both)\n\n= 43 - 10\n\n= 33\n\nNow, to find the number of students who do not study either French or Spanish, we subtract the number of students who study either French or Spanish or both from the total number of students in the group.\n\nNumber of students who do not study either French or Spanish = (Total number of students) - (Number of students who study either French or Spanish or both)\n\n= 50 - 33\n\n= 17\n\nSo, 17 students in the group do not study either French or Spanish."
