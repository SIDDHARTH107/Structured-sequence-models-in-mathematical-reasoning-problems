    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection for M with respect to ω at the point p = (1,1,1), we first need to compute the exterior derivative dω. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form, and it is given by:\n\ndω = (∂ω_i / ∂x_j - ∂ω_j / ∂x_i) dx_i ∧ dx_j\n\nwhere ω = ω_i dx_i and the indices i and j run over the coordinates x_1, x_2, x_3 (in our case, x, y, and z).\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of ω:\n\n∂ω/∂x = ∂((x + y) dx + (x - y) dy + (2z - x - y) dz)/∂x\n       = ∂(x + y)/∂x dx + ∂(x - y)/∂x dy + ∂(2z - x - y)/∂x dz\n       = 1 dx + 1 dy - 1 dz\n\n∂ω/∂y = ∂((x + y) dx + (x - y) dy + (2z - x - y) dz)/∂y\n       = ∂(x + y)/∂y dx + ∂(x - y)/∂y dy + ∂(2z - x - y)/∂y dz\n       = 1 dx - 1 dy - 1 dz\n\n∂ω/∂z = ∂((x + y) dx + (x - y) dy + (2z - x - y) dz)/∂z\n       = ∂(x + y)/∂z dx + ∂(x - y)/∂z dy + ∂(2z - x - y)/∂z dz\n       = 0 dx + 0 dy + 2 dz\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivative dω:\n\ndω = (∂ω/∂x - ∂ω/∂y) dx ∧ dy + (∂ω/∂x - ∂ω/∂z) dx ∧ dz + (∂ω/∂y - ∂ω/∂z) dy ∧ dz\n    = (1 - (-1)) dx ∧ dy + (1 - 0) dx ∧ dz + (-1 - 2) dy ∧ dz\n    = 2 dx ∧ dy + dx ∧ dz - 3 dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, we can compute the Cartan connection Γ at the point p = (1,1,1). The Cartan connection is a 1-form valued in the Lie algebra of the tangent space at p, and it is given by:\n\nΓ = ω + dω\n\nAt the point p = (1,1,1), we have:\n\nω(p) = (1 + 1) dx + (1 - 1) dy + (2 - 1 - 1) dz\n     = 2 dx + 0 dy + 0 dz\n\nSo, the Cartan connection Γ at p = (1,1,1) is:\n\nΓ(p) = ω(p) + dω\n     = 2 dx + 0 dy + 0 dz + 2 dx ∧ dy + dx ∧ dz - 3 dy ∧ dz\n\nThus, the Cartan connection for M with respect to ω at the point p = (1,1,1) is:\n\nΓ(p) = 2 dx + 2 dx ∧ dy + dx ∧ dz - 3 dy ∧ dz"
