    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from Node 1 to Node 6, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will iteratively find augmenting paths from the source (Node 1) to the sink (Node 6) and update the capacities of the edges along the path until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Initialize the flow in each edge to 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path from Node 1 to Node 6:\n\n   Path 1: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6\n\n   The minimum capacity along this path is 10 (edge 2 -> 4). Update the flow in each edge along the path:\n\n   - Edge 1 -> 2: flow = 10\n   - Edge 2 -> 4: flow = 10\n   - Edge 4 -> 6: flow = 10\n\n3. Find another augmenting path:\n\n   Path 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6\n\n   The minimum capacity along this path is 10 (edge 3 -> 4). Update the flow in each edge along the path:\n\n   - Edge 1 -> 3: flow = 10\n   - Edge 3 -> 4: flow = 10\n   - Edge 4 -> 6: flow = 20 (10 from previous path + 10 from this path)\n\n4. Find another augmenting path:\n\n   Path 3: 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6\n\n   The minimum capacity along this path is 10 (edge 2 -> 5). Update the flow in each edge along the path:\n\n   - Edge 1 -> 2: flow = 20 (10 from previous path + 10 from this path)\n   - Edge 2 -> 5: flow = 10\n   - Edge 5 -> 6: flow = 10\n\n5. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow from Node 1 to Node 6 is the sum of the flows in the edges leaving Node 1, which is 20 + 10 = 30."
