    "message_1": "What is the probability of an earthquake with magnitude 7 or higher occurring within a 50-mile radius of a given city within the next 10 years, if the historical average frequency of such earthquakes is once every 40 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, earthquakes with magnitude 7 or higher) occurring in a fixed interval of time (10 years) given a known average rate (1 earthquake every 40 years).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X=k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events (in this case, λ = 10 years / 40 years = 0.25 earthquakes in 10 years)\n- k is the number of events we are interested in (in this case, k = 1, since we want to find the probability of at least one earthquake)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we will calculate the probability of no earthquakes (k=0) occurring within the next 10 years:\n\nP(X=0) = (0.25^0 * e^(-0.25)) / 0! = (1 * e^(-0.25)) / 1 = e^(-0.25) ≈ 0.7788\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one earthquake (k ≥ 1) occurring within the next 10 years. This is equal to 1 minus the probability of no earthquakes:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - 0.7788 ≈ 0.2212\n\nSo, the probability of an earthquake with magnitude 7 or higher occurring within a 50-mile radius of a given city within the next 10 years is approximately 22.12%."
