    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 3x - 1, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a0, an, and bn. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ[an * cos(nx) + bn * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nWe can find the coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to 2π\nan = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\nbn = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nFirst, let's find a0:\n\na0 = (1/π) * ∫[(3x - 1) dx] from 0 to 2π\na0 = (1/π) * [(3/2)x^2 - x] from 0 to 2π\na0 = (1/π) * [(3/2)(2π)^2 - 2π]\na0 = (1/π) * (6π^2 - 2π)\na0 = 6π - 2\n\nNow, let's find an:\n\nan = (1/π) * ∫[(3x - 1) * cos(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\nan = (1/π) * [(3x - 1) * (1/n) * sin(nx) - (3/n) * ∫[sin(nx) dx]] from 0 to 2π\nan = (1/π) * [(3x - 1) * (1/n) * sin(nx) + (3/n^2) * cos(nx)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\nan = (1/π) * [(3(2π) - 1) * (1/n) * sin(2πn) + (3/n^2) * cos(2πn) - (3/n^2) * cos(0)]\nan = (1/π) * [0 + (3/n^2) * (1 - 1)]\nan = 0\n\nFinally, let's find bn:\n\nbn = (1/π) * ∫[(3x - 1) * sin(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\nbn = (1/π) * [-(3x - 1) * (1/n) * cos(nx) - (3/n) * ∫[-cos(nx) dx]] from 0 to 2π\nbn = (1/π) * [-(3x - 1) * (1/n) * cos(nx) + (3/n^2) * sin(nx)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\nbn = (1/π) * [-(3(2π) - 1) * (1/n) * cos(2πn) + (3/n^2) * sin(2πn) - (3/n^2) * sin(0)]\nbn = (1/π) * [-(6π - 1) * (1/n) + 0]\nbn = (1/π) * [(1 - 6π)/n]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = 3x - 1:\n\nf(x) = (6π - 2)/2 + Σ[0 * cos(nx) + ((1 - 6π)/n) * sin(nx)]\n\nSo, the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = 3π - 1 + Σ[((1 - 6π)/n) * sin(nx)] for n = 1 to infinity"
