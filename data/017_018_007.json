    "message_2": "There are 51 groups of order 32, but we need to find the non-abelian ones. Since there are 5 abelian groups of order 32, there are 51 - 5 = 46 non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nTo describe their structures, we can use the Sylow theorems and the fact that a group of order 32 is a p-group with p = 2. The groups can be classified based on their nilpotency class and their derived series.\n\n1. There are 14 non-abelian groups of order 32 with nilpotency class 2. These groups have a central series of length 3, and their derived series have length 2. They can be represented as semidirect products of the form 2^(1+2+4) ⋊ 2^1.\n\n2. There are 15 non-abelian groups of order 32 with nilpotency class 3. These groups have a central series of length 4, and their derived series have length 3. They can be represented as semidirect products of the form 2^(1+2+2+4) ⋊ 2^1.\n\n3. There are 9 non-abelian groups of order 32 with nilpotency class 4. These groups have a central series of length 5, and their derived series have length 4. They can be represented as semidirect products of the form 2^(1+1+2+2+4) ⋊ 2^1.\n\n4. There are 8 non-abelian groups of order 32 with nilpotency class 5. These groups have a central series of length 6, and their derived series have length 5. They can be represented as semidirect products of the form 2^(1+1+1+2+2+4) ⋊ 2^1.\n\nIn summary, there are 46 non-abelian groups of order 32, and they can be classified based on their nilpotency class and derived series."
