What would be the truth value of the following proposition: \"If it is sunny today, then I will go for a walk\"?",
    "message_2": "The given proposition can be represented as an implication: P â†’ Q. The truth value of an implication is false only when the antecedent (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is false. In this case, P is true and Q is false, so the truth value of the proposition \"If it is sunny today, then I will go for a walk\" is false."
