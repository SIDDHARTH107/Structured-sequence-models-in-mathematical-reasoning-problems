    "message_2": "To find all solutions to the equation cos(2x) - sin(x) = 0 on the interval [0, 2π], we can first use the double angle formula for cosine:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x)\n\nNow, substitute this into the original equation:\n\n1 - 2sin^2(x) - sin(x) = 0\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n2sin^2(x) + sin(x) - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in sin(x). Let y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 + y - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 1, and c = -1:\n\ny = (-(1) ± √((1)^2 - 4(2)(-1))) / (2(2))\ny = (-1 ± √(1 + 8)) / 4\ny = (-1 ± √9) / 4\ny = (-1 ± 3) / 4\n\nThere are two possible values for y:\n\ny1 = (-1 + 3) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\ny2 = (-1 - 3) / 4 = -4 / 4 = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that correspond to these values of y (sin(x)):\n\n1) sin(x) = 1/2\nx = arcsin(1/2)\nx = π/6, 5π/6 (in the interval [0, 2π])\n\n2) sin(x) = -1\nx = arcsin(-1)\nx = 3π/2 (in the interval [0, 2π])\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation cos(2x) - sin(x) = 0 on the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = π/6, 5π/6, 3π/2"
