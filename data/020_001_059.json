    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: product A and product B. One unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while one unit of product B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The factory has 1000 hours of labor available per week and 2400 hours of machine time available per week. If the profit margins on product A and product B are $50 and $75 per unit, respectively, how many units of each product should the factory produce per week to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for labor and machine time can be written as:\n\n2x + y ≤ 1000 (labor constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 2400 (machine time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 50x + 75y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\ny ≤ -2x + 1000 (labor constraint)\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 800 (machine time constraint)\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both constraints are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n(0, 0), (0, 800), (600, 0), and (400, 600)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 75(0) = $0\nP(0, 800) = 50(0) + 75(800) = $60,000\nP(600, 0) = 50(600) + 75(0) = $30,000\nP(400, 600) = 50(400) + 75(600) = $65,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $65,000, which occurs when the factory produces 400 units of product A and 600 units of product B per week."
