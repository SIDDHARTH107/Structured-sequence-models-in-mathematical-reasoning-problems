    "message_2": "There are 20 marbles in total, and 15 of them are blue. Therefore, there must be 20 - 15 = 5 red marbles in the jar. The probability of randomly selecting a red marble is the ratio of the number of red marbles to the total number of marbles. So, the probability is 5 red marbles / 20 total marbles = 1/4 or 0.25 (25%)."
