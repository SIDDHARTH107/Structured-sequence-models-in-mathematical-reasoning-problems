    "message_2": "First, we will show that H and K are normal subgroups of G. Since the order of H is 5 and the order of K is 3, both orders are prime. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Therefore, the index of H in G is [G:H] = 30/5 = 6, and the index of K in G is [G:K] = 30/3 = 10.\n\nNow, we will use the fact that if the index of a subgroup is the smallest prime dividing the order of the group, then the subgroup is normal. Since 5 and 3 are the smallest primes dividing the order of G (30), both H and K are normal subgroups of G.\n\nNext, we will show that G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C30, D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30. Since H and K are normal subgroups of G, we can consider the product HK. Note that the orders of H and K are relatively prime (gcd(3,5) = 1), so by the second isomorphism theorem, we have:\n\n|HK| = |H||K|/|H âˆ© K| = 5 * 3 / 1 = 15.\n\nNow, we know that HK is a subgroup of G with order 15. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group, so the index of HK in G is [G:HK] = 30/15 = 2. Since the index of HK is 2, HK is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we consider the following possibilities:\n\n1. G is abelian: In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which is a cyclic group of order 30 (C30).\n\n2. G is non-abelian: In this case, we have two possibilities:\n\n  a. G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of H and K, which is the dihedral group of order 30 (D15).\n\n  b. G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 30 that is not a semidirect product of H and K.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that H and K are normal subgroups of G, and G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C30, D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
