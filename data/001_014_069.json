    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √12 - √27, we need to break down the square roots into their simplest radical form.\n\n√12 can be factored as √(4 * 3), and since √4 is 2, we can rewrite it as 2√3.\n\n√27 can be factored as √(9 * 3), and since √9 is 3, we can rewrite it as 3√3.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the original expression as:\n\n2√3 - 3√3\n\nSince both terms have the same radical (√3), we can combine them:\n\n(2 - 3)√3 = -1√3\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n-√3"
