    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we first need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. \n\nStep 1: Find the eigenvalues\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[3 - λ, 4], [5, 8 - λ]]\n\nThe determinant of A - λI is:\n\n(3 - λ)(8 - λ) - (4)(5) = λ^2 - 11λ + 4\n\nSolving the quadratic equation for λ, we get:\n\nλ1 = 1 and λ2 = 4\n\nStep 2: Find the eigenvectors\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n[[2, 4], [5, 7]]v1 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\n2x + 4y = 0\n5x + 7y = 0\n\nSolving the system, we get the eigenvector v1 = [-2, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 4:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n[[-1, 4], [5, 4]]v2 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\n-x + 4y = 0\n5x + 4y = 0\n\nSolving the system, we get the eigenvector v2 = [4, 1].\n\nStep 3: Form the matrix P and the diagonal matrix D\nNow that we have the eigenvectors, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [[-2, 4], [1, 1]]\n\nThe diagonal matrix D will have the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nD = [[1, 0], [0, 4]]\n\nStep 4: Verify A = PDP^(-1)\nTo verify that A = PDP^(-1), we need to find the inverse of P, P^(-1), and then multiply the matrices in the given order.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of P:\n\nP = [[-2, 4], [1, 1]]\n\nThe determinant of P is:\n\ndet(P) = (-2)(1) - (4)(1) = -6\n\nThe adjugate of P is:\n\nadj(P) = [[1, -4], [-1, -2]]\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of P:\n\nP^(-1) = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = (-1/6) * [[1, -4], [-1, -2]]\nP^(-1) = [[-1/6, 2/3], [1/6, 1/3]]\n\nNow, let's multiply the matrices P, D, and P^(-1) in the given order:\n\nPDP^(-1) = [[-2, 4], [1, 1]] * [[1, 0], [0, 4]] * [[-1/6, 2/3], [1/6, 1/3]]\nPDP^(-1) = [[-2, 16], [1, 4]] * [[-1/6, 2/3], [1/6, 1/3]]\nPDP^(-1) = [[3, 4], [5, 8]]\n\nAs we can see, the result is the original matrix A. Therefore, we have successfully diagonalized the matrix A:\n\nA = PDP^(-1) = [[-2, 4], [1, 1]] * [[1, 0], [0, 4]] * [[-1/6, 2/3], [1/6, 1/3]]"
