    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation of the sun, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the tree is the side opposite the angle, and the shadow is the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet θ be the angle of elevation of the sun. Then,\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = (tree height) / (shadow length)\ntan(θ) = 50 ft / 80 ft\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ whose tangent is 50/80. To do this, we'll use the inverse tangent function (also called arctangent or tan^(-1)):\n\nθ = arctan(50/80)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nθ ≈ 32.01°\n\nSo, the angle of elevation of the sun is approximately 32.01°."
