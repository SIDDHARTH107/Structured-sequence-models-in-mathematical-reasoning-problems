    "message_2": "To find the derivative of h(x) = f(x)g(x) using the product rule, we first need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 is:\nf'(x) = 6x\n\nThe derivative of g(x) = 4x + 1 is:\ng'(x) = 4\n\nNow we can apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In this case, we have:\n\nh'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)\n\nSubstituting the derivatives and functions we found earlier:\n\nh'(x) = (6x)(4x + 1) + (3x^2)(4)\n\nNow we can simplify:\n\nh'(x) = 24x^2 + 6x + 12x^2\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nh'(x) = 36x^2 + 6x\n\nSo the derivative of h(x) = f(x)g(x) is h'(x) = 36x^2 + 6x."
