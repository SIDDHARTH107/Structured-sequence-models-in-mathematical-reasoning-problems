    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a numerical problem for a math student studying vibrations and oscillations in mechanical systems:\n\nA mass-spring system consists of a 2 kg mass attached to a spring with a spring constant of 100 N/m. The system is set in motion with an initial displacement of 5 cm and an initial velocity of -2 m/s. Find the amplitude, period, frequency, and equation of motion of the system.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first find the amplitude, period, and frequency of the system, and then we'll write the equation of motion.\n\n1. Amplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the initial displacement is given as 5 cm, which is equal to 0.05 m. Since the mass is initially moving towards the equilibrium position with a velocity of -2 m/s, the amplitude will be greater than the initial displacement. To find the amplitude, we'll first need to find the total mechanical energy of the system.\n\nTotal mechanical energy (E) = Kinetic energy (K) + Potential energy (U)\nK = (1/2)mv^2\nU = (1/2)kx^2\n\nE = (1/2)(2 kg)(-2 m/s)^2 + (1/2)(100 N/m)(0.05 m)^2\nE = (1/2)(2)(4) + (1/2)(100)(0.0025)\nE = 4 + 0.125\nE = 4.125 J\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude (A) using the total mechanical energy:\nE = (1/2)kA^2\nA^2 = (2E)/k\nA = sqrt((2E)/k)\n\nA = sqrt((2 * 4.125 J) / (100 N/m))\nA = sqrt(0.0825 m^2)\nA ≈ 0.287 m\n\n2. Period (T) and Frequency (f):\nThe period is the time it takes for the mass to complete one full oscillation. The frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time. For a mass-spring system, the period and frequency can be found using the following formulas:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt(m/k)\nf = 1/T\n\nT = 2π * sqrt(2 kg / 100 N/m)\nT ≈ 0.894 s\n\nf = 1/T\nf ≈ 1.119 Hz\n\n3. Equation of motion:\nThe equation of motion for a mass-spring system can be written as:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle. The angular frequency can be found using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nω = sqrt(100 N/m / 2 kg)\nω ≈ 7.071 rad/s\n\nTo find the phase angle (φ), we'll use the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.05 m\nv(0) = -ω * A * sin(φ) = -2 m/s\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\ncos(φ) = 0.05 m / 0.287 m\nφ ≈ 1.047 rad\n\nNow, we can write the equation of motion:\n\nx(t) = 0.287 m * cos(7.071 rad/s * t + 1.047 rad)\n\nSo, the amplitude is approximately 0.287 m, the period is approximately 0.894 s, the frequency is approximately 1.119 Hz, and the equation of motion is x(t) = 0.287 m * cos(7.071 rad/s * t + 1.047 rad)."
