    "message_2": "First, let's find A ∩ B. Since A and B have no common elements, their intersection is the empty set:\n\nA ∩ B = ∅\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) x C:\n\n(∅ x C) = ∅, because the Cartesian product of an empty set with any set is an empty set.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products A x C and B x C:\n\nA x C = {(1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7)}\nB x C = {(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these two Cartesian products, (A x C) ∩ (B x C):\n\nSince there are no common ordered pairs in A x C and B x C, their intersection is also the empty set:\n\n(A x C) ∩ (B x C) = ∅\n\nNow, we can see that (A ∩ B) x C = ∅ and (A x C) ∩ (B x C) = ∅, which means they are equal.\n\nTo prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection, let's consider two sets X and Y and their intersection with a set Z:\n\n(X ∩ Y) x Z = (X x Z) ∩ (Y x Z)\n\nWe have shown this to be true for the specific example of A, B, and C above. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product is distributive over intersection, as the results are equal."
