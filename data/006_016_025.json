    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces light bulbs and tests them for defects. The probability of a bulb having a certain type of defect is 0.05. If the company produces 1000 bulbs, what is the probability that at least 50 bulbs will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective bulbs\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective bulbs from n total bulbs (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of bulbs (1000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs (we want to find the probability of having at least 50 defective bulbs)\n- p is the probability of a bulb having a defect (0.05 in this case)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at least 50 defective bulbs, we need to find the sum of probabilities for having 50, 51, 52, ..., 1000 defective bulbs. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nP(X >= 50) = 1 - P(X < 50) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 49\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to find the sum of probabilities for having 0 to 49 defective bulbs:\n\nΣ P(X = k) = Σ [C(1000, k) * (0.05)^k * (1-0.05)^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 49\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean μ = n*p and variance σ^2 = n*p*(1-p). In this case:\n\nμ = 1000 * 0.05 = 50\nσ^2 = 1000 * 0.05 * (1-0.05) = 47.5\nσ = √47.5 ≈ 6.89\n\nNow, we want to find the probability P(X >= 50). Using the normal approximation, we can standardize the value and find the corresponding z-score:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ = (50 - 50) / 6.89 = 0\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that P(Z >= 0) = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of having at least 50 defective bulbs is approximately 0.5 or 50%."
