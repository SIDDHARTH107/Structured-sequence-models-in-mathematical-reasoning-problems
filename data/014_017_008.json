    "message_1": "In a secret message encrypted using the Caesar Cipher, the letter \"E\" is replaced with \"H\". If the encrypted message is \"TVILY VMVUL\", how many times does the letter \"L\" appear in the original message before encryption?",
    "message_2": "To find out how many times the letter \"L\" appears in the original message before encryption, we first need to decrypt the message. Since \"E\" is replaced with \"H\", we can determine that the Caesar Cipher has a shift of 3 (H is 3 positions after E in the alphabet).\n\nNow, we will decrypt the message \"TVILY VMVUL\" by shifting each letter back by 3 positions:\n\nT -> Q\nV -> S\nI -> F\nL -> I\nY -> V\n(space)\nV -> S\nM -> J\nV -> S\nU -> R\nL -> I\n\nThe decrypted message is \"QSIVV SJSRI\". Now we can count the occurrences of the letter \"L\" in the original message. In this case, there are no occurrences of the letter \"L\" in the decrypted message."
