    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, workers being injured), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, n is the total number of trials (workers), p is the probability of success (injury), and k is the number of successes (injured workers).\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 3 workers being injured, so we need to find the probability of 3, 4, 5, ..., 60 workers being injured and sum those probabilities. Alternatively, we can find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 workers being injured and subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 workers being injured:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(60, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(60-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(60, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(60-1)\nP(X = 2) = C(60, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (1-0.05)^(60-2)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute these values:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.046\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.173\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.309\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 3 workers being injured by subtracting the sum of these probabilities from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2))\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (0.046 + 0.173 + 0.309)\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 1 - 0.528\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 0.472\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 workers will be injured is approximately 0.472 or 47.2%."
