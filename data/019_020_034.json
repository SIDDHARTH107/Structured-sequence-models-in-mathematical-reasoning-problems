    "message_1": "Suppose we have a binary string of length n (consisting of only 0's and 1's). What is the maximum number of different strings we can generate using at most k queries (a query asks whether a particular substring of the string is all 0's or all 1's)?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. If k = 0, we can't make any queries, so we can generate only 1 string (the original string).\n\n2. If k = 1, we can make one query. We can ask if a substring of length 1 is all 0's or all 1's. This will give us information about one position in the string. Since there are two possibilities for each position (0 or 1), we can generate 2 different strings.\n\n3. If k = 2, we can make two queries. We can ask if two non-overlapping substrings of length 1 are all 0's or all 1's. This will give us information about two positions in the string. Since there are two possibilities for each position (0 or 1), we can generate 2^2 = 4 different strings.\n\nIn general, for k queries, we can ask about k non-overlapping substrings of length 1. This will give us information about k positions in the string. Since there are two possibilities for each position (0 or 1), we can generate 2^k different strings.\n\nHowever, there is a limitation: the length of the string is n. If k > n, we can't ask about more than n non-overlapping substrings of length 1. In this case, the maximum number of different strings we can generate is 2^n.\n\nSo, the answer to the problem is:\n\n- If k â‰¤ n, the maximum number of different strings is 2^k.\n- If k > n, the maximum number of different strings is 2^n."
