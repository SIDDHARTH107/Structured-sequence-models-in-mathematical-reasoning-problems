    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10cm and a leg of length 6cm. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10 cm) and the length of one leg (a = 6 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem formula is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe can plug in the given values:\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\n100 - 36 = b^2\n64 = b^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg (b) is 8 cm."
