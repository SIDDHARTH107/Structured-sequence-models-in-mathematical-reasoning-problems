    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each line segment is divided into four segments, each of which is 1/3 the length of the original segment. Therefore, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619."
