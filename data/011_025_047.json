    "message_1": "Suppose you are playing a game where you start with 21 points, and on each turn, you must choose to subtract either 1, 2, or 3 points. The game ends when you reach 0 points. If you go first, what is the optimal sequence of moves to ensure that you win the game?",
    "message_2": "To ensure a win in this game, you should aim to leave your opponent with a multiple of 4 points after each of your turns. This way, no matter what move they make (subtracting 1, 2, or 3 points), you can always respond by subtracting enough points to bring the total back to a multiple of 4. By doing this, you will eventually force your opponent to take the last turn when there are only 1, 2, or 3 points left, ensuring your victory.\n\nHere's the optimal sequence of moves:\n\n1. Start with 21 points.\n2. Subtract 1 point (20 points remaining).\n3. Your opponent subtracts 1, 2, or 3 points (19, 18, or 17 points remaining).\n4. If your opponent subtracted 1 point, you subtract 3 points (16 points remaining).\n   If your opponent subtracted 2 points, you subtract 2 points (16 points remaining).\n   If your opponent subtracted 3 points, you subtract 1 point (16 points remaining).\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you reach 4 points remaining.\n6. At this point, no matter what move your opponent makes, they will be left with 1, 2, or 3 points, and you will win the game."
