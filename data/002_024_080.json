    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm, one base of 12 cm, and a sum of the lengths of its two sides 24 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the other base be b cm, and the lengths of the two non-parallel sides be x cm and y cm. We are given that the sum of the lengths of the two non-parallel sides is 24 cm, so x + y = 24.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the non-parallel sides. Let the trapezium be ABCD, where AB and CD are the bases, and AD and BC are the non-parallel sides. Let E be the point on CD such that AE is perpendicular to CD.\n\nSince AE is perpendicular to CD, triangle AED is a right triangle. We have DE = b - 12 (since AB = 12 cm), AE = 8 cm (the height of the trapezium), and AD = x cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 = 8^2 + (b - 12)^2\n\nSimilarly, for the right triangle BEC, we have:\n\ny^2 = 8^2 + (12)^2\n\nNow, we know that x + y = 24. We can square both sides of this equation to get:\n\n(x + y)^2 = 24^2\nx^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 576\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for x^2 and y^2 from the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n(8^2 + (b - 12)^2) + 2xy + (8^2 + (12)^2) = 576\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n64 + b^2 - 24b + 144 + 2xy + 64 + 144 = 576\nb^2 - 24b + 2xy = 160\n\nNow we need to find the value of b and xy. We can use the fact that the area of the trapezium is given by:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + b) * 8\n\nSince the area can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the two right triangles AED and BEC:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * (b - 12) + (1/2) * 8 * 12\n\nEquating the two expressions for the area, we get:\n\n(1/2) * (12 + b) * 8 = (1/2) * 8 * (b - 12) + (1/2) * 8 * 12\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(12 + b) * 8 = 8 * (b - 12) + 8 * 12\n96 + 8b = 8b - 96 + 96\n8b = 192\nb = 24\n\nNow that we have the value of b, we can find the value of x and y:\n\nx + y = 24\nx = 24 - y\n\nSubstituting this into the Pythagorean theorem for triangle AED:\n\n(24 - y)^2 = 8^2 + (24 - 12)^2\ny^2 - 48y + 576 = 64 + 144\ny^2 - 48y + 576 = 208\ny^2 - 48y + 368 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the value of y:\n\ny = (-(-48) ± √((-48)^2 - 4 * 1 * 368)) / (2 * 1)\ny = (48 ± √(2304 - 1472)) / 2\ny = (48 ± √832) / 2\ny = (48 ± 16√13) / 2\n\nSince y must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n\ny = (48 + 16√13) / 2\ny ≈ 20.35\n\nNow we can find the value of x:\n\nx = 24 - y\nx ≈ 24 - 20.35\nx ≈ 3.65\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = AB + BC + CD + DA\nPerimeter = 12 + 20.35 + 24 + 3.65\nPerimeter ≈ 60\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 60 cm."
