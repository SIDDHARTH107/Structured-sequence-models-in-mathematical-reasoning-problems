    "message_2": "The Koch Island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side of the Koch curve is multiplied by 4/3. \n\nAfter 4 iterations, the length of each side of the Koch curve will be (4/3)^4 times the original length. Since the original line segment has a length of 1 unit, the length of each side of the Koch curve after 4 iterations will be (4/3)^4 = 256/81 units.\n\nSince the Koch Island is an equilateral triangle, it has 3 sides. Therefore, the perimeter of the Koch Island after 4 iterations will be 3 times the length of each side, which is 3 * (256/81) = 768/81 units."
