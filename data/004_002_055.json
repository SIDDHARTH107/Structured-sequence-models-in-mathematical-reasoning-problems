    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (5x^2 - 3x + 2) / (x - 1) as x approaches 3, we can simply substitute the value of x into the function:\n\nf(3) = (5(3)^2 - 3(3) + 2) / (3 - 1)\n\nf(3) = (5(9) - 9 + 2) / (2)\n\nf(3) = (45 - 9 + 2) / (2)\n\nf(3) = (38) / (2)\n\nf(3) = 19\n\nSo, the limit of the function as x approaches 3 is 19."
