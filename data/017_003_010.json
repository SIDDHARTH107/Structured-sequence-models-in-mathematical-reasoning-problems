    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nLet's consider the set S = {g^p : g ∈ G}, where g^p denotes the product of g with itself p times. We will show that S = G.\n\nFirst, we will show that S is a subgroup of G. To do this, we need to show that S is closed under the group operation and that it contains the identity element.\n\n1. Closure: Let g^p and h^p be two elements in S. Then, (g^p)(h^p) = g^p * h^p = (gh)^p (since G is a group, and the operation is associative). Since (gh)^p is an element of S, S is closed under the group operation.\n\n2. Identity: The identity element of G, denoted by e, is in S, because e^p = e.\n\nNow, we know that S is a subgroup of G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since G has p elements and p is prime, the only divisors of p are 1 and p itself. Thus, the order of S must be either 1 or p.\n\nIf the order of S is 1, then S = {e}, which means that g^p = e for all g in G. In this case, let's pick an arbitrary element g in G such that g ≠ e. Since g^p = e, the order of g must divide p. The only divisors of p are 1 and p, but the order of g cannot be 1 (otherwise, g would be the identity element). Therefore, the order of g must be p, which means that G is generated by g and is cyclic.\n\nIf the order of S is p, then S = G. In this case, every element of G can be expressed as a power of some element g in G. Therefore, G is cyclic.\n\nNow, let's find all possible generators of G if G is cyclic. Let g be a generator of G. Then, the order of g is p. By Fermat's Little Theorem, g^p ≡ 1 (mod p) for any element g in G. Since the order of g is p, the smallest positive integer k such that g^k ≡ 1 (mod p) is p. Therefore, g^k ≡ 1 (mod p) if and only if k is a multiple of p.\n\nLet's consider the powers of g: g, g^2, g^3, ..., g^(p-1). By the above observation, none of these powers are congruent to 1 (mod p). Since there are p-1 elements in this list and none of them are congruent to 1 (mod p), they must be congruent to each other in some order. In other words, the powers of g generate a cyclic group of order p.\n\nNow, let h be another generator of G. Then, h must be one of the powers of g, say h = g^k. Since h is a generator, the order of h is p. Therefore, g^(kp) ≡ 1 (mod p), which means that kp is a multiple of p. Since k is an integer, k must be a divisor of p. Since p is prime, the only divisors of p are 1 and p itself. If k = p, then h = g^p = e, which is not a generator. Therefore, k = 1, which means that h = g.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a cyclic group of order p, there is only one generator, up to congruence modulo p."
