    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is equal to 1 mod p and divides n.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Thus, we need to determine the number of Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor 2: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible numbers are 1, 3, and 15. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal, and we get a semi-direct product of the Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups. If there are 3 or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, the group is not a semi-direct product.\n\nFor 3: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible numbers are 1 and 10. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal.\n\nFor 5: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is 1, so there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it is normal.\n\nNow, we can enumerate the non-isomorphic groups of order 120:\n\n1. The direct product of the Sylow subgroups: Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_120.\n2. The semi-direct product of Z_8 × (Z_3 × Z_5) with a non-trivial action of Z_8 on Z_3 × Z_5. There are four such actions, giving four non-isomorphic groups.\n3. The semi-direct product of (Z_8 × Z_3) × Z_5 with a non-trivial action of Z_8 × Z_3 on Z_5. There are two such actions, giving two non-isomorphic groups.\n4. The semi-direct product of Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5 with a non-trivial action of Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5 on itself. There is one such action, giving one non-isomorphic group.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\nHere are examples of each type of group:\n\n1. Z_120: The cyclic group of order 120.\n2. Four semi-direct products of Z_8 × (Z_3 × Z_5): Dihedral group D_40, Dicyclic group Q_40, and two other non-isomorphic groups.\n3. Two semi-direct products of (Z_8 × Z_3) × Z_5: The holomorph of Z_5 and another non-isomorphic group.\n4. One semi-direct product of Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5 with a non-trivial action on itself: The symmetric group S_5."
