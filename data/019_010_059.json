    "message_2": "In linear logic, the symbols have the following meanings:\n\n- $\\&$ represents \"and\" (tensor)\n- $\\oplus$ represents \"or\" (sum)\n- $\\multimap$ represents \"implies\" (linear implication)\n\nGiven $A=1$, $B=0$, and $C=1$, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n$1 \\& (0 \\oplus 1) \\multimap (1 \\& 0) \\oplus (1 \\& 1)$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the $\\oplus$ operation: $0 \\oplus 1 = 1$ (since it's an \"or\" operation, and at least one of the values is true)\n\n2. Substitute the result back into the expression: $1 \\& 1 \\multimap (1 \\& 0) \\oplus (1 \\& 1)$\n\n3. Evaluate the $\\&$ operations: \n   - $1 \\& 1 = 1$ (both values are true)\n   - $1 \\& 0 = 0$ (one value is false)\n   - $1 \\& 1 = 1$ (both values are true)\n\n4. Substitute the results back into the expression: $1 \\multimap (0) \\oplus (1)$\n\n5. Evaluate the $\\oplus$ operation: $0 \\oplus 1 = 1$ (since it's an \"or\" operation, and at least one of the values is true)\n\n6. Substitute the result back into the expression: $1 \\multimap 1$\n\nIn linear logic, $A \\multimap B$ is true if and only if $A$ being true implies that $B$ is also true. In this case, both $A$ and $B$ are true, so the implication holds, and the result of the linear logic formula is true or $1$."
