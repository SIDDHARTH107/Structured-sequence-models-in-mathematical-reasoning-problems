    "message_1": "A factory has reported that, on average, 1 work-related accident occurs every 2 weeks. What is the probability of having exactly 3 work-related accidents in the next 6 weeks?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, work-related accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time (6 weeks) given a known average rate of occurrence (1 accident every 2 weeks).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events in the given time interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average rate of occurrence (in this case, λ = 3, since there are 3 intervals of 2 weeks in 6 weeks, and 1 accident is expected every 2 weeks)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, k = 3 accidents)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-3) * 3^3) / 3!\n\nP(X = 3) = (0.049787 * 27) / 6\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.224041\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 3 work-related accidents in the next 6 weeks is approximately 22.4%."
