    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5 in the range [0, 5], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 and x = 3 are the critical points.\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval [0, 5]:\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 5 = 5\nf(1) = 1^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 5 = -1\nf(3) = 3^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 5 = -1\nf(5) = 5^3 - 6(5)^2 + 9(5) + 5 = 125 - 150 + 45 + 5 = 25\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) in the range [0, 5] is -1, which occurs at x = 1 and x = 3."
