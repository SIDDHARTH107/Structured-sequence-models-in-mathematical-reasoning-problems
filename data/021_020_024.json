    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior of honey bees. It is an iterative algorithm that consists of three main components: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The algorithm starts with an initial population of solutions (food sources) and iteratively updates the solutions until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nHere's a high-level description of the ABC algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Repeat until the stopping criterion is met:\n   a. Employed bees phase: Update the solutions by generating new neighbor solutions and evaluate their fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the old one.\n   b. Onlooker bees phase: Select solutions based on their fitness (probability) and update them similarly to the employed bees phase.\n   c. Scout bees phase: If a solution cannot be improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n4. Return the best solution found.\n\nNow, let's apply the ABC algorithm to the given optimization problem:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (x, y) within the search space [-4, 4] for both x and y, and considering the constraint x^2 + y^2 ≥ 4.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the objective function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 4y + 4.\n3. Repeat until the stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum fitness improvement threshold):\n   a. Employed bees phase: Generate new solutions (x', y') by modifying the current solutions (x, y) and evaluate their fitness. If f(x', y') < f(x, y), replace (x, y) with (x', y').\n   b. Onlooker bees phase: Select solutions based on their fitness and update them similarly to the employed bees phase.\n   c. Scout bees phase: If a solution cannot be improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new solution within the search space and considering the constraint.\n4. Return the best solution found (x*, y*) and the minimum value of f(x*, y*).\n\nPlease note that the ABC algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, and the solution found may not be the global minimum. However, by running the algorithm multiple times or adjusting its parameters, you can increase the chances of finding a better solution."
