The manufacturing process for each widget requires a certain amount of labor and raw materials, as shown in the table below:\n\n|      | Labor (hours) | Raw materials (kg) |\n|------|--------------|--------------------|\n| Widget A | 2            | 1                  |\n| Widget B | 1            | 2                  |\n\nA maximum of 40 hours of labor and 30 kg of raw materials are available each week. Widget A sells for $10 each and Widget B sells for $7 each. \n\nThe objective is to find the optimal production quantities of both widgets that will maximize the total revenue earned by the company. \n\nWhat are the optimal production quantities of Widgets A and B that will maximize the company's revenue and what is the maximum revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Widget A produced and y be the number of Widget B produced.\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw materials can be represented as:\n\n2x + y ≤ 40 (Labor constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 30 (Raw materials constraint)\n\nSince the company cannot produce a negative number of widgets, we also have:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total revenue is:\n\nRevenue = 10x + 7y\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we will first graph the constraints and find the feasible region.\n\nThe constraints can be rewritten as:\n\ny ≤ 40 - 2x (Labor constraint)\ny ≤ (30 - x) / 2 (Raw materials constraint)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 15), (20, 0), and (10, 10). We will evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. (0, 0): Revenue = 10(0) + 7(0) = $0\n2. (0, 15): Revenue = 10(0) + 7(15) = $105\n3. (20, 0): Revenue = 10(20) + 7(0) = $200\n4. (10, 10): Revenue = 10(10) + 7(10) = $170\n\nThe maximum revenue of $200 is achieved when the company produces 20 units of Widget A and 0 units of Widget B."
