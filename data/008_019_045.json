    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n4x + 6yi = 8 + 10i\n\nNow we have:\n\n(1) 4x + 6yi = 8 + 10i\n(2) 4x - yi = 6 + 7i\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (2): (4x + 6yi) - (4x - yi) = (8 + 10i) - (6 + 7i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n7yi = 2 + 3i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7i:\n\ny = (2 + 3i) / 7i\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary unit in the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is -7i:\n\ny = ((2 + 3i) * (-7i)) / (7i * (-7i))\n\ny = (-14i - 21i^2) / 49i^2\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we have:\n\ny = (-14i + 21) / -49\n\ny = (21 - 14i) / 49\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of x. We'll use equation (1):\n\n4x + 6yi = 8 + 10i\n\n4x + 6(21 - 14i)i = 8 + 10i\n\n4x + 126i - 84i^2 = 8 + 10i\n\n4x + 126i + 84 = 8 + 10i\n\nNow, subtract 84 from both sides and subtract 126i from both sides:\n\n4x = -76 + 136i\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = (-76 + 136i) / 4\n\nx = -19 + 34i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = -19 + 34i\ny = (21 - 14i) / 49"
