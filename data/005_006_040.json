    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 170 cm, the population standard deviation (σ) is 10 cm, and the sample size (n) is 100.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σ_sample):\n\nσ_sample = σ / √n\nσ_sample = 10 / √100\nσ_sample = 10 / 10\nσ_sample = 1 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 173 cm:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample\nz = (173 - 170) / 1\nz = 3\n\nNow, we will use a z-table or calculator to find the probability that the average height is greater than 173 cm, which corresponds to the area to the right of the z-score of 3. \n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of z = 3 is approximately 0.9987. Since we want the area to the right, we subtract this value from 1:\n\nArea to the right of z = 3 = 1 - 0.9987 = 0.0013\n\nSo, the probability that the average height of a random sample of 100 people is greater than 173 cm is approximately 0.0013 or 0.13%."
