    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted an encrypted message that was encoded using the Playfair cipher. The message consists of 50 pairs of letters. Using frequency analysis and knowledge of common English letter combinations, you were able to determine 20 of the pairs with reasonable confidence. What is the number of possible plaintext messages that could correspond to the remaining 30 pairs of letters in the ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "In the Playfair cipher, each pair of letters in the plaintext is encrypted as a different pair of letters in the ciphertext. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and the Playfair cipher treats 'I' and 'J' as the same letter, there are 25 distinct letters. Each pair of letters can be any of the 25 letters, so there are 25 * 25 = 625 possible pairs of letters.\n\nYou have determined 20 of the 50 pairs with reasonable confidence, leaving 30 pairs undetermined. For each of these 30 pairs, there are 625 possible plaintext pairs. Therefore, the number of possible plaintext messages that could correspond to the remaining 30 pairs of letters in the ciphertext is 625^30, which is approximately 4.61 * 10^104."
