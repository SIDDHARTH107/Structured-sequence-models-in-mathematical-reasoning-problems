    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces light bulbs with a mean lifespan of 1000 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. If a sample of 25 light bulbs is tested, what is the probability that the sample mean lifespan is less than 980 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 1000 hours, the population standard deviation (σ) is 100 hours, and the sample size (n) is 25.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean), which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nσ_sample_mean = 100 / √25\nσ_sample_mean = 100 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 20 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for a sample mean of 980 hours. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nz = (980 - 1000) / 20\nz = (-20) / 20\nz = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 980 hours, which is the same as finding the probability that the z-score is less than -1. We can look up the probability in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator or software to find the probability.\n\nP(z < -1) ≈ 0.1587\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean lifespan is less than 980 hours is approximately 15.87%."
