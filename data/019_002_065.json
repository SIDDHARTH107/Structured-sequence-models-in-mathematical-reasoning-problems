    "message_2": "Using predicate logic, we can write the statement as follows:\n\n∀x (E(x) → E(x²))\n\nHere, ∀x represents \"for all values of x\", E(x) represents \"x is an even integer\", and E(x²) represents \"x squared is an even integer\". The arrow (→) represents the implication \"if... then...\".\n\nNow, let's determine if the statement is true or false when x = 8.\n\nSince 8 is an even integer, E(8) is true. Now, let's find the square of 8:\n\n8² = 64\n\nSince 64 is also an even integer, E(64) or E(8²) is true.\n\nAccording to the given statement, if E(x) is true, then E(x²) should also be true. In this case, both E(8) and E(8²) are true, so the statement holds true when x = 8."
