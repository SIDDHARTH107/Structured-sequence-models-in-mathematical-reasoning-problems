    "message_1": "A shipping company has to deliver 12 packages to 8 different locations. Each package can be delivered by any of the available trucks. However, each truck can deliver only one package to a location and can't deliver more than one package. Find the minimum number of trucks needed to complete the delivery.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of trucks needed, we can divide the total number of packages (12) by the maximum number of packages a single truck can deliver (1). Since each truck can only deliver one package to a location, we need at least as many trucks as there are packages.\n\nSo, the minimum number of trucks needed is 12."
