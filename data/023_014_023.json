    "message_2": "To find the momentum of the particle using Fourier analysis, we first need to normalize the wave function Ψ(x). The normalization condition is:\n\n∫ |Ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1\n\nFor our given wave function, this becomes:\n\n∫ (A sin(πx/4))^2 dx = 1, where the integral is taken from 0 to 4 meters.\n\nA^2 ∫ (sin(πx/4))^2 dx = 1\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use the identity:\n\n(sin(θ))^2 = (1 - cos(2θ))/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nA^2 ∫ (1 - cos(πx/2))/2 dx = 1, from 0 to 4 meters.\n\nA^2 [∫ (1/2) dx - ∫ (cos(πx/2))/2 dx] = 1\n\nA^2 [(1/2)x - (1/π)sin(πx/2)] from 0 to 4 = 1\n\nA^2 [(1/2)(4) - (1/π)(0)] = 1\n\nA^2 (2) = 1\n\nA = 1/√2\n\nNow that we have the normalized wave function Ψ(x) = (1/√2) sin(πx/4), we can find the momentum using Fourier analysis. The momentum operator is given by:\n\nP = -iħ(∂/∂x)\n\nWhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 kg m^2/s).\n\nWe can find the expectation value of the momentum by calculating:\n\n<Ψ|P|Ψ> = ∫ Ψ*(x) P Ψ(x) dx\n\nFor our wave function, this becomes:\n\n∫ [(1/√2) sin(πx/4)]*(-iħ(∂/∂x))[(1/√2) sin(πx/4)] dx, from 0 to 4 meters.\n\nThe derivative of the wave function with respect to x is:\n\n(∂/∂x) [(1/√2) sin(πx/4)] = (π/4√2) cos(πx/4)\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the expectation value integral:\n\n∫ [(1/√2) sin(πx/4)]*(-iħ)(π/4√2) cos(πx/4) dx, from 0 to 4 meters.\n\nHowever, since sin(θ) and cos(θ) are orthogonal functions, their product integrated over a complete period is zero. Therefore, the expectation value of the momentum is:\n\n<Ψ|P|Ψ> = 0\n\nSo, the momentum of the particle in the potential well is 0 kg m/s."
