    "message_1": "A system is described by the following differential equation:\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 2\\frac{dy}{dt} + 5y = 2\\cos(3t)$$\nUsing Fourier transform, determine whether the system is stable or unstable.",
    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system, we first need to analyze the homogeneous part of the given differential equation, which is:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 2\\frac{dy}{dt} + 5y = 0$$\n\nThis is a linear second-order differential equation with constant coefficients. To solve it, we assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$y(t) = e^{rt}$$\n\nwhere r is a constant. Substituting this into the homogeneous equation, we get:\n\n$$r^2 e^{rt} + 2r e^{rt} + 5 e^{rt} = 0$$\n\nDividing by $e^{rt}$, we obtain the characteristic equation:\n\n$$r^2 + 2r + 5 = 0$$\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this equation. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is:\n\n$$\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4(1)(5) = 4 - 20 = -16$$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\n$$r_1 = \\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{-16}}{2} = -1 + 2i$$\n$$r_2 = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{-16}}{2} = -1 - 2i$$\n\nThe general solution of the homogeneous equation is:\n\n$$y_h(t) = C_1 e^{(-1 + 2i)t} + C_2 e^{(-1 - 2i)t}$$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants.\n\nNow, let's analyze the stability of the system. A system is stable if all the roots of the characteristic equation have negative real parts. In this case, both roots have a real part of -1, which is negative. Therefore, the system is stable."
