    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher message, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair square using the key \"MATHS\". \n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters from left to right, top to bottom.\n2. Fill in the remaining spaces in the 5x5 square with the rest of the alphabet (excluding J, since I and J are combined in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe resulting Playfair square is:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message \"OJQUPSGPJZR\" using the following rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to the left (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nDecrypting the message:\n\nOJ -> LI\nQU -> KE\nPS -> ME\nGP -> ET\nJZ -> IN\nR -> G\n\nThe decrypted message is \"LIKE MEETING\"."
