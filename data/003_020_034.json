    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on the ground. The angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole from a point on the ground is 45°. From another point that is 20 meters closer to the flagpole, the angle of elevation is 60°. Determine the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the flagpole as h, the distance from the first point to the flagpole as x, and the distance from the second point to the flagpole as (x-20). We can use the tangent function to set up two equations based on the angle of elevation and the height of the flagpole.\n\nFrom the first point:\ntan(45°) = h/x\n1 = h/x (since tan(45°) = 1)\nh = x\n\nFrom the second point:\ntan(60°) = h/(x-20)\n√3 = h/(x-20) (since tan(60°) = √3)\n\nNow we can substitute h from the first equation into the second equation:\n√3 = x/(x-20)\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x-20):\n√3(x-20) = x\n\nNow distribute √3:\n√3x - 20√3 = x\n\nMove x to the left side of the equation:\n√3x - x = 20√3\n\nFactor out x:\nx(√3 - 1) = 20√3\n\nNow divide by (√3 - 1):\nx = 20√3 / (√3 - 1)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate (√3 + 1):\nx = (20√3(√3 + 1)) / (3 - 1)\nx = (20√3 + 20(3)) / 2\nx = (20√3 + 60) / 2\n\nNow divide by 2:\nx = 10√3 + 30\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the height of the flagpole using the equation h = x:\nh = 10√3 + 30\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is (10√3 + 30) meters."
