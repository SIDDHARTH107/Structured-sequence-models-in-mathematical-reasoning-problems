    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products, A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and the profit per unit of product B is $12. The company has 200 units of labour available per day and a maximum of 300 units of raw material available per day. Each unit of product A requires 4 units of labour and 6 units of raw material, and each unit of product B requires 5 units of labour and 3 units of raw material. How many units of each product should the company produce per day to maximize its profit? What is the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced per day. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 12y.\n\nThe constraints are given by the availability of labour and raw material:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 200 (labour constraint)\n6x + 3y ≤ 300 (raw material constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the feasible region and finding the vertices.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the inequalities as equalities to find the boundary lines:\n\n4x + 5y = 200\n6x + 3y = 300\n\nNow, we can find the points where these lines intersect the axes:\n\nFor 4x + 5y = 200:\nx = 0 => y = 40\ny = 0 => x = 50\n\nFor 6x + 3y = 300:\nx = 0 => y = 100\ny = 0 => x = 50\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 40), (50, 0), and the intersection point of the two lines:\n\n4x + 5y = 200\n6x + 3y = 300\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = 20, y = 20\n\nSo, the feasible region has vertices at (0, 0), (0, 40), (50, 0), and (20, 20).\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\nP(0, 40) = 10(0) + 12(40) = $480\nP(50, 0) = 10(50) + 12(0) = $500\nP(20, 20) = 10(20) + 12(20) = $440\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (50, 0), with a profit of $500 per day. Therefore, the company should produce 50 units of product A and 0 units of product B per day to maximize its profit."
