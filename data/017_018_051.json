We will show that every group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of these non-abelian groups.\n\nFirst, note that a group of order 32 must have a prime power order, specifically 32 = 2^5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 32 must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which means that this subgroup is normal.\n\nLet G be a group of order 32, and let P be its unique Sylow 2-subgroup. Since P is normal in G, we have that G is a semi-direct product of P by some group of order 1 (which is just the trivial group). This means that G is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of the form C2^5 ⋊ H, where H is a group of order 1.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of H. Since H has order 1, it must be the trivial group. This means that G is isomorphic to the direct product C2^5 × H, which is just C2^5. This is the cyclic group of order 32, denoted C32.\n\nNext, we consider the dihedral group D16. This group has order 32 and is non-abelian. It is generated by two elements, a rotation r and a reflection s, with the relations r^16 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^(-1)s. This group is not isomorphic to C32, as it is non-abelian.\n\nFinally, we consider the non-abelian groups of order 32. There are 49 such groups, and they can be classified using the theory of p-groups and their automorphism groups. These groups are not isomorphic to C32 or D16, as they are non-abelian and have different presentations.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32, and every group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the 49 non-abelian groups."
