    "message_1": "A company wants to test the effectiveness of two different cleaning agents for removing grease stains. They randomly selected 15 grease-stained shirts and divided them into two groups of 8 and 7. The first group was cleaned with cleaning agent A and the second group was cleaned with cleaning agent B. The time (in seconds) it took to completely remove the grease stain was recorded for each shirt. Use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at a significance level of 0.05 to determine if there is a significant difference in the cleaning effectiveness of the two agents. \n\nCalculate the test statistic and p-value for this problem.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the data from both groups and rank them in ascending order.\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group.\n3. Calculate the test statistic (W) and the expected value (E) and variance (Var) of the test statistic.\n4. Calculate the z-score and the corresponding p-value.\n5. Compare the p-value to the significance level (0.05) to determine if there is a significant difference in the cleaning effectiveness of the two agents.\n\nLet's assume the recorded times for cleaning agent A are A1, A2, ..., A8, and for cleaning agent B are B1, B2, ..., B7. Please provide the recorded times for both cleaning agents to proceed with the calculations."
