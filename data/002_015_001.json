    "message_1": "A circular platform has a diameter of 14 meters. What is the perimeter of the platform in meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. Since the diameter of the platform is 14 meters, the radius is half of that, which is 7 meters.\n\nC = 2πr\nC = 2 * π * 7\nC ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 7\nC ≈ 43.98226\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the platform is approximately 43.98 meters."
