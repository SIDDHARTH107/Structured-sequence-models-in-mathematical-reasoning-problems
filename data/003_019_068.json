    "message_2": "To find the integral of sin(x) from x = 0 to x = π/2, we first need to find the antiderivative of sin(x) with respect to x. The antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. \n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n\n∫(sin(x) dx) from 0 to π/2 = [-cos(x)] from 0 to π/2\n\n= -cos(π/2) - (-cos(0))\n\n= -0 - (-1)\n\n= 1\n\nSo, the integral of sin(x) from x = 0 to x = π/2 is 1."
