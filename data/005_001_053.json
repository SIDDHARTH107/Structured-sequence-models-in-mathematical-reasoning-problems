    "message_1": "Suppose a candy company claims that their bags of candies contain an average of 50 pieces per bag. A student randomly selects 36 bags of candies and finds that the average number of pieces per bag is 48 with a standard deviation of 5. Can the student reject the company's claim at a 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the student can reject the company's claim at a 5% significance level, we will perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The average number of candies per bag is 50.\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The average number of candies per bag is not 50.\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 36\nSample mean (x̄) = 48\nPopulation mean (μ) = 50\nSample standard deviation (s) = 5\n\nSince the sample size is greater than 30, we can use the z-test. However, we don't have the population standard deviation, so we will use the t-test instead.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (48 - 50) / (5 / √36)\nt = -2 / (5 / 6)\nt = -2 / (5/6)\nt = -2 * (6/5)\nt = -12/5\nt = -2.4\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level with 36 - 1 = 35 degrees of freedom. We can use a t-table or an online calculator to find this value. The critical t-values are approximately -2.030 and 2.030.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-2.4) is less than the critical t-value (-2.030), we can reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level. This means that the student has enough evidence to reject the company's claim that their bags of candies contain an average of 50 pieces per bag."
