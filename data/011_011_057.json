    "message_1": "A student wants to divide 12 identical balls into 3 distinct groups, with each group having at least 2 balls. In how many ways can the balls be divided?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. Since each group must have at least 2 balls, we can start by placing 2 balls in each group. Now we have 6 balls left to distribute among the 3 groups.\n\nWe can represent the 6 balls as stars (*) and use 2 bars (|) to separate them into 3 groups. For example, the arrangement **|***|* would represent 4 balls in the first group, 5 balls in the second group, and 3 balls in the third group (remember that we already placed 2 balls in each group initially).\n\nSo, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 6 stars and 2 bars. There are a total of 8 positions (6 stars + 2 bars), and we need to choose 2 of them for the bars. This can be done in C(8,2) ways, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(8,2) = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = 28\n\nSo there are 28 ways to divide the 12 identical balls into 3 distinct groups, with each group having at least 2 balls."
