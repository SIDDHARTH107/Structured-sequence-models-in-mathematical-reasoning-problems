    "message_2": "To find all solutions in the interval [0, 2π) to the equation 2sin(2x) = √2, we first isolate sin(2x):\n\nsin(2x) = (√2) / 2\n\nNow, we know that sin(π/4) = (√2) / 2 and sin(5π/4) = (√2) / 2. Since the sine function has a period of 2π, we can find all solutions for sin(2x) by adding integer multiples of 2π to both π/4 and 5π/4:\n\nsin(2x) = sin(π/4 + 2nπ) and sin(2x) = sin(5π/4 + 2nπ), where n is an integer.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that satisfy these equations. To do this, we divide both sides of the equations by 2:\n\nx = (π/4 + 2nπ) / 2 and x = (5π/4 + 2nπ) / 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = π/8 + nπ and x = 5π/8 + nπ\n\nNow, we need to find all the values of x in the interval [0, 2π) that satisfy these equations. We can do this by plugging in different integer values for n:\n\nFor x = π/8 + nπ:\n\nn = 0: x = π/8\nn = 1: x = 9π/8\n\nFor x = 5π/8 + nπ:\n\nn = 0: x = 5π/8\nn = 1: x = 13π/8\n\nAll of these values are within the interval [0, 2π). Therefore, the solutions to the equation 2sin(2x) = √2 in the interval [0, 2π) are:\n\nx = π/8, 5π/8, 9π/8, and 13π/8."
