Consider two closed curves $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in $X$ that intersect transversely at exactly two points. Show that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homotopic if and only if the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is equal to $0$.",
    "message_2": "We will first show that if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homotopic, then their intersection number is $0$.\n\nSuppose $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homotopic. Then there exists a continuous map $H: X \\times [0,1] \\to X$ such that $H(x,0) = \\alpha(x)$ and $H(x,1) = \\beta(x)$ for all $x \\in X$. Since $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ intersect transversely at exactly two points, we can choose a small neighborhood $U$ around one of the intersection points such that $U$ does not contain the other intersection point, and the restriction of $H$ to $U \\times [0,1]$ is a homotopy between the intersection points of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in $U$. By the homotopy invariance of intersection numbers, the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in $U$ is equal to the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in $X$. Since $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ intersect transversely at exactly two points, their intersection number in $X$ is $\\pm 2$. However, since they are homotopic, their intersection number must be $0$. This is a contradiction, so the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ must be $0$.\n\nNow we will show that if the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is $0$, then $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homotopic.\n\nSince $X$ is a compact, connected, oriented, topological 2-manifold without boundary, it is either a sphere or a connected sum of tori. We will consider these two cases separately.\n\nCase 1: $X$ is a sphere.\n\nIn this case, every closed curve on $X$ is null-homotopic, i.e., homotopic to a constant map. Since both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are closed curves on $X$, they are both null-homotopic. Therefore, they are homotopic to each other.\n\nCase 2: $X$ is a connected sum of tori.\n\nLet $X = T_1 \\# \\cdots \\# T_n$ be the connected sum decomposition of $X$ into tori. We can represent each torus $T_i$ as a square with opposite sides identified, and we can represent the connected sum decomposition as a collection of squares with some vertices identified. We can represent $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as closed curves in this collection of squares.\n\nSince the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is $0$, we can find a chain of squares $S_1, \\dots, S_m$ such that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ intersect transversely at exactly one point in each square $S_i$, and the intersection points have alternating signs. We can then find a homotopy between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ by \"sliding\" $\\alpha$ along the chain of squares, changing its intersection points with $\\beta$ one by one, until it coincides with $\\beta$. This homotopy is well-defined since the intersection points have alternating signs, and it shows that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homotopic.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that if the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is $0$, then $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are homotopic. This completes the proof."
