    "message_1": "A triangle has angles of 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees. The length of the side opposite to the 60 degree angle is 5 units. Find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the law of sines.",
    "message_2": "Using the law of sines, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(sin(angle) / side length) = (sin(angle) / side length)\n\nLet's label the sides of the triangle as follows:\n- Side a is opposite the 30-degree angle\n- Side b is opposite the 60-degree angle (5 units)\n- Side c is opposite the 90-degree angle (the hypotenuse)\n\nNow, we can set up the equation using the law of sines:\n\n(sin(60°) / 5) = (sin(90°) / c)\n\nWe know that sin(60°) = √3/2 and sin(90°) = 1. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n(√3/2 / 5) = (1 / c)\n\nNow, we can solve for c:\n\nc = 5 / (√3/2)\n\nTo get rid of the fraction in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\nc = (5 * 2) / √3\n\nc = 10 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\nc = (10 * √3) / (√3 * √3)\n\nc = 10√3 / 3\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse (side c) is 10√3/3 units."
