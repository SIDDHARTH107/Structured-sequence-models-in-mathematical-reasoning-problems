    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext for \"MATH\" using the given Caesar cipher, we need to shift each letter by the same amount as shown in the given examples. From the given examples, we can see that the shift is +2 (A → C, B → D, etc.).\n\nNow, let's apply this shift to each letter in \"MATH\":\n\nM → O (shifted 2 positions forward)\nA → C (shifted 2 positions forward)\nT → V (shifted 2 positions forward)\nH → J (shifted 2 positions forward)\n\nSo, the ciphertext for \"MATH\" is \"OCVJ\"."
