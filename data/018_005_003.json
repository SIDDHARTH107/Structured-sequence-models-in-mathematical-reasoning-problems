    "message_2": "To show that the intersection of set A and its complement is the empty set, we first need to find the complement of set A with respect to the universal set U.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nBy comparing the elements in set A and set U, we can find the elements that are in U but not in A:\n\nA' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement A', denoted as A ∩ A'.\n\nThe intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, we are looking for elements that are in both set A and set A'.\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nComparing the elements in set A and set A', we can see that there are no common elements between the two sets:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set."
