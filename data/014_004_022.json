    "message_2": "To find the public key Q = kP for the private key k = 7, we need to perform elliptic curve point multiplication. This means we need to add the point P to itself k times. In this case, we will add P to itself 7 times.\n\nElliptic curve point addition involves finding the slope of the line between two points and using that slope to find the third point of intersection with the curve. The slope formula for point addition is:\n\nλ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nHowever, when adding a point to itself (point doubling), we use the following formula for the slope:\n\nλ = (3x^2 + a) / 2y\n\nGiven the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the field F_p, with p = 17, and the base point P = (5,1), we can calculate the public key Q = 7P as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the slope λ for point doubling P:\nλ = (3 * (5^2) + 2) / (2 * 1) = (75 + 2) / 2 = 77 / 2 ≡ 8 / 2 (mod 17) = 4\n\n2. Calculate the x-coordinate of 2P:\nx_2P = λ^2 - x1 - x2 = 4^2 - 5 - 5 = 16 - 10 = 6 (mod 17)\n\n3. Calculate the y-coordinate of 2P:\ny_2P = λ(x1 - x_2P) - y1 = 4(5 - 6) - 1 = -4 - 1 = -5 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n\nNow we have 2P = (6, 12).\n\n4. Calculate the slope λ for adding P and 2P:\nλ = (12 - 1) / (6 - 5) = 11 / 1 = 11 (mod 17)\n\n5. Calculate the x-coordinate of 3P:\nx_3P = λ^2 - x1 - x_2P = 11^2 - 5 - 6 = 121 - 11 = 110 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n\n6. Calculate the y-coordinate of 3P:\ny_3P = λ(x1 - x_3P) - y1 = 11(5 - 15) - 1 = -110 - 1 = -111 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n\nNow we have 3P = (15, 6).\n\nWe need to calculate 7P, so we need to add 3P and 4P. Since 4P = 2(2P), we can double 2P to get 4P.\n\n7. Calculate the slope λ for point doubling 2P:\nλ = (3 * (6^2) + 2) / (2 * 12) = (108 + 2) / 24 = 110 / 24 ≡ 7 / 7 (mod 17) = 1\n\n8. Calculate the x-coordinate of 4P:\nx_4P = λ^2 - x_2P - x_2P = 1^2 - 6 - 6 = 1 - 12 = -11 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n\n9. Calculate the y-coordinate of 4P:\ny_4P = λ(x_2P - x_4P) - y_2P = 1(6 - 6) - 12 = 0 - 12 = -12 ≡ 5 (mod 17)\n\nNow we have 4P = (6, 5).\n\nFinally, we need to add 3P and 4P to get 7P.\n\n10. Calculate the slope λ for adding 3P and 4P:\nλ = (5 - 6) / (6 - 15) = -1 / -9 = 1 / 9 ≡ 1 * 2 (mod 17) = 2\n\n11. Calculate the x-coordinate of 7P:\nx_7P = λ^2 - x_3P - x_4P = 2^2 - 15 - 6 = 4 - 21 = -17 ≡ 0 (mod 17)\n\n12. Calculate the y-coordinate of 7P:\ny_7P = λ(x_3P - x_7P) - y_3P = 2(15 - 0) - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n\nNow we have 7P = (0, 7).\n\nSo, the public key Q = kP for the private key k = 7 is Q = (0, 7)."
