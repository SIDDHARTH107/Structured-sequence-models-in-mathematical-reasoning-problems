    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a theft occurring in the next week, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, thefts) occurring in a fixed interval of time (one week).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k thefts occurring in the next week\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average number of thefts per week\n- k is the number of thefts we want to find the probability for\n\nFirst, we need to convert the average number of thefts per month to the average number of thefts per week. Since there are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month, we can calculate λ as follows:\n\nλ = (3 thefts per month) / (4.33 weeks per month) ≈ 0.692 thefts per week\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one theft occurring in the next week. To do this, we can find the probability of no thefts occurring and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.692) * 0.692^0) / 0! ≈ 0.500\n\nP(at least 1 theft) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.500 = 0.500\n\nSo, the probability of a theft occurring in the particular neighborhood in the next week is approximately 0.500 or 50%."
