    "message_1": "A guitar string is plucked and vibrates with a displacement function given by y(x,t) = 0.01 sin(1000πt)sin(20πx) where x is measured in meters and t is measured in seconds. Determine the speed of propagation of the wave on the string.",
    "message_2": "The given displacement function is y(x, t) = 0.01 sin(1000πt) sin(20πx). This function is in the form of a sinusoidal wave equation, which can be written as:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(ωt - kx) or y(x, t) = A sin(ωt + kx)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, k is the wave number, and x and t are the position and time variables, respectively.\n\nComparing the given function with the general wave equation, we can identify the following:\n\nω = 1000π (rad/s)\nk = 20π (rad/m)\n\nThe speed of propagation (v) of the wave can be found using the relationship between angular frequency (ω), wave number (k), and speed (v):\n\nv = ω / k\n\nSubstituting the values of ω and k, we get:\n\nv = (1000π) / (20π)\n\nv = 50 m/s\n\nSo, the speed of propagation of the wave on the string is 50 meters per second."
