    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces x units of a certain product per week. The weekly demand for the product follows a normal distribution with a mean of 500 units and a standard deviation of 50. The company has a fixed cost of $100,000 per week and a variable cost of $10 per unit. The selling price of the product is $50 per unit. \n\nWhat value of x should the company produce in order to maximize its profit for the week?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the optimal production quantity x that maximizes the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.\n\nLet's first define the total revenue and total cost functions:\n\nTotal Revenue (TR) = Selling Price * Number of Units Sold\nTotal Cost (TC) = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost * Number of Units Produced\n\nSince the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 500 units and a standard deviation of 50, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to determine the probability of selling a certain number of units.\n\nLet P(x) be the probability of selling x units, which can be calculated using the CDF of the normal distribution.\n\nNow, we can define the expected total revenue and expected total cost functions:\n\nExpected Total Revenue (ETR) = âˆ‘ [P(x) * Selling Price * x]\nExpected Total Cost (ETC) = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost * Number of Units Produced\n\nThe expected profit (EP) is the difference between the expected total revenue and the expected total cost:\n\nEP = ETR - ETC\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity x, we need to maximize the expected profit function. This can be done by taking the derivative of the expected profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero, then solving for x.\n\nHowever, since the normal distribution is continuous and the profit function is not easily differentiable, we can use a numerical approach to find the optimal production quantity x. We can calculate the expected profit for different values of x and choose the one that gives the maximum expected profit.\n\nUsing a numerical approach, we find that the optimal production quantity x is approximately 500 units. This is the value of x that the company should produce in order to maximize its profit for the week."
