    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 inches, a width of 6 inches, and a height of 4 inches. Find the total surface area of the prism.",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them all together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one of the length-width faces is 8 inches * 6 inches = 48 square inches. Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 48 * 2 = 96 square inches.\n\n2. The area of one of the length-height faces is 8 inches * 4 inches = 32 square inches. Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 32 * 2 = 64 square inches.\n\n3. The area of one of the width-height faces is 6 inches * 4 inches = 24 square inches. Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 24 * 2 = 48 square inches.\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together: 96 + 64 + 48 = 208 square inches.\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 square inches."
