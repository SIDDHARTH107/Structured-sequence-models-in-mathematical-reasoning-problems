    "message_2": "To find the maximum independent set in a graph G with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we first need to understand the structure of the graph. Since G has 9 edges, it is likely to have some triangles (i.e., cycles of length 3) in it.\n\nRecall that an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. The maximum independent set is the largest such set.\n\nLet's use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our case, with 6 vertices and 9 edges, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 9 = 18.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum degree of a vertex in G. If the maximum degree is 5, then there is a vertex connected to all other vertices, and the maximum independent set would be the remaining 5 vertices. However, this would mean that the sum of the degrees is at least 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25, which is greater than 18. This is a contradiction, so the maximum degree must be less than 5.\n\nIf the maximum degree is 4, then there is a vertex connected to 4 other vertices. The remaining vertex is connected to at least 2 of these 4 vertices (otherwise, we would have a maximum degree less than 4). This means that the maximum independent set can have at most 2 vertices (the vertex with degree 4 and the remaining vertex).\n\nTherefore, the maximum independent set in G has at most 2 vertices."
