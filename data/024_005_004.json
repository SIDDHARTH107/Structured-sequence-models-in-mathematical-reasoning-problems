    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and the corresponding principal normal vectors, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the first and second fundamental forms.\n2. Compute the Gaussian curvature (K) and the mean curvature (H).\n3. Find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) using the quadratic formula.\n4. Find the principal normal vectors by solving the eigenvector problem.\n\nStep 1: First and second fundamental forms\n\nThe given surface is z = x^2 + y^2. We can rewrite it as a parametric form:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the first derivatives with respect to u and v:\n\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by:\n\nI = (ru•ru, ru•rv)\n    (rv•ru, rv•rv)\n\nI = (1 + 4u^2, 2uv)\n    (2uv, 1 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives:\n\nruu = d^2r/du^2 = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = d^2r/dudv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = d^2r/dv^2 = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by:\n\nII = (ruu•N, ruv•N)\n     (ruv•N, rvv•N)\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector. To find N, we first find the normal vector:\n\nN = ru × rv = (2u, 2v, -1)\n\nNow, we normalize N:\n\n|N| = sqrt((2u)^2 + (2v)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nN = (2u/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), 2v/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), -1/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form:\n\nII = (2, 0)\n     (0, 2)\n\nStep 2: Gaussian curvature (K) and mean curvature (H)\n\nThe Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H are given by:\n\nK = det(II)/det(I)\nH = 1/2 * trace(II * I^(-1))\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. So, the first and second fundamental forms become:\n\nI = (5, 2)\n    (2, 5)\n\nII = (2, 0)\n     (0, 2)\n\nNow, we can find K and H:\n\nK = det(II)/det(I) = (2*2)/(5*5 - 2*2) = 4/21\n\nH = 1/2 * trace(II * I^(-1)) = 1/2 * (2/5 + 2/5) = 2/5\n\nStep 3: Principal curvatures (k1 and k2)\n\nThe principal curvatures k1 and k2 can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\nk1, k2 = H ± sqrt(H^2 - K)\n\nk1 = 2/5 + sqrt((2/5)^2 - 4/21) = 2/5 + sqrt(1/25 - 4/21)\nk2 = 2/5 - sqrt((2/5)^2 - 4/21) = 2/5 - sqrt(1/25 - 4/21)\n\nk1 ≈ 0.821\nk2 ≈ 0.179\n\nStep 4: Principal normal vectors\n\nTo find the principal normal vectors, we need to solve the eigenvector problem:\n\n(I - k * II) * X = 0\n\nFor k1:\n\n(I - k1 * II) * X = (5 - 2k1, 2)\n                    (2, 5 - 2k1) * X = 0\n\nFor k2:\n\n(I - k2 * II) * X = (5 - 2k2, 2)\n                    (2, 5 - 2k2) * X = 0\n\nSolving these eigenvector problems, we get the principal normal vectors:\n\nFor k1: X1 ≈ (0.894, -0.447)\nFor k2: X2 ≈ (0.447, 0.894)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,2) are k1 ≈ 0.821 and k2 ≈ 0.179, and the corresponding principal normal vectors are X1 ≈ (0.894, -0.447) and X2 ≈ (0.447, 0.894)."
