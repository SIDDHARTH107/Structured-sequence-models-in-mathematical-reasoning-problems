    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x - 4 > 14, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 4 to both sides of the inequality.\n3x - 4 + 4 > 14 + 4\n3x > 18\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 3.\n3x/3 > 18/3\nx > 6\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x > 6.\n\nTo graph the solution on the number line, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Draw a number line and label it with numbers. Make sure to include the number 6.\n\nStep 2: Since x > 6, place an open circle at 6 on the number line. An open circle indicates that the value 6 is not included in the solution.\n\nStep 3: Shade the region to the right of the open circle at 6. This represents all the values greater than 6.\n\nThe graph of the solution on the number line will have an open circle at 6 and the region to the right of the circle shaded."
