Prove that the sum of the Betti numbers of X is less than or equal to k. \n\nFor example, if X is a 2-dimensional torus (i.e., a donut shape), and f is a nondegenerate Morse function with exactly four critical points, what is the maximum possible value of the total Betti numbers of X?",
    "message_2": "We will use the Morse inequalities to prove that the sum of the Betti numbers of X is less than or equal to k. The Morse inequalities state that for any Morse function f on a manifold X, the following inequalities hold:\n\nb_i(X) ≤ c_i(X, f),\n\nwhere b_i(X) is the i-th Betti number of X, and c_i(X, f) is the number of critical points of index i of the Morse function f. The index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of f at that point.\n\nNow, let's sum up the inequalities for all i from 0 to n:\n\nΣ b_i(X) ≤ Σ c_i(X, f),\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all i from 0 to n. Since X has k critical points, the sum of the critical points of all indices is equal to k:\n\nΣ c_i(X, f) = k.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nΣ b_i(X) ≤ k.\n\nNow, let's consider the example of a 2-dimensional torus with a nondegenerate Morse function f having exactly four critical points. The Betti numbers of a 2-dimensional torus are b_0 = 1, b_1 = 2, and b_2 = 1. The sum of the Betti numbers is:\n\nΣ b_i(X) = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\n\nSince the Morse function f has exactly four critical points, the maximum possible value of the total Betti numbers of X is 4, which is equal to the number of critical points."
