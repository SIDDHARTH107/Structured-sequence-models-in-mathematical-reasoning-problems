The company wants to know if there is a statistically significant difference in the average weights of the products produced by three machines. A random sample of 10 products for each machine is taken, and the weights are recorded as follows: \n\nMachine 1: {50, 52, 48, 55, 60, 58, 53, 49, 51, 54} \nMachine 2: {46, 49, 45, 47, 50, 48, 53, 44, 42, 51} \nMachine 3: {57, 60, 62, 65, 63, 64, 59, 61, 58, 62} \n\nAssuming that the weights are normally distributed and that the variances of the three populations are equal, conduct an ANOVA test at a significance level of 0.05 to determine if there is a significant difference in the average weights produced by the three machines.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we first need to calculate the means and variances for each machine, as well as the overall mean. \n\nMachine 1: \nMean (M1) = (50+52+48+55+60+58+53+49+51+54)/10 = 530/10 = 53\n\nMachine 2: \nMean (M2) = (46+49+45+47+50+48+53+44+42+51)/10 = 475/10 = 47.5\n\nMachine 3: \nMean (M3) = (57+60+62+65+63+64+59+61+58+62)/10 = 611/10 = 61.1\n\nOverall Mean (Grand Mean, GM) = (530+475+611)/30 = 1616/30 = 53.87\n\nNext, we calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB), Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW), and the Total Sum of Squares (SST).\n\nSSB = Σn_i*(Mean_i - GM)^2\nSSB = 10*(53-53.87)^2 + 10*(47.5-53.87)^2 + 10*(61.1-53.87)^2 = 10*(0.87^2) + 10*(-6.37^2) + 10*(7.23^2) = 10*(0.7569) + 10*(40.5769) + 10*(52.2729) = 7.569 + 405.769 + 522.729 = 936.067\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - Mean_i)^2\nSSW = (0^2+2^2+(-5)^2+2^2+7^2+5^2+0^2+(-4)^2+(-2)^2+1^2) + ((-1)^2+2^2+(-2)^2+0^2+3^2+1^2+6^2+(-3)^2+(-5)^2+4^2) + ((-4)^2+(-1)^2+1^2+4^2+2^2+3^2+(-2)^2+0^2+(-3)^2+1^2) = 135 + 90 + 66 = 291\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 936.067 + 291 = 1227.067\n\nNow, we calculate the Mean Squares Between Groups (MSB), Mean Squares Within Groups (MSW), and the F-statistic.\n\nMSB = SSB/(k-1) = 936.067/(3-1) = 936.067/2 = 468.0335\nMSW = SSW/(N-k) = 291/(30-3) = 291/27 = 10.7778\n\nF-statistic = MSB/MSW = 468.0335/10.7778 = 43.418\n\nNow, we compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table. The degrees of freedom for the numerator (df1) is k-1 = 3-1 = 2, and the degrees of freedom for the denominator (df2) is N-k = 30-3 = 27. At a significance level of 0.05, the critical value for F(2,27) is approximately 3.354.\n\nSince our F-statistic (43.418) is greater than the critical value (3.354), we reject the null hypothesis. There is a statistically significant difference in the average weights produced by the three machines at a significance level of 0.05."
