    "message_2": "To find the zeros and poles of the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 + 2z + 1), we first need to find the zeros of the numerator and the poles of the denominator.\n\nZeros of the numerator (z^3 - 1):\nWe can factor the numerator as (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1). Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n1. z - 1 = 0 => z = 1\n2. z^2 + z + 1 = 0\n\nFor the quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1:\n\nz = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4*1*1)) / 2*1\nz = (-1 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nThe roots are complex conjugates: z = -1/2 + (√3/2)i and z = -1/2 - (√3/2)i.\n\nNow we check which zeros are within the unit circle |z| = 1:\n\n1. |1| = 1 (on the boundary of the unit circle)\n2. |-1/2 + (√3/2)i| = √((-1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2) = √(1/4 + 3/4) = √1 = 1 (on the boundary of the unit circle)\n3. |-1/2 - (√3/2)i| = √((-1/2)^2 + (-√3/2)^2) = √(1/4 + 3/4) = √1 = 1 (on the boundary of the unit circle)\n\nNone of the zeros are strictly within the unit circle |z| = 1.\n\nPoles of the denominator (z^2 + 2z + 1):\nWe can factor the denominator as (z + 1)^2. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n1. z + 1 = 0 => z = -1\n\nNow we check if the pole is within the unit circle |z| = 1:\n\n1. |-1| = 1 (on the boundary of the unit circle)\n\nThe pole is not strictly within the unit circle |z| = 1.\n\nIn conclusion, there are no zeros and no poles of the complex function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 + 2z + 1) strictly within the unit circle |z| = 1."
