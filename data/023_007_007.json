    "message_1": "A signal consists of a continuous-time periodic square wave with a frequency of 200 Hz. Use the Fourier transform to find the amplitudes and phases of the harmonic components up to the 5th harmonic.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitudes and phases of the harmonic components up to the 5th harmonic, we will use the Fourier series representation of a periodic square wave. The Fourier series of a square wave with frequency f and amplitude A can be represented as:\n\nx(t) = A * Σ [ (1/n) * sin(2πnft + φ_n) ] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nwhere n is the harmonic number, and φ_n is the phase of the nth harmonic component. Note that only odd harmonics are present in a square wave.\n\nGiven the frequency f = 200 Hz, we can find the amplitudes and phases of the first five odd harmonics (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th):\n\n1st harmonic (n = 1):\nAmplitude: A * (1/1) = A\nPhase: φ_1 = 0\n\n3rd harmonic (n = 3):\nAmplitude: A * (1/3) = A/3\nPhase: φ_3 = 0\n\n5th harmonic (n = 5):\nAmplitude: A * (1/5) = A/5\nPhase: φ_5 = 0\n\n7th harmonic (n = 7):\nAmplitude: A * (1/7) = A/7\nPhase: φ_7 = 0\n\n9th harmonic (n = 9):\nAmplitude: A * (1/9) = A/9\nPhase: φ_9 = 0\n\nSo, the amplitudes of the harmonic components up to the 5th harmonic are A, A/3, A/5, A/7, and A/9, and their phases are all 0."
