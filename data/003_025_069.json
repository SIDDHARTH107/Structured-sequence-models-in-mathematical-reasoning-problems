    "message_2": "The boat's velocity can be represented as a vector. We can break this vector into its components along the East (x-axis) and North (y-axis) directions.\n\nThe Eastward component of the velocity (Vx) can be found using the cosine of the angle (60 degrees) and the magnitude of the velocity (15 m/s):\n\nVx = 15 * cos(60) = 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 m/s\n\nThe Northward component of the velocity (Vy) can be found using the sine of the angle (60 degrees) and the magnitude of the velocity (15 m/s):\n\nVy = 15 * sin(60) = 15 * (√3/2) = 7.5 * √3 ≈ 12.99 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the velocity relative to the ground using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV = √(Vx^2 + Vy^2) = √(7.5^2 + 12.99^2) ≈ √(56.25 + 168.72) ≈ √224.97 ≈ 14.998 m/s\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Vy / Vx) = arctan(12.99 / 7.5) ≈ 60 degrees\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the ground is approximately 14.998 m/s, and its direction is 60 degrees North of East."
