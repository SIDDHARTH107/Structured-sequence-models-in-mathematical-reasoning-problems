    "message_1": "A radioactive substance with an initial mass of 50 grams has a half-life of 10 years. How much of the substance will remain after 40 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 50 grams, the half-life is 10 years, and the time elapsed is 40 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 50 * (1/2)^(40 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 50 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal mass = 50 * (1/16)\n\nFinal mass = 50 * 0.0625\n\nFinal mass = 3.125 grams\n\nSo, after 40 years, 3.125 grams of the radioactive substance will remain."
