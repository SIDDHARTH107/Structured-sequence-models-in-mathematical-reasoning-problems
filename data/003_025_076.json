    "message_1": "A boat is heading east with a speed of 12 km/hr while the water current is flowing at a speed of 5 km/hr toward the north. Find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground. (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nThe boat's eastward velocity (Vx) is 12 km/hr, and the water current's northward velocity (Vy) is 5 km/hr. We can represent these velocities as a right triangle, with Vx as the base and Vy as the height.\n\nTo find the magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the ground (V), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV = √(Vx^2 + Vy^2)\nV = √(12^2 + 5^2)\nV = √(144 + 25)\nV = √169\nV = 13 km/hr\n\nNow, to find the direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Vy / Vx)\nθ = arctan(5 / 12)\nθ ≈ 22.62 degrees\n\nSince the boat is heading east and the current is flowing north, the direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground is 22.62 degrees north of east.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the ground is 13 km/hr, and its direction is 22.62 degrees north of east."
