    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the noncommutative algebra of differential operators $\\operatorname{Diff}_{\\mathbb{C}}(A)$ on the noncommutative algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}\\langle x,y\\rangle/(yx-xy-1)$, we can use the Poincar√©-Birkhoff-Witt (PBW) theorem.\n\nFirst, let's consider the Lie algebra $L$ generated by $x$ and $y$ with the commutator $[x, y] = yx - xy = 1$. We can construct a universal enveloping algebra $U(L)$, which is a noncommutative associative algebra generated by $x$ and $y$ with the relations $yx - xy = 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the algebra of differential operators $\\operatorname{Diff}_{\\mathbb{C}}(A)$. We can represent a generic element of this algebra as a linear combination of monomials of the form $x^i y^j D_x^k D_y^l$, where $D_x$ and $D_y$ are the partial derivative operators with respect to $x$ and $y$, respectively, and $i, j, k, l$ are non-negative integers.\n\nBy the PBW theorem, there is an isomorphism between the universal enveloping algebra $U(L)$ and the algebra of differential operators $\\operatorname{Diff}_{\\mathbb{C}}(A)$. Therefore, the dimension of $\\operatorname{Diff}_{\\mathbb{C}}(A)$ is the same as the dimension of $U(L)$.\n\nThe dimension of $U(L)$ can be computed as the number of linearly independent monomials of the form $x^i y^j$, where $i, j$ are non-negative integers. Since there are infinitely many such monomials, the dimension of $\\operatorname{Diff}_{\\mathbb{C}}(A)$ is infinite."
