In practice, we would perform a large number of iterations (e.g., 1000 or more) and check if the magnitude of z remains below a certain threshold (e.g., 2) during the entire process. If the magnitude of z remains below the threshold, we can say that the complex number c belongs to the Julia set. If the magnitude of z exceeds the threshold at any point, we can say that the complex number c does not belong to the Julia set.\n\nIn this case, we cannot definitively determine whether the complex number c belongs to the Julia set just by looking at a few iterations. A more thorough analysis with a large number of iterations and a threshold check would be required."
