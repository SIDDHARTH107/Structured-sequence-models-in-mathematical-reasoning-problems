    "message_2": "The given equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$ defines a smooth variety, not a singular one. This equation represents a sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{C}P^3$. Since the variety is smooth, there are no singular points, including the point $(0,0,1)$.\n\nHowever, if you meant to consider the real projective space $\\mathbb{R}P^3$, the equation still defines a smooth variety, which is a 2-sphere $S^2$ in this case. The point $(0,0,1)$ is a regular point on the sphere, and there are no singular points on the sphere.\n\nIn either case, since the variety is smooth, there is no need to compute intersection cohomology, as it coincides with the usual cohomology. For a 2-sphere, the cohomology groups are given by:\n\n$H^0(S^2) = \\mathbb{R}$ (or $\\mathbb{C}$ if considering complex projective space)\n$H^1(S^2) = 0$\n$H^2(S^2) = \\mathbb{R}$ (or $\\mathbb{C}$ if considering complex projective space)\n\nAll other cohomology groups are trivial."
