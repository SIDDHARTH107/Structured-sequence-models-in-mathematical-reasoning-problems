    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways to color the vertices of a graph with 8 vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to consider the structure of the graph. However, since the structure of the graph is not provided, I will assume that it is a simple cycle graph (a closed chain) with 8 vertices, as this is a common type of graph for this type of problem.\n\nIn a cycle graph with an even number of vertices, we can color the vertices in an alternating pattern. There are two possible ways to do this: starting with a red vertex or starting with a blue vertex. For example, if we start with a red vertex, the coloring pattern would be R-B-R-B-R-B-R-B. If we start with a blue vertex, the pattern would be B-R-B-R-B-R-B-R.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 different ways to color a cycle graph with 8 vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color."
