    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg with a length of 5 cm and the other leg with a length of 12 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In equation form, this is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc² = 5² + 12²\nc² = 25 + 144\nc² = 169\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = √169\nc = 13 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is 13 cm."
