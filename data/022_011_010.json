    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 4)/(z - 1)^3 at z = 1, we first need to simplify the function and see if we can cancel out any factors.\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 4)/(z - 1)^3\n= ((z - 2)(z + 2))/((z - 1)^3)\n\nNow, we can see that there is no common factor in the numerator and denominator that can be canceled out. Therefore, the order of the pole at z = 1 is the exponent of (z - 1) in the denominator, which is 3.\n\nSince the order of the pole is 3, it is a higher-order pole (not a simple pole or a double pole)."
