    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one break-in during a seven-day week, we can first find the probability of no break-ins occurring during the week and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no break-in on any given day is 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nThe probability of no break-ins for the entire week (assuming each day is independent) is (0.96)^7.\n\n(0.96)^7 ≈ 0.7514\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one break-in during the week:\n\n1 - 0.7514 ≈ 0.2486\n\nSo, the probability of at least one break-in in the neighborhood during a seven-day week is approximately 0.2486 or 24.86%."
