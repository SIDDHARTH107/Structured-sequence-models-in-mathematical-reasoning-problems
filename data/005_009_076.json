The collected data for income in City A is { $45,000, $50,000, $55,000, $60,000, $65,000} and for City B is { $42,000, $48,000, $52,000, $58,000, $62,000}. \n\nTest whether there is a significant difference in the median income between City A and City B. Use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at the significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we first need to combine the data from both cities and rank them in ascending order.\n\nCombined data: {42000, 45000, 48000, 50000, 52000, 55000, 58000, 60000, 62000, 65000}\n\nRanks: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we assign the ranks to the original data:\n\nCity A: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nCity B: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNext, we calculate the rank sum for each city:\n\nRank sum for City A: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30\nRank sum for City B: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\nNow, we need to find the critical value for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Since we have 5 observations in each city, we can use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test table to find the critical value at a significance level of 0.05. For n1 = n2 = 5, the critical value is 15.\n\nThe rank sum for City B (25) is greater than the critical value (15), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no significant difference in the median income between City A and City B at the 0.05 significance level."
