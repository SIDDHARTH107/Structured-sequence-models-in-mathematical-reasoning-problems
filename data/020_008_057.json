    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has three plants located at (0,0), (5,5), and (10,5) on a coordinate plane. Each plant has a fixed production capacity of 100 units per day. The company has three markets located at (2, 8), (8, 2), and (10, 10) on the same coordinate plane. Each market demands a total of 100 units per day. What is the optimal way to transport goods from the plants to the markets to minimize the total transportation cost if the cost of transportation from a plant to a market is proportional to the distance between them? Assume that each unit of distance costs $1.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal way to transport goods from the plants to the markets, we need to calculate the distances between each plant and each market. We can use the distance formula: distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\n\nDistances from Plant 1 (0,0) to the markets:\nMarket 1 (2,8): sqrt((2-0)^2 + (8-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 64) = sqrt(68)\nMarket 2 (8,2): sqrt((8-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(64 + 4) = sqrt(68)\nMarket 3 (10,10): sqrt((10-0)^2 + (10-0)^2) = sqrt(100 + 100) = sqrt(200)\n\nDistances from Plant 2 (5,5) to the markets:\nMarket 1 (2,8): sqrt((2-5)^2 + (8-5)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18)\nMarket 2 (8,2): sqrt((8-5)^2 + (2-5)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18)\nMarket 3 (10,10): sqrt((10-5)^2 + (10-5)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50)\n\nDistances from Plant 3 (10,5) to the markets:\nMarket 1 (2,8): sqrt((2-10)^2 + (8-5)^2) = sqrt(64 + 9) = sqrt(73)\nMarket 2 (8,2): sqrt((8-10)^2 + (2-5)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13)\nMarket 3 (10,10): sqrt((10-10)^2 + (10-5)^2) = sqrt(0 + 25) = sqrt(25)\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal distribution of goods to minimize the total transportation cost.\n\nPlant 1 (0,0) should send goods to Market 1 (2,8) and Market 2 (8,2) since both distances are sqrt(68).\nPlant 2 (5,5) should send goods to Market 1 (2,8) and Market 2 (8,2) since both distances are sqrt(18).\nPlant 3 (10,5) should send goods to Market 2 (8,2) and Market 3 (10,10) since the distances are sqrt(13) and sqrt(25), respectively.\n\nThe total transportation cost will be:\nPlant 1: 100 * sqrt(68) + 100 * sqrt(68) = 200 * sqrt(68)\nPlant 2: 100 * sqrt(18) + 100 * sqrt(18) = 200 * sqrt(18)\nPlant 3: 100 * sqrt(13) + 100 * sqrt(25) = 100 * sqrt(13) + 100 * 5\n\nTotal cost = 200 * sqrt(68) + 200 * sqrt(18) + 100 * sqrt(13) + 500\n\nThis is the optimal way to transport goods from the plants to the markets to minimize the total transportation cost."
