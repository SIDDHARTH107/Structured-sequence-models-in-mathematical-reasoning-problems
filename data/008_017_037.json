    "message_2": "The sparse matrix method is not suitable for solving this system of linear equations, as it is designed for matrices with a large number of zero elements, which is not the case here. Instead, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve this system.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 24 |\n| 5  6  7 | 52 |\n| 8  9 10 | 81 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element of the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - (5/2)R1\nR3 = R3 - 4R1\n\n|  2   3   4 |  24 |\n|  0  -1.5  -3 |   4 |\n|  0  -3  -6 |   9 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element of the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 2R2\n\n|  2   3   4 |  24 |\n|  0  -1.5  -3 |   4 |\n|  0   0   0 |   1 |\n\nThe third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the given system of linear equations has no solution."
