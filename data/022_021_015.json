    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of f(t) = t^3e^(at) using the complex analysis method, we first need to recall the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(from 0 to ∞) e^(-st)f(t) dt\n\nIn our case, f(t) = t^3e^(at), so we have:\n\nF(s) = ∫(from 0 to ∞) e^(-st)t^3e^(at) dt\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(s) = ∫(from 0 to ∞) t^3e^((a-s)t) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let's choose u = t^3 and dv = e^((a-s)t) dt. Then, we have:\n\ndu = 3t^2 dt\nv = ∫ e^((a-s)t) dt = (1/(a-s))e^((a-s)t)\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = uv |(from 0 to ∞) - ∫(from 0 to ∞) v du\n\nF(s) = [(t^3)(1/(a-s))e^((a-s)t)](from 0 to ∞) - ∫(from 0 to ∞) (1/(a-s))e^((a-s)t) * 3t^2 dt\n\nThe first term in the brackets vanishes as t goes to infinity, and the second term is zero when t = 0. So, we are left with:\n\nF(s) = -3/(a-s) * ∫(from 0 to ∞) t^2e^((a-s)t) dt\n\nNow, we need to apply integration by parts two more times to solve the remaining integral. After doing this, we get:\n\nF(s) = 6/((s-a)^4)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform to get the function back in the time domain:\n\nf(t) = L^(-1){F(s)} = L^(-1){6/((s-a)^4)}\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform properties and tables, we find that:\n\nf(t) = t^3e^(at)\n\nSo, the corresponding function in the time domain is f(t) = t^3e^(at), which is the same as the original function."
