    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nLet's consider two odd numbers, a and b. By definition, an odd number can be represented as 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, we can write a = 2m + 1 and b = 2n + 1, where m and n are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of these two odd numbers:\n\na + b = (2m + 1) + (2n + 1)\n\nBy rearranging the terms, we get:\n\na + b = 2m + 2n + 2\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the expression:\n\na + b = 2(m + n + 1)\n\nSince m and n are integers, their sum (m + n) is also an integer. Therefore, (m + n + 1) is also an integer. Let's call this integer k:\n\na + b = 2k\n\nSince the sum of the two odd numbers can be represented as a multiple of 2, it is an even number by definition.\n\nNow, let's verify this statement with an example:\n\nLet's choose two odd numbers, for instance, 3 and 5.\n\n3 = 2(1) + 1\n5 = 2(2) + 1\n\nNow, let's find the sum of these two odd numbers:\n\n3 + 5 = (2(1) + 1) + (2(2) + 1) = 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8\n\nThe sum of the two odd numbers, 3 and 5, is 8, which is an even number. This verifies the statement that the sum of two odd numbers is an even number."
