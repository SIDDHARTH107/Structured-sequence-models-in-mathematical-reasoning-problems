    "message_2": "To find the value of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to calculate the following variables:\n\n1. d1: The sensitivity of the option price to the underlying stock price.\n2. d2: The sensitivity of the option price to the time-to-maturity.\n3. N(d1) and N(d2): The cumulative normal distribution function values for d1 and d2.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given parameters into the appropriate units:\n\n- Stock price (S) = $50\n- Strike price (K) = $55\n- Risk-free interest rate (r) = 0.05 (5% per annum)\n- Volatility (σ) = 0.20 (20% per annum)\n- Time-to-maturity (T) = 30 days = 30/365 = 0.0822 years (approx.)\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2 using the following formulas:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nd1 = (ln(50/55) + (0.05 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.0822) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.0822))\nd1 = (-0.0953 + (0.05 + 0.02) * 0.0822) / (0.20 * 0.2869)\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.0058) / 0.0574\nd1 = -0.0895 / 0.0574\nd1 ≈ -1.56\n\nd2 = -1.56 - 0.20 * 0.2869\nd2 ≈ -1.56 - 0.0574\nd2 ≈ -1.62\n\nNow, we need to find the cumulative normal distribution function values for d1 and d2:\n\nN(d1) = N(-1.56) ≈ 0.0594\nN(d2) = N(-1.62) ≈ 0.0527\n\nFinally, we can calculate the value of the European call option (C) using the Black-Scholes equation:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nC = 50 * 0.0594 - 55 * e^(-0.05 * 0.0822) * 0.0527\nC = 2.97 - 55 * e^(-0.00411) * 0.0527\nC = 2.97 - 54.18 * 0.0527\nC = 2.97 - 2.855\nC ≈ 0.115\n\nSo, the value of the European call option is approximately $0.115."
