    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext produced by the Playfair cipher, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key \"MATH\". The matrix will be filled with the remaining letters of the alphabet in order, excluding \"J\" (since \"I\" and \"J\" share the same position in the matrix).\n\nThe matrix will look like this:\n\nM A T H B\nC D E F G\nI K L N O\nP Q R S U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we need to break the plaintext \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, we insert an \"X\" between them. In this case, we don't need to insert any \"X\".\n\nPlaintext digraphs: CR YP TO GR AP HY\n\nNow, we apply the Playfair cipher rules to each digraph:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their immediate right (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle.\n\nApplying these rules, we get the following ciphertext digraphs:\n\nCiphertext digraphs: IM LD UO FN AK UY\n\nFinally, we combine the digraphs to get the ciphertext: IMLDUOFNAKUY"
