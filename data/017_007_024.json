    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will use the properties of groups and the Sylow Theorems.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions of C6 and D3:\n\nC6 is the cyclic group of order 6, generated by an element a with the property that a^6 = e (the identity element), and all other powers of a are distinct.\n\nD3 is the dihedral group of order 6, which can be thought of as the symmetries of an equilateral triangle. It has a presentation D3 = <r, s | r^3 = s^2 = e, rs = sr^2>, where r represents a rotation and s represents a reflection.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G of order 6. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 2. Let H be the subgroup of order 3 and K be the subgroup of order 2.\n\nSince H has order 3, it must be cyclic, so H = <a> for some a in G with a^3 = e. Similarly, K has order 2, so K = <b> for some b in G with b^2 = e.\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: a and b commute, i.e., ab = ba.\nIn this case, we can show that G is isomorphic to C6. Consider the element c = ab. Then, c^6 = (ab)^6 = a^6b^6 = e^2 = e, since a^3 = b^2 = e. Also, all powers of c are distinct, so G = <c> is a cyclic group of order 6, which is isomorphic to C6.\n\nCase 2: a and b do not commute, i.e., ab ≠ ba.\nIn this case, we can show that G is isomorphic to D3. Define r = a and s = b. Then, r^3 = a^3 = e and s^2 = b^2 = e. Since ab ≠ ba, we have that rs ≠ sr. We claim that rs = sr^2. To see this, note that (rs)^2 = r^2s^2 = r^2, and (sr^2)^2 = s^2r^4 = r^2. Since both (rs)^2 and (sr^2)^2 are equal to r^2, and r^2 has order 2 in G, we have that rs = sr^2. Thus, G has the presentation <r, s | r^3 = s^2 = e, rs = sr^2>, which is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C6 or D3, depending on whether the elements a and b commute or not."
