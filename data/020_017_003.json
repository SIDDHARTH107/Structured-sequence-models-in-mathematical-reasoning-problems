    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to minimize the cost of producing a rectangular box with a base area of 60 square feet and a height of 4 feet. The cost of the material for the top and bottom is $0.20 per square foot, and the cost of the material for the sides is $0.10 per square foot. What are the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of material?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the box be x and the width be y. The base area is given as 60 square feet, so we have the equation:\n\nx * y = 60\n\nThe height of the box is given as 4 feet. The cost of the material for the top and bottom is $0.20 per square foot, and the cost of the material for the sides is $0.10 per square foot. So, the total cost (C) can be expressed as:\n\nC = 0.20 * (x * y) + 0.10 * (2 * x * 4 + 2 * y * 4)\nC = 0.20 * (60) + 0.10 * (8x + 8y)\n\nSince x * y = 60, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 60/x\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y in the cost function:\n\nC(x) = 12 + 0.10 * (8x + 8 * (60/x))\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find the critical points of the function C(x) by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nC'(x) = d/dx [12 + 0.10 * (8x + 480/x)]\n\nUsing the sum and product rules for differentiation, we get:\n\nC'(x) = 0.10 * (8 - 480/x^2)\n\nSetting C'(x) = 0:\n\n0 = 8 - 480/x^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2:\n\n0 = 8x^2 - 480\n\nAdding 480 to both sides:\n\n8x^2 = 480\n\nDividing both sides by 8:\n\nx^2 = 60\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nx = √60\n\nSince x and y are interchangeable (the box can be rotated), we can also find y:\n\ny = 60/x = 60/√60 = √60\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of material are length x = √60 feet and width y = √60 feet."
