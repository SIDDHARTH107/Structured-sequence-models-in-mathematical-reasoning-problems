    "message_1": "A system has 5 components with individual failure probabilities of 0.02, 0.03, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04, respectively. What is the probability that at least one component will fail?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component will fail, we can first find the probability that none of the components fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a component does not fail is equal to 1 minus its failure probability. So, for each component, we have:\n\nComponent 1: 1 - 0.02 = 0.98\nComponent 2: 1 - 0.03 = 0.97\nComponent 3: 1 - 0.01 = 0.99\nComponent 4: 1 - 0.02 = 0.98\nComponent 5: 1 - 0.04 = 0.96\n\nNow, we find the probability that none of the components fail by multiplying the probabilities of each component not failing:\n\nP(None fail) = 0.98 * 0.97 * 0.99 * 0.98 * 0.96 ≈ 0.8853\n\nFinally, we find the probability that at least one component will fail by subtracting the probability that none of them fail from 1:\n\nP(At least one fails) = 1 - P(None fail) = 1 - 0.8853 ≈ 0.1147\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component will fail is approximately 0.1147 or 11.47%."
