    "message_2": "To determine if G is a connected graph, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 10, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\nSince G has 15 edges, which is greater than the minimum required (9 edges), it is possible for G to be a connected graph. However, this does not guarantee that G is connected, as the edges could be distributed in such a way that some vertices are not connected to the rest of the graph.\n\nTo guarantee that G is connected, we can use the fact that a complete graph (a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex) with n vertices has n(n-1)/2 edges. In this case, n = 10, so a complete graph would have 10(10-1)/2 = 45 edges.\n\nSince G has 15 edges, which is less than the number of edges in a complete graph (45 edges), it is not guaranteed that G is connected. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine whether G is a connected graph or not based solely on the number of vertices and edges."
