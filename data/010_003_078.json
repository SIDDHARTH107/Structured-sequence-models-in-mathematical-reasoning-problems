    "message_2": "Assume for contradiction that A ∩ B is empty, i.e., A and B are disjoint. Since A and B are nonempty, we can pick a point a ∈ A and a point b ∈ B. Since X is a topological space where every two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open sets, there exist open sets U and V in X such that a ∈ U, b ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nNow, consider the sets A ∩ U and A ∩ V. Since U contains a and V contains no points of A, A ∩ U is nonempty. Similarly, since V contains b and U contains no points of B, B ∩ V is nonempty. Moreover, (A ∩ U) ∩ (B ∩ V) = (A ∩ B) ∩ (U ∩ V) = ∅, so A ∩ U and B ∩ V are disjoint.\n\nWe claim that A ∩ U and A ∩ V form a separation of A. Indeed, A ∩ U and A ∩ V are both open in A, since they are intersections of A with open sets in X. Moreover, (A ∩ U) ∪ (A ∩ V) = A ∩ (U ∪ V) = A, since U ∪ V contains all points of A. Thus, A ∩ U and A ∩ V are nonempty, open, and disjoint subsets of A whose union is A, which contradicts the assumption that A is connected.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that B ∩ U and B ∩ V form a separation of B, which contradicts the assumption that B is connected.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that A ∩ B is empty must be false, and A ∩ B is nonempty."
