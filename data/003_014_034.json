    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift of the given function y = 2sin(3x - π/4) + 1, we can compare it with the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nA = 2\nB = 3\nC = π/4\nD = 1\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which determines the peak value of the sinusoidal function. In this case, the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sinusoidal function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In our case, B = 3, so the period is (2π)/3.\n\n3. Phase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value of C, which determines the horizontal shift of the sinusoidal function. In this case, the phase shift is π/4. Since the term inside the sine function is (3x - π/4), the phase shift is positive, meaning the graph is shifted to the right by π/4 units.\n\n4. Vertical Shift (D): The vertical shift is the value of D, which determines the vertical shift of the sinusoidal function. In this case, the vertical shift is 1, meaning the graph is shifted up by 1 unit.\n\nSo, the function y = 2sin(3x - π/4) + 1 has an amplitude of 2, a period of (2π)/3, a phase shift of π/4 to the right, and a vertical shift of 1 unit up."
