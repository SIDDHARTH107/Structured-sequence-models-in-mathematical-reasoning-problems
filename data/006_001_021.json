    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (heads)\n- p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (1 - p = 0.5)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 10, k = 6, p = 0.5, and q = 0.5.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of combinations (10C6):\n\n10! / (6!(10-6)!) = 10! / (6!4!) = 210\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = (210) * (0.5^6) * (0.5^4)\n\nP(X = 6) = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625\n\nP(X = 6) â‰ˆ 0.205078125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 coin flips is approximately 20.51%."
