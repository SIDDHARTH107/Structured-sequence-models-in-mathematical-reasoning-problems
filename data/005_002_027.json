    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean exam score, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence), σ is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 75, σ = 5, and n = 50.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean:\n\nSE = σ / √n = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME) using the Z-score:\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.386\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean exam score:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± ME = 75 ± 1.386\n\nLower Bound = 75 - 1.386 ≈ 73.614\nUpper Bound = 75 + 1.386 ≈ 76.386\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean exam score is approximately (73.614, 76.386)."
