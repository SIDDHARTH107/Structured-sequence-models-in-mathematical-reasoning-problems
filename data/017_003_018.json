    "message_2": "A generator of a group of prime order p is an element g in the group such that its powers generate all the non-identity elements of the group. In other words, g has order p.\n\nFor a group of prime order 17, we need to find an element g such that g^17 = 1 (mod 17) and g^k ≠ 1 (mod 17) for all 1 ≤ k < 17.\n\nLet's consider the group of integers modulo 17 under multiplication, denoted as (Z/17Z)^×. This group has order 16 (since there are 16 non-zero elements in the set {1, 2, ..., 16}).\n\nWe can check the powers of each element in the group to find a generator:\n\n1. 1^k = 1 (mod 17) for all k, so 1 is not a generator.\n\n2. 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 15, 2^6 = 13, 2^7 = 9, 2^8 = 1 (mod 17). Since 2^8 = 1 (mod 17), 2 is not a generator.\n\n3. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 10, 3^4 = 13, 3^5 = 5, 3^6 = 15, 3^7 = 11, 3^8 = 16, 3^9 = 14, 3^10 = 8, 3^11 = 7, 3^12 = 4, 3^13 = 12, 3^14 = 2, 3^15 = 6, 3^16 = 1 (mod 17). Since 3^16 = 1 (mod 17) and none of the previous powers are 1, 3 is a generator of the group of order 17.\n\nSo, the generator of a group of prime order 17 is 3."
