    "message_1": "Suppose the average salary of teachers in a certain school district is $50,000 with a standard deviation of $3,000. If a random sample of 100 teachers is taken from the district, what is the 95% confidence interval for the mean salary of teachers in the district?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean salary of teachers in the district, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence interval = Mean ± (Z-score * (Standard deviation / √Sample size))\n\nHere, the mean is $50,000, the standard deviation is $3,000, and the sample size is 100.\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (which corresponds to the critical value for a two-tailed test with a 0.05 level of significance).\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nConfidence interval = $50,000 ± (1.96 * ($3,000 / √100))\n\nConfidence interval = $50,000 ± (1.96 * ($3,000 / 10))\n\nConfidence interval = $50,000 ± (1.96 * $300)\n\nConfidence interval = $50,000 ± $588\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean salary of teachers in the district is from $49,412 to $50,588."
