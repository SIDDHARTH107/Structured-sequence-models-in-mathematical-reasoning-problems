    "message_2": "In the unit circle, an angle of 45 degrees (or π/4 radians) has the same x and y coordinates, since it is halfway between the x-axis and y-axis. The coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to a 45-degree angle are (1/√2, 1/√2) or (√2/2, √2/2).\n\nThe sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle are defined as follows:\n\nsine (sin) = opposite side / hypotenuse\ncosine (cos) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ntangent (tan) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nFor a 45-degree angle in the unit circle:\n\nsin(45°) = y-coordinate = 1/√2 or √2/2\ncos(45°) = x-coordinate = 1/√2 or √2/2\ntan(45°) = sin(45°) / cos(45°) = (1/√2) / (1/√2) = 1\n\nSo, the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for a 45-degree angle are:\n\nsin(45°) = √2/2\ncos(45°) = √2/2\ntan(45°) = 1"
