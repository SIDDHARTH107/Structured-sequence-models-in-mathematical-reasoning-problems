    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, the two congruent sides are a = b = 9 cm, and the angle between them is C = 36 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nRadians = (Degrees * π) / 180\nRadians = (36 * π) / 180\nRadians ≈ 0.628 radians\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side (c):\n\nc² = 9² + 9² - 2 * 9 * 9 * cos(0.628)\nc² = 81 + 81 - 162 * cos(0.628)\nc² ≈ 162 - 162 * 0.809\nc² ≈ 162 - 131.058\nc² ≈ 30.942\n\nNow, we find the square root of c² to get the length of the third side:\n\nc ≈ √30.942\nc ≈ 5.56 cm\n\nThe length of the third side of the isosceles triangle is approximately 5.56 cm."
