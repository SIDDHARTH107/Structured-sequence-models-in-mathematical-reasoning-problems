    "message_1": "Alice wants to make a cake shop where she will sell two types of cakes: chocolate and vanilla. A chocolate cake requires 200 grams of flour, 100 grams of sugar, and 50 grams of butter, and it sells for $10. A vanilla cake requires 150 grams of flour, 75 grams of sugar, and 75 grams of butter, and it sells for $8. Alice has 2,000 grams of flour, 1,000 grams of sugar and 500 grams of butter available. What is the maximum profit that Alice can make if she wants to sell all the cakes she makes? Use matrix methods to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chocolate cakes and y be the number of vanilla cakes. We can set up the following system of linear inequalities to represent the constraints on the ingredients:\n\n200x + 150y ≤ 2000 (flour constraint)\n100x + 75y ≤ 1000 (sugar constraint)\n50x + 75y ≤ 500 (butter constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 8y.\n\nTo solve this problem using matrix methods, we can first convert the inequalities into a matrix inequality:\n\nA * X ≤ B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants:\n\nA = | 200  150 |\n    | 100  75  |\n    | 50   75  |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 2000 |\n    | 1000 |\n    | 500  |\n\nNow we can find the feasible region by graphing the inequalities:\n\n200x + 150y ≤ 2000\n100x + 75y ≤ 1000\n50x + 75y ≤ 500\n\nThe feasible region is a convex polygon with vertices (0, 0), (0, 6.67), (4, 6), (10, 0). We can evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 8y at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 0\nP(0, 6.67) = 53.36\nP(4, 6) = 76\nP(10, 0) = 100\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (10, 0), which corresponds to making 10 chocolate cakes and 0 vanilla cakes. Therefore, the maximum profit Alice can make is $100."
