    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices. Let's find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices:\n\n1. 1-2: 1\n2. 1-3: 1-2-3 (2 steps)\n3. 1-4: 1\n4. 1-5: 1-2-5 or 1-4-5 (2 steps)\n5. 1-6: 1-2-3-6 or 1-4-5-6 (3 steps)\n6. 2-3: 1\n7. 2-4: 2-1-4 or 2-5-4 (2 steps)\n8. 2-5: 1\n9. 2-6: 2-3-6 or 2-5-6 (2 steps)\n10. 3-4: 3-2-1-4 or 3-6-5-4 (3 steps)\n11. 3-5: 3-2-5 or 3-6-5 (2 steps)\n12. 3-6: 1\n13. 4-5: 1\n14. 4-6: 4-5-6 (2 steps)\n15. 5-6: 1\n\nThe longest shortest path is 3 steps, which occurs between vertices 1-6 and 3-4. Therefore, the diameter of the graph is 3."
