    "message_1": "A factor analysis was performed to determine the underlying factors influencing student performance on a math exam. The results showed that two factors accounted for 80% of the variance in scores. Factor 1 had an eigenvalue of 4.5 and explained 50% of the variance, while factor 2 had an eigenvalue of 1.5 and explained 30% of the variance. What is the total variance explained by all factors in the analysis?",
    "message_2": "Since the two factors accounted for 80% of the variance in scores, we can find the total variance by dividing the variance explained by these two factors by the percentage they account for.\n\nLet V be the total variance.\n\nFactor 1: 0.50 * V = 4.5 (eigenvalue)\nFactor 2: 0.30 * V = 1.5 (eigenvalue)\n\nTogether, they account for 80% of the variance:\n0.80 * V = 4.5 + 1.5 = 6\n\nNow, we can solve for V:\n\nV = 6 / 0.80\nV = 7.5\n\nThe total variance explained by all factors in the analysis is 7.5."
