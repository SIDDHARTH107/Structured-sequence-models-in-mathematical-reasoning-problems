    "message_2": "To find the smallest value of \"c\" that produces a divergent sequence, we need to analyze the behavior of the quadratic recurrence relation $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ with $z_0 = 0$. \n\nSince $z_0 = 0$, we have:\n\n$z_1 = z_0^2 + c = 0^2 + c = c$\n\nNow, we can find $z_2$:\n\n$z_2 = z_1^2 + c = c^2 + c$\n\nContinuing this process, we can find $z_3$:\n\n$z_3 = z_2^2 + c = (c^2 + c)^2 + c = c^4 + 2c^3 + c^2 + c$\n\nWe can see that the terms in the sequence are becoming more complicated, but we can still analyze their behavior. A sequence is divergent if its terms grow without bound as $n$ increases. In this case, we want to find the smallest value of \"c\" such that the sequence becomes divergent before or at $n = 100$.\n\nWe can analyze the behavior of the sequence by looking at the highest degree term in each $z_n$. As we can see, the highest degree term in $z_3$ is $c^4$. As we continue to iterate, the highest degree term will keep increasing, and the sequence will eventually become dominated by the highest degree term.\n\nSince we want the sequence to diverge, we need the highest degree term to grow without bound. This means that the coefficient of the highest degree term must be positive. In other words, we need the value of \"c\" to be positive.\n\nNow, let's find the smallest positive value of \"c\" that makes the sequence divergent before or at $n = 100$. We can do this by analyzing the behavior of the sequence for different values of \"c\" and checking if the sequence becomes divergent.\n\nLet's try $c = 0.01$:\n\n$z_1 = 0.01$\n\n$z_2 = 0.01^2 + 0.01 = 0.0101$\n\n$z_3 = (0.0101)^2 + 0.01 = 0.01020101$\n\nAs we can see, the sequence is not diverging yet. We can continue to try different values of \"c\" until we find the smallest value that makes the sequence divergent.\n\nAfter trying different values of \"c\", we find that the smallest value of \"c\" that makes the sequence divergent before or at $n = 100$ is approximately $c = 0.25$. Here's the behavior of the sequence for $c = 0.25$:\n\n$z_1 = 0.25$\n\n$z_2 = 0.25^2 + 0.25 = 0.3125$\n\n$z_3 = (0.3125)^2 + 0.25 = 0.34765625$\n\nAs we continue to iterate, the sequence becomes divergent before $n = 100$. Therefore, the smallest value of \"c\" that produces a divergent sequence for $z_0 = 0$ when iterating until $n = 100$ is approximately $c = 0.25$."
