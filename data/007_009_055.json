    "message_2": "The Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To find the value of φ(42), we first need to find the prime factors of 42.\n\n42 = 2 * 3 * 7\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor 42, we have:\n\nφ(42) = 42 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/7)\nφ(42) = 42 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (6/7)\nφ(42) = 42 * (1/3) * (6/7)\nφ(42) = 42 * (2/7)\nφ(42) = 12\n\nSo, the value of the Euler's totient function of 42 is 12."
