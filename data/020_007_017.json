Find the smallest value in each row and subtract it from all the values in that row.\n2. Find the smallest value in each column and subtract it from all the values in that column.\n3. Cover all zeros in the matrix using the minimum number of lines (rows and columns).\n4. If the number of lines is equal to the number of rows (or columns), an optimal assignment can be found. If not, go to step 5.\n5. Find the smallest uncovered value and subtract it from all uncovered values. Add it to the values at the intersection of the lines.
