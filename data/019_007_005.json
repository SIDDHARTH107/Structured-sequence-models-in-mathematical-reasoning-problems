    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem in Non-monotonic logic:\n\nGiven the following premises, determine if the conclusion is true or false:\nPremise 1: All birds have feathers.\nPremise 2: Tweety is a bird.\nPremise 3: Tweety can't fly.\nConclusion: Tweety has feathers.\n\nIs the conclusion true or false? Provide a justification for your answer.",
    "message_2": "The conclusion is true. Here's the justification:\n\nAccording to Premise 1, all birds have feathers. Since Premise 2 states that Tweety is a bird, we can deduce that Tweety has feathers. The fact that Tweety can't fly (Premise 3) does not affect the conclusion, as it is unrelated to the presence of feathers. Therefore, the conclusion that Tweety has feathers is true."
