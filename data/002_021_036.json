    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (Central Angle / 360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere Area is the area of the sector, Central Angle is the angle in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (60 / 360) * π * 7^2\n\nArea = (1/6) * π * 49\n\nArea = 49π/6\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nArea ≈ 49 * 3.14 / 6\n\nArea ≈ 153.86 / 6\n\nArea ≈ 25.6433\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the area of the sector is approximately 25.64 square centimeters."
