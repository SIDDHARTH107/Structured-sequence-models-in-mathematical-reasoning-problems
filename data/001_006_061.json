    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a quadratic equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = 2x² - 5x + 2\n\nNow, we can try to factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to find the x-intercepts. In this case, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 2, b = -5, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)² - 4(2)(2))) / (2 * 2)\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 - 16)) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± √9) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± 3) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (5 + 3) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2\n\nx = (5 - 3) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = 2x² - 5x + 2 are x = 2 and x = 1/2."
