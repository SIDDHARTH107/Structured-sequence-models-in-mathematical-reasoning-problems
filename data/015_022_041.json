    "message_1": "Consider the Mackey-Glass equation given by:\n\ndx/dt = (0.2x(t - τ)) / (1 + x(t - τ)^10) - 0.1x(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the population density at time t and τ is the time delay. If we take the initial condition x(0) = 1.5 and time delay τ = 17, find the population density at time t = 50 using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.01.",
    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we need to implement the following steps:\n\n1. Define the function for the Mackey-Glass equation.\n2. Implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n3. Initialize the initial conditions and parameters.\n4. Iterate through the time steps and calculate the population density at each step.\n\nLet's start by defining the function for the Mackey-Glass equation:\n\n```python\ndef mackey_glass(x_t, x_t_minus_tau):\n    return (0.2 * x_t_minus_tau) / (1 + x_t_minus_tau**10) - 0.1 * x_t\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\ndef runge_kutta_4(x, t, h, tau, x_history):\n    k1 = h * mackey_glass(x, x_history[-tau])\n    k2 = h * mackey_glass(x + 0.5 * k1, x_history[-tau // 2])\n    k3 = h * mackey_glass(x + 0.5 * k2, x_history[-tau // 2])\n    k4 = h * mackey_glass(x + k3, x_history[-tau])\n    return x + (k1 + 2 * k2 + 2 * k3 + k4) / 6\n```\n\nNow, let's initialize the initial conditions and parameters:\n\n```python\nx_0 = 1.5\ntau = 17\nt_end = 50\nh = 0.01\nn_steps = int(t_end / h)\n```\n\nWe also need to initialize the history of x values to handle the time delay:\n\n```python\nx_history = [x_0] * (tau + n_steps)\n```\n\nNow, let's iterate through the time steps and calculate the population density at each step:\n\n```python\nx = x_0\nfor i in range(n_steps):\n    x = runge_kutta_4(x, i * h, h, tau, x_history)\n    x_history.append(x)\n```\n\nFinally, we can find the population density at time t = 50:\n\n```python\nx_t_50 = x_history[-1]\nprint(\"Population density at time t = 50:\", x_t_50)\n```\n\nThis code will output the population density at time t = 50 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.01. Note that the actual value may vary slightly depending on the implementation and numerical errors."
