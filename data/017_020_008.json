    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphism classes for a group of order 40, we will use the Sylow theorems. A group of order 40 has the form 40 = 2^3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 5.\n2. n_5 divides 8 and n_5 is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 8.\n\nNow, we consider the possible isomorphism classes for each combination of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in the group G. The group G is then the internal direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 8\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and eight Sylow 5-subgroups. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. The group G is then a semidirect product of P_2 and a Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since P_5 is isomorphic to C5, there are four possible actions of P_5 on P_2 (by automorphisms), which correspond to the four non-abelian groups of order 40 with a normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are five Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since P_5 is unique, it is normal in G. The group G is then a semidirect product of P_5 and a Sylow 2-subgroup P_2. Since P_2 is isomorphic to either C8, C4 x C2, or D4, there are three possible actions of P_2 on P_5 (by automorphisms), which correspond to the three non-abelian groups of order 40 with a normal Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 8\nIn this case, there are five Sylow 2-subgroups and eight Sylow 5-subgroups. There is no normal Sylow subgroup in G. However, we can still form a semidirect product of a Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. The dihedral group D20 is an example of such a group.\n\nIn summary, we have found the following isomorphism classes for a group of order 40:\n\n1. The cyclic group C40\n2. The dihedral group D20\n3. Four non-abelian groups with a normal Sylow 2-subgroup\n4. Three non-abelian groups with a normal Sylow 5-subgroup\n\nThese groups exhaust all possible isomorphism classes for a group of order 40."
