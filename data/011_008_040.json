    "message_1": "A group of 6 students is planning a trip to a nearby city. They want to split themselves into 3 pairs to share hotel rooms. In how many ways can they do this using Stirling numbers of the second kind?",
    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. However, in this case, we are not looking for a partition into subsets, but rather a partition into distinct pairs.\n\nInstead, we can solve this problem using combinatorics. There are 6 students, and we want to divide them into 3 pairs. We can approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. Choose the first pair: There are C(6, 2) ways to choose the first pair of students, where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of n elements taken k at a time. C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15.\n\n2. Choose the second pair: After choosing the first pair, there are 4 students left. There are C(4, 2) ways to choose the second pair of students. C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6.\n\n3. The third pair: The remaining 2 students will form the third pair, so there is only 1 way to choose the third pair.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to choose each pair to get the total number of ways to divide the 6 students into 3 pairs: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the arrangements since the order of the pairs does not matter. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the 3 pairs, so we need to divide the result by 6 to account for this overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 / 6 = 15 ways to divide the 6 students into 3 pairs to share hotel rooms."
