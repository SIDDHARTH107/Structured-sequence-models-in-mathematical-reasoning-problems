    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the given system of congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. \n\nFirst, let's find the product of the moduli: N = 7 * 9 * 5 = 315.\n\nNow, we will compute the partial products:\nN1 = N/7 = 315/7 = 45\nN2 = N/9 = 315/9 = 35\nN3 = N/5 = 315/5 = 63\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverses:\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 7) = 45^(-1) (mod 7)\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 9) = 35^(-1) (mod 9)\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 5) = 63^(-1) (mod 5)\n\nBy trying out different values, we find that:\ny1 = 1 (since 45 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\ny2 = 2 (since 35 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 9))\ny3 = 3 (since 63 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\n\nNow, we can find the solution x:\nx = (3 * 45 * 1) + (4 * 35 * 2) + (2 * 63 * 3) = 135 + 280 + 378 = 793\n\nHowever, we need the smallest positive integer, so we take the result modulo N:\nx = 793 (mod 315) = 163\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the given system of congruences is 163."
