Find the velocity of the car after 2 seconds and determine whether the car is accelerating or decelerating at that moment.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the velocity function $v(t)$.\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(2t^3 - 5t^2 - 3t + 10)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 6t^2 - 10t - 3$\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity of the car after 2 seconds. We plug in $t = 2$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(2) = 6(2)^2 - 10(2) - 3 = 6(4) - 20 - 3 = 24 - 20 - 3 = 1$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car after 2 seconds is 1 meter per second.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the car is accelerating or decelerating at that moment. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function $s(t)$, which gives us the acceleration function $a(t)$.\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t^2 - 10t - 3)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 12t - 10$\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration of the car after 2 seconds. We plug in $t = 2$ into the acceleration function:\n\n$a(2) = 12(2) - 10 = 24 - 10 = 14$\n\nSince the acceleration is positive (14 m/sÂ²) at $t = 2$, the car is accelerating at that moment."
