    "message_1": "A company has 6 employees who need to be assigned to 6 different tasks. Each task requires exactly one employee. In how many ways can the company assign the employees to the tasks if no employee can be assigned to more than one task?",
    "message_2": "This is a permutation problem, as the order of the assignments matters. There are 6 employees and 6 tasks, so there are 6! (6 factorial) ways to assign the employees to the tasks.\n\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nSo, there are 720 ways to assign the employees to the tasks."
