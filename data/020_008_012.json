The cost of laying a fiber optic cable between any two cities is given below: \n\n|          | City 1 | City 2 | City 3 | City 4 |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| **City 1**|   0    |  $10,000$  | $20,000$   | $30,000$   |\n| **City 2**|  $10,000$  |   0    | $25,000$   | $15,000$   |\n| **City 3**|  $20,000$  | $25,000$   |   0    | $35,000$   |\n| **City 4**|  $30,000$  | $15,000$   | $35,000$   |   0    |\n\nWhat is the least expensive way to connect all four cities with high-speed internet?",
    "message_2": "To find the least expensive way to connect all four cities with high-speed internet, we can use the minimum spanning tree algorithm. In this case, we can use Kruskal's algorithm.\n\n1. Sort all the edges in ascending order of their weights.\n   - (City 1, City 2) - $10,000\n   - (City 2, City 4) - $15,000\n   - (City 1, City 3) - $20,000\n   - (City 3, City 2) - $25,000\n   - (City 1, City 4) - $30,000\n   - (City 3, City 4) - $35,000\n\n2. Start with an empty graph and add edges one by one in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge doesn't form a cycle.\n\n   - Add (City 1, City 2) - $10,000\n   - Add (City 2, City 4) - $15,000\n   - Add (City 1, City 3) - $20,000\n\n3. At this point, adding any more edges would create a cycle, so we stop.\n\nThe least expensive way to connect all four cities with high-speed internet is by connecting City 1 to City 2, City 2 to City 4, and City 1 to City 3. The total cost for this configuration is $10,000 + $15,000 + $20,000 = $45,000."
