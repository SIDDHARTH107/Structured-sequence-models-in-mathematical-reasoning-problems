    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2, we first need to find the first derivative of the function with respect to x.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 6x\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points of the function.\n\n4x^3 - 12x^2 + 6x = 0\n\nWe can factor out a 2x from the equation:\n\n2x(2x^2 - 6x + 3) = 0\n\nNow, we have two factors: 2x and (2x^2 - 6x + 3). We need to find the roots of these factors.\n\nFor the first factor, 2x = 0, we have:\n\nx = 0\n\nFor the second factor, we need to solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 6x + 3 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -6, and c = 3.\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(2)(3))) / (2(2))\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 4\nx = (6 ± √12) / 4\n\nSo, we have two more critical points:\n\nx = (6 + √12) / 4\nx = (6 - √12) / 4\n\nThus, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2 are x = 0, x = (6 + √12) / 4, and x = (6 - √12) / 4."
