    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and 7 times the first row from the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -6 \\\\\n0 & -6 & -12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & -6 & -12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 3: Add 6 times the second row to the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that there are 2 non-zero rows. Therefore, the rank of matrix A is 2."
