    "message_1": "What is the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network in a month if the network is exposed to 30 unique phishing emails per day, given that the probability of a successful ransomware attack on a single phishing email is 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. Instead of finding the probability of at least one successful ransomware attack, we will find the probability of no successful ransomware attacks and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's first find the probability of a single phishing email not leading to a successful ransomware attack:\n\nP(not successful) = 1 - P(successful) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n\nNow, let's find the probability of no successful ransomware attacks in a single day, given that the network is exposed to 30 unique phishing emails:\n\nP(no successful attacks in a day) = P(not successful)^30 ≈ 0.95^30 ≈ 0.214\n\nSince there are 30 days in a month, we can now find the probability of no successful ransomware attacks in a month:\n\nP(no successful attacks in a month) = P(no successful attacks in a day)^30 ≈ 0.214^30 ≈ 0.0000069\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least one successful ransomware attack occurring in a month:\n\nP(at least one successful attack in a month) = 1 - P(no successful attacks in a month) ≈ 1 - 0.0000069 ≈ 0.9999931\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network in a month is approximately 0.9999931 or 99.99931%."
