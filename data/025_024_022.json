    "message_2": "To determine the number of G-orbits on X, we need to find the number of distinct orbits under the action of G on the points of X. Let's first analyze the action of each element of G on a point P = [x:y:z] ∈ X.\n\n1. eP = P, since e is the identity matrix.\n2. aP = [-x:y:z], since a = diag(-1,1,1).\n3. bP = [x:-y:z], since b = diag(1,-1,1).\n4. cP = [x:y:-z], since c = diag(1,1,-1).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases for the coordinates of P:\n\nCase 1: x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0, z ≠ 0\nIn this case, all the actions of G on P give distinct points:\n- eP = [x:y:z]\n- aP = [-x:y:z]\n- bP = [x:-y:z]\n- cP = [x:y:-z]\nSince all the points are distinct, there is only one G-orbit in this case.\n\nCase 2: x = 0, y ≠ 0, z ≠ 0\nIn this case, the actions of G on P give the following points:\n- eP = [0:y:z]\n- aP = [0:y:z] (same as eP)\n- bP = [0:-y:z]\n- cP = [0:y:-z]\nThere are two distinct points, so there are two G-orbits in this case.\n\nCase 3: x ≠ 0, y = 0, z ≠ 0\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, so there are also two G-orbits in this case.\n\nCase 4: x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0, z = 0\nThis case is also symmetric to Case 2, so there are two G-orbits in this case.\n\nCase 5: x = 0, y = 0, z ≠ 0\nIn this case, the actions of G on P give the following points:\n- eP = [0:0:z]\n- aP = [0:0:z] (same as eP)\n- bP = [0:0:z] (same as eP)\n- cP = [0:0:-z]\nThere are two distinct points, so there is one G-orbit in this case.\n\nCase 6: x = 0, y ≠ 0, z = 0\nThis case is symmetric to Case 5, so there is one G-orbit in this case.\n\nCase 7: x ≠ 0, y = 0, z = 0\nThis case is also symmetric to Case 5, so there is one G-orbit in this case.\n\nNow, let's sum up the number of G-orbits in each case:\n1 (Case 1) + 2 (Case 2) + 2 (Case 3) + 2 (Case 4) + 1 (Case 5) + 1 (Case 6) + 1 (Case 7) = 10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 G-orbits on X."
