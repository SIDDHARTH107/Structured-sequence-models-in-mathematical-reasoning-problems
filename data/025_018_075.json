    "message_2": "To find the points of inflection, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the curve with respect to x. Since the equation is given implicitly, we will use implicit differentiation.\n\nGiven equation: y^2 = x^3 + x^2 - 4x\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = 3x^2 + 2x - 4\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx (first derivative):\n\ndy/dx = (3x^2 + 2x - 4) / (2y)\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, d²y/dx²:\n\nd²y/dx² = (d/dx)((3x^2 + 2x - 4) / (2y))\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\nd²y/dx² = [(2y)(6x + 2) - (3x^2 + 2x - 4)(2(dy/dx))]/(2y)^2\n\nWe already found dy/dx, so substitute it:\n\nd²y/dx² = [(2y)(6x + 2) - (3x^2 + 2x - 4)(3x^2 + 2x - 4) / (2y)]/(4y^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the points where d²y/dx² = 0, which are the potential points of inflection. However, this expression is quite complicated, and it's not easy to solve for x directly. Instead, we can look for the points where the numerator is equal to zero, as this will make the second derivative equal to zero:\n\n(2y)(6x + 2) - (3x^2 + 2x - 4)(3x^2 + 2x - 4) / (2y) = 0\n\n(6x + 2)(2y - (3x^2 + 2x - 4)) = 0\n\nThis equation has two factors, so we need to consider both cases:\n\n1) 6x + 2 = 0\nx = -1/3\n\n2) 2y - (3x^2 + 2x - 4) = 0\ny = (3x^2 + 2x - 4)/2\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding y values for the x value we found:\n\nFor x = -1/3, substitute into the original equation:\n\ny^2 = (-1/3)^3 + (-1/3)^2 - 4(-1/3)\ny^2 = 1/27 + 1/9 + 4/3\ny^2 = (1 + 3 + 36)/27\ny^2 = 40/27\n\nSo, y = ±√(40/27)\n\nThus, the points of inflection are:\n\n(-1/3, √(40/27)) and (-1/3, -√(40/27))"
