    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly three heads and three tails, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x!(n-x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (flips), x is the number of successful outcomes (heads), p is the probability of success (getting a head), and q is the probability of failure (getting a tail).\n\nIn this case, n = 6, x = 3, p = 1/2, and q = 1/2.\n\nP(3) = (6! / (3!(6-3)!)) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^(6-3)\n\nP(3) = (720 / (6*6)) * (1/8) * (1/8)\n\nP(3) = (20) * (1/64)\n\nP(3) = 20/64 = 5/16\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly three heads and three tails is 5/16 or 0.3125."
