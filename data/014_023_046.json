    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"MAAETMHSCIT\" using the rail fence cipher with 3 rails, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the length of the ciphertext, which is 11 characters.\n2. Divide the ciphertext into 3 groups, corresponding to the 3 rails. The first and last rail will have 3 characters each, and the middle rail will have 5 characters.\n3. Arrange the characters in a zigzag pattern, following the rail fence structure:\n\n   M _ _ M _ _ S\n   _ A _ E _ H _ \n   A _ T _ C _ I _ T\n\n4. Read the plaintext along the rows, from left to right and top to bottom:\n\n   M _ _ M _ _ S\n   _ A _ E _ H _ \n   A _ T _ C _ I _ T\n\nThe decrypted plaintext is \"MATHEMATICS\"."
