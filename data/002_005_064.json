    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism in centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (D) can be found using the formula:\n\nD = √(L^2 + W^2 + H^2)\n\nwhere L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nIn this case, L = 6 cm, W = 4 cm, and H = 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = √(6^2 + 4^2 + 3^2)\nD = √(36 + 16 + 9)\nD = √(61)\n\nTherefore, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √(61) cm, which is approximately 7.81 cm."
