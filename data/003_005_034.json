    "message_2": "To find the value of x in radians using the inverse trigonometric function, we use the arcsin (sin^(-1)) function:\n\nx = arcsin(0.5)\n\nx ≈ π/6 or 5π/6\n\nThere are two values for x in the interval [0, 2π] because the sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants. So, x can be π/6 (30°) or 5π/6 (150°)."
