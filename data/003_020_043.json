    "message_1": "A flagpole stands on level ground. If the angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole from a point on the ground is 30 degrees and the distance from the point to the base of the flagpole is 20 meters, how tall is the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the flagpole) and the adjacent side (distance from the point to the base of the flagpole) in a right triangle.\n\nLet h be the height of the flagpole. We have:\n\ntan(30°) = h / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation and solve for h:\n\nh = 20 * tan(30°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nSo,\n\nh ≈ 20 * 0.577\nh ≈ 11.54 meters\n\nThe flagpole is approximately 11.54 meters tall."
