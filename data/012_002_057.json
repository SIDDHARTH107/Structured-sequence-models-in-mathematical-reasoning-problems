    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of G, we need to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nWe can start by assigning colors to the vertices one by one, using the smallest possible color that doesn't conflict with any adjacent vertices.\n\n1. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n2. Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, so assign color 2 to vertex 2.\n3. Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 1, so assign color 2 to vertex 3.\n4. Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 2, so assign color 1 to vertex 4.\n5. Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4, so assign color 3 to vertex 5.\n6. Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices 4 and 5, so assign color 2 to vertex 6.\n7. Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertices 5 and 6, so assign color 1 to vertex 7.\n8. Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertices 6 and 7, so assign color 3 to vertex 8.\n9. Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertices 7 and 8, so assign color 2 to vertex 9.\n10. Vertex 10 is adjacent to vertices 8 and 9, so assign color 1 to vertex 10.\n\nThe resulting coloring is:\n\n1. Vertex 1: color 1\n2. Vertex 2: color 2\n3. Vertex 3: color 2\n4. Vertex 4: color 1\n5. Vertex 5: color 3\n6. Vertex 6: color 2\n7. Vertex 7: color 1\n8. Vertex 8: color 3\n9. Vertex 9: color 2\n10. Vertex 10: color 1\n\nWe have used 3 colors in this coloring, and no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is 3."
