    "message_2": "First, let's consider the case where G has an element of order 20. Let a be an element of G with order 20. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by ⟨a⟩, has order 20. Since the order of ⟨a⟩ is equal to the order of G, it follows that G = ⟨a⟩. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 20, and by definition, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G does not have an element of order 20. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup P and a Sylow 2-subgroup Q, with orders 5 and 4, respectively. Since the order of P is prime, P is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5. The order of Q is 4, so Q is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V.\n\nCase 1: Q is isomorphic to C4.\nLet P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 5 and b has order 4. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, the elements of P and Q commute. Therefore, G is generated by a and b, and the group operation can be described by the following relations: a^5 = b^4 = e, and ab = ba. The group G is then isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nCase 2: Q is isomorphic to V.\nLet P = ⟨a⟩, and let Q = {e, b, c, d}, where b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = e and bc = d. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, the elements of P and Q commute. However, the elements of Q do not commute with each other. Therefore, G is generated by a, b, and c, and the group operation can be described by the following relations: a^5 = b^2 = c^2 = e, ab = ba, ac = ca, and bc = d. The group G is then isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 20, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20."
