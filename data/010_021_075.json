Let $S^2$ denote the 2-dimensional sphere with its standard symplectic structure. Prove that any symplectic embedding of $S^2$ into $M$ must necessarily intersect the image of any other symplectic embedding of $S^2$ into $M$.\n\nFind the number of symplectic embeddings of $S^2$ into $M$ up to symplectic isotopy when $M = \\mathbb{C}P^2$, the complex projective plane.",
    "message_2": "To prove that any symplectic embedding of $S^2$ into $M$ must necessarily intersect the image of any other symplectic embedding of $S^2$ into $M$, we will use the following fact:\n\nFact: If $\\iota_1, \\iota_2: S^2 \\hookrightarrow M$ are two disjoint symplectic embeddings, then\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} \\iota_1^*\\omega = \\int_{S^2} \\iota_2^*\\omega.\n$$\n\nProof: Since $\\iota_1(S^2)$ and $\\iota_2(S^2)$ are disjoint, we can find a smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f|_{\\iota_1(S^2)} = 0$ and $f|_{\\iota_2(S^2)} = 1$. Now, consider the 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms $\\phi_t: M \\to M$ generated by the Hamiltonian vector field $X_f$ associated to $f$. Then $\\phi_0 = \\text{id}$ and $\\phi_1(\\iota_1(S^2)) = \\iota_2(S^2)$. Since $\\phi_t$ is a symplectomorphism for all $t$, we have\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} \\iota_1^*\\omega = \\int_{S^2} (\\phi_1 \\circ \\iota_1)^*\\omega = \\int_{S^2} \\iota_2^*\\omega.\n$$\n\nNow, let $M = \\mathbb{C}P^2$ with its standard symplectic structure. We want to find the number of symplectic embeddings of $S^2$ into $M$ up to symplectic isotopy. Let $\\iota: S^2 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{C}P^2$ be a symplectic embedding. Then\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} \\iota^*\\omega = \\int_{S^2} \\omega_{FS},\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{FS}$ is the Fubini-Study form on $S^2$. Since $[\\omega] \\in H^2(\\mathbb{C}P^2;\\mathbb{Z})$ is a generator, we have\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} \\omega_{FS} = k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\n\nNow, let $\\iota_1, \\iota_2: S^2 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{C}P^2$ be two symplectic embeddings such that $\\iota_1(S^2)$ and $\\iota_2(S^2)$ are disjoint. Then, by the fact above, we have\n$$\nk = \\int_{S^2} \\iota_1^*\\omega = \\int_{S^2} \\iota_2^*\\omega.\n$$\n\nThis implies that any two disjoint symplectic embeddings of $S^2$ into $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ must have the same symplectic area. Since the total symplectic area of $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ is $3k$, there can be at most three disjoint symplectic embeddings of $S^2$ into $\\mathbb{C}P^2$. However, it is known that there exist three disjoint symplectic embeddings of $S^2$ into $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ (for example, the complex lines in a pencil). Therefore, there are exactly three symplectic embeddings of $S^2$ into $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ up to symplectic isotopy."
