The container should have a minimum surface area possible, in order to reduce manufacturing costs. \n\nWhat should be the dimensions (radius and height) of the container in order to optimize the design?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the surface area of the cylindrical container while maintaining a volume of 100 cubic meters, we can use the method of optimization with calculus.\n\nLet r be the radius and h be the height of the cylinder. The volume V and surface area A of the cylinder are given by the following formulas:\n\nV = πr^2h\nA = 2πr^2 + 2πrh\n\nWe are given that the volume is 100 cubic meters:\n\n100 = πr^2h\n\nWe need to express h in terms of r, so we can rewrite the surface area equation as a function of r only. From the volume equation, we have:\n\nh = 100 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h in the surface area equation:\n\nA(r) = 2πr^2 + 2πr(100 / (πr^2))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nA(r) = 2πr^2 + 200/r\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we need to find the critical points of A(r) by taking the derivative with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = 4πr - 200/r^2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\n4πr^3 - 200 = 0\nr^3 = 50/π\nr = (50/π)^(1/3)\n\nNow we need to find the height h using the expression we derived earlier:\n\nh = 100 / (π((50/π)^(1/3))^2)\n\nh = 100 / (50/π)\n\nh = 2π\n\nSo, the optimal dimensions for the cylindrical container are:\n\nRadius: r ≈ (50/π)^(1/3) meters\nHeight: h ≈ 2π meters"
