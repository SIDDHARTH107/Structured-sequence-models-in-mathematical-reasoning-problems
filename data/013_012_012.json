    "message_1": "The Stackelberg leadership model is a type of oligopoly game where one firm (the leader) sets its quantity or price first, and the other firms (the followers) then choose their optimal strategies based on the leader's decision. Here's a numerical problem:\n\nConsider two firms, A and B, competing in a homogeneous product market. The market demand function is given by Q = 100 - P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the market price. The production cost for each firm is C(Q) = Q^2/2, where C is the total cost and Q is the production quantity. Firm A acts as the leader and sets its production quantity first. Firm B observes A's decision and then decides its own production quantity.\n\nWhat production quantities should A and B choose to maximize their profits? What will be the equilibrium price and total market quantity?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction function for Firm B, which shows the optimal quantity for Firm B given Firm A's quantity. Then, we will find the optimal quantity for Firm A by maximizing its profit, taking into account Firm B's reaction function. Finally, we will find the equilibrium price and total market quantity.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for Firm B\nThe profit function for Firm B is given by:\nπ_B = P * Q_B - C(Q_B)\nSubstitute the demand function and cost function:\nπ_B = (100 - Q_A - Q_B) * Q_B - (Q_B^2 / 2)\n\nTo find the optimal quantity for Firm B, we need to take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_B and set it equal to zero:\ndπ_B / dQ_B = 100 - Q_A - 2 * Q_B - Q_B = 0\n\nSolve for Q_B:\nQ_B = (100 - Q_A) / 3\nThis is the reaction function for Firm B.\n\nStep 2: Find the optimal quantity for Firm A\nThe profit function for Firm A is given by:\nπ_A = P * Q_A - C(Q_A)\nSubstitute the demand function, cost function, and Firm B's reaction function:\nπ_A = (100 - Q_A - (100 - Q_A) / 3) * Q_A - (Q_A^2 / 2)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\nπ_A = (200 / 3 - 4 / 3 * Q_A) * Q_A - (Q_A^2 / 2)\n\nTo find the optimal quantity for Firm A, we need to take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_A and set it equal to zero:\ndπ_A / dQ_A = 200 / 3 - 8 / 3 * Q_A - Q_A = 0\n\nSolve for Q_A:\nQ_A = 20\n\nStep 3: Find the optimal quantity for Firm B\nUsing Firm B's reaction function, we can find the optimal quantity for Firm B:\nQ_B = (100 - Q_A) / 3\nQ_B = (100 - 20) / 3\nQ_B = 80 / 3 ≈ 26.67\n\nStep 4: Find the equilibrium price and total market quantity\nSubstitute the optimal quantities for Firm A and Firm B into the demand function:\nP = 100 - Q_A - Q_B\nP = 100 - 20 - 26.67\nP ≈ 53.33\n\nThe total market quantity is given by:\nQ = Q_A + Q_B\nQ = 20 + 26.67\nQ ≈ 46.67\n\nIn conclusion, Firm A should produce 20 units, Firm B should produce approximately 26.67 units, the equilibrium price will be approximately 53.33, and the total market quantity will be approximately 46.67 units."
