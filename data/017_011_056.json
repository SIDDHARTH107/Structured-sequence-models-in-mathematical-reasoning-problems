    "message_2": "The group of order 12 that represents a regular hexagon with all of its symmetries is the dihedral group D6. This group consists of the rotations and reflections of a regular hexagon. The rotations are multiples of 60 degrees (0, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 degrees), and the reflections are about the lines of symmetry passing through the vertices and the midpoints of the opposite sides.\n\nNow, let's prove that every group of order 12 is isomorphic to either D6, C12, A4, or itself.\n\nLet G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n2 divides 12 and n2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n3 divides 4 and n3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have that n2 ∈ {1, 3} and n3 ∈ {1, 4}.\n\nCase 1: n2 = 1 and n3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. The product of P2 and P3 has order 12, so G is isomorphic to the direct product of P2 and P3, which is C12.\n\nCase 2: n2 = 3 and n3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P3 of order 3, which is normal in G. G also has three Sylow 2-subgroups, which are conjugate to each other. Let P2 be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since P3 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P2 and P3. The action of P2 on P3 is either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P2 and P3, which is C12. If the action is nontrivial, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nCase 3: n2 = 1 and n3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P2 of order 4, which is normal in G. G also has four Sylow 3-subgroups, which are conjugate to each other. Let P3 be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P2 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P3 and P2. The action of P3 on P2 is either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P3 and P2, which is C12. If the action is nontrivial, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 12 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the dihedral group D6, the alternating group A4, or itself (D6)."
