    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 7^15 is divided by 13, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. We will find the powers of 7 modulo 13.\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 13)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ -3 (mod 13)\n7^3 ≡ 7 * 7^2 ≡ 7 * (-3) ≡ -21 ≡ 8 (mod 13)\n7^4 ≡ 7 * 7^3 ≡ 7 * 8 ≡ 56 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n7^5 ≡ 7 * 7^4 ≡ 7 * 3 ≡ 21 ≡ 8 (mod 13)\n\nNotice that 7^3 ≡ 8 (mod 13) and 7^5 ≡ 8 (mod 13). This means that the powers of 7 modulo 13 repeat every two powers starting from the third power. Therefore, we can write:\n\n7^15 ≡ 7^3 * 7^12 ≡ 8 * (7^2)^6 ≡ 8 * (-3)^6 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we can calculate (-3)^6 modulo 13:\n\n(-3)^2 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n(-3)^4 ≡ 9^2 ≡ 81 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n(-3)^6 ≡ (-3)^4 * (-3)^2 ≡ 3 * 9 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nFinally, we can substitute this back into our original equation:\n\n7^15 ≡ 8 * 1 (mod 13)\n7^15 ≡ 8 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^15 is divided by 13 is 8."
