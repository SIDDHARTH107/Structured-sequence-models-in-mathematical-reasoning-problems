Find the degree of X, i.e. the intersection product of r divisors in the Picard group Pic(X), each representing the class of a hyperplane section.",
    "message_2": "Since X is a Fano variety of dimension n and index r, we have that -K_X = rH for some ample divisor H. The degree of X is defined as the intersection product of r divisors in the Picard group Pic(X), each representing the class of a hyperplane section. In other words, we want to compute the intersection number (H^n).\n\nBy the definition of the index r, we have -K_X = rH. Therefore, we can rewrite the intersection number as (-K_X/r)^n = (-K_X^n)/r^n.\n\nNow, we can use the adjunction formula, which states that K_X + K_X|_H = K_H, where K_H is the canonical divisor of the hyperplane section H. Since -K_X is ample, we have K_X = -(rH), and K_X|_H = -(r-1)H|_H. Thus, K_H = -H|_H.\n\nApplying the adjunction formula again, we get K_H + K_H|_(H^2) = K_(H^2), where K_(H^2) is the canonical divisor of the intersection of two hyperplane sections. This gives us -H|_H + (-H|_H)|_(H^2) = -H|_(H^2).\n\nContinuing this process, we eventually obtain the equation -H|_(H^n) = -K_X^n. Since H is ample, the intersection number (H^n) is positive. Therefore, we have:\n\nDegree of X = (H^n) = (-K_X^n)/r^n = (-(-rH)^n)/r^n = (r^n * H^n)/r^n = H^n.\n\nThus, the degree of X is the intersection number (H^n)."
