    "message_1": "Suppose that Alice wants to send a digitally signed message to Bob using the RSA cryptosystem. Alice's private key is $(n,d) = (35,15)$, and her public key is $(n,e) = (35,3)$. The message that Alice wants to send to Bob is the number 9. \n\nWhat number will Bob receive after verifying the digital signature?",
    "message_2": "To send a digitally signed message using the RSA cryptosystem, Alice will first sign the message using her private key and then encrypt the signed message using Bob's public key. In this case, Alice and Bob are using the same public key, which is $(n, e) = (35, 3)$.\n\nFirst, Alice signs the message using her private key $(n, d) = (35, 15)$. She computes the signature as follows:\n\n$S = M^d \\mod n = 9^{15} \\mod 35$\n\nUsing modular exponentiation, we can compute this as:\n\n$S = (9^3 \\mod 35)^5 \\mod 35 = 27^5 \\mod 35$\n\nNow, we can compute $27^5 \\mod 35$ using exponentiation by squaring:\n\n$27^2 \\mod 35 = 729 \\mod 35 = 4$\n\n$27^4 \\mod 35 = 4^2 \\mod 35 = 16$\n\n$27^5 \\mod 35 = 27 \\cdot 16 \\mod 35 = 432 \\mod 35 = 2$\n\nSo, the signed message is $S = 2$.\n\nNow, Bob will verify the digital signature using Alice's public key $(n, e) = (35, 3)$. He computes the original message as follows:\n\n$M = S^e \\mod n = 2^3 \\mod 35 = 8 \\mod 35 = 8$\n\nHowever, this is not the original message that Alice wanted to send (which was 9). There seems to be an error in the given keys or the message. In a correct RSA cryptosystem setup, Bob should have received the original message after verifying the digital signature."
