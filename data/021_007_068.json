    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method for finding the roots of a real-valued function. The formula for the method is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the current approximation, f(x) is the function, and f'(x) is the derivative of the function.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 2, we first need to find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method with the initial guess x0 = 2:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\nx1 = 2 - (2^3 - 2(2^2) + 2 + 2) / (3(2^2) - 4(2) + 1)\nx1 = 2 - (8 - 8 + 2 + 2) / (12 - 8 + 1)\nx1 = 2 - (4) / (5)\nx1 = 2 - 0.8\nx1 = 1.2\n\nNow we have the first approximation x1 = 1.2. We can continue the process to get more accurate approximations, but it's important to note that the Newton-Raphson method does not guarantee convergence for all functions or initial guesses. In practice, you would typically set a tolerance level and stop iterating once the difference between successive approximations is smaller than the tolerance."
