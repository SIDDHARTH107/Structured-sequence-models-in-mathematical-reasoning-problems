    "message_1": "Suppose you want to hash a message that contains 25 characters using the SHA-256 function. What would be the output message digest in hexadecimal format?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot provide the exact output message digest for a specific message without knowing the content of the message. However, I can explain how the SHA-256 function works and what the output would look like.\n\nSHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input message of any length and produces a fixed-size output of 256 bits (32 bytes). The output is commonly represented as a 64-character hexadecimal string.\n\nTo hash a message using SHA-256, you would need to follow the algorithm's steps, which include padding the message, dividing it into blocks, and processing each block through a series of operations to produce the final hash value.\n\nIf you provide the content of the 25-character message, I can help you calculate the SHA-256 hash. Alternatively, you can use an online SHA-256 hash generator or a programming library to compute the hash for your specific message."
