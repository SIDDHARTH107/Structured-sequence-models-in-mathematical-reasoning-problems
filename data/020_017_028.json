    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the cable used to form the circle and y be the length of the cable used to form the square. We have the constraint:\n\nx + y = 10\n\nWe need to find the dimensions of the circle and square that maximize the total area enclosed by the two shapes. Let A_circle be the area of the circle and A_square be the area of the square. The total area A_total is given by:\n\nA_total = A_circle + A_square\n\nFor the circle, the circumference is given by C_circle = 2 * pi * r_circle, where r_circle is the radius of the circle. Since x is the length of the cable used to form the circle, we have:\n\nx = 2 * pi * r_circle\nr_circle = x / (2 * pi)\n\nThe area of the circle is given by A_circle = pi * r_circle^2:\n\nA_circle = pi * (x / (2 * pi))^2\nA_circle = (x^2) / (4 * pi)\n\nFor the square, the perimeter is given by P_square = 4 * s, where s is the side length of the square. Since y is the length of the cable used to form the square, we have:\n\ny = 4 * s\ns = y / 4\n\nThe area of the square is given by A_square = s^2:\n\nA_square = (y / 4)^2\nA_square = y^2 / 16\n\nNow we can express the total area A_total in terms of x and y:\n\nA_total = (x^2) / (4 * pi) + y^2 / 16\n\nSince x + y = 10, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 10 - x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for A_total:\n\nA_total = (x^2) / (4 * pi) + (10 - x)^2 / 16\n\nTo find the maximum total area, we can take the derivative of A_total with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(A_total) / dx = (2 * x) / (4 * pi) - (2 * (10 - x)) / 16 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 8 * pi / (pi + 2) ≈ 5.5394 meters\n\nNow we can find y:\n\ny = 10 - x ≈ 10 - 5.5394 ≈ 4.4606 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the circle and square that maximize the total area enclosed by the two shapes are:\n\n- Length of cable used for the circle: x ≈ 5.5394 meters\n- Length of cable used for the square: y ≈ 4.4606 meters\n- Radius of the circle: r_circle ≈ 5.5394 / (2 * pi) ≈ 0.8813 meters\n- Side length of the square: s ≈ 4.4606 / 4 ≈ 1.1152 meters"
