    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number $C \\cdot C$ of a closed curve $C$ on a compact connected orientable surface $S$ of genus $g$, we need to consider the homology classes of the curve $C$. Let $[C]$ denote the homology class of $C$ in $H_1(S; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nRecall that the intersection number of two homology classes $[A]$ and $[B]$ in $H_1(S; \\mathbb{Z})$ is given by the algebraic intersection number $[A] \\cdot [B] = \\sum_{p \\in A \\cap B} \\text{sgn}(p)$, where the sum is taken over all intersection points $p$ of representatives $A$ and $B$ of the homology classes $[A]$ and $[B]$, and $\\text{sgn}(p)$ is the sign of the intersection at $p$ (positive if the intersection is transverse and preserves orientation, negative otherwise).\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection number $C \\cdot C$. Since $C$ is a closed curve on $S$, it is possible that $C$ intersects itself at some points. Let's consider two cases:\n\n1. $C$ is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself. In this case, the intersection number $C \\cdot C = 0$, since there are no intersection points to consider.\n\n2. $C$ is not simple, i.e., it intersects itself at some points. In this case, we can perturb $C$ slightly to obtain two homologous curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ that intersect transversely and have the same homology class $[C]$. Then the intersection number $C \\cdot C = [C] \\cdot [C] = [C_1] \\cdot [C_2]$. Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect transversely, the intersection number is the sum of the signs of the intersections, which can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the specific curve $C$ and the surface $S$.\n\nIn summary, the intersection number $C \\cdot C$ of a closed curve $C$ on a compact connected orientable surface $S$ of genus $g$ depends on the homology class of $C$ and whether $C$ is simple or not. If $C$ is simple, then $C \\cdot C = 0$. If $C$ is not simple, then $C \\cdot C$ can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the specific curve $C$ and the surface $S$."
