    "message_2": "We need to find the number of sets of three distinct integers chosen from the first ten non-negative integers (0 to 9) without the number 5.\n\nThere are a total of 10 non-negative integers from 0 to 9. Since we cannot include the number 5, we are left with 9 integers to choose from (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9).\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 distinct integers from these 9 integers. This can be done using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of integers to choose from (in this case, 9), k is the number of integers to choose (in this case, 3), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!)\n= 9! / (3!6!)\n= (9 × 8 × 7 × 6!)/(3! × 6!)\n= (9 × 8 × 7)/(3 × 2 × 1)\n= 84\n\nSo, there are 84 sets of three distinct integers chosen from the first ten non-negative integers that do not contain the number 5."
