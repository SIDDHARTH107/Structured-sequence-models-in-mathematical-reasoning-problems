    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the ship's velocity relative to the water, we can break down the ship's velocity into its eastward (x-axis) and northward (y-axis) components. \n\nWe can use the trigonometric functions sine and cosine to find these components:\n\nEastward component (x-axis) = 20 m/s * cos(35°)\nNorthward component (y-axis) = 20 m/s * sin(35°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n35° * (π / 180) ≈ 0.610865 radians\n\nNow, we can find the eastward and northward components:\n\nEastward component (x-axis) ≈ 20 m/s * cos(0.610865) ≈ 16.42 m/s\nNorthward component (y-axis) ≈ 20 m/s * sin(0.610865) ≈ 11.49 m/s\n\nThe magnitude of the ship's velocity relative to the water can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nMagnitude = √(Eastward component² + Northward component²)\nMagnitude = √((16.42 m/s)² + (11.49 m/s)²) ≈ 20 m/s\n\nThe direction of the ship's velocity relative to the water can be found using the arctangent function:\n\nDirection = arctan(Northward component / Eastward component)\nDirection = arctan(11.49 m/s / 16.42 m/s) ≈ 0.610865 radians\n\nNow, we can convert the angle back to degrees:\n\nDirection ≈ 0.610865 * (180 / π) ≈ 35°\n\nSo, the magnitude and direction of the ship's velocity relative to the water are 20 m/s and 35° North of East."
