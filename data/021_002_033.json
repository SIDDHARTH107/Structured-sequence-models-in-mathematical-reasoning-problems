    "message_2": "To find the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue λ1 using the power iteration method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial vector x(0) = [1 0 0]ᵀ\n2. Iterate the following process for k = 1, 2, 3, 4:\n   a. Compute x(k) = A * x(k-1)\n   b. Normalize x(k) by dividing each element by the largest element in x(k)\n\nSince we don't have the matrix A, we cannot perform the power iteration method directly. However, we can provide the general steps to be followed if the matrix A was given.\n\nGiven the matrix A, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial vector x(0) = [1 0 0]ᵀ\n\n2. Compute x(1) = A * x(0)\n   Normalize x(1)\n\n3. Compute x(2) = A * x(1)\n   Normalize x(2)\n\n4. Compute x(3) = A * x(2)\n   Normalize x(3)\n\n5. Compute x(4) = A * x(3)\n   Normalize x(4)\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the normalized x(4) will be an approximation of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue λ1."
