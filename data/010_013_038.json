Show that the Euler characteristic of $E$ is given by $\\chi(E) = d \\cdot \\chi(M)$, where $\\chi(M)$ denotes the Euler characteristic of $M$. \n\nNow, suppose that $M$ is a closed surface of genus $g$, and let $E$ be a rank 2 vector bundle over $M$ with degree $d$. If we know that $\\chi(E) = 0$, what can we say about the possible values of $d$?",
    "message_2": "To show that the Euler characteristic of $E$ is given by $\\chi(E) = d \\cdot \\chi(M)$, we will use the fact that the Euler characteristic is multiplicative under direct products. Let $F$ be the fiber of the vector bundle $E$ over $M$. Then, we have the following direct product decomposition:\n\n$E \\cong M \\times F$\n\nSince $E$ has rank $k$, the fiber $F$ is a $k$-dimensional vector space. The Euler characteristic of a vector space of dimension $k$ is given by $\\chi(F) = 1 + (-1)^k$. Now, we can compute the Euler characteristic of $E$ using the multiplicativity property:\n\n$\\chi(E) = \\chi(M \\times F) = \\chi(M) \\cdot \\chi(F) = \\chi(M) \\cdot (1 + (-1)^k)$\n\nSince the degree of the vector bundle $E$ is $d$, we have $d = 1 + (-1)^k$. Therefore, we can write the Euler characteristic of $E$ as:\n\n$\\chi(E) = d \\cdot \\chi(M)$\n\nNow, let $M$ be a closed surface of genus $g$, and let $E$ be a rank 2 vector bundle over $M$ with degree $d$. We are given that $\\chi(E) = 0$. Using the formula we derived above, we have:\n\n$0 = d \\cdot \\chi(M)$\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a closed surface of genus $g$ is given by $\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g$. Thus, we have:\n\n$0 = d \\cdot (2 - 2g)$\n\nThis implies that either $d = 0$ or $2 - 2g = 0$. Since $g$ is a non-negative integer, the latter equation implies that $g = 1$, which corresponds to a torus. In this case, any value of $d$ will satisfy the equation. If $g \\neq 1$, then we must have $d = 0$. \n\nIn summary, if $\\chi(E) = 0$, then either $d = 0$ or $M$ is a torus, in which case any value of $d$ is possible."
