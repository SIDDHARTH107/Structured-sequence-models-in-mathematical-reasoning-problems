    "message_1": "A prisoner's dilemma game is played between two players, player A and player B. Each player has a choice to either cooperate with the other player or defect. If both players cooperate, they each receive a payoff of 5. If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives a payoff of 8, and the cooperator receives a payoff of 0. If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of 1.\n\nWhat would be the best strategy for player A if player B is guaranteed to defect? What is the expected payoff for player A if they choose this strategy?",
    "message_2": "If player B is guaranteed to defect, the best strategy for player A would be to also defect. This is because if player A chooses to cooperate while player B defects, player A would receive a payoff of 0. However, if player A defects along with player B, player A would receive a payoff of 1.\n\nSo, the best strategy for player A is to defect, and the expected payoff for player A if they choose this strategy is 1."
