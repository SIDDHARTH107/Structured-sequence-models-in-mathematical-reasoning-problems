    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form. We can represent the coefficients of the variables in a matrix A and the constants in a matrix B:\n\nA = | 2  1 |      B = | 3 |\n    | 4  2 |          | 6 |\n\nNow, we can write the augmented matrix [A|B]:\n\n| 2  1 | 3 |\n| 4  2 | 6 |\n\nNext, we'll use the Gauss-Jordan elimination method to find the solution to the system.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  0.5 | 1.5 |\n| 4  2   | 6   |\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row to eliminate the leading 4 in the second row:\n\n| 1  0.5 | 1.5          | 1  0.5 | 1.5 |\n| 0  0   | 0   (R2 - 4R1) | 0  0   | 0   |\n\nNow, we have reached the reduced row echelon form of the matrix. However, we can see that the second row represents the equation 0x + 0y = 0, which is a true statement, but it doesn't provide any new information about the variables x and y.\n\nThis means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and the solution set can be represented as:\n\nx = 3 - y\ny = y\n\nwhere y can be any real number."
