    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal curve that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\nLength = 1 * 32\nLength = 32 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 32 units."
