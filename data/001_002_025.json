    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line that passes through the points (2, 5) and (7, -3), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (2, 5) and (7, -3), we have:\n\nm = (-3 - 5) / (7 - 2)\nm = (-8) / (5)\nm = -8/5\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either point to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (2, 5):\n\ny - 5 = -8/5(x - 2)\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n5(y - 5) = -8(x - 2)\n\nNow, distribute the 5 and -8:\n\n5y - 25 = -8x + 16\n\nNext, let's move all the terms to one side to get the equation in standard form:\n\n8x + 5y - 25 - 16 = 0\n\n8x + 5y - 41 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the line that passes through the points (2, 5) and (7, -3) is:\n\n8x + 5y - 41 = 0"
