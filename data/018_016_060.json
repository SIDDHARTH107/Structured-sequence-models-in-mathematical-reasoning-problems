    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. Find the following sets, R and S, such that R is the union of the Cartesian product of A and B, and S is the union of the Cartesian product of B and A. Then, show that R and S are not equal, thus proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products of A and B, and B and A.\n\nThe Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, A x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\nThe Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A, is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A. So, B x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}.\n\nNow, let's find the sets R and S.\n\nR is the union of the Cartesian product of A and B. Since A x B is already a single set, R is just equal to A x B. So, R = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\nS is the union of the Cartesian product of B and A. Similarly, since B x A is already a single set, S is just equal to B x A. So, S = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}.\n\nNow, let's compare R and S to see if they are equal.\n\nR = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nS = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, R and S are not equal because the ordered pairs in R are not the same as the ordered pairs in S. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union."
