    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products A and B, each of which requires the use of machines X and Y. The company has a total of 20 machine X hours and 10 machine Y hours available each day. Product A requires 2 machine X hours and 1 machine Y hour, whereas product B requires 1 machine X hour and 3 machine Y hours. If the company earns a profit of 5$ on each unit of product A and 4$ on each unit of product B, how many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal combination of products A and B that the company should produce, given the constraints on machine hours. We can use linear programming to solve this problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 5x + 4y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2x + y ≤ 20 (machine X hours)\n2. x + 3y ≤ 10 (machine Y hours)\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ -2x + 20\n2. y ≤ -(1/3)x + 10/3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect. We'll find these vertices by solving the systems of equations:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n2x + y = 20\nx + 3y = 10\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 2 and y = 8/3.\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 0 = 20\nx = 10\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + 3y = 10\ny = 10/3\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(2, 8/3) = 5(2) + 4(8/3) = 10 + 32/3 = 62/3 ≈ 20.67\n2. P(10, 0) = 5(10) + 4(0) = 50\n3. P(0, 10/3) = 5(0) + 4(10/3) = 40/3 ≈ 13.33\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (10, 0), with a profit of 50$. Therefore, the company should produce 10 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize the profit."
