    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 11 |\n| 3  4  5 | 14 |\n| 4  5  6 | 17 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element of the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we can subtract 1.5 times the first row from the second row and 2 times the first row from the third row.\n\n|  2   3   4 | 11 |\n|  0  -0.5 -1 | -2.5 |\n|  0  -1  -2 | -5 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element of the third row.\nTo do this, we can subtract 2 times the second row from the third row.\n\n|  2   3    4 |  11  |\n|  0  -0.5  -1 | -2.5 |\n|  0   0    0 |  0   |\n\nNow, we have reached a row of all zeros in the last row, which means the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions. We can't find unique values for x, y, and z.\n\nTo comment on whether the given system is ill-conditioned or not, we need to calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix.\n\n| 2  3  4 |\n| 3  4  5 |\n| 4  5  6 |\n\nDeterminant = 2((4*6)-(5*5)) - 3((3*6)-(4*5)) + 4((3*5)-(4*4))\nDeterminant = 2(24-25) - 3(18-20) + 4(15-16)\nDeterminant = 2(-1) + 3(-2) + 4(-1)\nDeterminant = -2 - 6 - 4\nDeterminant = -12\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the system is not ill-conditioned. However, it is a dependent system with infinitely many solutions, so we cannot find unique values for x, y, and z."
