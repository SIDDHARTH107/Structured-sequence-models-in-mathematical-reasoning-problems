    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 3 units of raw material and 4 units of machine time, while the production of Product B requires 2 units of raw material and 5 units of machine time. The company has 240 units of raw material and 480 units of machine time available per day. The profit per unit of Product A is $10 and the profit per unit of Product B is $12. \n\nUsing simulated annealing method, find the optimal daily production quantity of Product A and Product B that will maximize the profit of the company.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we will first set up the objective function and constraints. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective function to maximize is the total profit:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 240 (raw material constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 480 (machine time constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we will implement the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the temperature T and set the initial solution (x, y) randomly.\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution (x', y') by slightly perturbing the current solution (x, y).\n3. Calculate the change in profit ΔP = P(x', y') - P(x, y).\n4. If ΔP > 0, accept the new solution (x', y'). If ΔP < 0, accept the new solution with probability exp(ΔP/T).\n5. Decrease the temperature T according to a cooling schedule.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the temperature is sufficiently low or a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain an approximate optimal solution for the daily production quantities of Product A and Product B that maximize the profit of the company.\n\nNote that the simulated annealing method is a heuristic optimization algorithm, and the solution obtained may not be the exact optimal solution. However, it is often effective in finding good solutions for complex optimization problems."
