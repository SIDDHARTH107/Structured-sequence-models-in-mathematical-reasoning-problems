    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle. A connected graph with 10 vertices and 14 edges must have at least one cycle, as the maximum number of edges in a tree (a connected graph with no cycles) with 10 vertices is 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\nTo find the minimum girth, we can try to construct a graph with the smallest possible cycle. We can start with a cycle of length 3 (a triangle) and then add vertices and edges while trying to maintain the smallest possible cycle.\n\n1. Start with a triangle (3 vertices, 3 edges, girth = 3).\n2. Add a vertex connected to two vertices of the triangle (4 vertices, 5 edges, girth = 3).\n3. Add another vertex connected to two vertices of the triangle (5 vertices, 7 edges, girth = 3).\n4. Add another vertex connected to two vertices of the triangle (6 vertices, 9 edges, girth = 3).\n5. Add another vertex connected to two vertices of the triangle (7 vertices, 11 edges, girth = 3).\n6. Add another vertex connected to two vertices of the triangle (8 vertices, 13 edges, girth = 3).\n7. Add one more edge between two non-adjacent vertices (8 vertices, 14 edges, girth = 3).\n\nThus, the minimum girth of a connected graph with 10 vertices and 14 edges is 3."
