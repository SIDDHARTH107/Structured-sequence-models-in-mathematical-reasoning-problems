    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function $f(z) = \\frac{z}{(z-1)^2}$ in the annulus $0 < |z| < 1$, we can use the geometric series formula. First, we rewrite the function as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z}{(1 - (1-z))^2} = z(1 - (1-z))^{-2} = z(1-z)^{-2}$$\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula for the function $(1-z)^{-2}$:\n\n$$(1-z)^{-2} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n+1)z^n$$\n\nThis series converges for $|z| < 1$. Therefore, the Laurent series expansion for $f(z)$ in the annulus $0 < |z| < 1$ is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = z \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n+1)z^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n+1)z^{n+1}$$\n\nThe radius of convergence of this series is 1, as the series converges for $|z| < 1$."
