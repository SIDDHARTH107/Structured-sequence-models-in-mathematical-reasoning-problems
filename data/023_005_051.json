    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation:\n\nFourier{y''(t) + 4y(t)} = Fourier{-6sin(t)}\n\nLet Y(w) be the Fourier transform of y(t). Then, using the properties of the Fourier transform, we have:\n\n(-w^2 + 4)Y(w) = -6/(w^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we solve for Y(w):\n\nY(w) = 6/(w^2 + 1)^2\n\nNext, we take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(w) to find y(t):\n\ny(t) = InverseFourier{6/(w^2 + 1)^2}\n\nUsing the convolution theorem and the fact that the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(w^2 + 1) is (1/2)exp(-|t|), we can write the inverse Fourier transform as a convolution:\n\ny(t) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (exp(-|t|) * exp(-|t|))\n\nPerforming the convolution, we get:\n\ny(t) = (1/4) * (exp(-t) * (t + 1) + exp(t) * (1 - t))\n\nSo, the final expression for the solution is:\n\ny(t) = (1/4) * (exp(-t) * (t + 1) + exp(t) * (1 - t))"
