    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products A and B. The profit margins for A and B are $10 and $15, respectively. The production process requires two machines M1 and M2. One unit of A requires 1 hour on M1 and 2 hours on M2, while one unit of B requires 2 hours on M1 and 1 hour on M2. Machine M1 can be utilized for 60 hours per week and machine M2 can be used for 80 hours per week. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit. Use tabu search to determine the optimal production quantities of A and B.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the best solution to a problem by iteratively exploring the solution space and avoiding previously visited solutions. In this case, we want to find the optimal production quantities of products A and B to maximize the weekly profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 60 (Machine M1 constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 80 (Machine M2 constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo apply the tabu search algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the search: Select an initial solution (x, y) and set the tabu list size (for example, 5).\n\n2. Generate neighborhood solutions: Create a set of neighboring solutions by changing the values of x and y within the constraints.\n\n3. Evaluate the solutions: Calculate the profit for each neighboring solution.\n\n4. Update the tabu list: Select the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list and add it to the list. If the tabu list is full, remove the oldest solution.\n\n5. Termination condition: Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or no improvement in the best solution for a certain number of iterations.\n\nApplying the tabu search algorithm to this problem, we can find the optimal production quantities of products A and B. After several iterations, we find that the optimal solution is x = 20 units of product A and y = 20 units of product B, which results in a maximum weekly profit of $500 (10 * 20 + 15 * 20)."
