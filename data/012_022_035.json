We know that R(3,3) = 6, which means that any graph with 6 vertices will contain either a triangle or an independent set of order 3. However, this doesn't guarantee the existence of an independent set of order 4.\n\nNow, let's check if R(3,4) = 7. We'll use the Pigeonhole Principle to prove this. Consider a graph with 7 vertices, and pick any vertex v. There are 6 other vertices, and each of them is either connected to v by an edge (forming a \"red\" edge) or not connected to v (forming a \"blue\" edge). By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least ⌈6/2⌉ = 3 vertices that are either all connected to v (forming red edges) or not connected to v (forming blue edges).\n\nIf there are 3 vertices connected to v by red edges, then either they are pairwise connected (forming a red triangle with v), or there is an independent set of order 3 among them (forming a blue edge). In the latter case, this independent set together with v forms an independent set of order 4.\n\nIf there are 3 vertices not connected to v by edges (forming blue edges), then either they are pairwise not connected (forming an independent set of order 4), or there is a pair of vertices among them that are connected (forming a red edge). In the latter case, this pair of vertices together with v forms a red triangle.\n\nIn either case, we have shown that any graph with 7 vertices must contain either a red triangle (a clique of order 3) or an independent set of order 4. Therefore, R(3,4) = R(4,3) = 7."
