    "message_1": "A car rental company charges a base rate of $30 per day plus an additional mileage charge of $0.50 per mile. What distance should a customer drive each day to minimize their rental cost if the limit is set to 100 miles per day? Use the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm to find the minimum cost.",
    "message_2": "To use the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, which represents the rental cost. The objective function is:\n\nCost(x) = 30 + 0.5x\n\nwhere x is the number of miles driven per day.\n\nNow, let's implement the GWO algorithm to find the minimum cost:\n\n1. Initialize the wolf population: Generate random solutions (positions) for each wolf in the search space (0 to 100 miles).\n\n2. Calculate the fitness of each wolf using the objective function.\n\n3. Identify the three best wolves (alpha, beta, and delta) based on their fitness values.\n\n4. Update the positions of the wolves using the following equations:\n\nX_new = X_old - A * D\n\nwhere A and D are calculated as:\n\nA = 2 * a * r1 - a\nD = 2 * r2\n\nHere, a is a linearly decreasing parameter from 2 to 0, and r1 and r2 are random numbers between 0 and 1.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for a certain number of iterations or until the convergence criterion is met.\n\n6. The position of the alpha wolf represents the minimum cost solution.\n\nAfter implementing the GWO algorithm, we can find the optimal distance to minimize the rental cost. Since the cost function is linear, the minimum cost will be achieved when the customer drives the least number of miles, which is 0 miles per day. In this case, the rental cost will be $30 per day."
