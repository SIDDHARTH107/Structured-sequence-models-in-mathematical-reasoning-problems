    "message_1": "A student wants to buy a new calculator. They have a budget of $50 and have found two options: Option A costs $30 but has a 20% chance of failing within the first year, while Option B costs $45 but only has a 10% chance of failing within the first year. Using decision theory, which option should the student choose?",
    "message_2": "To use decision theory, we need to calculate the expected utility of each option. Expected utility is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its utility and then summing the results.\n\nFor Option A:\n- If the calculator doesn't fail (80% chance), the student spends $30 and has $20 left.\n- If the calculator fails (20% chance), the student spends $30 and has to buy a new one, leaving them with less than $20.\n\nExpected utility for Option A = (0.8 * $20) + (0.2 * x), where x is the amount left after buying a new calculator if it fails.\n\nFor Option B:\n- If the calculator doesn't fail (90% chance), the student spends $45 and has $5 left.\n- If the calculator fails (10% chance), the student spends $45 and has to buy a new one, leaving them with less than $5.\n\nExpected utility for Option B = (0.9 * $5) + (0.1 * y), where y is the amount left after buying a new calculator if it fails.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected utilities:\n\nExpected utility for Option A = (0.8 * $20) + (0.2 * x) = $16 + 0.2x\nExpected utility for Option B = (0.9 * $5) + (0.1 * y) = $4.5 + 0.1y\n\nSince we don't know the exact cost of a new calculator if the current one fails, we can compare the expected utilities without considering the costs of buying a new calculator (x and y).\n\n$16 + 0.2x > $4.5 + 0.1y\n$11.5 > 0.1y - 0.2x\n\nAs long as the inequality holds true, Option A has a higher expected utility. In this case, it seems that Option A is the better choice for the student, as it leaves them with more money on average, even considering the higher failure rate. However, the student should also consider factors such as the cost of a new calculator if the current one fails and the inconvenience of dealing with a failed calculator."
