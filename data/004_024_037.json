    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx, we will first differentiate the given equation implicitly with respect to x. \n\nGiven equation: x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 6y + 8 = 0\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (y^2) - d/dx (4x) - d/dx (6y) + d/dx (8) = d/dx (0)\n\nUsing the chain rule for differentiating y^2 and 6y with respect to x:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) - 4 - 6(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 1. Substitute x = 1 in the given equation:\n\n(1)^2 + y^2 - 4(1) - 6y + 8 = 0\n\n1 + y^2 - 4 - 6y + 8 = 0\n\ny^2 - 6y + 5 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n(y - 5)(y - 1) = 0\n\nSo, y = 5 or y = 1\n\nNow, we will find the value of dy/dx for both values of y when x = 1.\n\nFor y = 5:\n\n2(1) + 2(5)(dy/dx) - 4 - 6(dy/dx) = 0\n\n2 + 10(dy/dx) - 4 - 6(dy/dx) = 0\n\n4(dy/dx) = 2\n\ndy/dx = 1/2\n\nFor y = 1:\n\n2(1) + 2(1)(dy/dx) - 4 - 6(dy/dx) = 0\n\n2 + 2(dy/dx) - 4 - 6(dy/dx) = 0\n\n-4(dy/dx) = 2\n\ndy/dx = -1/2\n\nSo, there are two possible values for dy/dx when x = 1: dy/dx = 1/2 and dy/dx = -1/2."
