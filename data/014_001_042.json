Using these values, determine the public and private keys for RSA encryption and decryption. Use the public key to encrypt the message '15'. Finally, use the private key to decrypt the encrypted message.",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the modulus (n) and Euler's totient function (ø) for the given prime numbers p and q.\n\n1. Calculate the modulus (n):\nn = p * q\nn = 17 * 11\nn = 187\n\n2. Calculate Euler's totient function (ø):\nø(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\nø(187) = (17 - 1) * (11 - 1)\nø(187) = 16 * 10\nø(187) = 160\n\nNow, let's determine the public and private keys for RSA encryption and decryption.\n\n3. Choose a public key exponent (e) such that 1 < e < ø(n) and gcd(e, ø(n)) = 1.\nLet's choose e = 3, which satisfies the conditions.\n\n4. Calculate the private key exponent (d) such that (d * e) % ø(n) = 1.\nWe need to find a value for d such that (3 * d) % 160 = 1.\n\nBy trying different values, we find that d = 107 satisfies this condition:\n(3 * 107) % 160 = 321 % 160 = 1\n\nSo, the public key is (n, e) = (187, 3), and the private key is (n, d) = (187, 107).\n\nNow, let's use the public key to encrypt the message '15'.\n\n5. Encrypt the message using the public key:\nEncrypted message = (message ^ e) % n\nEncrypted message = (15 ^ 3) % 187\nEncrypted message = 3375 % 187\nEncrypted message = 166\n\nFinally, let's use the private key to decrypt the encrypted message.\n\n6. Decrypt the encrypted message using the private key:\nDecrypted message = (encrypted message ^ d) % n\nDecrypted message = (166 ^ 107) % 187\nDecrypted message = 15\n\nSo, the original message is successfully decrypted as '15'."
