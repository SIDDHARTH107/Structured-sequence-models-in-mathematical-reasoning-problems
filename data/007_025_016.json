    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the public key of the first party (A): A = g^a mod p\n2. Calculate the public key of the second party (B): B = g^b mod p\n3. Calculate the shared secret key using the public and private keys: \n   - First party calculates: S = B^a mod p\n   - Second party calculates: S = A^b mod p\n\nLet's calculate the public keys of both parties:\n\n1. A = 3^5 mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 15\n2. B = 3^11 mod 17 = 177147 mod 17 = 6\n\nNow, let's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n- First party: S = 6^5 mod 17 = 7776 mod 17 = 10\n- Second party: S = 15^11 mod 17 = 437893890380859375 mod 17 = 10\n\nThe shared secret key between the two parties is 10."
