Let u = e^(-2x) and dv = cos(kx) dx. Then, du = -2e^(-2x) dx and v = (1/k)sin(kx).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nF(k) = 2 * [(e^(-2x) * (1/k)sin(kx)) - ∫(1/k)sin(kx) * -2e^(-2x) dx] from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, let's evaluate the first term at the limits:\n\nlim(x->∞) [e^(-2x) * (1/k)sin(kx)] = 0 (since e^(-2x) goes to 0 as x goes to infinity)\n\n[e^(-2(0)) * (1/k)sin(k(0))] = 0 (since sin(0) = 0)\n\nSo, the first term is 0. Now, let's focus on the second term:\n\n-2/k * ∫[sin(kx) * e^(-2x)] dx from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, we need to integrate by parts again. Let u = sin(kx) and dv = e^(-2x) dx. Then, du = kcos(kx) dx and v = -1/2 * e^(-2x).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\n-2/k * [(-1/2 * e^(-2x) * sin(kx)) - ∫(-1/2 * e^(-2x) * kcos(kx) dx)] from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, let's evaluate the first term at the limits:\n\nlim(x->∞) [-1/2 * e^(-2x) * sin(kx)] = 0 (since e^(-2x) goes to 0 as x goes to infinity)\n\n[-1/2 * e^(-2(0)) * sin(k(0))] = 0 (since sin(0) = 0)\n\nSo, the first term is 0. Now, let's focus on the second term:\n\n(2/k) * (1/2) * k * ∫[e^(-2x) * cos(kx)] dx from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, we have the same integral as we started with:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-2x) * cos(kx)] dx from 0 to +∞\n\nThis is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using the method of successive integration by parts. After two iterations, we get the same integral back. Now, we can solve for F(k):\n\nF(k) = (1 - 1) * ∫[e^(-2x) * cos(kx)] dx from 0 to +∞\n\n0 = ∫[e^(-2x) * cos(kx)] dx from 0 to +∞ - F(k)\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-2x) * cos(kx)] dx from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, we can use the Laplace transform table to find the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = 2 * (1 / (2^2 + k^2))\n\nF(k) = 2 / (4 + k^2)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-2|x|) is F(k) = 2 / (4 + k^2)."
