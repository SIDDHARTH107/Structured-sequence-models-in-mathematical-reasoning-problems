    "message_2": "The Julia set is a fractal that is defined by the same recurrence relation as the Mandelbrot set, but with a fixed complex number C. In this case, we are given C = -0.75 + 0.12i. To find the Julia set associated with this value of C, we will iterate the recurrence relation for different initial complex values of Z(0).\n\nThe Julia set is the set of all complex numbers Z(0) for which the sequence Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C remains bounded. In other words, the magnitude of Z(n) does not go to infinity as n goes to infinity.\n\nTo determine whether a particular complex number Z(0) belongs to the Julia set, we can iterate the recurrence relation a large number of times (e.g., 1000 iterations) and check if the magnitude of Z(n) remains bounded. If it does, then Z(0) is in the Julia set; otherwise, it is not.\n\nTo visualize the Julia set, we can create a 2D grid of complex numbers and color each point according to whether it belongs to the Julia set or not. Typically, points in the Julia set are colored black, and points not in the Julia set are colored according to how quickly their magnitude diverges.\n\nIt is important to note that finding the exact Julia set is computationally intensive, and the result is often an approximation. There are various algorithms and optimizations that can be used to speed up the process, but the basic idea remains the same: iterate the recurrence relation for each complex number Z(0) and check if the sequence remains bounded.\n\nIn summary, to find the Julia set associated with C = -0.75 + 0.12i, iterate the recurrence relation Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C for different initial complex values of Z(0) and check if the sequence remains bounded. The Julia set is the set of all complex numbers Z(0) for which the sequence remains bounded."
