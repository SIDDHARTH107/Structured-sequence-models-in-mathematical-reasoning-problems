    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x!(n-x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, 25 voters supporting candidate X)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 70 registered voters)\n- x is the number of desired successes (in this case, 25 voters supporting candidate X)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 40% or 0.4)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, 60% or 0.6)\n- ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(25) = (70! / (25!(70-25)!)) * (0.4^25) * (0.6^(70-25))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the binomial coefficient (70! / (25!(70-25)!)):\n\n70! = 70 * 69 * 68 * ... * 3 * 2 * 1\n25! = 25 * 24 * ... * 3 * 2 * 1\n45! = 45 * 44 * ... * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorials and the binomial coefficient:\n\n(70! / (25! * 45!)) ≈ 3,682,913,335\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.4^25) * (0.6^45):\n\n(0.4^25) ≈ 0.00000009049\n(0.6^45) ≈ 0.000001872\n\nMultiplying these probabilities:\n\n0.00000009049 * 0.000001872 ≈ 0.000000000169\n\nFinally, multiply the binomial coefficient by the probability:\n\n3,682,913,335 * 0.000000000169 ≈ 0.622\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 25 out of 70 registered voters will vote for candidate X is approximately 0.622 or 62.2%."
