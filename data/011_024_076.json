Determine the minimum number of trips that the company must make to transport all the product from A to B.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of trips needed to transport all 1200 units of product, we can divide the total number of units by the maximum capacity of each route:\n\n1200 units / 400 units per trip = 3 trips\n\nSo, the company must make a minimum of 3 trips to transport all the product from factory A to factory B."
