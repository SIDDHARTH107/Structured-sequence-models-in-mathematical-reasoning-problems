Since n is not an integer, we need to rewrite the function to have an integer order pole. We can do this by making a substitution:\n\nLet w = (z-2), then z = w+2 and f(z) = (w+3)/(w)^(3/2).\n\nNow, we have a function with a pole of order n = 3 at w = 0. We can apply the residue formula:\n\nRes[f(w), w = 0] = (1/(3-1)!) * Lim[w->0] (d^(3-1)/dw^(3-1))((w)^3 * f(w))\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of (w^3 * f(w)):\n\n(w^3 * f(w)) = (w^3 * (w+3)/(w)^(3/2)) = (w^3 * (w+3)) / (w^3)^(1/2) = (w+3) * w^(3/2)\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative:\n\nd^2/dw^2 (w+3) * w^(3/2) = d^2/dw^2 (w^(5/2) + 3w^(3/2))\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\nd^2/dw^2 (w^(5/2) + 3w^(3/2)) = (15/4)w^(1/2) + (9/2)w^(-1/2)\n\nNow, we can find the limit as w approaches 0:\n\nLim[w->0] (15/4)w^(1/2) + (9/2)w^(-1/2) = 0 + âˆž\n\nThe limit does not exist, which means the residue of the original function f(z) at z=2 is not defined."
