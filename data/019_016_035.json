    "message_2": "First, we find the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B). Since set A contains only odd numbers and set B contains only even numbers, there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, A ∩ B = {} (the empty set).\n\nNow, we find the union of (A ∩ B) and A. Since (A ∩ B) is the empty set, the union of the two sets will simply be set A itself.\n\nSo, (A ∩ B) ∪ A = A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}."
