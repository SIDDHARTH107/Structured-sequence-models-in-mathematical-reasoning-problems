    "message_2": "To prove Goldbach's conjecture for the even number 50, we need to find two prime numbers that add up to 50. \n\nLet's try some combinations of prime numbers:\n\n1. 3 + 47 = 50\n2. 7 + 43 = 50\n3. 13 + 37 = 50\n4. 19 + 31 = 50\n\nWe found four different combinations of prime numbers that add up to 50. Therefore, Goldbach's conjecture holds true for the even number 50."
