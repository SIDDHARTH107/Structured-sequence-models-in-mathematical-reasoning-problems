    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2^(3x-1) = 16, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation with the same base on both sides. Since 16 can be written as 2^4, the equation becomes:\n\n2^(3x-1) = 2^4\n\n2. Since the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n3x - 1 = 4\n\n3. Solve for x:\n\n3x = 4 + 1\n3x = 5\nx = 5/3\n\nSo, the value of x is 5/3."
