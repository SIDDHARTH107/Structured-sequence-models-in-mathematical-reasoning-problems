    "message_2": "To prove that the number of elements in S is even, we will use the concept of \"pairing\" elements in S. We will show that the elements of S can be paired up such that each element is paired with its image under the function f.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary element a in S. Since f is a function from S to S, f(a) is also an element in S. Now, applying the function f again, we have f(f(a)) = a. This means that applying the function f twice brings us back to the original element a.\n\nNow, let's pair up the elements a and f(a) for each a in S. Notice that each element in S will be paired with exactly one other element, its image under the function f. This is because if f(a) = f(b) for some a and b in S, then applying f again, we have f(f(a)) = f(f(b)), which implies a = b. So, the pairing is unique.\n\nSince each element in S is paired with exactly one other element, the number of elements in S must be even (as they can be divided into pairs). Therefore, we have shown that the number of elements in S is even."
