    "message_2": "Let's consider the properties of a group of prime order p. Since p is prime, the only divisors of p are 1 and p itself. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, a group of prime order p can only have two subgroups: the trivial subgroup {e} of order 1 and the group G itself.\n\nHowever, we are given that G has exactly 5 distinct subgroups. This means that G cannot be a simple group of prime order p. Instead, G must be a group of order p^n for some integer n > 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of subgroups in a group of order p^n. By the Sylow theorems, the number of subgroups of order p^i, where 0 ≤ i ≤ n, is equal to 1 mod p and divides p^(n-i). Since we are given that G has exactly 5 distinct subgroups, we can write the total number of subgroups as:\n\n1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^n = 5\n\nWe know that p is a prime number, and the smallest prime number is 2. Let's test if p = 2 satisfies the equation:\n\n1 + 2 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\nThis does not equal 5, so p cannot be 2. The next smallest prime number is 3. Let's test if p = 3 satisfies the equation:\n\n1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nThis also does not equal 5. The next smallest prime number is 5. Let's test if p = 5 satisfies the equation:\n\n1 + 5 = 6\n\nThis does not equal 5, but we can try adding another term:\n\n1 + 5 + 5^2 = 1 + 5 + 25 = 31\n\nThis also does not equal 5. However, we can try adding another term:\n\n1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 5 + 25 + 125 = 156\n\nThis still does not equal 5. At this point, we can see that as we increase the value of p, the sum of the series will only get larger. Therefore, there is no prime number p for which a group G of order p or p^n can have exactly 5 distinct subgroups."
