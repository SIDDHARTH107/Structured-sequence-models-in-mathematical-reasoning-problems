    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x(1-x) on the interval [0, 1], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients. Since the function is defined on a finite interval, we will use the Fourier sine series representation. The general form of the Fourier sine series is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(B_n * sin(nπx))\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx, with L = 1 in our case.\n\nFirst, let's find the B_n coefficients:\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫[x(1-x) * sin(nπx)]dx from 0 to 1\n\nTo compute this integral, we will use integration by parts twice. Let u = x(1-x) and dv = sin(nπx)dx. Then, du = (1-2x)dx and v = -(1/nπ)cos(nπx).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nB_n = 2 * [(-x(1-x)(1/nπ)cos(nπx))|_0^1 - ∫(-(1/nπ)cos(nπx)(1-2x)dx)] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, let u = (1-2x) and dv = -(1/nπ)cos(nπx)dx. Then, du = -2dx and v = (1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx).\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\nB_n = 2 * [(-x(1-x)(1/nπ)cos(nπx))|_0^1 + (1/nπ)∫(1/nπ)sin(nπx)(1-2x)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nB_n = 2 * [(-x(1-x)(1/nπ)cos(nπx))|_0^1 + (1/nπ)((1-2x)(1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx))|_0^1 - (1/nπ)∫(1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx)(-2)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integrals:\n\nB_n = 2 * [0 - 0 - (1/nπ)∫(1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx)(-2)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nB_n = (2/nπ) * ∫(1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx)(2)dx from 0 to 1\n\nB_n = (4/n^3π^3) * ∫sin(nπx)dx from 0 to 1\n\nB_n = (4/n^3π^3) * [(-1/nπ)cos(nπx)]|_0^1\n\nB_n = (4/n^4π^4) * [cos(nπ) - cos(0)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier sine series for f(x) = x(1-x):\n\nf(x) = ∑[(4/n^4π^4) * [cos(nπ) - cos(0)] * sin(nπx)]\n\nf(x) = ∑[(4/n^4π^4) * [(-1)^n - 1] * sin(nπx)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x(1-x) on the interval [0, 1]."
