A sample of 36 light bulbs was taken and it was found that the average lifespan of the sample is 780 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. Determine a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the light bulbs.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the light bulbs, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nSample Mean = 780 hours\nStandard Deviation = 50 hours\nSample Size = 36 light bulbs\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 50 / √36 = 50 / 6 = 8.333 hours\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 8.333 = 16.333 hours\n\nFinally, we can determine the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 780 ± 16.333\nLower Limit = 780 - 16.333 = 763.667 hours\nUpper Limit = 780 + 16.333 = 796.333 hours\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the light bulbs is (763.667 hours, 796.333 hours)."
