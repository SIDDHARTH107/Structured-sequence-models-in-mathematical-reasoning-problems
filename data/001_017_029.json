    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the subtraction property, which states that log_a(b) - log_a(c) = log_a(b/c). Applying this property to the given equation, we get:\n\nlog_2((x+3)/x) = 2\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by using the property a^(log_a(b)) = b. In this case, we have:\n\n2^2 = (x+3)/x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4 = (x+3)/x\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by x and then rearranging the equation:\n\n4x = x + 3\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n3x = 3\n\nFinally, dividing by 3, we find:\n\nx = 1"
