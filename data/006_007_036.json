    "message_1": "Suppose a stock is currently trading at $100 per share. If the probability of the stock price going up tomorrow is 0.6 and the probability of it going down is 0.4, what is the expected stock price at the end of the day tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected stock price at the end of the day tomorrow, we need to consider both the probability of the stock price going up and the probability of it going down. Let's assume the stock price goes up by $x and goes down by $y.\n\nExpected stock price = (Probability of stock price going up * Increase in stock price) + (Probability of stock price going down * Decrease in stock price)\n\nExpected stock price = (0.6 * $100 + x) + (0.4 * $100 - y)\n\nHowever, we don't have the values for x and y, which represent the increase and decrease in stock price. Without these values, we cannot determine the exact expected stock price at the end of the day tomorrow."
