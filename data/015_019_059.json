    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\n$H(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_1^2 + p_2^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(q_1^2 + q_2^2) + q_1^2 q_2 - \\frac{1}{3}q_2^3$\n\nwhere $q_1$, $q_2$ are the position coordinates and $p_1$, $p_2$ are the conjugate momenta. The initial conditions are given by $q_1 = 1.2$, $q_2 = 0$, $p_1 = p_2 = 0$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the initial energy of the system, which will be conserved throughout the motion:\n\n$E = H(1.2, 0, 0, 0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0^2 + 0^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(1.2^2 + 0^2) + 1.2^2 \\cdot 0 - \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0^3 = \\frac{1}{2}(1.44) = 0.72$\n\nNow, let's find the maximum kinetic and potential energies. The maximum kinetic energy occurs when the potential energy is at its minimum, and vice versa.\n\nThe potential energy is given by:\n\n$V(q_1, q_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(q_1^2 + q_2^2) + q_1^2 q_2 - \\frac{1}{3}q_2^3$\n\nTo find the extrema of the potential energy, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q_1} = q_1 + 2q_1 q_2 = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q_2} = q_2 + q_1^2 - q_2^2 = 0$\n\nSolving this system, we find two equilibrium points: $(q_1, q_2) = (0, 0)$ and $(q_1, q_2) = (1, 0)$. Evaluating the potential energy at these points, we get:\n\n$V(0, 0) = 0$\n$V(1, 0) = \\frac{1}{2}(1^2 + 0^2) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSince the energy is conserved, the maximum potential energy is equal to the total energy, which is $0.72$. Therefore, the maximum kinetic energy is:\n\n$K_{max} = E - V_{min} = 0.72 - 0 = 0.72$\n\nThe maximum potential energy occurs when the kinetic energy is at its minimum (i.e., zero). Therefore, the maximum potential energy is:\n\n$V_{max} = E - K_{min} = 0.72 - 0 = 0.72$\n\nSo, the maximum kinetic and potential energies attained by the particle are both $0.72$."
