    "message_2": "Let A be the number of students who play chess, B be the number of students who play board games, and C be the number of students who play both games. We are given:\n\nA = 20\nB = 25\nC = 15\n\nWe want to find the number of students who don't play either game. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal number of students = (Number of students who play chess) + (Number of students who play board games) - (Number of students who play both games) + (Number of students who don't play either game)\n\n40 = 20 + 25 - 15 + (Number of students who don't play either game)\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of students who don't play either game:\n\n40 = 30 + (Number of students who don't play either game)\n\n(Number of students who don't play either game) = 40 - 30\n\n(Number of students who don't play either game) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 students in the math club who don't play either game."
