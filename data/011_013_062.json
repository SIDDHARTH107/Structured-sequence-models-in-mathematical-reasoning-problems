    "message_1": "In a bag, there are 6 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 4 green balls. How many different ways can you select 7 balls from the bag if at least 3 red balls must be selected? Use Polya's enumeration theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Polya's enumeration theorem is not the most suitable method for solving this problem. Instead, we can use combinations to find the number of ways to select 7 balls with at least 3 red balls.\n\nLet's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. Selecting 3 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 2 green balls.\n2. Selecting 4 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 1 green ball.\n3. Selecting 4 red balls, 1 blue ball, and 2 green balls.\n4. Selecting 5 red balls, 1 blue ball, and 1 green ball.\n5. Selecting 6 red balls, and 1 ball of any other color.\n\nNow, we will calculate the combinations for each case:\n\n1. C(6,3) * C(5,2) * C(4,2) = 20 * 10 * 6 = 1200\n2. C(6,4) * C(5,2) * C(4,1) = 15 * 10 * 4 = 600\n3. C(6,4) * C(5,1) * C(4,2) = 15 * 5 * 6 = 450\n4. C(6,5) * C(5,1) * C(4,1) = 6 * 5 * 4 = 120\n5. C(6,6) * C(5+4,1) = 1 * 9 = 9\n\nNow, add up all the combinations from each case: 1200 + 600 + 450 + 120 + 9 = 2379\n\nSo, there are 2379 different ways to select 7 balls from the bag with at least 3 red balls."
