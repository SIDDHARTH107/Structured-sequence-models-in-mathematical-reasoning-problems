    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In other words, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. We are given that n! + 1 is divisible by 101, so we can write:\n\nn! ≡ -1 (mod 101)\n\nSince 101 is a prime number, we can apply Wilson's theorem to it. According to Wilson's theorem, (101-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 101), which means:\n\n100! ≡ -1 (mod 101)\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n! ≡ -1 (mod 101). Since 100! already satisfies this condition, the smallest positive integer n for which Wilson's theorem is satisfied is n = 100."
