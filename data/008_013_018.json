    "message_2": "First, we need to find the LU decomposition of matrix A. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination on A and keeping track of the elimination steps in a separate matrix. \n\n1. Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n    L1 = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n    A1 = [[1, 1.5, -0.5], [4, 4, -3], [-2, -2, 4]]\n\n2. Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\n    L2 = [[1, 0, 0], [-4, 1, 0], [2, 0, 1]]\n    A2 = [[1, 1.5, -0.5], [0, -2, 1], [0, 1, 3.5]]\n\n3. Divide the second row by -2 to get a leading 1:\n\n    L3 = [[1, 0, 0], [0, -0.5, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n    A3 = [[1, 1.5, -0.5], [0, 1, -0.5], [0, 1, 3.5]]\n\n4. Eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\n    L4 = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, -1, 1]]\n    A4 = [[1, 1.5, -0.5], [0, 1, -0.5], [0, 0, 4]]\n\nNow, we have the LU decomposition:\n\n    L = L1^-1 * L2^-1 * L3^-1 * L4^-1 = [[1, 0, 0], [4, 1, 0], [-2, -1, 1]]\n    U = A4 = [[1, 1.5, -0.5], [0, 1, -0.5], [0, 0, 4]]\n\nNext, we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n    L * y = b => [[1, 0, 0], [4, 1, 0], [-2, -1, 1]] * [y1, y2, y3] = [2, 8, -4]\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\n    y1 = 2\n    y2 = 8 - 4 * y1 = 0\n    y3 = -4 + 2 * y1 + y2 = 0\n\nSo, y = [2, 0, 0].\n\nFinally, we need to solve the system Ux = y for x:\n\n    U * x = y => [[1, 1.5, -0.5], [0, 1, -0.5], [0, 0, 4]] * [x1, x2, x3] = [2, 0, 0]\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\n    x3 = 0 / 4 = 0\n    x2 = (0 + 0.5 * x3) / 1 = 0\n    x1 = (2 - 1.5 * x2 + 0.5 * x3) / 1 = 2\n\nSo, x = [2, 0, 0].\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 0, and z = 0."
