    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the Sylow theorems state the following:\n\n1. For a prime p, if p^k divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^k.\n2. All subgroups of order p^k are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of subgroups of order p^k divides the order of G, and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the first Sylow theorem, G has a subgroup of order 3^3 = 27. Let's call this subgroup P. If G has a unique subgroup of order 27, then P must be a normal subgroup of G. In this case, G is cyclic, since it has a normal subgroup of the same order as itself.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is not cyclic. In this case, G must have a subgroup of order 3^2 = 9. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of such subgroups must divide the order of G (27) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibilities are 1 and 3. If there is only one subgroup of order 9, it must be normal, and we can form the direct product of this subgroup with a subgroup of order 3 to obtain a group isomorphic to G. \n\nIf there are three subgroups of order 9, let's call one of them H. Since the index of H in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, H must be normal in G (by the normalizer-centralizer theorem). Now, let K be a subgroup of G of order 3. By the second Sylow theorem, all subgroups of order 3 are conjugate to each other, so there must be a subgroup of order 3 in the normalizer of H. Since H is normal in G, this subgroup of order 3 must be contained in G. Let's call this subgroup L.\n\nNow, consider the elements of H and L. Since H is normal in G, the product of elements from H and L will also be in G. Moreover, since the orders of H and L are relatively prime (9 and 3), their intersection must be the identity element. Therefore, we can form the direct product of H and L, which will have order 3 * 9 = 27. This direct product is isomorphic to G, as desired.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 27, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
