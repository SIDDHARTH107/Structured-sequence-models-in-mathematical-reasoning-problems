    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of a tensor field with respect to a vector field, we need more information about the tensor field and the connection (Christoffel symbols) on the manifold. Let's assume that the tensor field is of rank (1,1), i.e., it has one upper index and one lower index, and is represented by $T^i_j$. Also, let's assume that the connection is given by the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^i_{jk}$.\n\nThe covariant derivative of the tensor field $T^i_j$ with respect to the vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{x^1}}$ is given by:\n\n$(\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{x^1}}} T)^i_j = \\frac{\\partial T^i_j}{\\partial x^1} + \\Gamma^i_{k1} T^k_j - \\Gamma^k_{j1} T^i_k$\n\nTo evaluate this expression at the point $(1,2,3)$, we need the values of the tensor field and the Christoffel symbols at this point. However, since these values are not provided, we cannot compute the covariant derivative explicitly.\n\nIf you provide the tensor field $T^i_j$ and the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^i_{jk}$, we can compute the covariant derivative at the point $(1,2,3)$."
