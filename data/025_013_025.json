    "message_2": "To find the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible values of $x$ and $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$ and checking if they satisfy the equation of the elliptic curve. If they do, we count them as a point on the curve.\n\nLet's start by listing all the points in $\\mathbb{F}_7$:\n\n$$\n\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), \\dots, (6,5), (6,6)\\}\n$$\n\nNow, we can check each point to see if it satisfies the equation of the elliptic curve:\n\n$$\ny^2 \\equiv x^3 + 3x + 1 \\pmod{7}\n$$\n\nDoing this, we find the following points on the curve:\n\n$$\n(0,1), (0,6), (1,2), (1,5), (2,1), (2,6), (3,2), (3,5), (5,0), (6,2), (6,5)\n$$\n\nSo, there are 11 points on the curve. However, we also need to include the point at infinity, which is always a part of the group of points on an elliptic curve. Therefore, the order of the group of points on this elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{F}_7$ is:\n\n$$\n11 + 1 = \\boxed{12}\n$$"
