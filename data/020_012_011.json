The company has two production methods: Method 1 and Method 2. The cost of using Method 1 to produce Product A is $2 and the cost of using Method 2 to produce Product A is $3. The cost of using Method 1 to produce Product B is $5 and the cost of using Method 2 to produce Product B is $4. If the company has a total budget of $100 for production costs, what is the best combination of methods and products to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best combination of methods and products to maximize profit, we need to calculate the net profit for each product-method combination and then find the optimal mix within the $100 budget constraint.\n\nNet profit for each combination:\n1. Product A with Method 1: $4 - $2 = $2\n2. Product A with Method 2: $4 - $3 = $1\n3. Product B with Method 1: $7 - $5 = $2\n4. Product B with Method 2: $7 - $4 = $3\n\nSince the net profit for Product B with Method 2 is the highest, we should prioritize this combination. Let's see how many units of Product B we can produce using Method 2 within the $100 budget:\n\n$100 / $4 (cost per unit) = 25 units\n\nNow, we have used the entire budget to produce 25 units of Product B using Method 2, which gives us the maximum profit:\n\n25 units * $3 (net profit per unit) = $75\n\nSo, the best combination to maximize profit is to produce 25 units of Product B using Method 2, resulting in a profit of $75."
