    "message_2": "To compute the secret key that Alice and Bob will share, we need to follow the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key (A) by calculating A = g^a mod p, where g is the base, a is her private key, and p is the prime modulus.\n2. Bob computes his public key (B) by calculating B = g^b mod p, where g is the base, b is his private key, and p is the prime modulus.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key (s) by calculating s = B^a mod p, using Bob's public key (B) and her private key (a).\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key (s) by calculating s = A^b mod p, using Alice's public key (A) and his private key (b).\n\nNow let's compute the shared secret key:\n\n1. Alice's public key (A): A = 2^4 mod 11 = 16 mod 11 = 5\n2. Bob's public key (B): B = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys (A = 5, B = 8).\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key (s): s = B^a mod p = 8^4 mod 11 = 4096 mod 11 = 3\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key (s): s = A^b mod p = 5^3 mod 11 = 125 mod 11 = 3\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob will share is 3."
