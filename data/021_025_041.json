    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. However, for the given quadratic function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 10, we can find the minimum value using basic calculus without the need for WOA.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function, we can take the derivative and set it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 5\n\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n\n2x + 5 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = -5/2 = -2.5\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the original function to find the minimum value:\n\nf(-2.5) = (-2.5)^2 + 5(-2.5) + 10 = 6.25 - 12.5 + 10 = 3.75\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 10 is 3.75 when x = -2.5."
