    "message_1": "A factory produces 5000 units of a product per month with a production cost of $10 per unit. The factory has decided to increase the production of the product by 20% to meet the demand of the market. However, it requires an increase in production cost by 15%. The factory wants to determine the selling price per unit to maintain the same profit margin as before the increment. Using the Newton-Raphson method, find the selling price per unit that will maintain the same profit margin.",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the profit margin before the increment:\n\nInitial production cost per unit: $10\nLet's assume the initial selling price per unit is S.\n\nProfit per unit = Selling price - Production cost = S - $10\nTotal profit = Profit per unit * Number of units = (S - $10) * 5000\nProfit margin = Total profit / Total revenue = ((S - $10) * 5000) / (S * 5000)\n\nNow, let's consider the changes in production:\n\nIncreased production: 5000 * 1.20 = 6000 units\nIncreased production cost per unit: $10 * 1.15 = $11.50\n\nLet the new selling price per unit be x.\n\nNew profit per unit = x - $11.50\nTotal new profit = (x - $11.50) * 6000\nNew profit margin = ((x - $11.50) * 6000) / (x * 6000)\n\nTo maintain the same profit margin, we need to find x such that:\n\n((S - $10) * 5000) / (S * 5000) = ((x - $11.50) * 6000) / (x * 6000)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n(S - $10) / S = (x - $11.50) / x\n\nNow, we will use the Newton-Raphson method to find the value of x. The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method to find the root of a real-valued function. In this case, we want to find the root of the function:\n\nf(x) = (x - $11.50) / x - (S - $10) / S\n\nLet's assume an initial guess for the selling price x0. We will use the initial selling price S as our initial guess.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nwhere f'(x) is the derivative of f(x) with respect to x.\n\nf'(x) = (1 - $11.50 / x^2)\n\nNow, we will iterate using the Newton-Raphson formula until we reach a desired level of accuracy:\n\nx1 = S - ((S - $10) / S - (S - $11.50) / S) / (1 - $11.50 / S^2)\n\nContinue iterating until the difference between consecutive values of x is very small (e.g., less than 0.001).\n\nOnce the iterations converge, the final value of x will be the new selling price per unit that maintains the same profit margin."
