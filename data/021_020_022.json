    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters and create the initial population of bees.\n2. Employed bees phase: Send the employed bees to search for better food sources.\n3. Onlooker bees phase: Send the onlooker bees to search for better food sources based on the probability of the food source.\n4. Scout bees phase: Replace the abandoned food sources with new ones.\n5. Memorize the best food source found so far.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the given number of iterations.\n\nLet's start solving the problem:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Number of bees: 20\n   - Number of iterations: 100\n   - Lower bound: -5\n   - Upper bound: 5\n   - Function: f(x) = 3x^3 - 7x^2 + 2x + 8\n\n2. Create the initial population of bees with random positions between -5 and 5.\n\n3. Employed bees phase:\n   - For each employed bee, generate a new solution by modifying its current position.\n   - Calculate the fitness of the new solution.\n   - If the new solution is better than the current solution, update the position of the employed bee.\n\n4. Onlooker bees phase:\n   - Calculate the probability of each food source based on its fitness.\n   - For each onlooker bee, select a food source based on its probability and generate a new solution by modifying its position.\n   - Calculate the fitness of the new solution.\n   - If the new solution is better than the current solution, update the position of the onlooker bee.\n\n5. Scout bees phase:\n   - If a food source has been abandoned (i.e., not improved for a certain number of iterations), replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n\n6. Memorize the best food source found so far.\n\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for 100 iterations.\n\nAfter 100 iterations, the best food source found will represent the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^3 - 7x^2 + 2x + 8.\n\nPlease note that as an AI language model, I cannot execute code or perform calculations. However, I hope this explanation helps you understand the process of solving optimization problems using the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm."
