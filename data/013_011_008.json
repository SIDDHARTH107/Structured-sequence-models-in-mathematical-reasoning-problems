    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms: Firm A and Firm B, both selling a similar product. They compete in prices and adopt Bertrand competition. Firm A sets a price of $50 and Firm B sets a price of $45. The market demand for the product is expressed as Q=100-P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. \nWhat will be the total revenue of each firm? Which firm will capture the market and why?",
    "message_2": "In Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers will choose the firm with the lowest price. In this case, Firm A sets a price of $50, and Firm B sets a price of $45. Since Firm B has a lower price, consumers will choose to buy from Firm B, and Firm B will capture the entire market.\n\nTo calculate the total revenue for Firm B, we first need to find the quantity demanded at the price of $45. Using the market demand equation Q = 100 - P, we can plug in the price:\n\nQ = 100 - 45\nQ = 55\n\nSo, the quantity demanded for Firm B's product is 55 units. To find the total revenue, we multiply the price by the quantity demanded:\n\nTotal Revenue = Price × Quantity\nTotal Revenue = $45 × 55\nTotal Revenue = $2,475\n\nTherefore, Firm B's total revenue is $2,475.\n\nSince Firm A has a higher price and consumers choose the lowest price in Bertrand competition, Firm A will not sell any products and its total revenue will be $0.\n\nIn conclusion, Firm B will capture the entire market due to its lower price and will have a total revenue of $2,475, while Firm A will have a total revenue of $0."
