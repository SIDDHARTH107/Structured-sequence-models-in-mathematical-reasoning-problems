    "message_2": "Let's first understand the action of G on X. Given a point (x, y) on X, we have x^2 + y^2 = 1. Now, let g = (a, b; -b, a) ∈ G, where a^2 + b^2 = 1. Then, the action of G on X is given by:\n\ng · (x, y) = (ax + by, -bx + ay).\n\nNow, let's find the invariant polynomials on X under this action of G. A polynomial f(x, y) is invariant under the action of G if f(g · (x, y)) = f(x, y) for all g ∈ G and (x, y) ∈ X.\n\nLet f(x, y) be an invariant polynomial. Then, we have:\n\nf(ax + by, -bx + ay) = f(x, y).\n\nSince a^2 + b^2 = 1, we can write a = cos(θ) and b = sin(θ) for some angle θ. Then, the action of G on X can be written as:\n\ng · (x, y) = (cos(θ)x + sin(θ)y, -sin(θ)x + cos(θ)y).\n\nNow, we want to find the invariant polynomials f(x, y) such that:\n\nf(cos(θ)x + sin(θ)y, -sin(θ)x + cos(θ)y) = f(x, y).\n\nWe can see that the polynomial f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 is invariant under the action of G, since:\n\nf(cos(θ)x + sin(θ)y, -sin(θ)x + cos(θ)y) = (cos(θ)x + sin(θ)y)^2 + (-sin(θ)x + cos(θ)y)^2\n= (cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ))x^2 + 2(cos(θ)sin(θ) - cos(θ)sin(θ))xy + (sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ))y^2\n= x^2 + y^2\n= f(x, y).\n\nNow, let's show that this is the only invariant polynomial. Suppose there exists another invariant polynomial g(x, y) such that g(ax + by, -bx + ay) = g(x, y). Then, we can write g(x, y) as a polynomial in f(x, y):\n\ng(x, y) = h(f(x, y)),\n\nwhere h is a polynomial in one variable. Now, we have:\n\nh(f(ax + by, -bx + ay)) = h(f(x, y)).\n\nSince f(ax + by, -bx + ay) = f(x, y), we have:\n\nh(f(x, y)) = h(f(x, y)).\n\nThus, g(x, y) is a polynomial in f(x, y), which means that g(x, y) is a polynomial in x^2 + y^2.\n\nTherefore, the set of all invariant polynomials on X under this action of G is the set of polynomials in x^2 + y^2."
