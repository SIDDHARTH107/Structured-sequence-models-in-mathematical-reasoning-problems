    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 2, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx + d(4x)/dx - d(2)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 2x^(2-1) + 4 * 1x^(1-1) - 0\nf'(x) = 6x + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at the point x = 5:\n\nf'(5) = 6(5) + 4\nf'(5) = 30 + 4\nf'(5) = 34\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 2 at the point x = 5 is 34."
