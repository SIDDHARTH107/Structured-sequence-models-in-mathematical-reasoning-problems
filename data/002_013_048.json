    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a rectangular base that measures 5 cm by 8 cm and a height of 10 cm. Find the volume of the pyramid.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid is the area of the rectangle, which can be found using the formula:\n\nBase area = length * width\n\nIn this case, the length is 5 cm and the width is 8 cm. So, the base area is:\n\nBase area = 5 cm * 8 cm = 40 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid using the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\nVolume = (1/3) * 40 cm² * 10 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 400 cm³\nVolume = 133.33 cm³ (approximately)\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 133.33 cm³."
