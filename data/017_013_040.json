    "message_2": "To find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we need to consider the prime factorization of 18, which is 2 × 3^2. There are three possibilities for the structure of a group of order 18:\n\n1. A direct product of a group of order 2 and a group of order 9.\n2. A semi-direct product of a group of order 2 and a group of order 9.\n3. A group of order 18 that is not a direct or semi-direct product of smaller groups.\n\nFor the first case, there is only one group of order 2 (Z_2) and one group of order 9 (Z_9). Their direct product is Z_2 × Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_18.\n\nFor the second case, we need to consider the semi-direct products of Z_2 and Z_9. There are two possible actions of Z_2 on Z_9, one being the trivial action and the other being inversion. The trivial action results in the direct product Z_18, which we already counted. The inversion action results in a non-abelian group of order 18, which we'll call G.\n\nFor the third case, we need to consider groups of order 18 that are not direct or semi-direct products of smaller groups. However, it turns out that there are no such groups.\n\nSo, there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 18: Z_18 and G."
