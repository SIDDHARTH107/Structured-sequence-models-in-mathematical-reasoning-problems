    "message_2": "To find the possible number of cyclic subgroups of a group of order 30, we need to consider the divisors of 30. The divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. For each divisor d, there can be a cyclic subgroup of order d. So, there are 8 possible cyclic subgroups for a group of order 30.\n\nNow, let's consider a non-abelian group of order 30. Let's denote this group as G. Since G is non-abelian, it cannot have a unique subgroup of each possible order. \n\nBy Sylow's Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) must divide 6 (30/5) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is that there is one Sylow 5-subgroup, which we can denote as P_5. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (subgroups of order 3) must divide 10 (30/3) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are 1 or 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. We can denote a Sylow 3-subgroup as P_3.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal in G. In this case, G would be a semi-direct product of P_3 and P_5, which are both cyclic. However, this would make G abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, there must be 10 Sylow 3-subgroups in G.\n\nSo, in the non-abelian group of order 30, we have the following cyclic subgroups:\n\n1. The trivial subgroup of order 1.\n2. The whole group G as a cyclic subgroup of order 30 (although G is non-abelian, it can still be considered as a cyclic subgroup of itself).\n3. The unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5.\n4. Ten Sylow 3-subgroups P_3 of order 3.\n\nWe do not have unique cyclic subgroups of orders 2, 6, 10, and 15 in the non-abelian group of order 30. So, there are 4 possibilities for cyclic subgroups in the non-abelian group of order 30."
