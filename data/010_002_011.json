    "message_2": "To determine if the sequence (x_n) converges in (X,T), we need to find a limit point x in X such that for any open set U containing x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, x_n ∈ U.\n\nThe sequence (x_n) is defined as x_n = 1 for all n ∈ N. Therefore, the sequence is constant and equal to 1. The limit point x, if it exists, must be 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the open sets in the topology T that contain the point 1. There are two such open sets: {1} and X.\n\n1. Open set {1}: Since the sequence is constant and equal to 1, for any natural number N, x_n = 1 for all n > N. Thus, x_n ∈ {1} for all n > N.\n\n2. Open set X: Since X contains all elements of the sequence, x_n ∈ X for all n ∈ N.\n\nIn both cases, we can find a natural number N such that for all n > N, x_n ∈ U, where U is an open set containing the limit point x = 1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence (x_n) converges to x = 1 in (X,T)."
