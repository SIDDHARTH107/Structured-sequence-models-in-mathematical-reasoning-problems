    "message_1": "Sorry, but it's not possible to write a precise numerical problem for the subtopic of non-monotonic logic as it deals with reasoning in scenarios where new information can lead to changes in beliefs or conclusions. It does not involve numerical calculations or solving problems with specific values. Instead, a question related to non-monotonic logic could be framed in terms of analyzing a particular scenario or reasoning about the implications of certain assumptions.",
    "message_2": "I understand that non-monotonic logic does not involve numerical calculations. If you have any other mathematical problems or questions related to a different topic, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help."
