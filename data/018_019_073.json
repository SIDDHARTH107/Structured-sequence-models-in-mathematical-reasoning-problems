    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection: A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nFirst, let's find A △ B:\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ C:\n(A △ B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n(A △ B) ∩ C = {3, 4}\n(A △ B) △ C = {1, 5}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference (A △ B) △ C is the set {1, 5}."
