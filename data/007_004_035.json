    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 24, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (24) by the smaller number (18) and find the remainder.\n   24 รท 18 = 1 with a remainder of 6.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (24) with the smaller number (18) and the smaller number with the remainder (6).\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n   18 รท 6 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 18 and 24 is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6."
