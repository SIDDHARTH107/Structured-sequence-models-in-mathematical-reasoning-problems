    "message_2": "In set theory, the total number of subsets that can be formed from a set of n elements is given by the formula 2^n. This is because each element can either be included or not included in a subset, resulting in 2 possibilities for each element.\n\nSo, for a set of 10 elements, the total number of subsets that can be formed is:\n\n2^10 = 1024 subsets"
