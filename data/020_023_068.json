Over the last five years, Security A has had a mean return of 6% with a standard deviation of 10%, while Security B has had a mean return of 8% with a standard deviation of 12%. Your goal is to find the optimal investment strategy that maximizes the expected return while keeping the risk below a certain threshold. What percentage of your investment should be allocated to each security to achieve the optimal portfolio?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio allocation, we can use the concept of the efficient frontier, which is a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. We will assume that the returns of the two securities are uncorrelated, which simplifies the calculations.\n\nLet x be the proportion of the investment in Security A, and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in Security B.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by:\n\nE(Rp) = x * E(Ra) + (1-x) * E(Rb)\n\nwhere E(Ra) and E(Rb) are the expected returns of Security A and Security B, respectively.\n\nThe variance of the portfolio is given by:\n\nVar(Rp) = x^2 * Var(Ra) + (1-x)^2 * Var(Rb)\n\nwhere Var(Ra) and Var(Rb) are the variances of Security A and Security B, respectively.\n\nWe want to maximize the expected return while keeping the risk (measured by the standard deviation) below a certain threshold. To do this, we can set up a Lagrange multiplier problem:\n\nL(x) = E(Rp) - λ * (Var(Rp) - σ^2)\n\nwhere λ is the Lagrange multiplier and σ^2 is the risk threshold.\n\nTaking the derivative of L(x) with respect to x and setting it to zero, we get:\n\ndL(x)/dx = E(Ra) - E(Rb) - 2λ * (x * Var(Ra) - (1-x) * Var(Rb)) = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = (E(Rb) - E(Ra) + 2λ * Var(Rb)) / (2λ * (Var(Ra) + Var(Rb)))\n\nNow, we need to find the value of λ that satisfies the risk constraint. We can do this by plugging x back into the equation for Var(Rp) and setting it equal to σ^2:\n\nσ^2 = x^2 * Var(Ra) + (1-x)^2 * Var(Rb)\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = (E(Rb) - E(Ra)) / (2 * (Var(Ra) + Var(Rb)) * (1 - σ^2 / (Var(Ra) + Var(Rb))))\n\nNow that we have λ, we can plug it back into the equation for x to find the optimal allocation:\n\nx = (E(Rb) - E(Ra) + 2λ * Var(Rb)) / (2λ * (Var(Ra) + Var(Rb)))\n\nGiven the constraints on the investment amounts, we need to ensure that the allocation is within the allowed limits:\n\n0 <= x <= 0.6 (since we can invest at most $60,000 in Security A)\n\nIf x is within these limits, then the optimal allocation is x * 100% in Security A and (1-x) * 100% in Security B. If x is outside these limits, then the optimal allocation is to invest the maximum allowed amount in the security with the higher expected return and the remaining amount in the other security."
