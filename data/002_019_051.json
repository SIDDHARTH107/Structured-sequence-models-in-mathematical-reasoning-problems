    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to find the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base. The base is a circle with a diameter of 8 cm, so the radius is half of that, which is 4 cm. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nA_base = π(4 cm)^2\nA_base = 16π cm^2\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cone is given by the formula A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height.\n\nA_lateral = π(4 cm)(10 cm)\nA_lateral = 40π cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area by adding the base area and the lateral surface area.\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 16π cm^2 + 40π cm^2\nA_total = 56π cm^2\n\nTo round our answer to the nearest hundredth, we can use the approximation π ≈ 3.14.\n\nA_total ≈ 56(3.14) cm^2\nA_total ≈ 175.84 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 175.84 cm^2, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
