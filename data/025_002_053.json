    "message_2": "To calculate the intersection number $L \\cdot C$, we can use the property that the intersection number is equal to the product of the degrees of the two curves. In this case, the degree of the curve $C$ is $4$, and the degree of the line $L$ is $1$ (since a line is a curve of degree $1$).\n\nTherefore, the intersection number $L \\cdot C = 4 \\cdot 1 = 4$.\n\nHowever, we are given that the line $L$ intersects the curve $C$ at exactly $3$ distinct points. This means that there must be a point of intersection with multiplicity greater than $1$. Let's denote the three distinct points of intersection as $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$. Since the total intersection number is $4$, one of these points must have multiplicity $2$, while the other two points have multiplicity $1$. \n\nFor example, let's say $P_1$ has multiplicity $2$, and $P_2$ and $P_3$ have multiplicity $1$. Then the intersection number can be written as:\n\n$L \\cdot C = 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 4$\n\nSo, the intersection number $L \\cdot C = 4$."
