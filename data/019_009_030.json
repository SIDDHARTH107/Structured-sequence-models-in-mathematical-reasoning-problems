    "message_1": "Here's a question for you: \n\nLet A be a statement such that A $\\rightarrow$ (B $\\rightarrow$ C) for any statements B and C. \n\nIf A is true and B is false, what can you say about the truth value of C? \n\nHint: In intuitionistic logic, we can only prove a statement if we have direct evidence for it.",
    "message_2": "Given that A is true and A $\\rightarrow$ (B $\\rightarrow$ C), we can deduce that B $\\rightarrow$ C is true. However, since B is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the truth value of C in intuitionistic logic. This is because, in intuitionistic logic, we require direct evidence for a statement to be proven true, and we do not have that for C in this case."
