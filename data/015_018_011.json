    "message_2": "To determine the value of the parameter $\\alpha$ for which the Duffing oscillator exhibits period-doubling bifurcation, we need to analyze the stability of the system. Period-doubling bifurcation occurs when a stable periodic solution becomes unstable, and a new stable periodic solution with twice the period emerges.\n\nFor the Duffing oscillator, the Poincaré map can be used to study the stability of the periodic solutions. The Poincaré map is a discrete-time dynamical system that describes the evolution of the system at fixed intervals of time. In this case, we will consider the time interval to be the period of the driving force, $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$.\n\nLet $P(x, \\dot{x})$ be the Poincaré map, which maps the state of the system $(x, \\dot{x})$ at time $t$ to the state of the system at time $t + T$. The fixed points of the Poincaré map correspond to the periodic solutions of the Duffing oscillator. The stability of these fixed points can be determined by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the Poincaré map, $J(x, \\dot{x})$.\n\nPeriod-doubling bifurcation occurs when one of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix is equal to -1. To find the value of $\\alpha$ for which this occurs, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n$\\det(J(x, \\dot{x}) - (-1)I) = 0$\n\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nUnfortunately, finding an analytical expression for the Poincaré map and its Jacobian matrix for the Duffing oscillator is not possible due to the nonlinearity of the equation of motion. Therefore, we need to resort to numerical methods to find the value of $\\alpha$ for which period-doubling bifurcation occurs.\n\nBy using numerical continuation techniques, such as the path-following method, we can track the periodic solutions of the Duffing oscillator as a function of the parameter $\\alpha$. By monitoring the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the Poincaré map, we can identify the value of $\\alpha$ for which period-doubling bifurcation occurs.\n\nThe specific value of $\\alpha$ depends on the initial conditions and the numerical method used, and it is not possible to provide an exact value without performing the numerical calculations. However, by using the given values of $\\gamma = 0.1$ and $\\omega = 1.5$, one can find the value of $\\alpha$ for which period-doubling bifurcation occurs in the Duffing oscillator."
