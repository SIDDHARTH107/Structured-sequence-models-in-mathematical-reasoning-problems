    "message_1": "What is the 95% confidence interval for the mean number of hours per week that university students spend studying, if a sample of 100 students report an average of 15 hours per week with a standard deviation of 3 hours, using bootstrapping?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of random samples (with replacement) from the original sample.\n2. Calculate the mean of each random sample.\n3. Arrange the means in ascending order.\n4. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the means.\n\nHowever, as an AI, I am unable to perform bootstrapping directly. Instead, I can provide you with an approximation of the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution, which is a common method for calculating confidence intervals.\n\nGiven the sample size (n = 100), the sample mean (x̄ = 15), and the sample standard deviation (s = 3), we can calculate the standard error (SE) and use the t-distribution to find the 95% confidence interval.\n\nStandard Error (SE) = s / √n = 3 / √100 = 3 / 10 = 0.3\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval and a sample size of 100, the t-value is approximately 1.96 (using a t-table or calculator).\n\nMargin of Error (ME) = t-value * SE = 1.96 * 0.3 = 0.588\n\nLower Limit = x̄ - ME = 15 - 0.588 = 14.412\nUpper Limit = x̄ + ME = 15 + 0.588 = 15.588\n\nThe approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean number of hours per week that university students spend studying is (14.412, 15.588) using the t-distribution method. Keep in mind that the bootstrapping method may yield slightly different results."
