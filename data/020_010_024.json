    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: A and B. The daily demand of product A is normally distributed with a mean of 500 units and a standard deviation of 50 units, while the daily demand of product B is normally distributed with a mean of 800 units and a standard deviation of 100 units. The company has a limited production capacity of 1100 units per day. \n\nThe company wants to determine the optimal production strategy to maximize daily profit, taking into account the uncertainty in demand. The profit per unit of product A is $3, while the profit per unit of product B is $5.\n\nWhat is the optimal production quantity for each product to maximize daily profit, using robust optimization?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using robust optimization, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the demand of each product. We will use the Chebyshev inequality to determine the lower bound of demand for each product.\n\nThe Chebyshev inequality states that for any random variable X with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the probability that X is at least k standard deviations away from the mean is at most 1/k^2. In this case, we want to find the value of k that corresponds to a 95% probability of meeting the demand.\n\n1 - (1/k^2) = 0.95\n1/k^2 = 0.05\nk^2 = 20\nk = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.47\n\nNow, we can calculate the lower bound of demand for each product:\n\nProduct A:\nLower bound = Mean - k * Standard deviation\nLower bound = 500 - 4.47 * 50 ≈ 277.35\n\nProduct B:\nLower bound = Mean - k * Standard deviation\nLower bound = 800 - 4.47 * 100 ≈ 552.65\n\nSince the company has a limited production capacity of 1100 units per day, we need to ensure that the sum of the production quantities for both products does not exceed this limit. Therefore, we can set up the following linear programming problem to maximize daily profit:\n\nLet x be the production quantity of product A and y be the production quantity of product B.\n\nObjective function (to maximize daily profit):\nProfit = 3x + 5y\n\nConstraints:\n1. x + y ≤ 1100 (production capacity constraint)\n2. x ≥ 277.35 (lower bound of demand for product A)\n3. y ≥ 552.65 (lower bound of demand for product B)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem graphically or using a solver. The optimal solution is:\n\nx = 277.35 (production quantity of product A)\ny = 822.65 (production quantity of product B)\n\nThus, the company should produce 277.35 units of product A and 822.65 units of product B to maximize daily profit under the robust optimization approach."
