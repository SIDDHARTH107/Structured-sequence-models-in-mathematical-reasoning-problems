    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(2 |t|), we'll first break it into two cases: one for t ≥ 0 and one for t < 0. Then, we'll use the definition of the Fourier transform and integrate each case separately.\n\nCase 1: t ≥ 0\nFor t ≥ 0, f(t) = e^(2t). The Fourier transform F(ω) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is from 0 to ∞.\n\nCase 2: t < 0\nFor t < 0, f(t) = e^(-2t). The Fourier transform F(ω) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is from -∞ to 0.\n\nNow, we'll find the Fourier transform for each case and sum them up.\n\nCase 1:\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from 0 to ∞\n= ∫[e^((2-jω)t)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nIntegrating with respect to t, we get:\n\nF(ω) = [-1/(2-jω) * e^((2-jω)t)] from 0 to ∞\n= [-1/(2-jω) * (0 - 1)]\n= 1/(2-jω)\n\nCase 2:\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from -∞ to 0\n= ∫[e^((-2-jω)t)] dt from -∞ to 0\n\nIntegrating with respect to t, we get:\n\nF(ω) = [-1/(-2-jω) * e^((-2-jω)t)] from -∞ to 0\n= [-1/(-2-jω) * (1 - 0)]\n= 1/(2+jω)\n\nNow, we'll sum up the Fourier transforms from both cases:\n\nF(ω) = 1/(2-jω) + 1/(2+jω)\n\nTo simplify, we'll find a common denominator:\n\nF(ω) = [(2+jω) + (2-jω)] / [(2-jω)(2+jω)]\n= [4] / [4 + jω(-2) - jω(-2) + (jω)^2]\n= [4] / [4 - (jω)^2]\n= 4 / (4 - (-ω^2))\n= 4 / (4 + ω^2)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(2 |t|) is:\n\nF(ω) = 4 / (4 + ω^2)"
