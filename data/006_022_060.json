    "message_1": "In a school, 60% of students take math classes and 40% take science classes. Out of the students who take math classes, 80% go on to graduate, whereas out of the students who take science classes, 70% go on to graduate. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student will graduate from the school?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen student will graduate from the school, we can use the law of total probability. This states that the probability of an event (in this case, graduating) can be found by multiplying the probability of each possible path to that event and then summing those probabilities.\n\nLet P(G) be the probability of a student graduating, P(M) be the probability of a student taking math classes, and P(S) be the probability of a student taking science classes. We are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(M) = 0.6\nP(S) = 0.4\nP(G|M) = 0.8 (probability of graduating given the student takes math classes)\nP(G|S) = 0.7 (probability of graduating given the student takes science classes)\n\nWe can now use the law of total probability to find P(G):\n\nP(G) = P(G|M) * P(M) + P(G|S) * P(S)\nP(G) = (0.8 * 0.6) + (0.7 * 0.4)\nP(G) = 0.48 + 0.28\nP(G) = 0.76\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen student will graduate from the school is 76%."
