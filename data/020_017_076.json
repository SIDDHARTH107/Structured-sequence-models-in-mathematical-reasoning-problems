    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 3 over the interval [-1, 3], we first find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a), where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic and linear terms, respectively.\n\nIn this case, a = 1 and b = 4, so:\n\nx = -4/(2*1) = -2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the function:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^2 + 4*(-2) + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is at the point (-2, -1). Since the interval we are considering is [-1, 3], the vertex is not within the interval. Therefore, we need to check the function's value at the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^2 + 4*(-1) + 3 = 1 - 4 + 3 = 0\nf(3) = (3)^2 + 4*(3) + 3 = 9 + 12 + 3 = 24\n\nSince f(-1) = 0 and f(3) = 24, the minimum value of f(x) over the interval [-1, 3] is 0."
