Alice's private key is a = 5 and Bob's private key is b = 8. What is the value of the shared secret key?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key (A) using the formula A = g^a mod p\n2. Bob computes his public key (B) using the formula B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula S = B^a mod p\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula S = A^b mod p\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\n1. A = 3^5 mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 15\n2. B = 3^8 mod 17 = 6561 mod 17 = 13\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys: A = 15 and B = 13\n4. S_Alice = 13^5 mod 17 = 371293 mod 17 = 6\n5. S_Bob = 15^8 mod 17 = 2562890625 mod 17 = 6\n\nThe shared secret key is S = 6."
