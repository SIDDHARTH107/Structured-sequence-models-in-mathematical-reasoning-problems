    "message_2": "To find the degree of the divisor D, we sum the coefficients of the points in D. In this case, the degree of D is:\n\ndeg(D) = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6\n\nNow, we need to find the dimension of the linear space L(D). The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a curve C:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the linear space L(D), K is the canonical divisor, and g is the genus of the curve.\n\nFirst, we need to find the genus g of the curve C. The genus can be found using the formula:\n\ng = (n - 1)(n - 2) / 2\n\nwhere n is the degree of the curve. In this case, the degree of the curve is 3 (since the highest degree term is x^3), so:\n\ng = (3 - 1)(3 - 2) / 2 = 2 * 1 / 2 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the canonical divisor K. For a curve of the form y^2 = f(x), the canonical divisor is given by:\n\nK = (2g - 2)P_inf\n\nwhere P_inf is the point at infinity on the curve. In this case, g = 1, so:\n\nK = (2 * 1 - 2)P_inf = 0P_inf\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\nl(D) - l(-D) = 6 + 1 - 1\nl(D) - l(-D) = 6\n\nSince l(-D) is non-negative, we have:\n\nl(D) >= 6\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the linear space L(D) is at least 6."
