The one-time pad is a random string of numbers with the same length as the message. Encrypt the message using the one-time pad \"43521\" and show the resulting ciphertext as a string of numbers.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the one-time pad \"43521\", we first need to convert the message into its ASCII code representation:\n\nH: 72\nE: 69\nL: 76\nL: 76\nO: 79\n\nNow, we will add the corresponding numbers from the one-time pad to the ASCII codes:\n\n72 + 4 = 76\n69 + 3 = 72\n76 + 5 = 81\n76 + 2 = 78\n79 + 1 = 80\n\nThe resulting ciphertext as a string of numbers is: 7672817880"
