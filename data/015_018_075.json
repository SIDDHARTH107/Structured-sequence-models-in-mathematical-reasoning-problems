    "message_1": "A Duffing oscillator is represented by the following equation:\n\nx''(t) + 2γx'(t) + ω_0^2 x(t) + βx(t)^3 = F cos(ωt)\n\nWhere x(t) is the position of the oscillator, γ is the damping coefficient, ω_0 is the natural frequency of the oscillator, β is the non-linear stiffness coefficient, F is the amplitude of the external driving force of frequency ω.\n\nCalculate the steady-state amplitude of the oscillator when F = 2, ω = 5, γ = 0.2, ω_0 = 1, and β = -1, using initial conditions of x(0) = 1 and x'(0) = 0.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state amplitude of the Duffing oscillator, we need to solve the given differential equation numerically. This can be done using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method or by using software like MATLAB or Python.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n1. x'(t) = y(t)\n2. y'(t) = -2γy(t) - ω_0^2 x(t) - βx(t)^3 + F cos(ωt)\n\nNow, we can use the given values for F, ω, γ, ω_0, and β:\n\nF = 2\nω = 5\nγ = 0.2\nω_0 = 1\nβ = -1\n\nAnd the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = 1\nx'(0) = y(0) = 0\n\nUsing a numerical method or software, we can solve the system of first-order differential equations and obtain the time evolution of x(t) and y(t). After a sufficiently long time, the transient behavior will die out, and the oscillator will reach its steady-state behavior. We can then analyze the steady-state behavior of x(t) to find the steady-state amplitude.\n\nSince this is a numerical problem, the exact value of the steady-state amplitude cannot be provided here. However, using a numerical solver and analyzing the steady-state behavior of x(t), you can find the steady-state amplitude of the Duffing oscillator for the given parameters."
