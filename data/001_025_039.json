    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0 in the complex number system, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (Δ):\n\nΔ = b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4(1)(13) = 16 - 52 = -36\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we know that the solutions will be complex numbers.\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2(1)\n\nz = (-4 ± √(36 * -1)) / 2\n\nz = (-4 ± 6i) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the two solutions:\n\nz1 = (-4 + 6i) / 2 = -2 + 3i\n\nz2 = (-4 - 6i) / 2 = -2 - 3i\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0 in the complex number system are z1 = -2 + 3i and z2 = -2 - 3i."
