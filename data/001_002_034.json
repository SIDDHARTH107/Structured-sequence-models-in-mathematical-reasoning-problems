    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 9) using the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), we first need to find the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b).\n\n1. Find the slope (m):\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nm = (9 - 5) / (7 - 3)\nm = 4 / 4\nm = 1\n\n2. Use one of the points to find the y-intercept (b). We'll use (3, 5):\ny = mx + b\n5 = 1 * 3 + b\n5 = 3 + b\nb = 2\n\n3. Write the equation in slope-intercept form:\ny = mx + b\ny = 1x + 2\ny = x + 2\n\nThe equation of the line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 9) is y = x + 2."
