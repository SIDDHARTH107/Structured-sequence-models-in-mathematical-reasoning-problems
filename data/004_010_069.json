    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 2x + 5, we will integrate the function with respect to x.\n\n∫(2x + 5) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\n∫2x dx + ∫5 dx\n\nFor the first term, we have x raised to the power of 1, so we will add 1 to the exponent and divide by the new exponent:\n\n(2x^(1+1))/(1+1) = x^2\n\nFor the second term, since 5 is a constant, we will multiply it by x:\n\n5x\n\nNow, we combine the two terms and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nx^2 + 5x + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 2x + 5 is:\n\nF(x) = x^2 + 5x + C"
