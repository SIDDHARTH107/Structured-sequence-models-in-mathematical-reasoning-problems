    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that increases in length with each iteration. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (initial length) * (multiplier)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations and the multiplier for the Gosper curve is approximately 2.10457.\n\nFor the given problem, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 4 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (2.10457)^4\nLength ≈ 1 * 19.49529\nLength ≈ 19.49529 units\n\nSo, the length of the Gosper curve after 4 iterations is approximately 19.49529 units."
