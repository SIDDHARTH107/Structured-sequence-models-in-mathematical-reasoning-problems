    "message_1": "A machine learning algorithm has been trained to identify fruits based on certain features like color and shape. The algorithm has identified 90% of the fruits correctly. However, when presented with a new fruit that it has never seen before, there is a 20% chance that the algorithm will misclassify it. If the algorithm correctly identifies a fruit as an apple, what is the probability that it is actually an apple?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Bayes' theorem formula:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nwhere:\n- P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has occurred\n- P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has occurred\n- P(A) is the probability of event A happening\n- P(B) is the probability of event B happening\n\nIn this case, let A be the event that the fruit is actually an apple, and B be the event that the algorithm identifies the fruit as an apple.\n\nWe are given:\n- P(B|A) = 0.9 (the algorithm correctly identifies 90% of the fruits)\n- P(A) = probability that the fruit is an apple (we don't have this information, so we'll call it P(A))\n- P(B) = probability that the algorithm identifies a fruit as an apple (we don't have this information either, so we'll call it P(B))\n\nWe are asked to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the fruit is actually an apple given that the algorithm identified it as an apple.\n\nUsing the Bayes' theorem formula:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to calculate P(A|B) directly. We need to know the probabilities P(A) and P(B) to find the exact probability that the fruit is actually an apple given that the algorithm identified it as an apple."
