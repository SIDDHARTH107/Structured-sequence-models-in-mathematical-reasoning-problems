    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the conjugate gradient method, we first need to rewrite the function f(x) in terms of a single variable by substituting the constraint x + y = 1 into the function. We can do this by solving for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 1 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the function f(x):\n\nf(x) = x^2 + 2x(1 - x) + 2(1 - x)^2 + 2x + 4(1 - x)\n\nSimplify the function:\n\nf(x) = x^2 + 2x - 2x^2 + 2(1 - 2x + x^2) + 2x + 4 - 4x\nf(x) = -x^2 + 2x^2 - 4x + 2x^2 + 2x + 4 - 4x\nf(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of this function. To do this, we can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 6\n\nSet f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n6x - 6 = 0\n6x = 6\nx = 1\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding value of y using the constraint x + y = 1:\n\n1 + y = 1\ny = 0\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) occurs at the point (x, y) = (1, 0). To find the minimum value, substitute these values back into the function:\n\nf(1, 0) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1) + 4\nf(1, 0) = 3 - 6 + 4\nf(1, 0) = 1\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2 + 2x + 4y subject to the constraint x + y = 1 is 1."
