    "message_2": "To apply the Jacobi iterative method, we first need to rewrite the given system of linear equations in the form of x = f(x, y, z), y = g(x, y, z), and z = h(x, y, z):\n\nx = (26 - 5y + z) / 4\ny = (10 + 3x - 3z) / 4\nz = 7 - x - y\n\nNow, we can start iterating using the initial guess of x₀ = 0, y₀ = 0, z₀ = 0:\n\nIteration 1:\nx₁ = (26 - 5(0) + 0) / 4 = 6.5\ny₁ = (10 + 3(0) - 3(0)) / 4 = 2.5\nz₁ = 7 - 6.5 - 2.5 = -2\n\nIteration 2:\nx₂ = (26 - 5(2.5) + (-2)) / 4 = 4.5\ny₂ = (10 + 3(6.5) - 3(-2)) / 4 = 4.25\nz₂ = 7 - 4.5 - 4.25 = -1.75\n\nIteration 3:\nx₃ = (26 - 5(4.25) + (-1.75)) / 4 ≈ 4.1875\ny₃ = (10 + 3(4.5) - 3(-1.75)) / 4 ≈ 4.5625\nz₃ = 7 - 4.1875 - 4.5625 ≈ -1.75\n\nSince the values of x, y, and z have not changed by more than 0.0001 between iterations 2 and 3, we can stop the iteration process. The approximate solution to the system of linear equations using the Jacobi iterative method is:\n\nx ≈ 4.1875\ny ≈ 4.5625\nz ≈ -1.75"
