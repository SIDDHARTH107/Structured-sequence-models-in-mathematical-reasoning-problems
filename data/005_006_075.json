If a sample of 25 pistons is randomly selected, what is the probability that the sample mean weight of the pistons will be less than 97 grams? (Assuming normal distribution based on central limit theorem)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 98 grams, the population standard deviation (σ) is 4 grams, and the sample size (n) is 25 pistons.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean):\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\nσ_sample_mean = 4 / √25\nσ_sample_mean = 4 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 0.8 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for a sample mean of 97 grams:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz = (97 - 98) / 0.8\nz = -1 / 0.8\nz = -1.25\n\nNow, we can use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability that the sample mean weight of the pistons will be less than 97 grams. The probability corresponding to a z-score of -1.25 is approximately 0.211.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample mean weight of the pistons will be less than 97 grams is approximately 21.1%."
