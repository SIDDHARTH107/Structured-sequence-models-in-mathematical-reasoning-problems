    "message_2": "To find the minimum horizontal distance, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and we want to find the horizontal distance (x) from the tower.\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this case, the opposite side is the height of the tower (200 meters), and the angle is 45 degrees.\n\ntan(45) = 200 / x\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = 200 / x\n\nTo find x, we can multiply both sides by x and then divide by 1:\n\nx = 200 / 1\nx = 200 meters\n\nSo, the minimum horizontal distance a person needs to stand away from the tower to have an angle of elevation of at least 45 degrees is 200 meters."
