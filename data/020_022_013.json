    "message_1": "A car company produces two models of cars: Model X and Model Y. Model X requires 10 units of steel and 6 units of aluminum to produce, while Model Y requires 8 units of steel and 8 units of aluminum. The company has 100 units of steel and 80 units of aluminum available for production. If the profit generated from selling one unit of Model X is $5,000 and from Model Y is $4,000, what should be the optimal production quantities of the two models to maximize the profit of the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Model X cars produced and y be the number of Model Y cars produced.\n\nWe have two constraints based on the available resources:\n\n1. Steel constraint: 10x + 8y ≤ 100\n2. Aluminum constraint: 6x + 8y ≤ 80\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5000x + 4000y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. Steel constraint: y ≤ (100 - 10x) / 8\n2. Aluminum constraint: y ≤ (80 - 6x) / 8\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region by setting the constraints equal to each other:\n\n1. (100 - 10x) / 8 = (80 - 6x) / 8\n2. 100 - 10x = 80 - 6x\n3. 4x = 20\n4. x = 5\n\nNow substitute x = 5 back into either constraint to find the corresponding y value:\n\ny = (100 - 10 * 5) / 8 = (100 - 50) / 8 = 50 / 8 = 6.25\n\nHowever, we cannot produce a fraction of a car, so we will consider the two closest integer values for y, which are 6 and 7.\n\nCase 1: y = 6\nx = (100 - 8 * 6) / 10 = (100 - 48) / 10 = 52 / 10 = 5.2\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a car, the closest integer value for x is 5.\n\nCase 2: y = 7\nx = (100 - 8 * 7) / 10 = (100 - 56) / 10 = 44 / 10 = 4.4\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a car, the closest integer value for x is 4.\n\nNow we will compare the profit for both cases:\n\nCase 1: P(5, 6) = 5000 * 5 + 4000 * 6 = 25,000 + 24,000 = 49,000\nCase 2: P(4, 7) = 5000 * 4 + 4000 * 7 = 20,000 + 28,000 = 48,000\n\nSince the profit for Case 1 is higher, the optimal production quantities are 5 units of Model X and 6 units of Model Y to maximize the profit of the company, which will be $49,000."
