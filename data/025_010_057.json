    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth plane curve of degree 4 defined by the equation $y^2z - x^3 - x^2z = 0$ and let D be the divisor $D = 2p_1 + 2p_2$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the points $[1, 0, 0]$ and $[0, 1, 0]$ on X, respectively. Use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute the dimension of the space $L(D)$ of rational functions on X with poles of at most order 2 at $p_1$ and $p_2$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space L(D), we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space L(D), K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nFirst, we need to find the genus g of the curve X. For a smooth plane curve of degree d, the genus is given by the formula:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2.\n\nIn our case, d = 4, so the genus is:\n\ng = (4 - 1)(4 - 2)/2 = 3 * 2 / 2 = 3.\n\nNext, we need to find the degree of the divisor D. Since D = 2p_1 + 2p_2, the degree of D is:\n\ndeg(D) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the canonical divisor K. For a smooth plane curve of degree d, the canonical divisor has degree:\n\ndeg(K) = (d - 1)(d - 2) = 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nWe don't need to find the explicit form of K, just its degree. Now we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g = 4 + 1 - 3 = 2.\n\nTo find l(K - D), we need to compute the degree of K - D:\n\ndeg(K - D) = deg(K) - deg(D) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nSince deg(K - D) = 2 and the genus g = 3, we have l(K - D) = 0, because the degree of K - D is less than 2g - 2 = 4.\n\nFinally, we can find the dimension of the space L(D):\n\nl(D) = l(K - D) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nSo the dimension of the space L(D) of rational functions on X with poles of at most order 2 at p_1 and p_2 is 2."
