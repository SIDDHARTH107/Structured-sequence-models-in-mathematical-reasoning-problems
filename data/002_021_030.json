    "message_1": "Given a circle with a radius of 8cm, find the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 60 degrees. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × radius²\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 8 cm.\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 8²\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 64\nArea of sector = (64π) / 6\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14.\n\nArea of sector ≈ (64 × 3.14) / 6\nArea of sector ≈ 200.96 / 6\nArea of sector ≈ 33.49\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the area of the sector is approximately 33 square centimeters."
