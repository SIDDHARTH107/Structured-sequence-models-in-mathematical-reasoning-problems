    "message_2": "To find the x-coordinate of the point resulting from multiplying the scalar k = 3 to the point (2, -1) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 modulo 17, we will perform point addition on the elliptic curve.\n\nFirst, we need to find 2P, where P = (2, -1).\n\nThe slope λ = (3 * (2^2) + 5) * (2 * (-1))^(-1) mod 17 = (12 + 5) * (-2)^(-1) mod 17 = 17 * (-2)^(-1) mod 17\n\nTo find the modular inverse of -2, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n17 = 1(-2) + 9\n-2 = -1(9) + 7\n9 = 1(7) + 2\n7 = 3(2) + 1\n\nNow, working our way back up:\n\n1 = 7 - 3(2)\n1 = 7 - 3(9 - 1(7))\n1 = 4(7) - 3(9)\n1 = 4(7) - 3(-2 - 1(9))\n1 = 4(7) - 3(-2) + 3(9)\n1 = 4(7) + 3(2) - 3(17)\n\nSo, the modular inverse of -2 is 3.\n\nNow, we can find λ:\n\nλ = 17 * 3 mod 17 = 51 mod 17 = 0\n\nNow, we can find the x-coordinate of 2P:\n\nx(2P) = λ^2 - 2 - 2 mod 17 = 0^2 - 4 mod 17 = 13\n\nNow, we need to find 3P = P + 2P. We already have P = (2, -1) and 2P = (13, y(2P)).\n\nTo find y(2P), we can use the elliptic curve equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 mod 17\ny^2 = 13^3 + 5(13) + 7 mod 17 = 2197 + 65 + 7 mod 17 = 2269 mod 17 = 4\n\nSo, y(2P) = ±2. We will use y(2P) = 2, as it will not affect the x-coordinate of the resulting point.\n\nNow, we can find the slope λ for P + 2P:\n\nλ = (2 - (-1)) * (13 - 2)^(-1) mod 17 = 3 * 11^(-1) mod 17\n\nTo find the modular inverse of 11, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n17 = 1(11) + 6\n11 = 1(6) + 5\n6 = 1(5) + 1\n\nNow, working our way back up:\n\n1 = 6 - 1(5)\n1 = 6 - 1(11 - 1(6))\n1 = 2(6) - 1(11)\n1 = 2(17 - 1(11)) - 1(11)\n1 = 2(17) - 3(11)\n\nSo, the modular inverse of 11 is -3, which is equivalent to 14 mod 17.\n\nNow, we can find λ:\n\nλ = 3 * 14 mod 17 = 42 mod 17 = 8\n\nNow, we can find the x-coordinate of 3P:\n\nx(3P) = λ^2 - 2 - 13 mod 17 = 8^2 - 15 mod 17 = 64 - 15 mod 17 = 49 mod 17 = 15\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the point resulting from multiplying the scalar k = 3 to the point (2, -1) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 modulo 17 is 15."
