    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium of this trust game, we need to determine the strategies for both Player A and Player B such that neither player has an incentive to deviate from their strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nLet x be the amount of money Player A sends to Player B, and let y be the fraction of the tripled amount that Player B sends back to Player A. The payoffs for each player are as follows:\n\n- Player A's payoff: 100 - x + 3xy\n- Player B's payoff: x - 3xy\n\nFor Player A, the best response to Player B's strategy is to maximize their payoff. If Player B sends back nothing (y = 0), Player A should not send any money (x = 0) because they would not receive anything in return. If Player B sends back some fraction of the tripled amount (y > 0), Player A should send the entire $100 (x = 100) to maximize their return.\n\nFor Player B, the best response to Player A's strategy is also to maximize their payoff. If Player A sends no money (x = 0), Player B's payoff is 0, and they have no decision to make. If Player A sends some money (x > 0), Player B should send back nothing (y = 0) to maximize their payoff.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are playing their best response strategies. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when Player A sends no money (x = 0) and Player B sends back nothing (y = 0). This is because neither player has an incentive to deviate from their strategy, given the other player's strategy."
