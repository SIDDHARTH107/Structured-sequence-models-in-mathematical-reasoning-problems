    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg game between two firms A and B. The market demand for the product is given by P = 100 – Q where Q is the total output by both firms. Firm A has a cost function of C(Qa) = 10Qa, while firm B has a cost function of C(Qb) = 20Qb. Firm A is the leader and sets its output first. Find the Stackelberg equilibrium quantities and prices.",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg equilibrium quantities and prices, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the output of the other firm.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for Firm B\nTo find the reaction function for Firm B, we need to find the profit-maximizing output for Firm B given the output of Firm A. \n\nProfit for Firm B: πB = P * Qb - C(Qb)\nSubstitute the demand function and cost function: πB = (100 - Q) * Qb - 20Qb\nSimplify: πB = 100Qb - Q * Qb - 20Qb\nSince Q = Qa + Qb: πB = 100Qb - (Qa + Qb) * Qb - 20Qb\nExpand: πB = 100Qb - Qa * Qb - Qb^2 - 20Qb\nCombine like terms: πB = 80Qb - Qa * Qb - Qb^2\n\nTo find the best response, we need to maximize πB with respect to Qb. To do this, we take the first-order derivative with respect to Qb and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(πB)/dQb = 80 - Qa - 2Qb = 0\n\nSolve for Qb to get Firm B's reaction function:\nQb = (80 - Qa) / 2\n\nStep 2: Find the optimal output for Firm A\nTo find the optimal output for Firm A, we need to find the profit-maximizing output for Firm A given the reaction function of Firm B.\n\nProfit for Firm A: πA = P * Qa - C(Qa)\nSubstitute the demand function and cost function: πA = (100 - Q) * Qa - 10Qa\nSimplify: πA = 100Qa - Q * Qa - 10Qa\nSince Q = Qa + Qb: πA = 100Qa - (Qa + Qb) * Qa - 10Qa\nExpand: πA = 100Qa - Qa^2 - Qa * Qb - 10Qa\nCombine like terms: πA = 90Qa - Qa^2 - Qa * Qb\n\nNow, substitute Firm B's reaction function into Firm A's profit function:\nπA = 90Qa - Qa^2 - Qa * ((80 - Qa) / 2)\n\nExpand and simplify: πA = 90Qa - Qa^2 - 40Qa + (1/2)Qa^2\nCombine like terms: πA = 50Qa - (1/2)Qa^2\n\nTo find the best response, we need to maximize πA with respect to Qa. To do this, we take the first-order derivative with respect to Qa and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(πA)/dQa = 50 - Qa = 0\n\nSolve for Qa:\nQa = 50\n\nStep 3: Find the optimal output for Firm B\nNow that we have the optimal output for Firm A, we can find the optimal output for Firm B using its reaction function:\n\nQb = (80 - Qa) / 2\nQb = (80 - 50) / 2\nQb = 30 / 2\nQb = 15\n\nStep 4: Find the equilibrium price\nNow that we have the equilibrium quantities for both firms, we can find the equilibrium price using the demand function:\n\nP = 100 - Q\nP = 100 - (Qa + Qb)\nP = 100 - (50 + 15)\nP = 100 - 65\nP = 35\n\nThe Stackelberg equilibrium quantities and prices are Qa = 50, Qb = 15, and P = 35."
