    "message_2": "To calculate the value of n, we multiply the prime numbers p and q:\n\nn = p * q\nn = 11 * 7\nn = 77\n\nNow, we need to calculate the value of φ(n), which is given by the formula:\n\nφ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\nφ(77) = (11 - 1) * (7 - 1)\nφ(77) = 10 * 6\nφ(77) = 60\n\nNow we need to find a public key exponent e, where e is coprime to φ(n) and less than φ(n). A coprime number is a number that shares no common factors with φ(n) other than 1. We can start by trying the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue with other prime numbers until we find a suitable e.\n\n2 is not coprime to 60 because they share a common factor of 2.\n3 is not coprime to 60 because they share a common factor of 3.\n5 is not coprime to 60 because they share a common factor of 5.\n\nThe next prime number is 7, and it is coprime to 60 because they share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, we can choose e = 7 as the public key exponent."
