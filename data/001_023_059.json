    "message_2": "The given equation is not possible, as it contradicts the fundamental trigonometric identity: sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 for all values of x. The equation sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1/2 cannot be true, as it would mean that the sum of the squares of sin(x) and cos(x) is equal to 1/2, which is not possible according to the trigonometric identity."
