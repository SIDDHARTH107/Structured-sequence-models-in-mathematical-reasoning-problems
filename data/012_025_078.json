    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. To find a Hamiltonian cycle, we can try to construct a path that visits each vertex exactly once.\n\nLet's start with vertex 1 and try to find a Hamiltonian cycle:\n\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 1\n\nThis path visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, so it is a Hamiltonian cycle. Therefore, the graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and one such cycle is (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 6, 5, 1)."
