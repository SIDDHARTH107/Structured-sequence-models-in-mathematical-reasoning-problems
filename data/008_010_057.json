Perform row operations to get the matrix in row echelon form.\n3. Continue with row operations to get the matrix in reduced row echelon form.\n4. Write the system of equations from the matrix and solve for the variables.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix of the system.\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  6 ]\n[ 2  3  1 |  1 ]\n[ 3 -1  2 |  8 ]\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to get the matrix in row echelon form.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 3*R1\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -1  3 | -11]\n[ 0 -7  5 | -10]\n\nR3 = R3 - 7*R2\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -1  3 | -11]\n[ 0  0 -16| -67]\n\nStep 3: Continue with row operations to get the matrix in reduced row echelon form.\n\nR3 = R3 / -16\nR2 = R2 - 3*R3\nR1 = R1 + R2\n\n[ 1  0  1 |  1 ]\n[ 0  1 -3 |  3 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 67/16]\n\nStep 4: Write the system of equations from the matrix and solve for the variables.\n\nx + z = 1\ny - 3z = 3\nz = 67/16\n\nNow we can solve for x and y using back-substitution:\n\nz = 67/16\ny = 3 + 3z = 3 + 3(67/16) = 3(1 + 67/16) = 3(83/16) = 249/16\nx = 1 - z = 1 - 67/16 = (16 - 67)/16 = -51/16\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -51/16\ny = 249/16\nz = 67/16"
