    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\n1. First, let's parameterize the surface:\nLet x = u and y = v, then the parameterization is given by:\nr(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\n2. Now, let's find the first fundamental form:\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\n3. Calculate the first fundamental form coefficients:\nE = ru • ru = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = ru • rv = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = rv • rv = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\n4. Now, let's find the second fundamental form:\nruu = d^2r/du^2 = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = d^2r/dudv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = d^2r/dv^2 = (0, 0, 2)\n\n5. Calculate the second fundamental form coefficients:\nL = ruu • N = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\nM = ruv • N = (0, 0, 0) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 0\nN = rvv • N = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface, which can be found by taking the cross product of ru and rv:\nN = ru × rv = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, 2v) = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\n6. Finally, let's find the mean curvature H:\nH = (1/2) * (1/(EG - F^2)) * (EN + GL - 2FM)\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have E = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5, F = 4(1)(1) = 4, G = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5.\nSo, EG - F^2 = 5*5 - 4^2 = 25 - 16 = 9\n\nH = (1/2) * (1/9) * (2*5 + 2*5 - 2*0) = (1/2) * (1/9) * 20 = 10/9\n\nTherefore, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) is H = 10/9."
