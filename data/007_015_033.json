    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two, in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. To find the 7th Mersenne prime, we first need to find the first 7 prime exponents (n values) for which the Mersenne numbers are prime.\n\nThe first 7 prime exponents are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, and 19.\n\nNow, we can calculate the 7th Mersenne prime using the 7th prime exponent:\n\nM_19 = 2^19 - 1 = 524288 - 1 = 524287\n\nSo, the 7th Mersenne prime number is 524,287."
