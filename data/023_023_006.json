    "message_1": "A communication network transmits a signal which can be modeled by the function f(t) = 5cos(100πt) + 3sin(200πt) + 4cos(300πt). Use the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and frequency of each of its constituent waves.",
    "message_2": "The given function f(t) is already expressed as a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and frequency of each constituent wave. The function is given by:\n\nf(t) = 5cos(100πt) + 3sin(200πt) + 4cos(300πt)\n\nWe can directly read the amplitude and frequency of each wave from the function:\n\n1. The first wave has an amplitude of 5 and a frequency of 100π rad/s (or 50 Hz).\n2. The second wave has an amplitude of 3 and a frequency of 200π rad/s (or 100 Hz).\n3. The third wave has an amplitude of 4 and a frequency of 300π rad/s (or 150 Hz).\n\nSo, the constituent waves have amplitudes of 5, 3, and 4, and frequencies of 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 150 Hz, respectively."
