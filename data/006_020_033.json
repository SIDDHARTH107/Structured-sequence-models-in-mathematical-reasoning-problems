    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least 3 guests having the same birth month, we will find the probability of no more than 2 guests having the same birth month and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so we will distribute the 50 guests among the 12 months.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of all guests having different birth months. This is not possible since there are only 12 months and 50 guests, so this probability is 0.\n\nNext, let's find the probability of no more than 2 guests having the same birth month. We will use the multinomial coefficient to calculate this.\n\nThe multinomial coefficient is:\n\nC(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of guests (50), and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of guests in each month.\n\nWe want to find the number of ways to distribute the 50 guests among the 12 months such that no more than 2 guests have the same birth month. This can be represented as:\n\nC(50; 2, 2, ..., 2, 1, 1, ..., 1)\n\nThere are 26 guests distributed with 2 guests in each of the first 12 months, and the remaining 24 guests distributed with 1 guest in each of the 12 months.\n\nThe multinomial coefficient for this distribution is:\n\nC(50; 2, 2, ..., 2, 1, 1, ..., 1) = 50! / ((2!^12) * (1!^24))\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to distribute the 50 guests among the 12 months without any restrictions. This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(61, 11) = 61! / (11! * 50!)\n\nThe probability of no more than 2 guests having the same birth month is:\n\nP = C(50; 2, 2, ..., 2, 1, 1, ..., 1) / C(61, 11)\n\nFinally, the probability of at least 3 guests having the same birth month is:\n\n1 - P\n\nCalculating the exact values:\n\n50! = 3.04140932 × 10^64\n2! = 2\n1! = 1\n61! = 5.07579712 × 10^83\n11! = 3.99168 × 10^7\n\nC(50; 2, 2, ..., 2, 1, 1, ..., 1) = (3.04140932 × 10^64) / ((2^12) * (1^24)) ≈ 1.86265552 × 10^63\n\nC(61, 11) = (5.07579712 × 10^83) / ((3.99168 × 10^7) * (3.04140932 × 10^64)) ≈ 4.213597 × 10^69\n\nP = (1.86265552 × 10^63) / (4.213597 × 10^69) ≈ 0.000442\n\n1 - P ≈ 1 - 0.000442 = 0.999558\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 guests will have the same birth month is approximately 0.999558 or 99.96%."
