    "message_1": "A long, thin, metal rod with length L = 10 m is held under tension between two fixed points. The initial temperature of the rod is given by T(x,0) = sin(2πx/L) for 0 ≤ x ≤ L. The ends of the rod are kept at zero temperature. Find the temperature distribution of the rod as a function of time t seconds. Use the Fourier series method to solve the partial differential equation that governs the temperature distribution. Also, find the temperature at a distance of x = L/4 from the left end of the rod after 5 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the rod as a function of time, we need to solve the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nThe boundary conditions are T(0,t) = T(L,t) = 0, and the initial condition is T(x,0) = sin(2πx/L).\n\nWe will solve this problem using the Fourier series method. First, we assume that the solution can be separated into a product of functions of x and t:\n\nT(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) ∂T(t) / ∂t = α T(t) ∂²X(x) / ∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we obtain:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t) / ∂t = (1/X) ∂²X(x) / ∂x²\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of t only and the right-hand side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t) / ∂t = -λ²\n(1/X) ∂²X(x) / ∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) ∂²X(x) / ∂x² + λ²X(x) = 0 with boundary conditions X(0) = X(L) = 0\n2) ∂T(t) / ∂t + αλ²T(t) = 0\n\nSolving equation 1) with the boundary conditions, we find that λ_n = (2n-1)π/(2L) for n = 1, 2, 3, ... and the corresponding eigenfunctions are X_n(x) = sin(λ_n x).\n\nSolving equation 2), we find that T_n(t) = exp(-αλ_n²t).\n\nThus, the solution to the heat equation is given by the sum of the product of the eigenfunctions and time-dependent functions:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ [sin(λ_n x) exp(-αλ_n²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients, we use the initial condition T(x,0) = sin(2πx/L) and compare it with the Fourier series:\n\nsin(2πx/L) = Σ [sin(λ_n x)]\n\nSince λ_1 = 2π/L, we can see that only the first term in the series is needed to match the initial condition. Therefore, the temperature distribution is:\n\nT(x,t) = sin(2πx/L) exp(-α(2π/L)²t)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature at x = L/4 and t = 5 seconds:\n\nT(L/4, 5) = sin(2π(L/4)/L) exp(-α(2π/L)²(5))\n\nAssuming the thermal diffusivity α is given, we can plug in the value to find the temperature at the specified point."
