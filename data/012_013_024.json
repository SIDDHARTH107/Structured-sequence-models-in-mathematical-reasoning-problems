    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of G with k colors. We will proceed as follows:\n\n1. Choose an edge e = (2,3) from G.\n2. Calculate P(G-e, k), where G-e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e from G.\n3. Calculate P(G/e, k), where G/e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e in G.\n4. Use the formula P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k).\n\nStep 2: Calculate P(G-e, k)\nG-e has the following edges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)}.\nThis graph is a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)^(n-1) where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n=6, so P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^5.\n\nStep 3: Calculate P(G/e, k)\nG/e has the following vertices and edges: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5)}.\nThis graph is a cycle of length 5 (C5). The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length 5 is k(k-1)(k-2) + (-1)^5 * (k-1).\nSo, P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) - (k-1).\n\nStep 4: Use the formula P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^5 - [k(k-1)(k-2) - (k-1)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^5 - k(k-1)(k-2) + (k-1)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of G."
