    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = \\frac{z+1}{(z-2)(z-1)} centered at z=1, we first perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = \\frac{A}{z-1} + \\frac{B}{z-2}\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z-2)(z-1), we get:\n\nz+1 = A(z-2) + B(z-1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in convenient values for z:\n\nFor z = 1:\n1+1 = A(1-2) + B(1-1) => A = -2\n\nFor z = 2:\n2+1 = A(2-1) + B(2-2) => B = 3\n\nSo, f(z) = \\frac{-2}{z-1} + \\frac{3}{z-2}\n\nNow, we can rewrite the terms in the form of a Laurent series centered at z=1:\n\nf(z) = -2\\frac{1}{z-1} + 3\\frac{1}{(z-1)-1}\n\nLet's rewrite the second term using the geometric series formula:\n\nf(z) = -2\\frac{1}{z-1} + 3\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (z-1)^n\n\nNow, we have the Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z=1:\n\nf(z) = -2\\frac{1}{z-1} + 3 + 3\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (z-1)^n\n\nThe annulus of convergence for this Laurent series is determined by the region where the geometric series converges. The geometric series converges when the absolute value of the ratio is less than 1:\n\n|z-1| < 1\n\nThis inequality defines an open disk centered at z=1 with a radius of 1. However, since the Laurent series has a pole at z=1, the annulus of convergence is given by:\n\n0 < |z-1| < 1\n\nSo, the annulus of convergence is the region between two concentric circles centered at z=1 with radii 0 and 1."
