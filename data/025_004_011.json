    "message_2": "To find the degree of the curve, we need to look at the highest degree of a monomial term in the equation. Let's expand the equation:\n\n$y^2z = x(x - z)(x - 2z)$\n\n$y^2z = x(x^2 - 2xz - xz + 2z^2)$\n\n$y^2z = x^3 - 3x^2z + 2xz^2$\n\nNow, we can see that the highest degree of a monomial term in the equation is 3 (from the term $x^3$). Therefore, the degree of this curve is 3."
