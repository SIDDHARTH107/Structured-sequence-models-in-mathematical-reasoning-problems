    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset of test scores for a class of 30 students. The mean score is 75 and the standard deviation is 10. After analyzing the dataset, you found that one of the scores is an outlier. If the outlier has a z-score of 2.5, what is the actual test score of the outlier?",
    "message_2": "To find the actual test score of the outlier, we can use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\n\nwhere z is the z-score, x is the actual test score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. We are given z = 2.5, μ = 75, and σ = 10. We need to solve for x.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for x, we get:\n\nx = (z * σ) + μ\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nx = (2.5 * 10) + 75\n\nx = 25 + 75\n\nx = 100\n\nThe actual test score of the outlier is 100."
