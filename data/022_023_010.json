Suppose you have a string fixed at both ends and initially given a sinusoidal displacement with a frequency of 50 Hz and an amplitude of 5 cm. Determine the general solution for the displacement of the string, assuming that the length of the string is 1 meter and c=500 m/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the wave equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T''(t) = c² X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT''(t) / T(t) = c² X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -k²:\n\nT''(t) / T(t) = c² X''(x) / X(x) = -k²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) T''(t) + k²T(t) = 0\n2) X''(x) + (k²/c²)X(x) = 0\n\nThe general solution for equation (1) is:\n\nT(t) = A*cos(kt) + B*sin(kt)\n\nThe general solution for equation (2) is:\n\nX(x) = C*cos(λx) + D*sin(λx), where λ = k/c\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions. Since the string is fixed at both ends, u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0. This implies:\n\nX(0) = C*cos(0) + D*sin(0) = C = 0\nX(1) = D*sin(λ) = 0\n\nSince D cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(λ) = 0, which implies λ = nπ for some integer n. Thus, the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = D*sin(nπx)\n\nNow, we form the general solution for u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = (A*cos(kt) + B*sin(kt)) * sin(nπx)\n\nThe initial conditions are given as a sinusoidal displacement with a frequency of 50 Hz and an amplitude of 5 cm:\n\nu(x, 0) = 0.05 * sin(2π * 50 * x)\n\nComparing this with the general solution, we can see that n = 50 and A = 0.05. Thus, the general solution for the displacement of the string is:\n\nu(x, t) = 0.05 * cos(k * 50π * t) * sin(50π * x)"
