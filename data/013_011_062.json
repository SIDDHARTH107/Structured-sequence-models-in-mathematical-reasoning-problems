    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms, A and B, both selling identical products. Firm A chooses a price of $10 and firm B simultaneously chooses a price of either $8 or $12. If both firms choose the same price, they split the market equally. However, if one firm chooses a lower price than the other, the firm with the lower price captures the entire market. \n\nWhat is the best strategy for firm B, and what is the expected profit for each firm under this strategy?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for firm B, we need to compare the expected profits for each pricing option. Let's assume that the market size is M.\n\n1. If firm B chooses a price of $8:\n- Firm B captures the entire market, so its profit is 8M.\n- Firm A gets no share of the market, so its profit is 0.\n\n2. If firm B chooses a price of $12:\n- Firm A captures the entire market with a lower price, so its profit is 10M.\n- Firm B gets no share of the market, so its profit is 0.\n\nThe best strategy for firm B is to choose a price of $8, as it guarantees a profit of 8M, while choosing a price of $12 results in no profit.\n\nUnder this strategy, the expected profit for firm A is 0, and the expected profit for firm B is 8M."
