    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = 4x^3 with respect to x using the power rule, we apply the rule:\n\n(d/dx) [x^n] = nx^(n-1)\n\nIn this case, n = 3. So, applying the power rule to f(x) = 4x^3, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4 * (3x^(3-1))\nf'(x) = 12x^2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 4x^3 with respect to x is f'(x) = 12x^2."
