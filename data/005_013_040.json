The following table shows their scores:\n\n| Student | Mathematics | Science | English |\n|---------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| 1       | 60          | 70      | 75      |\n| 2       | 70          | 75      | 80      |\n| 3       | 80          | 85      | 90      |\n| ...     | ...         | ...     | ...     |\n| 50      | 65          | 80      | 75      |\n\nUsing multivariate analysis, determine the correlation between the scores of Mathematics and Science. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To determine the correlation between the scores of Mathematics and Science, we will use the Pearson correlation coefficient formula. However, since we do not have the complete data for all 50 students, I will provide the general formula and steps to calculate the correlation coefficient.\n\nPearson correlation coefficient (r) formula:\n\nr = (Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)]) / sqrt(Σ(xi - x̄)^2 * Σ(yi - ȳ)^2)\n\nwhere:\nxi and yi are individual data points for Mathematics and Science respectively,\nx̄ and ȳ are the mean scores for Mathematics and Science respectively,\nΣ denotes the sum of the values.\n\nSteps to calculate the correlation coefficient:\n\n1. Calculate the mean scores for Mathematics (x̄) and Science (ȳ).\n2. For each student, calculate the product of the differences between their Mathematics and Science scores and their respective mean scores: (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ).\n3. Sum up the products from step 2.\n4. Calculate the sum of the squared differences between each Mathematics score and the mean Mathematics score: Σ(xi - x̄)^2.\n5. Calculate the sum of the squared differences between each Science score and the mean Science score: Σ(yi - ȳ)^2.\n6. Multiply the sums from steps 4 and 5, and then take the square root of the result.\n7. Divide the sum from step 3 by the result from step 6 to obtain the correlation coefficient (r).\n\nAfter calculating the correlation coefficient (r) using the given data, round your answer to two decimal places."
