    "message_1": "The abductive logic problem for a math student is:\n\nSuppose that a fair coin is flipped three times, but you are not told the outcomes. You notice that the sum of the outcomes is an odd number. What is the probability that the first outcome was heads? \n\nHint: You'll need to use abductive reasoning to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's use H for heads and T for tails. Since the sum of the outcomes is odd, there must be an odd number of heads. There are two possibilities: either there is exactly one head or there are three heads.\n\n1. One head: There are three possible combinations: H-T-T, T-H-T, and T-T-H.\n2. Three heads: There is only one possible combination: H-H-H.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the first outcome was heads. Out of the four possible combinations mentioned above, two of them have heads as the first outcome: H-T-T and H-H-H.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first outcome was heads is 2/4 or 1/2 (50%)."
