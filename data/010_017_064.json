Prove that the first $i$ Morse inequalities holds for $i=0,1,\\ldots,n$, where the $i^{th}$ Morse inequalities is given by:\n\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{i}(-1)^j\\mathrm{rank}(H_j(M;\\mathbb{Z})) \\leq\\sum_{p\\text{ is a critical point of f with index}\\leq i}(-1)^{\\mathrm{index}(p)}$$\n\nIf $n=4$, $k=5$ and the indices of the critical points of $f$ are $0,1,2,2,3$, then determine the Betti numbers $b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4$ of $M$ using the first four Morse inequalities.",
    "message_2": "To prove the Morse inequalities, we will use the Morse complex. The Morse complex is a chain complex $(C_*,\\partial_*)$ associated to the Morse function $f$ and a gradient-like vector field $X$ on $M$. The chain groups $C_i$ are generated by the critical points of index $i$, and the boundary maps $\\partial_i$ are defined using the flow lines of $X$. The homology of this complex, called Morse homology, is isomorphic to the singular homology of $M$.\n\nNow, let's consider the first $i$ Morse inequalities:\n\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{i}(-1)^j\\mathrm{rank}(H_j(M;\\mathbb{Z})) \\leq\\sum_{p\\text{ is a critical point of f with index}\\leq i}(-1)^{\\mathrm{index}(p)}$$\n\nSince the Morse homology is isomorphic to the singular homology, we have:\n\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{i}(-1)^j\\mathrm{rank}(H_j(M;\\mathbb{Z})) = \\sum_{j=0}^{i}(-1)^j b_j$$\n\nwhere $b_j$ are the Betti numbers of $M$. Now, let's compute the right-hand side of the inequality for the given Morse function with critical points of indices $0,1,2,2,3$. We have:\n\n$$\\sum_{p\\text{ is a critical point of f with index}\\leq i}(-1)^{\\mathrm{index}(p)} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } i=0 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } i=1 \\\\\n-1 & \\text{if } i=2 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } i=3 \\\\\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nNow, we can use the first four Morse inequalities to determine the Betti numbers $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$ of $M$:\n\n1. For $i=0$, we have $b_0 = 1$.\n2. For $i=1$, we have $b_1 - b_0 \\leq 0 \\Rightarrow b_1 \\leq 1$.\n3. For $i=2$, we have $b_2 - b_1 + b_0 \\leq -1 \\Rightarrow b_2 \\leq b_1$.\n4. For $i=3$, we have $b_3 - b_2 + b_1 - b_0 \\leq 0 \\Rightarrow b_3 \\leq b_2 - b_1 + 1$.\n\nSince $b_1 \\leq 1$ and $b_2 \\leq b_1$, we must have $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 1$. Then, $b_3 \\leq b_2 - b_1 + 1 = 1$, so $b_3 = 0$ or $b_3 = 1$. However, since the sum of the Betti numbers must equal the number of critical points, we have $b_0 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 5$, which implies that $b_3 = 1$. Finally, since $M$ is a 4-dimensional manifold, we have $b_4 = 0$.\n\nThus, the Betti numbers of $M$ are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 1$, $b_3 = 1$, and $b_4 = 0$."
