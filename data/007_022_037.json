Alice chose the elliptic curve with equation y^2 = x^3 + 3x - 5 (mod 11), which contains the point P = (1, 2) of order 7. Alice chooses her secret key as 3 and her public key as 3P. What is Alice's public key in the group of points on the elliptic curve modulo 11?",
    "message_2": "To find Alice's public key, we need to compute 3P, which means adding the point P to itself three times. We will use the formulas for point addition and point doubling on elliptic curves.\n\nLet's first find 2P:\nFor point doubling, we use the formula:\nλ = (3x1^2 + a) / 2y1 (mod p)\nν = λ^2 - 2x1 (mod p)\n\nHere, P = (1, 2), a = 3, and p = 11.\n\nλ = (3(1)^2 + 3) / (2(2)) (mod 11)\nλ = (3 + 3) / 4 (mod 11)\nλ = 6 / 4 (mod 11)\nSince 4 has an inverse modulo 11, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 (which is 3) to get:\nλ = 6 * 3 (mod 11)\nλ = 18 (mod 11)\nλ = 7 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can find ν:\nν = λ^2 - 2x1 (mod 11)\nν = 7^2 - 2(1) (mod 11)\nν = 49 - 2 (mod 11)\nν = 47 (mod 11)\nν = 9 (mod 11)\n\nSo, 2P = (9, 7).\n\nNow, we need to find 3P, which is P + 2P:\nFor point addition, we use the formula:\nλ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) (mod p)\nν = λ^2 - x1 - x2 (mod p)\n\nHere, P = (1, 2) and 2P = (9, 7).\n\nλ = (7 - 2) / (9 - 1) (mod 11)\nλ = 5 / 8 (mod 11)\nSince 8 has an inverse modulo 11, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of 8 (which is 7) to get:\nλ = 5 * 7 (mod 11)\nλ = 35 (mod 11)\nλ = 2 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can find ν:\nν = λ^2 - x1 - x2 (mod 11)\nν = 2^2 - 1 - 9 (mod 11)\nν = 4 - 1 - 9 (mod 11)\nν = -6 (mod 11)\nν = 5 (mod 11)\n\nSo, 3P = (2, 5).\n\nTherefore, Alice's public key in the group of points on the elliptic curve modulo 11 is (2, 5)."
