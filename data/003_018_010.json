    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3cos(4x) - 2sin(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, we have two terms, so we'll find the derivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst term: 3cos(4x)\nOuter function: 3cos(u), where u = 4x\nInner function: u = 4x\n\nDerivative of the outer function with respect to u: -3sin(u)\nDerivative of the inner function with respect to x: 4\n\nUsing the chain rule: dy/dx = -3sin(u) * 4 = -12sin(4x)\n\nSecond term: -2sin(2x)\nOuter function: -2sin(v), where v = 2x\nInner function: v = 2x\n\nDerivative of the outer function with respect to v: -2cos(v)\nDerivative of the inner function with respect to x: 2\n\nUsing the chain rule: dy/dx = -2cos(v) * 2 = -4cos(2x)\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of both terms:\n\ndy/dx = -12sin(4x) - 4cos(2x)\n\nNow we'll find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = -12sin(4(π/4)) - 4cos(2(π/4))\ndy/dx(π/4) = -12sin(π) - 4cos(π/2)\ndy/dx(π/4) = -12(0) - 4(0)\ndy/dx(π/4) = 0\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 3cos(4x) - 2sin(2x) at x = π/4 is 0."
