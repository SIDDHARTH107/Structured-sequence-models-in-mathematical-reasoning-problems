    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree.\n4. Repeat step 3 until there are (V-1) edges in the minimum spanning tree, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n1. Sorting the edges by weight:\n(1-2): 1\n(2-3): 1\n(3-4): 2\n(1-4): 3\n(2-4): 3\n(1-3): 4\n\n2. Start with an empty graph.\n\n3. Add edges one by one:\n- Add edge (1-2): 1\n- Add edge (2-3): 1\n- Adding edge (3-4): 2 would form a cycle, so skip it.\n- Adding edge (1-4): 3 would form a cycle, so skip it.\n- Adding edge (2-4): 3 would form a cycle, so skip it.\n- Add edge (1-3): 4\n\n4. We have added (V-1) = 3 edges to the minimum spanning tree.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is as follows:\n\n(1-2): 1\n(2-3): 1\n(1-3): 4\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6."
