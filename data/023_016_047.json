    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to determine the coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0. Since the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be 0. We can find the b_n coefficients using the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx, where L is the half-period of the function.\n\nIn this case, L = π. So, the formula for b_n becomes:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/π)]dx\n\nWe need to calculate b_n for the two intervals where f(x) is non-zero:\n\nFor -π ≤ x < 0, f(x) = -1:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[-1 * sin(nx)]dx from -π to 0\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-1/n * cos(nx)] from -π to 0\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n * cos(0)) - (-1/n * cos(-nπ))]\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n) - (-1/n * cos(nπ))]\n\nFor 0 ≤ x < π, f(x) = 1:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[1 * sin(nx)]dx from 0 to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-1/n * cos(nx)] from 0 to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n * cos(nπ)) - (-1/n * cos(0))]\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n * cos(nπ)) + (1/n)]\n\nNow, we can add the b_n coefficients for both intervals:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n) - (-1/n * cos(nπ)) + (-1/n * cos(nπ)) + (1/n)]\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n) + (1/n)]\n\nb_n = 0\n\nSince all a_n and b_n coefficients are 0, the Fourier series of f(x) is just a constant term a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, its integral over a symmetric interval is 0. Therefore, a_0 = 0.\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) is 0 for all x.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the Fourier series converges to f(x) at x = π/2. Since f(π/2) = 1 and the Fourier series is 0, the Fourier series does not converge to f(x) at x = π/2."
