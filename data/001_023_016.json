    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation cos(2x) + 2sin(x) = 0 for x in the interval [0, 2π), we can first use the double angle formula for cosine:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x)\n\nNow substitute this into the original equation:\n\n1 - 2sin^2(x) + 2sin(x) = 0\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n2sin^2(x) - 2sin(x) + 1 = 0\n\nNow, let y = sin(x). The equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 - 2y + 1 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 2:\n\ny^2 - y + 0.5 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for y:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = 0.5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(0.5))) / 2(1)\ny = (1 ± √(1 - 2)) / 2\ny = (1 ± √(-1)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for y. Therefore, there are no real solutions for x in the given interval [0, 2π)."
