    "message_2": "To find the distinct number of subgroups for any group of order 20, we can use the Sylow theorems. A group of order 20 has the form 20 = 2^2 * 5^1. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_5 divides 4 and n_5 is congruent to 1 mod 5.\n\nFrom condition 1, n_2 can be 1 or 5. From condition 2, n_5 can be 1 or 4. So, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup.\n2. One Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 5-subgroups.\n3. Five Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 5-subgroup.\n4. Five Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nNow let's analyze these possibilities and see how they help to prove that every group of order 20 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20.\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. Since both are unique, they are normal in the group. The group is then a direct product of these two normal subgroups, which gives us the cyclic group C20 (since 4 and 5 are coprime).\n\n2. One Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 5-subgroups: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, which is normal in the group. However, there are four Sylow 5-subgroups, so none of them are normal. This case corresponds to the dihedral group D10, which has a normal subgroup of order 4 (generated by a rotation) and non-normal subgroups of order 5 (generated by reflections).\n\n3. Five Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 5-subgroup: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, which is normal in the group. However, there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, so none of them are normal. This case corresponds to the non-abelian group of order 20, which has a normal subgroup of order 5 and non-normal subgroups of order 4.\n\n4. Five Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 5-subgroups: In this case, none of the Sylow subgroups are normal, which is not possible since a group of order 20 must have at least one normal subgroup.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 20 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20."
