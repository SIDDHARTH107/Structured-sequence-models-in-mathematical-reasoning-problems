    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after the 10th iteration. So, we plug in the values:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\nLength = 1 * 32\n\nThe length of the Heighway Dragon curve after the 10th iteration is 32."
