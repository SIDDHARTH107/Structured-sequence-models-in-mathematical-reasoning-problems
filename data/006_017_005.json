    "message_1": "A study shows that on a particular road, the probability of a motorcycle accident occurring is 0.05 and the probability of a car accident occurring is 0.1. If there are 20 vehicles on the road, what is the probability that at least one motorcycle accident and one car accident occurs?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of a motorcycle accident as P(M) = 0.05 and the probability of a car accident as P(C) = 0.1. We want to find the probability of at least one motorcycle accident and one car accident occurring.\n\nFirst, we need to find the complementary probabilities, which are the probabilities of no motorcycle accident and no car accident occurring. These are given by:\n\nP(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\nP(not C) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of no motorcycle accident or no car accident occurring among the 20 vehicles. We can calculate these probabilities as:\n\nP(no motorcycle accident among 20 vehicles) = (P(not M))^20 = (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585\nP(no car accident among 20 vehicles) = (P(not C))^20 = (0.9)^20 ≈ 0.3585\n\nTo find the probability of at least one motorcycle accident and one car accident occurring, we can use the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least one M and one C) = 1 - P(no M or no C)\n\nHowever, we need to be careful with the \"or\" part, as it includes the intersection of the two events (no M and no C). We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to account for this:\n\nP(no M or no C) = P(no M) + P(no C) - P(no M and no C)\n\nThe probability of no motorcycle and no car accident occurring among the 20 vehicles is:\n\nP(no M and no C) = (P(not M) * P(not C))^20 = (0.95 * 0.9)^20 ≈ 0.1291\n\nNow we can find the probability of no M or no C:\n\nP(no M or no C) = 0.3585 + 0.3585 - 0.1291 = 0.5879\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least one motorcycle accident and one car accident occurring:\n\nP(at least one M and one C) = 1 - P(no M or no C) = 1 - 0.5879 = 0.4121\n\nSo, the probability of at least one motorcycle accident and one car accident occurring among the 20 vehicles is approximately 0.4121 or 41.21%."
