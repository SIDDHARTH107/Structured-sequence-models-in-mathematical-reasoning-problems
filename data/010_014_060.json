    "message_2": "The Betti numbers of a topological space X are the ranks of its cohomology groups. In this case, we are given the cohomology groups H^0(X), H^1(X), and H^2(X) as isomorphic to certain abelian groups.\n\n1. H^0(X) ≅ Z: This means that the 0th cohomology group is isomorphic to the group of integers Z. The rank of Z is 1, so the 0th Betti number, b_0, is 1.\n\n2. H^1(X) ≅ Z^2: This means that the 1st cohomology group is isomorphic to the direct sum of two copies of the group of integers, Z^2. The rank of Z^2 is 2, so the 1st Betti number, b_1, is 2.\n\n3. H^2(X) ≅ Z: This means that the 2nd cohomology group is isomorphic to the group of integers Z. The rank of Z is 1, so the 2nd Betti number, b_2, is 1.\n\nTherefore, the Betti numbers of the topological space X are b_0 = 1, b_1 = 2, and b_2 = 1."
