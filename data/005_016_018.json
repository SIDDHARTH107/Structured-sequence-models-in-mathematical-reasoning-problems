They collect data on customer demographics and purchase history, and use discriminant analysis to analyze the data. \n\nThe analysis results in the following discriminant function:\n\nD = 2.1X1 + 0.5X2 - 1.8X3 \n\nwhere X1 represents the customer's age, X2 represents their income level, and X3 represents the number of previous purchases they've made from the company.\n\nWhat is the predicted classification of a customer who is 35 years old, has an income of $50,000, and has made 2 previous purchases from the company?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted classification of the customer, we need to plug in the values of X1, X2, and X3 into the discriminant function:\n\nX1 = 35 (age)\nX2 = 50 (income in thousands)\nX3 = 2 (number of previous purchases)\n\nD = 2.1(35) + 0.5(50) - 1.8(2)\n\nD = 73.5 + 25 - 3.6\n\nD = 94.9\n\nThe discriminant score for this customer is 94.9. The predicted classification will depend on the threshold value set by the company for the discriminant function. If the threshold value is higher than 94.9, the customer would be classified as not likely to respond to the marketing campaign. If the threshold value is lower than 94.9, the customer would be classified as likely to respond to the marketing campaign."
