    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+5) - log2(x-1) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this property, we get:\n\nlog2((x+5)/(x-1)) = 3\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property log_a(b) = c is equivalent to a^c = b. In this case, we have:\n\n2^3 = (x+5)/(x-1)\n\n8 = (x+5)/(x-1)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by (x-1):\n\n8(x-1) = x+5\n\n8x - 8 = x + 5\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n7x - 8 = 5\n\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n\n7x = 13\n\nNow, divide by 7:\n\nx = 13/7\n\nSo, the solution is x = 13/7."
