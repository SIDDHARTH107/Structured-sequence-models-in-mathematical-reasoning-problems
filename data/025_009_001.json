    "message_1": "Let C be a smooth algebraic curve of degree 4 in the projective plane with 9 inflection points. What is the dimension of the moduli space of curves in the linear system |C - 2p|, where p is a fixed point on C?",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the moduli space of curves in the linear system |C - 2p|, we first need to compute the dimension of the space of degree 4 curves passing through the given 9 inflection points and then subtract the dimension of the space of curves passing through these points and also containing the point p with multiplicity 2.\n\nLet's denote the degree of the curve as d, which is 4 in this case. The dimension of the space of degree d curves in the projective plane is given by the binomial coefficient (d+2 choose 2) - 1. In our case, this is (6 choose 2) - 1 = 15.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the dimension of the space of curves passing through the 9 inflection points. Since a degree 4 curve has (4 choose 2) = 6 inflection points in general, we have 3 extra conditions imposed by the additional inflection points. Therefore, the dimension of the space of degree 4 curves passing through the 9 inflection points is 15 - 3 = 12.\n\nNext, we need to consider the condition that the curve contains the point p with multiplicity 2. This imposes an additional condition on the curve, so the dimension of the space of curves passing through the 9 inflection points and containing the point p with multiplicity 2 is 12 - 1 = 11.\n\nThus, the dimension of the moduli space of curves in the linear system |C - 2p| is 11."
