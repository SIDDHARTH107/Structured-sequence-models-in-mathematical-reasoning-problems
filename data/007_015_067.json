    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 10,000, we need to find the smallest n such that 2^n - 1 > 10,000 and M_n is prime.\n\nWe can start by testing prime values of n:\n\nn = 11: 2^11 - 1 = 2047 (not prime, divisible by 23)\nn = 13: 2^13 - 1 = 8191 (prime)\n\nSince 8191 is the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 10,000, the answer is 8191."
