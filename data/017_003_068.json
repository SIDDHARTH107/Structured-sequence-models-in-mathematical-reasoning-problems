    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 17. Since 17 is a prime number, we know that the order of G is a prime number as well. We want to show that G is a cyclic group.\n\nRecall that a group is cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be written as a power of g (i.e., G = {g^0, g^1, ..., g^(n-1)} for some integer n).\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary non-identity element a in G. Since G has order 17, the order of a must divide 17. The only divisors of 17 are 1 and 17. If the order of a is 1, then a would be the identity element, which is a contradiction since we assumed a is a non-identity element. Therefore, the order of a must be 17.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by a, denoted as H = <a>. Since the order of a is 17, H has 17 elements. Since H is a subgroup of G and both H and G have the same order (17), we can conclude that H = G.\n\nThus, G is generated by the single element a, which means G is a cyclic group. Therefore, every group of prime order (in this case, order 17) is cyclic."
