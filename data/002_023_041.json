    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (8 cm)²\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 64 cm²\n\nSurface Area ≈ 4 * 3.14 * 64 cm²\n\nSurface Area ≈ 12.56 * 64 cm²\n\nSurface Area ≈ 803.84 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 8 cm is approximately 803.84 cm², rounded to two decimal places."
