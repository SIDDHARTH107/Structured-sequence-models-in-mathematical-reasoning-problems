    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has the order p * q, where p and q are prime numbers. In this case, p = 5 and q = 7. According to the Sylow theorems, we can find the number of Sylow p-subgroups and Sylow q-subgroups in the group.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups and n_q denote the number of Sylow q-subgroups. By Sylow's theorems:\n\n1. n_p divides q and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p)\n2. n_q divides p and n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)\n\nFor n_p:\n\nn_p divides 7, so n_p can be 1 or 7. Since n_p ≡ 1 (mod 5), the only possibility is n_p = 1.\n\nFor n_q:\n\nn_q divides 5, so n_q can be 1 or 5. Since n_q ≡ 1 (mod 7), the only possibility is n_q = 1.\n\nNow, since n_p = n_q = 1, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup. Let's denote these subgroups as P and Q, respectively. P has order 5 and Q has order 7.\n\nSince both P and Q are normal subgroups (as they are the unique Sylow subgroups), their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of the group. Therefore, the group of order 35 is the internal direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to the external direct product of P and Q.\n\nThus, the group of order 35 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 35, which can be represented as Z_35 or C_35 (the integers modulo 35 with addition)."
