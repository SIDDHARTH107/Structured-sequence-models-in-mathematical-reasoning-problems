    "message_2": "To find the Fourier sine series representation of the solution, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation:\n\nu''(x) + 4u(x) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = ±2i\n\nThe general solution of the differential equation is:\n\nu(x) = A*sin(2x) + B*cos(2x)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) u(0) = 0:\n\n0 = A*sin(0) + B*cos(0)\n0 = B\n\nSo, B = 0. The general solution becomes:\n\nu(x) = A*sin(2x)\n\n2) u(pi) = 2:\n\n2 = A*sin(2*pi)\n2 = 0\n\nThis condition cannot be satisfied by any value of A. Therefore, there is no solution to the given boundary value problem in the form of a single sine or cosine function.\n\nHowever, we can still find the Fourier sine series representation of the solution. Let's assume the solution is in the form:\n\nu(x) = ∑(a_n * sin(n*x))\n\nWe need to find the coefficients a_n. Since the given differential equation is homogeneous, we can plug the Fourier sine series into the equation:\n\n∑(a_n * (n^2 * sin(n*x) + 4 * sin(n*x))) = 0\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) u(0) = 0:\n\n0 = ∑(a_n * sin(0))\n\nThis condition is satisfied for all n.\n\n2) u(pi) = 2:\n\n2 = ∑(a_n * sin(n*pi))\n\nSince sin(n*pi) = 0 for all integer values of n, this condition cannot be satisfied by the Fourier sine series representation.\n\nHowever, we can still find an approximate solution by minimizing the error between the desired boundary condition and the actual value of the Fourier sine series at x = pi. This can be done by finding the least squares solution to the problem.\n\nLet's define the error function E(a_n) as:\n\nE(a_n) = (u(pi) - 2)^2\n\nWe want to minimize E(a_n) with respect to the coefficients a_n. To do this, we can differentiate E(a_n) with respect to each a_n and set the result equal to zero:\n\ndE(a_n)/da_n = 0\n\nSolving this equation for each a_n, we can find the Fourier sine series representation of the approximate solution to the boundary value problem. However, this process is beyond the scope of this answer and requires more advanced techniques in functional analysis and optimization."
