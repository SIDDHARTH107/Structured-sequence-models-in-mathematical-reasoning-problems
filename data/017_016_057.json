    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. If n_3 = 3, then there are three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3.\n\nNow, let's determine if G is abelian or not. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, if G is abelian, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C_27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C_9 × C_3 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 3)\n3. C_3 × C_3 × C_3 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to C_27.\nIn this case, G is cyclic, and there is only one subgroup of order 3, which is generated by an element of order 3. So, there is only one subgroup of order 3.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to C_9 × C_3.\nIn this case, there are three subgroups of order 3: one generated by an element of order 3 in the C_9 component, and two generated by elements of order 3 in the C_3 component. So, there are three subgroups of order 3.\n\nCase 3: G is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3 × C_3.\nIn this case, there are 26 non-identity elements in G. Each non-identity element generates a subgroup of order 3. Since each subgroup of order 3 has two non-identity elements, there are 26/2 = 13 subgroups of order 3.\n\nSince we know that there are either 1 or 3 subgroups of order 3, we can eliminate Case 3. Thus, G must be abelian and isomorphic to either C_27 or C_9 × C_3.\n\nIf G has only one subgroup of order 3, then G is isomorphic to C_27. If G has three subgroups of order 3, then G is isomorphic to C_9 × C_3. In either case, G is an abelian group."
