    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the possibilities for G.\n\n1. If G is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to Z_60 (the integers modulo 60 under addition). In this case, G would have a single generator, say g, such that G = {g^0, g^1, ..., g^59}.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to A5 × C2, then G has the structure of the alternating group A5 (even permutations of 5 elements) and the cyclic group C2 (order 2). In this case, G has two generators, say a and b, such that G = {a^i * b^j | 0 ≤ i < 5, 0 ≤ j < 2}.\n\n3. If G is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, then G has a more complex structure that we will need to analyze further.\n\nNow, let's use Sylow's Theorems to analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5, we have the following Sylow subgroups:\n\n- A 2-Sylow subgroup P2 of order 4\n- A 3-Sylow subgroup P3 of order 3\n- A 5-Sylow subgroup P5 of order 5\n\nBy Sylow's Third Theorem, we have:\n\n- The number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n2, divides 3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n- The number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n3, divides 2^2 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n3 can be 1 or 10.\n- The number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n5, divides 2^2 * 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n5 can be 1, 4, or 12.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\n1. If G is cyclic, then there must be a unique 2-Sylow, 3-Sylow, and 5-Sylow subgroup (n2 = n3 = n5 = 1). However, since 60 is not a prime power, G cannot be cyclic.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to A5 × C2, then there must be a unique 5-Sylow subgroup (n5 = 1) and multiple 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups (n2 > 1, n3 > 1). This is consistent with the possibilities for n2, n3, and n5.\n\n3. If G is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, then we need to analyze the possible structures further. However, we can already see that there are possibilities for n2, n3, and n5 that are consistent with this case.\n\nIn conclusion, G cannot be cyclic. It could be isomorphic to A5 × C2 or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. Without more information about G, we cannot determine its exact structure."
