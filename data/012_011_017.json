    "message_2": "To determine the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges, we need to analyze the graph's structure. However, since the graph is not provided, we can only provide a general approach to find the cut vertices and bridges.\n\nA cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nHere is a general approach to find the cut vertices and bridges:\n\n1. Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on the graph. Keep track of the discovery time of each vertex and the lowest discovery time reachable from the subtree rooted at that vertex.\n\n2. A vertex is a cut vertex if it is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, or if it is not the root and has a child v such that there is no back edge from v or any of its descendants to an ancestor of the current vertex.\n\n3. An edge is a bridge if the lowest discovery time reachable from one of its endpoints is greater than the discovery time of the other endpoint.\n\nBy following this approach, you can determine the number of cut vertices and bridges in the given graph G. However, without the specific graph structure, we cannot provide an exact count of cut vertices and bridges."
