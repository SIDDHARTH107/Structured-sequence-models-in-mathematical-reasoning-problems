    "message_1": "A student is standing at point A and looking up at the top of a tree that is located at point B. The distance between point A and point B is 20 meters. If the angle of elevation from point A to the top of the tree is 45 degrees, what is the height of the tree? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance between point A and point B (the adjacent side) is 20 meters. We want to find the height of the tree (the opposite side).\n\ntan(45°) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\ntan(45°) = height of the tree / 20 meters\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height of the tree / 20 meters\n\nTo find the height of the tree, multiply both sides of the equation by 20 meters:\n\nheight of the tree = 20 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree is 20 meters."
