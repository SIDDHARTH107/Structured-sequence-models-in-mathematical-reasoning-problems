    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method. First, let's rewrite the system of equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[  2   3   i |  5 ]\n[  4  -i   6 | -2 ]\n[  3  2i  -5 | -4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We will start by dividing the first row by 2:\n\n```\n[  1  3/2  i/2 |  5/2 ]\n[  4  -i    6 |  -2  ]\n[  3  2i   -5 |  -4  ]\n```\n\nNext, we will eliminate the first element in the second and third rows. To do this, we will subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[  1  3/2  i/2 |  5/2 ]\n[  0 -5i/2  5 | -11/2 ]\n[  0  1/2  -7i/2 | -11/2 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will multiply the third row by 2 to make the second element in the third row equal to 1:\n\n```\n[  1  3/2  i/2 |  5/2 ]\n[  0 -5i/2  5 | -11/2 ]\n[  0   1   -7i | -11   ]\n```\n\nNext, we will eliminate the second element in the first and second rows. To do this, we will subtract 3/2 times the third row from the first row and add 5i/2 times the third row to the second row:\n\n```\n[  1   0  5i/2 |  1/2 ]\n[  0   0  15i | -15  ]\n[  0   1   -7i | -11  ]\n```\n\nNow, we will divide the second row by 15i:\n\n```\n[  1   0  5i/2 |  1/2 ]\n[  0   0   1   |  -1  ]\n[  0   1   -7i | -11  ]\n```\n\nFinally, we will eliminate the third element in the first and third rows. To do this, we will subtract 5i/2 times the second row from the first row and add 7i times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n[  1   0   0   |  3/2 ]\n[  0   0   1   |  -1  ]\n[  0   1   0   | -4   ]\n```\n\nNow, we can read the solutions for x, y, and z from the matrix:\n\nx = 3/2\ny = -4\nz = -1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3/2, y = -4, and z = -1."
