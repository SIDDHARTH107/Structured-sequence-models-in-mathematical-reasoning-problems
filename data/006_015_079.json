    "message_1": "A company's cybersecurity team estimates that the probability of a DDoS attack on their network on any given day is 0.2. What is the probability that they will experience a DDoS attack on at least 3 days out of a 5-day workweek?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (DDoS attacks) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (0.2 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (5 days)\n- k is the number of successes (3, 4, or 5 days with DDoS attacks)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at least 3 days with DDoS attacks, we need to calculate the probabilities for 3, 4, and 5 days and then add them together.\n\n1. Probability of 3 days with DDoS attacks:\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.2^3 * (1-0.2)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.008 * 0.8^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.008 * 0.64\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.0512\n\n2. Probability of 4 days with DDoS attacks:\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.2^4 * (1-0.2)^(5-4)\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.0016 * 0.8\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.0016 * 0.8\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.0064\n\n3. Probability of 5 days with DDoS attacks:\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * 0.2^5 * (1-0.2)^(5-5)\nP(X = 5) = 1 * 0.00032 * 1\nP(X = 5) = 0.00032\n\nNow, we add the probabilities together:\n\nP(at least 3 days) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\nP(at least 3 days) ≈ 0.0512 + 0.0064 + 0.00032\nP(at least 3 days) ≈ 0.05792\n\nSo, the probability of experiencing a DDoS attack on at least 3 days out of a 5-day workweek is approximately 0.05792 or 5.792%."
