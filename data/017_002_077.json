    "message_2": "To show that H must be cyclic, we will use the fact that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 12, the possible orders of H are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We will show that for each of these cases, H is cyclic.\n\n1. If the order of H is 1, then H contains only the identity element, and it is trivially cyclic.\n\n2. If the order of H is 2, then H must contain an element of order 2. In G, the element g^6 has order 2 since (g^6)^2 = g^12 = e (the identity element). So, H = {e, g^6} and is generated by g^6, making H cyclic.\n\n3. If the order of H is 3, then H must contain an element of order 3. In G, the element g^4 has order 3 since (g^4)^3 = g^12 = e. So, H = {e, g^4, g^8} and is generated by g^4, making H cyclic.\n\n4. If the order of H is 4, then H must contain an element of order 4. In G, the element g^3 has order 4 since (g^3)^4 = g^12 = e. So, H = {e, g^3, g^6, g^9} and is generated by g^3, making H cyclic.\n\n5. If the order of H is 6, then H must contain an element of order 6. In G, the element g^2 has order 6 since (g^2)^6 = g^12 = e. So, H = {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10} and is generated by g^2, making H cyclic.\n\n6. If the order of H is 12, then H = G, and since G is cyclic, H is cyclic as well.\n\nIn each case, we have shown that H is cyclic, and we have found a generator for H."
