    "message_1": "Suppose you have a message \"MATHEMATICS\" and you want to encrypt it using Vigenere Cipher with keyword \"MATH\". Determine the encrypted message.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenere Cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we first need to repeat the keyword to match the length of the message:\n\nMessage:   M A T H E M A T I C S\nKeyword:   M A T H M A T H M A T\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square (or tabula recta) to find the encrypted letters. The Vigenere square consists of 26 rows and columns of the alphabet, with each row shifted one position to the left compared to the row above it. To encrypt a letter, we find the intersection of the row corresponding to the message letter and the column corresponding to the keyword letter.\n\nFor example, to encrypt the first letter 'M' with the keyword letter 'M', we find the intersection of the row 'M' and the column 'M', which is 'Y'.\n\nFollowing this process for each letter, we get the encrypted message:\n\nEncrypted: Y M F Q E G Q F K U C\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the Vigenere Cipher with the keyword \"MATH\" is \"YMFQEGQFKUC\"."
