    "message_1": "Let X be a projective curve of degree 4 in the complex projective plane and let L be a line bundle on X. If the degree of L is 3, then what is the value of the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X,L)?",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X,L), we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a curve X of genus g,\n\nh⁰(X,L) - h¹(X,L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nwhere h⁰(X,L) is the dimension of the space of global sections, h¹(X,L) is the dimension of the space of global sections of the dual line bundle, and deg(L) is the degree of the line bundle L.\n\nIn our case, the curve X has degree 4, so its genus can be computed using the formula:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. Plugging in d = 4, we get:\n\ng = (4 - 1)(4 - 2)/2 = 3(2)/2 = 3\n\nNow, we are given that the degree of the line bundle L is 3. So, we can plug this information into the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh⁰(X,L) - h¹(X,L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\nh⁰(X,L) - h¹(X,L) = 3 + 1 - 3\nh⁰(X,L) - h¹(X,L) = 1\n\nSince h¹(X,L) is non-negative, the only possibility is that h¹(X,L) = 0, which implies that h⁰(X,L) = 1. Therefore, the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X,L) is 1."
