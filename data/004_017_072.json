    "message_1": "A curve is defined by the equation y = x^(3/2) between x = 0 and x = 4. What is the length of this curve?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nArc length = ∫[√(1 + (dy/dx)^2)] dx from a to b\n\nHere, a = 0 and b = 4. First, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we'll plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nArc length = ∫[√(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2)] dx from 0 to 4\n\nArc length = ∫[√(1 + (9/4)x)] dx from 0 to 4\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + (9/4)x, then du/dx = 9/4, and dx = (4/9)du.\n\nThe limits of integration will also change. When x = 0, u = 1, and when x = 4, u = 1 + (9/4)(4) = 1 + 9 = 10.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nArc length = ∫[√(u)] * (4/9) du from 1 to 10\n\nArc length = (4/9) * ∫[u^(1/2)] du from 1 to 10\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nArc length = (4/9) * [(2/3)u^(3/2)] from 1 to 10\n\nArc length = (8/27) * [10^(3/2) - 1^(3/2)]\n\nArc length = (8/27) * (10√10 - 1)\n\nArc length ≈ 29.86\n\nSo, the length of the curve is approximately 29.86 units."
