    "message_2": "Since the given signal x(t) is already a sum of cosines, it is already in the Fourier series representation. The Fourier series representation of x(t) is:\n\n$$x(t) = \\cos(4\\pi t) + \\cos(10\\pi t)$$\n\nThe frequency components of the signal are given by the arguments of the cosine functions. In this case, the frequency components are:\n\n$$f_1 = \\frac{4\\pi}{2\\pi} = 2 \\,\\text{Hz}$$\n$$f_2 = \\frac{10\\pi}{2\\pi} = 5 \\,\\text{Hz}$$\n\nNow, let's compute the amplitude and phase spectrum of the signal x(t) using the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{\\cos(2\\pi ft)\\} = \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta(f - f_0) + \\delta(f + f_0)]$$\n\nwhere $\\delta(f)$ is the Dirac delta function and $f_0$ is the frequency of the cosine function.\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to x(t), we get:\n\n$$X(f) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta(f - 2) + \\delta(f + 2)] + \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta(f - 5) + \\delta(f + 5)]$$\n\nThe amplitude spectrum is given by the magnitude of the Fourier transform:\n\n$$|X(f)| = \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta(f - 2) + \\delta(f + 2) + \\delta(f - 5) + \\delta(f + 5)]$$\n\nThe phase spectrum is given by the phase angle of the Fourier transform. Since all the components are real and positive, the phase spectrum is:\n\n$$\\angle X(f) = 0$$ for all frequency components.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series representation of the signal x(t) is:\n\n$$x(t) = \\cos(4\\pi t) + \\cos(10\\pi t)$$\n\nwith frequency components 2 Hz and 5 Hz. The amplitude spectrum is given by:\n\n$$|X(f)| = \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta(f - 2) + \\delta(f + 2) + \\delta(f - 5) + \\delta(f + 5)]$$\n\nand the phase spectrum is 0 for all frequency components."
