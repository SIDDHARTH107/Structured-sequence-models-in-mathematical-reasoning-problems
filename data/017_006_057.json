    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let the order of G be 35 = 5^1 * 7^1.\n\nAccording to the first Sylow theorem, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nNow, we will use the third Sylow theorem. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted by n_5, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, denoted by n_7, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus, n_7 divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nSince n_5 = n_7 = 1, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup in G. Let P and Q be these unique subgroups. Since P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G (by the second Sylow theorem).\n\nNow, consider the product of elements from P and Q. For any p ∈ P and q ∈ Q, we have:\n\n(pq)(qp) = p(qq^{-1})p = p(p^{-1}q^{-1}p) = (pp^{-1})(q^{-1}p) = q^{-1}p\n\nSince P and Q are normal in G, this implies that pq = qp. Therefore, the elements of P and Q commute with each other.\n\nNow, consider the set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Since |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, we have |PQ| = 35. Moreover, since P and Q are normal in G, PQ is a subgroup of G (by the product of normal subgroups theorem). Since |PQ| = |G|, we have PQ = G.\n\nThus, G is the internal direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nAlternatively, if there exists an element g ∈ G with order 35, then G is a cyclic group generated by g and isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 35. In either case, G is isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 35 or the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
