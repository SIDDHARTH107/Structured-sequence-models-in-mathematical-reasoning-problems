    "message_2": "To find the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern, we need to consider the iterative process described. Let's denote the size of the shape at iteration n as S_n. According to the problem, we have:\n\nS_n = (S_(n-1) / 2) + 0.05\n\nNow, let's find the scaling factor, which we'll call k. The scaling factor is the ratio of the size of the shape at iteration n to the size of the shape at iteration (n-1):\n\nk = S_n / S_(n-1)\n\nWe can rewrite this equation using the relationship given in the problem:\n\nk = ((S_(n-1) / 2) + 0.05) / S_(n-1)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nk = (1/2) + (0.05 / S_(n-1))\n\nSince we are looking for a general scaling factor, we can't provide an exact value without knowing the size of the shape at a specific iteration (S_(n-1)). However, the scaling factor will depend on the size of the previous shape and will be in the form:\n\nk = (1/2) + (0.05 / S_(n-1))"
