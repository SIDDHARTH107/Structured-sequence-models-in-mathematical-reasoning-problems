    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate components in the graph.\n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles and has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. To minimize the number of edges to be removed, we can try to create two trees from the given graph.\n\nLet's consider the two trees to have a and b vertices respectively, where a + b = 7 (since there are 7 vertices in total). To minimize the number of edges, we should try to balance the number of vertices in the two trees. So, let's consider a = 3 and b = 4.\n\nNow, the first tree with 3 vertices will have 3-1 = 2 edges, and the second tree with 4 vertices will have 4-1 = 3 edges. Therefore, the total number of edges in the two trees will be 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSince the original graph has 9 edges, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph is 9 - 5 = 4."
