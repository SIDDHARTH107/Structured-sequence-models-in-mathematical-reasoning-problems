    "message_1": "A cable that weighs 5 N/m is suspended between two poles that are 10 meters apart. If the cable takes on the shape of a parabolic curve, what is the maximum height of the cable above the ground?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the equation of the parabolic curve that the cable takes on. Since the cable is suspended between two poles, we can assume that the parabolic curve is symmetric about the midpoint between the poles. Let's denote the x-axis as the ground and the y-axis as the height above the ground.\n\nThe two poles are located at points A (0, 0) and B (10, 0). The midpoint between the poles is at point C (5, h), where h is the maximum height of the cable above the ground.\n\nThe equation of a parabolic curve can be written in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. Since the parabolic curve passes through points A, B, and C, we can write the following system of equations:\n\n1) 0 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c\n2) 0 = a(10)^2 + b(10) + c\n3) h = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c\n\nFrom equation 1, we get c = 0. Now, we can rewrite equations 2 and 3 as:\n\n2) 0 = 100a + 10b\n3) h = 25a + 5b\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by multiplying equation 3 by 2 and subtracting equation 2:\n\n2h = 50a + 10b\n100a + 10b = 2h\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between the weight of the cable (5 N/m) and the maximum height (h). The weight of the cable creates a force that pulls the cable downward, causing it to sag. The force acting on the cable is proportional to the square of the height (h^2). Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n5 = k * h^2\n\nWhere k is a constant of proportionality. To find the value of k, we can use the fact that the total weight of the cable is 50 N (5 N/m * 10 m):\n\n50 = k * h^2\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh^2 = 50 / k\nh = sqrt(50 / k)\n\nSince we have found the relationship between h and k, we can substitute this expression into our equation for the parabolic curve:\n\ny = ax^2 + bx\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the parabolic curve is symmetric about the midpoint between the poles to find the maximum height of the cable above the ground:\n\nymax = a(5)^2 + b(5)\nymax = 25a + 5b\n\nSubstituting the expression for h:\n\nymax = sqrt(50 / k)\n\nTo find the maximum height of the cable above the ground, we need to find the value of k that satisfies this equation. Unfortunately, this problem does not provide enough information to determine the value of k. However, we can express the maximum height of the cable above the ground in terms of k:\n\nymax = sqrt(50 / k)"
