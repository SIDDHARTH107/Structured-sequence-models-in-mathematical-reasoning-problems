    "message_2": "A cut vertex (articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph.\n2. For each vertex, calculate its discovery time and low value.\n3. A vertex is a cut vertex if:\n   a. It is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children.\n   b. It is not the root of the DFS tree and has a child whose low value is greater than or equal to the discovery time of the vertex.\n4. An edge is a bridge if the low value of the adjacent vertex is greater than the discovery time of the current vertex.\n\nApplying the algorithm to the given graph, we get the following cut vertices and bridges:\n\nCut vertices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'E']\nBridges: [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'E')]\n\nTotal number of cut vertices: 4\nTotal number of bridges: 3"
