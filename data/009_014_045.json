The initial population size is 100, and the population grows at a rate of 100 per day. Write the differential equation that models the population growth and find the population after 5 days.",
    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = r * P * (1 - P/K)\n\nwhere P is the population size, r is the growth rate, K is the carrying capacity, and t is time.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the carrying capacity K = 2000, the initial population size P(0) = 100, and the growth rate r = 100 per day.\n\nFirst, let's write the differential equation with the given values:\n\ndP/dt = 100 * P * (1 - P/2000)\n\nTo find the population after 5 days, we need to solve this differential equation. We can do this by separating variables and integrating both sides:\n\n∫(1/(P * (1 - P/2000))) dP = ∫100 dt\n\nLet's make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let u = 1 - P/2000, then -dP/2000 = du:\n\n∫(-2000/(P * u)) du = ∫100 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n-2000 * ∫(1/P) du = 100 * ∫dt\n\n-2000 * ln|P| = 100t + C₁\n\nNow, solve for P:\n\nln|P| = (-1/20)t + C₂, where C₂ = C₁/(-2000)\n\nP(t) = e^((-1/20)t + C₂)\n\nTo find the constant C₂, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 100:\n\n100 = e^(C₂)\n\nC₂ = ln(100)\n\nNow we have the equation for the population as a function of time:\n\nP(t) = e^((-1/20)t + ln(100))\n\nTo find the population after 5 days, plug in t = 5:\n\nP(5) = e^((-1/20)(5) + ln(100))\n\nP(5) = e^(ln(100) - 1/4)\n\nP(5) = 100 * e^(-1/4)\n\nP(5) ≈ 100 * 0.7788\n\nP(5) ≈ 77.88 * 100\n\nP(5) ≈ 778.8\n\nAfter 5 days, the population is approximately 778.8 bacteria."
