    "message_2": "To show that S is conformally equivalent to the unit disc, we will construct an explicit conformal map that sends S to the unit disc. Let's denote the unit disc as D.\n\nFirst, we need to map the punctured complex plane S to the complex plane without the point at infinity. We can do this by using the following Möbius transformation:\n\nf(z) = (z - 3) / (z + 3)\n\nThis transformation maps 3 to 0 and ∞ to 1. Now, we have a complex plane punctured at 0 and 1.\n\nNext, we want to map this punctured plane to the unit disc D. We can use the following transformation:\n\ng(z) = z / (z - 1)\n\nThis transformation maps 0 to 0 and 1 to ∞. Now, we have a complex plane punctured at 0 and ∞.\n\nFinally, we can use the Cayley transform to map this punctured plane to the unit disc:\n\nh(z) = (z - i) / (z + i)\n\nThis transformation maps 0 to -1 and ∞ to 1, and the unit disc is the image of the complex plane under this transformation.\n\nNow, we can combine these transformations to obtain the conformal map that sends S to the unit disc:\n\nF(z) = h(g(f(z))) = h(g((z - 3) / (z + 3))) = h(((z - 3) / (z + 3)) / (((z - 3) / (z + 3)) - 1)) = h((z - 3) / (2z))\n\nNow, let's simplify F(z):\n\nF(z) = ((z - 3) / (2z) - i) / ((z - 3) / (2z) + i) = ((z - 3) - 2zi) / ((z - 3) + 2zi)\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\nF(z) = (((z - 3) - 2zi) * ((z - 3) - 2zi)) / (((z - 3) + 2zi) * ((z - 3) - 2zi)) = ((z - 3)^2 + 4z^2) / (z^2 + 6z + 13)\n\nThus, the conformal map F(z) that sends S to the unit disc is given by:\n\nF(z) = ((z - 3)^2 + 4z^2) / (z^2 + 6z + 13)"
