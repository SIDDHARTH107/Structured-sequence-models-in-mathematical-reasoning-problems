Show all your work and clearly state the final solution in the form (x, y, z).",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 3  2  1 | 8 |\n| 2 -1  4 | 3 |\n| 1  3 -2 | 0 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nWe'll use the first row as the pivot row. Multiply the first row by -2/3 and add it to the second row. Then, multiply the first row by -1/3 and add it to the third row.\n\n```\n| 3    2    1 |  8  |\n| 0 -5/3 10/3 | -1  |\n| 0  7/3 -5/3 | -8/3|\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nWe'll use the second row as the pivot row. Multiply the second row by -7/5 and add it to the third row.\n\n```\n| 3    2    1 |  8  |\n| 0 -5/3 10/3 | -1  |\n| 0    0   -1 | -3  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Back substitution.\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back substitution to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have: -z = -3, so z = 3.\n\nFrom the second row, we have: -5/3y + 10/3(3) = -1, so y = 1.\n\nFrom the first row, we have: 3x + 2(1) + 3 = 8, so x = 1.\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 3)."
