    "message_1": "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with defining equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 3$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $\\Theta_E(z)$ be its associated Riemann theta function. Find the coefficient of $q^{19}$ in the Fourier expansion of $\\Theta_E(z)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi iz}$ is the modular invariant.",
    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of $q^{19}$ in the Fourier expansion of $\\Theta_E(z)$, we first need to determine the period lattice of the elliptic curve $E$. The period lattice is given by $\\Lambda = \\{m\\omega_1 + n\\omega_2 : m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, where $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are the periods of $E$.\n\nThe periods of an elliptic curve can be computed using the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function and its derivatives. For the given elliptic curve $E$, the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function is defined as:\n\n$\\wp(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2} + \\sum_{(m,n) \\neq (0,0)} \\left(\\frac{1}{(z - m\\omega_1 - n\\omega_2)^2} - \\frac{1}{(m\\omega_1 + n\\omega_2)^2}\\right)$.\n\nThe periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ can be found by solving the system of equations:\n\n$\\wp(\\omega_1) = x_1$ and $\\wp(\\omega_2) = x_2$,\n\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the cubic equation $x^3 + 2x + 3 = 0$. Solving this equation, we find that $x_1 \\approx -1.5321$, $x_2 \\approx 0.7660 + 1.8489i$, and $x_3 \\approx 0.7660 - 1.8489i$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Riemann theta function $\\Theta_E(z)$ as:\n\n$\\Theta_E(z) = \\sum_{(m,n) \\in \\Lambda} q^{m^2\\omega_1^2 + 2mn\\omega_1\\omega_2 + n^2\\omega_2^2}$.\n\nTo find the coefficient of $q^{19}$, we need to find all pairs $(m,n) \\in \\Lambda$ such that $m^2\\omega_1^2 + 2mn\\omega_1\\omega_2 + n^2\\omega_2^2 = 19$. This is a Diophantine equation, and solving it can be quite challenging.\n\nHowever, we can use the Lattice Reduction Algorithm (such as the LLL algorithm) to find a reduced basis for the lattice $\\Lambda$. This will give us a smaller set of vectors to search for pairs $(m,n)$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nOnce we find all such pairs $(m,n)$, the coefficient of $q^{19}$ in the Fourier expansion of $\\Theta_E(z)$ will be the sum of the corresponding terms in the theta function:\n\n$c_{19} = \\sum_{(m,n) \\in S} q^{m^2\\omega_1^2 + 2mn\\omega_1\\omega_2 + n^2\\omega_2^2}$,\n\nwhere $S$ is the set of all pairs $(m,n)$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nIn general, finding the Fourier coefficients of Riemann theta functions for elliptic curves is a difficult problem, and there is no closed-form expression for the coefficients. However, the Lattice Reduction Algorithm and other numerical methods can be used to approximate the coefficients for specific cases."
