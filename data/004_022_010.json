    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical optimization problem with constraints for a math student to solve using calculus:\n\nA company manufactures two products: Product A and Product B. Producing Product A requires 2 hours of Machine X's time and 3 hours of Machine Y's time, while producing Product B requires 4 hours of Machine X's time and 5 hours of Machine Y's time. The company has a total of 24 hours of Machine X's time and 30 hours of Machine Y's time available per day. Product A generates a profit of $5 per unit while Product B generates a profit of $8 per unit. \n\nWhat should be the optimal number of units of each product to manufacture per day in order to maximize the daily profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 8y, subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 24 (Machine X's time)\n3x + 5y ≤ 30 (Machine Y's time)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity)\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the constraints as:\n\ny ≤ (24 - 2x) / 4 = 6 - 0.5x (Machine X's time)\ny ≤ (30 - 3x) / 5 = 6 - 0.6x (Machine Y's time)\n\nNow, we can graph these constraints and find the feasible region. The feasible region is a convex polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 6), (4, 3), and (10, 0). Since the profit function P(x, y) is linear, the maximum value will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nLet's evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\nP(0, 6) = 5(0) + 8(6) = 48\nP(4, 3) = 5(4) + 8(3) = 20 + 24 = 44\nP(10, 0) = 5(10) + 8(0) = 50\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 10 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B, with a daily profit of $50."
