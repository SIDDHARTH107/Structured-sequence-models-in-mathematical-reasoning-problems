    "message_1": "Bob wants to send a secret message \"HELLO\" to Alice using one-time pad encryption. The key that Bob and Alice are using is a sequence of 5 random numbers from 1 to 26. The numbers in the key are (3, 9, 12, 17, 24).\n\na) Convert the message to numbers using the A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26 convention and write down the resulting sequence.\n\nb) Encrypt the message by adding the numbers in the key modulo 26. Write down the resulting sequence.\n\nc) Send the encrypted message to Alice.\n\nd) If an eavesdropper intercepts the message, what is the probability that they will be able to guess the original message correctly?",
    "message_2": "a) Converting the message \"HELLO\" to numbers using the A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26 convention, we get the sequence:\nH=8, E=5, L=12, L=12, O=15, so the sequence is (8, 5, 12, 12, 15).\n\nb) Encrypt the message by adding the numbers in the key modulo 26:\n(8+3) mod 26 = 11,\n(5+9) mod 26 = 14,\n(12+12) mod 26 = 24,\n(12+17) mod 26 = 3,\n(15+24) mod 26 = 13.\n\nThe resulting encrypted sequence is (11, 14, 24, 3, 13).\n\nc) Send the encrypted message (11, 14, 24, 3, 13) to Alice.\n\nd) If an eavesdropper intercepts the message, they would have to guess the correct key to decrypt the message. Since there are 26 possibilities for each number in the key, there are 26^5 = 11,881,376 possible keys. The eavesdropper has a 1 in 11,881,376 chance of guessing the correct key and decrypting the message, so the probability is approximately 8.42 x 10^-8 (very close to zero)."
