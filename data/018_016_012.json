    "message_2": "Let's find the Cartesian products and unions for the given sets:\n\n1. A × B ∪ B × A\nFirst, we find the Cartesian product of A and B:\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNext, we find the Cartesian product of B and A:\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, we find the union of these two sets:\nA × B ∪ B × A = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n2. B × A ∪ A × B\nWe have already found the Cartesian products of B × A and A × B. Now, we find the union of these sets:\nB × A ∪ A × B = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nComparing the two sets:\n\nA × B ∪ B × A = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\nB × A ∪ A × B = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nWe can see that both sets are equal to each other:\n\nA × B ∪ B × A = B × A ∪ A × B\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is commutative with respect to union. My previous statement was incorrect, and I apologize for the confusion."
