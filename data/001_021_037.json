    "message_2": "To solve the equation x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x = 0, we can first factor out the common factor x:\n\nx(x^2 - 4x + 4) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx(x - 2)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, we have three factors: x, (x - 2), and (x - 2). To find the values of x that satisfy the equation, we set each factor equal to zero:\n\n1) x = 0\n2) x - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n3) x - 2 = 0 => x = 2 (same as the second factor)\n\nThus, the solutions for x are x = 0 and x = 2."
