Let's assume that there exists a 1-parameter family of contactomorphisms $\\{\\phi_t\\}_{t\\in[0,1]}$ of $M$ that preserves the contact form $\\alpha$. If $\\phi_0=\\mathrm{id}_M$ (the identity map on $M$) and $\\phi_1(p)=q$ for some points $p,q\\in M$, find the Conley-Zehnder index of the path $\\tilde{\\phi}_t\\colon T_pM\\to T_qM$ defined by $\\tilde{\\phi}_t(v)=d\\phi_t(v)$ for all $t\\in[0,1]$. Assume that the periodic orbits of the Reeb vector field of $(M,\\alpha)$ are non-degenerate.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Conley-Zehnder index of the path $\\tilde{\\phi}_t\\colon T_pM\\to T_qM$, we first need to understand the linearized dynamics of the contactomorphism $\\phi_t$ along the path. Since $\\phi_t$ preserves the contact form $\\alpha$, we know that the Reeb vector field $R_\\alpha$ is also preserved, i.e., $\\phi_t^*R_\\alpha = R_\\alpha$. \n\nNow, let's consider the symplectic linearization of the contact structure. The contact structure on $M$ can be identified with the kernel of the contact form, i.e., $\\xi = \\ker \\alpha$. Since $\\phi_t$ preserves $\\alpha$, it also preserves $\\xi$. Therefore, the tangent spaces $T_pM$ and $T_qM$ can be decomposed into the direct sum of the contact distribution $\\xi_p$ and $\\xi_q$, respectively, and the Reeb vector fields $R_\\alpha(p)$ and $R_\\alpha(q)$. \n\nThe linearized contactomorphism $\\tilde{\\phi}_t$ maps $\\xi_p$ to $\\xi_q$ and $R_\\alpha(p)$ to $R_\\alpha(q)$. We can restrict $\\tilde{\\phi}_t$ to the contact distribution, obtaining a path of linear symplectic maps $\\tilde{\\phi}_t|_{\\xi_p} \\colon \\xi_p \\to \\xi_q$. The Conley-Zehnder index of this path is the quantity we want to compute.\n\nTo compute the Conley-Zehnder index, we need to find a symplectic trivialization of the contact distribution along the path. This means finding a continuous family of symplectic bases $\\{e_1(t), e_2(t)\\}$ for $\\xi_p$ and $\\xi_q$ such that $\\tilde{\\phi}_t(e_1(0)) = e_1(1)$ and $\\tilde{\\phi}_t(e_2(0)) = e_2(1)$. \n\nOnce we have the symplectic trivialization, we can compute the Conley-Zehnder index by finding the winding number of the path of linear symplectic maps with respect to this trivialization. The winding number is an integer that measures the number of times the path of linear symplectic maps winds around the space of all linear symplectic maps.\n\nIn general, the Conley-Zehnder index depends on the choice of trivialization, but its parity (i.e., whether it is even or odd) is independent of the choice. Therefore, we can compute the Conley-Zehnder index modulo 2 without finding an explicit trivialization.\n\nTo compute the Conley-Zehnder index modulo 2, we can use the Maslov index, which is a homotopy invariant of the path of Lagrangian subspaces associated with the path of linear symplectic maps. In our case, the Maslov index of the path $\\tilde{\\phi}_t|_{\\xi_p}$ is equal to the Conley-Zehnder index modulo 2.\n\nThe Maslov index can be computed using the intersection properties of the Lagrangian subspaces along the path. In our case, since the periodic orbits of the Reeb vector field are non-degenerate, the Maslov index is well-defined and can be computed explicitly.\n\nIn summary, to compute the Conley-Zehnder index of the path $\\tilde{\\phi}_t\\colon T_pM\\to T_qM$, we need to find a symplectic trivialization of the contact distribution along the path and compute the winding number of the path of linear symplectic maps with respect to this trivialization. Alternatively, we can compute the Conley-Zehnder index modulo 2 using the Maslov index, which is a homotopy invariant of the path of Lagrangian subspaces associated with the path of linear symplectic maps."
