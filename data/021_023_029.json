    "message_1": "An engineering company is designing a rectangular storage container with a fixed volume of 200 cubic meters. The material cost for the bottom and sides of the container is ₱150 per square meter and for the top is ₱200 per square meter. Using grey wolf optimizer, find the dimensions (length, width, and height) of the container that will minimize the cost of the material. Assume that the container has no top, and that its length is twice its width.",
    "message_2": "Since the container has no top, we only need to consider the cost of the bottom and sides. Let's denote the width as w, the length as l, and the height as h. Given that the length is twice the width, we have l = 2w. The volume of the container is given by V = l * w * h, and we know that V = 200 cubic meters.\n\nFirst, let's express h in terms of w using the volume equation:\n\n200 = (2w) * w * h\n200 = 2w^2 * h\n\nh = 100 / w^2\n\nNow, let's find the surface area of the container (bottom and sides):\n\nA = lw + 2lh + 2wh\nA = (2w)w + 2(2w)(100 / w^2) + 2w(100 / w^2)\nA = 2w^2 + 400/w + 200/w\n\nThe cost function C can be calculated by multiplying the surface area by the cost per square meter (₱150):\n\nC = 150 * (2w^2 + 400/w + 200/w)\nC = 300w^2 + 60000/w + 30000/w\n\nTo minimize the cost, we can use the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm. However, GWO is a complex optimization algorithm that cannot be easily explained or calculated by hand. Instead, we can use calculus to find the minimum cost.\n\nTake the derivative of the cost function with respect to w:\n\ndC/dw = 600w - 60000/w^2 - 30000/w^2\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for w:\n\n0 = 600w - 60000/w^2 - 30000/w^2\n\nCombining the terms:\n\n0 = 600w^3 - 60000w - 30000w\n0 = 600w(w^2 - 100)\n\nThe width w can be found by solving the equation w^2 - 100 = 0:\n\nw^2 = 100\nw = 10\n\nNow, we can find the length and height:\n\nl = 2w = 2 * 10 = 20\nh = 100 / w^2 = 100 / (10^2) = 1\n\nSo, the dimensions of the container that will minimize the cost of the material are width = 10 meters, length = 20 meters, and height = 1 meter."
