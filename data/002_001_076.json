    "message_1": "Determine the area of a triangle whose base measures 8 cm and whose height measures 12 cm.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 cm × 12 cm) / 2\nArea = (96 cm²) / 2\nArea = 48 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 48 square centimeters."
