    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem based on Prisoner's Dilemma in game theory:\n\nTwo criminals, A and B, are caught by the police and placed in separate interrogation rooms. They are each given two choices: either to confess or to remain silent. If both remain silent, they will be sentenced to 1 year in prison each. If one confesses and the other remains silent, the one who confessed will get a 6-month sentence and the other will get a 10-year sentence. If both confess, they will each get a 5-year sentence.\n\nAssuming that they cannot communicate with each other and do not know what the other will do, what is the best strategy for each criminal to minimize their sentence?\n\nPlease show your calculations and provide the best outcome for each criminal based on their strategy.",
    "message_2": "To find the best strategy for each criminal, we need to analyze the possible outcomes for each choice they make. We can create a payoff matrix to represent the possible outcomes:\n\n```\n          Criminal B\n          | Silent  | Confess\nCriminal A|---------|---------\nSilent    | (1, 1)  | (10, 0.5)\n          |---------|---------\nConfess   | (0.5, 10)| (5, 5)\n```\n\nIn this matrix, the first number in each pair represents the sentence for Criminal A, and the second number represents the sentence for Criminal B.\n\nNow, let's analyze the best strategy for each criminal:\n\n1. If Criminal A believes that Criminal B will remain silent, then A's best strategy is to confess, as they will get a 6-month sentence (0.5 years) instead of a 1-year sentence.\n\n2. If Criminal A believes that Criminal B will confess, then A's best strategy is also to confess, as they will get a 5-year sentence instead of a 10-year sentence.\n\nThe same logic applies to Criminal B's decision-making process.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy for each criminal, given that they cannot communicate and do not know what the other will do, is to confess. This results in both criminals receiving a 5-year sentence, which is the Nash equilibrium in this game. The Nash equilibrium is a stable state where no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy."
