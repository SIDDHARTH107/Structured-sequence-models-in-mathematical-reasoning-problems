    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in years.\n\nFirst, we need to find the growth rate r. We know that the population triples every 5 years, so:\n\nP(5) = 3 * P0\n\nUsing the exponential growth formula, we can write:\n\n3 * P0 = P0 * (1 + r)^5\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n3 = (1 + r)^5\n\nNow, take the 5th root of both sides:\n\n3^(1/5) = 1 + r\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides to find r:\n\nr = 3^(1/5) - 1 ≈ 0.245\n\nNow that we have the growth rate, we can find the population after 15 years:\n\nP(15) = P0 * (1 + r)^15\n\nP(15) = 200 * (1 + 0.245)^15\n\nP(15) ≈ 200 * 9.000\n\nP(15) ≈ 1800\n\nSo, the population after 15 years will be approximately 1800 rabbits."
