    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 tosses, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (tosses)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (heads)\n- p is the probability of success (getting a head)\n- q is the probability of failure (getting a tail)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 5, k = 3, p = 0.5 (since it's a fair coin), and q = 0.5.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of combinations of 5 tosses taken 3 at a time:\n\n5C3 = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n= 5! / (3!2!)\n= (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n= (5 × 4) / (2 × 1)\n= 10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = (10) * (0.5^3) * (0.5^(5-3))\n= 10 * (0.125) * (0.25)\n= 10 * 0.03125\n= 0.3125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 tosses of a fair coin is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
