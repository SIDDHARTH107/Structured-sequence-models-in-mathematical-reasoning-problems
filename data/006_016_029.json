    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring is 0.05. If 500 products are produced, what is the expected number of defective products?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of defective products, we can multiply the probability of a defect occurring by the total number of products produced.\n\nExpected number of defective products = Probability of defect * Total number of products\nExpected number of defective products = 0.05 * 500\nExpected number of defective products = 25\n\nSo, the expected number of defective products is 25."
