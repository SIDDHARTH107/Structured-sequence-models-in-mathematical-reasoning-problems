    "message_2": "Let G be a group with 4 elements, and let its elements be {e, a, b, c}. We know that e is the identity element. We will consider the possible orders of the elements a, b, and c, and show that G must be isomorphic to either C4 or V4.\n\nCase 1: There exists an element of order 4.\nWithout loss of generality, let the order of a be 4. Then, a^4 = e, and the distinct powers of a are {e, a, a^2, a^3}. Thus, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}. This means that G is a cyclic group generated by a, and G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements have order 2.\nIn this case, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. We will show that G is isomorphic to V4, which has elements {e, x, y, z} such that x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = e and xy = z, yz = x, zx = y.\n\nSince a^2 = e, we can let a = x. Now, we need to find an element in G that can play the role of y. Since b^2 = e, we can try letting b = y. Then, we have:\n\nab = c (since it's the only remaining element in G)\nba = c (since G is a group and ab has an inverse, which must be a^(-1)b^(-1) = ba)\n\nNow, we can check if c satisfies the properties of z in V4:\n\nc^2 = (ab)^2 = abab = a(ba)b = a(ab)b = a^2b^2 = e\nac = a(ab) = a^2b = b\nbc = (ab)c = a(bc) = a^2c = c\nca = c(ab) = (ca)b = cb = b\n\nThus, G = {e, a, b, c} is isomorphic to V4 = {e, x, y, z} with the isomorphism given by e -> e, a -> x, b -> y, and c -> z.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group with 4 elements, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
