    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence of values converges or diverges, we can use the concept of the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0.\n\nThe criterion for a point to be in the Mandelbrot set is that the absolute value of the iterated function should not exceed a certain threshold (usually 2) after a large number of iterations.\n\nLet's iterate the function f(z) = z^2 + c with the given value of c and z = 0:\n\n1. f(0) = 0^2 - 0.726895347709114071439 = -0.726895347709114071439\n2. f(-0.726895347709114071439) = (-0.726895347709114071439)^2 - 0.726895347709114071439 ≈ 0.073684\n3. f(0.073684) ≈ 0.073684^2 - 0.726895347709114071439 ≈ -0.671073\n4. f(-0.671073) ≈ (-0.671073)^2 - 0.726895347709114071439 ≈ -0.276048\n5. f(-0.276048) ≈ (-0.276048)^2 - 0.726895347709114071439 ≈ -0.653746\n\nWe can continue iterating, but it seems that the sequence is not diverging to infinity nor converging to a single point. However, the absolute value of the iterated function is not exceeding the threshold of 2. This suggests that the point c = -0.726895347709114071439 is likely within the Mandelbrot set, and the sequence does not diverge to infinity."
