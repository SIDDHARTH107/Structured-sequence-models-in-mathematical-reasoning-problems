    "message_2": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots, counting multiplicity. In this case, the polynomial p(z) = 5z³ + 8z² − 2z + 7 has degree 3, so it has exactly 3 complex roots.\n\nTo determine the number of roots inside the unit disk centered at the origin, we can use Liouville's theorem. Liouville's theorem states that a bounded entire function (a function that is holomorphic on the entire complex plane) must be constant. \n\nConsider the function g(z) = 1/p(z). If |z| > 1, then |5z³| > |8z² - 2z + 7|. Therefore, |p(z)| > |5z³| - |8z² - 2z + 7| > |5z³| - (|8z²| + |2z| + |7|). Since |z| > 1, we have |5z³| > 5, |8z²| > 8, |2z| > 2, and |7| = 7. Thus, |p(z)| > 5 - (8 + 2 + 7) = -12. However, this is a contradiction, as |p(z)| must be positive.\n\nTherefore, g(z) cannot be bounded on the region |z| > 1, which means that g(z) must have a pole (i.e., a root of p(z)) inside the unit disk. Since p(z) has exactly 3 roots, and at least one of them is inside the unit disk, there are either 1 or 2 roots inside the unit disk.\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomial p(1/z). If z is a root of p(z) inside the unit disk, then 1/z is a root of p(1/z) outside the unit disk. The polynomial p(1/z) is given by:\n\np(1/z) = 5(1/z)³ + 8(1/z)² - 2(1/z) + 7\n       = 5/z³ + 8/z² - 2/z + 7\n\nSince p(1/z) has the same degree as p(z), it also has 3 roots. We know that at least one of these roots is outside the unit disk. If there were 2 roots of p(z) inside the unit disk, then there would be 2 roots of p(1/z) outside the unit disk, which would mean that p(1/z) has a root at z = 0. However, p(1/0) is not defined, so this is not possible.\n\nThus, there must be exactly 1 root of p(z) inside the unit disk."
