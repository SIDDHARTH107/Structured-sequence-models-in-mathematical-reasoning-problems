    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to reverse the Caesar cipher by shifting the letters back by the same amount they were shifted forward. In this case, the shift is 3 letters (A -> D, B -> E, etc.).\n\nSo, we will shift each letter in the encrypted message \"GCUA VQ DTGCM\" back by 3 positions:\n\nG -> D\nC -> Z\nU -> R\nA -> X\n\nV -> S\nQ -> N\n\nD -> A\nT -> Q\nG -> D\nC -> Z\nM -> J\n\nThe decrypted message is \"DZRX SN AQDZJ\"."
