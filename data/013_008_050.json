    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, three players decide how much money to contribute to a public pool. The total amount of money contributed is multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and then divided equally among the players. If Player 1 contributes $20, Player 2 contributes $30, and Player 3 contributes $40, what is the total amount of money in the public pool, and how much money will each player receive?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the total amount of money contributed to the public pool by adding the contributions of all three players:\n\nTotal contribution = Player 1's contribution + Player 2's contribution + Player 3's contribution\nTotal contribution = $20 + $30 + $40\nTotal contribution = $90\n\nNext, we need to multiply the total contribution by the factor of 1.5:\n\nPublic pool amount = Total contribution * 1.5\nPublic pool amount = $90 * 1.5\nPublic pool amount = $135\n\nNow, we need to divide the public pool amount equally among the three players:\n\nAmount received by each player = Public pool amount / 3\nAmount received by each player = $135 / 3\nAmount received by each player = $45\n\nSo, the total amount of money in the public pool is $135, and each player will receive $45."
