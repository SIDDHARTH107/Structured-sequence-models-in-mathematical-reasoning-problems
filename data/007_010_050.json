    "message_2": "To find the smallest possible value of n, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The given conditions can be written as:\n\nn ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nn ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 7, which is 35. Now, we can check the numbers that are congruent to 2 modulo 5 and congruent to 3 modulo 7 within the range of the LCM.\n\nChecking the numbers:\n\n2 (mod 5): 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32\n3 (mod 7): 3, 10, 17, 24, 31\n\nThe smallest number that appears in both lists is 17. Therefore, the smallest possible value of n is 17."
