    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to perform a certain task. The agent can either perform the task diligently, which has a 90% chance of succeeding and earns the principal a profit of $100,000 or perform the task lazily, which has a 60% chance of succeeding and earns the principal a profit of $50,000. However, the agent gets a utility of $80,000 for the task done diligently and $70,000 for it done lazily.\n\nAssuming the agent's choice hinges on the payoff they will receive, what is the agent's optimal strategy, and how much can the principal expect to profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine the agent's optimal strategy, we need to compare the expected utility of performing the task diligently versus performing it lazily. \n\nExpected utility of performing the task diligently:\n0.9 * $80,000 = $72,000\n\nExpected utility of performing the task lazily:\n0.6 * $70,000 = $42,000\n\nSince the expected utility of performing the task diligently is higher ($72,000) than the expected utility of performing it lazily ($42,000), the agent's optimal strategy is to perform the task diligently.\n\nNow, let's calculate the principal's expected profit when the agent performs the task diligently:\n\nExpected profit for the principal when the agent performs the task diligently:\n0.9 * $100,000 = $90,000\n\nTherefore, the principal can expect to profit $90,000 when the agent chooses the optimal strategy of performing the task diligently."
