    "message_2": "Let S be a set containing 3 elements, i.e., S = {a, b, c}. The power set of S, denoted as P(S), is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.\n\nP(S) = {âˆ…, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}\n\nThe size of the power set of S is the number of elements in P(S). In this case, there are 8 elements in P(S).\n\nNow, let's compare the size of S and P(S). The size of S is 3, as it contains 3 elements, while the size of P(S) is 8. Since 8 > 3, the power set of S is larger than S itself."
