    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square using the digits 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe first row can be filled in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, let's consider the second row. Since the second row cannot have any digit repeated from the first row in the same column, there are only 2 options for the first column, 1 option for the second column, and 1 option for the third column. So, there are 2 x 1 x 1 = 2 ways to fill the second row.\n\nFor the third row, there is only 1 way to fill it, as all the remaining digits are fixed due to the constraints of the Latin square.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible 3x3 Latin squares using the digits 1, 2, and 3 without repeating any digit in each row or column is 6 x 2 x 1 = 12."
