    "message_2": "Using the logarithmic properties, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\nlog(25) + log(5) - log(2) = log(25 * 5) - log(2) = log(125) - log(2)\n\nNow, we can use the quotient rule for logarithms:\n\nlog(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)\n\nSo, log(125) - log(2) = log(125/2) = log(62.5)\n\nThe simplified logarithmic expression is log(62.5)."
