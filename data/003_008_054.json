    "message_1": "Okay, here's an example of a problem:\n\nThe height of a right-angled triangle is 10 cm, and its base is 8 cm. Find its area using trigonometry. Round your answer to one decimal place.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a right-angled triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 10\nArea = 4 * 10\nArea = 40\n\nSo, the area of the right-angled triangle is 40 square centimeters."
