    "message_2": "Let L be a linear series of degree 11 on X. We want to find the dimension of L, which is denoted by l(L). To do this, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem, which states that for any divisor D on X, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K_X - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere g is the genus of X (in this case, g = 3), K_X is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of D.\n\nIn our case, D is the divisor associated with the linear series L, so deg(D) = 11. We want to find l(D) = l(L). To do this, we need to compute l(K_X - D).\n\nSince there exists a linear series of degree 4 and dimension 2 on X, we know that the canonical divisor K_X has degree 2g - 2 = 4 (by the degree-genus formula). Therefore, K_X - D has degree 4 - 11 = -7.\n\nNow, since the degree of K_X - D is negative, we have l(K_X - D) = 0 (by the property of linear series). Thus, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(L) - 0 = 11 + 1 - 3,\nl(L) = 9.\n\nSo, the dimension of the linear series of degree 11 on X is 9."
