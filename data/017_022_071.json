The alternating group A_5\n5. The symmetric group S_3 acting on the cosets of A_5 in S_5, which is also known as the holomorph of A_5 or Hol(A_5)\n\nThese groups are all distinct and non-isomorphic, meaning that they have different structures and cannot be mapped onto each other in a way that preserves their group operations."
