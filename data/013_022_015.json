    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given $100 and can choose to share any amount with Player 2, keeping the rest. If Player 2 accepts the offer, both players keep their respective amounts. If Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. \n\nIf Player 1 offers $20, what is the minimum amount that Player 2 would have to receive in order to accept the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, Player 2 has no power to reject or accept the offer, as the decision is solely made by Player 1. Therefore, the minimum amount that Player 2 would have to receive in order to \"accept\" the offer is $0, as they have no choice in the matter. However, if you meant to describe the Ultimatum Game, where Player 2 has the power to accept or reject the offer, the minimum amount that Player 2 would have to receive in order to accept the offer would depend on their individual preferences and their willingness to accept a certain amount."
