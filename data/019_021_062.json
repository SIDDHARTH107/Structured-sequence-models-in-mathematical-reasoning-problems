    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the possible strategies for both players and determine the best response for each player given the other player's strategy. Let's create a payoff matrix to represent the possible outcomes of the game:\n\n```\n          Player 2\n          H    T\n        +----+----+\n    H   | 1,0 | 0,1 |\nPlayer 1 +----+----+\n    T   | 0,1 | 1,0 |\n        +----+----+\n```\n\nIn this matrix, the first number in each cell represents the payoff for Player 1, and the second number represents the payoff for Player 2. For example, if both players choose H, Player 1 wins and gets a payoff of 1, while Player 2 loses and gets a payoff of 0.\n\nNow let's analyze the best responses for each player:\n\n1. If Player 2 chooses H, Player 1's best response is to choose H as well, since this results in a payoff of 1 for Player 1 (compared to a payoff of 0 if Player 1 chooses T).\n2. If Player 2 chooses T, Player 1's best response is to choose T, since this results in a payoff of 1 for Player 1 (compared to a payoff of 0 if Player 1 chooses H).\n\nSimilarly, for Player 2:\n\n1. If Player 1 chooses H, Player 2's best response is to choose T, since this results in a payoff of 1 for Player 2 (compared to a payoff of 0 if Player 2 chooses H).\n2. If Player 1 chooses T, Player 2's best response is to choose H, since this results in a payoff of 1 for Player 2 (compared to a payoff of 0 if Player 2 chooses T).\n\nIn this game, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium, as neither player has a dominant strategy. However, there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player chooses H or T with equal probability (1/2). In this case, each player's expected payoff is 1/2, and neither player can improve their expected payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy."
