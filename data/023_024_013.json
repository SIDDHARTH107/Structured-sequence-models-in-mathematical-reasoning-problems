    "message_1": "A function f(x) has a periodic discontinuity defined as:\n\nf(x) = \n-1, 0 ≤ x < 1\n1, 1 ≤ x < 2\n\nFind the Fourier series of the function f(x) over the interval [0,2]. Find the first three non-zero Fourier coefficients and sketch the graph of the function's partial sums up to the third harmonic.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) over the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We will only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe formula for b_n is:\n\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)] dx, where L is half the period of the function. In this case, L = 1.\n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3, we have:\n\nb_1 = ∫[-sin(πx)] dx from 0 to 1 + ∫[sin(πx)] dx from 1 to 2\nb_2 = ∫[-sin(2πx)] dx from 0 to 1 + ∫[sin(2πx)] dx from 1 to 2\nb_3 = ∫[-sin(3πx)] dx from 0 to 1 + ∫[sin(3πx)] dx from 1 to 2\n\nCalculating the integrals, we get:\n\nb_1 = [-2/π] + [2/π] = 4/π\nb_2 = [-1/π] + [1/π] = 0\nb_3 = [-2/(3π)] + [2/(3π)] = 4/(3π)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) as:\n\nf(x) ≈ (4/π) * sin(πx) + (4/(3π)) * sin(3πx)\n\nTo sketch the graph of the function's partial sums up to the third harmonic, we can plot the sum of the first three non-zero Fourier coefficients:\n\nf(x) ≈ (4/π) * sin(πx) + (4/(3π)) * sin(3πx)\n\nThe graph will show a periodic wave-like pattern with a period of 2 units, oscillating between -1 and 1. The first harmonic (n=1) will have a single peak and trough within the period, while the third harmonic (n=3) will have three peaks and troughs within the same period. The sum of these harmonics will approximate the original function f(x) with a discontinuity at x=1."
