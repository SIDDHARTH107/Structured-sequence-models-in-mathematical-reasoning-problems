    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cylindrical can using integration, we will consider the can as a series of infinitesimally thin circular disks stacked on top of each other. The volume of each disk can be found using the formula for the area of a circle (πr^2) multiplied by its infinitesimal thickness (dy). Then, we will integrate the volume of these disks over the height of the cylinder.\n\nLet's set up the integral:\n\nThe radius of the cylinder is constant, r = 5 cm.\nThe height of the cylinder is h = 10 cm.\n\nThe volume of an infinitesimally thin disk with thickness dy at a height y is given by:\n\ndV = πr^2 dy\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the height of the cylinder (from y = 0 to y = 10):\n\nV = ∫(πr^2 dy) from 0 to 10\n\nSince the radius is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nV = πr^2 ∫(dy) from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\nV = πr^2 [y] from 0 to 10\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = πr^2 (10 - 0)\n\nV = π(5^2)(10)\n\nV = 250π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the cylindrical can is 250π cubic centimeters."
