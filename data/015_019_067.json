    "message_2": "To find the period of the oscillations of the Henon-Heiles system, we need to solve the Hamilton's equations of motion for the given Hamiltonian and initial conditions. The Hamilton's equations are given by:\n\ndx/dt = ∂H/∂p_x\ndy/dt = ∂H/∂p_y\ndp_x/dt = -∂H/∂x\ndp_y/dt = -∂H/∂y\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian:\n\n∂H/∂p_x = p_x\n∂H/∂p_y = p_y\n∂H/∂x = x - lambda*(y^2 - 2*x^2 - 2/3*x^3)\n∂H/∂y = y + lambda*(2*y*x - 2/3*y^3)\n\nNow, we can write the Hamilton's equations:\n\ndx/dt = p_x\ndy/dt = p_y\ndp_x/dt = -x + lambda*(y^2 - 2*x^2 - 2/3*x^3)\ndp_y/dt = -y - lambda*(2*y*x - 2/3*y^3)\n\nGiven the initial conditions x(0) = 0, y(0) = 1, p_x(0) = 0, and p_y(0) = 0, we need to solve this system of differential equations numerically to find the period of the oscillations. This can be done using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method or by using software like Mathematica or Python's SciPy library.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Henon-Heiles system is a non-integrable system, meaning that it does not have a general analytical solution. Therefore, the period of the oscillations may not be constant and may depend on the specific trajectory of the system. In such cases, it is common to analyze the system using Poincaré sections or other techniques from the field of dynamical systems and chaos theory."
