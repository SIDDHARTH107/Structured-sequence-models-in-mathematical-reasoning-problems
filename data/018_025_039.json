    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference between sets A and B, we need to find the elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA symmetric difference B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nA symmetric difference B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find B symmetric difference A:\n\nB symmetric difference A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nB ∩ A = {3, 4}\n\nB symmetric difference A = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nAs we can see, A symmetric difference B = B symmetric difference A = {1, 2, 5, 6}. This shows that the symmetric difference operation is commutative.\n\nHowever, the question asks to show that A symmetric difference B is not commutative with respect to intersection. This means we need to show that (A symmetric difference B) ∩ A ≠ A ∩ (A symmetric difference B).\n\nLet's find (A symmetric difference B) ∩ A:\n\n(A symmetric difference B) ∩ A = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1, 2}\n\nNow let's find A ∩ (A symmetric difference B):\n\nA ∩ (A symmetric difference B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 5, 6} = {1, 2}\n\nAs we can see, (A symmetric difference B) ∩ A = A ∩ (A symmetric difference B) = {1, 2}. This shows that the symmetric difference operation is actually commutative with respect to intersection, contrary to the question's claim."
