    "message_2": "Let $A = (x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $B = (x_2, y_2, z_2)$ be the homogeneous coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ on the curve $C$. Since $A$ and $B$ are on $C$, we have:\n\n$f(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1^4 + y_1^4 + z_1^4 = 0$\n$f(x_2, y_2, z_2) = x_2^4 + y_2^4 + z_2^4 = 0$\n\nNow, consider a degree-2 divisor (conic) passing through both $A$ and $B$. The equation of such a conic can be written as:\n\n$g(x, y, z) = a_1x^2 + a_2y^2 + a_3z^2 + a_4xy + a_5xz + a_6yz$\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are on this conic, we have:\n\n$g(x_1, y_1, z_1) = a_1x_1^2 + a_2y_1^2 + a_3z_1^2 + a_4x_1y_1 + a_5x_1z_1 + a_6y_1z_1 = 0$\n$g(x_2, y_2, z_2) = a_1x_2^2 + a_2y_2^2 + a_3z_2^2 + a_4x_2y_2 + a_5x_2z_2 + a_6y_2z_2 = 0$\n\nThese are two linear equations in the six unknowns $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$. Since we are looking for a conic that is also a divisor on $C$, we need to find the intersection of the conic $g(x, y, z) = 0$ with the curve $f(x, y, z) = 0$. This intersection can be computed using the resultant of the two polynomials $f$ and $g$ with respect to one of the variables, say $z$.\n\nThe resultant will be a polynomial in $x$ and $y$ with coefficients depending on the unknowns $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$. Since $C$ is a smooth curve of degree 4, the intersection of $C$ with a conic should consist of 8 points (by BÃ©zout's theorem). However, we already know that two of these points are $A$ and $B$. Therefore, the resultant must be a polynomial of degree 6 in $x$ and $y$.\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations involving the coefficients of the resultant and the unknowns $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$. Solving this system, we can find the number of linearly independent solutions, which corresponds to the number of distinct degree-2 divisors on $C$ that pass through both $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe system has 6 unknowns and 6 equations (2 from the conditions that $A$ and $B$ are on the conic, and 4 from the conditions on the coefficients of the resultant). Since the curve $C$ is smooth, the system has a unique solution, which corresponds to a single degree-2 divisor on $C$ that passes through both $A$ and $B$.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 degree-2 divisor on $C$ that passes through both $A$ and $B$."
