    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 4 - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 4 - x^2\n\nAdding x^2 to both sides, we get:\n\n2x^2 = 4\n\nDividing by 2, we have:\n\nx^2 = 2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nx = ±√2\n\nSo the points of intersection are at x = -√2 and x = √2.\n\nNow, we'll integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [-√2, √2] to find the area enclosed between the curves:\n\nArea = ∫[-√2, √2] (4 - x^2 - x^2) dx\n\nArea = ∫[-√2, √2] (4 - 2x^2) dx\n\nNow we'll find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\n∫(4 - 2x^2) dx = 4x - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow we'll evaluate the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval and subtract:\n\nArea = [4(√2) - (2/3)(√2)^3] - [4(-√2) - (2/3)(-√2)^3]\n\nArea = [4√2 - (2/3)(4√2)] - [-4√2 - (2/3)(-4√2)]\n\nArea = [4√2 - (8/3)√2] - [-4√2 + (8/3)√2]\n\nArea = [4√2 - (8/3)√2 + 4√2 - (8/3)√2]\n\nArea = 8√2 - (16/3)√2\n\nArea = (8/3)√2\n\nSo the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 4 - x^2 is (8/3)√2 square units."
