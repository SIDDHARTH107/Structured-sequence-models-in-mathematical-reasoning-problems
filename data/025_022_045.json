    "message_2": "To determine the number of exceptional curves on a smooth projective cubic surface X, we can use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: A smooth cubic surface X in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ contains exactly 27 lines, which are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\nProof: The proof of this theorem is based on the intersection theory and the adjunction formula. We will sketch the main ideas of the proof.\n\n1. Consider the homogeneous coordinates $[x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3]$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. A line L in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ can be parametrized by two linear forms $l_1, l_2$ such that $l_1(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3) = 0$ and $l_2(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3) = 0$. \n\n2. The intersection of L with the cubic surface X is given by the vanishing of the cubic polynomial $f(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3) = 0$. Since L is a line, the intersection is of degree 3, and we have $f = \\alpha l_1^3 + \\beta l_1^2l_2 + \\gamma l_1l_2^2 + \\delta l_2^3$ for some complex numbers $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$.\n\n3. The condition for L to be contained in X is that the coefficients $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$ satisfy a certain relation. This relation defines a surface S in the parameter space of lines in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The surface S is a K3 surface, and its Picard group is generated by the hyperplane class H and the class of a line L.\n\n4. The adjunction formula gives the self-intersection number of a line L on X as $L^2 = 2LH - H^2 = -1$. This means that every line on X is an exceptional curve.\n\n5. The number of lines on X can be computed by the intersection number $H^3 = 27$. This means that there are exactly 27 lines on X.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 27 exceptional curves on a smooth projective cubic surface X, which are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$."
