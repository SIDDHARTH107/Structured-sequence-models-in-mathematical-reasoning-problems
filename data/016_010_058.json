    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the gaps between three mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. The curvatures of the circles follow a specific pattern based on Descartes' Circle Theorem.\n\nDescartes' Circle Theorem states that if four circles are mutually tangent, their curvatures (k) satisfy the equation:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nGiven the initial circles with curvatures (1, 1, 0), we can find the curvature of the first circle in the second generation:\n\n(1 + 1 + 0 + k4)^2 = 2(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + k4^2)\n(2 + k4)^2 = 2(1 + 1 + k4^2)\n4 + 4k4 + k4^2 = 4 + 2k4^2\nk4^2 - 4k4 = 0\nk4(k4 - 4) = 0\n\nk4 = 0 (which corresponds to the initial circle with curvature 0) or k4 = 4.\n\nSo, the second generation has circles with curvatures (1, 1, 0, 4).\n\nNow, we'll find the curvatures of the circles in the third generation. We'll use the same equation and the curvatures from the second generation:\n\nCase 1: (1, 1, 4, k5)\n(1 + 1 + 4 + k5)^2 = 2(1^2 + 1^2 + 4^2 + k5^2)\n(6 + k5)^2 = 2(1 + 1 + 16 + k5^2)\n(6 + k5)^2 = 2(18 + k5^2)\n36 + 12k5 + k5^2 = 36 + 2k5^2\nk5^2 - 12k5 = 0\nk5(k5 - 12) = 0\n\nk5 = 0 (which corresponds to the initial circle with curvature 0) or k5 = 12.\n\nCase 2: (1, 4, 0, k6)\n(1 + 4 + 0 + k6)^2 = 2(1^2 + 4^2 + 0^2 + k6^2)\n(5 + k6)^2 = 2(1 + 16 + k6^2)\n(5 + k6)^2 = 2(17 + k6^2)\n25 + 10k6 + k6^2 = 34 + 2k6^2\nk6^2 - 10k6 + 9 = 0\n(k6 - 9)(k6 - 1) = 0\n\nk6 = 1 (which corresponds to the initial circle with curvature 1) or k6 = 9.\n\nSo, the third generation has circles with curvatures (1, 1, 0, 4, 12, 9).\n\nThe sum of the curvatures of the circles in the third generation is:\n\n1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 12 + 9 = 27."
