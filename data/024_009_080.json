    "message_2": "To find the scalar curvature of M, we first need to find the metric tensor and the Riemann curvature tensor for the 3-dimensional sphere. The metric tensor for a 3-dimensional sphere in Euclidean 4-space can be expressed in spherical coordinates as:\n\ng_ij = diag(r^2, r^2 * sin^2(θ), r^2 * sin^2(θ) * sin^2(φ))\n\nwhere r = 5, and θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor can be calculated using the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives. For a 3-dimensional sphere, the non-zero components of the Riemann curvature tensor are:\n\nR_θθ = -r^2\nR_φφ = -r^2 * sin^2(θ)\nR_ψψ = -r^2 * sin^2(θ) * sin^2(φ)\n\nThe scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci tensor, which is obtained by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor. The Ricci tensor components are:\n\nRicci_θθ = R^θ_θ = -2r^2\nRicci_φφ = R^φ_φ = -2r^2 * sin^2(θ)\nRicci_ψψ = R^ψ_ψ = -2r^2 * sin^2(θ) * sin^2(φ)\n\nThe scalar curvature is the sum of the diagonal components of the Ricci tensor:\n\nScalar curvature = R = g^θθ * Ricci_θθ + g^φφ * Ricci_φφ + g^ψψ * Ricci_ψψ\n\nSince g^θθ = 1/r^2, g^φφ = 1/(r^2 * sin^2(θ)), and g^ψψ = 1/(r^2 * sin^2(θ) * sin^2(φ)), we have:\n\nR = (-2r^2) * (1/r^2) + (-2r^2 * sin^2(θ)) * (1/(r^2 * sin^2(θ))) + (-2r^2 * sin^2(θ) * sin^2(φ)) * (1/(r^2 * sin^2(θ) * sin^2(φ)))\n\nR = -2 - 2 - 2\n\nR = -6\n\nSo, the scalar curvature of the 3-dimensional sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin in Euclidean 4-space is -6."
