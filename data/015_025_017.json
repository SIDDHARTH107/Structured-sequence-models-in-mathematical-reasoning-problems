    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the van der Pol oscillator at a certain time t, we need to solve the van der Pol equation with the given parameters and initial conditions. The van der Pol equation is a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation given by:\n\nx''(t) - μ(1 - x(t)^2)x'(t) + ω₀^2 x(t) = 0\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, x'(t) and x''(t) are the first and second derivatives of x(t) with respect to time t, μ is the damping coefficient, and ω₀ is the natural frequency.\n\nIn this problem, we have a forcing frequency 1.3 times the natural frequency, so we need to modify the equation to include the forcing term:\n\nx''(t) - μ(1 - x(t)^2)x'(t) + ω₀^2 x(t) = F₀ * cos(1.3 * ω₀ * t)\n\nwhere F₀ is the amplitude of the forcing term.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Forcing frequency = 1.3 * ω₀\n- Damping coefficient (μ) = 0.5\n- Initial conditions: x(0) = 1, x'(0) = 0\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillator at a certain time t, we need to solve this nonlinear ordinary differential equation with the given initial conditions. This equation does not have a closed-form solution, so we need to use numerical methods to solve it, such as the Runge-Kutta method or other numerical integration techniques.\n\nOnce we have the solution x(t), we can find the amplitude at a certain time t by simply evaluating x(t) at that specific time."
