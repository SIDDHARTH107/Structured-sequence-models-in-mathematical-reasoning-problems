    "message_2": "To find the angle between the ladder and the ground, we can use the inverse tangent function (arctan or tan^(-1)). We are given the length of the ladder (20 feet) and the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall (8 feet). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the ladder on the wall.\n\nLet's denote the height of the ladder on the wall as 'a', the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall as 'b' (8 feet), and the length of the ladder as 'c' (20 feet). According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe know b = 8 and c = 20, so:\n\na^2 + 8^2 = 20^2\na^2 + 64 = 400\na^2 = 336\na = sqrt(336)\na ≈ 18.33 feet\n\nNow that we have the height of the ladder on the wall, we can find the angle between the ladder and the ground using the inverse tangent function:\n\nangle = arctan(opposite/adjacent) = arctan(a/b)\nangle = arctan(18.33/8)\nangle ≈ 66.42 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the ladder and the ground is approximately 66 degrees."
