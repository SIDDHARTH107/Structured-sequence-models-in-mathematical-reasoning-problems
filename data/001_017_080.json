    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+3) - log(x-2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b) to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation:\n\nlog((x+3)/(x-2)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log(a) = b, then a = 10^b:\n\n(x+3)/(x-2) = 10^2\n\n(x+3)/(x-2) = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\nx + 3 = 100(x - 2)\n\nx + 3 = 100x - 200\n\nNow, we can isolate x by moving all the terms involving x to one side of the equation:\n\nx - 100x = -200 - 3\n\n-99x = -203\n\nNow, we can divide by -99 to solve for x:\n\nx = -203 / -99\n\nx ≈ 2.05\n\nSo, the solution to the equation log(x+3) - log(x-2) = 2 is x ≈ 2.05."
