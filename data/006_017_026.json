    "message_2": "To find the probability of a car getting into an accident with a deer on this road, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of cars getting into accidents with deer, which is 35. The total number of outcomes is the total number of cars, which is 1000.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\nProbability = 35 / 1000\n\nNow, we can simplify this fraction:\n\nProbability = 0.035\n\nTo round the answer to three decimal places, we have:\n\nProbability = 0.035\n\nSo, the probability of a car getting into an accident with a deer on this road is 0.035 or 3.5%."
