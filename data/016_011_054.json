    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, where each iteration is formed by replacing each square in the previous iteration with a smaller pattern of squares. In the case of the Vicsek fractal, the pattern consists of 5 smaller squares, with one in the center and the other four in the corners.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the nth iteration as P(n). For the first iteration, P(1) = 4 units.\n\nIn each iteration, the side length of the smaller squares is 1/3 of the side length of the squares in the previous iteration. Therefore, the perimeter of each smaller square is also 1/3 of the perimeter of the squares in the previous iteration.\n\nSince there are 5 smaller squares in the pattern, the perimeter of the nth iteration can be calculated as:\n\nP(n) = 5 * (1/3) * P(n-1)\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the 5th iteration using this formula:\n\nP(2) = 5 * (1/3) * P(1) = 5 * (1/3) * 4 = 20/3\nP(3) = 5 * (1/3) * P(2) = 5 * (1/3) * (20/3) = 100/9\nP(4) = 5 * (1/3) * P(3) = 5 * (1/3) * (100/9) = 500/27\nP(5) = 5 * (1/3) * P(4) = 5 * (1/3) * (500/27) = 2500/81\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 5th iteration of the Vicsek fractal is 2500/81 units."
