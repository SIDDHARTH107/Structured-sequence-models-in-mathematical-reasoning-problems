    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is formed by successively adding smaller squares to the existing pattern. In each iteration, a square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square and the four corner squares are kept. This means that in each iteration, the number of squares increases by a factor of 5.\n\nTo find the total number of squares in the 4th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of squares = Initial number of squares * (Multiplier)^(Iteration - 1)\n\nIn this case, the initial number of squares is 1, the multiplier is 5, and the iteration is 4.\n\nTotal number of squares = 1 * 5^(4 - 1)\nTotal number of squares = 1 * 5^3\nTotal number of squares = 1 * 125\nTotal number of squares = 125\n\nSo, there are 125 squares in the 4th iteration of the Vicsek fractal."
