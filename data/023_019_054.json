    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using the Fourier Transform, we first need to analyze the poles of the transfer function H(s). The poles are the roots of the denominator of the transfer function. A system is stable if all the poles have negative real parts.\n\nLet's find the poles of the transfer function:\n\nDenominator: $$s^3 + 5s^2 + 4s + 2$$\n\nTo find the roots of this cubic polynomial, we can use various methods such as factoring, synthetic division, or numerical methods. In this case, we will use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (2) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (1).\n\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2\nFactors of 1: ±1\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±2\n\nNow, we test these possible roots:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 5 + 4 + 2 ≠ 0\nf(-1) = -1 + 5 - 4 + 2 ≠ 0\nf(2) = 8 + 20 + 8 + 2 ≠ 0\nf(-2) = -8 + 20 - 8 + 2 ≠ 0\n\nSince none of these possible rational roots are actual roots, we can conclude that the polynomial has no rational roots. At this point, we would need to resort to numerical methods or other techniques to find the roots of the polynomial.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of determining stability, we can use the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, which allows us to determine the number of roots with positive real parts without explicitly finding the roots.\n\nConstruct the Routh array:\n\n```\ns^3 |  1   4\ns^2 |  5   2\ns^1 |  3.6\ns^0 |  2\n```\n\nThere are no sign changes in the first column, which means that there are no roots with positive real parts. Since we already tested for rational roots with negative real parts and found none, we can conclude that all the roots have negative real parts, and the system is stable."
