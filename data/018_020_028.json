    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and the union of A and B. Then prove that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the union of A and B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In this case:\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3}) = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and B. The union of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets. In this case:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the union of A and B. In other words, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = A ∪ B\n\nWe already found that A ∆ B = {1, 4} and A ∩ B = {2, 3}. So, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = {1, 4} ∪ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nAs we can see, (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4}, which is equal to A ∪ B. Therefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the union of A and B."
