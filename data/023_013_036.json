    "message_1": "A metal rod is 1 meter in length and has a temperature distribution of T(x) = sin(2πx/L) at t=0. The ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature of 0°C. What is the temperature distribution of the rod at t=10 seconds? Use the Fourier transform to solve the heat transfer problem. The thermal diffusivity of the rod is 0.25 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat transfer problem, we need to find the temperature distribution T(x, t) at any time t. We can use the heat equation and Fourier series to solve this problem. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity (0.25 m²/s).\n\nSince the ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature of 0°C, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = T(L, t) = 0\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nT(x, 0) = sin(2πx/L)\n\nWe can use the Fourier series to represent the temperature distribution T(x, t) as:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L) * exp(-α(nπ/L)²t)]\n\nwhere B_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find the B_n coefficients, we can use the initial temperature distribution:\n\nsin(2πx/L) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nWe can find B_n by multiplying both sides by sin(mπx/L) and integrating from 0 to L:\n\n∫₀ᴸ [sin(2πx/L) * sin(mπx/L) dx] = ∫₀ᴸ [B_m * sin(mπx/L) * sin(mπx/L) dx]\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of sine functions, we get:\n\nB_m = (2/L) * ∫₀ᴸ [sin(2πx/L) * sin(mπx/L) dx]\n\nFor m = 1, we have:\n\nB_1 = (2/L) * ∫₀ᴸ [sin(2πx/L) * sin(πx/L) dx]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we find:\n\nB_1 = 2\n\nFor m > 1, we have:\n\nB_m = (2/L) * ∫₀ᴸ [sin(2πx/L) * sin(mπx/L) dx]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we find:\n\nB_m = 0\n\nSo, the temperature distribution T(x, t) is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = 2 * sin(πx/L) * exp(-α(π/L)²t)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 10 seconds:\n\nT(x, 10) = 2 * sin(πx/L) * exp(-0.25(π/L)² * 10)\n\nSince L = 1 meter, we have:\n\nT(x, 10) = 2 * sin(πx) * exp(-0.25π² * 10)\n\nSo, the temperature distribution of the rod at t = 10 seconds is:\n\nT(x, 10) = 2 * sin(πx) * exp(-2.5π²)"
