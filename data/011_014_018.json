    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is at least one vertex that cannot be reached from the other vertices. In other words, we need to break the connectivity of the graph.\n\nThe minimum number of edges required to disconnect a graph can be found using the formula:\n\nMinimum edges to remove = (number of vertices) - 1\n\nIn this case, the graph has six vertices, so the minimum number of edges required to disconnect the graph is:\n\nMinimum edges to remove = 6 - 1 = 5\n\nTherefore, at least 5 edges need to be removed from the graph to make it disconnected."
