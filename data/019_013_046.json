    "message_2": "To prove the statement using second-order logic, we first need to define some predicates and functions:\n\n1. Bijection: A function f is a bijection between sets A and B if it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).\n2. Injective: A function f is injective if for every x, y in A, f(x) = f(y) implies x = y.\n3. Surjective: A function f is surjective if for every y in B, there exists an x in A such that f(x) = y.\n4. Cardinality: Two sets A and B have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between them.\n\nNow, we can express the statement using second-order logic:\n\n∀A, B (∃!f (Bijection(f, A, B)) → Cardinality(A) = Cardinality(B))\n\nTo prove this, we need to show that if there exists a unique bijection between A and B, then A and B have the same cardinality. We can do this by showing that the existence of a bijection implies both injectivity and surjectivity, which in turn implies that the sets have the same cardinality.\n\nProof:\n\nAssume that there exists a unique bijection f between sets A and B. By the definition of bijection, f is both injective and surjective.\n\nInjective: ∀x, y ∈ A (f(x) = f(y) → x = y)\nSurjective: ∀y ∈ B (∃x ∈ A (f(x) = y))\n\nNow, we can use the injective and surjective properties to show that the cardinality of A is equal to the cardinality of B.\n\nSince f is injective, every element in A is mapped to a unique element in B. This means that there are no \"extra\" elements in A that are not mapped to elements in B. Similarly, since f is surjective, every element in B is mapped to by some element in A. This means that there are no \"extra\" elements in B that are not mapped to by elements in A.\n\nThus, the cardinality of A is equal to the cardinality of B, as every element in A is uniquely mapped to an element in B, and every element in B is uniquely mapped to by an element in A.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if there exists a unique bijection between A and B, then A and B have the same cardinality:\n\n∀A, B (∃!f (Bijection(f, A, B)) → Cardinality(A) = Cardinality(B))"
