    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the curve C at the point (1, 2), we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 6x - 5. Then, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 6\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, 2):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 2) = -3(1)^2 - 6 = -9\n∂F/∂y(1, 2) = 2(2) = 4\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J of the curve C at the point (1, 2) is a 1x2 matrix given by:\n\nJ = [∂F/∂x(1, 2), ∂F/∂y(1, 2)] = [-9, 4]"
