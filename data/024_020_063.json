    "message_2": "The Hopf map is a mapping from the 3-sphere (S^3) to the 2-sphere (S^2). Let's denote the Hopf map as h: S^3 → S^2. The 3-sphere S^3 can be described as the set of points (x, y, z, w) in ℝ^4 such that x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = r^2. The north pole of S^3 is the point N = (0, 0, 0, r).\n\nTo determine the Hopf map using the stereographic projection, we first project points from S^3 onto the complex plane, which can be identified with ℝ^2. Let P = (x, y, z, w) be a point on S^3, and let Q = (u, v) be the corresponding point on the complex plane. The stereographic projection is given by:\n\nu = x / (r - w)\nv = y / (r - w)\n\nNow, we can express the complex numbers corresponding to the points Q and P as:\n\nQ = u + iv\nP = x + iy + jz + kw\n\nThe Hopf map is defined by associating each point P on S^3 with a point on S^2, which can be represented as a complex number. To do this, we use the quaternion multiplication:\n\nP' = PQP*\n\nwhere P' is the image of P under the Hopf map, and P* is the conjugate of P:\n\nP* = x - iy - jz - kw\n\nPerforming the quaternion multiplication, we get:\n\nP' = (x^2 - y^2 - z^2 - w^2) + 2i(xy + wz) + 2j(xz - wy) + 2k(yz + wx)\n\nSince P is on S^3, we have x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = r^2, so the real part of P' is 0. Thus, we can write P' as:\n\nP' = 2i(xy + wz) + 2j(xz - wy) + 2k(yz + wx)\n\nNow, we can find the stereographic projection of P' onto the complex plane. Let Q' = (u', v') be the corresponding point on the complex plane. We have:\n\nu' = 2(xy + wz) / (r - (yz + wx))\nv' = 2(xz - wy) / (r - (yz + wx))\n\nThe Hopf map h is then given by:\n\nh(P) = Q' = (u', v')\n\nSo, the Hopf map using the stereographic projection from the north pole of the sphere onto the complex plane is given by:\n\nh(x, y, z, w) = (2(xy + wz) / (r - (yz + wx)), 2(xz - wy) / (r - (yz + wx)))"
