    "message_1": "A student plays a game where they have to roll a fair six-sided die. If they roll a 4 or higher, they win $10. If they roll a 3 or lower, they lose $5. What is the probability that the student will win money in one game?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the student will win money in one game, we need to determine the probability of rolling a 4 or higher on a six-sided die.\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The outcomes that result in winning money are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 winning outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.\n\nThe probability of winning money in one game is the ratio of winning outcomes to total possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of winning outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability that the student will win money in one game is 1/2 or 50%."
