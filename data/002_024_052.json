    "message_1": "A trapezium has a parallel side of length 12cm, a non-parallel side of length 8cm, and a height of 5cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other parallel side and the length of the other non-parallel side.\n\nLet's denote the length of the other parallel side as 'a' and the length of the other non-parallel side as 'b'. We are given the height (5 cm) and one of the parallel sides (12 cm).\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other non-parallel side 'b'. Let's consider the right triangle formed by the height, the non-parallel side (8 cm), and the difference in length between the two parallel sides (a - 12 cm).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nb^2 = 5^2 + (a - 12)^2\n\nNow, let's consider the trapezium as a whole. The sum of the non-parallel sides (8 cm and b) should be equal to the sum of the parallel sides (12 cm and a).\n\n8 + b = 12 + a\nb - a = 4\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\n1) b^2 = 5^2 + (a - 12)^2\n2) b - a = 4\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express 'b' in terms of 'a':\n\nb = a + 4\n\nNow, substitute this expression for 'b' into equation (1):\n\n(a + 4)^2 = 5^2 + (a - 12)^2\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n\na^2 + 8a + 16 = 25 + a^2 - 24a + 144\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n8a + 16 = 25 - 24a + 144\n\nAdd 24a to both sides:\n\n32a + 16 = 169\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\n32a = 153\n\nDivide by 32:\n\na ≈ 4.78125 cm\n\nNow, find the value of 'b' using the expression we found earlier:\n\nb = a + 4\nb ≈ 4.78125 + 4\nb ≈ 8.78125 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 8 cm + 4.78125 cm + 8.78125 cm ≈ 33.5625 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 33.5625 cm."
