If the payoff matrix of the game is as follows:\n\n|       | B1   | B2   |\n|-------|-----|-----|\n| A1 | 3,2 | 1,1 |\n| A2 | 4,3 | 2,1 |\n| A3 | 2,4 | 3,3 |\n\nDetermine which strategy Player A should choose if Player B chooses B1 with probability 0.3 and B2 with probability 0.7, and what is the expected payoff for Player A.",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for Player A, we need to calculate the expected payoff for each of Player A's strategies given the probabilities of Player B's strategies.\n\nExpected payoff for A1:\n(0.3 * 3) + (0.7 * 1) = 0.9 + 0.7 = 1.6\n\nExpected payoff for A2:\n(0.3 * 4) + (0.7 * 2) = 1.2 + 1.4 = 2.6\n\nExpected payoff for A3:\n(0.3 * 2) + (0.7 * 3) = 0.6 + 2.1 = 2.7\n\nSince the expected payoff for A3 is the highest (2.7), Player A should choose strategy A3. The expected payoff for Player A when choosing A3 is 2.7."
