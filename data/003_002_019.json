    "message_2": "To find the height at which the ladder is touching the wall, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function relates the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the hypotenuse (length of the ladder) in a right triangle.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees and the length of the ladder (hypotenuse) is 10 meters. We want to find the height (opposite side).\n\nsin(60) = height / 10\n\nTo find the sine of 60 degrees, we can use a calculator or recall that sin(60) = √3/2.\n\n(√3/2) = height / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 10 * (√3/2)\n\nheight = 5√3\n\nSo, the height at which the ladder is touching the wall is 5√3 meters."
