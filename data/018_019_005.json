    "message_2": "First, let's recall the definition of symmetric difference: The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. Mathematically, A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A).\n\n1. Find A △ B:\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} - {3, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 7}\n\n2. Find (A △ B) △ A:\n(A △ B) △ A = ({1, 2, 4, 7} ∪ A) - ({1, 2, 4, 7} ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} - {1, 3, 5, 7} = {2, 4}\n\n3. Find B △ A:\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} - {3, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 7}\n\n4. Find A △ (B △ A):\nA △ (B △ A) = (A ∪ {1, 2, 4, 7}) - (A ∩ {1, 2, 4, 7}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} - {1, 3, 5, 7} = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we can see that the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A) are both equal to {2, 4}. This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative, as (A △ B) △ A = A △ (B △ A)."
