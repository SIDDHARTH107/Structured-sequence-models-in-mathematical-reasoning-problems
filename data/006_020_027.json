    "message_1": "In a certain community, there are 40 people who are interested in participating in a charity event. The event will be a carnival, and there are three different booths that the participants can contribute to: one for games, one for food, and one for merchandise. Suppose that each participant can choose to contribute to one or more booths. The probability that a participant will contribute to the game booth is 1/2, the probability that a participant will contribute to the food booth is 3/10, and the probability that a participant will contribute to the merchandise booth is 1/5. What is the probability that a randomly selected participant will contribute to at least one of the booths?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected participant will contribute to at least one of the booths, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The probability that a participant will contribute to at least one booth is equal to the sum of the probabilities of contributing to each booth individually, minus the sum of the probabilities of contributing to any two booths simultaneously, plus the probability of contributing to all three booths.\n\nLet A be the event that a participant contributes to the game booth, B be the event that a participant contributes to the food booth, and C be the event that a participant contributes to the merchandise booth.\n\nP(A) = 1/2\nP(B) = 3/10\nP(C) = 1/5\n\nWe also need to find the probabilities of contributing to any two booths simultaneously. Since the problem does not specify any correlation between the booths, we can assume that the probabilities are independent. Therefore, we can multiply the individual probabilities to find the joint probabilities.\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = (1/2) * (3/10) = 3/20\nP(A ∩ C) = P(A) * P(C) = (1/2) * (1/5) = 1/10\nP(B ∩ C) = P(B) * P(C) = (3/10) * (1/5) = 3/50\n\nLastly, we need to find the probability of contributing to all three booths simultaneously.\n\nP(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A) * P(B) * P(C) = (1/2) * (3/10) * (1/5) = 3/100\n\nNow we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the probability of contributing to at least one booth.\n\nP(A ∪ B ∪ C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A ∩ B) - P(A ∩ C) - P(B ∩ C) + P(A ∩ B ∩ C)\nP(A ∪ B ∪ C) = (1/2) + (3/10) + (1/5) - (3/20) - (1/10) - (3/50) + (3/100)\nP(A ∪ B ∪ C) = (50 + 30 + 20 - 15 - 10 - 6 + 3) / 100\nP(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 72 / 100\nP(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 18 / 25\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected participant will contribute to at least one of the booths is 18/25."
