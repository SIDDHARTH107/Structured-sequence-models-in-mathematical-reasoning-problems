    "message_1": "Here's an example problem for a math student to solve related to Epidemiology models for disease spread:\n\nThere is a population of 100,000 people. In the first week, there were 100 reported cases of a disease. The rate of transmission, i.e., the number of new cases caused by one infected person, is 0.05. Write a differential equation to model this scenario and use it to predict the number of cases after two weeks.",
    "message_2": "To model this scenario, we can use the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model, which is a simple compartmental model in epidemiology. However, since we are only concerned with the number of infected cases, we can simplify the model and focus on the infected compartment.\n\nLet I(t) be the number of infected individuals at time t (in weeks). The rate of change of infected individuals with respect to time, dI/dt, is proportional to the number of infected individuals and the rate of transmission. In this case, the rate of transmission is 0.05, and the initial number of infected individuals is 100.\n\nThe differential equation can be written as:\n\ndI/dt = 0.05 * I(t)\n\nTo solve this first-order linear differential equation, we can use the separation of variables method:\n\n(1/I(t)) dI = 0.05 dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/I(t)) dI = ∫0.05 dt\nln(I(t)) = 0.05t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition I(0) = 100:\n\nln(100) = 0.05(0) + C\nC = ln(100)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for I(t):\n\nln(I(t)) = 0.05t + ln(100)\nI(t) = e^(0.05t + ln(100))\n\nTo predict the number of cases after two weeks, we can plug in t = 2:\n\nI(2) = e^(0.05(2) + ln(100))\nI(2) = e^(0.1 + ln(100))\nI(2) = e^(ln(100) + 0.1)\nI(2) = e^(ln(100)) * e^(0.1)\nI(2) = 100 * e^(0.1)\n\nApproximating e^(0.1) ≈ 1.105, we get:\n\nI(2) ≈ 100 * 1.105\nI(2) ≈ 110.5\n\nAfter two weeks, there will be approximately 111 infected cases in the population."
