    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a numerical problem for the subtopic Non-monotonic logic in mathematics as it is a branch of mathematical logic concerned with reasoning that is not monotonic. Non-monotonic reasoning does not follow the usual rule of logic where the addition of a new premise to a set of premises cannot invalidate a conclusion that was already drawn from that set of premises. It deals with more complex forms of logical inference and involves reasoning with incomplete or uncertain information. Therefore, it is difficult to frame a precise numerical problem for this subtopic.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are looking for a numerical problem related to non-monotonic logic. However, as previously mentioned, non-monotonic logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with complex forms of logical inference and reasoning with incomplete or uncertain information. It is not directly related to numerical problems or calculations.\n\nIf you have any other mathematical topics or problems you'd like assistance with, please feel free to ask, and I'd be happy to help."
