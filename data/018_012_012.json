    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of AxB and BxC.\n\nAxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\nBxC = {(3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of BxC and AxC.\n\nAxC = {(1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6)}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian products:\n\n(AxB) x (BxC) = {((1,3),(3,5)), ((1,3),(3,6)), ((1,3),(4,5)), ((1,3),(4,6)), ((1,4),(3,5)), ((1,4),(3,6)), ((1,4),(4,5)), ((1,4),(4,6)), ((2,3),(3,5)), ((2,3),(3,6)), ((2,3),(4,5)), ((2,3),(4,6)), ((2,4),(3,5)), ((2,4),(3,6)), ((2,4),(4,5)), ((2,4),(4,6))}\n\n(BxC) x (AxC) = {((3,5),(1,5)), ((3,5),(1,6)), ((3,5),(2,5)), ((3,5),(2,6)), ((3,6),(1,5)), ((3,6),(1,6)), ((3,6),(2,5)), ((3,6),(2,6)), ((4,5),(1,5)), ((4,5),(1,6)), ((4,5),(2,5)), ((4,5),(2,6)), ((4,6),(1,5)), ((4,6),(1,6)), ((4,6),(2,5)), ((4,6),(2,6))}\n\nAs we can see, (AxB) x (BxC) â‰  (BxC) x (AxC). This shows that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection. The reason for this is that the Cartesian product operation combines elements from different sets into ordered pairs, and the order in which the sets are combined matters. When we change the order of the sets being combined, we get different ordered pairs, which results in different Cartesian products."
