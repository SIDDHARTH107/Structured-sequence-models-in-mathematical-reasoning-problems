    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by the number of triangles (6 in this case).\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so the side length of each triangle in the hexagon is also 8 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nFor our triangle with side length 8 cm:\n\nArea = (8² * √3) / 4\nArea = (64 * √3) / 4\nArea = 16√3 cm²\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one triangle by the number of triangles in the hexagon (6):\n\nTotal area of hexagon = 6 * (16√3 cm²)\nTotal area of hexagon = 96√3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon with a side length of 8 cm is 96√3 cm²."
