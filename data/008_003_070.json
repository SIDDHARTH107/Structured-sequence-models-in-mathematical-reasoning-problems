    "message_2": "To determine the rank of matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to transform it into its row-echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\n1. Matrix A is already in row-echelon form for the first row.\n\n2. Next, we need to eliminate the elements below the first pivot (1 in the first row). To do this, we can subtract 2 times the first row from the third row and subtract the first row from the fourth row:\n\n   A = [ 1  2  3  4\n         \n         0  1  2  1\n         \n         0  1 -2  0\n         \n         0  1  0  3 ]\n\n3. Now, we need to eliminate the elements below the second pivot (1 in the second row). To do this, we can subtract the second row from the third row and the fourth row:\n\n   A = [ 1  2  3  4\n         \n         0  1  2  1\n         \n         0  0 -4 -1\n         \n         0  0 -2  2 ]\n\n4. Finally, we need to make the third pivot equal to 1. To do this, we can divide the third row by -4:\n\n   A = [ 1  2  3  4\n         \n         0  1  2  1\n         \n         0  0  1  1/4\n         \n         0  0 -2  2 ]\n\nNow, matrix A is in row-echelon form. We can see that all rows are non-zero, so the rank of matrix A is 4."
