    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the projective variety X, we need to find the degree of the intersection of the two hypersurfaces. The degree of a hypersurface is the highest total degree of its defining polynomial.\n\nFor the first hypersurface, the defining polynomial is:\n\n𝑥₀²𝑥₁ + 𝑥₀𝑥₁² − 2𝑥₂𝑥₄\n\nThe highest total degree of this polynomial is 3 (e.g., 𝑥₀²𝑥₁ and 𝑥₀𝑥₁² both have a total degree of 3).\n\nFor the second hypersurface, the defining polynomial is:\n\n𝑥₀³ + 𝑥₁³ − 3𝑥₀𝑥₂²\n\nThe highest total degree of this polynomial is also 3 (e.g., 𝑥₀³ and 𝑥₁³ both have a total degree of 3).\n\nNow, to compute the degree of the intersection of these two hypersurfaces, we multiply their degrees:\n\ndegree(X) = degree(hypersurface 1) * degree(hypersurface 2) = 3 * 3 = 9\n\nSo, the degree of the projective variety X is 9."
