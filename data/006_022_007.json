    "message_1": "A school has 600 students, out of which 400 are girls and 200 are boys. The probability of a girl graduating from high school is 0.95, while the probability of a boy graduating from high school is 0.85. What is the probability that a randomly selected student from the school is a boy who will not graduate from high school?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student is a boy who will not graduate, we can use the formula:\n\nP(boy and not graduating) = P(boy) * P(not graduating | boy)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of selecting a boy:\n\nP(boy) = number of boys / total students = 200 / 600 = 1/3\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of a boy not graduating:\n\nP(not graduating | boy) = 1 - P(graduating | boy) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a randomly selected student being a boy who will not graduate:\n\nP(boy and not graduating) = P(boy) * P(not graduating | boy) = (1/3) * 0.15 = 0.05\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from the school is a boy who will not graduate from high school is 0.05 or 5%."
