    "message_1": "A teacher wants to create a schedule for a math competition with 12 participating schools, such that each school competes against every other school exactly once. How many rounds will be needed in the competition?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of rounds needed, we can use the formula for the number of matches in a round-robin tournament: n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of schools participating. In this case, n = 12.\n\nSo, the total number of matches needed is 12(12-1)/2 = 12(11)/2 = 66.\n\nNow, in each round, a school can only compete against one other school. Since there are 12 schools, there can be a maximum of 12/2 = 6 matches per round.\n\nTo find the number of rounds needed, we can divide the total number of matches by the number of matches per round: 66/6 = 11.\n\nTherefore, 11 rounds will be needed for each school to compete against every other school exactly once."
