    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with obligation, permission, and related concepts. It does not typically involve numerical problems that can be solved by students. However, I can provide a sample question related to deontic logic:\n\nIf it is morally obligatory for individuals to pay their taxes, and John is an individual who has not paid his taxes, can we infer that John is morally wrong? (Answer: Yes, if an action is morally obligatory, failing to perform that action is morally wrong.)",
    "message_2": "Thank you for the information about Deontic logic. If you have any mathematical problems or questions, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help you with them."
