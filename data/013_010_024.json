The demand curve in the market is given by Q = 200 - P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price of widgets. The company’s cost function is C(Q) = 2Q. The two other competitors each have the same cost function as the company. Assuming that the competitors act simultaneously, what quantity of widgets should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize its profit, the company needs to find the optimal quantity of widgets to produce, given the market demand curve and its cost function. Since there are two other competitors with the same cost function, we can assume that they will also produce the same quantity of widgets as the company to maximize their profits. Let the quantity produced by each firm be q, then the total quantity produced in the market, Q, is 3q.\n\nThe market demand curve is given by Q = 200 - P. We can rewrite this equation to find the price as a function of the total quantity produced: P = 200 - Q.\n\nSince Q = 3q, we can substitute this into the price equation: P = 200 - 3q.\n\nThe company's revenue (R) is the product of the price and the quantity it produces: R = P * q = (200 - 3q) * q.\n\nThe company's cost function is C(Q) = 2Q. Since Q = 3q, the cost function for the company can be written as C(q) = 2 * 3q = 6q.\n\nThe company's profit (π) is the difference between its revenue and its cost: π = R - C = (200 - 3q) * q - 6q.\n\nTo maximize its profit, the company needs to find the value of q that maximizes this profit function. To do this, we can take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ/dq = (200 - 3q) * 1 + q * (-3) - 6 = 0.\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n200 - 6q - 6 = 0.\n\nSolving for q:\n\n6q = 194.\n\nq = 194 / 6 ≈ 32.33.\n\nSince the company cannot produce a fraction of a widget, it should produce 32 widgets to maximize its profit."
