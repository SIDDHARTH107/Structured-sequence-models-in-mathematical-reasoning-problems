    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, pedestrian-involved accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time (one day) given a known average rate (2 accidents per day).\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events, k is the number of occurrences, λ (lambda) is the average rate, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least one pedestrian accident occurring, which is the complement of the probability of zero accidents occurring. So, we can calculate the probability of zero accidents and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nλ = 2 (average number of accidents per day)\nk = 0 (zero accidents)\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-2) * 2^0) / 0! = (e^(-2) * 1) / 1 = e^(-2) ≈ 0.1353\n\nNow, we find the complement:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.1353 ≈ 0.8647\n\nSo, the probability of at least one pedestrian being involved in a road accident on that road is approximately 0.8647 or 86.47%."
