    "message_1": "One possible question for a math student could be:\n\n\"Suppose the probability of a student passing a math exam if they study for it is 0.8. If a student fails the exam, what is the probability that they did not study?\"\n\nThis question requires the student to apply causal logic principles to solve a probability problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:\n\nA: A student studies for the exam.\nB: A student passes the exam.\n\nWe are given the probability of passing the exam given that the student studied, which is P(B|A) = 0.8. We want to find the probability that a student did not study given that they failed the exam, or P(A'|B').\n\nTo find this, we need some more information. Let's assume the following probabilities:\n\nP(A): The probability that a student studies for the exam.\nP(A'): The probability that a student does not study for the exam.\nP(B|A'): The probability of passing the exam given that the student did not study.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we have:\n\nP(A'|B') = P(B'|A') * P(A') / P(B')\n\nWe also know that:\n\nP(B') = P(B'|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A')\n\nNow, we need the values of P(A), P(A'), and P(B|A'). Let's assume the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.6 (60% of students study for the exam)\nP(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.4 (40% of students do not study for the exam)\nP(B|A') = 0.3 (30% of students who do not study pass the exam)\n\nNow we can calculate P(B'):\n\nP(B') = P(B'|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A')\nP(B') = (1 - 0.8) * 0.6 + (1 - 0.3) * 0.4\nP(B') = 0.2 * 0.6 + 0.7 * 0.4\nP(B') = 0.12 + 0.28\nP(B') = 0.4\n\nFinally, we can calculate P(A'|B') using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A'|B') = P(B'|A') * P(A') / P(B')\nP(A'|B') = (1 - 0.3) * 0.4 / 0.4\nP(A'|B') = 0.7 * 0.4 / 0.4\nP(A'|B') = 0.7\n\nSo, the probability that a student did not study given that they failed the exam is 0.7 or 70%."
