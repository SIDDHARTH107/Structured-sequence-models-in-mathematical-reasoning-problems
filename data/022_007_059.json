Prove that there exists a complex number w such that |w|<A and f(w)=f(0). Hint: Use Liouville's Theorem.",
    "message_2": "To prove the statement, we will use Liouville's Theorem, which states that every bounded entire function (a function that is holomorphic on the entire complex plane) must be constant.\n\nConsider the function g(z) = f(z) - f(0). Since f(z) is entire and f(0) is a constant, g(z) is also entire. Moreover, g(z) is bounded because f(z) is bounded. By Liouville's Theorem, g(z) must be a constant function. Let's denote this constant as C, so g(z) = C for all z in the complex plane.\n\nNow, we have g(z) = f(z) - f(0) = C. Rearranging the equation, we get f(z) = C + f(0). Since g(0) = f(0) - f(0) = 0, we have C = 0. Therefore, f(z) = f(0) for all z in the complex plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the circle with radius A centered at the origin. Since f(z) = f(0) for all z, there must exist a complex number w inside this circle (|w| < A) such that f(w) = f(0). This completes the proof."
