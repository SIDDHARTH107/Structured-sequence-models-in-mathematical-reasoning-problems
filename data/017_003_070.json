    "message_2": "To show that G is a cyclic group, we need to find an element g in G such that the order of g is equal to the order of G, which is 7. In other words, we need to find an element g in G such that g^7 = e (the identity element) and g^k ≠ e for any 1 ≤ k < 7.\n\nSince G is a group of prime order p = 7, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 7. The only element with order 1 is the identity element e.\n\nNow, let's consider any non-identity element g in G. Since the order of g must divide 7, and the only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, the order of g must be 7. This means that g^7 = e and g^k ≠ e for any 1 ≤ k < 7.\n\nThus, any non-identity element g in G is a generator of G, and G is a cyclic group."
