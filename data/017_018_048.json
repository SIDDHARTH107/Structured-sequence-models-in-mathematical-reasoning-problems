    "message_2": "To find all the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 32, we will use the fact that 32 = 2^5. We will consider the number of factors of 2 in the group's order and the structure of the group.\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 32: There is only one isomorphism class of cyclic groups of order 32. A concrete example of a group in this class is Z_32 (the integers modulo 32 under addition).\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: There are two possibilities here: Z_16 x Z_2 and Z_8 x Z_4. These are distinct isomorphism classes, and they are not isomorphic to Z_32.\n\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: There is only one possibility here: Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2. This is not isomorphic to any of the previous groups.\n\n4. Direct product of four cyclic groups: There is only one possibility here: Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2. This is not isomorphic to any of the previous groups.\n\n5. Direct product of five cyclic groups: There is only one possibility here: Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2. This is not isomorphic to any of the previous groups.\n\n6. Quaternion group of order 32: This group, denoted as Q_32, is a non-abelian group of order 32. It is not isomorphic to any of the previous groups.\n\n7. Dihedral group of order 32: This group, denoted as D_32, is a non-abelian group of order 32. It is not isomorphic to any of the previous groups.\n\nIn total, we have found 7 isomorphism classes of groups of order 32:\n\n1. Z_32\n2. Z_16 x Z_2\n3. Z_8 x Z_4\n4. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2\n5. Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n6. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n7. Q_32\n8. D_32"
