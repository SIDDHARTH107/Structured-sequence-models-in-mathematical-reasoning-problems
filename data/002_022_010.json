    "message_1": "A torus has an outer radius of 14 cm and an inner radius of 7 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (outer radius - inner radius), and r is the inner radius of the torus.\n\nIn this case, the outer radius is 14 cm and the inner radius is 7 cm. So, R = (14 - 7) = 7 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 7 * (7^3)\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 7 * 343\nVolume ≈ 2 * (9.8696) * 7 * 343\nVolume ≈ 19.7392 * 7 * 343\nVolume ≈ 137.9744 * 343\nVolume ≈ 47297.9936 cm³\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 47298 cm³."
