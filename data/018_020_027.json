    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of A and B (A ∆ B). The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nIntersection of A and B: A ∩ B = {6, 8, 10}\n\nA ∆ B = (A - A ∩ B) ∪ (B - A ∩ B) = {2, 4} ∪ {12, 14} = {2, 4, 12, 14}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of (A ∆ B) and C: (A ∆ B) ∪ C\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ C = {2, 4, 12, 14} ∪ {2, 8, 10, 16, 18} = {2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18}\n\nSo, the elements in (A ∆ B) ∪ C are {2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18}."
