    "message_1": "Suppose a company's network has 30 computer systems in total. The probability of a computer getting attacked by malware is 0.15, and the probability of a computer getting attacked by a hacker is 0.05. What is the probability that out of the 30 computer systems, exactly 3 will get attacked by malware and 2 will get attacked by a hacker?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nFirst, we will find the probability of exactly 3 computers getting attacked by malware:\n\nn = 30 (total number of computer systems)\nx = 3 (number of computers attacked by malware)\np = 0.15 (probability of a computer getting attacked by malware)\n\nC(30, 3) = 30! / (3! * (30-3)!) = 4060\n\nP(3 malware attacks) = C(30, 3) * 0.15^3 * (1-0.15)^(30-3)\nP(3 malware attacks) = 4060 * 0.15^3 * 0.85^27 ≈ 0.2434\n\nNext, we will find the probability of exactly 2 computers getting attacked by a hacker:\n\nn = 30 (total number of computer systems)\nx = 2 (number of computers attacked by a hacker)\np = 0.05 (probability of a computer getting attacked by a hacker)\n\nC(30, 2) = 30! / (2! * (30-2)!) = 435\n\nP(2 hacker attacks) = C(30, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(30-2)\nP(2 hacker attacks) = 435 * 0.05^2 * 0.95^28 ≈ 0.2784\n\nNow, we will find the probability that both events occur simultaneously. Since the events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities:\n\nP(3 malware attacks and 2 hacker attacks) = P(3 malware attacks) * P(2 hacker attacks)\nP(3 malware attacks and 2 hacker attacks) ≈ 0.2434 * 0.2784 ≈ 0.0678\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 computer systems will get attacked by malware and 2 will get attacked by a hacker is approximately 0.0678 or 6.78%."
