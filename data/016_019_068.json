    "message_2": "The Koch Island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the perimeter of the Koch Island increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nTo find the perimeter after the 4th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Perimeter * (4/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial perimeter is 12 cm, and we want to find the perimeter after the 4th iteration (n = 4).\n\nPerimeter = 12 * (4/3)^4\nPerimeter = 12 * (256/81)\nPerimeter = 3072/81\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 37.93 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch Island after the 4th iteration is approximately 37.93 cm."
