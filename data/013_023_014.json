The amount passed is then tripled and Player B can choose to give any amount back to Player A. Determine the amount of money that Player A should pass to Player B in order to maximize their own earnings assuming that Player B will play to maximize their own earnings as well.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount of money Player A passes to Player B as x. The amount of money that gets tripled is 3x. Now, let's denote the amount of money Player B gives back to Player A as y.\n\nPlayer A's earnings will be: 10 - x + y\nPlayer B's earnings will be: 3x - y\n\nSince both players want to maximize their own earnings, Player B will choose a value of y that maximizes their own earnings (3x - y) without causing Player A to stop passing money. If Player A expects to receive less than the initial $10, they would not pass any money to Player B.\n\nSo, we need to find a value of x and y such that:\n\n1. 10 - x + y >= 10 (Player A's earnings should be at least $10)\n2. 3x - y is maximized (Player B's earnings are maximized)\n\nFrom the first inequality, we get:\n\ny >= x\n\nNow, we want to maximize Player B's earnings (3x - y) while keeping in mind that y >= x.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Player A passes the entire $10 (x = 10), then Player B receives $30 after tripling. In this case, Player B must give back at least $10 to Player A (y = 10) to ensure that Player A is willing to pass the money. Player B's earnings would be 3x - y = 3(10) - 10 = 20.\n\nIf Player A passes any amount less than $10, Player B's earnings will be less than $20, since 3x - y will be less than 3(10) - 10.\n\nTherefore, to maximize their own earnings, Player A should pass the entire $10 to Player B, and Player B should give back $10 to Player A. In this case, Player A's earnings will be $10, and Player B's earnings will be $20."
