    "message_1": "A cookie company claims that their cookies weigh 40 grams each, with a standard deviation of 2 grams. If we randomly select 25 cookies from the company, what is the probability that the average weight of the cookies will be between 39 grams to 41 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The mean of the sampling distribution (μx̄) is equal to the population mean (μ), which is 40 grams.\n\nμx̄ = μ = 40 grams\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx̄) is equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n = 2 grams / √25 = 2 grams / 5 = 0.4 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the range (39 grams and 41 grams, respectively).\n\nz = (x - μx̄) / σx̄\n\nFor the lower bound (39 grams):\n\nz1 = (39 - 40) / 0.4 = -1 / 0.4 = -2.5\n\nFor the upper bound (41 grams):\n\nz2 = (41 - 40) / 0.4 = 1 / 0.4 = 2.5\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table (z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(z1) = P(z = -2.5) ≈ 0.0062\nP(z2) = P(z = 2.5) ≈ 0.9938\n\nFinally, we will find the probability that the average weight of the cookies will be between 39 grams and 41 grams by subtracting the probabilities:\n\nP(39 < x̄ < 41) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.9938 - 0.0062 = 0.9876\n\nSo, there is approximately a 98.76% probability that the average weight of the 25 randomly selected cookies will be between 39 grams and 41 grams."
