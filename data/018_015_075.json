    "message_2": "To find A × B ∩ B × A, we first need to find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A, and then find their intersection.\n\nA × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\nB × A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, B × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}.\n\nNow, we find the intersection of A × B and B × A, which is the set of ordered pairs that are present in both sets. In this case, there is only one such ordered pair: (3, 3).\n\nSo, A × B ∩ B × A = {(3, 3)}."
