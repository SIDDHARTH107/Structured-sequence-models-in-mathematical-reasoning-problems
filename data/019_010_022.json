    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to apply the linear logic rules to the given proof tree. \n\nFirst, let's analyze the proof tree:\n\n1. We have the formula $A \\multimap (B \\& C)$, and we are given that $A = 2$, $B = 4$, and $C = 5$.\n2. The proof tree has two branches: one for $A \\& B$ and one for $C$.\n3. The first branch has three steps: $x:A$, $y:B$, and $x \\& y : A \\& B$.\n4. The second branch has one step: $z:C$.\n5. The final step combines the two branches to get $x \\& y \\multimap z : (A \\& B) \\multimap C$.\n\nNow, let's apply the linear logic rules:\n\n1. In the first branch, we have $x:A$ and $y:B$. Since $A = 2$ and $B = 4$, we can substitute these values to get $x:2$ and $y:4$.\n2. The next step in the first branch is $x \\& y : A \\& B$. This means that $x \\& y$ is a pair of values $(A, B)$. Substituting the values, we get $x \\& y : (2, 4)$.\n3. In the second branch, we have $z:C$. Since $C = 5$, we can substitute this value to get $z:5$.\n4. The final step combines the two branches to get $x \\& y \\multimap z : (A \\& B) \\multimap C$. This means that we have a function that takes a pair of values $(A, B)$ and returns the value $C$. Since we already have the values for $A$, $B$, and $C$, we can substitute them to get $(2, 4) \\multimap 5$.\n\nSo, the result of the given proof tree is $(2, 4) \\multimap 5$."
