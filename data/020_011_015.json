    "message_1": "A company wants to produce two products: Product A has a production cost of $100 per unit and they can sell it for $150 per unit, while Product B has a production cost of $120 per unit and they can sell it for $180 per unit. The company wants to produce at least 400 units in total, but they want to maximize their profit while keeping their total production cost under $54,000. What is the optimal production quantity for each product that will maximize the company's profit while staying within their budget?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 60y, where 50 is the profit per unit of Product A (150 - 100) and 60 is the profit per unit of Product B (180 - 120).\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. Total production cost: 100x + 120y ≤ 54,000\n2. Total units produced: x + y ≥ 400\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities.\n\n1. 100x + 120y ≤ 54,000\nDivide both sides by 20:\n5x + 6y ≤ 2,700\n\n2. x + y ≥ 400\ny ≥ 400 - x\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nA. Intersection of 5x + 6y = 2,700 and y = 400 - x\n5x + 6(400 - x) = 2,700\n5x + 2,400 - 6x = 2,700\n-x = 300\nx = -300 (not valid since x ≥ 0)\n\nB. Intersection of 5x + 6y = 2,700 and x = 0\n5(0) + 6y = 2,700\ny = 450\n\nC. Intersection of y = 400 - x and x = 0\ny = 400 - 0\ny = 400\n\nThe corner points of the feasible region are B(0, 450) and C(0, 400).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 60y at these corner points:\n\nP(0, 450) = 50(0) + 60(450) = 27,000\nP(0, 400) = 50(0) + 60(400) = 24,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $27,000, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of Product A and 450 units of Product B."
