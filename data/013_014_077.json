As the auctioneer, your goal is to design the mechanism that maximizes your revenue. You choose a second-price sealed-bid auction format, where each bidder submits a sealed bid and the painting is awarded to the highest bidder at a price equal to the second-highest bid. The bidders have the following valuations (in dollars) for the painting:\n\n- Alice's valuation = $800\n- Bob's valuation = $1,000\n\nWhat is the revenue you will earn from this auction, assuming both bidders bid truthfully?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, bidders have the incentive to bid truthfully because they only pay the second-highest bid if they win. In this case, Alice's valuation is $800, and Bob's valuation is $1,000.\n\nAssuming both bidders bid truthfully, Alice will bid $800, and Bob will bid $1,000. Since Bob has the highest bid, he will win the auction. However, he will only pay the second-highest bid, which is Alice's bid of $800.\n\nTherefore, the revenue you will earn from this auction is $800."
