    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the transportation algorithm, which is a method for solving the transportation problem in linear programming. The transportation algorithm aims to find the optimal shipping plan that minimizes the total shipping cost while satisfying the supply and demand constraints.\n\nStep 1: Check if the problem is balanced\nFirst, we need to check if the total supply from the factories equals the total demand from the warehouses. If not, we need to add a dummy factory or warehouse to balance the problem.\n\nTotal supply = 30 + 50 + 30 + 20 + 40 + 60 + 20 + 10 = 260\nTotal demand = 10 + 30 + 20 + 40 + 30 + 10 + 50 + 30 = 220\n\nSince the total supply is greater than the total demand, we need to add a dummy warehouse with a demand of 40 to balance the problem.\n\nStep 2: Find the initial basic feasible solution\nThere are several methods to find the initial basic feasible solution, such as the North-West Corner Rule, the Minimum Cost Method, or the Vogel's Approximation Method. We will use the Vogel's Approximation Method in this case, as it generally provides a better initial solution.\n\n1. For each row and column, calculate the penalty cost by subtracting the smallest cost from the second smallest cost.\n2. Select the row or column with the highest penalty cost.\n3. Allocate as much as possible to the cell with the lowest cost in the selected row or column.\n4. Cross out the row or column that has reached its capacity or demand limit and update the remaining capacities and demands.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all capacities and demands are satisfied.\n\nAfter applying the Vogel's Approximation Method, we get the following initial solution:\n\n|           | Warehouse 1 | Warehouse 2 | Warehouse 3 | Warehouse 4 | Warehouse 5 | Warehouse 6 | Warehouse 7 | Warehouse 8 | Dummy Warehouse |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Factory 1 | 0           | 0           | 30          | 0           | 40          | 60          | 0           | 0           | 130             |\n| Factory 2 | 0           | 30          | 0           | 40          | 0           | 0           | 50          | 0           | 120             |\n| Factory 3 | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 20          | 40          | 0           | 10          | 70              |\n| Factory 4 | 10          | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 10          | 30          | 50              |\n| Factory 5 | 0           | 0           | 20          | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 20          | 40              |\n\nStep 3: Check for optimality and improve the solution\n1. Calculate the row and column dual variables (u and v) using the costs of the allocated cells.\n2. Calculate the opportunity costs (w) for the unallocated cells using the formula w = c - u - v.\n3. If all opportunity costs are greater than or equal to zero, the solution is optimal. Otherwise, select the cell with the most negative opportunity cost and form a loop with the allocated cells.\n4. Determine the minimum allocation in the loop and reallocate the cells by adding or subtracting the minimum allocation.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all opportunity costs are greater than or equal to zero.\n\nAfter applying these steps, we find that the initial solution is already optimal. Therefore, the optimal shipping plan is as follows:\n\n|           | Warehouse 1 | Warehouse 2 | Warehouse 3 | Warehouse 4 | Warehouse 5 | Warehouse 6 | Warehouse 7 | Warehouse 8 |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Factory 1 | 0           | 0           | 30          | 0           | 40          | 60          | 0           | 0           |\n| Factory 2 | 0           | 30          | 0           | 40          | 0           | 0           | 50          | 0           |\n| Factory 3 | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 20          | 40          | 0           | 10          |\n| Factory 4 | 10          | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 10          | 30          |\n| Factory 5 | 0           | 0           | 20          | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 20          |\n\nThe total shipping cost for this optimal plan is:\n\n(30 * 9) + (40 * 7) + (60 * 12) + (30 * 8) + (40 * 10) + (50 * 8) + (20 * 10) + (40 * 8) + (10 * 11) + (10 * 9) + (30 * 12) + (20 * 8) = 2710."
