    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the particle, we need to find the first derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity function v(t).\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(3t^2 - 2t + 1)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = 6t - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 2 seconds. We plug t = 2 into the velocity function:\n\nv(2) = 6(2) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 10 m/s.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the particle. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t, which is the first derivative of the velocity function v(t) with respect to time t:\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t - 2)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 6\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, so the acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds is the same as its acceleration at any other time:\n\na(2) = 6 m/s²\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 6 m/s²."
