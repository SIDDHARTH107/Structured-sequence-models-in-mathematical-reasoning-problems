The company has a dataset of the number of purchases made by each customer in the last year. Using K-means clustering with K=3, cluster the customers based on their purchase behavior. The dataset is given below:\n\n| Customer ID | Number of Purchases |\n|-------------|---------------------|\n| 1           | 18                  |\n| 2           | 12                  |\n| 3           | 20                  |\n| 4           | 5                   |\n| 5           | 15                  |\n| 6           | 25                  |\n| 7           | 10                  |\n| 8           | 8                   |\n| 9           | 16                  |\n| 10          | 22                  |\n\nWhich customers fall into each cluster? What is the average number of purchases made by customers in each cluster?",
    "message_2": "To perform K-means clustering, we first need to initialize the centroids. We can randomly select K data points as the initial centroids. Let's choose the following initial centroids:\n\n1. Centroid 1: 18 (Customer 1)\n2. Centroid 2: 12 (Customer 2)\n3. Centroid 3: 20 (Customer 3)\n\nNow, we'll assign each data point to the nearest centroid and update the centroids by calculating the mean of the data points in each cluster.\n\nIteration 1:\n1. Cluster 1: [18]\n2. Cluster 2: [12, 5, 15, 10, 8]\n3. Cluster 3: [20, 25, 16, 22]\n\nUpdated centroids:\n1. Centroid 1: 18\n2. Centroid 2: (12 + 5 + 15 + 10 + 8) / 5 = 10\n3. Centroid 3: (20 + 25 + 16 + 22) / 4 = 20.75\n\nIteration 2:\n1. Cluster 1: [18, 15, 16]\n2. Cluster 2: [12, 5, 10, 8]\n3. Cluster 3: [20, 25, 22]\n\nUpdated centroids:\n1. Centroid 1: (18 + 15 + 16) / 3 = 16.33\n2. Centroid 2: (12 + 5 + 10 + 8) / 4 = 8.75\n3. Centroid 3: (20 + 25 + 22) / 3 = 22.33\n\nNo more changes in the clusters, so the final clusters are:\n\n1. Cluster 1: [18, 15, 16] (Customers 1, 5, 9)\n2. Cluster 2: [12, 5, 10, 8] (Customers 2, 4, 7, 8)\n3. Cluster 3: [20, 25, 22] (Customers 3, 6, 10)\n\nThe average number of purchases made by customers in each cluster:\n\n1. Cluster 1: (18 + 15 + 16) / 3 = 16.33\n2. Cluster 2: (12 + 5 + 10 + 8) / 4 = 8.75\n3. Cluster 3: (20 + 25 + 22) / 3 = 22.33"
