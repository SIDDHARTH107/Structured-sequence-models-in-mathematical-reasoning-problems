    "message_2": "a) All the poles of f(z)\n\nA pole of a meromorphic function is a point where the function becomes infinite. In this case, f(z) has poles where the denominator is zero. So, we need to find the zeros of the denominator:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nThe poles are at z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nb) Determine the order of each pole and classify them as simple, double, etc.\n\nThe order of a pole is the multiplicity of the zero in the denominator. In this case, both factors (z - 1) and (z + 1) have multiplicity 1, so both poles are of order 1. They are classified as simple poles.\n\nc) Determine the residue of each pole\n\nThe residue of a simple pole at z = z0 can be found using the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z0] = lim (z -> z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\nFor z = 1:\n\nRes[f(z), 1] = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (z^4 - 4z^2 + 5)/(z^2 - 1)]\n= lim (z -> 1) [(z^4 - 4z^2 + 5)/(z + 1)]\n= (1^4 - 4*1^2 + 5)/(1 + 1)\n= 2/2\n= 1\n\nFor z = -1:\n\nRes[f(z), -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * (z^4 - 4z^2 + 5)/(z^2 - 1)]\n= lim (z -> -1) [(z^4 - 4z^2 + 5)/(z - 1)]\n= ((-1)^4 - 4*(-1)^2 + 5)/((-1) - 1)\n= 1/-2\n= -1/2\n\nSo, the residues are 1 at z = 1 and -1/2 at z = -1.\n\nd) Classify f(z) according to Mittag-Leffler Theorem.\n\nThe Mittag-Leffler Theorem states that a meromorphic function can be represented as the sum of a holomorphic function and a sum of simple poles with their residues. In this case, f(z) can be written as:\n\nf(z) = g(z) + Res[f(z), 1]/(z - 1) + Res[f(z), -1]/(z + 1)\n\nwhere g(z) is a holomorphic function. Since f(z) has only simple poles and we have found their residues, it can be classified according to the Mittag-Leffler Theorem as:\n\nf(z) = g(z) + 1/(z - 1) - 1/2(z + 1)\n\nwhere g(z) is a holomorphic function."
