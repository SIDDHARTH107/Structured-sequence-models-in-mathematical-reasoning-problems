Suppose that A and X/A are both path-connected, where X/A denotes the quotient space formed by identifying all points of A to a single point. Prove that X is path-connected.\n\nQuestion for the math student: \nLet X be a topological space and let A be a connected subset of X. If A is a line segment between (1,1) and (3,3) in the plane and X is the union of A with the two vertical segments from (1,1) to (1,4) and from (3,3) to (3,0), show that X is path-connected.",
    "message_2": "Proof that X is path-connected:\n\nLet x, y be any two points in X. We need to show that there exists a continuous path connecting x and y in X.\n\nCase 1: Both x and y are in A.\nSince A is path-connected, there exists a continuous path from x to y in A, which is also a continuous path in X.\n\nCase 2: x is in A and y is not in A.\nWithout loss of generality, let y be in the vertical segment from (1,1) to (1,4). Since A is path-connected, there exists a continuous path from x to (1,1) in A. We can then extend this path to y by following the vertical segment from (1,1) to y. This is a continuous path in X.\n\nCase 3: x and y are not in A.\nWithout loss of generality, let x be in the vertical segment from (1,1) to (1,4) and y be in the vertical segment from (3,3) to (3,0). We can construct a continuous path from x to (1,1), then from (1,1) to (3,3) in A, and finally from (3,3) to y. This is a continuous path in X.\n\nIn all cases, we have shown that there exists a continuous path connecting x and y in X. Therefore, X is path-connected."
