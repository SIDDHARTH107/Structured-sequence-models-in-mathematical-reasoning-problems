    "message_2": "To determine which player has the advantage, let's analyze the possible sums of three numbers that are multiples of 3.\n\nThe multiples of 3 in the given set are {3, 6}. The other numbers are {1, 2, 4, 5}. We can form the following groups of three numbers whose sum is a multiple of 3:\n\n1. {1, 2, 6}\n2. {1, 3, 5}\n3. {1, 4, 4}\n4. {2, 3, 4}\n5. {2, 5, 5}\n6. {3, 3, 6}\n7. {4, 5, 6}\n\nNotice that the groups {1, 4, 4} and {2, 5, 5} are not valid since the numbers 4 and 5 can only be chosen once. Also, the group {3, 3, 6} is not valid since the number 3 can only be chosen once.\n\nSo, we are left with the following valid groups:\n\n1. {1, 2, 6}\n2. {1, 3, 5}\n3. {2, 3, 4}\n4. {4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible outcomes for each player:\n\nPlayer 1 picks first and Player 2 picks second.\n\n1. If Player 1 picks 1, Player 2 can pick 3 to block {1, 3, 5} or pick 2 to block {1, 2, 6}. In either case, Player 1 cannot win in the next turn.\n2. If Player 1 picks 2, Player 2 can pick 1 to block {1, 2, 6} or pick 3 to block {2, 3, 4}. In either case, Player 1 cannot win in the next turn.\n3. If Player 1 picks 3, Player 2 can pick 1 to block {1, 3, 5} or pick 2 to block {2, 3, 4}. In either case, Player 1 cannot win in the next turn.\n4. If Player 1 picks 4, Player 2 can pick 5 to block {4, 5, 6} or pick 2 to block {2, 3, 4}. In either case, Player 1 cannot win in the next turn.\n5. If Player 1 picks 5, Player 2 can pick 4 to block {4, 5, 6} or pick 1 to block {1, 3, 5}. In either case, Player 1 cannot win in the next turn.\n6. If Player 1 picks 6, Player 2 can pick 1 to block {1, 2, 6} or pick 4 to block {4, 5, 6}. In either case, Player 1 cannot win in the next turn.\n\nIn all cases, Player 1 cannot win in their second turn. However, Player 2 has the opportunity to win in their second turn, depending on the numbers chosen by both players. Therefore, Player 2 has the advantage in this game."
