    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations. It is based on the idea of updating the values of the variables in parallel using the previous iteration's values. Let's apply the Jacobi method to the given system of linear equations:\n\n3x + y = 13\nx + 2y = 8\n\nFirst, we rearrange the equations to isolate x and y:\n\nx = (13 - y) / 3\ny = (8 - x) / 2\n\nNow, we initialize the variables x and y with some initial values, usually zeros:\n\nx0 = 0\ny0 = 0\n\nNext, we use the Jacobi iterative method to update the values of x and y:\n\nx1 = (13 - y0) / 3\ny1 = (8 - x0) / 2\n\nWe continue this process until the values of x and y converge to a certain level of accuracy. In this case, we want the solution to be accurate to 3 decimal places. Let's perform the iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (13 - 0) / 3 = 4.333\ny1 = (8 - 0) / 2 = 4\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (13 - 4) / 3 = 3\ny2 = (8 - 4.333) / 2 = 1.833\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (13 - 1.833) / 3 = 3.722\ny3 = (8 - 3) / 2 = 2.5\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = (13 - 2.5) / 3 = 3.5\ny4 = (8 - 3.722) / 2 = 2.139\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = (13 - 2.139) / 3 = 3.62\ny5 = (8 - 3.5) / 2 = 2.25\n\nIteration 6:\nx6 = (13 - 2.25) / 3 = 3.583\ny6 = (8 - 3.62) / 2 = 2.19\n\nAt this point, the values of x and y have converged to 3 decimal places:\n\nx = 3.583\ny = 2.190\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations using the Jacobi iterative method to 3 decimal places is:\n\nx = 3.583\ny = 2.190"
