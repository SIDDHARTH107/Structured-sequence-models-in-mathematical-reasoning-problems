    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) using the power rule, we differentiate each term with respect to x. The power rule states that if you have a function in the form of y = ax^n, then its derivative is y' = n*ax^(n-1).\n\nSo, let's differentiate each term of f(x):\n\n1. The derivative of 3x^5 is 5 * 3x^(5-1) = 15x^4.\n2. The derivative of -7x^3 is 3 * (-7)x^(3-1) = -21x^2.\n3. The derivative of 8x^2 is 2 * 8x^(2-1) = 16x.\n4. The derivative of -2x is -2 (since the power of x is 1).\n5. The derivative of the constant term -6 is 0 (constants have no effect on the derivative).\n\nNow, let's combine these derivatives to get the derivative of f(x), which is f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 15x^4 - 21x^2 + 16x - 2\n\nNow, we need to calculate f'(2):\n\nf'(2) = 15(2)^4 - 21(2)^2 + 16(2) - 2\nf'(2) = 15(16) - 21(4) + 32 - 2\nf'(2) = 240 - 84 + 32 - 2\nf'(2) = 186\n\nSo, f'(2) = 186."
