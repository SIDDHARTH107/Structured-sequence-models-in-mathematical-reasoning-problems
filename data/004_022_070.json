What should be the dimensions of the can so that it is as cheap as possible? (Assume that π = 22/7 and the height of the can be 2 times the radius)",
    "message_2": "Let the radius of the cylindrical can be r and the height be h. Since the height is 2 times the radius, we have h = 2r.\n\nThe volume of the cylinder is given by V = πr^2h. Since we want to store 1 liter of oil, which is equivalent to 1000 cubic centimeters, we have:\n\n1000 = (22/7)r^2(2r)\n\nNow, we need to find the surface area of the can. The surface area of a cylinder is given by A = 2πr^2 + 2πrh. Since the material for the top and bottom is twice the cost of the material used for the curved surface, we can write the cost function as:\n\nC(r) = 2(2πr^2) + 2πrh = 4πr^2 + 4πr^2 = 8πr^2\n\nOur goal is to minimize the cost function C(r) subject to the constraint given by the volume equation. To do this, we can use the volume equation to eliminate h and express r in terms of V:\n\n1000 = (22/7)r^3\nr^3 = (1000 * 7) / 22\nr^3 ≈ 318.18\nr ≈ 6.83 cm (approximately)\n\nNow we can find the height using h = 2r:\n\nh ≈ 2 * 6.83 ≈ 13.66 cm (approximately)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the can that minimize the cost are approximately r = 6.83 cm and h = 13.66 cm."
