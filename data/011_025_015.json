The player who removes the last marble wins the game. \n\nIf there are 20 marbles in the pile at the beginning of the game, and Player 1 goes first, how many possible game outcomes are there?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of possible game outcomes, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a function F(n) as the number of possible game outcomes when there are n marbles left in the pile. We can express F(n) in terms of F(n-1), F(n-2), and F(n-3), since a player can remove 1, 2, or 3 marbles in each turn.\n\nBase cases:\nF(0) = 0 (no marbles left)\nF(1) = 1 (only one possible outcome: Player 1 takes the last marble)\nF(2) = 2 (two possible outcomes: Player 1 takes 1 marble and Player 2 takes the last marble, or Player 1 takes both marbles)\nF(3) = 4 (four possible outcomes: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 2; P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 1; P1 takes 2, P2 takes 1; P1 takes all 3 marbles)\n\nRecursive formula:\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) + F(n-3)\n\nNow we can calculate F(20) using the recursive formula:\n\nF(4) = F(3) + F(2) + F(1) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3) + F(2) = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13\nF(6) = F(5) + F(4) + F(3) = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24\n...\nContinue this process until we reach F(20).\n\nF(20) = F(19) + F(18) + F(17) = 6728\n\nSo there are 6728 possible game outcomes when there are 20 marbles in the pile and Player 1 goes first."
