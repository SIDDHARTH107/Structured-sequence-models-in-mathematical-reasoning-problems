    "message_1": "A bird is perched on a tree branch that is 20 meters high. It spots a worm on the ground and decides to swoop down and grab it. The angle of depression from the bird to the worm is 35 degrees. How far away is the worm from the base of the tree?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have a right triangle with the tree as one side, the ground as the base, and the bird's line of sight to the worm as the hypotenuse. We are given the angle of depression (35 degrees) and the height of the tree (20 meters). We want to find the distance from the base of the tree to the worm, which is the base of the triangle.\n\nSince we have the angle of depression and the opposite side (the height of the tree), we can use the tangent function to find the adjacent side (the distance from the base of the tree to the worm).\n\nThe tangent function is defined as:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn our case:\n\ntan(35 degrees) = 20 meters / adjacent side\n\nTo find the adjacent side, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nAdjacent side = 20 meters / tan(35 degrees)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for the adjacent side:\n\nAdjacent side ≈ 20 meters / 0.7002\nAdjacent side ≈ 28.57 meters\n\nSo, the worm is approximately 28.57 meters away from the base of the tree."
