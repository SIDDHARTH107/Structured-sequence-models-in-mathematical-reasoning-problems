    "message_2": "A group G of order 10 has the form G = Z_10 or G = D_5, where Z_10 is the cyclic group of order 10 and D_5 is the dihedral group of order 10. However, both Z_10 and D_5 are abelian groups, so there is no non-abelian group of order 10 that is not isomorphic to C10 or D5. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of order 2 in a non-abelian group G of order 10, which is not isomorphic to C10 or D5, is 0."
