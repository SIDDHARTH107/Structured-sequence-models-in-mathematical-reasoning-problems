    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 2x\n\nx^2 = x\n\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nThe points of intersection are x = 0 and x = 1.\n\nNow, we will find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions from x = 0 to x = 1:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2 - x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we will integrate the function:\n\nArea = [x^2 - (2/3)x^3] evaluated from 0 to 1\n\nArea = [(1)^2 - (2/3)(1)^3] - [(0)^2 - (2/3)(0)^3]\n\nArea = [1 - (2/3)] - [0]\n\nArea = 1/3\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 is 1/3 square units."
