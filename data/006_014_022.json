    "message_1": "A certain electronic system has 4 major components, each with a probability of failing independently. The probability of component A failing is 0.2, component B failing is 0.1, component C failing is 0.3, and component D failing is 0.15. What is the probability that the entire system fails?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the entire system fails, we need to find the probability that all four components fail simultaneously. Since the components fail independently, we can multiply their individual probabilities of failure together.\n\nThe probability of the entire system failing is:\n\nP(A and B and C and D) = P(A) * P(B) * P(C) * P(D) = 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.0009\n\nSo, the probability that the entire system fails is 0.0009 or 0.09%."
