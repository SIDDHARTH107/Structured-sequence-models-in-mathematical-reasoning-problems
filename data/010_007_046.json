    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of the space S¹/p, we will first analyze the map p: S¹ → S¹ given by p(z) = z². Notice that p is a 2-fold covering map, as each point in the target space S¹ has exactly two pre-images in the domain S¹ (since z and -z have the same square).\n\nNow, let q: S¹ → S¹/p be the induced surjective map. We want to find the fundamental group of the space S¹/p, denoted by π₁(S¹/p). To do this, we will use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: Let p: X → Y be a covering map, and let x ∈ X and y ∈ Y with p(x) = y. Then the map p_*: π₁(X, x) → π₁(Y, y) induced by p is surjective, and its kernel is the image of the map φ: π₁(F_x) → π₁(X, x), where F_x is the fiber of x.\n\nIn our case, X = S¹, Y = S¹/p, p = p, and F_x = {z, -z}. The fundamental group of the unit circle S¹ is isomorphic to the integers, π₁(S¹) ≅ ℤ, generated by a loop going once around the circle. Let's denote this loop by a.\n\nNow, let's compute the kernel of the map p_*: π₁(S¹) → π₁(S¹/p). Since p(z) = z², the loop a in S¹ is mapped to a loop in S¹/p that goes around the circle twice. Let's denote this loop by b. Then, p_*(a) = b². The kernel of p_* consists of elements in π₁(S¹) that are mapped to the identity in π₁(S¹/p). Notice that p_*(2a) = b² = p_*(a)², so 2a is in the kernel of p_*. Moreover, any loop in S¹ that is not a multiple of 2a will not be mapped to the identity in S¹/p. Therefore, the kernel of p_* is the subgroup of π₁(S¹) generated by 2a, which is isomorphic to 2ℤ.\n\nBy the theorem mentioned earlier, we have that π₁(S¹/p) ≅ π₁(S¹) / (2ℤ) ≅ ℤ/2ℤ, which is the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nNow, let's describe the covering spaces of S¹/p that correspond to the subgroups of π₁(S¹/p). Since π₁(S¹/p) ≅ ℤ/2ℤ, there are only two subgroups: the trivial subgroup {0} and the whole group ℤ/2ℤ.\n\n1. The covering space corresponding to the trivial subgroup {0} is the universal cover of S¹/p, which is homeomorphic to ℝ. This covering space is an infinite helix, with each loop of the helix corresponding to a loop in S¹/p.\n\n2. The covering space corresponding to the whole group ℤ/2ℤ is the original space S¹. This is because the covering map p: S¹ → S¹/p has the property that p_*(π₁(S¹)) = π₁(S¹/p).\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental group of the space S¹/p is the cyclic group of order 2, π₁(S¹/p) ≅ ℤ/2ℤ. The covering spaces of S¹/p that correspond to the subgroups of π₁(S¹/p) are the infinite helix ℝ and the original space S¹."
