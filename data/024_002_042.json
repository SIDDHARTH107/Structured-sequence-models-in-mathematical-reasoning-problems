    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, we can use the great-circle distance formula. First, we need to convert the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) to spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), where r is the radius, θ is the polar angle (co-latitude), and φ is the azimuthal angle (longitude).\n\nFor the point (0, 0, 5), we have:\nr1 = 5\nθ1 = arccos(z1/r1) = arccos(5/5) = arccos(1) = 0\nφ1 = arctan2(y1, x1) = arctan2(0, 0) = 0 (undefined, but we can set it to 0)\n\nFor the point (3, 4, 0), we have:\nr2 = sqrt(x2^2 + y2^2 + z2^2) = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 0^2) = 5\nθ2 = arccos(z2/r2) = arccos(0/5) = arccos(0) = π/2\nφ2 = arctan2(y2, x2) = arctan2(4, 3) = arctan(4/3)\n\nNow, we can use the great-circle distance formula:\nd = r * arccos(sin(θ1) * sin(θ2) * cos(φ1 - φ2) + cos(θ1) * cos(θ2))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nd = 5 * arccos(sin(0) * sin(π/2) * cos(0 - arctan(4/3)) + cos(0) * cos(π/2))\nd = 5 * arccos(0 + 1 * 0)\nd = 5 * arccos(0)\nd = 5 * (π/2)\n\nSo, the shortest distance between the two points on the surface of the sphere is 5 * (π/2) units.\n\nTo determine the geodesic curve connecting these points, we can use the parametric equation of a great circle:\n\nx(t) = r * (cos(θ1) * cos(θ2) * cos(t) + sin(θ1) * sin(θ2) * cos(φ1 - φ2) * cos(t) - sin(θ1) * sin(θ2) * sin(φ1 - φ2) * sin(t))\ny(t) = r * (cos(θ1) * sin(θ2) * cos(t) + sin(θ1) * cos(θ2) * cos(φ1 - φ2) * cos(t) + sin(θ1) * cos(θ2) * sin(φ1 - φ2) * sin(t))\nz(t) = r * (-sin(θ1) * cos(t) + cos(θ1) * cos(φ1 - φ2) * cos(t) + cos(θ1) * sin(φ1 - φ2) * sin(t))\n\nwhere t ∈ [0, 1]. The curve will be traced out as t varies from 0 to 1."
