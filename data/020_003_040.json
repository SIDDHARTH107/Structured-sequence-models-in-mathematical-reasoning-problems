    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit from each unit of Product A is $6 and the profit from each unit of Product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 300 units per day, and they require at least two machines of type X and at least three machines of type Y to produce all of their products. Each unit of Product A requires one machine of type X and two machines of type Y, while each unit of Product B requires three machines of type X and one machine of type Y. What is the maximum daily profit that the company can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 6x + 8y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 300 (maximum of 300 units per day)\n2. x + 3y ≥ 2 (at least two machines of type X)\n3. 2x + y ≥ 3 (at least three machines of type Y)\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for these constraints. We can rewrite the inequalities as:\n\n1. y ≤ 300 - x\n2. y ≥ (2 - x) / 3\n3. y ≥ 3 - 2x\n\nNow we can find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersections of these lines:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\ny = 300 - x\ny = (2 - x) / 3\n=> x = 299/2, y = 1/2\n\nIntersection of (1) and (3):\ny = 300 - x\ny = 3 - 2x\n=> x = 299, y = 1\n\nIntersection of (2) and (3):\ny = (2 - x) / 3\ny = 3 - 2x\n=> x = 1, y = 1/3\n\nNow we need to evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\nP(299/2, 1/2) = 6(299/2) + 8(1/2) = 897 + 4 = 901\nP(299, 1) = 6(299) + 8(1) = 1794 + 8 = 1802\nP(1, 1/3) = 6(1) + 8(1/3) = 6 + 8/3 = 18 + 8/3 = 26/3\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (299, 1), with a profit of $1802 per day."
