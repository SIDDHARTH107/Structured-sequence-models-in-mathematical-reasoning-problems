    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2) * x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find (dy/dx)^2:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = ((3/2) * x^(1/2))^2 = (9/4) * x\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of (1 + (dy/dx)^2):\n\nsqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = sqrt(1 + (9/4) * x)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula and evaluate the integral:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] sqrt(1 + (9/4) * x) dx\n\nThis integral does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we will need to use a numerical method to approximate the arc length. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integration calculator, we get:\n\nL ≈ 6.51\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4 is approximately 6.51."
