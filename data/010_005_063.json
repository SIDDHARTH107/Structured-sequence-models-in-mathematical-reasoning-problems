    "message_2": "First, let's recall the definitions of connected and path-connected.\n\nA topological space X is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In other words, there is no separation of X into two disjoint open sets.\n\nA topological space X is path-connected if for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nNow, let's consider the set A = {1/n | n is a positive integer} in the topological space X with the finite complement topology on the real line. In the finite complement topology, a set is open if its complement in the space is either finite or the whole space.\n\nTo determine if A is connected or path-connected, we will analyze each property separately.\n\n1. Connectedness:\n\nSuppose A is not connected. Then there exist two disjoint non-empty open sets U and V such that A = U ∪ V. Since U and V are open in the subspace topology on A, there exist open sets U' and V' in X such that U = A ∩ U' and V = A ∩ V'. Note that U' ∪ V' is an open set in X containing A, and its complement in X is finite.\n\nHowever, since U and V are disjoint, we have that A ⊆ U' ∪ V' ⊆ X, and the complement of U' ∪ V' in X is the complement of A in X, which is an infinite set (it contains all real numbers except the elements of A). This is a contradiction since we assumed the complement of U' ∪ V' is finite. Therefore, our assumption that A is not connected must be false, and A is connected.\n\n2. Path-connectedness:\n\nTo show that A is not path-connected, we will prove that there is no continuous path between two distinct points in A.\n\nLet x = 1/n and y = 1/m be two distinct points in A, with n, m positive integers and n ≠ m. Assume there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → A such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nSince f is continuous and [0, 1] is connected in the standard topology on the real line, the image of f, f([0, 1]), must be connected in X. However, f([0, 1]) contains at least two distinct points x and y, and since A is a discrete set in the finite complement topology (each point is an open set), f([0, 1]) cannot be connected. This is a contradiction, so there is no continuous path between x and y in A.\n\nTherefore, A is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the set A = {1/n | n is a positive integer} is connected but not path-connected in the topological space X with the finite complement topology on the real line."
