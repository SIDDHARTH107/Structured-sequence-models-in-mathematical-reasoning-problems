    "message_2": "To find the mean, median, and mode of this time series, we will follow these steps:\n\nMean:\n1. Add up all the numbers in the dataset.\n2. Divide the sum by the total number of data points (in this case, 12 months).\n\nMedian:\n1. Arrange the numbers in ascending order (which is already done in this case).\n2. Since there are 12 data points (an even number), find the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nMode:\n1. Identify the number(s) that appear most frequently in the dataset.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nMean:\n(25 + 27 + 30 + 34 + 38 + 42 + 45 + 49 + 52 + 55 + 57 + 60) / 12 = 516 / 12 = 43\n\nMedian:\n(38 + 42) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40\n\nMode:\nThere is no repeating number in the dataset, so there is no mode.\n\nSo, the mean is 43, the median is 40, and there is no mode."
