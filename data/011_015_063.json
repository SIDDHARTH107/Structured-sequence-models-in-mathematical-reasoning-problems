    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. We will consider one person in the party and analyze their relationships with the other 5 people.\n\nSince there is no group of three people who all know each other and no group of three people who are all strangers, each person must have exactly 2 friends and 3 strangers, or 3 friends and 2 strangers among the other 5 people at the party.\n\nLet's assume that one person, A, has 3 friends (B, C, and D) and 2 strangers (E and F) among the other 5 people.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationships between B, C, and D. If any two of them are friends (say B and C), then A, B, and C would form a group of three people who all know each other, which is not allowed. Therefore, B, C, and D must all be strangers to each other.\n\nHowever, this creates a group of three people (B, C, and D) who are all strangers, which is also not allowed.\n\nThis contradiction means that our initial assumption that one person has 3 friends and 2 strangers among the other 5 people is not possible. Therefore, in a party with 6 people, at least 4 people must know each other or be strangers."
