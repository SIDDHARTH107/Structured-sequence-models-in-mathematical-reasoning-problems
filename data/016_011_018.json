    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, and its perimeter increases with each iteration. To find the ratio of the perimeter of the 5th iteration to the 4th iteration, we need to understand how the perimeter changes with each iteration.\n\nIn the Vicsek fractal, each square is divided into 9 smaller squares, with 5 of them being filled in the next iteration. The side length of each smaller square is 1/3 of the side length of the original square.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the nth iteration as P(n). In the first iteration, there is only one square, so the perimeter is P(1) = 4 * side length.\n\nIn the second iteration, each side of the original square is replaced by 3 smaller sides, each with a length of 1/3 of the original side length. So, the perimeter of the second iteration is P(2) = 4 * 3 * (1/3) * side length = 4 * side length.\n\nIn general, for the nth iteration, the perimeter is P(n) = 4 * 3^(n-1) * (1/3)^(n-1) * side length.\n\nNow, we want to find the ratio of the perimeter of the 5th iteration to the 4th iteration:\n\nP(5) / P(4) = [4 * 3^(5-1) * (1/3)^(5-1) * side length] / [4 * 3^(4-1) * (1/3)^(4-1) * side length]\n\nThe side length and the 4 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nP(5) / P(4) = [3^(5-1) * (1/3)^(5-1)] / [3^(4-1) * (1/3)^(4-1)]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nP(5) / P(4) = [3^4 * (1/3)^4] / [3^3 * (1/3)^3]\n\nDivide the terms:\n\nP(5) / P(4) = 3\n\nSo, the ratio of the perimeter of the 5th iteration of the Vicsek fractal to the perimeter of the 4th iteration is 3:1."
