    "message_1": "Let X be a non-singular projective curve of genus 2 over the field of complex numbers. Let D = P + Q where P and Q are distinct points on X. If deg(D) = 2, then using Riemann-Roch theorem, find the dimension of the space of all rational functions f in k(X) such that div(f)+D≥0.",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of all rational functions f in k(X) such that div(f) + D ≥ 0, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on a non-singular projective curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of rational functions with divisor at least D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nIn our case, the curve X has genus g = 2, and the divisor D = P + Q has degree deg(D) = 2. The canonical divisor K has degree deg(K) = 2g - 2 = 2(2) - 2 = 2.\n\nNow, we want to find l(D), the dimension of the space of rational functions with divisor at least D. Using the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\nl(D) - l(K - (P + Q)) = 2 + 1 - 2\nl(D) - l(K - P - Q) = 1\n\nTo find l(K - P - Q), we need to consider the degree of the divisor K - P - Q. Since deg(K) = 2 and deg(P + Q) = 2, we have deg(K - P - Q) = 2 - 2 = 0. For a divisor of degree 0, l(K - P - Q) is either 0 or 1. If l(K - P - Q) = 1, then there exists a non-constant rational function with divisor at least K - P - Q, which would imply that X has genus 0 or 1, contradicting our assumption that X has genus 2. Therefore, we must have l(K - P - Q) = 0.\n\nNow, we can find l(D) using the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K - P - Q) = 1\nl(D) - 0 = 1\nl(D) = 1\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of all rational functions f in k(X) such that div(f) + D ≥ 0 is 1."
