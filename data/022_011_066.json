    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two zeros:\n\nz1 = 1 (order 1)\nz2 = -1 (order 1)\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^3 - 8 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0\n\nThis gives us one real pole and two complex poles:\n\np1 = 2 (order 1)\n\nFor the complex poles, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 4 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nz = (-2 ± √(-2)^2 - 4(1)(4)) / 2(1)\nz = (-2 ± √(4 - 16)) / 2\nz = (-2 ± √(-12)) / 2\nz = -1 ± √3i\n\nThis gives us two complex poles:\n\np2 = -1 + √3i (order 1)\np3 = -1 - √3i (order 1)\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) has two zeros (1 and -1) and three poles (2, -1 + √3i, and -1 - √3i), all of order 1."
