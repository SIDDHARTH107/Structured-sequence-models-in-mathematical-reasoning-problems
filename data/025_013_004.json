    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian matrix of the curve C at the point (-1, 0), we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. The equation of the curve C is given by:\n\nF(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 3x - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 3\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (-1, 0):\n\n∂F/∂x(-1, 0) = -3(-1)^2 + 3 = 0\n∂F/∂y(-1, 0) = 2(0) = 0\n\nFinally, we form the Jacobian matrix J at the point (-1, 0):\n\nJ = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n      |    0         0    |\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix of the curve C at the point (-1, 0) is:\n\nJ = | 0  0 |"
