    "message_1": "Consider the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}= D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + f(u),$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $f(u)$ is a reaction term. Given the initial condition $u(x,0)=x(1-x)$ and the boundary conditions $u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0$, find the solution $u(x,t)$ for $t>0$ and $0\\leq x\\leq 1$ if  $D=0.01$ and $f(u)=u(1-u)$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the reaction-diffusion equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = D X''(x)T(t) + X(x)T(t)(1 - X(x)T(t)).$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = D \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + (1 - X(x)T(t)).$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = -k^2, \\quad D \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + (1 - X(x)T(t)) = -k^2.$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $T'(t) + k^2 T(t) = 0$,\n2) $D X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = X(x)(1 - X(x)T(t))$.\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$$T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2 t},$$\n\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant.\n\nNow, we need to solve the second equation:\n\n$$D X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = X(x)(1 - X(x)T(t)).$$\n\nSince $T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2 t}$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$D X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = X(x)(1 - X(x)C_1 e^{-k^2 t}).$$\n\nThis equation is nonlinear, and it is difficult to find an exact solution. However, we can try to find an approximate solution using perturbation methods or numerical methods.\n\nFor now, let's assume that the solution can be written as a Fourier series:\n\n$$X(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin(n \\pi x),$$\n\nwhere $A_n$ are coefficients to be determined. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n$$D \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (n \\pi)^2 A_n \\sin(n \\pi x) + k^2 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin(n \\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin(n \\pi x)(1 - \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty A_m \\sin(m \\pi x)C_1 e^{-k^2 t}).$$\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of $\\sin(n \\pi x)$, we can find the coefficients $A_n$. Then, the solution can be written as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin(n \\pi x) C_1 e^{-k^2 t}.$$\n\nThe initial condition $u(x,0) = x(1-x)$ can be used to find the coefficients $A_n$ and the constant $C_1$. The boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$ are automatically satisfied by the sine functions.\n\nIn conclusion, the solution $u(x,t)$ can be written as a Fourier series with coefficients $A_n$ and constant $C_1$ determined by the initial condition. The exact form of the solution is difficult to find due to the nonlinear term in the equation, but it can be approximated using perturbation methods or numerical methods."
