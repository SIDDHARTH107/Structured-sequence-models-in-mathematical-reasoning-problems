    "message_1": "If a standard deck of 52 cards contains 4 Aces (one each of Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades), what is the probability of drawing an Ace when one card is drawn randomly from the deck?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of drawing an Ace from a standard deck of 52 cards, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nThere are 4 Aces in the deck (favorable outcomes) and 52 cards in total (possible outcomes).\n\nProbability = 4/52\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n\nProbability = (4/4) / (52/4) = 1/13\n\nSo, the probability of drawing an Ace when one card is drawn randomly from a standard deck of 52 cards is 1/13 or approximately 0.0769 (rounded to four decimal places)."
