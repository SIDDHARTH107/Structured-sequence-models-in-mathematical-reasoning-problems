    "message_2": "To find the angle between the two ships, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. Let's represent the velocity of the first ship as vector A and the velocity of the second ship as vector B.\n\nVector A = 15 km/h at 40 degrees North of East\nVector B = 20 km/h at 60 degrees North of East\n\nWe can break down these vectors into their components:\n\nA_x = 15 * cos(40°)\nA_y = 15 * sin(40°)\n\nB_x = 20 * cos(60°)\nB_y = 20 * sin(60°)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of these two vectors:\n\nA · B = A_x * B_x + A_y * B_y\n\nA · B = (15 * cos(40°)) * (20 * cos(60°)) + (15 * sin(40°)) * (20 * sin(60°))\n\nNow, we can find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|A| = √(A_x^2 + A_y^2) = √((15 * cos(40°))^2 + (15 * sin(40°))^2)\n\n|B| = √(B_x^2 + B_y^2) = √((20 * cos(60°))^2 + (20 * sin(60°))^2)\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the angle θ between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| * |B|)\n\nθ = arccos((A · B) / (|A| * |B|))\n\nθ = arccos(((15 * cos(40°)) * (20 * cos(60°)) + (15 * sin(40°)) * (20 * sin(60°))) / (√((15 * cos(40°))^2 + (15 * sin(40°))^2) * √((20 * cos(60°))^2 + (20 * sin(60°))^2)))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(((15 * cos(40°)) * (20 * cos(60°)) + (15 * sin(40°)) * (20 * sin(60°))) / (√((15 * cos(40°))^2 + (15 * sin(40°))^2) * √((20 * cos(60°))^2 + (20 * sin(60°))^2)))\n\nθ ≈ 20.56°\n\nSo, the angle between the two ships is approximately 20.56 degrees."
