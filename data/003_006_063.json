    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side using the Law of Sines, we first need to find the angle opposite to the third side. Let's call the triangle ABC, where A is the angle between sides of length 8 and 13, B is the angle opposite to the side of length 8, and C is the angle opposite to the side of length 13.\n\nWe are given that angle A is 45 degrees, and side lengths a = 8 and b = 13. We need to find angle C and the length of side c.\n\nStep 1: Find angle C using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\nAngle C = 180 - (Angle A + Angle B)\n\nSince we don't know angle B yet, we can't directly find angle C. However, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side c and then use the Law of Sines to find angle B.\n\nStep 2: Use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side c.\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(A)\nc² = 8² + 13² - 2 * 8 * 13 * cos(45°)\nc² = 64 + 169 - 208 * (1/√2)\nc² = 233 - 208 * (1/√2)\nc² ≈ 233 - 147.08\nc² ≈ 85.92\nc ≈ √85.92\nc ≈ 9.27\n\nStep 3: Use the Law of Sines to find angle B.\n(sin B) / a = (sin A) / b\n(sin B) / 8 = (sin 45°) / 13\nsin B ≈ (8/13) * (1/√2)\nsin B ≈ 0.4423\nB ≈ arcsin(0.4423)\nB ≈ 26.57°\n\nStep 4: Find angle C using the sum of angles in a triangle.\nC = 180 - (A + B)\nC = 180 - (45 + 26.57)\nC ≈ 180 - 71.57\nC ≈ 108.43°\n\nNow we have all the angles and side lengths of the triangle. The length of the third side (c) is approximately 9.27 units."
