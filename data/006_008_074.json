    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 5 (days)\n- k = 2 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.3 (probability of rain on any given day)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(5, 2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 rainy days out of 5 days:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!)\n         = 5! / (2! * 3!)\n         = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n         = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)\n         = 10\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * 0.3^2 * (1 - 0.3)^(5-2)\n         = 10 * 0.3^2 * 0.7^3\n         = 10 * 0.09 * 0.343\n         = 10 * 0.03087\n         = 0.3087\n\nSo, the probability of it raining on exactly 2 out of the next 5 days is approximately 0.3087 or 30.87%."
