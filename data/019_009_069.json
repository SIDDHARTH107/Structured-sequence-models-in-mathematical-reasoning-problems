    "message_2": "Yes, the proposition P: \"There exists a natural number n such that n + 1 = 4\" is provable in intuitionistic logic.\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a constructive approach to logic, which means that to prove the existence of an object, we must provide a construction or an example of that object. In this case, we need to find a natural number n such that n + 1 = 4.\n\nWe can easily find such a number: n = 3, since 3 + 1 = 4. Since we have provided a specific example of a natural number that satisfies the proposition, the proposition P is provable in intuitionistic logic."
