    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using complex analysis, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Then, the given partial differential equation becomes:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nDivide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $x$ and the right-hand side is a function of $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's denote this constant as $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2, \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0, \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nSolve the first equation for $X(x)$:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(0, y) = u(1, y) = 0$:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$\n\n$X(1) = A\\cos(\\lambda) + B\\sin(\\lambda) = B\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$\n\nSince $B$ cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we have:\n\n$\\sin(\\lambda) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\lambda = n\\pi, \\;\\;\\; n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nNow, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nSolve the second equation for $Y(y)$:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\lambda y) + D\\sinh(\\lambda y)$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(x, 0) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi x)}{\\sinh(\\pi)}$ and $u(x, 1) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi (1-x))}{\\sinh(\\pi)}$:\n\n$Y(0) = C\\cosh(0) + D\\sinh(0) = C = \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi x)}{\\sinh(\\pi)}$\n\n$Y(1) = C\\cosh(\\lambda) + D\\sinh(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi (1-x))}{\\sinh(\\pi)}$\n\nSince $C = \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi x)}{\\sinh(\\pi)}$, we have:\n\n$Y_n(y) = \\frac{\\sinh(n\\pi x)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}\\cosh(n\\pi y) + D_n\\sinh(n\\pi y)$\n\nNow, the general solution is given by:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x)Y_n(y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\left(\\frac{\\sinh(n\\pi x)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}\\cosh(n\\pi y) + D_n\\sinh(n\\pi y)\\right)$\n\nTo satisfy the boundary conditions, we need to find the coefficients $B_n$ and $D_n$. Since the boundary conditions are already satisfied for $u(x, 0)$ and $u(x, 1)$, we only need to find $D_n$ such that the boundary conditions $u(0, y) = u(1, y) = 0$ are satisfied. \n\nNotice that the first term in the parentheses is already zero at $x=0$ and $x=1$, so we only need to find $D_n$ such that the second term is zero at these points:\n\n$D_n\\sinh(n\\pi y) = 0 \\Rightarrow D_n = 0$\n\nThus, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\frac{\\sinh(n\\pi x)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}\\cosh(n\\pi y)$\n\nSince the boundary conditions are already satisfied, we don't need to find the coefficients $B_n$. The solution is given by the above series."
