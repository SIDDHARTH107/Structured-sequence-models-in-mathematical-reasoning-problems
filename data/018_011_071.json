    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of sets A and B, which is denoted as A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\nSince there are no common elements in sets A and B, the intersection is an empty set:\nA ∩ B = ∅\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) × B and A × B.\n\n1. (A ∩ B) × B:\nSince A ∩ B = ∅, the Cartesian product of an empty set with any set is also an empty set:\n(A ∩ B) × B = ∅ × B = ∅\n\n2. A × B:\nThe Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B}\n\nSo, A × B = {(0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, we need to show that the Cartesian product is distributive over intersection. The distributive property states that for any sets A, B, and C:\n\n(A ∩ B) × C = (A × C) ∩ (B × C)\n\nIn our case, we have A, B, and C as A, B, and B respectively. So, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∩ B) × B = (A × B) ∩ (B × B)\n\nWe already found (A ∩ B) × B = ∅ and A × B = {(0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)}. Now let's find B × B:\n\nB × B = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A × B) and (B × B):\n\n(A × B) ∩ (B × B) = {(0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)} ∩ {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nThere are no common elements in these two sets, so their intersection is an empty set:\n\n(A × B) ∩ (B × B) = ∅\n\nNow, let's compare the results:\n\n(A ∩ B) × B = ∅\n(A × B) ∩ (B × B) = ∅\n\nSince both results are equal, we have shown that the Cartesian product is distributive over intersection for the given sets A and B."
