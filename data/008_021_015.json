    "message_2": "Since the matrix associated with this system of linear equations is singular, it means that the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. Let's try to solve the system using the method of substitution or elimination.\n\nFirst, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the y and z variables:\n\n(2x + y + z) - (x + y + z) = 9 - 6\nx = 3\n\nNow, substitute the value of x into the first equation:\n\n3 + y + z = 6\n\nWe get:\n\ny + z = 3 (1)\n\nNow, substitute the value of x into the third equation:\n\n3(3) + 4y + 2z = 17\n9 + 4y + 2z = 17\n\nWe get:\n\n4y + 2z = 8 (2)\n\nNow, divide equation (2) by 2:\n\n2y + z = 4 (3)\n\nNow, subtract equation (1) from equation (3) to eliminate the z variable:\n\n(2y + z) - (y + z) = 4 - 3\ny = 1\n\nNow, substitute the value of y into equation (1):\n\n1 + z = 3\n\nWe get:\n\nz = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 1, and z = 2."
