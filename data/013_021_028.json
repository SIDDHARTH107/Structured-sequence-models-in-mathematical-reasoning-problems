    "message_1": "In a two-player centipede game, each player is given a dollar in the first round. In each subsequent round, the players simultaneously decide whether to end the game and split the current sum evenly, or to continue. If they both decide to continue, the current sum doubles and both players receive nothing. What is the optimal strategy for both players if the game is to be played for 3 rounds?",
    "message_2": "In a centipede game, the optimal strategy is to use backward induction. We will start by analyzing the last round and work our way back to the first round.\n\nRound 3:\nIn the third round, the sum is $4. If both players decide to continue, the game ends, and they both receive nothing. If either player decides to end the game, they will split the $4 evenly, receiving $2 each. Since receiving $2 is better than receiving nothing, both players should choose to end the game in the third round.\n\nRound 2:\nIn the second round, the sum is $2. If both players decide to continue, they move to the third round, where they have already determined that they should end the game and receive $2 each. If either player decides to end the game in the second round, they will split the $2 evenly, receiving $1 each. Since receiving $2 in the third round is better than receiving $1 in the second round, both players should choose to continue in the second round.\n\nRound 1:\nIn the first round, the sum is $1. If both players decide to continue, they move to the second round, where they have already determined that they should continue to the third round and receive $2 each. If either player decides to end the game in the first round, they will split the $1 evenly, receiving $0.50 each. Since receiving $2 in the third round is better than receiving $0.50 in the first round, both players should choose to continue in the first round.\n\nOptimal Strategy:\nThe optimal strategy for both players in a 3-round centipede game is to continue in the first and second rounds and end the game in the third round, resulting in both players receiving $2 each."
