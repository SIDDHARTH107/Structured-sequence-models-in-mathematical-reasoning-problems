    "message_2": "To find the expected change in the stock price per share, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding change in the stock price and then add up the results.\n\nExpected change = (Probability of increase by $5) * ($5) + (Probability of increase by $3) * ($3) + (Probability of decrease by $4) * (-$4)\n\nExpected change = (0.20 * $5) + (0.35 * $3) + (0.45 * -$4)\n\nExpected change = ($1) + ($1.05) + (-$1.80)\n\nExpected change = $1 + $1.05 - $1.80\n\nExpected change = $0.25\n\nSo, the expected change in the stock price per share is $0.25."
