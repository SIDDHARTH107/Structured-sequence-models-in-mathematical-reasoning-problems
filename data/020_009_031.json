    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products - Product A and Product B. The production cost for A is $3 and for B is $5. The company has a limited budget of $400 for production today. They estimate that they can sell at most 100 units of A and 80 units of B today. Product A sells for $10 and Product B sells for $12 at the current market conditions. The company wants to maximize its profit by the end of the day. What is the optimal production quantity for each product?",
