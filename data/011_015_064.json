    "message_1": "An art museum has an exhibition space with 6 rooms. Each room is painted with one of two colors: red or blue. What is the minimum number of visitors needed to guarantee that either 3 rooms are all red or 3 rooms are all blue?",
    "message_2": "To guarantee that either 3 rooms are all red or 3 rooms are all blue, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. In the worst-case scenario, a visitor would visit 2 red rooms and 2 blue rooms. If a 5th visitor comes, they must visit either a red or blue room, which would then create a group of 3 rooms of the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of visitors needed is 5."
