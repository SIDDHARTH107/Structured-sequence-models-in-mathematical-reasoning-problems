    "message_1": "Suppose that the weights of apples in a certain orchard follow a normal distribution with a mean of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 10 grams. What proportion of apples in the orchard weighs less than 135 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the proportion of apples that weigh less than 135 grams, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the proportion.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize (135 grams in this case), μ is the mean (150 grams), and σ is the standard deviation (10 grams).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (135 - 150) / 10\nz = -15 / 10\nz = -1.5\n\nNow, we look up the z-score of -1.5 in the standard normal distribution table. The table gives us the proportion of values to the left of the z-score (i.e., the proportion of apples weighing less than 135 grams).\n\nLooking up -1.5 in the z-table, we find a proportion of approximately 0.0668.\n\nSo, about 6.68% of apples in the orchard weigh less than 135 grams."
