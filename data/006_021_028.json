    "message_2": "To find the probability of no hailstorm in May for the next 5 consecutive years, we need to find the probability of no hailstorm in a single year and then raise it to the power of 5 (since the events are independent).\n\nThe probability of no hailstorm in a single year is 1 minus the probability of a hailstorm occurring. So, the probability of no hailstorm in a single year is:\n\n1 - 0.20 = 0.80\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of no hailstorm for the next 5 consecutive years. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities:\n\n(0.80)^5 = 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80 â‰ˆ 0.32768\n\nSo, the probability of no hailstorm in May for the next 5 consecutive years is approximately 0.32768 or 32.77%."
