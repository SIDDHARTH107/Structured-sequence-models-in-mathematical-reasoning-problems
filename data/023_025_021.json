    "message_1": "One possible question for a math student to solve related to using the Fourier transform to solve problems in materials science is:\n\nWhat is the 2D Fourier transform of a rectangular function of height 1 and width 2 centered at the origin, i.e., f(x,y) = rect(x/2)rect(y/2)? \n\nPlease note that rect(x) is the rectangular function, which is defined as 1 for |x| < 1/2 and 0 otherwise. The Fourier transform of f(x,y) is given by F(u,v) = ∫∫ f(x,y) exp(-i 2π (ux+vy)) dx dy.",
    "message_2": "To find the 2D Fourier transform of the given rectangular function f(x,y) = rect(x/2)rect(y/2), we need to compute the double integral F(u,v) = ∫∫ f(x,y) exp(-i 2π (ux+vy)) dx dy.\n\nFirst, let's consider the limits of integration for x and y. Since the rectangular function is non-zero only for |x| < 1 and |y| < 1/2, the limits of integration will be -1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and -1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1/2.\n\nNow, we can compute the Fourier transform:\n\nF(u,v) = ∫∫ f(x,y) exp(-i 2π (ux+vy)) dx dy\n       = ∫(from -1 to 1) ∫(from -1/2 to 1/2) rect(x/2)rect(y/2) exp(-i 2π (ux+vy)) dy dx\n\nSince rect(x/2)rect(y/2) = 1 for -1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and -1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1/2, we can simplify the integral as:\n\nF(u,v) = ∫(from -1 to 1) ∫(from -1/2 to 1/2) exp(-i 2π (ux+vy)) dy dx\n\nNow, we can separate the integrals for x and y:\n\nF(u,v) = [∫(from -1 to 1) exp(-i 2π ux) dx] [∫(from -1/2 to 1/2) exp(-i 2π vy) dy]\n\nLet's compute the two integrals separately:\n\nIntegral_x = ∫(from -1 to 1) exp(-i 2π ux) dx = (1/(i 2π u)) [exp(-i 2π u) - exp(i 2π u)] = (1/πu) sin(2πu)\n\nIntegral_y = ∫(from -1/2 to 1/2) exp(-i 2π vy) dy = (1/(i 2π v)) [exp(-i π v) - exp(i π v)] = (1/πv) sin(πv)\n\nNow, multiply the two integrals to get the 2D Fourier transform:\n\nF(u,v) = (1/πu) sin(2πu) * (1/πv) sin(πv)\n\nSo, the 2D Fourier transform of the given rectangular function is:\n\nF(u,v) = (1/(π^2 uv)) sin(2πu) sin(πv)"
