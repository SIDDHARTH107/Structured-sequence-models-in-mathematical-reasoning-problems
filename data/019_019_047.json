    "message_1": "Consider a Turing machine M that takes an input of a binary string and outputs the reverse of that string. Assume that the tape symbol set for M is {0, 1, B} where B is the blank symbol. If M starts with the tape head positioned over the leftmost symbol of an input string x, what is the minimum number of steps that M must take to halt and output the reversed string of x?",
    "message_2": "Let n be the length of the input string x. The Turing machine M must perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Read the input string x from left to right.\n2. Write the reversed string on the tape.\n3. Move the tape head back to the leftmost symbol of the reversed string.\n4. Halt.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the minimum number of steps required for each task:\n\n1. Read the input string x from left to right:\n   - M needs n steps to read the entire input string x.\n\n2. Write the reversed string on the tape:\n   - M needs n steps to write the reversed string on the tape.\n\n3. Move the tape head back to the leftmost symbol of the reversed string:\n   - M needs n steps to move the tape head back to the leftmost symbol of the reversed string.\n\n4. Halt:\n   - M needs 1 step to halt.\n\nSo, the minimum number of steps that M must take to halt and output the reversed string of x is:\n\nn (read input) + n (write reversed string) + n (move tape head) + 1 (halt) = 3n + 1 steps."
