Provide a detailed explanation of the similarities and differences, with examples of each group's elements and operations.",
    "message_2": "A non-abelian group of order 36 can have several structures, but one example is the semi-direct product of two cyclic groups, C9 and C4, denoted as C9 ⋊ C4. This group is non-abelian, meaning that the group operation is not commutative, i.e., the order of elements matters when performing the group operation.\n\nNow let's compare this non-abelian group with the cyclic group C36 and the alternating group A4 × C3.\n\n1. Cyclic group C36:\nC36 is an abelian group of order 36, generated by a single element, say g, such that g^36 = e (identity element). The elements of C36 are {e, g, g^2, ..., g^35}. The group operation is simply the addition of exponents modulo 36. Since it is a cyclic group, it is abelian, meaning that the group operation is commutative.\n\n2. Alternating group A4 × C3:\nThis group is a direct product of the alternating group A4 (even permutations of 4 elements) and the cyclic group C3. A4 has 12 elements, and C3 has 3 elements. The elements of A4 × C3 are ordered pairs (a, b), where a is an element of A4 and b is an element of C3. The group operation is performed component-wise: (a1, b1) * (a2, b2) = (a1 * a2, b1 * b2). A4 × C3 is also a non-abelian group, as A4 is non-abelian.\n\nComparison:\n\n1. Abelian vs. Non-abelian:\nC36 is abelian, while C9 ⋊ C4 and A4 × C3 are non-abelian. This means that the group operation is commutative in C36, but not in C9 ⋊ C4 and A4 × C3.\n\n2. Group elements:\nC36 has elements that are powers of a single generator, while C9 ⋊ C4 and A4 × C3 have more complex structures. In C9 ⋊ C4, elements can be represented as pairs (a, b), where a is an element of C9 and b is an element of C4, but the group operation is not performed component-wise like in A4 × C3. Instead, it involves a semi-direct product, which depends on a homomorphism between C4 and the automorphism group of C9. In A4 × C3, elements are ordered pairs of elements from A4 and C3, and the group operation is performed component-wise.\n\n3. Generators:\nC36 has a single generator, while C9 ⋊ C4 and A4 × C3 have multiple generators. In C9 ⋊ C4, the generators are elements from C9 and C4, and in A4 × C3, the generators are elements from A4 and C3.\n\nIn conclusion, the non-abelian group C9 ⋊ C4 has a more complex structure compared to the cyclic group C36, and its group operation is not commutative. The alternating group A4 × C3 is also non-abelian and has a different structure, with its elements being ordered pairs of elements from A4 and C3, and the group operation being performed component-wise."
