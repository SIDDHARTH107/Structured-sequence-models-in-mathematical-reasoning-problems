    "message_2": "Yes, these two graphs are isomorphic. Isomorphic graphs have the same structure, meaning they have the same number of vertices and edges, and the connections between vertices are preserved. In this case, both graphs have 4 vertices and 4 edges, and the connections between vertices are the same.\n\nTo show this, we can provide a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the two graphs that preserves the adjacency of vertices:\n\nA -> 1\nB -> 2\nC -> 3\nD -> 4\n\nThe labelled diagram for Graph 1 and Graph 2 with the correspondence is as follows:\n\nGraph 1:\n\n```\nA(1)---B(2)\n |     |\nC(3)---D(4)\n```\n\nGraph 2:\n\n```\n1(A)---2(B)\n |     |\n3(C)---4(D)\n```\n\nAs we can see, the structure of both graphs is the same, and the connections between vertices are preserved. Therefore, the two graphs are isomorphic."
