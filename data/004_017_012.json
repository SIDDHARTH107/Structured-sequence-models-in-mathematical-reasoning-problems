    "message_1": "A curve has the equation y = x^(3/2) from x=0 to x=4. Find the arc length of the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x^(3/2):\n\nf'(x) = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + (9/4)x, then du = (9/4)dx. We also need to change the limits of integration:\n\nWhen x = 0, u = 1 + (9/4)(0) = 1\nWhen x = 4, u = 1 + (9/4)(4) = 1 + 9 = 10\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 10] √(u) * (4/9) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 10]\n\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (8/27) * (10√10 - 1)\n\nL ≈ 20.21\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve is approximately 20.21 units."
