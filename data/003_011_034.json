    "message_1": "A flagpole that is 25 feet tall casts a shadow that is 40 feet long. What is the distance between the top of the flagpole and the tip of the shadow? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a foot.",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the height of the flagpole as 'a' (25 feet), the length of the shadow as 'b' (40 feet), and the distance between the top of the flagpole and the tip of the shadow as 'c' (the hypotenuse).\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc^2 = (25)^2 + (40)^2\nc^2 = 625 + 1600\nc^2 = 2225\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the value of 'c':\n\nc = √2225\nc ≈ 47.2\n\nSo, the distance between the top of the flagpole and the tip of the shadow is approximately 47.2 feet, rounded to the nearest tenth of a foot."
