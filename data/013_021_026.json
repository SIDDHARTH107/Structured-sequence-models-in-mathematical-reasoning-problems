    "message_1": "Two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a centipede game. Both players start with a prize of $20. In each round, Alice (Player 1) has the option to either pass or take the prize. If Alice decides to pass, Bob (Player 2) has the option to pass or take the prize. If both players pass, the prize increases by $10 and they go to the next round. If either player takes the prize, the game ends and that player keeps the prize. How much money will Alice receive if the game ends after the 5th round and Alice takes the prize in round 3?",
    "message_2": "If Alice takes the prize in round 3, the game will not continue until the 5th round. Let's calculate the prize amount when Alice takes it in round 3.\n\nRound 1: Both players pass, prize increases to $20 + $10 = $30.\nRound 2: Both players pass, prize increases to $30 + $10 = $40.\nRound 3: Alice takes the prize, game ends.\n\nAlice will receive $40."
