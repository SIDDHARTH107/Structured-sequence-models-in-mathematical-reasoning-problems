    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation, and multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the third equation.\n\n2*(x + y + z) = 2*5\n2x + 2y + 2z = 10\n\nNow subtract the first equation multiplied by 2 from the second equation:\n\n(2x + 3y + 4z) - (2x + 2y + 2z) = 10 - 10\ny + 2z = 0  (1)\n\n3*(x + y + z) = 3*5\n3x + 3y + 3z = 15\n\nNow subtract the first equation multiplied by 3 from the third equation:\n\n(3x + 4y + 5z) - (3x + 3y + 3z) = 15 - 15\ny + 2z = 0  (2)\n\nNow we have two identical equations (1) and (2). This means that the system of equations is dependent, and there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express y in terms of z:\n\ny = -2z\n\nNow substitute this expression for y back into the first equation:\n\nx - 2z + z = 5\nx - z = 5\n\nNow we can express x in terms of z:\n\nx = z + 5\n\nThe general solution for this system of linear equations is:\n\nx = z + 5\ny = -2z\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
