    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to complete a project that will yield a profit of $200. The agent may choose to exert high or low effort, but the principal does not observe the effort chosen. If the agent exerts high effort, the probability of completing the project successfully is 0.9. If the agent exerts low effort, the probability of completing the project successfully is 0.4. If the agent exerts high effort, she incurs a cost of $60. If the agent exerts low effort, she incurs a cost of $20. Determine the agent's optimal effort and the resulting profits for both the principal and agent.",
    "message_2": "To determine the agent's optimal effort, we need to compare the expected profits for both the agent and the principal under high and low effort scenarios.\n\n1. High effort scenario:\nProbability of success: 0.9\nAgent's cost: $60\nPrincipal's profit if successful: $200\n\nAgent's expected profit: 0.9 * (200 - 60) = 0.9 * 140 = $126\nPrincipal's expected profit: 0.9 * 200 = $180\n\n2. Low effort scenario:\nProbability of success: 0.4\nAgent's cost: $20\nPrincipal's profit if successful: $200\n\nAgent's expected profit: 0.4 * (200 - 20) = 0.4 * 180 = $72\nPrincipal's expected profit: 0.4 * 200 = $80\n\nComparing the expected profits for the agent and principal under both scenarios, we can see that the agent's optimal effort is to exert high effort, as it results in higher expected profits for both the agent ($126 vs $72) and the principal ($180 vs $80).\n\nThus, the agent should exert high effort, and the resulting expected profits are $126 for the agent and $180 for the principal."
