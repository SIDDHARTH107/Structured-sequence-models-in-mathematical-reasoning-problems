    "message_1": "A factory manufactures toys and packages them in boxes of 6, 12, or 24 toys. If the factory produces 240 toys, how many different combinations of boxes can they make? Assume that the number of boxes of each size is unlimited.",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z represent the number of boxes of 6, 12, and 24 toys, respectively. We want to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\n6x + 12y + 24z = 240\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 6:\n\nx + 2y + 4z = 40\n\nNow, we will find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation. We can do this by iterating through all possible values of x, y, and z and checking if they satisfy the equation.\n\nWe know that x can range from 0 to 40, since 40 is the maximum number of 6-toy boxes that can be made. For each value of x, we can find the possible values of y and z.\n\nHere are the combinations that satisfy the equation:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 0, z = 10\n2. x = 0, y = 2, z = 9\n3. x = 0, y = 4, z = 8\n4. x = 0, y = 6, z = 7\n5. x = 0, y = 8, z = 6\n6. x = 0, y = 10, z = 5\n7. x = 0, y = 12, z = 4\n8. x = 0, y = 14, z = 3\n9. x = 0, y = 16, z = 2\n10. x = 0, y = 18, z = 1\n11. x = 0, y = 20, z = 0\n12. x = 2, y = 1, z = 9\n13. x = 2, y = 3, z = 8\n14. x = 2, y = 5, z = 7\n15. x = 2, y = 7, z = 6\n16. x = 2, y = 9, z = 5\n17. x = 2, y = 11, z = 4\n18. x = 2, y = 13, z = 3\n19. x = 2, y = 15, z = 2\n20. x = 2, y = 17, z = 1\n21. x = 2, y = 19, z = 0\n22. x = 4, y = 0, z = 8\n23. x = 4, y = 2, z = 7\n24. x = 4, y = 4, z = 6\n25. x = 4, y = 6, z = 5\n26. x = 4, y = 8, z = 4\n27. x = 4, y = 10, z = 3\n28. x = 4, y = 12, z = 2\n29. x = 4, y = 14, z = 1\n30. x = 4, y = 16, z = 0\n31. x = 6, y = 1, z = 6\n32. x = 6, y = 3, z = 5\n33. x = 6, y = 5, z = 4\n34. x = 6, y = 7, z = 3\n35. x = 6, y = 9, z = 2\n36. x = 6, y = 11, z = 1\n37. x = 6, y = 13, z = 0\n38. x = 8, y = 0, z = 5\n39. x = 8, y = 2, z = 4\n40. x = 8, y = 4, z = 3\n41. x = 8, y = 6, z = 2\n42. x = 8, y = 8, z = 1\n43. x = 8, y = 10, z = 0\n44. x = 10, y = 1, z = 4\n45. x = 10, y = 3, z = 3\n46. x = 10, y = 5, z = 2\n47. x = 10, y = 7, z = 1\n48. x = 10, y = 9, z = 0\n49. x = 12, y = 0, z = 3\n50. x = 12, y = 2, z = 2\n51. x = 12, y = 4, z = 1\n52. x = 12, y = 6, z = 0\n53. x = 14, y = 1, z = 2\n54. x = 14, y = 3, z = 1\n55. x = 14, y = 5, z = 0\n56. x = 16, y = 0, z = 1\n57. x = 16, y = 2, z = 0\n58. x = 18, y = 1, z = 0\n59. x = 20, y = 0, z = 0\n\nThere are 59 different combinations of boxes that can be made."
