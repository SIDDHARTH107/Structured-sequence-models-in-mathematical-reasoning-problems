    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of the curves $C$ and $D$, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0 \\quad (2)$$\n\nFirst, we can rewrite equation $(2)$ as:\n\n$$x^2 = -(y^2 + z^2) \\quad (3)$$\n\nNow, substitute equation $(3)$ into equation $(1)$:\n\n$$(-y^2 - z^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} + y^3 + z^3 = 0$$\n\nLet's consider the cases when one of the variables is equal to zero:\n\n1. If $x = 0$, then from equation $(2)$, we have $y^2 + z^2 = 0$. Since $y^2$ and $z^2$ are both non-negative, the only solution is $y = z = 0$. However, this solution corresponds to the point $(0:0:0)$, which is not in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. Therefore, there are no intersection points with $x = 0$.\n\n2. If $y = 0$, then from equation $(1)$, we have $x^3 + z^3 = 0$, which implies $x^3 = -z^3$. Since $x$ and $z$ are homogeneous coordinates, we can assume that $x = z^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $z = x^3$. Substituting this into equation $(2)$, we get $x^2 + x^6 = 0$, which has two solutions: $x = 0$ (which we already ruled out) and $x^4 = -1$. The latter solution corresponds to the intersection point $(1:i:1)$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\n3. If $z = 0$, the analysis is symmetric to the case when $y = 0$, and we obtain another intersection point $(1:1:i)$.\n\nNow, let's assume that all variables are non-zero. We can divide equation $(1)$ by $x^3$:\n\n$$1 + \\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^3 + \\left(\\frac{z}{x}\\right)^3 = 0$$\n\nLet $u = \\frac{y}{x}$ and $v = \\frac{z}{x}$. Then, we have:\n\n$$1 + u^3 + v^3 = 0 \\quad (4)$$\n\nFrom equation $(3)$, we have:\n\n$$1 = -\\left(\\frac{y^2}{x^2} + \\frac{z^2}{x^2}\\right) = -(u^2 + v^2)$$\n\nThus, $u^2 + v^2 = -1$. Since $u^2$ and $v^2$ are both non-negative, there are no real solutions for $u$ and $v$. Therefore, there are no additional intersection points in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two intersection points between the curves $C$ and $D$: $(1:i:1)$ and $(1:1:i)$."
