    "message_2": "To find the Julia set for the function f(z) = z² + c, where c = -0.1 + 0.8i, we need to iterate the function for each point z in the complex plane and determine if the sequence of iterations remains bounded or escapes to infinity. If the sequence remains bounded, the point z is in the Julia set.\n\nThe Julia set is a fractal, and its boundary is the set of points where the sequence neither converges nor diverges to infinity. To find the Julia set, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Choose a resolution for the complex plane, e.g., a grid of points with a certain step size.\n2. For each point z in the grid, iterate the function f(z) = z² + c a certain number of times (e.g., 1000 iterations).\n3. If the magnitude of the resulting value is less than a certain threshold (e.g., 2), the point z is considered to be in the Julia set.\n\nTo find the corresponding region on the Mandelbrot set, we need to check if the parameter c is in the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of all complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z² + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0.\n\nTo check if c is in the Mandelbrot set, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Set z = 0 and iterate the function f(z) = z² + c a certain number of times (e.g., 1000 iterations).\n2. If the magnitude of the resulting value is less than a certain threshold (e.g., 2), the parameter c is considered to be in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nIn this case, c = -0.1 + 0.8i. After iterating the function f(z) = z² + c from z = 0, we find that the magnitude of the resulting value is greater than 2, so c is not in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nIn summary, the Julia set for the function f(z) = z² + c, where c = -0.1 + 0.8i, can be found by iterating the function for each point z in the complex plane and checking if the sequence remains bounded. The corresponding region on the Mandelbrot set is empty since c is not in the Mandelbrot set."
