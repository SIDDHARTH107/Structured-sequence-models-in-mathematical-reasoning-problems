    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the area under the curve y = x^2 between the limits x = 0 and x = 3 about the y-axis, we will use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of infinitesimally thin disks along the axis of rotation.\n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y, since we are rotating about the y-axis. From the equation y = x^2, we have x = sqrt(y).\n\nThe volume of a single disk is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height (thickness) of the disk. In this case, the radius is x (which we will express in terms of y), and the height is dy (an infinitesimally small change in y).\n\nSo, the volume of a single disk is V = π(sqrt(y))^2 dy = πy dy.\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression with respect to y, over the range of y values that correspond to the given x limits (0 to 3). Since y = x^2, when x = 0, y = 0, and when x = 3, y = 3^2 = 9.\n\nSo, the total volume is given by the integral:\n\nV = ∫[πy dy] from y = 0 to y = 9.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nV = π ∫[y dy] from y = 0 to y = 9\nV = π [y^2/2] from y = 0 to y = 9\nV = π [(9^2/2) - (0^2/2)]\nV = π (81/2)\nV = (81π)/2\n\nSo, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the area under the curve y = x^2 between the limits x = 0 and x = 3 about the y-axis is (81π)/2 cubic units."
