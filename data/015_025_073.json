    "message_1": "Let's assume that the forced van der Pol oscillator is given by the following equation:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} - \\mu (1 - x^2) \\dot{x} + x = A \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $\\mu > 0$, $A > 0$ and $\\omega > 0$ are constants. \n\nSuppose we have an oscillator with $\\mu = 1.5$, $A = 0.5$, $\\omega = 0.8$, and initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$. \n\nFind the maximum value of $x(t)$ over the time interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 100$.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of $x(t)$ over the given time interval, we need to solve the given second-order nonlinear differential equation numerically. We can use a numerical method such as the Runge-Kutta method to solve the equation. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given second-order equation as a system of two first-order equations:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = y$$\n$$\\dot{y} = \\mu (1 - x^2) y - x + A \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\nNow, let's use the given values for $\\mu$, $A$, and $\\omega$:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = y$$\n$$\\dot{y} = 1.5 (1 - x^2) y - x + 0.5 \\sin(0.8 t)$$\n\nWith the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = y(0) = 0$, we can use a numerical method to solve this system of equations over the time interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 100$.\n\nAfter solving the system of equations numerically, we can find the maximum value of $x(t)$ over the given time interval. Note that the actual maximum value will depend on the specific numerical method used and the step size chosen for the method.\n\nIt is important to mention that the maximum value of $x(t)$ cannot be determined analytically in this case due to the complexity of the forced van der Pol oscillator equation."
