    "message_2": "To maximize the expected profit, we need to calculate the expected profit for each scenario and then determine the premium that would maximize it.\n\n1. Insurance pays:\n- If the customer doesn't file a claim, the insurance company makes a profit of $1000 (premium - $0 cost).\n- If the customer files a claim, the insurance company makes a profit of -$500 (premium - $500 cost - $500 payout).\n\n2. Insurance denies:\n- If the customer doesn't file a claim, the insurance company makes a profit of $0 (premium - $0 cost).\n- If the customer files a claim, the insurance company makes a profit of $0 (premium - $0 cost).\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for each scenario:\n\n1. Insurance pays:\n- Expected profit = (probability of not filing a claim * profit when not filing a claim) + (probability of filing a claim * profit when filing a claim)\n- Expected profit = (0.7 * $1000) + (0.3 * -$500)\n- Expected profit = $700 - $150\n- Expected profit = $550\n\n2. Insurance denies:\n- Expected profit = (probability of not filing a claim * profit when not filing a claim) + (probability of filing a claim * profit when filing a claim)\n- Expected profit = (0.7 * $0) + (0.3 * $0)\n- Expected profit = $0\n\nSince the insurance company wants to maximize their expected profit, they should choose the scenario with the highest expected profit, which is the \"Insurance pays\" scenario. In this case, the expected profit is $550.\n\nTo determine the premium, we need to consider the costs and payouts involved in this scenario. The insurance company incurs a cost of $500 for handling each filed claim and pays out $500 for each claim. Therefore, the premium should be set at a level that covers these costs and maximizes the expected profit.\n\nPremium = Expected profit + (probability of filing a claim * cost of handling claim + payout)\nPremium = $550 + (0.3 * $1000)\nPremium = $550 + $300\nPremium = $850\n\nSo, the insurance company should charge a premium of $850 to maximize their expected profit."
