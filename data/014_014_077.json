    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH IS FUN\" using the Playfair cipher with the key phrase \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid using the key phrase and the English alphabet (excluding 'J', which is combined with 'I').\n\n   Remove duplicate letters from the key phrase: CRYPTOGRAPYH -> CRYPTOGRAPHY\n   Fill the grid:\n   C R Y P T\n   O G A H B\n   D E F I K\n   L M N S U\n   V W X Z Q\n\n2. Split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\n   MATH IS FUN -> MA TH IS FU NX\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other letter's column.\n\n   MA -> (same row) -> OC\n   TH -> (rectangle) -> YP\n   IS -> (same column) -> KN\n   FU -> (rectangle) -> GT\n   NX -> (rectangle) -> ZD\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message:\n\n   OC YP KN GT ZD\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the Playfair cipher with the key phrase \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" is \"OCYPKNGTZD\"."
