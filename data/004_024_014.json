    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the implicit function x^3 + y^3 = 9xy, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, using the chain rule when necessary.\n\nFirst, differentiate x^3 with respect to x:\nd(x^3)/dx = 3x^2\n\nNext, differentiate y^3 with respect to x. Since y is a function of x, we need to use the chain rule:\nd(y^3)/dx = d(y^3)/dy * dy/dx = 3y^2 * dy/dx\n\nNow, differentiate 9xy with respect to x. We need to use the product rule here:\nd(9xy)/dx = 9x * d(y)/dx + 9y * d(x)/dx = 9x(dy/dx) + 9y\n\nNow that we have the derivatives, we can rewrite the equation:\n3x^2 + 3y^2 * dy/dx = 9x(dy/dx) + 9y\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx. First, isolate the terms containing dy/dx:\n3y^2 * dy/dx - 9x * dy/dx = 9y - 3x^2\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\ndy/dx * (3y^2 - 9x) = 9y - 3x^2\n\nFinally, divide both sides by (3y^2 - 9x) to solve for dy/dx:\ndy/dx = (9y - 3x^2) / (3y^2 - 9x)"
