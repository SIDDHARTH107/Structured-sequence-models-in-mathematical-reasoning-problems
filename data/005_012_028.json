    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate the average age of its employees. They have a total of 500 employees. If they choose a simple random sample of 50 employees, and the mean age of the 50 employees is 35 years with a standard deviation of 5 years, what is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all the employees in the company?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all the employees in the company, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nHere, the Mean is the sample mean, which is 35 years. The Critical Value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (based on the standard normal distribution). The Standard Error is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\nStandard Error = 5 / √50\nStandard Error ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 35 ± (1.96 * 0.7071)\nConfidence Interval = 35 ± 1.3859\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all the employees in the company is approximately 33.61 to 36.39 years."
