    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 farmers who share a common grazing land. Each farmer can graze up to 20 cattle on the land. If each farmer grazes their full capacity, the land can support a maximum of 2000 cattle before it becomes depleted. However, if the total number of cattle exceeds 2000, the land becomes overgrazed, leading to long-term damage. If the value of each cattle is $500, what is the total maximum revenue that can be generated from the land?",
    "message_2": "To find the total maximum revenue that can be generated from the land, we need to multiply the maximum number of cattle the land can support (2000) by the value of each cattle ($500).\n\nTotal maximum revenue = (2000 cattle) * ($500 per cattle) = $1,000,000"
