    "message_2": "There are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. We can prove this using the Sylow Theorems, a subtopic of Group Theory.\n\nLet G be a group of order 32. Since 32 = 2^5, by the Sylow Theorems, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup, say P, of order 2^5. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G, denoted by n_2(G), satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2(G) ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_2(G) divides 32\n\nThe only possibility for n_2(G) is 1, which means that P is a normal subgroup of G. So, G is an extension of P by a group of order 1, which is the trivial group. Therefore, G is a 2-group, and we can classify G by examining its structure as a 2-group.\n\nWe can use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups to classify the abelian 2-groups of order 32. There are 6 such groups:\n\n1. Z_32\n2. Z_16 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_4\n4. Z_8 × Z_2 × Z_2\n5. Z_4 × Z_4 × Z_2\n6. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\n\nNow, we need to consider the non-abelian groups of order 32. We can do this by examining the possible structures of their lower central series, derived series, and maximal abelian subgroups. This process is quite involved and requires a deep understanding of Group Theory. After analyzing these structures, we can determine that there are 45 non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nThus, in total, there are 6 abelian groups and 45 non-abelian groups, making 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
