    "message_2": "To determine the force applied to the car during this acceleration, we need to find the acceleration first and then use Newton's second law of motion (F = ma).\n\n1. Convert the final speed from km/h to m/s:\n60 km/h * (1000 m/km) * (1 h/3600 s) = 16.67 m/s\n\n2. Find the acceleration (a):\nThe formula for acceleration is a = (v_f - v_i) / t, where v_f is the final velocity, v_i is the initial velocity, and t is the time taken.\n\nSince the car starts from rest, the initial velocity (v_i) is 0 m/s. The final velocity (v_f) is 16.67 m/s, and the time taken (t) is 10 seconds.\n\na = (16.67 m/s - 0 m/s) / 10 s = 1.667 m/s²\n\n3. Use Newton's second law of motion to find the force (F):\nF = ma\n\nThe mass (m) of the car is 1200 kg, and the acceleration (a) is 1.667 m/s².\n\nF = (1200 kg)(1.667 m/s²) = 2000.4 N\n\nSo, the force applied to the car during this acceleration is approximately 2000.4 N."
