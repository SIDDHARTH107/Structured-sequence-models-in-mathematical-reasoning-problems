    "message_1": "A digital signature scheme uses RSA with a public key of (e, n) = (7, 77) and a private key of (d, n) = (43, 77). Alice wants to digitally sign a message M = 29. \n\nWhat will be the digital signature S for the message M?",
    "message_2": "To create a digital signature S for the message M, Alice will use her private key (d, n) to sign the message. The signing process involves raising the message M to the power of d modulo n.\n\nS = M^d mod n\n\nIn this case, M = 29, d = 43, and n = 77.\n\nS = 29^43 mod 77\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\nS = 62\n\nSo, the digital signature S for the message M = 29 is 62."
