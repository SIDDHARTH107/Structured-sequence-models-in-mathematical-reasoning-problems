    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 5 players and a total of $100. Each player can choose to either keep their money for themselves or contribute some or all of it to a communal pot, which will be multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and distributed equally among all players. If all players contribute all of their money, they each receive $30. What is the maximum amount of money each player can contribute to the communal pot and still receive a net gain in earnings?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount each player contributes to the communal pot. Since there are 5 players, the total contribution to the pot is 5x. The pot is then multiplied by a factor of 1.5, so the total amount in the pot after multiplication is 1.5(5x) = 7.5x. This amount is distributed equally among the 5 players, so each player receives 7.5x/5 = 1.5x.\n\nFor a player to have a net gain in earnings, the amount they receive from the pot (1.5x) must be greater than the amount they contributed (x). So, we have:\n\n1.5x > x\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n0.5x > 0\n\nDividing by 0.5, we get:\n\nx > 0\n\nThis means that as long as each player contributes more than $0, they will receive a net gain in earnings. However, we also need to consider the constraint that each player initially has $20 (since there are 5 players and a total of $100).\n\nSo, the maximum amount each player can contribute to the communal pot and still receive a net gain in earnings is $20."
