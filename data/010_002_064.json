If the restriction f|A: A → B is a homeomorphism, prove that A is homeomorphic to B. For a specific example, let X = [0, 2] and Y = S^1, the circle centered at the origin in the plane. Let A = {0} ∪ [1, 2] and B = S^1 - {(-1, 0)}. Prove that A and B are homeomorphic.",
    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nLet f: X → Y be a continuous function, and let A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y be subspaces such that the restriction f|A: A → B is a homeomorphism. We want to show that A is homeomorphic to B.\n\nSince f|A: A → B is a homeomorphism, it is continuous and has a continuous inverse, denoted by g: B → A. Now, we need to show that g is also a homeomorphism.\n\nBy definition of a homeomorphism, we need to show that g is continuous and has a continuous inverse. Since g is the inverse of f|A, it is continuous. Moreover, the inverse of g is f|A, which is also continuous. Therefore, g is a homeomorphism.\n\nHence, A is homeomorphic to B.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific example where X = [0, 2], Y = S^1, A = {0} ∪ [1, 2], and B = S^1 - {(-1, 0)}.\n\nDefine the function f: X → Y as follows:\n\nf(x) = (cos(πx), sin(πx))\n\nWe can see that f is continuous. Now, let's consider the restriction of f to A, denoted by f|A: A → B.\n\nf|A(0) = (1, 0), and f|A(x) for x in [1, 2] maps to the points in S^1 - {(-1, 0)}.\n\nNow, we need to show that f|A is a homeomorphism. To do this, we need to find a continuous inverse for f|A.\n\nDefine the function g: B → A as follows:\n\ng(y) = (1/π) * arccos(y_1) for y = (y_1, y_2) in B\n\nWe can see that g is continuous and that g(f|A(x)) = x for all x in A, and f|A(g(y)) = y for all y in B. Thus, g is the continuous inverse of f|A.\n\nTherefore, f|A: A → B is a homeomorphism, and by our previous proof, A is homeomorphic to B."
