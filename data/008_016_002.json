    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative technique used to solve a system of linear equations. The method involves rearranging the equations so that each variable is isolated on the left-hand side, and then iteratively updating the values of the variables until the solution converges within the specified tolerance.\n\nFirst, we rearrange the given system of linear equations to isolate each variable:\n\nx = (4 - y + z) / 3\ny = (10 + x - z) / 4\nz = (-2 - 2x + y) / 5\n\nNow, we will use the Jacobi iterative method with the starting values x=0, y=0, and z=0, and a tolerance of 0.001.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (4 - 0 + 0) / 3 = 1.333\ny1 = (10 + 0 - 0) / 4 = 2.5\nz1 = (-2 - 2*0 + 0) / 5 = -0.4\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (4 - 2.5 + (-0.4)) / 3 = 0.366\ny2 = (10 + 1.333 - (-0.4)) / 4 = 2.933\nz2 = (-2 - 2*1.333 + 2.5) / 5 = 0.133\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (4 - 2.933 + 0.133) / 3 = 0.400\ny3 = (10 + 0.366 - 0.133) / 4 = 2.808\nz3 = (-2 - 2*0.366 + 2.933) / 5 = 0.054\n\nWe continue iterating until the difference between consecutive values of x, y, and z is less than the tolerance of 0.001.\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = (4 - 2.808 + 0.054) / 3 = 0.415\ny4 = (10 + 0.400 - 0.054) / 4 = 2.836\nz4 = (-2 - 2*0.400 + 2.808) / 5 = 0.082\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = (4 - 2.836 + 0.082) / 3 = 0.415\ny5 = (10 + 0.415 - 0.082) / 4 = 2.833\nz5 = (-2 - 2*0.415 + 2.836) / 5 = 0.081\n\nThe difference between consecutive values of x, y, and z is now less than the tolerance of 0.001, so we can stop iterating.\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations using the Jacobi iterative method with a tolerance of 0.001 is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 0.415\ny ≈ 2.833\nz ≈ 0.081"
