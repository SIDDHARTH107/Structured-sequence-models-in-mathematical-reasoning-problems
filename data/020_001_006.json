    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of chairs: wooden and plastic chairs. Each wooden chair requires 3 hours of labor and 2 kilograms of wood, while each plastic chair requires 2 hours of labor and 3 kilograms of plastic. If the company has 120 hours of labor and 180 kilograms of wood and plastic available, and they make a profit of $10 for each wooden chair and $12 for each plastic chair, how many chairs of each type should they produce in order to maximize their profit?",
