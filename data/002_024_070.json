    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply need to add the lengths of all four sides. \n\nPerimeter = length of side 1 + length of side 2 + length of side 3 + length of side 4\n\nThe parallel sides have lengths 8 cm and 12 cm, and the non-parallel sides have lengths 5 cm and 7 cm.\n\nPerimeter = 8 cm + 12 cm + 5 cm + 7 cm\n\nPerimeter = 20 cm + 12 cm\n\nPerimeter = 32 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 32 cm."
