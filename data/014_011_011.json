    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using a transposition cipher with a key of \"3142\", we first arrange the message into groups of 4 letters, and if necessary, we can add extra letters (e.g., X) to complete the last group:\n\nMATHEMATICS -> MATH EMAT ICSX\n\nNow, we apply the key \"3142\" to each group:\n\nMATH -> AMHT\nEMAT -> MEAT\nICSX -> CSIX\n\nFinally, we combine the encrypted groups to get the encrypted message:\n\nAMHTMEATCSIX"
