    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2  3 | 0 ]\n[ 4  5 -6 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -4  6 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2  3 | 0 ]\n[ 0 13 -18 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -4  6 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Subtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2  3 | 0 ]\n[ 0 13 -18 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide the second row by 13:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2  3 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -18/13 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2  3 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -18/13 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 | 0 ]\n```\n\nWe can now use back-substitution to find the solutions:\n\n1. From the second row, we get: y - (18/13)z = 0, or y = (18/13)z.\n\n2. From the first row, we get: x - 2y + 3z = 0. Substituting the expression for y, we get: x - 2(18/13)z + 3z = 0.\n\nSimplifying the equation for x, we get: x = (9/13)z.\n\nSince this is a homogeneous system, the trivial solution (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) is always a solution. However, we also have a non-trivial solution in terms of the parameter z:\n\nx = (9/13)z\ny = (18/13)z\nz = z\n\nThe solution set for this homogeneous system of linear equations is given by:\n\n(x, y, z) = z * (9/13, 18/13, 1), where z is any real number."
