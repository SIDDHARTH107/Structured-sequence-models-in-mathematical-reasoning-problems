    "message_1": "A study of heights of students in a class was carried out with the following results:\n\n5 students have a height of 150cm, \n8 students have a height of 160cm, \n10 students have a height of 170cm, \n7 students have a height of 180cm and \n2 students have a height of 190cm.\n\nUse the IQR method to identify any outliers in the data.",
    "message_2": "To use the IQR method to identify any outliers in the data, we first need to find the quartiles of the data. The data consists of 32 students in total.\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order:\n150, 150, 150, 150, 150, 160, 160, 160, 160, 160, 160, 160, 160, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170, 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, 190, 190\n\n2. Find the median (Q2), which is the middle value of the data:\nSince there are 32 students, the median will be the average of the 16th and 17th values: (170 + 170) / 2 = 170\n\n3. Find the lower quartile (Q1), which is the median of the lower half of the data:\nThe lower half of the data has 16 values, so the lower quartile will be the average of the 8th and 9th values: (160 + 160) / 2 = 160\n\n4. Find the upper quartile (Q3), which is the median of the upper half of the data:\nThe upper half of the data has 16 values, so the upper quartile will be the average of the 24th and 25th values: (180 + 180) / 2 = 180\n\n5. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between Q3 and Q1:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 180 - 160 = 20\n\n6. Identify the lower and upper boundaries for outliers:\nLower boundary = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 160 - 1.5 * 20 = 130\nUpper boundary = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 180 + 1.5 * 20 = 210\n\n7. Check for any outliers:\nAll the heights of the students fall within the range of 130 to 210, so there are no outliers in the data."
