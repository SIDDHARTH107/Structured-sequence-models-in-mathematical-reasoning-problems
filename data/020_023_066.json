Assuming that you have $50,000 to invest, what is the amount of money that you should invest in each stock to achieve the optimal allocation?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the risk of the portfolio, we need to find the optimal allocation of investment to each stock. This can be done using the concept of portfolio variance and diversification. However, we need information about the correlation between the stocks to calculate the portfolio variance. Since this information is not provided, we can't find the optimal allocation.\n\nIf the correlation coefficients between the stocks were provided, we could use the following formula to calculate the portfolio variance:\n\nPortfolio Variance = w1^2 * σ1^2 + w2^2 * σ2^2 + w3^2 * σ3^2 + 2 * w1 * w2 * Cov(A, B) + 2 * w1 * w3 * Cov(A, C) + 2 * w2 * w3 * Cov(B, C)\n\nWhere:\n- w1, w2, and w3 are the weights of stocks A, B, and C in the portfolio, respectively.\n- σ1, σ2, and σ3 are the standard deviations of stocks A, B, and C, respectively.\n- Cov(A, B), Cov(A, C), and Cov(B, C) are the covariances between the stocks.\n\nTo minimize the portfolio variance, we would need to find the optimal weights (w1, w2, w3) that minimize the portfolio variance, subject to the constraint that w1 + w2 + w3 = 1.\n\nOnce the optimal weights are found, we can calculate the amount of money to invest in each stock using the following formula:\n\nAmount to invest in stock i = Total investment * weight of stock i\n\nFor example, if the optimal weights were found to be w1 = 0.4, w2 = 0.3, and w3 = 0.3, and you have $50,000 to invest, the amount of money you should invest in each stock would be:\n\nAmount to invest in stock A = $50,000 * 0.4 = $20,000\nAmount to invest in stock B = $50,000 * 0.3 = $15,000\nAmount to invest in stock C = $50,000 * 0.3 = $15,000"
