    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. To produce product A, it takes one hour on a machine of type X and one hour on a machine of type Y, and it can produce 100 units of A per day. To produce product B, it takes two hours on machine X and three hours on machine Y, and it can produce 80 units of B per day. \n\nThe company needs to know the optimal quantity of products A and B to produce each day to maximize their profit. The revenue from selling one unit of A is $10 and from selling one unit of B is $15. The cost of operating machine X for an hour is $5 and for machine Y is $3. \n\nUsing semi-definite programming, determine how many units of each product should the company produce daily to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can set up a linear programming model. Let x be the number of units of product A produced daily, and y be the number of units of product B produced daily. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nProfit = (10x + 15y) - (5(1x + 2y) + 3(1x + 3y))\n\nSimplify the profit function:\nProfit = 10x + 15y - 5x - 10y - 3x - 9y\nProfit = 2x - 4y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1x + 2y <= Hours available on machine X (let's call it Hx)\n1x + 3y <= Hours available on machine Y (let's call it Hy)\nx <= 100 (maximum units of A produced daily)\ny <= 80 (maximum units of B produced daily)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe don't have the information about the total hours available on machines X and Y, so we will assume that Hx and Hy are large enough to not be limiting factors in this problem.\n\nNow, we can use linear programming to solve for x and y:\n\nObjective function: Maximize 2x - 4y\n\nConstraints:\nx + 2y <= Hx\nx + 3y <= Hy\nx <= 100\ny <= 80\nx, y >= 0\n\nSolving this linear programming problem, we find that the optimal solution is to produce 100 units of product A and 0 units of product B daily. This will maximize the profit for the company."
