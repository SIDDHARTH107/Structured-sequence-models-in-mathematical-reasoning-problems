    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using Fourier transform, we first need to find the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation:\n\n$$ y''(x) + 4y(x) = 0 $$\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$$ r^2 + 4 = 0 $$\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n$$ r = \\pm 2i $$\n\nThus, the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\n$$ y(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x) $$\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the values of the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\n1) $y(0) = 0$:\n\n$$ 0 = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) $$\n\n$$ 0 = C_1 $$\n\nSo, $C_1 = 0$. The solution now becomes:\n\n$$ y(x) = C_2 \\sin(2x) $$\n\n2) $y(\\pi) = 2$:\n\n$$ 2 = C_2 \\sin(2\\pi) $$\n\nHowever, $\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$, which implies that we cannot find a value for $C_2$ that satisfies this boundary condition. This means that there is no solution to the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform method.\n\nIn conclusion, the given boundary value problem has no solution using the Fourier transform method."
