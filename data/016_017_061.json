    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the curve at the nth iteration as P(n). For the first iteration (n=1), the perimeter is simply the length of the initial line segment, which is 1 unit.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the perimeter doubles and the length of each segment is divided by the square root of 2. This is because the curve is formed by adding a new segment at a 90-degree angle to the previous one, and the length of the new segment is half the length of the previous segment due to the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the curve at the nth iteration can be expressed as:\n\nP(n) = P(n-1) * 2^(n-1) / 2^((n-1)/2)\n\nNow, we want to find the perimeter of the curve at the 8th iteration:\n\nP(8) = P(7) * 2^7 / 2^(7/2)\n\nSince we know that P(1) = 1, we can find P(8) by iterating through the formula:\n\nP(2) = 1 * 2 / 2^(1/2) = 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)\nP(3) = sqrt(2) * 4 / 2^(3/2) = 4 / sqrt(2) = 2 * sqrt(2)\nP(4) = 2 * sqrt(2) * 8 / 2^2 = 8\nP(5) = 8 * 16 / 2^(5/2) = 16 * sqrt(2)\nP(6) = 16 * sqrt(2) * 32 / 2^3 = 64 * sqrt(2)\nP(7) = 64 * sqrt(2) * 64 / 2^(7/2) = 128\nP(8) = 128 * 128 / 2^4 = 1024\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway Dragon Curve up to its 8th iteration is 1024 units."
