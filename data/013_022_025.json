    "message_1": "In the Dictator Game, a player is given 100 tokens and must decide how many tokens to keep for themselves and how many tokens to give to their partner. If the player keeps all 100 tokens, they receive a payoff of 100, but their partner receives nothing. If the player gives all 100 tokens to their partner, they receive a payoff of 0, but their partner receives a payoff of 200. What is the optimal number of tokens for the player to give to their partner to maximize their own expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, there is no strategic interaction between the players, as the partner has no influence on the decision of the player who is dividing the tokens. Therefore, the optimal number of tokens to give to the partner depends solely on the preferences of the player who is dividing the tokens.\n\nIf the player only cares about maximizing their own payoff, they should keep all 100 tokens for themselves, giving 0 tokens to their partner. This would result in a payoff of 100 for the player and 0 for their partner.\n\nHowever, if the player also cares about fairness or the well-being of their partner, they might choose to give some tokens to their partner. The optimal number of tokens to give in this case would depend on the player's preferences and how much they value their partner's payoff compared to their own."
