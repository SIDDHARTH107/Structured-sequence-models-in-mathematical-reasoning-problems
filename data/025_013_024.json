    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to C at P, we first need to find the derivative of the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1 with respect to x. This will give us the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nImplicitly differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x, we get:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = 3x^2 + 2\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dx, which represents the slope of the tangent line:\n\ndy/dx = (3x^2 + 2) / (2y)\n\nAt point P = (-1, 2), we can plug in the x and y values to find the slope of the tangent line:\n\ndy/dx = (3(-1)^2 + 2) / (2(2)) = (3 + 2) / 4 = 5/4\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line at P, we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the point P (-1, 2) and the slope 5/4, we get:\n\ny - 2 = (5/4)(x + 1)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n4(y - 2) = 5(x + 1)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get the equation of the tangent line:\n\n4y - 8 = 5x + 5\n5x - 4y + 13 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the line through P and Q. The slope of this line can be found using the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of P and Q, we get:\n\nm = (-5 - 2) / (3 - (-1)) = (-7) / 4\n\nNow, using the point-slope form of a line with point P and the slope -7/4, we get:\n\ny - 2 = (-7/4)(x + 1)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n4(y - 2) = -7(x + 1)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get the equation of the line through P and Q:\n\n4y - 8 = -7x - 7\n7x + 4y - 1 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to C at P is 5x - 4y + 13 = 0, and the equation of the line through P and Q is 7x + 4y - 1 = 0."
