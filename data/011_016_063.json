    "message_2": "To find the total number of debates held, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students and k is the size of the group (in this case, 2 students per debate).\n\nSo, we have C(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12-2)!)\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2!10!)\n\nC(12, 2) = (12 × 11 × 10!)/(2 × 10!)\n\nC(12, 2) = (12 × 11)/(2)\n\nC(12, 2) = 66\n\nSince each student is allowed to debate twice, we multiply the result by 2:\n\nTotal debates = 66 × 2 = 132\n\nSo, there were 132 debates held in total."
