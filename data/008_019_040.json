    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the third equation to make it easier to read:\n\n3x + (2 + 4i)y - 5z = 3 - 4i\n\nNow, let's start the elimination process. We will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -1/2 and the second equation by 2:\n\n-1x - 3/2y + i/2 z = -2\n2x - 4y + 6i z = 4\n\nNow, add the modified first and second equations:\n\n(-1x - 3/2y + i/2 z) + (2x - 4y + 6i z) = -2 + 4\nx - 5/2y + (13i/2)z = 2\n\nNow, we will eliminate x from the third equation. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -3/2 and the third equation by 2:\n\n-3x - 9/2y + 3i/2 z = -6\n6x + (4 + 8i)y - 10z = 6 - 8i\n\nNow, add the modified first and third equations:\n\n(-3x - 9/2y + 3i/2 z) + (6x + (4 + 8i)y - 10z) = -6 + 6 - 8i\n3x + (-1/2 + 8i)y - (19/2 - 3i/2)z = -8i\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\nx - 5/2y + (13i/2)z = 2\n(-1/2 + 8i)y - (19/2 - 3i/2)z = -8i\n\nTo eliminate y, we will multiply the first equation by (1/2 - 8i) and the second equation by 5:\n\n(1/2 - 8i)x - (25/4 - 20i)y + (13i/4 - 52)z = 2(1/2 - 8i)\n(-5/2 + 40i)y + (95/4 + 15i/4)z = -40i\n\nNow, add the modified first and second equations:\n\n[(1/2 - 8i)x - (25/4 - 20i)y + (13i/4 - 52)z] + [(-5/2 + 40i)y + (95/4 + 15i/4)z] = 2(1/2 - 8i) - 40i\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\n(1/2 - 8i)x + (15i/4 + 60)z = -64i + 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (64i - 1)/(1/2 - 8i)\n\nNow, substitute x back into the equation x - 5/2y + (13i/2)z = 2:\n\n(64i - 1)/(1/2 - 8i) - 5/2y + (13i/2)z = 2\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = [(64i - 1)/(1/2 - 8i) - 2 - (13i/2)z] / (-5/2)\n\nFinally, substitute x and y back into the original first equation:\n\n2x + 3y - i z = 4\n\nNow, we have:\n\n2[(64i - 1)/(1/2 - 8i)] + 3[[(64i - 1)/(1/2 - 8i) - 2 - (13i/2)z] / (-5/2)] - i z = 4\n\nSolve for z:\n\nz = [(2(64i - 1) + 3(64i - 1 - 2(1/2 - 8i) - 13i(-5/2)))/(1/2 - 8i) - 4]/i\n\nNow, we have the expressions for x, y, and z in terms of i:\n\nx = (64i - 1)/(1/2 - 8i)\ny = [(64i - 1)/(1/2 - 8i) - 2 - (13i/2)z] / (-5/2)\nz = [(2(64i - 1) + 3(64i - 1 - 2(1/2 - 8i) - 13i(-5/2)))/(1/2 - 8i) - 4]/i\n\nThese expressions represent the solutions for x, y, and z in terms of the imaginary unit i."
