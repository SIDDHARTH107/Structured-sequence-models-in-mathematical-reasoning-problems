    "message_2": "To perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reduce the dimensionality of a dataset with 10 variables to 3 principal components, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the dataset (if necessary).\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix.\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n4. Select the top 3 eigenvectors corresponding to the 3 largest eigenvalues.\n5. Project the original dataset onto the new 3-dimensional subspace.\n\nHowever, without the actual dataset, I cannot perform these calculations and provide you with the new matrix formed after applying PCA. If you provide the dataset, I can help you with the calculations."
