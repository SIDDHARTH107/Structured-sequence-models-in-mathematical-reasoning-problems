    "message_1": "A cylindrical tank has a height of 10 meters and a radius of 5 meters. The tank is being filled with water at a rate of 3 cubic meters per minute. How fast is the water level rising when the water is 4 meters deep?",
    "message_2": "Let V be the volume of the water in the tank, h be the height of the water, and r be the radius of the tank. We are given that r = 5 meters and the tank is being filled at a rate of dV/dt = 3 cubic meters per minute. We want to find the rate at which the water level is rising, which is dh/dt, when h = 4 meters.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h. Since the radius of the tank is constant (r = 5 meters), we can write the volume of the water in the tank as:\n\nV = π(5^2)h = 25πh\n\nNow, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = 3 cubic meters per minute, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n3 = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = 3 / (25π)\n\nFinally, we want to find the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 4 meters deep (h = 4 meters). Since the radius of the tank is constant and the problem does not depend on the height of the water, the rate at which the water level is rising will be the same for any height:\n\ndh/dt = 3 / (25π) meters per minute\n\nSo, the water level is rising at a rate of 3 / (25π) meters per minute when the water is 4 meters deep."
