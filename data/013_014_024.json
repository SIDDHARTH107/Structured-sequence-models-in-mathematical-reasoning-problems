    "message_1": "Consider an auction for a painting among 3 bidders. The true valuation of the painting is $500. The bidders' valuations of the painting are as follows: \n\nBidder 1:  $400\n\nBidder 2:  $600\n\nBidder 3:  $800\n\nIf the auction is run as a second-price sealed-bid auction, what is the winning bid and which bidder wins the painting?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the item, but they only pay the second-highest bid price. In this case, the bids are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $400\nBidder 2: $600\nBidder 3: $800\n\nBidder 3 has the highest bid at $800, so they win the painting. However, they only pay the second-highest bid, which is $600. So, the winning bid is $600, and Bidder 3 wins the painting."
