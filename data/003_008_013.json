    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to finding the area of triangles using trigonometry:\n\nA triangle has a base of length 10 meters and an altitude of 8 meters, forming a right angle at the base. Using trigonometry, find the area of the triangle. Round your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "Since the triangle has a right angle at the base, we can use the basic formula for the area of a right triangle, which is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 10 meters and the height (altitude) is 8 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10 * 8\nArea = 5 * 8\nArea = 40 square meters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 40 square meters. Since the problem asked for the answer to be rounded to the nearest tenth, the final answer is 40.0 square meters."
