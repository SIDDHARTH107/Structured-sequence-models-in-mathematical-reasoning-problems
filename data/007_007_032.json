    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 4x + 5y = 163, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution and then use the general solution formula for Diophantine equations.\n\nFirst, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 5, which is 1. Since 1 divides 163, there exists a solution for this equation.\n\nNow, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution:\n\n1. 5 = 1 * 4 + 1\n2. 1 = 5 - 1 * 4\n\nFrom equation (2), we have:\n\n1 = 5 - 4\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by 163:\n\n163 = 5 * 163 - 4 * 163\n\nSo, a particular solution is x = -163 and y = 163.\n\nNow, we can use the general solution formula for Diophantine equations:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions we found, a = 4, b = 5, d = gcd(4, 5) = 1, and n is an integer.\n\nx = -163 + 5n\ny = 163 - 4n\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for n:\n\nn = 0: x = -163, y = 163\nn = 1: x = -158, y = 159\nn = 2: x = -153, y = 155\nn = 3: x = -148, y = 151\nn = 4: x = -143, y = 147\n...\n\nThese are the integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 4x + 5y = 163."
