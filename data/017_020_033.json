    "message_2": "To find all the isomorphism classes of groups of order 40, we first note that 40 = 2^3 * 5. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their structures.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is that there is one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be of order 8. The possible structures for a group of order 8 are Z_8 (cyclic group), Z_2 x Z_4, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, and D_4 (dihedral group).\n\n2. Sylow 5-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possibilities are 1 and 8. If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be of order 5 and isomorphic to Z_5. If there are 8 Sylow 5-subgroups, they are also of order 5 and isomorphic to Z_5.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: One Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup\nSince both subgroups are unique, they are normal in the group. The group is then a direct product of the Sylow subgroups. The possible isomorphism classes in this case are:\n- Z_8 x Z_5\n- Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_5\n- Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_5\n- D_4 x Z_5\n\nCase 2: One Sylow 2-subgroup and eight Sylow 5-subgroups\nIn this case, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, but the Sylow 5-subgroups are not. We can use the semidirect product to combine the Sylow subgroups. However, since the automorphism group of Z_5 is of order 4, which is coprime to 8, the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 5-subgroups is trivial. This means that the semidirect product is actually a direct product, and we have already considered these cases in Case 1.\n\nThus, the isomorphism classes of groups of order 40 are:\n- Z_8 x Z_5\n- Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_5\n- Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_5\n- D_4 x Z_5"
