    "message_1": "A small business owner produces and sells handmade candles. The cost of producing each candle is $2, and she sells them for $5 each. However, there is a fixed overhead cost of $100 for her production facility each day. How many candles does the business owner need to sell per day to break even?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of candles the business owner needs to sell to break even.\n\nThe revenue from selling x candles is 5x, and the cost of producing x candles is 2x. The fixed overhead cost is $100. To break even, the revenue must equal the total cost (production cost + fixed overhead cost).\n\n5x = 2x + 100\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides of the equation:\n\n3x = 100\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 100/3 â‰ˆ 33.33\n\nSince the business owner cannot sell a fraction of a candle, she needs to sell 34 candles per day to break even."
