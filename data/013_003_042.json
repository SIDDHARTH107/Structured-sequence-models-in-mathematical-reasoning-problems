    "message_1": "In Ultimatum Game, Player 1 proposes a split of $100 with Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the split, they keep the money as proposed. If they reject the split, both players get nothing. What is the minimum amount that Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum amount that Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer is $1. This is because if Player 2 rejects the offer, they will get nothing, so accepting $1 is still better than getting nothing. However, this is assuming that Player 2 is acting purely rationally and only cares about maximizing their own monetary gain. In reality, people may reject offers they perceive as unfair, even if it means getting nothing. So, while theoretically $1 is the minimum amount, in practice, Player 1 may need to offer a higher amount to increase the likelihood of acceptance."
