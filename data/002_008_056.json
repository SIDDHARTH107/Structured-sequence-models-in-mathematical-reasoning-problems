    "message_1": "A right circular cone has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 8 cm. What is the volume of this cone?",
    "message_2": "The volume V of a right circular cone can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 5 cm and the height h is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (1/3)π(5²)(8)\nV = (1/3)π(25)(8)\nV = (1/3)(3.14159)(200)\nV ≈ 104.71976 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 104.72 cubic centimeters."
