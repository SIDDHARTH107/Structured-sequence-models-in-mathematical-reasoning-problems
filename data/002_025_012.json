    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has a base of 12 cm and equal sides of 8 cm. What is the length of the altitude drawn from the apex to the base?",
    "message_2": "Let's call the isosceles triangle ABC, where A is the apex and B and C are the base vertices. Let's also call the midpoint of the base D. Since the triangle is isosceles, AD is the altitude.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude AD. In right triangle ABD, we have:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n\nSince the base BC is 12 cm, BD is half of the base, which is 6 cm. The equal sides AB and AC are both 8 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n8^2 = AD^2 + 6^2\n64 = AD^2 + 36\n64 - 36 = AD^2\n28 = AD^2\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of AD:\n\nAD = √28 ≈ 5.29 cm\n\nSo, the length of the altitude drawn from the apex to the base is approximately 5.29 cm."
