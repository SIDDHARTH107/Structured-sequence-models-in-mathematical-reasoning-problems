    "message_2": "To solve the Laplace's equation in this 2-dimensional region with the given boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the potential V(x, y) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\nV(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)\n\nSubstituting this into the Laplace's equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)Y(y)}{X(x)Y(y)} + \\frac{X(x)Y''(y)}{X(x)Y(y)} = 0$\n\nDividing both sides by V(x, y) = X(x)Y(y), we obtain:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -k²:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$\n\n$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = k^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n$X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$\n\n$Y''(y) - k^2Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(ky) + D\\sinh(ky)$\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. V(0, y) = X(0)Y(y) = 0 => X(0) = 0 => A = 0\n2. V(2, y) = X(2)Y(y) = 0 => X(2) = 0 => B\\sin(2k) = 0 => k = \\frac{n\\pi}{2}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n3. V(x, 0) = X(x)Y(0) = V_0 => Y(0) = 1 => C = 1\n4. V(x, 2) = X(x)Y(2) = V_0 => Y(2) = 1 => D\\sinh(2k) = 0 => D = 0 (since k ≠ 0)\n\nNow we have:\n\n$X(x) = B\\sin(kx)$ with $k = \\frac{n\\pi}{2}$\n\n$Y(y) = \\cosh(ky)$\n\nThe potential V(x, y) can be expressed as a sum of solutions for each value of n:\n\n$V(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}x)\\cosh(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}y)$\n\nTo find the coefficients $B_n$, we use the boundary condition V(x, 2) = V_0:\n\n$V_0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}x)\\cosh(n\\pi)$\n\nWe can use Fourier sine series to find $B_n$:\n\n$B_n = \\frac{2}{2}\\int_{0}^{2} V_0 \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}x) dx = V_0\\int_{0}^{2} \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}x) dx$\n\n$B_n = \\frac{4V_0}{n\\pi}(-1)^{(n-1)/2}$ for odd n, and $B_n = 0$ for even n.\n\nFinally, the potential V(x, y) is given by:\n\n$V(x, y) = \\sum_{n \\, odd}^{\\infty} \\frac{4V_0}{n\\pi}(-1)^{(n-1)/2} \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}x)\\cosh(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}y)$\n\nNow we can find the potential at point (1, 1) with $V_0 = 10$V:\n\n$V(1, 1) = \\sum_{n \\, odd}^{\\infty} \\frac{40}{n\\pi}(-1)^{(n-1)/2} \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{2})\\cosh(\\frac{n\\pi}{2})$\n\nThis is an infinite series, so we can approximate the potential by taking a finite number of terms. For example, taking the first 10 odd terms:\n\n$V(1, 1) \\approx 40\\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\cosh(\\frac{\\pi}{2})}{\\pi} - \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})\\cosh(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})}{3\\pi} + \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{2})\\cosh(\\frac{5\\pi}{2})}{5\\pi} - \\cdots\\right)$\n\n$V(1, 1) \\approx 6.837$V"
