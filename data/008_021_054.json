    "message_2": "To determine whether this system has a solution or not using the concept of singular matrices, we first need to look at the coefficient matrix of the system:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}\n\nNext, we calculate the determinant of this matrix:\n\ndet(A) = (2)(6) - (3)(4) = 12 - 12 = 0\n\nSince the determinant of the coefficient matrix is 0, the matrix is singular. This means that the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution.\n\nNow, let's look at the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{3}{2} & 4.5 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\nThere is no row in the reduced row echelon form that corresponds to an inconsistent equation (i.e., a row of the form [0 0 ... 0 | a] with a â‰  0). Therefore, the system is consistent.\n\nSince the matrix is singular and the system is consistent, this means that the system has infinitely many solutions."
