    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a sample size of 500 people, 30 individuals who are over the age of 60 and have a pre-existing medical condition will be affected by a rare disease, given that the overall probability of the disease affecting someone in this demographic group is 5%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, 30 individuals affected by the rare disease)\n- n is the sample size (500 people)\n- k is the number of successes (30 individuals)\n- p is the probability of success (5% or 0.05)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 30) = (500 choose 30) * (0.05)^30 * (1-0.05)^(500-30)\n\nFirst, calculate (500 choose 30):\n\n(500 choose 30) = 500! / (30!(500-30)!) ≈ 2.225 * 10^37\n\nNow, calculate (0.05)^30 ≈ 8.69 * 10^-21\n\nAnd, calculate (1-0.05)^(500-30) ≈ 1.22 * 10^-7\n\nFinally, multiply all the values:\n\nP(X = 30) ≈ (2.225 * 10^37) * (8.69 * 10^-21) * (1.22 * 10^-7) ≈ 0.023\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 30 individuals out of 500 who are over the age of 60 and have a pre-existing medical condition will be affected by the rare disease is approximately 2.3%."
