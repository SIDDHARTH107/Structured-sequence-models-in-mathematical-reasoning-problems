    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector with a central angle of 45 degrees, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) * 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 45 degrees and the radius is 8 cm.\n\nArc length = (45 / 360) * 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/8) * 16π\nArc length = 2π cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector.\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = 2π + 2(8)\nPerimeter = 2π + 16\n\nThe perimeter of the sector with a central angle of 45 degrees is 2π + 16 cm."
