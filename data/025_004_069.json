    "message_1": "Let C be an irreducible algebraic curve in the projective plane defined by the equation x^2*y - x*y^2 + x^2*z - y^2*z = 0. Determine the degree of C and the genus of C.",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of the curve C, we need to find the highest total degree of any monomial in the equation. In this case, the equation is:\n\nx^2*y - x*y^2 + x^2*z - y^2*z = 0\n\nThe highest total degree of any monomial is 3 (for example, x^2*y has a total degree of 3). Therefore, the degree of the curve C is 3.\n\nNow, to determine the genus of the curve C, we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2) / 2\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In this case, d = 3, so we have:\n\ng = (3 - 1)(3 - 2) / 2 = (2)(1) / 2 = 1\n\nThus, the genus of the curve C is 1."
