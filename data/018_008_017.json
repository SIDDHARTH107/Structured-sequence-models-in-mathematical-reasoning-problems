    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nLet's find A x B:\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow let's find B x A:\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nTo prove that A x B is not equal to B x A, we can show that there exists at least one element in A x B that is not in B x A or vice versa.\n\nConsider the ordered pair (1, 4). This pair is in A x B, but it is not in B x A. Similarly, consider the ordered pair (4, 1). This pair is in B x A, but it is not in A x B.\n\nSince there are elements in A x B that are not in B x A and elements in B x A that are not in A x B, we can conclude that A x B is not equal to B x A."
