    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, competing in a market. Both firms offer a homogenous product, and the market demand is Q = 100 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. Each firm has a marginal cost of production of $20. Firm A decides to set a price of $50. What price should Firm B set in order to maximize its profits?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price for Firm B, we need to first find the residual demand that Firm B faces given Firm A's price of $50. \n\n1. Calculate the quantity demanded at Firm A's price:\nQ = 100 - P\nQ = 100 - 50\nQ = 50\n\nSo, 50 units are demanded at Firm A's price of $50.\n\n2. Calculate the residual demand for Firm B:\nSince both firms offer a homogenous product, consumers will buy from the firm with the lower price. If Firm B sets a price equal to or higher than $50, it will not sell any units, as consumers will buy from Firm A. Therefore, Firm B should set a price lower than $50 to capture the market.\n\nLet P_B be the price set by Firm B, and Q_B be the quantity demanded for Firm B. The demand function for Firm B is:\n\nQ_B = 100 - P_B\n\n3. Calculate Firm B's profit function:\nProfit = Total Revenue - Total Cost\nTotal Revenue = Price × Quantity = P_B × Q_B\nTotal Cost = Marginal Cost × Quantity = 20 × Q_B\n\nProfit_B = P_B × Q_B - 20 × Q_B\n\n4. Substitute the demand function into the profit function:\nProfit_B = P_B × (100 - P_B) - 20 × (100 - P_B)\n\n5. Differentiate the profit function with respect to P_B and set the derivative equal to 0 to find the optimal price:\n\nd(Profit_B)/dP_B = (100 - P_B) - P_B - 20 = 0\n\n6. Solve for P_B:\n80 - 2P_B = 0\n2P_B = 80\nP_B = 40\n\nSo, Firm B should set a price of $40 to maximize its profits."
