Determine which one of the two groups G is isomorphic to if G = {e, a, b, c} and the operation table of G is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n & e & a & b & c \\\\\n\\hline\ne & e & a & b & c \\\\\na & a & e & c & b \\\\\nb & b & c & e & a \\\\\nc & c & b & a & e \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$",
    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will first analyze the possible orders of the elements in G. Since G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 4. Thus, the possible orders for elements in G are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nWe know that the identity element e has order 1. Now, let's consider the other elements a, b, and c. If any of these elements have order 4, then G would be generated by that element and would be isomorphic to the cyclic group C4. If none of the elements have order 4, then all of them must have order 2, and G would be isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given operation table to determine which group G is isomorphic to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n & e & a & b & c \\\\\n\\hline\ne & e & a & b & c \\\\\na & a & e & c & b \\\\\nb & b & c & e & a \\\\\nc & c & b & a & e \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFrom the table, we can see that:\n\n- a * a = e, so a has order 2.\n- b * b = e, so b has order 2.\n- c * c = e, so c has order 2.\n\nSince all non-identity elements have order 2, G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
