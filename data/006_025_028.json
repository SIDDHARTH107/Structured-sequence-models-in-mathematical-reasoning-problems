What is the probability of both the lead singer hitting the high note and the drummer hitting the specific drum fill correctly in the same performance?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both events happening at the same time, we can multiply the individual probabilities together. \n\nThe probability of the lead singer hitting the high note correctly is 0.75, and the probability of the drummer hitting the specific drum fill correctly is 0.6.\n\n0.75 * 0.6 = 0.45\n\nSo, the probability of both the lead singer hitting the high note and the drummer hitting the specific drum fill correctly in the same performance is 0.45 or 45%."
