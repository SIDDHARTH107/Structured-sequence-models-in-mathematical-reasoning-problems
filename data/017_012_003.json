    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16 with an element of order 8. Let a be an element of G with order 8, i.e., a^8 = e and a^k ≠ e for 1 ≤ k < 8, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 16, by the Sylow theorems, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. Let H be a subgroup of G generated by a, i.e., H = ⟨a⟩. Since the order of a is 8, the order of H is also 8, and thus H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 16 and |H| = 8, we have |G/H| = 2. Thus, G/H is isomorphic to C2, the cyclic group of order 2. Let b be an element of G such that G/H = ⟨bH⟩, where bH is the coset of H in G.\n\nNow, we have three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: G = ⟨a, b⟩ and b^2 = e.\nIn this case, G is generated by a and b, and b has order 2. Since G/H is isomorphic to C2, we have (bH)^2 = H, which implies b^2 ∈ H. Since b^2 has order 2 and H is generated by a with order 8, the only possibility is b^2 = e. Now, G is generated by a and b, with a having order 8 and b having order 2. Thus, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8.\n\nCase 2: G = ⟨a, b⟩ and b^2 = a^4.\nIn this case, G is generated by a and b, and b^2 = a^4. Since G/H is isomorphic to C2, we have (bH)^2 = H, which implies b^2 ∈ H. The only element of order 2 in H is a^4, so b^2 = a^4. Now, G is generated by a and b, with a having order 8 and b^2 = a^4. Thus, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nCase 3: G = ⟨a⟩.\nIn this case, G is generated by a, which has order 8. Since G has order 16, there must be an element of order 16 in G. Let c be an element of G with order 16. Then, G = ⟨c⟩, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16."
