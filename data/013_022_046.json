    "message_2": "In this Dictator game, if the dictator keeps $40, the receiver gets the remaining amount, which is $100 - $40 = $60.\n\nThe dictatorial power index is the proportion of the total amount that the dictator keeps for themselves. In this case, the dictator keeps $40 out of $100, so the dictatorial power index is:\n\nDictatorial Power Index = (Amount kept by dictator) / (Total amount)\n                                     = $40 / $100\n                                     = 0.4 or 40%\n\nSo, the dictatorial power index in this game is 40%."
