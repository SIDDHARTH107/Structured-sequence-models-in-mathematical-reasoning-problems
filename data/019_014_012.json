    "message_2": "To prove that a set with three elements is finite using higher-order logic, we will use the definition of a finite set and the concept of bijections.\n\nDefinition: A set A is finite if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one and onto function) between A and a set of the form {1, 2, ..., n} for some natural number n.\n\nLet A be a set with three elements, i.e., A = {a, b, c}.\n\nWe will now define a bijection f between A and the set {1, 2, 3}.\n\nf: A -> {1, 2, 3}\n\nDefine f as follows:\n\nf(a) = 1\nf(b) = 2\nf(c) = 3\n\nWe will now show that f is a bijection.\n\n1. One-to-one (Injective): For all x, y in A, if f(x) = f(y), then x = y.\n\nSuppose f(x) = f(y) for some x, y in A. Then, we have the following cases:\n\nCase 1: x = a and y = a. In this case, f(x) = f(a) = 1 and f(y) = f(a) = 1. Since f(x) = f(y), we have x = y = a.\n\nCase 2: x = b and y = b. In this case, f(x) = f(b) = 2 and f(y) = f(b) = 2. Since f(x) = f(y), we have x = y = b.\n\nCase 3: x = c and y = c. In this case, f(x) = f(c) = 3 and f(y) = f(c) = 3. Since f(x) = f(y), we have x = y = c.\n\nThere are no other cases since A has only three elements. Thus, f is one-to-one.\n\n2. Onto (Surjective): For all y in {1, 2, 3}, there exists an x in A such that f(x) = y.\n\nFor y = 1, we have f(a) = 1, so there exists an x = a in A such that f(x) = 1.\nFor y = 2, we have f(b) = 2, so there exists an x = b in A such that f(x) = 2.\nFor y = 3, we have f(c) = 3, so there exists an x = c in A such that f(x) = 3.\n\nSince we have shown that for all y in {1, 2, 3}, there exists an x in A such that f(x) = y, f is onto.\n\nSince f is both one-to-one and onto, it is a bijection between A and {1, 2, 3}. Therefore, by definition, the set A is finite."
