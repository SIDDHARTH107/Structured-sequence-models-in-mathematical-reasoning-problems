    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the integral of the force along the path from point (1,1) to (3,5). Since the force is constant (10 N), we can simplify the problem by finding the displacement along the line and then multiplying it by the force.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the straight line passing through points (1,1) and (3,5). Using the slope-point form:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nm = (5 - 1) / (3 - 1)\nm = 4 / 2\nm = 2\n\nNow we have the slope, we can find the equation of the line using the point-slope form:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\ny - 1 = 2(x - 1)\ny = 2x - 1\n\nNow, let's find the displacement along the line. We can use the distance formula:\n\nd = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\nd = √((3 - 1)^2 + (5 - 1)^2)\nd = √(2^2 + 4^2)\nd = √(4 + 16)\nd = √20\n\nNow that we have the displacement, we can find the work done by the force:\n\nW = F × d × cos(θ)\n\nSince the force is applied along the straight line, the angle between the force and the displacement is 0 degrees. Therefore, cos(θ) = 1.\n\nW = 10 N × √20 × 1\nW = 10√20 Nm\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 10√20 newton-meters."
