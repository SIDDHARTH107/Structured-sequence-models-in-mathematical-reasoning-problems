    "message_2": "To find the value of u(x,t) when x = 1 and t = 2, and given that c = 1, we can plug these values into the wave equation:\n\nu(x,t) = f(x - ct) + g(x + ct)\n\nu(1,2) = f(1 - 1*2) + g(1 + 1*2)\n\nu(1,2) = f(-1) + g(3)\n\nNow, we can use the given functions f(x) = 3x and g(x) = x^2 - 1:\n\nu(1,2) = 3(-1) + (3^2 - 1)\n\nu(1,2) = -3 + (9 - 1)\n\nu(1,2) = -3 + 8\n\nu(1,2) = 5\n\nSo, the value of u when x = 1 and t = 2 is 5."
