    "message_2": "To prove that there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 6, we will first use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 6 = 2 * 3, we know that any group of order 6 will have a 2-Sylow subgroup of order 2 and a 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3.\n\nLet G be a group of order 6. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can only be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can only be 1.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, say H, of order 2. Since the order of H is 2, it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_2. Similarly, there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, say K, of order 3, which must be isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_3. Since both H and K are normal in G (as they are the unique Sylow subgroups), we can use the internal direct product theorem to conclude that G is isomorphic to the external direct product of H and K, which is Z_2 x Z_3. Since Z_2 x Z_3 is isomorphic to Z_6 (the cyclic group of order 6), G must be isomorphic to Z_6.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3\nIn this case, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 2. Let a be an element of order 2 in G. Since there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup K of order 3, which is normal in G, we can consider the conjugation action of a on K. Since K is normal, aKa^{-1} = K for all a in G. Let b be a generator of K. Then, there exists an integer k such that ab = b^ka. Since a^2 = e (the identity element), we have a^{-1} = a. Thus, aba = b^k. Multiplying both sides by a on the right, we get ab = b^ka^2 = b^k. Therefore, ab = b^k.\n\nNow, we have the following possibilities for k:\n1. k = 1: In this case, ab = b, which implies a = e, a contradiction since a has order 2.\n2. k = 2: In this case, ab = b^2. This gives us the presentation of the symmetric group S_3: G = <a, b | a^2 = b^3 = (ab)^2 = e>.\n3. k = 3: In this case, ab = b^3 = e, which implies a = b^{-1}, another contradiction since a has order 2 and b has order 3.\n\nThus, the only possibility for G in this case is that it is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3.\n\nIn conclusion, there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 6: the cyclic group Z_6 and the symmetric group S_3."
