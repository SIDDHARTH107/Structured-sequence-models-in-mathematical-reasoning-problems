    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors A and B, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of A and B, and θ is the angle between the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (3)(-1) + (4)(2) + (-2)(5) = -3 + 8 - 10 = -5\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3^2 + 4^2 + (-2)^2) = √(9 + 16 + 4) = √29\n\n|B| = √((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 5^2) = √(1 + 4 + 25) = √30\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the angle θ:\n\n-5 = (√29)(√30) cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by the magnitudes:\n\ncos(θ) = -5 / (√29 * √30)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(-5 / (√29 * √30))\n\nθ ≈ 131.87°\n\nSo, the angle between vectors A and B is approximately 131.87°."
