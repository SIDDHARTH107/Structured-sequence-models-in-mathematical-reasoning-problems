    "message_2": "To find the average velocity of the fluid flow, we need to integrate the velocity profile over the height of the channel and divide by the height. However, since the problem asks to use Fourier transform, let's first find the Fourier transform of the velocity profile.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a function $f(y)$ is given by:\n\n$$F(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(y) e^{-iky} dy$$\n\nIn our case, the function is $u(y) = 2U \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{H} y)$. The Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{\\cos(ax)\\} = \\pi[\\delta(k-a) + \\delta(k+a)]$$\n\nwhere $\\delta(k)$ is the Dirac delta function. Therefore, the Fourier transform of the velocity profile is:\n\n$$U(k) = 2U \\pi \\left[\\delta\\left(k-\\frac{\\pi}{H}\\right) + \\delta\\left(k+\\frac{\\pi}{H}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nNow, we can find the average velocity by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the product of the Fourier transform of the velocity profile and the Fourier transform of the height function, which is a rectangle function with width $H$. The Fourier transform of a rectangle function is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{\\text{rect}(y/H)\\} = H \\text{sinc}(kH)$$\n\nwhere $\\text{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$. The product of the Fourier transforms is:\n\n$$U(k) \\cdot H \\text{sinc}(kH) = 2U^2 \\pi H \\left[\\delta\\left(k-\\frac{\\pi}{H}\\right) + \\delta\\left(k+\\frac{\\pi}{H}\\right)\\right] \\text{sinc}(kH)$$\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform, we get:\n\n$$u_{avg}(y) = 2U \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{H} y) \\cdot H \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{H} y\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can integrate this function over the height of the channel and divide by the height to find the average velocity:\n\n$$u_{avg} = \\frac{1}{H} \\int_0^H 2U \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{H} y) \\cdot H \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{H} y\\right) dy$$\n\nSince the sinc function is equal to 1 at y=0, the integral simplifies to:\n\n$$u_{avg} = \\frac{1}{H} \\int_0^H 2U \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{H} y) dy$$\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\n$$u_{avg} = \\frac{2U}{\\pi}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for $U$ and $H$, we find the average velocity:\n\n$$u_{avg} = \\frac{2(0.3)}{\\pi} \\approx 0.191 m/s$$\n\nNext, we need to find the maximum velocity gradient in the flow. The velocity gradient is given by the derivative of the velocity profile with respect to $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{du}{dy} = -\\frac{2U\\pi}{H} \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{H} y)$$\n\nThe maximum velocity gradient occurs when the sine function is equal to 1:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = -\\frac{2(0.3)\\pi}{0.1} = -6\\pi$$\n\nSo, the maximum velocity gradient is $6\\pi$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the ratio of the maximum velocity to the spatially averaged velocity:\n\n$$\\frac{U_{max}}{u_{avg}} = \\frac{0.3}{0.191} \\approx 1.57$$\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The average velocity of the fluid flow is approximately 0.191 m/s.\n- The maximum velocity gradient in the flow is 6Ï€.\n- The ratio of the maximum velocity to the spatially averaged velocity is approximately 1.57."
