    "message_2": "To show that a group G of order 35 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, we know that G has a 5-Sylow subgroup P and a 7-Sylow subgroup Q, with orders 5 and 7 respectively.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups, n_7, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one 5-Sylow subgroup and one 7-Sylow subgroup, they are both normal in G (as any conjugate of a Sylow subgroup is also a Sylow subgroup, and there's only one of each). Let P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 5 and b has order 7.\n\nNow, consider the element ab in G. Since P and Q are normal in G, we have:\n\n(ab)^5 = a^5b^5 = e (since a^5 = e and b^5 is in Q, which is normal)\n(ab)^7 = a^7b^7 = e (since a^7 is in P, which is normal, and b^7 = e)\n\nThus, the order of ab divides both 5 and 7, which are prime numbers. The only possibility is that the order of ab is 1, which means ab = e. Therefore, a and b commute.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by a and b, i.e., H = ⟨a, b⟩. Since a and b commute, any element in H can be written as a^i b^j for some integers i and j. The order of H is at least lcm(5, 7) = 35, but since |G| = 35, we must have H = G.\n\nNow we have two cases:\n\n1) G is cyclic: In this case, G has an element of order 35, and we are done.\n\n2) G is not cyclic: In this case, G is generated by two commuting elements a and b of orders 5 and 7, respectively. Then G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, i.e., G ≅ C_5 × C_7, where C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group G has order 35, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
