    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we first need to find the eigenvalues. We do this by solving the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nThe characteristic equation for matrix A is:\n\n|A - λI| = |(4 - λ) (3 - λ) - (2 * 1)| = (4 - λ)(3 - λ) - 2\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 10 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation, which represent the eigenvalues. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (7 ± √(7^2 - 4 * 10)) / 2\nλ = (7 ± √(49 - 40)) / 2\nλ = (7 ± √9) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are:\n\nλ1 = (7 + 3) / 2 = 5\nλ2 = (7 - 3) / 2 = 2\n\nNow that we have the eigenvalues, we can find the eigenvectors by solving the following equation for each eigenvalue:\n\n(A - λI) * v = 0\n\nFor λ1 = 5:\n\n(4 - 5)  2   (x1)   (0)\n 1    (3 - 5)  (x2) =  (0)\n\n-1  2   (x1)   (0)\n 1 -2   (x2) =  (0)\n\nWe can see that x1 = 2x2. Let x2 = 1, then x1 = 2. So, the eigenvector for λ1 = 5 is:\n\nv1 = [2, 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 2:\n\n(4 - 2)  2   (x1)   (0)\n 1    (3 - 2)  (x2) =  (0)\n\n 2  2   (x1)   (0)\n 1  1   (x2) =  (0)\n\nWe can see that x1 = -x2. Let x2 = 1, then x1 = -1. So, the eigenvector for λ2 = 2 is:\n\nv2 = [-1, 1]\n\nNow, we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 5, Eigenvector v1 = [2, 1]\nEigenvalue λ2 = 2, Eigenvector v2 = [-1, 1]\n\nTo diagonalize matrix A, we can form the matrix P with the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D with the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nP = [ 2 -1 ]\n      [ 1  1 ]\n\nD = [ 5  0 ]\n      [ 0  2 ]\n\nNow, matrix A is diagonalized as A = PDP^(-1)."
