    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of widgets to maximize profit, we first need to find the profit function. The profit function, P(x), is the difference between the revenue function, R(x), and the cost function, C(x). \n\nGiven the cost per unit is $10, the cost function is C(x) = 10x.\n\nNow, we can find the profit function: P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (100x - 0.5x^2) - 10x.\n\nSimplify the profit function: P(x) = -0.5x^2 + 90x.\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the profit function. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b / 2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic function (a = -0.5 and b = 90).\n\nx = -90 / (2 * -0.5) = -90 / -1 = 90.\n\nSo, the optimal number of widgets the company should produce to maximize their profit is 90 units."
