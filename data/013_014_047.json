The cake is worth $10, and each individual values the cake differently. Person A values the cake at $7 and person B values the cake at $3. Using mechanism design, construct a fair mechanism for dividing the cake between the two individuals.\n\nWhat mechanism (algorithm) would you recommend, and how do you guarantee that both people will have a fair share of the cake?",
    "message_2": "I would recommend the \"Divide and Choose\" mechanism, which is a simple and fair method for dividing the cake between the two individuals.\n\nHere's how the mechanism works:\n\n1. Person A, who values the cake at $7, is asked to divide the cake into two pieces that they believe are worth $3.50 each (half of their valuation).\n2. Person B, who values the cake at $3, then chooses the piece they prefer.\n\nThis mechanism guarantees a fair share for both individuals because:\n\n- Person A divides the cake into two equal parts according to their valuation, ensuring that they are indifferent between the two pieces. Therefore, they will be satisfied with either piece.\n- Person B has the opportunity to choose the piece they prefer, ensuring that they get at least half of their valuation ($1.50) or more if they believe one piece is larger than the other.\n\nIn this way, both individuals receive a fair share of the cake according to their valuations, and the mechanism is incentive-compatible, as both parties have an incentive to follow the rules."
