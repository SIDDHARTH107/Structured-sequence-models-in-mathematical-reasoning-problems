Here's a precise numerical problem for them to solve:\n\nSuppose we have two mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds, X and Y, with Hodge numbers h(X) = (1, 101, 1) and h(Y) = (1, 1, 101). Compute the mirror symmetry exchange map from H^2(X, Z) to H^{2,2}(Y, Z) explicitly.",
    "message_2": "To compute the mirror symmetry exchange map from H^2(X, Z) to H^{2,2}(Y, Z) explicitly, we need to understand the relationship between the Hodge numbers of the mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y.\n\nThe Hodge diamond for X is given by:\n\n```\n  1\n 0 101 0\n  1\n```\n\nAnd the Hodge diamond for Y is given by:\n\n```\n  1\n 0 1 0\n  101\n```\n\nMirror symmetry states that the Hodge numbers of mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds are related by h^{p,q}(X) = h^{q,p}(Y). In our case, we have h^{1,1}(X) = 101 and h^{2,2}(Y) = 101. The exchange map between H^2(X, Z) and H^{2,2}(Y, Z) can be computed using the following steps:\n\n1. Identify a basis for H^2(X, Z). Since h^{1,1}(X) = 101, we can choose a basis {ω_1, ω_2, ..., ω_101} for H^2(X, Z).\n\n2. Compute the periods of the basis elements with respect to the complex structure of Y. This involves integrating the basis elements over a basis of 3-cycles in Y. Let Π(ω_i) denote the period vector of ω_i with respect to Y.\n\n3. The mirror symmetry exchange map is given by sending each basis element ω_i of H^2(X, Z) to the corresponding period vector Π(ω_i) in H^{2,2}(Y, Z).\n\nIn summary, the mirror symmetry exchange map is given by:\n\nω_i ↦ Π(ω_i) for i = 1, 2, ..., 101.\n\nTo compute the period vectors Π(ω_i) explicitly, one would need more information about the specific Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y, such as their defining equations and complex structures."
