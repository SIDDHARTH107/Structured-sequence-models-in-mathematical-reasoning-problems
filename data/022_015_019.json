    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\sqrt{z^2 - 1}$ using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first note that $f(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ except for a branch cut along the real axis from $-1$ to $1$. \n\nNow, we want to find a function $g(z)$ that agrees with $f(z)$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$ and satisfies the reflection symmetry property $g(\\bar{z}) = \\overline{g(z)}$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$. \n\nUsing the Schwarz reflection principle, we can define $g(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$\ng(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) & \\text{if } z \\in \\mathbb{H} \\\\\n\\overline{f(\\bar{z})} & \\text{if } z \\in \\mathbb{H}'\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to show that $g(z)$ is analytic on $\\mathbb{H} \\cup \\mathbb{H}'$ except for a branch cut along the real axis from $-1$ to $1$. \n\nFirst, let's consider the case when $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$. Since $f(z)$ is analytic in $\\mathbb{H}$, it follows that $g(z) = f(z)$ is also analytic in $\\mathbb{H}$. \n\nNext, let's consider the case when $z \\in \\mathbb{H}'$. Since $f(z)$ is analytic in $\\mathbb{H}$, it follows that $f(\\bar{z})$ is analytic in $\\mathbb{H}'$. Furthermore, since the complex conjugate of an analytic function is also analytic, it follows that $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is analytic in $\\mathbb{H}'$. \n\nFinally, we need to show that $g(z)$ is continuous on the real axis except for the branch cut from $-1$ to $1$. For $z$ on the real axis and outside the interval $[-1, 1]$, we have $f(z) = \\pm\\sqrt{z^2 - 1}$, which is continuous. Since $g(z) = f(z)$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$ and $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{H}'$, it follows that $g(z)$ is continuous on the real axis except for the branch cut from $-1$ to $1$. \n\nThus, we have found an expression for $g(z)$ that agrees with $f(z)$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$, satisfies the reflection symmetry property $g(\\bar{z}) = \\overline{g(z)}$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$, and is analytic on $\\mathbb{H} \\cup \\mathbb{H}'$ except for a branch cut along the real axis from $-1$ to $1$."
