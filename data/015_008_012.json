    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant (δ) is a universal constant that appears in the study of bifurcation diagrams of nonlinear iterative maps, such as the logistic map. It is named after the mathematician Mitchell Feigenbaum, who first discovered it. The Feigenbaum constant is approximately equal to δ ≈ 4.669201.\n\nFeigenbaum universality refers to the observation that the ratio of the difference between consecutive bifurcation points in the logistic map converges to the Feigenbaum constant as the bifurcation points become more and more closely spaced.\n\nTo find the parameter value r at which the logistic map displays Feigenbaum universality, we need to find the onset of chaos, which is the value of r at which the bifurcation diagram becomes fully chaotic. This value is known as the accumulation point and is approximately equal to r ≈ 3.56995.\n\nSo, the Feigenbaum constant δ is approximately 4.669201, and the parameter value r at which the logistic map displays Feigenbaum universality is approximately 3.56995."
