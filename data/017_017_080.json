    "message_2": "There are three non-isomorphic groups of order 30: the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, and a non-abelian group of order 30, which we will denote as G.\n\nProof:\n\nLet G be a group of order 30. Since 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, by the Sylow theorems, G has Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups. Let P2, P3, and P5 denote the orders of these subgroups, respectively.\n\n1. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, P5, must divide 6 (30/5) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, P5 can only be 1 or 6. If P5 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, P3, must divide 10 (30/3) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, P3 can only be 1 or 10. If P3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\n2. If G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then their product is a subgroup of G, which has order 15 (by the Chinese Remainder Theorem). Since there is only one group of order 15 (the cyclic group C15), this subgroup is isomorphic to C15. Then, G is a semidirect product of this normal subgroup of order 15 and a subgroup of order 2. This gives us the dihedral group D15.\n\n3. If G does not have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, then P5 = 6. Similarly, if G does not have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then P3 = 10. In this case, G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. However, this would mean that G has at least 6×4 + 10×2 = 40 elements, which is a contradiction since G has only 30 elements. Therefore, G must have either a normal Sylow 5-subgroup or a normal Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\n4. If G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup but not a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then P3 = 10. In this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 6. The product of these subgroups has order 30, so G is a semidirect product of a normal subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 6. This gives us the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\n5. If G is a cyclic group of order 30, then it is isomorphic to C30.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 30 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30. There are three non-isomorphic groups of order 30."
