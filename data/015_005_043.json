    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which can be written as:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nTo find the equilibrium solution, we need to find the values of x, y, and z for which the derivatives dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt are all equal to zero. Given the parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7, we have:\n\n0 = -y - z\n0 = x + 0.2y\n0 = 0.2 + z(x - 5.7)\n\nNow, we solve this system of equations:\n\nFrom the second equation, we have x = -0.2y. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n0 = -y - z\n\nNow, substituting x = -0.2y into the third equation:\n\n0 = 0.2 + z(-0.2y - 5.7)\n0 = 0.2 - 0.2yz - 5.7z\n\nSince z ≠ 0, we can divide by z:\n\n0 = (0.2 - 0.2yz - 5.7z) / z\n0 = 0.2/z - 0.2y - 5.7\n\nNow, we have:\n\n0.2/z = 5.7 + 0.2y\n\nFrom the first equation, we know that z = -y. Substituting this, we get:\n\n0.2/-y = 5.7 + 0.2y\n-0.2/y = 5.7 + 0.2y\n\nMultiplying both sides by -y:\n\n0.2 = -5.7y - 0.2y^2\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n0.2y^2 + 5.7y - 0.2 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nHere, A = 0.2, B = 5.7, and C = -0.2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (-5.7 ± √(5.7^2 - 4 * 0.2 * -0.2)) / (2 * 0.2)\n\ny ≈ -0.03547, y ≈ 5.63547\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding x and z values:\n\nFor y ≈ -0.03547:\nx = -0.2 * -0.03547 ≈ 0.007094\nz = -(-0.03547) ≈ 0.03547\n\nFor y ≈ 5.63547:\nx = -0.2 * 5.63547 ≈ -1.127094\nz = -(5.63547) ≈ -5.63547\n\nSo, there are two equilibrium solutions for the given Rössler system with parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7:\n\n1. (x, y, z) ≈ (0.007094, -0.03547, 0.03547)\n2. (x, y, z) ≈ (-1.127094, 5.63547, -5.63547)"
