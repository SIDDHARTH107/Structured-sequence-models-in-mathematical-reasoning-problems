    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that increases in length with each iteration. The length of the curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (Multiplier)^n\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, the initial length is 1 unit (the length of the base of the starting triangle), and the multiplier is 3/2, as each iteration replaces each line segment with three segments, each half the length of the original.\n\nSo, for the 6th iteration, the total length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is:\n\nLength = 1 * (3/2)^6\nLength = 1 * (729/64)\nLength = 729/64 â‰ˆ 11.390625 units"
