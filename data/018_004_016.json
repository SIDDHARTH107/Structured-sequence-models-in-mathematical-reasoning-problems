    "message_2": "The complement of a set B with respect to a universal set A, denoted as B', is the set of all elements in A that are not in B.\n\nGiven the universal set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and set B = {2, 4, 6}, we can find the complement of set B as follows:\n\nB' = {x ∈ A | x ∉ B}\n\nComparing the elements of set A and set B, we can see that the elements 1, 3, and 5 are not in set B. Therefore, the complement of set B is:\n\nB' = {1, 3, 5}\n\nTo verify that the complement of set B is unique, we need to show that there is no other set that can be the complement of set B with respect to set A. Since set A is the universal set, any other subset of A that is not equal to B' would either contain elements from set B or not contain some elements from B'. In either case, it would not be a complement of set B.\n\nThus, the complement of set B is unique, and it is B' = {1, 3, 5}."
