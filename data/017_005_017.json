    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the order of G is 125 = 5^3. Let n_5 denote the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup, which is [G : P] = 125/5^3 = 1.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nFrom these two conditions, we can conclude that n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P of G, and by the Sylow theorems, P is normal in G. Since the order of P is 5^2 = 25, P is a group of order 25.\n\nNow, let x be an element of G that is not in P. Then, the order of x must be 5, as the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group. Consider the subgroup H generated by x, i.e., H = ⟨x⟩. Since the order of x is 5, the order of H is also 5.\n\nNow, we claim that G is the internal direct product of P and H. To show this, we need to verify the following conditions:\n\n1. G = PH, i.e., every element of G can be written as a product of an element in P and an element in H.\n2. P ∩ H = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nFor the first condition, note that since P is normal in G and the order of H is 5, which is prime, we have that the order of PH is |P||H|/|P ∩ H| = 25 * 5 = 125. Since G has 125 elements, we must have G = PH.\n\nFor the second condition, suppose there is an element g in P ∩ H. Then, the order of g divides both the order of P (which is 25) and the order of H (which is 5). Since 5 is prime and does not divide 25, the only possibility is that the order of g is 1, i.e., g = e. Thus, P ∩ H = {e}.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, G is the internal direct product of P and H. Since P is a group of order 25 and H is a cyclic group of order 5, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
