    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n```\n| 1  1  1 | 6\n| 2 -1  3 | 5\n| 3 -1  4 | 7\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1:\n```\n| 1  1  1 |  6\n| 0 -3  1 | -7\n| 3 -1  4 |  7\n```\n\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1:\n```\n| 1  1  1 |  6\n| 0 -3  1 | -7\n| 0 -4  1 | -11\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - (4/3) * R2:\n```\n| 1  1  1 |  6\n| 0 -3  1 | -7\n| 0  0 -1 |  1\n```\n\nNow, the augmented matrix is in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\n-1 * z = 1 => z = -1\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\n-3 * y + 1 * z = -7 => -3 * y - 1 = -7 => y = 2\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nx + y + z = 6 => x + 2 - 1 = 6 => x = 5\n\nSo, the solution for the system of equations is x = 5, y = 2, and z = -1."
