    "message_1": "In a certain class, there are 8 girls, 4 boys, and 3 teachers. If the students are divided into three groups for a project, each with at least one teacher and an equal number of girls and boys, how many ways are there to form the groups?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 4 boys and 8 girls, each group must have an equal number of boys and girls. Therefore, each group will have 1 boy and 2 girls. There are 3 teachers, and each group must have at least one teacher. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Assign the teachers to the groups: There are 3 teachers and 3 groups, so there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to assign the teachers to the groups, which is 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\n2. Assign the boys to the groups: There are 4 boys, and each group must have 1 boy. We can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to assign the boys to the groups: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 4 and k = 1. So, C(4, 1) = 4! / (1!(4-1)!) = 4! / (1!3!) = 4.\n\n3. Assign the girls to the groups: There are 8 girls, and each group must have 2 girls. We can use the combination formula again to find the number of ways to assign the girls to the groups. In this case, n = 8 and k = 2. So, C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = 28.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to assign the teachers, boys, and girls to the groups: 6 (teachers) × 4 (boys) × 28 (girls) = 672 ways to form the groups."
