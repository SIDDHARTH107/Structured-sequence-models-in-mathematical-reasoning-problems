    "message_1": "In a game of Battle of the Sexes, a man and a woman must choose one of two options: go to a football game or go to a ballet. The man's preferences are (football, ballet) and the woman's preferences are (ballet, football). The utility payoffs are (2,1) for going to a football game together, (1,2) for going to a ballet together, and (0,0) if each goes alone. If both players independently select their preferred activity, what is the expected outcome of the game in terms of utility?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected outcome of the game in terms of utility, we need to consider the probabilities of each possible outcome. Since both players independently select their preferred activity, there are four possible outcomes:\n\n1. Both choose football (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n2. Both choose ballet (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n3. Man chooses football, woman chooses ballet (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n4. Man chooses ballet, woman chooses football (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected utility for each outcome:\n\n1. Both choose football: (2,1) * 0.25 = (0.5, 0.25)\n2. Both choose ballet: (1,2) * 0.25 = (0.25, 0.5)\n3. Man chooses football, woman chooses ballet: (0,0) * 0.25 = (0, 0)\n4. Man chooses ballet, woman chooses football: (0,0) * 0.25 = (0, 0)\n\nFinally, we sum up the expected utilities for each outcome:\n\nExpected utility = (0.5, 0.25) + (0.25, 0.5) + (0, 0) + (0, 0) = (0.75, 0.75)\n\nSo, the expected outcome of the game in terms of utility is (0.75, 0.75)."
