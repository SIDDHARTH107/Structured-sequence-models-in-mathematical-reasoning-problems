    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least two heads in three tosses of a fair coin, we can use complementary probability. This means we will find the probability of the complementary event (getting less than two heads) and subtract it from 1.\n\nThere are two complementary events: getting exactly one head and getting no heads at all.\n\n1. Probability of getting exactly one head (HTT, THT, TTH):\n(1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2) * 3 = 3/8\n\n2. Probability of getting no heads at all (TTT):\n(1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2) = 1/8\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two complementary events:\n3/8 + 1/8 = 4/8 = 1/2\n\nFinally, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of getting at least two heads:\n1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least two heads in three tosses of a fair coin is 1/2 or 50%."
