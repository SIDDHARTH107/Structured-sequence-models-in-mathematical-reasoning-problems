    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is the largest connected region in the set, and it has a shape similar to a heart. The area of the main cardioid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * (5/4)\n\nArea ≈ 1.9635\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is approximately 1.96 square units."
