    "message_2": "To partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets, we use the Bell number, denoted as B(n). The Bell number counts the number of different ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.\n\nFor a set of 7 elements, we want to find B(7). The first few Bell numbers are:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\nB(6) = 203\n\nTo find B(7), we can use the Bell triangle, which is constructed as follows:\n\n1. The first number in each row is the last number in the previous row.\n2. Each subsequent number in a row is the sum of the number to the left and the number above it.\n\nThe first few rows of the Bell triangle are:\n\n1\n1  2\n2  3  5\n5  7 10 15\n15 20 27 37 52\n52 67 87 114 151 203\n\nContinuing this process, we can find the next row:\n\n203 255 322 386 451 504 607\n\nSo, B(7) = 877. There are 877 ways to partition a set of 7 elements into non-empty subsets."
