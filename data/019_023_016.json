In the second flock, there are 70 sheep, and 63 of them face north. What is the probability that the next black sheep in the third flock, which has 100 sheep, will face north?",
    "message_2": "Since it is given that the black sheep in each flock always faces north, the probability that the next black sheep in the third flock will face north is 100%."
