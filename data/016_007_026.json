    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed.\n\nFor a Menger sponge of order 3, we perform this process three times. Let's calculate the volume at each iteration:\n\n1. Initial cube (order 0): Volume = 1³ = 1 unit³\n\n2. First iteration (order 1): We remove 1/3 of the volume (the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube). So, the remaining volume is 2/3 of the initial volume. Volume = (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 unit³\n\n3. Second iteration (order 2): Each remaining cube from the first iteration is now divided into 27 smaller cubes, and we remove 1/3 of the volume again. Volume = (2/3) * (2/3) * 1 = 4/9 unit³\n\n4. Third iteration (order 3): Each remaining cube from the second iteration is now divided into 27 smaller cubes, and we remove 1/3 of the volume again. Volume = (2/3) * (4/9) * 1 = 8/27 unit³\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge of order 3 with a side length of 1 is 8/27 unit³."
