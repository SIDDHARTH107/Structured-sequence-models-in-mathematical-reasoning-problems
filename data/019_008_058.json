    "message_2": "To find the membership value of element x=11 in the fuzzy set A, we need to use the appropriate membership function. Since 10 < x ≤ 16, we will use the second membership function:\n\nμA(x) = (x-1)/(3+2x)\n\nNow, substitute x=11 into the equation:\n\nμA(11) = (11-1)/(3+2*11) = 10/(3+22) = 10/25 = 2/5 = 0.4\n\nSo, the membership value of element x=11 in the fuzzy set A is 0.4."
