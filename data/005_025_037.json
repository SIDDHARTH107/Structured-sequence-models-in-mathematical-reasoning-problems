    "message_1": "Suppose the weights of 50 students in a school are normally distributed with a mean of 60 kilograms and a standard deviation of 5 kilograms. What is the probability that a randomly selected student weighs more than 65 kilograms?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student weighs more than 65 kilograms, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize (65 kg in this case), μ is the mean (60 kg), and σ is the standard deviation (5 kg).\n\nz = (65 - 60) / 5\nz = 5 / 5\nz = 1\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can look up the probability in the standard normal distribution table. The table gives us the probability that a value is less than the given z-score. Since we want the probability that a student weighs more than 65 kg, we need to find the complement of the probability given by the table.\n\nThe probability for a z-score of 1 is 0.8413. This means that there is an 84.13% chance that a randomly selected student weighs less than 65 kg. To find the probability that a student weighs more than 65 kg, we subtract this value from 1:\n\nP(X > 65) = 1 - P(X < 65)\nP(X > 65) = 1 - 0.8413\nP(X > 65) = 0.1587\n\nSo, there is a 15.87% chance that a randomly selected student weighs more than 65 kilograms."
