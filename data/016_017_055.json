    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal curve that is created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The order of the curve refers to the number of times the folding process is repeated.\n\nFor each order, the total length of the curve is doubled. So, for an order 5 Heighway dragon curve, we need to double the length 5 times.\n\nIf the initial segment has a length of 1 unit, the total length of the order 5 Heighway dragon curve is:\n\n1 * 2^5 = 1 * 32 = 32 units."
