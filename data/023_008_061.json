    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n for the given function f(t) = t^2 - 2t on the interval -5 ≤ t ≤ 5, we will use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(t) dt] from -L to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(t) * cos(n * π * t / L) dt] from -L to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(t) * sin(n * π * t / L) dt] from -L to L\n\nHere, L = 5 since the interval is -5 ≤ t ≤ 5.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/5) * ∫[(t^2 - 2t) dt] from -5 to 5\na_0 = (1/5) * [(t^3/3 - t^2) from -5 to 5]\na_0 = (1/5) * [(125/3 - 25) - (-125/3 - 25)]\na_0 = (1/5) * (250/3)\na_0 = 50/3\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (2/5) * ∫[(t^2 - 2t) * cos(n * π * t / 5) dt] from -5 to 5\n\nIntegration by parts is needed here. Let u = t^2 - 2t and dv = cos(n * π * t / 5) dt. Then, du = (2t - 2) dt and v = (5/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = u*v - ∫v du\n\na_n = (2/5) * [(t^2 - 2t) * (5/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5) - ∫(5/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5) * (2t - 2) dt] from -5 to 5\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second part again by parts. Let u = 2t - 2 and dv = sin(n * π * t / 5) dt. Then, du = 2 dt and v = (-5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5).\n\na_n = (2/5) * [(t^2 - 2t) * (5/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5) - (2t - 2) * (-5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5) + ∫(-5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5) * 2 dt] from -5 to 5\n\na_n = (2/5) * [(t^2 - 2t) * (5/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5) + (2t - 2) * (5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5) + (10/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5)] from -5 to 5\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the a_n coefficient will be 0.\n\na_n = 0\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/5) * ∫[(t^2 - 2t) * sin(n * π * t / 5) dt] from -5 to 5\n\nWe will use integration by parts again, with the same u and dv as before:\n\nb_n = (2/5) * [(t^2 - 2t) * (-5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5) - ∫(-5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5) * (2t - 2) dt] from -5 to 5\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second part again by parts, using the same u and dv as before:\n\nb_n = (2/5) * [(t^2 - 2t) * (-5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5) + (2t - 2) * (5/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5) - ∫(5/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5) * 2 dt] from -5 to 5\n\nb_n = (2/5) * [(t^2 - 2t) * (-5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5) + (2t - 2) * (5/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * t / 5) - (10/(n * π)) * (-5/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * t / 5)] from -5 to 5\n\nSince cos(n * π) = 1 for even n and -1 for odd n, the b_n coefficient will be 0.\n\nb_n = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients for the given function f(t) = t^2 - 2t on the interval -5 ≤ t ≤ 5 are:\n\na_0 = 50/3\na_n = 0\nb_n = 0"
