The payoff matrix is as follows:\n\n```\n           | Player B swerves | Player B doesn't swerve\nPlayer A  |------------------|------------------------\nswerves   |  (2, 2)          |  (0, 5)\n          |                  |\ndoesn't   |  (5, 0)          |  (-1, -1)\n```\n\nIf Player A decides not to swerve, what is the best strategy for Player B to win the game?",
    "message_2": "If Player A decides not to swerve, Player B has two options: swerve or not swerve. Let's analyze the payoffs for Player B in each case:\n\n1. If Player B swerves: The payoff for Player B is 0 (from the matrix, when Player A doesn't swerve and Player B swerves, the payoff is (5, 0)).\n2. If Player B doesn't swerve: The payoff for Player B is -1 (from the matrix, when both Player A and Player B don't swerve, the payoff is (-1, -1)).\n\nComparing the payoffs, Player B gets a higher payoff (0) when they swerve compared to when they don't swerve (-1). Therefore, the best strategy for Player B to win the game when Player A decides not to swerve is for Player B to swerve."
