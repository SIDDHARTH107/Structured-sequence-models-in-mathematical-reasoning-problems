    "message_2": "Let's first compute the first De Rham cohomology group $H^1(M)$ using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the cover $\\{U, V\\}$. Since $U$ and $V$ are homeomorphic to an open disc, their first De Rham cohomology groups are trivial, i.e., $H^1(U) = H^1(V) = 0$. The intersection $U \\cap V$ is homeomorphic to an annulus, so its first De Rham cohomology group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $H^1(U \\cap V) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence for De Rham cohomology is given by:\n\n$$\\cdots \\to H^0(M) \\to H^0(U) \\oplus H^0(V) \\to H^0(U \\cap V) \\to H^1(M) \\to H^1(U) \\oplus H^1(V) \\to H^1(U \\cap V) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nSince $H^1(U) = H^1(V) = 0$, the sequence becomes:\n\n$$\\cdots \\to H^0(M) \\to H^0(U) \\oplus H^0(V) \\to H^0(U \\cap V) \\to H^1(M) \\to 0 \\to H^1(U \\cap V) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nNow, $H^0(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, $H^0(U) \\oplus H^0(V) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, and $H^0(U \\cap V) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The maps between these groups are given by the restrictions and inclusions of the constant functions, so the maps are surjective. Thus, we have:\n\n$$0 \\to H^1(M) \\to \\mathbb{R} \\to 0$$\n\nThis implies that $H^1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, let $\\alpha$ be a closed 1-form on $M$ which is exact on $U$ and $V$. Since $\\alpha$ is exact on $U$ and $V$, there exist functions $f_U$ and $f_V$ on $U$ and $V$, respectively, such that $\\alpha = df_U$ on $U$ and $\\alpha = df_V$ on $V$. On the intersection $U \\cap V$, we have $df_U = df_V$, so $d(f_U - f_V) = 0$. This means that $f_U - f_V$ is a constant function on $U \\cap V$, say $c$.\n\nNow, we can define a function $f$ on $M$ by:\n\n$$f(x) = \\begin{cases} f_U(x) & \\text{if } x \\in U \\\\ f_V(x) + c & \\text{if } x \\in V \\end{cases}$$\n\nThis function is well-defined and continuous on $M$, since on the intersection $U \\cap V$, we have $f_U(x) = f_V(x) + c$. Moreover, $f$ is a primitive of $\\alpha$, since $df = df_U$ on $U$ and $df = df_V$ on $V$, and thus $df = \\alpha$ on $M$."
