    "message_1": "Let's say a math student is trying to classify a certain 2-dimensional manifold with non-empty boundary. The boundary of this manifold is a circle with radius 3. The student wants to calculate the number of connected components of this manifold. \n\nWhat is the number of connected components of this 2-dimensional manifold with non-empty boundary whose boundary is a circle with radius 3?",
    "message_2": "Since the boundary of the 2-dimensional manifold is a circle with radius 3, the manifold must be a disk (a region bounded by the circle). A disk is a connected space, meaning that any two points in the disk can be connected by a continuous path within the disk.\n\nTherefore, the number of connected components of this 2-dimensional manifold is 1."
