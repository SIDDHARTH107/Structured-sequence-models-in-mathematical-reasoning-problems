    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. So, we can rewrite the system as:\n\n1) 2x + 3y = 7\n2) 2(2x + 3y) = 2(7)\n\nNow, let's simplify the second equation:\n\n2) 4x + 6y = 14\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line. Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions, and the solutions are any point on the line 2x + 3y = 7."
