    "message_1": "A family is planning a road trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. The probability of having no traffic on the road is 0.6, and the probability of having a flat tire during the trip is 0.2. What is the probability that the family will arrive at their destination without encountering any traffic or experiencing a flat tire?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probability of each event. \n\nThe probability of having no traffic is 0.6. The probability of not having a flat tire is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (since there's a 0.2 chance of having a flat tire, there's a 0.8 chance of not having one).\n\nNow, we multiply the probabilities:\n\n0.6 (no traffic) * 0.8 (no flat tire) = 0.48\n\nSo, the probability that the family will arrive at their destination without encountering any traffic or experiencing a flat tire is 0.48 or 48%."
