    "message_1": "Suppose you use a substitution cipher to encrypt a message with a one-to-one mapping of each letter to a different letter of the alphabet. If the letter 'p' is encrypted to the letter 'k', what letter is the letter 'k' encrypted to?",
    "message_2": "Since it is a one-to-one mapping, the letter 'k' cannot be encrypted to the letter 'p' as 'p' is already mapped to 'k'. To determine the letter that 'k' is encrypted to, we would need more information about the specific substitution cipher being used. There are many possible substitution ciphers, and without more information, we cannot determine the exact mapping for the letter 'k'."
