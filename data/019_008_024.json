    "message_1": "A company produces widgets that have a weight between 50 and 110 grams. The company has a quality control system that sorts widgets into three categories: good, acceptable, and defective. The weight criteria for each category are:\n\n- Good widgets weigh between 70 and 90 grams\n- Acceptable widgets weigh between 60 and 100 grams\n- Defective widgets weigh less than 60 grams or more than 100 grams\n\nUsing fuzzy logic, calculate the degree of membership of a 75-gram widget in the categories of good, acceptable, and defective.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the degree of membership using fuzzy logic, we need to determine the membership functions for each category. We will use linear membership functions for simplicity.\n\n1. Good widgets (70-90 grams):\nFor a 75-gram widget, it falls within the range of good widgets. The membership function for good widgets can be defined as:\nμ_good(x) = (x - 70) / (90 - 70) for 70 <= x <= 90\nμ_good(75) = (75 - 70) / (90 - 70) = 5 / 20 = 0.25\n\n2. Acceptable widgets (60-100 grams):\nFor a 75-gram widget, it falls within the range of acceptable widgets. The membership function for acceptable widgets can be defined as:\nμ_acceptable(x) = (x - 60) / (100 - 60) for 60 <= x <= 100\nμ_acceptable(75) = (75 - 60) / (100 - 60) = 15 / 40 = 0.375\n\n3. Defective widgets (less than 60 grams or more than 100 grams):\nFor a 75-gram widget, it does not fall within the range of defective widgets. Therefore, the degree of membership for defective widgets is 0.\n\nSo, the degree of membership of a 75-gram widget in the categories of good, acceptable, and defective are:\n- Good: 0.25\n- Acceptable: 0.375\n- Defective: 0"
