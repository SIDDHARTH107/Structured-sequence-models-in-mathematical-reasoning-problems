    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron of level 3 is constructed by recursively removing the central tetrahedron from a larger tetrahedron and repeating the process for the remaining four tetrahedra. \n\nFor a level 1 Sierpinski tetrahedron, we remove the central tetrahedron from the original tetrahedron, leaving 4 smaller tetrahedra. Each of these smaller tetrahedra has a side length of half the original side length (in this case, 2 units).\n\nFor a level 2 Sierpinski tetrahedron, we repeat the process for each of the 4 smaller tetrahedra from level 1. This results in 4 * 4 = 16 even smaller tetrahedra, each with a side length of half the previous level (in this case, 1 unit).\n\nFinally, for a level 3 Sierpinski tetrahedron, we repeat the process for each of the 16 smaller tetrahedra from level 2. This results in 16 * 4 = 64 smallest tetrahedra, each with a side length of half the previous level (in this case, 0.5 units).\n\nSo, to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron of level 3, we need 64 smaller tetrahedra of side length 0.5 units."
