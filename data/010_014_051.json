Suppose that the cup product map $H^i(X,\\mathbb{Z}) \\times H^j(X,\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^{i+j}(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ is non-zero for all i and j. Determine the cohomology ring $H^*(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of generators and relations.",
    "message_2": "Since $H^k(X,\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ for all k, we can choose a generator $x_k \\in H^k(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ for each k. The cohomology ring $H^*(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ is then generated by these elements $x_k$.\n\nNow, let's consider the cup product structure. Since the cup product map is non-zero for all i and j, we have that $x_i \\smile x_j \\neq 0$ for all i and j. In particular, this means that $x_i \\smile x_j = n_{ij} x_{i+j}$ for some non-zero integer $n_{ij}$. \n\nTo determine the relations in the cohomology ring, we can use the graded commutativity property of the cup product, which states that for any two cohomology classes $a$ and $b$ with degrees $|a|$ and $|b|$, we have $a \\smile b = (-1)^{|a||b|} b \\smile a$. Applying this property to our generators, we get:\n\n$x_i \\smile x_j = (-1)^{ij} x_j \\smile x_i$.\n\nSince $x_i \\smile x_j = n_{ij} x_{i+j}$ and $x_j \\smile x_i = n_{ji} x_{i+j}$, we have:\n\n$n_{ij} x_{i+j} = (-1)^{ij} n_{ji} x_{i+j}$.\n\nSince $x_{i+j}$ is a generator and non-zero, we can cancel it from both sides of the equation, obtaining:\n\n$n_{ij} = (-1)^{ij} n_{ji}$.\n\nThis equation gives us the relations between the coefficients of the cup products in the cohomology ring.\n\nIn summary, the cohomology ring $H^*(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by elements $x_k$ with $H^k(X,\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and the relations are given by the graded commutativity property:\n\n$x_i \\smile x_j = (-1)^{ij} x_j \\smile x_i$,\n\nwith $x_i \\smile x_j = n_{ij} x_{i+j}$ for some non-zero integers $n_{ij}$ satisfying $n_{ij} = (-1)^{ij} n_{ji}$."
