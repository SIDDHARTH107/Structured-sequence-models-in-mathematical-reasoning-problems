    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum independent set, we need to find the largest set of vertices that do not share an edge.\n\nIn this graph, one possible maximum independent set is {1, 4, 5, 9}. There are no edges between any of these vertices, and it is not possible to add any more vertices to this set without creating an edge between two vertices in the set.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set of vertices in this graph is 4."
