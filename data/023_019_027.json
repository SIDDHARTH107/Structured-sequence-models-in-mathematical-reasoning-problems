    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze its frequency response by finding the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t). The Fourier transform of h(t) is given by:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[h(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nSince h(t) = e^(-t)u(t), we have:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[e^(-t)u(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nThe unit step function u(t) is equal to 1 for t ≥ 0 and 0 for t < 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[e^(-t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[e^(-t(1 + jω))] dt, from 0 to ∞.\n\nThis is an integral of the form ∫[e^(-at)] dt, where a = 1 + jω. We can solve this integral using integration by parts or by recognizing it as a Laplace transform:\n\nH(ω) = [-e^(-t(1 + jω)) / (1 + jω)] evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limits:\n\nAs t → ∞, e^(-t(1 + jω)) → 0, so the upper limit evaluates to 0.\n\nAt t = 0, e^(-t(1 + jω)) = 1, so the lower limit evaluates to -1 / (1 + jω).\n\nThus, H(ω) = 1 / (1 + jω).\n\nNow, we need to check if the system is stable. A system is stable if its impulse response is absolutely integrable, which means:\n\n∫|h(t)| dt < ∞, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nIn our case, h(t) = e^(-t)u(t), so we have:\n\n∫|e^(-t)u(t)| dt, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nSince u(t) is 0 for t < 0, the integral becomes:\n\n∫|e^(-t)| dt, from 0 to ∞.\n\nThis integral evaluates to:\n\n[-e^(-t)] evaluated from 0 to ∞ = 1.\n\nSince the integral converges to a finite value, the system is stable."
