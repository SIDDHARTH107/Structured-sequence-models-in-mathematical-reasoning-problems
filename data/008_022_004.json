    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n[ 2  3 | 8 ]\n[ 4  6.99 | 15.98 ]\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix. We'll start by eliminating the 4 in the second row, first column. To do this, we'll subtract twice the first row from the second row:\n\n[ 2  3 | 8 ]\n[ 0  0.99 | -0.02 ]\n\nNow, we have the following system of equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n0.99y = -0.02\n\nTo solve for y, we'll divide the second equation by 0.99:\n\ny = -0.02 / 0.99\ny ≈ -0.0202\n\nNow, we'll substitute this value of y back into the first equation to solve for x:\n\n2x + 3(-0.0202) = 8\n2x - 0.0606 ≈ 8\n2x ≈ 8.0606\nx ≈ 4.0303\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x ≈ 4.0303 and y ≈ -0.0202.\n\nNow, let's determine if the matrix is ill-conditioned. A matrix is considered ill-conditioned if it is nearly singular, meaning that its determinant is close to zero. This can lead to large errors in the solution when using numerical methods. To check this, we'll calculate the determinant of the matrix:\n\n|A| = | 2  3 |\n         | 4  6.99 |\n\n|A| = (2)(6.99) - (3)(4)\n|A| = 13.98 - 12\n|A| = 1.98\n\nSince the determinant is not close to zero, the matrix is not ill-conditioned."
