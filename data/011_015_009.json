What is the minimum number of guests we need to add to the party to ensure that either there are 3 guests wearing shirts of the same color, or there are 3 guests all wearing hats?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes and n+1 pigeons, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this case, the pigeonholes are the shirt colors and the hat-wearing condition. We have 6 different shirt colors and 2 hat-wearing conditions (wearing a hat or not wearing a hat). So, we have a total of 6 * 2 = 12 pigeonholes.\n\nTo ensure that either there are 3 guests wearing shirts of the same color or there are 3 guests all wearing hats, we need to add enough guests to the party so that one of these pigeonholes contains 3 guests.\n\nIf we add 1 guest, there will be a total of 7 guests. In the worst-case scenario, each guest has a different shirt color and hat-wearing condition, so we still don't have 3 guests with the same shirt color or 3 guests all wearing hats.\n\nIf we add 2 more guests (for a total of 8 guests), we still cannot guarantee that there are 3 guests with the same shirt color or 3 guests all wearing hats. In the worst-case scenario, we could have 2 guests with each shirt color and 4 guests wearing hats and 4 guests not wearing hats.\n\nHowever, if we add 3 more guests (for a total of 9 guests), we can guarantee that either there are 3 guests wearing shirts of the same color or there are 3 guests all wearing hats. In the worst-case scenario, we would have 2 guests with each shirt color and 5 guests wearing hats and 4 guests not wearing hats. In this case, there must be at least one shirt color with 3 guests wearing it, or there must be at least 3 guests all wearing hats.\n\nSo, the minimum number of guests we need to add to the party to ensure that either there are 3 guests wearing shirts of the same color or there are 3 guests all wearing hats is 3."
