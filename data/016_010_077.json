    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the spaces between three mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. It is formed by an infinite number of circles, so it is not possible to give an exact number of circles that can fit inside the gasket. However, we can discuss the properties and behavior of the circles within the gasket.\n\nThe process of creating an Apollonian gasket starts with three mutually tangent circles, which form a curvilinear triangle. Inside this triangle, a new circle is drawn, tangent to all three initial circles. This process is then repeated for each of the three new curvilinear triangles formed by the new circle and the initial circles, and so on, ad infinitum.\n\nThe circles in the Apollonian gasket can be described using Descartes' Circle Theorem, which relates the curvatures (reciprocal of the radius) of four mutually tangent circles. If the curvatures of three tangent circles are k1, k2, and k3, and the curvature of the fourth circle tangent to all three is k4, then:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 Â± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)) = k4\n\nIn the case of the Apollonian gasket, the initial three circles have curvatures k1, k2, and k3, and the first circle inside the triangle has curvature k4. The process of adding circles continues infinitely, so the total number of circles in the gasket is infinite."
