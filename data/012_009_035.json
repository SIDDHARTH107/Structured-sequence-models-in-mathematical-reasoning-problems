    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to draw such a graph. Here is one possible graph with the given degree sequence:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.\n2. Connect the vertices as follows:\n   - A is connected to B, C, and D (degree 3)\n   - B is connected to A, C, and E (degree 3)\n   - C is connected to A, B, and F (degree 3)\n   - D is connected to A, E, and G (degree 3)\n   - E is connected to B, D, and F (degree 3)\n   - F is connected to C, E, and G (degree 3)\n   - G is connected to D, F, and H (degree 3)\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in the degree sequence provided. The correct degree sequence for this graph is [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. It is not possible to create a graph with the degree sequence [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4] because the sum of the degrees in the sequence is not even (the sum is 20, which is even, but the sequence is incorrect). In a simple graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices must be even, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices."
