    "message_2": "Actually, there is a mistake in the question. There is no non-abelian group of order 9. All groups of order 9 are abelian. Let me explain why.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G (denoted by n_3) must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 9, the only possible value for n_3 is 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup in G, which is normal (since it is unique).\n\nLet H be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since the order of H is 3, H is cyclic, and we can write H = <a> for some a in G with order 3. Now, since the order of G is 9, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 9. Thus, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nSince a has order 3, let's consider an element b in G that is not in H (i.e., b is not in <a>). The order of b must be either 3 or 9. If the order of b is 9, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 9, which is abelian.\n\nIf the order of b is 3, let's consider the element c = ab. Since b is not in H, the subgroup generated by a and b, denoted by <a, b>, must have order greater than 3. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of <a, b> must divide 9, so the order of <a, b> must be 9. Since G has order 9, this means that G = <a, b>.\n\nNow, let's show that G is abelian in this case. Since a and b both have order 3, we have a^3 = b^3 = e (where e is the identity element of G). Then, we have:\n\n(ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = ee = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the element aba^(-1)b^(-1). We have:\n\naba^(-1)b^(-1) = ab(a^2b^2) = a(ba^2)b^2 = (ab)^3 = e.\n\nThis implies that ab = ba, which means that G is abelian.\n\nIn both cases, G is an abelian group. Therefore, there is no non-abelian group of order 9."
