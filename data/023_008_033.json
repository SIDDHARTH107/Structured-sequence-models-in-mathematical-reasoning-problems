    "message_2": "Since the function f(x) = x(1-x) is non-periodic and defined on the interval [0,1], we cannot find the Fourier coefficients in the traditional sense. However, we can find the Fourier series representation of the function by expanding it in terms of sine and cosine functions. This is known as the Fourier sine series or Fourier cosine series, depending on the choice of basis functions.\n\nFor this problem, we will use the Fourier sine series, as the function f(x) is odd with respect to the midpoint of the interval, x = 0.5. The Fourier sine series representation of a function f(x) on the interval [0, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑(B_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere B_n is the nth Fourier sine coefficient, given by:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx) from 0 to L\n\nFor our function f(x) = x(1-x) on the interval [0,1], we have L = 1. Thus, the Fourier sine series representation is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(B_n * sin(nπx))\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we need to compute the integral:\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫(x(1-x) * sin(nπx) dx) from 0 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let u = x(1-x) and dv = sin(nπx) dx. Then, du = (1-2x) dx and v = -cos(nπx)/(nπ).\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n∫(u dv) = uv - ∫(v du)\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-x(1-x)cos(nπx)/(nπ)] - ∫[-cos(nπx)/(nπ) * (1-2x) dx]) from 0 to 1\n\nNow, let u' = 1-2x and dv' = -cos(nπx)/(nπ) dx. Then, du' = -2 dx and v' = sin(nπx)/(n²π²).\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-x(1-x)cos(nπx)/(nπ)] + [(1-2x)sin(nπx)/(n²π²)] - ∫[-2sin(nπx)/(n²π²) dx]) from 0 to 1\n\nNow, integrate the remaining term:\n\n∫[-2sin(nπx)/(n²π²) dx] = [-2cos(nπx)/(n³π³)] from 0 to 1\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-x(1-x)cos(nπx)/(nπ)] + [(1-2x)sin(nπx)/(n²π²)] + [2cos(nπx)/(n³π³)]) from 0 to 1\n\nEvaluate the expression at the limits:\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-cos(nπ)/(nπ)] + [sin(nπ)/(n²π²)] + [2/(n³π³)] - [2cos(nπ)/(n³π³)])\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-(-1)^n/(nπ)] + [0] + [2/(n³π³)] - [2(-1)^n/(n³π³)])\n\nSimplifying:\n\nB_n = 2 * ([(-1)^n - 1]/(nπ) + [1 - (-1)^n]/(n³π³))\n\nThe Fourier sine series representation of f(x) = x(1-x) on the interval [0,1] is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(B_n * sin(nπx))\n\nf(x) = ∑{2 * ([(-1)^n - 1]/(nπ) + [1 - (-1)^n]/(n³π³)) * sin(nπx)}"
