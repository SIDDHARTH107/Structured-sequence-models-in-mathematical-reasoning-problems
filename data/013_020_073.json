Each player's payoff is equal to 2 multiplied by the difference between their chosen number and the number that is two-thirds of the simple average of all three chosen numbers. What is the optimal strategy for each player, and what is their corresponding payoff in equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for each player, we need to analyze the game using game theory. Let's denote the chosen numbers of the three players as x, y, and z. The simple average of these numbers is (x+y+z)/3, and two-thirds of this average is (2/3)((x+y+z)/3) = (x+y+z)/2.\n\nThe payoff functions for each player are as follows:\n\nPayoff for Player 1: 2 * |x - (y+z)/2|\nPayoff for Player 2: 2 * |y - (x+z)/2|\nPayoff for Player 3: 2 * |z - (x+y)/2|\n\nTo find the optimal strategy, we need to find the Nash equilibrium of this game, which is a situation where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where all players choose the same number, say k. In this case, the average is k, and two-thirds of the average is (2/3)k. The payoffs for each player would be:\n\nPayoff for Player 1: 2 * |k - (2/3)k| = 2 * (1/3)k = (2/3)k\nPayoff for Player 2: 2 * |k - (2/3)k| = (2/3)k\nPayoff for Player 3: 2 * |k - (2/3)k| = (2/3)k\n\nIn this case, all players have the same payoff, and no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy. However, this is not the only Nash equilibrium.\n\nAnother Nash equilibrium can be found by considering the case where two players choose the same number, and the third player chooses a different number. Without loss of generality, let's assume that x = y and z is different. In this case, the average is (2x+z)/3, and two-thirds of the average is (4x+2z)/6 = (2x+z)/3.\n\nThe payoffs for each player are:\n\nPayoff for Player 1: 2 * |x - (2x+z)/3| = 2 * |(x-2z)/3|\nPayoff for Player 2: 2 * |y - (2y+z)/3| = 2 * |(y-2z)/3|\nPayoff for Player 3: 2 * |z - (x+y)/2| = 2 * |(2z-x-y)/2| = |2z-x-y|\n\nIn this case, Player 1 and Player 2 have the same payoff, and Player 3 has a different payoff. If Player 3 chooses z such that their payoff is equal to the payoff of Player 1 and Player 2, then no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy. This condition is satisfied when:\n\n|(2z-x-y)/2| = |(x-2z)/3|\n\nSolving for z, we get:\n\nz = (5x+y)/7\n\nSo, the optimal strategy for Player 3 is to choose z such that it satisfies the above equation. The corresponding payoffs for each player in this equilibrium are:\n\nPayoff for Player 1: 2 * |(x-2z)/3| = 2 * |(x-2(5x+y)/7)/3| = 2 * |(3x-5y)/21|\nPayoff for Player 2: 2 * |(y-2z)/3| = 2 * |(y-2(5x+y)/7)/3| = 2 * |(3y-5x)/21|\nPayoff for Player 3: |2z-x-y| = |2(5x+y)/7 - x - y| = |(3x-3y)/7|\n\nIn summary, the optimal strategy for each player depends on the choices of the other players. In the Nash equilibrium where all players choose the same number, their payoffs are equal to (2/3) times their chosen number. In the Nash equilibrium where two players choose the same number and the third player chooses a different number, the optimal strategy for the third player is to choose a number that satisfies the equation z = (5x+y)/7, and the corresponding payoffs for each player are given by the expressions above."
