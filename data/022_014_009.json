    "message_2": "To find the harmonic conjugate of $h(x, y)$, we first need to find the function $g(x, y)$ such that $f(x, y) = h(x, y) + ig(x, y)$ is an analytic function. Analytic functions satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}$.\n\nFirst, let's find the real part of $(x + iy)^3$:\n\n$(x + iy)^3 = (x^3 + 3ix^2y - 3xy^2 - iy^3) = (x^3 - 3xy^2) + i(3x^2y - y^3)$.\n\nSo, $h(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$. Now, we need to find the partial derivatives of $h(x, y)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = -6xy$.\n\nNow, we need to find a function $g(x, y)$ such that:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 6xy$.\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$g(x, y) = \\int (3x^2 - 3y^2) dy = 3x^2y - y^3 + C(x)$,\n\nwhere $C(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nNow, we differentiate this expression with respect to $x$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 6xy + C'(x)$.\n\nComparing this to the second Cauchy-Riemann equation, we have:\n\n$6xy + C'(x) = 6xy \\Rightarrow C'(x) = 0$.\n\nThis means that $C(x)$ is a constant. Since the harmonic conjugate is unique up to a constant, we can set $C(x) = 0$. Thus, the harmonic conjugate of $h(x, y)$ is:\n\n$g(x, y) = 3x^2y - y^3$."
