    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess x₀ = [1; 1].\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current guess x to get a new vector y.\n3. Normalize y to get the next guess x.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the desired number of iterations.\n5. The dominant eigenvalue is the ratio of the elements in the final y vector, and the dominant eigenvector is the final x vector.\n\nLet's perform 5 iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nA = [2 1; 1 2]\nx₀ = [1; 1]\n\ny₁ = A * x₀ = [2*1 + 1*1; 1*1 + 2*1] = [3; 3]\nx₁ = y₁ / ||y₁|| = [3/√18; 3/√18] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nIteration 2:\ny₂ = A * x₁ = [2*(1/√2) + 1*(1/√2); 1*(1/√2) + 2*(1/√2)] = [3/√2; 3/√2]\nx₂ = y₂ / ||y₂|| = [(3/√2)/3; (3/√2)/3] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nIteration 3:\ny₃ = A * x₂ = [2*(1/√2) + 1*(1/√2); 1*(1/√2) + 2*(1/√2)] = [3/√2; 3/√2]\nx₃ = y₃ / ||y₃|| = [(3/√2)/3; (3/√2)/3] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nIteration 4:\ny₄ = A * x₃ = [2*(1/√2) + 1*(1/√2); 1*(1/√2) + 2*(1/√2)] = [3/√2; 3/√2]\nx₄ = y₄ / ||y₄|| = [(3/√2)/3; (3/√2)/3] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nIteration 5:\ny₅ = A * x₄ = [2*(1/√2) + 1*(1/√2); 1*(1/√2) + 2*(1/√2)] = [3/√2; 3/√2]\nx₅ = y₅ / ||y₅|| = [(3/√2)/3; (3/√2)/3] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the eigenvector x₅ has not changed, so we can assume it has converged to the dominant eigenvector. Now, let's find the dominant eigenvalue:\n\nDominant eigenvalue = (y₅₁ / x₅₁) = (3/√2) / (1/√2) = 3\n\nThus, the dominant eigenvalue is 3, and the dominant eigenvector is [1/√2; 1/√2]. Rounded to 3 decimal places, the eigenvector is [0.707; 0.707]."
