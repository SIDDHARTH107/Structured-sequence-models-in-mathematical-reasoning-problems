    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. \n\nLike terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers. In this expression, the like terms are the terms with x and the terms with y.\n\nFirst, let's combine the terms with x:\n\n3x - 5x + 4x = (3 - 5 + 4)x = 2x\n\nNow, let's combine the terms with y:\n\n2y - y - 3y = (2 - 1 - 3)y = -2y\n\nNow that we have combined the like terms, we can rewrite the simplified expression:\n\n2x - 2y"
