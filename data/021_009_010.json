    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient at any point x.\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 - 4x + 3)/dx = 4x - 4\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent update rule to find the approximate solution after 5 iterations:\n\nx_new = x_old - step_size * f'(x_old)\n\nWe are given an initial guess of x=0 and a step size of 0.1. Let's perform 5 iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_old = 0\nx_new = 0 - 0.1 * (4*0 - 4) = 0 + 0.4 = 0.4\n\nIteration 2:\nx_old = 0.4\nx_new = 0.4 - 0.1 * (4*0.4 - 4) = 0.4 - 0.1 * (0.4) = 0.4 - 0.04 = 0.36\n\nIteration 3:\nx_old = 0.36\nx_new = 0.36 - 0.1 * (4*0.36 - 4) = 0.36 - 0.1 * (0.08) = 0.36 - 0.008 = 0.352\n\nIteration 4:\nx_old = 0.352\nx_new = 0.352 - 0.1 * (4*0.352 - 4) = 0.352 - 0.1 * (0.016) = 0.352 - 0.0016 = 0.3504\n\nIteration 5:\nx_old = 0.3504\nx_new = 0.3504 - 0.1 * (4*0.3504 - 4) = 0.3504 - 0.1 * (0.0032) = 0.3504 - 0.00032 = 0.35008\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the approximate solution is x â‰ˆ 0.35008."
