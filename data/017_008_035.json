    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 8, and let x be a non-identity element of G. The order of the centralizer of x, denoted by |C_G(x)|, is the number of elements in G that commute with x. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, we have |G| = |C_G(x)| * |Orb(x)|, where |Orb(x)| is the size of the orbit of x under the action of conjugation by elements of G. Since |G| = 8, the possible orders of the centralizer of x are 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n\n1. If |C_G(x)| = 1, then x commutes only with the identity element, which means x has order 8. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.\n\n2. If |C_G(x)| = 2, then x commutes with itself and the identity element. Since x is not the identity, the order of x must be 2, 4, or 8. If the order of x is 8, then G is isomorphic to C8. If the order of x is 4, then G has an element of order 4, and by Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4. If the order of x is 2, then G has an element of order 2, and by Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 4. In this case, G is also isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n\n3. If |C_G(x)| = 4, then x commutes with three other elements besides the identity element. Since x is not the identity, the order of x must be 2, 4, or 8. If the order of x is 8, then G is isomorphic to C8. If the order of x is 4, then G has an element of order 4, and by Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4. If the order of x is 2, then G has an element of order 2, and by Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 4. In this case, G is also isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n\n4. If |C_G(x)| = 8, then x commutes with all elements of G, which means G is abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, by analyzing the structure of the centralizers of non-identity elements in a group of order 8, we have shown that such a group is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4."
