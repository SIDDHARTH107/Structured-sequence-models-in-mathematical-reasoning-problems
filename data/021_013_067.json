The production process can be optimized by minimizing the total time needed to produce all products. The factory has 5 machines and 10 products to produce. Each product can be produced in any order and on any machine, but some machines are better suited for some products. The time needed to produce each product on each machine is given in the table below:\n\n|          | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 | Machine 5 |\n| -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |\n| Product 1| 6         | 2         | 10        | 8         | 3         |\n| Product 2| 4         | 4         | 1         | 3         | 4         |\n| Product 3| 5         | 9         | 5         | 5         | 5         |\n| Product 4| 2         | 7         | 2         | 5         | 5         |\n| Product 5| 8         | 2         | 1         | 10        | 4         |\n| Product 6| 4         | 2         | 8         | 5         | 3         |\n| Product 7| 7         | 10        | 9         | 3         | 1         |\n| Product 8| 2         | 2         | 2         | 2         | 1         |\n| Product 9| 1         | 6         | 6         | 6         | 6         |\n| Product 10| 10        | 8         | 1         | 7         | 6         |\n\nUsing the simulated annealing optimization method, what is the optimal production schedule that minimizes the total production time?",
