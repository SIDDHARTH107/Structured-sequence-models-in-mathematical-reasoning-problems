    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to produce 10,000 units of a particular product. The total cost of producing each unit is given by the function C(x) = 0.1x^2 + 80x + 2000, where x is the number of units produced. The manufacturer can sell each unit for $200. \n\nWhat is the optimal production quantity for the manufacturer to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production quantity to maximize profits, we first need to find the profit function. The profit function is given by the difference between the revenue function and the cost function.\n\nLet R(x) be the revenue function, which is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units produced: R(x) = 200x.\n\nNow, let P(x) be the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function: P(x) = R(x) - C(x).\n\nSubstitute the given functions into the profit function:\nP(x) = (200x) - (0.1x^2 + 80x + 2000).\n\nSimplify the profit function:\nP(x) = 200x - 0.1x^2 - 80x - 2000\nP(x) = -0.1x^2 + 120x - 2000\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity, we need to find the maximum point of the profit function. Since the profit function is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, it will have a maximum point. The maximum point can be found using the vertex formula for a parabola:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn our profit function, a = -0.1 and b = 120. Plug these values into the vertex formula:\n\nx = -120 / (2 * -0.1)\nx = -120 / -0.2\nx = 600\n\nSo, the optimal production quantity to maximize profits is 600 units. Note that the manufacturer initially wanted to produce 10,000 units, but producing 600 units will actually maximize their profits."
