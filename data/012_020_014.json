    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph G is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of G, denoted Aut(G), is the set of all automorphisms of G. To find the automorphism group of G, we will look for all possible permutations of the vertices that preserve adjacency.\n\nFirst, let's label the vertices of G as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, and v7, corresponding to the rows and columns of the adjacency matrix A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the degrees of the vertices:\n- deg(v1) = 2\n- deg(v2) = 5\n- deg(v3) = 2\n- deg(v4) = 2\n- deg(v5) = 3\n- deg(v6) = 4\n- deg(v7) = 2\n\nSince an automorphism must preserve vertex degrees, we can see that v1, v3, v4, and v7 must be mapped to each other, and v2, v5, and v6 must be mapped to each other.\n\nNow, let's analyze the adjacency relations between the vertices. We can see that:\n- v1 is adjacent to v2 and v6\n- v3 is adjacent to v2 and v4\n- v4 is adjacent to v2 and v5\n- v7 is adjacent to v2 and v6\n\nSince an automorphism must preserve adjacency, we can see that v1 and v7 can be mapped to each other, and v3 and v4 can be mapped to each other.\n\nSimilarly, we can see that:\n- v2 is adjacent to all vertices except v3\n- v5 is adjacent to v2, v4, and v6\n- v6 is adjacent to v1, v2, v5, and v7\n\nSince an automorphism must preserve adjacency, we can see that v2, v5, and v6 must be mapped to each other.\n\nNow, we can list all possible automorphisms of G:\n1. Identity automorphism: (v1)(v2)(v3)(v4)(v5)(v6)(v7)\n2. (v1 v7)(v2 v5 v6)(v3 v4)\n3. (v1 v7)(v2 v6 v5)(v3 v4)\n\nThus, the automorphism group of G is Aut(G) = { (v1)(v2)(v3)(v4)(v5)(v6)(v7), (v1 v7)(v2 v5 v6)(v3 v4), (v1 v7)(v2 v6 v5)(v3 v4) }."
