    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal pattern created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to form a series of right angles. The length of the Dragon Curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (sqrt(2))^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after six iterations (n = 6).\n\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2))^6\nLength = 1 * 2^3\nLength = 1 * 8\nLength = 8\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon Curve after six iterations is 8."
