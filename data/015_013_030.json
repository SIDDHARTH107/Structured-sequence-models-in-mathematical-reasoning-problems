    "message_2": "We will calculate the value of x₅ by iterating the logistic equation 5 times, starting with x₀ = 0.4.\n\nx₁ = 3.8 * x₀ * (1 - x₀) = 3.8 * 0.4 * (1 - 0.4) = 3.8 * 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.912\n\nx₂ = 3.8 * x₁ * (1 - x₁) = 3.8 * 0.912 * (1 - 0.912) = 3.8 * 0.912 * 0.088 = 0.305792\n\nx₃ = 3.8 * x₂ * (1 - x₂) = 3.8 * 0.305792 * (1 - 0.305792) = 3.8 * 0.305792 * 0.694208 = 0.80879104\n\nx₄ = 3.8 * x₃ * (1 - x₃) = 3.8 * 0.80879104 * (1 - 0.80879104) = 3.8 * 0.80879104 * 0.19120896 = 0.5893039064\n\nx₅ = 3.8 * x₄ * (1 - x₄) = 3.8 * 0.5893039064 * (1 - 0.5893039064) = 3.8 * 0.5893039064 * 0.4106960936 = 0.9200815723\n\nAfter five iterations, the value of x₅ is approximately 0.9200815723."
