    "message_2": "To determine if the set S is compact, we need to check if it is both closed and bounded.\n\nFirst, let's check if S is bounded. Since n ∈ N (natural numbers), we know that n ≥ 1. Therefore, 1/n ≤ 1. Also, as n increases, 1/n approaches 0. So, the set S is bounded between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, let's check if S is closed. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points. The limit point of a sequence is a point such that every neighborhood of the point contains infinitely many points of the sequence.\n\nConsider the sequence {1/n} as n approaches infinity. The limit of this sequence is 0, as 1/n → 0 when n → ∞. However, 0 is not an element of the set S, since n cannot be infinity in the natural numbers. Therefore, the set S does not contain all its limit points and is not closed.\n\nSince S is bounded but not closed, we conclude that the set S is not compact."
