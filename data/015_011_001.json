(Assuming standard gravitational acceleration and neglecting air resistance.)",
    "message_2": "A double pendulum system is a chaotic system, and its behavior is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Analytically determining the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum is a complex task and typically requires numerical simulations to approximate the solution.\n\nHowever, we can provide a rough estimate of the maximum angle by considering the conservation of energy in the system. The total mechanical energy of the system is conserved, which includes the potential energy and the kinetic energy of both pendulums.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the two pendulums as θ1 and θ2, and their lengths as L1 and L2. The initial angles are θ1_initial = θ2_initial = 30°. The initial potential energy of the system is given by:\n\nPE_initial = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_initial)))\n\nSince the initial angular velocities are both zero, the initial kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is equal to the initial potential energy:\n\nE_total = PE_initial\n\nNow, let's consider the situation when the second pendulum reaches its maximum angle, θ2_max. At this point, the second pendulum will momentarily have zero angular velocity, so its kinetic energy will be zero. The potential energy of the system at this point is:\n\nPE_max = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_max)))\n\nBy conservation of energy, we have:\n\nE_total = PE_max\n\nPE_initial = PE_max\n\nm * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_initial))) = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_max)))\n\nSince we are interested in the maximum angle of the second pendulum, we can rearrange the equation to solve for θ2_max:\n\nL2 * (1 - cos(θ2_max)) = L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_initial)) - L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max))\n\n1 - cos(θ2_max) = (1 - cos(30°)) + 2 * (1 - cos(30°)) - (1 - cos(θ1_max))\n\ncos(θ2_max) = 1 - 3 * (1 - cos(30°)) + (1 - cos(θ1_max))\n\nNow, we need to estimate θ1_max. Since the first pendulum has a length of 1 meter and the second pendulum has a length of 2 meters, it is reasonable to assume that the first pendulum will not swing as high as the second pendulum. Therefore, we can approximate θ1_max ≈ θ1_initial = 30°.\n\ncos(θ2_max) ≈ 1 - 3 * (1 - cos(30°)) + (1 - cos(30°))\n\nθ2_max ≈ arccos(1 - 2 * (1 - cos(30°)))\n\nθ2_max ≈ arccos(1 - 2 * (1 - √3/2))\n\nθ2_max ≈ arccos(1 - (2 - √3))\n\nθ2_max ≈ arccos(√3 - 1)\n\nθ2_max ≈ 48.19°\n\nThis is a rough estimate of the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum in the given double pendulum system. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the actual maximum angle may be different due to the chaotic nature of the double pendulum system."
