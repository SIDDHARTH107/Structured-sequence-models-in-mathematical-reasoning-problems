    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly removing smaller triangles from an initial equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of triangles in the 8th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = Initial triangles × (Multiplier)^(Iteration - 1)\n\nIn this case, the initial number of triangles is 1 (a single equilateral triangle), the multiplier is 4, and the iteration is 8.\n\nTotal triangles = 1 × 4^(8 - 1) = 1 × 4^7 = 1 × 16384 = 16384\n\nSo, there are 16,384 triangles in the 8th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid."
