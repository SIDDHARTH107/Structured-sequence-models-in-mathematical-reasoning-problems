    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of f(z) = z^3 - 2z + 1 along the circle |z-2|=3 in the complex plane using Cauchy's theorem, we first need to check if f(z) is analytic within and on the contour. Since f(z) is a polynomial, it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane.\n\nCauchy's theorem states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed contour is zero. Therefore, the integral of f(z) along the circle |z-2|=3 is:\n\nâˆ®[z^3 - 2z + 1] dz = 0"
