    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Catalan numbers, we first need to understand the concept of Catalan numbers. Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics, including counting certain types of lattice paths, the number of ways to arrange parentheses in a valid sequence, and the number of ways to triangulate a polygon.\n\nThe nth Catalan number can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n) = (2n!)/((n+1)!n!)\n\nNow, let's apply this concept to the problem. We have 8 benches and 4 people, so there are 5 \"gaps\" between the people where no one can sit. We can think of these gaps as \"open\" and \"closed\" parentheses, with the people sitting in the \"closed\" parentheses. This means we can use the Catalan numbers to count the number of ways to arrange the parentheses (and thus the people) so that no two people sit next to each other.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the 4th Catalan number, since there are 4 people:\n\nC(4) = (1/(4+1)) * (2*4 choose 4) = (1/5) * (8!)/((4+1)!4!)\nC(4) = (1/5) * (8!)/((5)!4!)\nC(4) = (1/5) * (40320)/(120*24)\nC(4) = (1/5) * (3360)\nC(4) = 672\n\nSo there are 672 ways for the 4 people to sit on the 8 benches so that no two people sit next to each other."
