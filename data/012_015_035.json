    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph G is connected or not, we will use the fact that a graph with n vertices is connected if and only if it has at least n-1 edges and the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn our case, we have n = 9 vertices, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is n-1 = 8 edges. Since our graph has 12 edges, which is greater than the minimum required, it is possible for the graph to be connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of the degrees of all vertices. Since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices, the sum of the degrees of all vertices should be equal to 2 * 12 = 24.\n\nLet's assume that the graph G is connected. In this case, we can construct a spanning tree of G, which is a connected subgraph that includes all vertices and has no cycles. A spanning tree with 9 vertices will have 9-1 = 8 edges.\n\nNow, let's remove the 8 edges of the spanning tree from the graph G. We are left with 12 - 8 = 4 edges. Since the graph is connected, these 4 edges must connect pairs of vertices that are already connected in the spanning tree. This means that adding these 4 edges will create cycles in the graph.\n\nHowever, adding 4 edges to a graph with 9 vertices can create at most 4 cycles. This is because each cycle requires at least 3 vertices, and we have only 9 vertices in total. Therefore, the maximum number of cycles that can be created by adding 4 edges is 4.\n\nSince we have shown that it is possible for the graph G to be connected and have 12 edges, we can conclude that the graph G is connected."
