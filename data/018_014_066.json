    "message_1": "Consider two sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. Find the following Cartesian products and their complements:  \n\n1. A x B \n2. (A' x B') \n3. (A x B)' \n\nThen, verify whether the Cartesian product of A and B is distributive over complement or not.",
    "message_2": "1. A x B:\nThe Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, A x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\n2. (A' x B'):\nTo find the complement of A and B, we first need to define a universal set U for both A and B. Let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} for simplicity. Then, A' = {4, 5, 6, 7} and B' = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}. Now, we can find the Cartesian product (A' x B') = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 7)}.\n\n3. (A x B)':\nThe complement of A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) in U x U that are not in A x B. So, (A x B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7)}.\n\nNow, let's verify whether the Cartesian product of A and B is distributive over complement or not. For this, we need to check if (A x B)' = (A' x B').\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that (A x B)' â‰  (A' x B'). There are elements in (A x B)' that are not in (A' x B') and vice versa. For example, (1, 1) is in (A x B)' but not in (A' x B'), and (4, 1) is in (A' x B') but not in (A x B)'.\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of A and B is not distributive over complement."
