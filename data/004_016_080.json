    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the instantaneous rate of change (derivative) at c is equal to the average rate of change over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet's denote the position function of the car as s(t), where s is the distance traveled and t is the time. The average speed of the car is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, which is:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time) = 200 km / 4 hours = 50 km/h\n\nNow, we need to find a point where the car's instantaneous speed (the derivative of the position function, ds/dt) is equal to its average speed (50 km/h).\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 4) such that:\n\n(ds/dt)(c) = (s(4) - s(0)) / (4 - 0)\n\nSince we know the average speed is 50 km/h, we can write:\n\n(ds/dt)(c) = 50\n\nWe don't have the exact function s(t), but we know that there exists a point c in the interval (0, 4) where the car's instantaneous speed is equal to its average speed, which is 50 km/h."
