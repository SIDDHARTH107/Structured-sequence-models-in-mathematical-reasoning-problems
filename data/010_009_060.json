    "message_2": "We can use Euler's formula for planar graphs to solve this problem. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have F = 14 (the number of triangular faces). Each triangular face has 3 edges, but since each edge is shared by two triangles, we have E = (14 * 3) / 2 = 21 edges.\n\nNow we can plug these values into Euler's formula:\n\nV - 21 + 14 = 2\nV - 7 = 2\nV = 9\n\nSo the minimum number of vertices of S is 9."
