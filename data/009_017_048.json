    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P(0, 3, 4) due to the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a distance r is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire is parallel to the x-axis, we can write the differential length vector as dl = dx * î, where î is the unit vector along the x-axis. The position vector r from a point on the wire (x, 0, 0) to point P(0, 3, 4) is given by:\n\nr = -xî + 3ĵ + 4k̂\n\nNow, we can find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (dx * î) x (-xî + 3ĵ + 4k̂) = -3dx * k̂\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = √((-x)^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) = √(x^2 + 25)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (-3dx * k̂)) / (x^2 + 25)^(3/2)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at point P, we need to integrate dB along the wire from x = -10m to x = 10m:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (-3dx * k̂)) / (x^2 + 25)^(3/2) from -10 to 10\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (-3k̂) / 4π) * ∫(dx) / (x^2 + 25)^(3/2) from -10 to 10\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet x = 5 * tan(θ), then dx = 5 * sec^2(θ) * dθ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (-3k̂) / 4π) * ∫(5 * sec^2(θ) * dθ) / (25 * tan^2(θ) + 25)^(3/2) from θ1 to θ2\n\nwhere θ1 = arctan(-10/5) and θ2 = arctan(10/5)\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (-3k̂) / 4π) * ∫(dθ) / (sec^2(θ))^(3/2) from θ1 to θ2\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (-3k̂) / 4π) * ∫(cos^2(θ) * dθ) from θ1 to θ2\n\nNow, we can use the double-angle formula for cos(2θ) = 2cos^2(θ) - 1:\n\ncos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ)) / 2\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (-3k̂) / 8π) * ∫(1 + cos(2θ)) * dθ from θ1 to θ2\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (-3k̂) / 8π) * [θ + (1/2) * sin(2θ)] from θ1 to θ2\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of θ1 and θ2:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (-3k̂) / 8π) * [(θ2 - θ1) + (1/2) * (sin(2θ2) - sin(2θ1))]\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5A * (-3k̂) / 8π) * [(arctan(2) - arctan(-2)) + (1/2) * (sin(2 * arctan(2)) - sin(2 * arctan(-2)))]\n\nB ≈ (-6 × 10^(-7) T * k̂) * [2 * arctan(2) + 0.3902]\n\nB ≈ -1.47 × 10^(-6) T * k̂\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P(0, 3, 4) due to the wire is approximately -1.47 × 10^(-6) T in the negative z-direction."
