    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 50cm and radius 5cm is initially at a temperature of 100℃. One end of the rod is suddenly exposed to a constant heat source of 200℃, while the other end is kept at a constant temperature of 50℃. Assume that the rod is perfectly insulated, except for the two ends. Find the temperature profile of the rod as a function of time using the Fourier transform method.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the Fourier transform method. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nWe will first find the steady-state solution, which is the temperature profile when the system reaches equilibrium. In this case, the temperature will not change with time, so ∂T(x,t) / ∂t = 0. The steady-state solution is given by:\n\nT(x) = A * x + B\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we have:\n\nT(0) = 200℃\nT(50) = 50℃\n\nSolving for A and B, we get:\n\nA = -3℃/cm\nB = 200℃\n\nSo the steady-state solution is:\n\nT(x) = -3x + 200\n\nNow, we will find the transient solution, which is the temperature profile that changes with time. We will use the Fourier transform method to solve the heat equation. Let's define the Fourier transform of T(x,t) as:\n\nT_hat(k,t) = ∫ T(x,t) * e^(-ikx) dx\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the heat equation, we get:\n\n∂T_hat(k,t) / ∂t = -αk²T_hat(k,t)\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\nT_hat(k,t) = T_hat0(k) * e^(-αk²t)\n\nwhere T_hat0(k) is the initial Fourier transform of the temperature profile. To find T_hat0(k), we need to take the Fourier transform of the initial temperature profile, which is a constant 100℃:\n\nT_hat0(k) = ∫ 100 * e^(-ikx) dx = 100 * (δ(k) - δ(k+2π/L))\n\nwhere δ(k) is the Dirac delta function and L is the length of the rod (50 cm).\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of T_hat(k,t) to get the transient solution:\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) ∫ T_hat(k,t) * e^(ikx) dk\n\nPlugging in the expression for T_hat(k,t), we get:\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) ∫ 100 * (δ(k) - δ(k+2π/L)) * e^(-αk²t) * e^(ikx) dk\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nT(x,t) = 100 - (100/L) * ∑ (1/n) * sin(nπx/L) * e^(-αn²π²t/L²)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all positive integers n.\n\nFinally, the total temperature profile is the sum of the steady-state and transient solutions:\n\nT(x,t) = -3x + 200 + 100 - (100/L) * ∑ (1/n) * sin(nπx/L) * e^(-αn²π²t/L²)\n\nThis equation gives the temperature profile of the rod as a function of position x and time t. Note that as t → ∞, the transient solution goes to zero, and we are left with the steady-state solution."
