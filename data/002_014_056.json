    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\nThe three pairs of faces have dimensions:\n1. Length x Width (8 cm x 5 cm)\n2. Length x Height (8 cm x 3 cm)\n3. Width x Height (5 cm x 3 cm)\n\nNow, we find the area of each pair of faces and multiply by 2 (since there are two of each):\n\n1. 8 cm x 5 cm = 40 cm² (two faces)\n2. 8 cm x 3 cm = 24 cm² (two faces)\n3. 5 cm x 3 cm = 15 cm² (two faces)\n\nNow, we add the areas of all six faces together:\n\n(40 cm² x 2) + (24 cm² x 2) + (15 cm² x 2) = 80 cm² + 48 cm² + 30 cm² = 158 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 158 cm²."
