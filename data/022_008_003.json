    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use Liouville's theorem and Cauchy's integral formula.\n\nLiouville's theorem states that if a function g(z) is entire and bounded, then g(z) is a constant function.\n\nCauchy's integral formula states that for an entire function g(z) and a closed curve Γ in the complex plane,\n\ng^(n)(z) = (n! / 2πi) ∫(Γ) (g(ζ) / (ζ - z)^(n+1)) dζ\n\nwhere g^(n)(z) is the nth derivative of g(z).\n\nNow, let's consider the function g(z) = e^(-z^2) f(z). We know that f(z) is entire, and e^(-z^2) is also entire, so their product g(z) is entire.\n\nWe are given that |f(z)| ≤ e^(|z|^2) for all z. Therefore, we have:\n\n|g(z)| = |e^(-z^2) f(z)| ≤ |e^(-z^2) e^(z^2)| = 1\n\nThis means that g(z) is entire and bounded. By Liouville's theorem, g(z) must be a constant function, say g(z) = C.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nf(z) = e^(z^2) g(z) = C e^(z^2)\n\nLet's differentiate f(z) with respect to z:\n\nf'(z) = 2zCe^(z^2)\n\nAnd differentiate once more:\n\nf''(z) = 2Ce^(z^2) + 4z^2Ce^(z^2) = 2C(1 + 2z^2)e^(z^2)\n\nNow, let's consider the function h(z) = f(z) - f''(z)/2. We have:\n\nh(z) = f(z) - f''(z)/2 = Ce^(z^2) - C(1 + 2z^2)e^(z^2)/2 = C(1 - z^2)e^(z^2)\n\nNotice that h(z) is entire, and:\n\n|h(z)| = |C(1 - z^2)e^(z^2)| ≤ |C(1 - z^2)e^(z^2)|\n\nAs |z| goes to infinity, |h(z)| goes to 0. Therefore, h(z) is entire and bounded. By Liouville's theorem, h(z) must be a constant function, say h(z) = D.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nf(z) = h(z) + f''(z)/2 = D + 2C(1 + 2z^2)e^(z^2)/2 = D + C(1 + 2z^2)e^(z^2)\n\nSince f(z) is entire, it can be represented as a power series:\n\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + ...\n\nHowever, we have just shown that f(z) = D + C(1 + 2z^2)e^(z^2), which is a polynomial of degree at most 2. Therefore, all the coefficients a_n for n > 2 must be zero, and f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2."
