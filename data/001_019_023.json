    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 3| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 3 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can simply remove the absolute value sign:\n2x + 3 = 7\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n2x = 7 - 3\n2x = 4\nx = 4/2\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 2x + 3 is negative\nIn this case, we need to change the sign of the expression inside the absolute value:\n-(2x + 3) = 7\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n-2x - 3 = 7\n-2x = 7 + 3\n-2x = 10\nx = 10/(-2)\nx = -5\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 2 and x = -5."
