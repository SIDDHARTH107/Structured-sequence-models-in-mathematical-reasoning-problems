Each iteration involves dividing each cube into 27 smaller cubes.",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of cubes in a Menger sponge at level 4 iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal cubes = (20^n)\n\nwhere n is the iteration level.\n\nFor level 4 iteration:\n\nTotal cubes = (20^4) = 160,000 cubes"
