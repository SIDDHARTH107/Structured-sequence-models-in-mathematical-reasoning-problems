Let C be a curve with equation y^2=x^3+2x. \n\nWhat is the dimension of the space of all first-order deformations of C in M_1? \n\n(Hint: The space of first-order deformations can be described as the tangent space at C to the moduli space M_1 of elliptic curves.)",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of all first-order deformations of C in M_1, we need to compute the dimension of the tangent space at C to the moduli space M_1 of elliptic curves. \n\nThe curve C has genus g = 1, since it is an elliptic curve. The moduli space M_1 parametrizes isomorphism classes of elliptic curves, and it is well-known that M_1 is isomorphic to the quotient of the upper half-plane by the action of the modular group SL(2, Z). This space is one-dimensional, as it can be parametrized by the j-invariant.\n\nNow, we need to compute the tangent space at C to M_1. The tangent space can be identified with the space of first-order deformations of C, which are given by the infinitesimal variations of the curve's defining equation. In our case, the equation is y^2 = x^3 + 2x.\n\nConsider a first-order deformation of C given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + tε, where t is a complex parameter and ε is a small complex number. The deformation is nontrivial if the resulting curve is not isomorphic to C for any t.\n\nThe isomorphism classes of elliptic curves are determined by their j-invariant. The j-invariant of C is given by:\n\nj(C) = 1728 * (4 * 2^3) / (4 * 2^3 - 27 * 0^2) = 1728.\n\nNow, we need to compute the j-invariant of the deformed curve:\n\nj(C_t) = 1728 * (4 * (2 + tε)^3) / (4 * (2 + tε)^3 - 27 * 0^2) = 1728 * (1 + 12tε + O(ε^2)).\n\nThe deformed curve C_t is isomorphic to C if and only if j(C_t) = j(C). Expanding the expression for j(C_t), we see that the condition j(C_t) = j(C) is equivalent to:\n\n1728 * (1 + 12tε) = 1728.\n\nThis equation holds if and only if t = 0. Therefore, the deformation is nontrivial for any t ≠ 0, and the space of first-order deformations of C is one-dimensional.\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of all first-order deformations of C in M_1 is 1."
