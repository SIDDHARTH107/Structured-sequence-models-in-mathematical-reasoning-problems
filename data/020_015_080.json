    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular field be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter P is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the perimeter is 100 meters, we have:\n\n100 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that maximize the area A of the rectangular field. The area A is given by the formula:\n\nA = L * W\n\nWe can rearrange the perimeter formula to solve for W:\n\nW = (100 - 2L) / 2 = 50 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the area formula:\n\nA = L * (50 - L)\n\nA = 50L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dL = 50 - 2L = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n2L = 50\nL = 25\n\nNow, substitute L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 50 - 25 = 25\n\nSo, the dimensions that maximize the area of the rectangular field are 25 meters by 25 meters."
