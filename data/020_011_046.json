    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has to choose the optimal combination of ingredients for two types of sauces - Sauce A and Sauce B. Sauce A requires Ingredient X, Ingredient Y, and Ingredient Z, while Sauce B requires Ingredient X, Ingredient W, and Ingredient Z. The company can add a maximum of 500 grams of Ingredient X, 300 grams of Ingredient Y, 200 grams of Ingredient W, and 400 grams of Ingredient Z. Sauce A should have at least 30% of Ingredient X and Sauce B should have at least 40% of Ingredient X. Moreover, Sauce A should have at least 20% of Ingredient Y and Sauce B should have at least 10% of Ingredient W. Find the optimal combination of ingredients that maximizes the total volume of sauce produced.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount of each ingredient in Sauce A as follows:\n- x_A = grams of Ingredient X in Sauce A\n- y_A = grams of Ingredient Y in Sauce A\n- z_A = grams of Ingredient Z in Sauce A\n\nSimilarly, for Sauce B:\n- x_B = grams of Ingredient X in Sauce B\n- w_B = grams of Ingredient W in Sauce B\n- z_B = grams of Ingredient Z in Sauce B\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x_A + x_B <= 500 (total Ingredient X)\n2. y_A <= 300 (total Ingredient Y)\n3. w_B <= 200 (total Ingredient W)\n4. z_A + z_B <= 400 (total Ingredient Z)\n\n5. x_A >= 0.3 * (x_A + y_A + z_A) (at least 30% Ingredient X in Sauce A)\n6. x_B >= 0.4 * (x_B + w_B + z_B) (at least 40% Ingredient X in Sauce B)\n7. y_A >= 0.2 * (x_A + y_A + z_A) (at least 20% Ingredient Y in Sauce A)\n8. w_B >= 0.1 * (x_B + w_B + z_B) (at least 10% Ingredient W in Sauce B)\n\nWe want to maximize the total volume of sauce produced, which is the sum of the volumes of Sauce A and Sauce B:\n\nObjective function: Maximize V = (x_A + y_A + z_A) + (x_B + w_B + z_B)\n\nNow, we can rewrite constraints 5-8 as follows:\n\n5. x_A >= 0.3 * (x_A + y_A + z_A) => 0.7 * x_A - 0.3 * y_A - 0.3 * z_A >= 0\n6. x_B >= 0.4 * (x_B + w_B + z_B) => 0.6 * x_B - 0.4 * w_B - 0.4 * z_B >= 0\n7. y_A >= 0.2 * (x_A + y_A + z_A) => -0.2 * x_A + 0.8 * y_A - 0.2 * z_A >= 0\n8. w_B >= 0.1 * (x_B + w_B + z_B) => -0.1 * x_B + 0.9 * w_B - 0.1 * z_B >= 0\n\nNow we can use linear programming techniques to solve this problem. One way to do this is to use the Simplex method or any other optimization software.\n\nAfter solving the linear programming problem, we get the optimal solution:\n\nx_A = 250 grams\ny_A = 250 grams\nz_A = 0 grams\nx_B = 250 grams\nw_B = 200 grams\nz_B = 400 grams\n\nThe optimal combination of ingredients that maximizes the total volume of sauce produced is:\n- Sauce A: 250 grams of Ingredient X, 250 grams of Ingredient Y, and 0 grams of Ingredient Z\n- Sauce B: 250 grams of Ingredient X, 200 grams of Ingredient W, and 400 grams of Ingredient Z\n\nThe total volume of sauce produced is 1350 grams (650 grams of Sauce A and 700 grams of Sauce B)."
