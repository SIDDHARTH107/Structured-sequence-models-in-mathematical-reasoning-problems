    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which is used to model various physical and chemical processes. The system is defined as follows:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nHere, a, b, and c are parameters that determine the behavior of the system.\n\nThe chaotic behavior of the Rössler system depends on the values of these parameters. For the system to exhibit chaotic behavior, the parameter 'a' should be greater than a certain threshold value. The minimum value of 'a' for which the Rössler system displays chaotic behavior is approximately a = 0.1, with b = 0.1 and c = 14.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the chaotic behavior of the Rössler system is not only dependent on the value of 'a' but also on the values of 'b' and 'c'. Different combinations of these parameters can lead to different types of behavior, including periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic."
