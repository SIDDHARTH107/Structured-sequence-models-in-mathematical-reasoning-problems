    "message_1": "A drugstore has three types of pain relievers, A, B, and C. The probability of a customer switching from type A to type B is 0.3, the probability of a switch from type B to type C is 0.2, and the probability of a switch from type C to type A is 0.4. If today the store has 20 customers who choose type A, 5 who choose type B, and 30 who choose type C, what is the expected number of customers who will choose type A after three days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use a Markov chain model. We will create a transition matrix P, where each entry P(i, j) represents the probability of a customer switching from type i to type j. Then, we will raise this matrix to the power of 3 to find the probabilities after three days. Finally, we will multiply the initial state vector by the resulting matrix to find the expected number of customers who will choose type A after three days.\n\nFirst, let's create the transition matrix P:\n\nP = | 0.7  0.3  0.0 | (staying in A, switching from A to B, and switching from A to C)\n      | 0.0  0.8  0.2 | (switching from B to A, staying in B, and switching from B to C)\n      | 0.4  0.0  0.6 | (switching from C to A, switching from C to B, and staying in C)\n\nNow, let's raise the matrix P to the power of 3 to find the probabilities after three days:\n\nP^3 = | 0.7  0.3  0.0 |^3\n          | 0.0  0.8  0.2 |\n          | 0.4  0.0  0.6 |\n\nP^3 = | 0.646  0.198  0.156 |\n          | 0.144  0.656  0.200 |\n          | 0.456  0.144  0.400 |\n\nNow, let's create the initial state vector S:\n\nS = | 20 | (number of customers who choose type A)\n      |  5  | (number of customers who choose type B)\n      | 30 | (number of customers who choose type C)\n\nFinally, let's multiply the initial state vector S by the matrix P^3 to find the expected number of customers who will choose type A after three days:\n\nS * P^3 = | 20 | * | 0.646  0.198  0.156 |\n                 |  5  |   | 0.144  0.656  0.200 |\n                 | 30 |   | 0.456  0.144  0.400 |\n\nS * P^3 = | 20.92 | (expected number of customers who will choose type A after three days)\n                 |  6.98  |\n                 | 32.10 |\n\nSo, the expected number of customers who will choose type A after three days is approximately 20.92."
