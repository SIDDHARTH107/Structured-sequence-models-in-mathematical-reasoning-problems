    "message_2": "Let's denote Alice's private key as a, Bob's private key as b, Alice's public key as A, Bob's public key as B, the shared prime number as p, and the shared secret key as S.\n\nIn the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, we have the following relationships:\n\n1. A = g^a mod p\n2. B = g^b mod p\n3. S = A^b mod p = B^a mod p\n\nWe are given A = 13, p = 23, and S = 17. We need to find B.\n\nFirst, we need to find the primitive root g of p. For p = 23, the primitive root g = 5.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the relationships as:\n\n1. 13 = 5^a mod 23\n2. B = 5^b mod 23\n3. 17 = 13^b mod 23 = B^a mod 23\n\nWe need to find the value of a from the first equation:\n\n13 = 5^a mod 23\nBy trying different values of a, we find that a = 7 satisfies the equation:\n\n5^7 mod 23 = 13\n\nNow, we can use the third equation to find the value of b:\n\n17 = 13^b mod 23\nBy trying different values of b, we find that b = 10 satisfies the equation:\n\n13^10 mod 23 = 17\n\nNow that we have the value of b, we can find Bob's public key B using the second equation:\n\nB = 5^b mod 23\nB = 5^10 mod 23\nB = 20\n\nSo, Bob's public key is 20."
