    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, width of 3 cm, and height of 7 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length and width:\nArea_top/bottom = 5 cm * 3 cm = 15 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, the total area for the top and bottom faces is:\n2 * 15 cm² = 30 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length and height:\nArea_front/back = 5 cm * 7 cm = 35 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, the total area for the front and back faces is:\n2 * 35 cm² = 70 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the width and height:\nArea_left/right = 3 cm * 7 cm = 21 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, the total area for the left and right faces is:\n2 * 21 cm² = 42 cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together to find the total surface area:\nTotal_surface_area = 30 cm² + 70 cm² + 42 cm² = 142 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 142 cm²."
