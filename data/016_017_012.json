    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be found using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 8th iteration. So, we have:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^8)\n\nLength = 1 * 256\n\nLength = 256 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 8th iteration is 256 units."
