    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of lamps, A and B. Each type requires 3 units of raw material M1 and 2 units of raw material M2. The factory has access to 180 units of M1 and 120 units of M2. Lamp A sells for $12 and requires 4 hours of labor to produce, while Lamp B sells for $15 and requires 6 hours of labor. What is the maximum profit the factory can earn if all lamps produced are sold?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of lamps of type A produced and y be the number of lamps of type B produced.\n\nThe constraints for the raw materials are:\n3x + 3y ≤ 180 (M1 constraint)\n2x + 2y ≤ 120 (M2 constraint)\n\nWe can simplify these constraints by dividing both sides by the common factors:\nx + y ≤ 60 (M1 constraint simplified)\nx + y ≤ 60 (M2 constraint simplified)\n\nSince both constraints are the same, we only need to consider one of them:\nx + y ≤ 60\n\nThe profit function is given by:\nP(x, y) = 12x + 15y\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) subject to the constraint x + y ≤ 60.\n\nSince both x and y are non-negative, we can consider the following cases:\n\n1) x = 0: In this case, y = 60, and the profit is P(0, 60) = 12(0) + 15(60) = $900.\n2) y = 0: In this case, x = 60, and the profit is P(60, 0) = 12(60) + 15(0) = $720.\n\nComparing the profits for both cases, we find that the maximum profit the factory can earn if all lamps produced are sold is $900, which is achieved by producing 60 lamps of type B and no lamps of type A."
