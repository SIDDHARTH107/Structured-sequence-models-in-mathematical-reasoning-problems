    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the particles' positions and velocities.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each particle.\n3. Update the personal best (pBest) and global best (gBest) positions.\n4. Update the particles' velocities and positions.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet's start with the initial particle positions x1 = 8 and x2 = 2.\n\n1. Initialize the particles' positions and velocities:\n\nParticle 1: position (x1) = 8, velocity (v1) = 0\nParticle 2: position (x2) = 2, velocity (v2) = 0\n\n2. Calculate the fitness of each particle:\n\nf(x1) = f(8) = 8^2 - 5*8 + 6 = 64 - 40 + 6 = 30\nf(x2) = f(2) = 2^2 - 5*2 + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0\n\n3. Update the personal best (pBest) and global best (gBest) positions:\n\npBest1 = 8, pBest2 = 2\ngBest = 2 (since f(x2) is the minimum)\n\n4. Update the particles' velocities and positions:\n\nWe will use the following PSO equations:\n\nv_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * r1 * (pBest_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * r2 * (gBest - x_i(t))\nx_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n\nwhere w is the inertia weight, c1 and c2 are the cognitive and social coefficients, r1 and r2 are random numbers between 0 and 1, and t is the iteration number.\n\nLet's assume w = 0.7, c1 = 2, and c2 = 2.\n\nFor Particle 1:\n\nr1 = 0.5, r2 = 0.3\nv1(1) = 0.7 * 0 + 2 * 0.5 * (8 - 8) + 2 * 0.3 * (2 - 8) = -3.6\nx1(1) = 8 + (-3.6) = 4.4\n\nFor Particle 2:\n\nr1 = 0.6, r2 = 0.4\nv2(1) = 0.7 * 0 + 2 * 0.6 * (2 - 2) + 2 * 0.4 * (2 - 2) = 0\nx2(1) = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met:\n\nWe can continue iterating through the PSO algorithm, updating the particles' velocities and positions, and checking for improvements in the fitness function. For this example, we'll stop after one iteration, but in practice, you would typically run the algorithm for a set number of iterations or until the change in gBest is below a certain threshold.\n\nAfter one iteration, we have the updated particle positions x1(1) = 4.4 and x2(1) = 2. The global best position is still gBest = 2, which corresponds to the minimum value of the function f(x) = 0."
