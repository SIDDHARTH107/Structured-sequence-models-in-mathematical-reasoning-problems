    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of tables: standard and deluxe. The material cost for each standard table is $100, and for each deluxe table is $200. The company has a total of $15,000 to spend on materials for the tables. The production time for each standard table is 2 hours and for each deluxe table is 5 hours. The company has a total of 60 hours of production time available for making the tables. If the profit per standard table is $50 and for each deluxe table is $100, how many of each type of table should the company produce to maximize its profit?\n\nWrite a system of linear equations, construct its matrix representation, and use matrix methods to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of standard tables and y be the number of deluxe tables.\n\nWe have two constraints: one for the material cost and one for the production time.\n\nMaterial cost constraint:\n100x + 200y ≤ 15000\n\nProduction time constraint:\n2x + 5y ≤ 60\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 100y.\n\nFirst, we'll write the system of linear inequalities:\n\n1. 100x + 200y ≤ 15000\n2. 2x + 5y ≤ 60\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll construct the matrix representation of the system:\n\n| 100  200 | | x | ≤ | 15000 |\n|   2    5 | | y | ≤ |    60 |\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we'll use the simplex method. First, we'll convert the inequalities into equalities by introducing slack variables s1 and s2:\n\n100x + 200y + s1 = 15000\n2x + 5y + s2 = 60\nx, y, s1, s2 ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll set up the initial simplex tableau:\n\n|  1   0  100  200  1  0  0 |\n|  0   1    2    5  0  1  0 |\n|  0   0  -50 -100  0  0  1 |\n\nNext, we'll perform the simplex method iterations:\n\n1.
