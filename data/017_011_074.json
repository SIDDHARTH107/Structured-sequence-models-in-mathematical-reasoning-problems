    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 12 is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let's first find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide the order of G (12) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide the order of G (12) and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup and one 2-Sylow subgroup, then both are normal in G. Let P be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup. Since P and Q are normal, their direct product PQ is also normal in G. Moreover, since |P| = 3 and |Q| = 4, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 12, which is the order of G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to C3 Ã— C4 = C12.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 1\nIf there are four 3-Sylow subgroups and one 2-Sylow subgroup, let Q be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup. Since |Q| = 4, Q is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If Q is isomorphic to C4, then G has an element of order 4. However, A4 is the only group of order 12 with no element of order 4. Thus, G must be isomorphic to A4 in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 3\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup and three 2-Sylow subgroups, let P be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since |P| = 3, P is isomorphic to C3. The group G acts on the set of left cosets of P by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S3. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of G contained in P. Since P is isomorphic to C3, its only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup and itself. If the kernel is trivial, then the homomorphism is injective, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S3. However, this is not possible since |G| = 12 and |S3| = 6. Thus, the kernel must be P itself. The image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S3 of order 4, which must be isomorphic to V4. Therefore, G is an extension of V4 by C3. The only such group of order 12 is D6, the dihedral group of order 12.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 12, it must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6."
