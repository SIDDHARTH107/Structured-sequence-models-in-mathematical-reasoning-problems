    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Let's analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 6.\nIf G has an element of order 6, let's call it a. Then G can be generated by a, i.e., G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 6, and we can define an isomorphism φ: G → C6 by φ(a^k) = k, for k = 0, 1, ..., 5. Since φ is a bijection and preserves the group operation, G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 6.\nIn this case, G must have elements of orders 2 and 3, since the identity element has order 1. Let b be an element of order 2 and c be an element of order 3. Then G contains the elements {e, b, c, c^2, bc, bc^2}. We claim that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nRecall that D3 is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle, and it can be represented as D3 = {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}, where r is a rotation by 120 degrees and s is a reflection. We can define an isomorphism φ: G → D3 as follows:\n\nφ(e) = e\nφ(b) = s\nφ(c) = r\nφ(c^2) = r^2\nφ(bc) = sr\nφ(bc^2) = sr^2\n\nIt is easy to verify that φ is a bijection and preserves the group operation. For example, φ(c^2 * b) = φ(bc^2) = sr^2, and φ(c^2) * φ(b) = r^2 * s = sr^2. Since φ is an isomorphism, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 6, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
