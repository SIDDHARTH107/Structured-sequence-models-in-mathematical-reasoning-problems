    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the machine working continuously for the next 2 weeks without any breakdown, we first need to find the probability of the machine not breaking down in a week.\n\nThe probability of a machine not breaking down in a week is 1 - the probability of breaking down, which is:\n\n1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of the machine not breaking down for 2 consecutive weeks. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of the machine not breaking down in each week:\n\n0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64\n\nSo, the probability of the machine working continuously for the next 2 weeks without any breakdown is 0.64 or 64%."
