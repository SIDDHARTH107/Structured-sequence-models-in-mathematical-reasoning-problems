    "message_2": "First, let's write down the system of equations with the measured coefficients:\n\n```\n4.08x + 2.04y - 3.06z = 7.92\n-1.96x + 5.1y + 4.08z = 9.18\n2.94x + 1.02y + 2.04z = 5.94\n```\n\nWe can represent this system of equations as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of unknowns (x, y, z), and b is the column vector of constants:\n\n```\nA = |  4.08  2.04 -3.06 |\n    | -1.96  5.1   4.08 |\n    |  2.94  1.02  2.04 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 7.92 |\n    | 9.18 |\n    | 5.94 |\n```\n\nTo solve this system using the least squares method, we need to find the solution x that minimizes the residual ||Ax - b||. The least squares solution can be found using the normal equation:\n\n```\nx = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * b\n```\n\nwhere A^T is the transpose of A and (A^T * A)^(-1) is the inverse of the matrix product A^T * A.\n\nFirst, let's compute A^T:\n\n```\nA^T = |  4.08 -1.96  2.94 |\n      |  2.04  5.1   1.02 |\n      | -3.06  4.08  2.04 |\n```\n\nNow, let's compute the product A^T * A:\n\n```\nA^T * A = |  4.08^2 + (-1.96)^2 + 2.94^2    4.08*2.04 + (-1.96)*5.1 + 2.94*1.02    4.08*(-3.06) + (-1.96)*4.08 + 2.94*2.04 |\n          |  2.04*4.08 + 5.1*(-1.96) + 1.02*2.94    2.04^2 + 5.1^2 + 1.02^2    2.04*(-3.06) + 5.1*4.08 + 1.02*2.04 |\n          | -3.06*4.08 + 4.08*(-1.96) + 2.04*2.94    -3.06*2.04 + 4.08*5.1 + 2.04*1.02    (-3.06)^2 + 4.08^2 + 2.04^2 |\n\nA^T * A = |  26.9616   8.6976 -14.5536 |\n          |   8.6976  27.6604  12.2448 |\n          | -14.5536  12.2448  29.1616 |\n```\n\nNext, let's compute the inverse of A^T * A:\n\n```\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = |  0.0451 -0.0087  0.0148 |\n                 | -0.0087  0.0382 -0.0267 |\n                 |  0.0148 -0.0267  0.0455 |\n```\n\nNow, let's compute the product A^T * b:\n\n```\nA^T * b = |  4.08*7.92 + (-1.96)*9.18 + 2.94*5.94 |\n          |  2.04*7.92 + 5.1*9.18 + 1.02*5.94 |\n          | -3.06*7.92 + 4.08*9.18 + 2.04*5.94 |\n\nA^T * b = |  32.7936 |\n          |  59.8752 |\n          |  20.7936 |\n```\n\nFinally, let's compute the least squares solution x:\n\n```\nx = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * b = |  0.0451 -0.0087  0.0148 | * | 32.7936 |\n                                | -0.0087  0.0382 -0.0267 |   | 59.8752 |\n                                |  0.0148 -0.0267  0.0455 |   | 20.7936 |\n\nx = | 1.0000 |\n    | 1.9999 |\n    | 0.9999 |\n```\n\nSo, the least squares solution for the system of equations is approximately:\n\n```\nx ≈ 1.0000\ny ≈ 1.9999\nz ≈ 0.9999\n```"
