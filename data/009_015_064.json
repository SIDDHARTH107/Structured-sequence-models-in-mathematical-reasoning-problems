    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a potential question for a math student: \n\nA certain radioactive substance has a half-life of 10 days. If the initial mass of the substance is 200 grams, what will be the mass after 30 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 200 grams, the time elapsed is 30 days, and the half-life is 10 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/2)^(30/10)\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/2)^3\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/8)\nFinal mass = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, the mass of the radioactive substance will be 25 grams."
