    "message_2": "a) To find the critical points of $f$, we need to find the points where the gradient of $f$ is zero. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (-4x^3 - 12x^2y + 3y^2 + 8x, -4x^3y + 6xy + 2y)$\n\nSetting both components of the gradient to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$-4x^3 - 12x^2y + 3y^2 + 8x = 0$ (1)\n$-4x^3y + 6xy + 2y = 0$ (2)\n\nFrom equation (2), we can factor out $y$:\n\n$y(-4x^3 + 6x + 2) = 0$\n\nSo either $y = 0$ or $-4x^3 + 6x + 2 = 0$. Let's consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: $y = 0$\n\nPlugging $y = 0$ into equation (1), we get:\n\n$-4x^3 + 8x = 0$\n\nFactoring out $x$, we get:\n\n$x(-4x^2 + 8) = 0$\n\nSo either $x = 0$ or $-4x^2 + 8 = 0$. The latter equation gives us:\n\n$x^2 = 2$\n\nThus, $x = \\pm\\sqrt{2}$. So, for case 1, we have the critical points $(0,0)$, $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, and $(-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$.\n\nCase 2: $-4x^3 + 6x + 2 = 0$\n\nLet $g(x) = -4x^3 + 6x + 2$. We can find the critical points of $g(x)$ by setting its derivative to zero:\n\n$g'(x) = -12x^2 + 6 = 0$\n\n$x^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus, $x = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Plugging these values back into equation (1), we can solve for $y$:\n\nFor $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$:\n\n$-4\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3 - 12\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2y + 3y^2 + 8\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 0$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $y$, we get $y = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. So, for this case, we have the critical points $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$.\n\nFor $x = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$:\n\n$-4\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3 - 12\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2y + 3y^2 - 8\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 0$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $y$, we get $y = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. So, for this case, we have the critical points $\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$ and $\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$.\n\nIn total, we have 7 critical points: $(0,0)$, $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, $(-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$, $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$, $\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$, and $\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$.\n\nb) To determine the nature of each critical point, we need to look at the Hessian matrix of $f$, which is given by:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-12x^2 - 24xy + 8 & -12x^2 + 6y \\\\\n-12x^2 + 6y & 6x + 2\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can determine the nature of each critical point by looking at the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point. If both eigenvalues are positive, the point is a local minimum; if both are negative, it's a local maximum; if one is positive and one is negative, it's a saddle point.\n\nEvaluating the Hessian matrix at each critical point and calculating its eigenvalues, we find:\n\n- $(0,0)$: Eigenvalues are $8$ and $2$, so it's a local minimum.\n- $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$: Eigenvalues are $-16$ and $-2$, so it's a local maximum.\n- $(-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$: Eigenvalues are $-16$ and $-2$, so it's a local maximum.\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$: Eigenvalues are $-4$ and $4$, so it's a saddle point.\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$: Eigenvalues are $-4$ and $4$, so it's a saddle point.\n- $\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$: Eigenvalues are $-4$ and $4$, so it's a saddle point.\n- $\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$: Eigenvalues are $-4$ and $4$, so it's a saddle point.\n\nSo, we have 1 local minimum, 2 local maxima, and 4 saddle points.\n\nc) The level set $f^{-1}(0)$ is the set of points $(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y) = 0$. In other words, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$-x^4 - 4x^3y + 3xy^2 + 4x^2 + y^2 = 0$\n\nThis equation is quite complicated, and finding an explicit solution for the level set is difficult. However, we can still determine the number of connected components by looking at the critical points and their Morse indices.\n\nd) The Morse index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point. From our analysis in part (b), we have:\n\n- $(0,0)$: Morse index = 0 (local minimum)\n- $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$: Morse index = 2 (local maximum)\n- $(-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$: Morse index = 2 (local maximum)\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$: Morse index = 1 (saddle point)\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$: Morse index = 1 (saddle point)\n- $\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$: Morse index = 1 (saddle point)\n- $\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$: Morse index = 1 (saddle point)"
