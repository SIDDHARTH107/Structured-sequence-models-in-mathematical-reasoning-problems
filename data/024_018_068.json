    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature K is the product of the principal curvatures, i.e., $K = \\kappa_1 \\cdot \\kappa_2$. In this case, we are given that $K = -1$, $\\kappa_1 = -2$, and $\\kappa_2 = 3$. \n\nTo find the sectional curvature for the plane spanned by the two principal directions, we can simply use the Gaussian curvature formula:\n\n$K = \\kappa_1 \\cdot \\kappa_2$\n\n$-1 = (-2) \\cdot (3)$\n\nHowever, this equation does not hold true, as the left side is -1 and the right side is -6. This means that there is an inconsistency in the given information, and it is not possible to have a surface with Gaussian curvature -1 and principal curvatures -2 and 3. Therefore, we cannot calculate the sectional curvature for this case."
