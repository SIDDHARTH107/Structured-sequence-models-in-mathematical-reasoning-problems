Suppose that we have the initial condition\n$$\nf(z) = \\mathrm{Im}(z), \\,\\,\\,\\, z\\in\\mathbb{C},\\,\\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{Im}(z)>0.\n$$\nDetermine a formula for the solution to the heat equation under these initial conditions, $u(z,t)=\\dots$, and find $u(i,1)$, i.e., the value of the solution at $z=i$ and $t=1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial condition, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(z,t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$\nX(x)Y(y)\\frac{dT}{dt} = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t).\n$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T}\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}.\n$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda,\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -\\lambda.\n$$\n\nThe first equation can be solved directly:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda T \\implies T(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}.\n$$\n\nThe second equation can be separated into two equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\mu, \\quad \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda - \\mu,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is another constant. These equations can be solved as:\n\n$$\nX(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\mu}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}x),\n$$\n\n$$\nY(y) = C\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda-\\mu}y) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda-\\mu}y).\n$$\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the initial condition $u(z,0) = f(z) = \\mathrm{Im}(z) = y$. This gives:\n\n$$\nY(y) = y \\implies D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda-\\mu}y) = y.\n$$\n\nSince $D$ cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sqrt{\\lambda-\\mu} = 1$. Thus, $\\lambda - \\mu = 1$. We can now rewrite the solution as:\n\n$$\nu(z,t) = e^{-\\lambda t}\\left[A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\mu}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}x)\\right]\\left[C\\cosh(y) + y\\sinh(y)\\right].\n$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$, we need to use boundary conditions or other information about the problem. However, without further information, we cannot determine a unique solution.\n\nTo find the value of the solution at $z=i$ and $t=1$, we can plug in the values $x=0$, $y=1$, and $t=1$:\n\n$$\nu(i,1) = e^{-\\lambda}\\left[A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0)\\right]\\left[C\\cosh(1) + \\sinh(1)\\right] = Ae^{-\\lambda}(C\\cosh(1) + \\sinh(1)).\n$$\n\nAgain, without further information, we cannot determine a unique value for $u(i,1)$."
