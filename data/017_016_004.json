    "message_2": "First, we will show that there exists an element of order 3 and an element of order 9 in G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G is either 1 or 27. If there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it must be normal in G, and since it has order 27, it must be G itself. In this case, G is a p-group, and by the class equation, we know that the center of G, Z(G), is nontrivial. Thus, there exists an element x in Z(G) with order 3, and we have found our element of order 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, there must be an element y in G that is not in any of the 3-Sylow subgroups. The order of y must be a power of 3, so either 3, 9, or 27. If the order of y is 27, then G is cyclic and we have found our element of order 9. If the order of y is 3, then the subgroup generated by y is a 3-Sylow subgroup, which contradicts our assumption that y is not in any 3-Sylow subgroup. Thus, the order of y must be 9, and we have found our element of order 9.\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIf G has an element of order 27, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C27. So, let's assume that G does not have an element of order 27. We have already shown that G has an element x of order 3 and an element y of order 9. Let H be the subgroup generated by y, so |H| = 9. Since the order of x is 3, we know that x^3 = e. Also, since the order of y is 9, we know that y^9 = e.\n\nNow, consider the element xy. Since x and y are both in G, we know that (xy)^27 = e. We want to show that (xy)^9 ≠ e and (xy)^3 ≠ e. If (xy)^9 = e, then x^9y^9 = e, which implies x^9 = y^(-9). But the order of x is 3, so x^9 = e, and thus y^(-9) = e, which contradicts the fact that the order of y is 9. Similarly, if (xy)^3 = e, then x^3y^3 = e, which implies y^3 = e, again contradicting the fact that the order of y is 9. Thus, (xy)^9 ≠ e and (xy)^3 ≠ e, so the order of xy is 27.\n\nNow, we have shown that G has elements of order 3, 9, and 27. Since G has an element of order 27, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27. If G does not have an element of order 27, then G has a subgroup H of order 9 and an element x of order 3 such that x is not in H. In this case, G is a semidirect product of H and the subgroup generated by x, and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27."
