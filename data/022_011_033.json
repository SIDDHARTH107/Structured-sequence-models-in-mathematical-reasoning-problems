    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function $f(z) = 2z^3 - 5z^2 + 3z - 7$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which $f(z) = 0$. This is a cubic polynomial, and finding its zeros analytically can be quite challenging. In general, one can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or synthetic division to approximate the zeros. However, without more information or tools, we cannot provide the exact zeros of this polynomial.\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function $g(z) = \\frac{\\sin(3z)}{(z-2)^2(z+1)}$. Poles are the points in the complex plane where the function becomes infinite. This occurs when the denominator of the function is equal to zero. So, we need to find the zeros of the denominator:\n\n$(z-2)^2(z+1) = 0$\n\nThis equation has two zeros:\n\n1. $z = 2$ (with multiplicity 2, since it is a double root)\n2. $z = -1$ (with multiplicity 1)\n\nSo, the poles of the function $g(z)$ are $z = 2$ (with multiplicity 2) and $z = -1$ (with multiplicity 1) in the complex plane."
