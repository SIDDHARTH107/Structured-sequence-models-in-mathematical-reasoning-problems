    "message_1": "A principal has to hire an agent to perform a specific task. The principal will pay the agent a fixed salary plus a bonus based on the outcome of the task. The probability that the agent will succeed in the task is 0.7, and the bonus for success is $500. However, the agent may shirk effort, which will decrease the probability of success to 0.4. If the task fails, the bonus will be $0. The cost of shirking effort for the agent is $100.\n\nQuestion: What is the optimal salary the principal should offer to maximize the agent's effort?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the agent's effort, the principal needs to ensure that the agent's expected payoff from exerting effort is greater than the expected payoff from shirking effort. Let's denote the fixed salary as S.\n\n1. Expected payoff from exerting effort:\nProbability of success * Bonus + Salary - Cost of effort\n0.7 * $500 + S - 0\n\n2. Expected payoff from shirking effort:\nProbability of success * Bonus + Salary - Cost of shirking\n0.4 * $500 + S - $100\n\nTo maximize the agent's effort, the expected payoff from exerting effort should be greater than the expected payoff from shirking effort:\n\n0.7 * $500 + S > 0.4 * $500 + S - $100\n\nNow, let's solve for S:\n\n0.7 * $500 - 0.4 * $500 > - $100\n$350 - $200 > - $100\n$150 > - $100\n\nSo, the minimum difference in expected payoffs needed to incentivize the agent to exert effort is $250. Therefore, the optimal salary (S) should be at least $250 greater than the expected payoff from shirking effort:\n\nS = 0.4 * $500 + $100 + $250\nS = $200 + $100 + $250\nS = $550\n\nThe principal should offer a fixed salary of at least $550 to maximize the agent's effort."
