    "message_2": "To find the number of subgroups of order 5 in a group of order 20, we can use Sylow's Theorems. Let G be a group of order 20, and let n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By Sylow's Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which is 20/5 = 4.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only divisor of 4 that is congruent to 1 modulo 5 is 1. Therefore, there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup of G, and this subgroup has order 5."
