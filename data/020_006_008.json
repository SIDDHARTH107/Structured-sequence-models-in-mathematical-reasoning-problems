    "message_1": "A company is deciding how many units of two products, A and B, to produce in order to maximize their profit. Product A requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor per unit, while product B requires 2 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor per unit. The company has 500 hours of machine time and 450 hours of labor available. Product A generates a profit of $50 per unit and product B generates a profit of $60 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
