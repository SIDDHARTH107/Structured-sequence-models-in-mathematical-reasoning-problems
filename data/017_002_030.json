    "message_2": "To find the generator 'b' of the subgroup H, we first need to determine the possible orders of H. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since the order of G is 30, the possible orders of H are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible generators 'b' for each order of H:\n\n1. If the order of H is 1, then H = {e}, where e is the identity element. In this case, b = e = a^0.\n\n2. If the order of H is 2, then H = {e, a^15}, since 30/2 = 15. In this case, b = a^15.\n\n3. If the order of H is 3, then H = {e, a^10, a^20}, since 30/3 = 10. In this case, b = a^10.\n\n4. If the order of H is 5, then H = {e, a^6, a^12, a^18, a^24}, since 30/5 = 6. In this case, b = a^6.\n\n5. If the order of H is 6, then H = {e, a^5, a^10, a^15, a^20, a^25}, since 30/6 = 5. In this case, b = a^5.\n\n6. If the order of H is 10, then H = {e, a^3, a^6, a^9, a^12, a^15, a^18, a^21, a^24, a^27}, since 30/10 = 3. In this case, b = a^3.\n\n7. If the order of H is 15, then H = {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10, a^12, a^14, a^16, a^18, a^20, a^22, a^24, a^26, a^28}, since 30/15 = 2. In this case, b = a^2.\n\n8. If the order of H is 30, then H = G, and b = a.\n\nSo, the possible generators 'b' of the subgroup H are a^0, a^2, a^3, a^5, a^6, a^10, a^15, and a. Note that without more information about the specific subgroup H, we cannot determine a unique generator 'b'."
