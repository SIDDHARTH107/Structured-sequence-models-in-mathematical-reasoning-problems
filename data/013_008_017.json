    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, six players each contribute some amount of money to a public pot. The total amount in the pot is then doubled and split evenly among all six players. However, players who don't contribute still receive their share of the doubled pot. \n\nThe payoff matrix for the game is as follows:\n\n- If all six players contribute $5, they each receive $10 from the doubled pot.\n- If only five players contribute $5 and one player contributes nothing, the five contributors each receive $8 from the doubled pot, and the non-contributor receives $16.\n- If only four players contribute $5 and two players contribute nothing, the four contributors each receive $7.50 from the doubled pot, and the two non-contributors receive $15 each.\n\nAssuming all six players are rational and self-interested, what is each player's best strategy, and what is the resulting payoff for each player?",
    "message_2": "In this Public Goods Game, each player's best strategy is to not contribute to the public pot, as they will still receive a share of the doubled pot without having to contribute any money. This is because each player is rational and self-interested, and they will choose the strategy that maximizes their individual payoff.\n\nIf all six players follow this strategy and contribute nothing, the total amount in the pot will be $0. When the pot is doubled, it will still be $0, and when it is split evenly among the six players, each player will receive $0.\n\nSo, the resulting payoff for each player, when all players follow the best strategy of not contributing, is $0."
