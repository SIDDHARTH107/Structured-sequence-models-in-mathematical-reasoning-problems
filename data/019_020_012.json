    "message_2": "The time complexity of the sorting algorithm used in this particular program is O(n*log(n)), as it sorts n elements with n*log(n) operations. To solve for n=1000, we can plug in the value of n into the time complexity equation:\n\nTime complexity = O(n*log(n))\nTime complexity = O(1000*log(1000))\n\nUsing the base 2 logarithm (commonly used in computer science):\n\nTime complexity = O(1000*log2(1000))\nTime complexity = O(1000*9.97) (approximately, since log2(1000) â‰ˆ 9.97)\n\nTime complexity = O(9970)\n\nSo, for n=1000, the time complexity of the sorting algorithm is approximately O(9970). However, when discussing time complexity, we generally focus on the highest order term and ignore the constant factors. Therefore, the time complexity remains O(n*log(n))."
