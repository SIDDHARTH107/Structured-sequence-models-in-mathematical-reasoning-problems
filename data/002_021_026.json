    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees.\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 8²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 64\n\nArea of sector = 64π/6\n\nArea of sector = 32π/3\n\nThe area of the sector is (32π/3) square centimeters."
