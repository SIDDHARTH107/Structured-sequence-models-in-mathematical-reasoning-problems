    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the given function y = 4 sin(3x - π/4), we can analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A sin(Bx - C).\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 4. So, the amplitude is 4.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sinusoidal function is the length of one complete cycle. It is given by the formula P = 2π/|B|, where B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, B = 3. So, the period is P = 2π/3.\n\nPhase Shift (C): The phase shift is the horizontal shift of the sinusoidal function. It is given by the formula C = C/B, where C is the constant inside the sine function. In this case, C = π/4. Since B = 3, the phase shift is (π/4)/3 = π/12.\n\nNow, let's graph one full period of the function y = 4 sin(3x - π/4):\n\n1. Start by drawing the sine function y = sin(x) on the coordinate plane.\n2. Stretch the graph vertically by a factor of 4 to get y = 4 sin(x).\n3. Compress the graph horizontally by a factor of 3 to get y = 4 sin(3x).\n4. Shift the graph to the right by π/12 units to get y = 4 sin(3x - π/4).\n\nThe graph of one full period of the function y = 4 sin(3x - π/4) will have an amplitude of 4, a period of 2π/3, and a phase shift of π/12 to the right."
