    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The production process for A requires 2 units of resource X and 1 unit of resource Y, while the production process for B requires 1 unit of resource X and 3 units of resource Y. The total available units of resource X is 300 and resource Y is 450. The profit margins for the products A and B are $5 and $8 respectively. The company wants to maximize its profit. How many units of products A and B should the company produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are:\n2x + y ≤ 300 (resource X)\nx + 3y ≤ 450 (resource Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 5x + 8y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 300\ny ≤ -2x + 300\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 450\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 150\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (0,150), (150,0), and (100,100).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\n2. P(0,150) = 5(0) + 8(150) = 1200\n3. P(150,0) = 5(150) + 8(0) = 750\n4. P(100,100) = 5(100) + 8(100) = 1300\n\nThe maximum profit is $1300 when producing 100 units of product A and 100 units of product B."
