    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (which is a circle) and the lateral area (which is the area of the curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is:\n\nSurface Area = πr² (base area) + πr * l (lateral area)\n\nwhere r is the radius, and l is the slant height of the cone. \n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle formed by the height, radius, and slant height:\n\nl² = r² + h²\n\nwhere r is the radius (5 cm), and h is the height (12 cm).\n\nl² = (5 cm)² + (12 cm)²\nl² = 25 cm² + 144 cm²\nl² = 169 cm²\nl = √169 cm\nl = 13 cm\n\nNow we can find the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = π(5 cm)² + π(5 cm)(13 cm)\nSurface Area = 25π cm² + 65π cm²\nSurface Area = 90π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is approximately 282.74 cm² (rounded to two decimal places)."
