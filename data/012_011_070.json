    "message_2": "A cut vertex is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nSince vertex 4 is a cut vertex, removing it will split the graph into at least two connected components. Let's denote these components as A and B, with vertex 4 originally connecting them.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of edges in each component. Since the graph has 7 vertices and 9 edges, and vertex 4 is a cut vertex, there must be at least 1 edge connecting vertex 4 to each of the components A and B. Therefore, there are at least 2 edges incident to vertex 4.\n\nLet's assume that there are x edges connecting vertex 4 to component A and y edges connecting vertex 4 to component B. Then, x + y = 9 - (number of bridges).\n\nSince vertex 4 is a cut vertex, removing it will disconnect the graph, meaning that there must be at least 1 bridge between the components A and B. Let's denote the number of bridges as b.\n\nNow, we have the following equation:\n\nx + y = 9 - b\n\nSince there must be at least 1 bridge, we have:\n\nx + y = 9 - 1\nx + y = 8\n\nSince x and y are both positive integers (as they represent the number of edges), the minimum value for x and y is 1. This means that there is at least 1 edge connecting vertex 4 to each of the components A and B.\n\nThus, the number of bridges in the graph is b = 1."
