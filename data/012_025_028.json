    "message_2": "A cycle that visits each vertex exactly once is called a Hamiltonian cycle. To find the longest Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph, we can try to construct a path that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n\nLet's start with vertex 1:\n\n1. From vertex 1, we can go to vertices 2, 3, or 5. Let's choose vertex 2.\n2. From vertex 2, we can go to vertices 1, 3, or 6. Since we've already visited vertex 1, let's choose vertex 3.\n3. From vertex 3, we can go to vertices 1, 2, 4, or 7. We've already visited vertices 1 and 2, so let's choose vertex 4.\n4. From vertex 4, we can go to vertices 3, 6, or 7. We've already visited vertex 3, so let's choose vertex 6.\n5. From vertex 6, we can go to vertices 2, 4, or 8. We've already visited vertices 2 and 4, so let's choose vertex 8.\n6. From vertex 8, we can go to vertices 5, 6, or 7. We haven't visited vertex 5 yet, so let's choose vertex 5.\n7. From vertex 5, we can go to vertices 1, 7, or 8. We've already visited vertex 8, so let's choose vertex 7.\n8. From vertex 7, we can go to vertices 3, 4, 5, or 8. We've already visited vertices 3, 4, and 5, so let's choose vertex 8.\n\nNow, we have visited all vertices exactly once and returned to the starting vertex. The Hamiltonian cycle is 1-2-3-4-6-8-5-7-1."
