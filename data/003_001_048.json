    "message_1": "A triangle has a right angle at one vertex and the length of the adjacent side is 6 cm while the length of the opposite side is 8 cm. Determine the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using trigonometric ratios.",
    "message_2": "To determine the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the adjacent side has a length of 6 cm, and the opposite side has a length of 8 cm.\n\nLet's denote the length of the hypotenuse as c. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nc² = 6² + 8²\nc² = 36 + 64\nc² = 100\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √100\nc = 10\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is 10 cm."
