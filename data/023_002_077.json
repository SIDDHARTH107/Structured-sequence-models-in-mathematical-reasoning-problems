    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and the constant term a_0.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(x) on the interval [-L, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere the Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/(2L)) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFor our problem, f(x) = x and L = π. Let's find the coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = (1/(2π)) * [x^2/2](-π to π) = 0\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nπx/π) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx\nSince f(x) is an odd function and cos(nx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nπx/π) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\nUsing integration by parts:\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(nx)\n\n∫ x * sin(nx) dx = -x(1/n) * cos(nx) - ∫ -(1/n) * cos(nx) dx\n= -x(1/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral from -π to π:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-π(1/n) * cos(nπ) + (1/n^2) * sin(nπ) - (-π(1/n) * cos(-nπ) + (1/n^2) * sin(-nπ))]\nb_n = (1/π) * [2π(1/n) * cos(nπ)] = 2/n * cos(nπ)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π]:\n\nf(x) = Σ [2/n * cos(nπ) * sin(nx)]\n\nThe convergence of the Fourier series depends on the original function's properties. In this case, f(x) = x is continuous and piecewise smooth on the interval [-π, π]. The Fourier series converges to the original function at all points where f(x) is continuous. At the endpoints of the interval, the Fourier series converges to the average of the function's limits from the left and right.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] converges to the original function at all points in the interval except at the endpoints, where it converges to the average of the limits from the left and right."
