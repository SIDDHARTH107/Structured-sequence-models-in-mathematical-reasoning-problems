    "message_2": "To prove this theorem, we will use the definition and properties of a group. A group (G, *) is a set G with a binary operation * that satisfies the following four properties:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, the result of the operation a * b is also in G.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n3. Identity element: There exists an element e in G such that for every element a in G, the equation e * a = a * e = a holds.\n4. Inverse element: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's prove the theorem: \"In every group, the product of any two elements is also an element of the group.\"\n\nProof:\n\nLet G be a group with the binary operation *. Let a and b be any two elements in G. According to the closure property of a group, the result of the operation a * b must also be an element in G. Therefore, the product of any two elements in a group is also an element of the group.\n\nHence, the theorem is proven."
