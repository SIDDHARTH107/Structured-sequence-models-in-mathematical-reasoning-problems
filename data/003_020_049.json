    "message_1": "A 50-foot ladder leans against a building, and the angle between the ladder and the ground is 65 degrees. How far is the base of the ladder from the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side (the side next to the angle) to the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle). In this case, the adjacent side is the distance from the base of the ladder to the building, which we'll call x, and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder, which is 50 feet.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ncos(65°) = x / 50\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of 65 degrees:\n\ncos(65°) ≈ 0.4226\n\nNext, we can solve for x:\n\n0.4226 = x / 50\n\nx ≈ 0.4226 * 50\nx ≈ 21.13\n\nSo, the base of the ladder is approximately 21.13 feet from the building."
