The encryption key should satisfy 1 < e < ϕ(N) and gcd(e, ϕ(N)) = 1. The decryption key should satisfy d*e ≡ 1 (mod ϕ(N)).",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute N and ϕ(N):\n\nN = p * q = 7 * 13 = 91\nϕ(N) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (7-1) * (13-1) = 6 * 12 = 72\n\nNow, we need to find an encryption key e such that 1 < e < ϕ(N) and gcd(e, ϕ(N)) = 1. Let's try e = 5:\n\ngcd(5, 72) = 1\n\nSince 1 < 5 < 72 and gcd(5, 72) = 1, we can use e = 5 as the encryption key.\n\nNext, we need to find a decryption key d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod ϕ(N)). In other words, we need to find the modular inverse of e (mod ϕ(N)):\n\n5 * d ≡ 1 (mod 72)\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of e:\n\nExtended Euclidean Algorithm for e = 5 and ϕ(N) = 72:\n\n1. 72 = 5 * 14 + 2\n2. 5 = 2 * 2 + 1\n3. 2 = 1 * 2\n\nNow, substitute back:\n\n1. 1 = 5 - 2 * 2\n2. 1 = 5 - 2 * (72 - 5 * 14)\n3. 1 = 5 - 2 * 72 + 28 * 5\n4. 1 = 29 * 5 - 2 * 72\n\nFrom the last equation, we can see that d = 29, since 29 * 5 - 2 * 72 = 1.\n\nSo, the encryption key (e) is 5, and the decryption key (d) is 29. The public key is (N, e) = (91, 5), and the private key is (N, d) = (91, 29)."
