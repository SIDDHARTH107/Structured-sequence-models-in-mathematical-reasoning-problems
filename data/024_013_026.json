    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to find the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for the given metric is:\n\n$g = \\begin{bmatrix}\n9 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 9 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 16\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is:\n\n$|g| = \\det(g) = 9 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 16 = 1296$\n\nNow, the volume form is given by the square root of the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by the standard volume form in 3-dimensional Euclidean space:\n\n$\\text{vol}(M) = \\sqrt{|g|} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = \\sqrt{1296} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = 36 \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$\n\nSo, the volume form of the given metric on the three-dimensional manifold $M$ is:\n\n$\\text{vol}(M) = 36 \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$"
