    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 30 and 45 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (45) by the smaller number (30) and find the remainder.\n   45 รท 30 = 1 with a remainder of 15.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (45) with the smaller number (30) and the smaller number with the remainder (15) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 30 and 15.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (30) by the smaller number (15) and find the remainder.\n   30 รท 15 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the smaller number (15) in the previous step.\n\nSo, the GCD of 30 and 45 is 15."
