    "message_2": "To determine the singular points of X, we need to find the points where the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to x and y both vanish. The defining equation is:\n\nf(x, y) = x^3 - y^2\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = -2y\n\nFor a point (x, y) to be a singular point, both partial derivatives must vanish simultaneously:\n\n3x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n-2y = 0 => y = 0\n\nThus, the only singular point of X is (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's calculate the dimension of the Zariski tangent space at the singular point (0, 0). The Zariski tangent space at a point (x, y) is the vector space of all tangent vectors to X at that point. In this case, we can represent the tangent vectors as (dx, dy), where dx and dy are complex numbers.\n\nThe tangent vectors must satisfy the linearized equation of the variety at the singular point. To find the linearized equation, we take the total differential of the defining equation:\n\ndf = ∂f/∂x dx + ∂f/∂y dy = 3x^2 dx - 2y dy\n\nAt the singular point (0, 0), this equation becomes:\n\n0 = 0 dx - 0 dy\n\nSince there are no constraints on dx and dy, the Zariski tangent space at the singular point (0, 0) is the entire complex plane C^2. Therefore, the dimension of the Zariski tangent space at the singular point (0, 0) is 2."
