    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players, Alex and Bob, trying to divide a prize of $100. Before dividing the prize, they can communicate with each other through a messaging system, but they cannot make any binding agreements. The players know that if they cannot agree on a division, the prize will be forfeited.\n\nAlex sends a message to Bob, stating that he is willing to accept any division where he receives at least $30. Bob also sends a message to Alex, stating that he would prefer to receive at least $60.\n\nBased on this information, what is the most likely division of the prize, and why?",
    "message_2": "Based on this information, the most likely division of the prize would be $40 for Alex and $60 for Bob. This is because both players have expressed their minimum acceptable amounts, and they both want to avoid forfeiting the prize. \n\nAlex is willing to accept any division where he receives at least $30, and Bob prefers to receive at least $60. The division of $40 for Alex and $60 for Bob satisfies both of their minimum requirements and ensures that the prize is not forfeited. Additionally, this division is also fair in the sense that it is closer to an equal split than if Alex were to receive only $30 and Bob were to receive $70."
