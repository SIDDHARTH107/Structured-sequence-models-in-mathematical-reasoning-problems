    "message_1": "A knapsack can hold a maximum weight of 15 pounds. There are 5 items with different weights: 2 pounds, 4 pounds, 6 pounds, 8 pounds, and 10 pounds. Each item also has a different value: $10, $20, $30, $40, and $50, respectively. What is the maximum value that can be packed into the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value that can be packed into the knapsack, we need to determine the combination of items that provides the highest value without exceeding the 15-pound weight limit. \n\nHere are the possible combinations that do not exceed the weight limit:\n\n1. 2-pound item + 4-pound item + 6-pound item = 12 pounds (total value: $10 + $20 + $30 = $60)\n2. 2-pound item + 4-pound item + 8-pound item = 14 pounds (total value: $10 + $20 + $40 = $70)\n3. 2-pound item + 6-pound item + 8-pound item = 16 pounds (exceeds the weight limit)\n4. 4-pound item + 6-pound item + 10-pound item = 20 pounds (exceeds the weight limit)\n\nThe combination with the highest value without exceeding the weight limit is the 2-pound item, the 4-pound item, and the 8-pound item, with a total value of $70."
