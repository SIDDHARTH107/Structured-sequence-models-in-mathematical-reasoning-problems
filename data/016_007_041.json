    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape that is created by recursively removing cubes from the initial cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube and the six cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed, leaving 20 cubes.\n\nFor a level-3 Menger sponge, this process is repeated three times. The number of cubes at each level can be calculated as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 20 cubes (20^1)\nLevel 2: 20^2 = 400 cubes\nLevel 3: 20^3 = 8,000 cubes\n\nSo, a level-3 Menger sponge constructed from an initial cube with a side length of 27 units requires a total of 8,000 cubes."
