    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. In this case, the only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5.\n\nNow, since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H must be cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Let K be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, which must have order 2. Since the order of K is 2, K is also cyclic and isomorphic to C2.\n\nSince the orders of H and K are coprime (5 and 2 are relatively prime), we have that the intersection of H and K is the identity element. Therefore, the product of the orders of H and K is equal to the order of G, which is 10. This means that G is the internal direct product of H and K.\n\nNow, we have two possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is abelian: In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which is C5 Ã— C2, and this is isomorphic to C10.\n\n2. G is non-abelian: In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, which has order 10 and is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon.\n\nTo determine which case we are in, we can look at the commutativity of G. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. If G is non-abelian, then there must exist an element in K that does not commute with an element in H. However, since H is normal in G, the conjugation action of K on H is trivial, which means that all elements of K commute with all elements of H. This implies that G is abelian, and thus G is isomorphic to C10."
