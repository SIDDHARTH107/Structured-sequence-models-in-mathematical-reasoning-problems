If the stock increases, the expected increase is $3.50, and if it decreases, the expected decrease is $2.20. What is the expected value of the stock price change for XYZ company on a given day?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the stock price change for XYZ company on a given day, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding value of that outcome and then add them together.\n\nExpected value = (probability of increase × expected increase) + (probability of decrease × expected decrease)\n\nExpected value = (0.4 × $3.50) + (0.6 × -$2.20)\n\nExpected value = ($1.40) + (-$1.32)\n\nExpected value = $0.08\n\nThe expected value of the stock price change for XYZ company on a given day is $0.08."
