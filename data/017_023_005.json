    "message_2": "To determine whether a group of order 72 is isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups, we can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of the group.\n\nA group of order 72 has the form 2^3 * 3^2, so we can apply the Sylow theorems to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nLet n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, n_2 must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, n_3 must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are unique, they are both normal in the group. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, the group is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, which is a cyclic group of order 72 (C72).\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, we cannot guarantee that the group is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. However, we can analyze the structure of the group further.\n\nSince there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 9, we know that there are 4 * (9 - 1) = 32 elements of order 9 in the group. This leaves 72 - 32 = 40 elements not of order 9. Among these 40 elements, there is the identity element and 39 remaining elements.\n\nSince there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 8, we know that there are 3 * (8 - 1) = 21 elements of order 8 in the group. This leaves 39 - 21 = 18 elements not of order 8 or 9.\n\nNow, we can consider the possibility of the group being isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2. The group A4 has order 12, so A4 × C3 × C2 has order 12 * 3 * 2 = 72. The structure of A4 × C3 × C2 contains elements of order 2, 3, and 4, which can account for the remaining 18 elements not of order 8 or 9. Therefore, it is possible for the group to be isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2.\n\n3. If the group is not isomorphic to C72 or A4 × C3 × C2, then it must be one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the specific group of order 72, we cannot definitively determine whether it is isomorphic to C72, A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72. However, we have shown that it is possible for the group to be isomorphic to any of these options based on the Sylow theorems and the structure of the group."
