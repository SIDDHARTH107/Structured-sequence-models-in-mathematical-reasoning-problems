    "message_2": "The given equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 represents a 3-dimensional sphere of radius 3 centered at the origin in the Euclidean space R^3. To consider a 2-dimensional manifold, we need to restrict the sphere to a 2-dimensional surface. Since the point (1, 1, √7) lies on the sphere, we can consider the tangent plane to the sphere at this point as our 2-dimensional manifold.\n\nFirst, let's find the normal vector to the sphere at the point (1, 1, √7). The gradient of the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 9 at this point will give us the normal vector:\n\n∇F(1, 1, √7) = (2x, 2y, 2z) = (2, 2, 2√7)\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane to the sphere at the point (1, 1, √7) using the normal vector:\n\n2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) + 2√7(z - √7) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx + y + √7z = 1 + 1 + 7 = 9\n\nNow, we have the equation of the tangent plane as our 2-dimensional manifold:\n\nM: x + y + √7z = 9\n\nSince this is a flat plane in Euclidean space, its scalar curvature is 0."
