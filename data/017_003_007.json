    "message_2": "A generator of a group of prime order 11 is an element that generates all the non-identity elements of the group when raised to different powers. In other words, it is an element g such that g^k (k = 1, 2, ..., 10) generates all the non-identity elements of the group.\n\nFor a group of prime order 11, we can consider the multiplicative group of integers modulo 11, denoted as (Z/11Z)*. This group has 10 elements: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. We are looking for an element g in this group such that g^k (mod 11) generates all the non-identity elements.\n\nLet's check the powers of each element modulo 11:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 11)\n2^4 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n2^5 ≡ 10 (mod 11)\n2^6 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n2^7 ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n2^8 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n2^9 ≡ 6 (mod 11)\n2^10 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nAs we can see, 2 is a generator of the group of prime order 11, as its powers generate all the non-identity elements of the group. Note that there can be more than one generator for a group of prime order, but 2 is one of them."
