    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the circular garden is 7 meters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 3.5 meters.\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(3.5)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 3.5\nC ≈ 21.9911\n\nTherefore, the perimeter (circumference) of the circular garden is approximately 21.99 meters."
