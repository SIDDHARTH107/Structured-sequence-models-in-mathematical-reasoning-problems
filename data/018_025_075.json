    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nSo, A △ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) ∩ B:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ B = {1, 2, 5} ∩ {3, 4, 5} = {5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B △ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, B △ A is equal to A △ B:\n\nB △ A = A △ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find (B △ A) ∩ A:\n\n(B △ A) ∩ A = {1, 2, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1, 2}\n\nWe can see that (A △ B) ∩ B = {5} and (B △ A) ∩ A = {1, 2}. These two results are not equal, which proves that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection."
