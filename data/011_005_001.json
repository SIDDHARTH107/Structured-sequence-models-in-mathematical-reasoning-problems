    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of the term containing $x^8$ in the expansion of $(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)^3$, we can use the multinomial theorem. The multinomial theorem states that for any positive integer $n$ and any non-negative integers $k_1, k_2, ..., k_m$ such that $k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m = n$, the coefficient of $x_1^{k_1}x_2^{k_2}...x_m^{k_m}$ in the expansion of $(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_m)^n$ is given by:\n\n$\\frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!...k_m!}$\n\nIn our case, we have $n = 3$ and we want to find the coefficient of $x^8$. We need to find all possible combinations of non-negative integers $k_1, k_2, ..., k_6$ such that $k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_6 = 8$ and $1k_1 + 2k_2 + 3k_3 + 4k_4 + 5k_5 + 6k_6 = 8$.\n\nThere are three possible combinations:\n\n1. $k_1 = 2, k_2 = 3, k_3 = 0, k_4 = 0, k_5 = 0, k_6 = 0$\n2. $k_1 = 0, k_2 = 1, k_3 = 2, k_4 = 0, k_5 = 0, k_6 = 0$\n3. $k_1 = 0, k_2 = 0, k_3 = 0, k_4 = 2, k_5 = 0, k_6 = 0$\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients for each combination using the multinomial theorem:\n\n1. $\\frac{3!}{2!3!0!0!0!0!} = \\frac{6}{12} = 1$\n2. $\\frac{3!}{0!1!2!0!0!0!} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$\n3. $\\frac{3!}{0!0!0!2!0!0!} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5$\n\nHowever, the third combination gives a non-integer coefficient, which is not possible in this context. Therefore, we can ignore this combination.\n\nThe coefficient of the term containing $x^8$ in the expansion of $(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)^3$ is the sum of the coefficients from the first two combinations: $1 + 3 = \\boxed{4}$."
