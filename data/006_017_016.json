    "message_1": "A certain type of traffic accident occurs on a road with a probability of 0.15. If 200 vehicles pass through the road, what is the probability that at least 25 vehicles will be involved in this type of accident?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (accidents) in n trials (vehicles)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (accident) for each trial (vehicle)\n- n is the number of trials (vehicles)\n- k is the number of successes (accidents)\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the probability of at least 25 accidents, so we need to find the sum of probabilities for 25 to 200 accidents. However, it's easier to find the probability of having less than 25 accidents (0 to 24) and then subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least 25 accidents.\n\nSo, we need to find:\n\nP(X≥25) = 1 - P(X<25) = 1 - Σ[P(X=k)] for k=0 to 24\n\nwhere p = 0.15 and n = 200.\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the sum of probabilities for k=0 to 24:\n\nΣ[P(X=k)] = Σ[C(200, k) * 0.15^k * (1-0.15)^(200-k)] for k=0 to 24\n\nCalculating this sum can be done using a calculator or software that can handle binomial probabilities, such as Python, R, or a statistical calculator.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find:\n\nΣ[P(X=k)] ≈ 0.0718\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 25 accidents:\n\nP(X≥25) = 1 - Σ[P(X=k)] ≈ 1 - 0.0718 ≈ 0.9282\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 vehicles will be involved in this type of accident is approximately 0.9282 or 92.82%."
