    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and vertical shift of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x) + 1, we need to identify the different components of the function.\n\nThe general form of a sine function is: f(x) = A*sin(Bx + C) + D\n\nWhere:\n- A is the amplitude\n- B determines the period\n- C is the phase shift\n- D is the vertical shift\n\nIn our function f(x) = 2sin(3x) + 1, we can see that:\n\nA = 2\nB = 3\nC = 0 (since there is no phase shift)\nD = 1\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude, period, and vertical shift:\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is the coefficient of the sine function. In our case, A = 2, so the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient B in the argument of the sine function. The period is given by the formula P = 2π/B. In our case, B = 3, so the period is P = 2π/3.\n\n3. Vertical Shift (D): The vertical shift is given by the constant term D. In our case, D = 1, so the vertical shift is 1 unit upward.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 2, the period is 2π/3, and the vertical shift is 1 unit upward."
