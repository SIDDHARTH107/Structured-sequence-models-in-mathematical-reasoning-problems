    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two products, A and B, and makes a profit of 3 dollars per unit for product A and 5 dollars per unit for product B. Each unit of A requires 1 hour of machine time and 2 hours of labor, while each unit of B requires 3 hours of machine time and 1 hour of labor. The manufacturer has 100 hours of machine time and 80 hours of labor available each day. How many units of each product should be produced daily in order to maximize the manufacturer's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 3x + 5y\n\nThe constraints are given by the available machine time and labor hours:\n1x + 3y ≤ 100 (machine time constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 80 (labor time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we will find the feasible region and then evaluate the objective function at the corner points.\n\nFirst, we will graph the constraints:\n\n1. x + 3y = 100\ny = (100 - x) / 3\n\n2. 2x + y = 80\ny = 80 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the area enclosed by the intersection of the two lines and the non-negativity constraints (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0).\n\nThe corner points of the feasible region are:\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 33.33)\nC(40, 0)\nD(20, 26.67)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 3x + 5y at each corner point:\n\nP(A) = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0\nP(B) = 3(0) + 5(33.33) = 166.65\nP(C) = 3(40) + 5(0) = 120\nP(D) = 3(20) + 5(26.67) = 173.35\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point D, where 20 units of product A and 26.67 units of product B should be produced daily. However, since the number of units must be a whole number, the manufacturer should produce 20 units of product A and 27 units of product B to maximize the profit of approximately 173 dollars per day."
