    "message_1": "A water tank in the shape of a cone has a radius of 3 meters and a depth of 6 meters. The tank is being filled at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute. How fast is the water level rising when the water is 4 meters deep?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the volume of a cone and the concept of related rates.\n\nThe volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nSince the tank is in the shape of a cone, the radius and height are related. When the tank is full, the radius is 3 meters and the height is 6 meters. We can set up a proportion to find the relationship between the radius and height:\n\nr/h = 3/6\nr = (1/2)h\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into the volume formula:\n\nV = (1/3)π((1/2)h)^2h\nV = (1/3)π(1/4)h^3\nV = (1/12)πh^3\n\nNow we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t):\n\ndV/dt = (1/12)π(3h^2)(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute, so dV/dt = 2. We want to find the rate at which the water level is rising (dh/dt) when the water is 4 meters deep (h = 4).\n\n2 = (1/12)π(3(4)^2)(dh/dt)\n\nNow we can solve for dh/dt:\n\n2 = (1/12)π(48)(dh/dt)\n2 = 4π(dh/dt)\ndh/dt = 1/2π\n\nSo, the water level is rising at a rate of 1/(2π) meters per minute when the water is 4 meters deep."
