    "message_2": "To find the 7th term of the sequence, we will continue to apply the rule given: each term is equal to two times the previous term plus the term before that.\n\nWe already have the first five terms: {1, 2, 5, 12, 29}\n\nTo find the 6th term, we apply the rule: (2 * 29) + 12 = 58 + 12 = 70\n\nNow, to find the 7th term, we apply the rule again: (2 * 70) + 29 = 140 + 29 = 169\n\nSo, the 7th term of the sequence is 169."
