    "message_2": "To find the total number of bits in the subkeys required for this cipher, we simply multiply the number of rounds by the number of bits in each subkey.\n\nTotal number of bits = (Number of rounds) × (Number of bits in each subkey)\n\nTotal number of bits = 6 rounds × 48 bits per subkey\n\nTotal number of bits = 288 bits"
