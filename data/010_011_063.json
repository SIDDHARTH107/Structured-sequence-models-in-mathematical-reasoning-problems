    "message_2": "The given manifold $M$ is described by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$, which represents a sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The additional property states that if $(x, y, z) \\in M$, then $(x, y, -z) \\in M$. This property implies that the manifold is symmetric with respect to the xy-plane, i.e., if a point is in the manifold, its reflection across the xy-plane is also in the manifold.\n\nNow, let's determine the dimension of $M$. Since $M$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, its dimension cannot be greater than 3. We can see that $M$ is not a 3-dimensional manifold, as it is constrained by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$. \n\nTo see that $M$ is a 2-dimensional manifold, consider a point $(x, y, z) \\in M$. We can find a small neighborhood around this point that lies entirely within $M$ and is homeomorphic to an open disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For example, consider the tangent plane to the sphere at $(x, y, z)$. This tangent plane intersects the sphere in a single point, and we can find a small open disk in the tangent plane centered at $(x, y, z)$ that lies entirely within $M$. This shows that $M$ is locally 2-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the manifold $M$ is 2."
