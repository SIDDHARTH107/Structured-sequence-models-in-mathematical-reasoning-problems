The transportation cost per unit from each factory to the distribution centers located in five different cities is given in the table below:\n\n|     | City 1 | City 2 | City 3 | City 4 | City 5 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Factory A | $12$ | $7$ | $16$ | $11$ | $9$ |\n| Factory B | $10$ | $9$ | $15$ | $14$ | $7$ |\n| Factory C | $7$ | $12$ | $11$ | $9$ | $10$ |\n\nThe company wants to distribute a product to these five cities in such a way that the transportation cost is minimized. The company wants to ensure that City 1 and City 5 each receive at least $100$ units of the product, and the other cities each receive at least $50$ units of the product. Formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem and find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem, we need to define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nLet $x_{ij}$ be the number of units of the product transported from factory $i$ to city $j$. The objective function is to minimize the total transportation cost, which can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\text{Minimize} \\quad Z = 12x_{11} + 7x_{12} + 16x_{13} + 11x_{14} + 9x_{15} + 10x_{21} + 9x_{22} + 15x_{23} + 14x_{24} + 7x_{25} + 7x_{31} + 12x_{32} + 11x_{33} + 9x_{34} + 10x_{35}\n$$\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. City 1 and City 5 each receive at least 100 units of the product:\n\n$$\nx_{11} + x_{21} + x_{31} \\ge 100 \\\\\nx_{15} + x_{25} + x_{35} \\ge 100\n$$\n\n2. City 2, City 3, and City 4 each receive at least 50 units of the product:\n\n$$\nx_{12} + x_{22} + x_{32} \\ge 50 \\\\\nx_{13} + x_{23} + x_{33} \\ge 50 \\\\\nx_{14} + x_{24} + x_{34} \\ge 50\n$$\n\n3. Non-negativity constraints:\n\n$$\nx_{ij} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all} \\quad i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\n$$\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using any optimization software or solver (e.g., Simplex method, graphical method, or software like LINGO, GAMS, or Excel Solver).\n\nThe optimal solution is:\n\n$$\nx_{11} = 0, x_{12} = 50, x_{13} = 0, x_{14} = 0, x_{15} = 100 \\\\\nx_{21} = 100, x_{22} = 0, x_{23} = 50, x_{24} = 0, x_{25} = 0 \\\\\nx_{31} = 0, x_{32} = 0, x_{33} = 0, x_{34} = 50, x_{35} = 0\n$$\n\nThe minimum transportation cost is:\n\n$$\nZ = 12(0) + 7(50) + 16(0) + 11(0) + 9(100) + 10(100) + 9(0) + 15(50) + 14(0) + 7(0) + 7(0) + 12(0) + 11(0) + 9(50) + 10(0) = 350 + 900 + 1000 + 750 + 450 = 3450\n$$\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to transport 100 units from Factory B to City 1, 50 units from Factory A to City 2, 50 units from Factory B to City 3, 50 units from Factory C to City 4, and 100 units from Factory A to City 5, with a minimum transportation cost of $3450."
