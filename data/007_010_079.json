    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can set up a system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N/3 = 105/3 = 35\nN2 = N/5 = 105/5 = 21\nN3 = N/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses:\n\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 3) = 35^(-1) (mod 3) = 2 (since 2 * 35 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 5) = 21^(-1) (mod 5) = 1 (since 1 * 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 7) = 15^(-1) (mod 7) = 1 (since 1 * 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nFinally, we can find the solution:\n\nx = (1 * 35 * 2) + (2 * 21 * 1) + (3 * 15 * 1) = 70 + 42 + 45 = 157\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we need to find the smallest positive integer congruent to 157 modulo 105:\n\nx = 157 (mod 105)\n\nx = 157 - 105 = 52\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 52."
