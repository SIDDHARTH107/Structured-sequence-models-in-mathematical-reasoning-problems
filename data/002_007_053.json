    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 7 cm and its two parallel bases have lengths of 12 cm and 18 cm, respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 7 cm, and the lengths of the parallel bases are 12 cm and 18 cm. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 18) * 7\n\nArea = (1/2) * (30) * 7\n\nArea = 15 * 7\n\nArea = 105 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 105 square centimeters."
