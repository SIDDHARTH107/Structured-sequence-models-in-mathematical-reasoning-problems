    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector a onto vector b using trigonometry, we need to find the angle between the two vectors and then use the dot product formula.\n\nStep 1: Find the angle between the two vectors\nWe can use the dot product formula to find the angle between the two vectors. The dot product of two vectors a and b is given by:\n\na · b = |a| |b| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |a| and |b| are the magnitudes of the vectors a and b, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, we find the magnitudes of the vectors a and b:\n\n|a| = √(6² + 8²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10\n|b| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNext, we find the dot product of the vectors a and b:\n\na · b = (6)(3) + (8)(4) = 18 + 32 = 50\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (a · b) / (|a| |b|)\ncos(θ) = 50 / (10 * 5)\ncos(θ) = 50 / 50\ncos(θ) = 1\n\nθ = cos^(-1)(1) = 0°\n\nStep 2: Find the projection of vector a onto vector b\nNow that we have the angle between the two vectors, we can find the projection of vector a onto vector b using the formula:\n\nproj_b(a) = |a| cos(θ) * (b / |b|)\n\nSince θ = 0°, cos(θ) = 1. So, we have:\n\nproj_b(a) = |a| * (b / |b|)\nproj_b(a) = 10 * ((3, 4) / 5)\nproj_b(a) = 10 * (3/5, 4/5)\nproj_b(a) = (6, 8)\n\nSo, the projection of vector a onto vector b is (6, 8)."
