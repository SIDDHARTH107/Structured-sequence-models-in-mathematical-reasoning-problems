    "message_2": "Let A be the number of students studying English, B be the number of students studying Math, and C be the number of students studying Science. Let X be the number of students studying all three subjects.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nA = 15\nB = 18\nC = 20\nA ∩ B = 8\nB ∩ C = 10\nA ∩ C = 6\n\nWe need to find the value of X.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can write the total number of students (30) as:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A ∩ B) - (B ∩ C) - (A ∩ C) + X\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n30 = 15 + 18 + 20 - 8 - 10 - 6 + X\n30 = 45 - 24 + X\n30 = 21 + X\n\nNow, we can solve for X:\n\nX = 30 - 21\nX = 9\n\nSo, 9 students are studying all three subjects."
