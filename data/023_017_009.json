    "message_1": "Here is a specific numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Fourier transform in fluid dynamics:\n\nSuppose a fluid velocity in the x-direction is given by the periodic function u(x,t) = 2 cos⁡(5x-3t)+3cos⁡(x+2t) in SI units. Use the Fourier transform to determine the amplitude and frequency of each harmonic component for the velocity u(x,t).",
    "message_2": "The given fluid velocity function is u(x,t) = 2cos(5x - 3t) + 3cos(x + 2t). This function is already expressed as a sum of harmonic components, so we do not need to apply the Fourier transform to determine the amplitude and frequency of each component.\n\nThe first harmonic component is 2cos(5x - 3t) and the second harmonic component is 3cos(x + 2t).\n\nFor the first harmonic component:\n- Amplitude: 2\n- Angular frequency in x-direction: 5 (from the coefficient of x)\n- Angular frequency in t-direction: -3 (from the coefficient of t)\n\nFor the second harmonic component:\n- Amplitude: 3\n- Angular frequency in x-direction: 1 (from the coefficient of x)\n- Angular frequency in t-direction: 2 (from the coefficient of t)\n\nSo, the amplitude and frequency of each harmonic component for the velocity u(x,t) are:\n\n1st harmonic component:\n- Amplitude: 2\n- Frequency in x-direction: 5/(2π)\n- Frequency in t-direction: -3/(2π)\n\n2nd harmonic component:\n- Amplitude: 3\n- Frequency in x-direction: 1/(2π)\n- Frequency in t-direction: 2/(2π)"
