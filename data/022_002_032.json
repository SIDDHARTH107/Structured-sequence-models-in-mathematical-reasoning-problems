    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping, we will use a composition of Möbius transformations. Let's denote the unit disk as D and the region enclosed by the curve $|z-1|=2$ as R. We want to find a conformal mapping f(z) such that f(D) = R.\n\nStep 1: Map the unit disk D to the right half-plane.\nWe can use the Möbius transformation $g(z) = \\frac{z+1}{1-z}$ to map the unit disk D to the right half-plane. This transformation maps the points -1, 0, and 1 to 0, 1, and infinity, respectively.\n\nStep 2: Map the right half-plane to the exterior of the circle $|z-1|=2$.\nWe can use the inversion transformation $h(z) = \\frac{4}{z}$ to map the right half-plane to the exterior of the circle $|z-1|=2$. This transformation maps the points 0, 1, and infinity to infinity, 4, and 0, respectively.\n\nStep 3: Map the exterior of the circle $|z-1|=2$ to the region R.\nWe can use the inversion transformation $k(z) = \\frac{4}{z-1}$ to map the exterior of the circle $|z-1|=2$ to the region R. This transformation maps the points infinity, 4, and 0 to 1, 3, and infinity, respectively.\n\nNow, we can find the conformal mapping f(z) by composing the transformations g(z), h(z), and k(z):\nf(z) = k(h(g(z))) = k(h( (z+1)/(1-z) )) = k( 4/((z+1)/(1-z)) ) = 4/( (4(z+1))/((1-z)(z-1)) ) = (4(z+1))/((1-z)(z-1))\n\nSo, the conformal mapping that transforms the unit disk D onto the region R is given by:\n\nf(z) = (4(z+1))/((1-z)(z-1))"
