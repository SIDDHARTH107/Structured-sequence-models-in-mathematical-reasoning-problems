    "message_1": "Here's a mathematical problem in the subject of Combinatorics and the subtopic of Orthogonal arrays:\n\nA chemical company is testing ten different chemical samples for their reaction with four different metals. The company can only afford to test 8 combinations of the chemicals with the metals. They decide to use an orthogonal array with 10 rows, each row representing a different chemical sample, and 4 columns, each column representing a different metal. How many different orthogonal arrays with this setup are possible?\n\nWhat is the answer?",
    "message_2": "An orthogonal array with 10 rows and 4 columns can be represented as OA(10, 4, k, λ), where k is the number of levels (chemical samples) and λ is the index of the array. In this case, k = 10 and λ = 8 since the company can only afford to test 8 combinations.\n\nThe number of different orthogonal arrays can be calculated using the formula:\n\nN(OA(10, 4, k, λ)) = (k^(λ * (t - 1))) / (λ^t)\n\nwhere t is the number of columns (metals) and N(OA(10, 4, k, λ)) represents the number of different orthogonal arrays.\n\nIn this case, t = 4, so the formula becomes:\n\nN(OA(10, 4, 10, 8)) = (10^(8 * (4 - 1))) / (8^4)\n\nN(OA(10, 4, 10, 8)) = (10^24) / (4096)\n\nN(OA(10, 4, 10, 8)) ≈ 2.44 × 10^19\n\nTherefore, there are approximately 2.44 × 10^19 different orthogonal arrays with this setup."
