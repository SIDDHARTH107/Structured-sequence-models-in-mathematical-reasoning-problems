    "message_2": "The Fourier transform is used to decompose a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain components. In this case, the signal S(t) is already given as a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we can directly identify the amplitude and frequency of each component without applying the Fourier transform.\n\nThe signal S(t) is given by:\n\nS(t) = sin(3πt) + sin(5πt) + sin(9πt)\n\nHere, we can see that there are three sinusoidal components:\n\n1. sin(3πt) with amplitude A1 = 1 and frequency f1 = (3π)/(2π) = 1.5 Hz\n2. sin(5πt) with amplitude A2 = 1 and frequency f2 = (5π)/(2π) = 2.5 Hz\n3. sin(9πt) with amplitude A3 = 1 and frequency f3 = (9π)/(2π) = 4.5 Hz\n\nSo, the amplitude and frequency of each component of the signal S(t) are:\n\nComponent 1: Amplitude = 1, Frequency = 1.5 Hz\nComponent 2: Amplitude = 1, Frequency = 2.5 Hz\nComponent 3: Amplitude = 1, Frequency = 4.5 Hz"
