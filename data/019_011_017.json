    "message_1": "Let's say there are 8 books on a shelf, and you want to choose 2 books to read. How many different combinations of books can you choose?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of combinations of choosing 2 books from 8, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items (8 books) and k is the number of items to choose (2 books).\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!6!)\nC(8, 2) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\nC(8, 2) = (8 × 7) / (2 × 1)\nC(8, 2) = 56 / 2\nC(8, 2) = 28\n\nSo there are 28 different combinations of books you can choose."
