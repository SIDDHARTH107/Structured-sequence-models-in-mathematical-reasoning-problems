    "message_1": "A group of 50 individuals were diagnosed with a certain illness. After receiving treatment, the survival times (in months) were recorded for each individual. The table below shows the survival times for the first 10 individuals.\n\n| Individual | Survival Time (months) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | 16 |\n| 2 | 9 |\n| 3 | 23 |\n| 4 | 17 |\n| 5 | 14 |\n| 6 | 7 |\n| 7 | 22 |\n| 8 | 29 |\n| 9 | 11 |\n| 10 | 19 |\n\nAssuming that the survival times follow an exponential distribution, what is the probability that an individual will survive for at least 20 months after treatment?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the parameter λ (lambda) for the exponential distribution. We can estimate λ using the mean of the given survival times.\n\nMean survival time = (16 + 9 + 23 + 17 + 14 + 7 + 22 + 29 + 11 + 19) / 10 = 167 / 10 = 16.7 months\n\nNow, we can estimate λ as the reciprocal of the mean survival time:\n\nλ = 1 / 16.7 ≈ 0.05988\n\nThe probability that an individual will survive for at least 20 months after treatment can be found using the survival function of the exponential distribution, which is given by:\n\nP(T ≥ t) = e^(-λt)\n\nHere, T is the survival time and t is the time we are interested in (20 months in this case).\n\nP(T ≥ 20) = e^(-0.05988 * 20) ≈ e^(-1.1976) ≈ 0.3012\n\nSo, the probability that an individual will survive for at least 20 months after treatment is approximately 30.12%."
