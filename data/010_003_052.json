Define f: X $\\to$ Y by f(1) = 0, f(2) = 1/2, and f(3) = 1.\n\nIs f continuous with respect to the given topologies? \n\nProve your answer.",
    "message_2": "Yes, f is continuous with respect to the given topologies.\n\nProof:\n\nRecall that a function f: X â†’ Y is continuous if for every open set V in Y, the preimage f^(-1)(V) is an open set in X.\n\nSince X has the discrete topology, every subset of X is open. Therefore, we only need to show that for any open set V in Y, f^(-1)(V) is a subset of X.\n\nLet V be an open set in Y. Then f^(-1)(V) is a subset of X, since f^(-1)(V) can only contain elements from X. Since every subset of X is open in the discrete topology, f^(-1)(V) is open in X.\n\nThus, f is continuous with respect to the given topologies."
