    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the finite element method, we will first discretize the domain and approximate the solution u(x, y) using basis functions. Let's consider a uniform mesh with N nodes in each direction (x and y), and let h = 1/(N-1) be the distance between nodes.\n\n1. Discretize the domain: Create a grid of N x N nodes with coordinates (x_i, y_j) where i, j = 0, 1, ..., N-1, and x_i = i * h, y_j = j * h.\n\n2. Define basis functions: We will use bilinear basis functions, which are defined as:\n\nΦ_ij(x, y) = (1 - |x - x_i|/h) * (1 - |y - y_j|/h) for |x - x_i| ≤ h and |y - y_j| ≤ h, and 0 otherwise.\n\n3. Approximate the solution: We will approximate the solution u(x, y) as a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\nu(x, y) ≈ ∑_i ∑_j U_ij * Φ_ij(x, y)\n\nwhere U_ij are the coefficients to be determined.\n\n4. Weak formulation: Multiply the given PDE by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫∫(d²u/dx² + d²u/dy²) * v(x, y) dxdy = ∫∫f(x, y) * v(x, y) dxdy\n\n5. Discretize the weak formulation: Substitute the approximation of u(x, y) into the weak formulation and use the basis functions as test functions:\n\n∑_i ∑_j U_ij * ∫∫(d²Φ_ij/dx² + d²Φ_ij/dy²) * Φ_kl(x, y) dxdy = ∫∫f(x, y) * Φ_kl(x, y) dxdy for all k, l\n\nThis results in a system of linear equations AU = F, where A is the stiffness matrix, U is the vector of coefficients U_ij, and F is the load vector.\n\n6. Solve the linear system: Solve the linear system AU = F for the coefficients U_ij. Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous (u(x, y) = 0 on the boundary), the coefficients corresponding to the boundary nodes will be zero.\n\n7. Compute the numerical solution: Once the coefficients U_ij are obtained, the numerical solution u(x, y) can be computed as:\n\nu(x, y) ≈ ∑_i ∑_j U_ij * Φ_ij(x, y)\n\nBy following these steps, we can obtain the numerical solution for u(x, y) using the finite element method for the given partial differential equation and the function f(x, y) = 2x(1-x)sin(πy) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1. Note that the accuracy of the solution depends on the number of nodes N used in the discretization."
