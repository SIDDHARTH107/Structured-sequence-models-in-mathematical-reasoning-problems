    "message_1": "A trapezoid has bases of length 8 cm and 12 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the bases are 8 cm and 12 cm, and the height is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (8 + 12) * 5\nArea = (1/2) * (20) * 5\nArea = 10 * 5\nArea = 50 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 50 square centimeters."
