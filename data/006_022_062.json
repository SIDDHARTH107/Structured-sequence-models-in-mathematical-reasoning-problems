    "message_1": "In a school of 500 students, there are 300 boys and 200 girls. If the probability of a boy passing his math exam is 0.8, and the probability of a girl passing her math exam is 0.7, what is the probability that a randomly selected student from the school passed their math exam?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student passed their math exam, we can use the law of total probability. We will first find the probability of each gender passing the exam and then find the weighted average based on the proportion of boys and girls in the school.\n\nThe probability of a boy passing the exam is 0.8, and there are 300 boys out of 500 students, so the proportion of boys is 300/500 = 0.6.\n\nThe probability of a girl passing the exam is 0.7, and there are 200 girls out of 500 students, so the proportion of girls is 200/500 = 0.4.\n\nNow, we can find the weighted average:\n\nProbability of passing = (probability of boy passing * proportion of boys) + (probability of girl passing * proportion of girls)\n\nProbability of passing = (0.8 * 0.6) + (0.7 * 0.4)\nProbability of passing = 0.48 + 0.28\nProbability of passing = 0.76\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from the school passed their math exam is 0.76 or 76%."
