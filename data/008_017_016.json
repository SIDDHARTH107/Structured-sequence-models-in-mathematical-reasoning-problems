    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system of equations as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nMatrix A:\n[ 2  3  4 ]\n[ 1  4  1 ]\n[ 3  2 -4 ]\n\nColumn vector x:\n[ x ]\n[ y ]\n[ z ]\n\nColumn vector b:\n[ 15 ]\n[  8 ]\n[ -4 ]\n\nNow, we can represent the matrix A as a sparse matrix. However, since there are no zero elements in matrix A, the sparse representation will not provide any computational advantage in this case. Nevertheless, we can proceed to solve the system of equations using any standard method, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule.\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract 1/2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3/2 times the first row from the third row:\n\nMatrix A:\n[  2   3   4 ]\n[  0   2.5 -1 ]\n[  0  -2.5 -10 ]\n\nColumn vector b:\n[ 15 ]\n[  0.5 ]\n[ -10.5 ]\n\n2. Divide the second row by 2.5, and add the second row to the third row:\n\nMatrix A:\n[  2   3    4  ]\n[  0   1   -0.4 ]\n[  0   0   -9.6 ]\n\nColumn vector b:\n[  15  ]\n[  0.2 ]\n[ -10.7 ]\n\n3. Divide the third row by -9.6, and add 4 times the third row to the first row and 0.4 times the third row to the second row:\n\nMatrix A:\n[  2   3   0 ]\n[  0   1   0 ]\n[  0   0   1 ]\n\nColumn vector b:\n[  17.5 ]\n[  0.9 ]\n[  1.114583333 ]\n\nNow, the matrix A is in row-echelon form, and we can read off the solution directly from the column vector b:\n\nx = 17.5 / 2 = 8.75\ny = 0.9\nz = 1.114583333\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 8.75, y = 0.9, and z â‰ˆ 1.1146."
