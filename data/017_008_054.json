    "message_2": "To determine which group this presentation corresponds to, let's analyze the relations given:\n\n1. $a^4 = 1$: This tells us that the order of the element $a$ is 4.\n2. $b^2 = a^2$: This tells us that the order of the element $b$ is at most 4 since $b^4 = (b^2)^2 = a^4 = 1$.\n3. $bab^{-1} = a^{-1}$: This is a conjugation relation.\n\nNow let's compare this presentation with the presentations of C8, Q8, and D4:\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8 has presentation $\\langle a \\mid a^8 = 1 \\rangle$. This presentation has only one generator, so it cannot be isomorphic to the given presentation with two generators.\n\n2. Q8: The quaternion group of order 8 has presentation $\\langle a, b \\mid a^4 = 1, b^2 = a^2, b^2 = a^2, bab^{-1} = a^{-1} \\rangle$. Comparing this with the given presentation, we can see that they are the same. Therefore, the given presentation corresponds to the quaternion group Q8.\n\n3. D4: The dihedral group of order 8 has presentation $\\langle a, b \\mid a^4 = 1, b^2 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^{-1} \\rangle$. The second relation in this presentation is different from the given presentation, so it cannot be isomorphic to the given presentation.\n\nThus, the given presentation corresponds to the quaternion group Q8."
