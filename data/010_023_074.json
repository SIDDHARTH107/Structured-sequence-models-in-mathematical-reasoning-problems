Suppose that A is homeomorphic to the solid torus (the product of a disk with a circle), B is homeomorphic to a 3-ball, and A and B intersect in exactly one torus knot. Calculate the self-linking number of the torus knot.",
    "message_2": "The self-linking number of a knot is an invariant that measures the linking of a knot with a push-off of itself. For a torus knot, the self-linking number can be computed using the formula:\n\nSelf-linking number = p * q - gcd(p, q)\n\nwhere p and q are the parameters of the torus knot, and gcd(p, q) is the greatest common divisor of p and q.\n\nIn this problem, we are given a closed, orientable 3-dimensional manifold M that is the boundary of the union of two open sets, A and B. A is homeomorphic to the solid torus, and B is homeomorphic to a 3-ball. A and B intersect in exactly one torus knot.\n\nSince A is homeomorphic to the solid torus, it can be parameterized by (p, q), where p and q are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(p, q) = 1). The torus knot is then a (p, q)-torus knot.\n\nUsing the formula for the self-linking number, we have:\n\nSelf-linking number = p * q - gcd(p, q)\n\nSince p and q are coprime, gcd(p, q) = 1. Therefore, the self-linking number of the torus knot is:\n\nSelf-linking number = p * q - 1"
