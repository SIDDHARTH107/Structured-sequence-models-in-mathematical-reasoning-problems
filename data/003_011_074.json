    "message_1": "An airplane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet and spots a boat in the ocean below. The angle of depression of the airplane to the boat is 30 degrees. What is the distance (in feet) between the airplane and the boat? (Assume that the distance between the airplane and the boat is sufficiently large to be considered as a straight line)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have a right triangle with the airplane at the top, the boat at the bottom, and the angle of depression (30 degrees) between them. We are given the altitude of the airplane (10,000 feet) and need to find the distance between the airplane and the boat.\n\nLet's call the distance between the airplane and the boat \"d\" and the horizontal distance between the airplane's vertical projection on the ocean and the boat \"x\". We can use the tangent function to relate the angle, the altitude, and the horizontal distance:\n\ntan(30°) = (10,000 feet) / x\n\nWe know that tan(30°) = 1 / √3, so:\n\n1 / √3 = (10,000 feet) / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (10,000 feet) * √3\n\nx ≈ 17,320.5 feet\n\nNow that we have the horizontal distance, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the airplane and the boat:\n\nd^2 = (10,000 feet)^2 + (17,320.5 feet)^2\n\nd^2 = 100,000,000 + 299,999,460.25\n\nd^2 ≈ 399,999,460.25\n\nd ≈ √399,999,460.25\n\nd ≈ 20,000 feet\n\nSo, the distance between the airplane and the boat is approximately 20,000 feet."
