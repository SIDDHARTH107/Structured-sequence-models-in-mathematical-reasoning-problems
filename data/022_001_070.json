    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\sqrt{z+1}$ from the half-plane $\\{z: \\text{Re}(z) > 0\\}$ to the whole complex plane, we first need to define a branch of the square root function. \n\nLet's use the principal branch of the square root function, which is defined as:\n\n$$\\sqrt{z} = \\sqrt{r}e^{i\\theta/2}$$\n\nwhere $z = re^{i\\theta}$, $r = |z|$, and $-\\pi < \\theta \\leq \\pi$. Now, we can rewrite the function $f(z)$ as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sqrt{z+1} = \\sqrt{(z+1)e^{i\\arg(z+1)}} = \\sqrt{r'}e^{i\\theta'/2}$$\n\nwhere $z+1 = r'e^{i\\theta'}$, $r' = |z+1|$, and $-\\pi < \\theta' \\leq \\pi$.\n\nNow, we want to extend this function to the whole complex plane. To do this, we need to consider the behavior of the function as $z$ approaches the boundary of the half-plane $\\{z: \\text{Re}(z) > 0\\}$, which is the imaginary axis.\n\nAs $z$ approaches the imaginary axis, the argument of $z+1$ approaches $\\pm \\pi$. To analytically continue the function, we need to define the function in such a way that it remains continuous and single-valued as $z$ crosses the imaginary axis.\n\nOne way to do this is to define the function using a Riemann surface, which is a multi-sheeted surface that allows us to smoothly continue the function across branch cuts. For the square root function, we can use a two-sheeted Riemann surface, with the branch cut along the negative real axis of the $z+1$ plane.\n\nTo define the function on the second sheet, we can use the following definition:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sqrt{z+1} = \\sqrt{(z+1)e^{i(\\arg(z+1) + 2\\pi)}} = \\sqrt{r'}e^{i(\\theta' + 2\\pi)/2}$$\n\nNow, as $z$ crosses the imaginary axis, the function smoothly transitions from one sheet to the other, and the analytic continuation is well-defined on the whole complex plane. Note that the function is still multivalued, but it is continuous and single-valued on each sheet of the Riemann surface."
