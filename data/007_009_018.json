    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). To compute the value of φ(n) for a given n, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor the number 24, we first find its prime factors: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1. So, there are two distinct prime factors: 2 and 3.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula:\n\nφ(24) = 24 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(24) = 24 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(24) = 12 * (2/3)\nφ(24) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 24 is 8."
