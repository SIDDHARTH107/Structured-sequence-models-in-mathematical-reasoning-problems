    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. In other words, an automorphism is a bijection f: V(G) → V(G) such that two vertices u and v are adjacent if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent. The set of all automorphisms of a graph G forms a group under composition, called the automorphism group of G, denoted as Aut(G).\n\nLet's consider the graph G with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} and edges {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)}. The graph looks like this:\n\n```\n1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4\n```\n\nNow, let's find the automorphisms of G:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself: f1 = {1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2, 3 ↦ 3, 4 ↦ 4}.\n2. The automorphism that swaps vertices 1 and 4, and vertices 2 and 3: f2 = {1 ↦ 4, 2 ↦ 3, 3 ↦ 2, 4 ↦ 1}.\n\nThese are the only two automorphisms of G since any other permutation of vertices would not preserve the adjacency relation. For example, swapping vertices 1 and 2 would result in the edge (1, 4) being lost and a new edge (2, 4) being created, which is not an automorphism.\n\nTherefore, the automorphism group of G is Aut(G) = {f1, f2}, which is isomorphic to the group Z_2 (the cyclic group of order 2)."
