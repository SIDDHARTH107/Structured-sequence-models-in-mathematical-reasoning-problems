    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring on any of the 5 roads, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring on any of the roads and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring on a single road is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince the roads are independent, the probability of no accidents occurring on all 5 roads is the product of the probabilities of no accident on each road:\n\n0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring on any of the 5 roads:\n\n1 - 0.32768 = 0.67232\n\nSo, the probability of at least one accident occurring on any of the 5 roads in a given day is approximately 0.67232 or 67.23%."
