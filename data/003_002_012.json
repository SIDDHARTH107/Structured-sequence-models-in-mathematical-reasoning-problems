    "message_2": "To find the sine, cosine, and tangent of a 35-degree angle, we can use a calculator or look up the values in a trigonometric table. Here are the approximate values:\n\nsin(35°) ≈ 0.5736\ncos(35°) ≈ 0.8192\ntan(35°) ≈ 0.7002\n\nSo, the sine of a 35-degree angle is approximately 0.5736, the cosine is approximately 0.8192, and the tangent is approximately 0.7002."
