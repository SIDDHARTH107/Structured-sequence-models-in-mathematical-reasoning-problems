    "message_1": "A math student wants to compare the heights (in inches) of two groups of students from different schools. However, the data is not normally distributed, and the student cannot assume equal variances between the groups. Use the Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there is a significant difference in the heights of the two groups. The data is as follows:\n\nGroup A: 62, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 80\nGroup B: 59, 60, 63, 64, 66, 69, 70, 78, 80, 85",
    "message_2": "To perform the Mann-Whitney U test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the two groups and rank the data from smallest to largest.\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group.\n3. Calculate the U statistic for each group.\n4. Determine the critical value for the U statistic.\n5. Compare the calculated U statistic to the critical value to determine if there is a significant difference in the heights of the two groups.\n\nStep 1: Combine and rank the data\n59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 80, 80, 85\n\nRanks:\nGroup A: 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18\nGroup B: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 17, 18, 20\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group\nGroup A: 3 + 6 + 8 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 18 = 116\nGroup B: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 17 + 18 + 20 = 93\n\nStep 3: Calculate the U statistic for each group\nU_A = n_A * n_B + (n_A * (n_A + 1)) / 2 - R_A\nU_B = n_A * n_B + (n_B * (n_B + 1)) / 2 - R_B\n\nWhere n_A and n_B are the number of observations in groups A and B, and R_A and R_B are the sum of the ranks for groups A and B.\n\nU_A = 10 * 10 + (10 * (10 + 1)) / 2 - 116 = 100 + 55 - 116 = 39\nU_B = 10 * 10 + (10 * (10 + 1)) / 2 - 93 = 100 + 55 - 93 = 62\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value for the U statistic\nFor a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and sample sizes of 10 for both groups, the critical value for the Mann-Whitney U test is 23 (you can find this value in a Mann-Whitney U test table).\n\nStep 5: Compare the calculated U statistic to the critical value\nSince both U_A (39) and U_B (62) are greater than the critical value (23), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in the heights of the two groups."
