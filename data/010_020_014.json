    "message_2": "To find the subset $S$ of $\\mathcal{K}$, we need to consider the properties of Heegaard Floer homology and the relationship between knot classes and their crossing numbers.\n\nFirst, recall that Heegaard Floer homology, denoted by $\\text{HF}^+(M)$, is an invariant of a 3-manifold $M$ with a fixed spin$^c$ structure. It is a powerful tool for studying the topology of 3-manifolds and has many applications, including knot theory.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of knot classes $\\mathcal{K}$ in $M$. A knot class is an equivalence class of knots that are related by ambient isotopy. The crossing number of a knot is the minimum number of crossings in any diagram representing the knot. We are interested in finding the subset $S$ of $\\mathcal{K}$ such that each element of $S$ can be represented by a knot that has $d\\cdot \\text{rank}(\\text{HF}^+(M))$ crossings, where $d$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo find the subset $S$, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. Compute the Heegaard Floer homology $\\text{HF}^+(M)$ of the 3-manifold $M$ with the given spin$^c$ structure. This will give us the rank of $\\text{HF}^+(M)$.\n\n2. For each knot class $K$ in $\\mathcal{K}$, find a representative knot $k$ with the minimum crossing number.\n\n3. Check if the crossing number of the representative knot $k$ is equal to $d\\cdot \\text{rank}(\\text{HF}^+(M))$ for some positive integer $d$. If it is, include the knot class $K$ in the subset $S$.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all knot classes in $\\mathcal{K}$.\n\nThe resulting subset $S$ will consist of all knot classes in $\\mathcal{K}$ that can be represented by a knot with $d\\cdot \\text{rank}(\\text{HF}^+(M))$ crossings for some positive integer $d$. Note that this problem can be computationally intensive, especially for large 3-manifolds and complex knot classes. However, the outlined strategy provides a general approach to finding the desired subset $S$."
