    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position function x(t) with respect to time t.\n\nThe position function is given by:\nx(t) = 3t² - 4t + 1\n\nThe first derivative of x(t) with respect to t will give us the velocity function v(t):\nv(t) = dx/dt = d(3t² - 4t + 1)/dt = 6t - 4\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at t = 2 seconds by substituting t = 2 into the velocity function:\nv(2) = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 m/s\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivative of x(t) with respect to t, which will give us the acceleration function a(t):\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t - 4)/dt = 6\n\nSince the acceleration function is a constant, the acceleration at t = 2 seconds is the same as the acceleration at any other time:\na(2) = 6 m/s²\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 8 m/s, and the acceleration is 6 m/s²."
