    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 2x³ - 15x² + 36x, we first need to find the second derivative of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x³ - 15x² + 36x) = 6x² - 30x + 36\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x² - 30x + 36) = 12x - 30\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x where the second derivative is equal to zero:\n12x - 30 = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n12x = 30\nx = 30/12\nx = 5/2\n\nSo, there is one inflection point at x = 5/2. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, plug this value of x back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(5/2) = 2(5/2)³ - 15(5/2)² + 36(5/2)\nf(5/2) = 2(125/8) - 15(25/4) + 90\nf(5/2) = 250/8 - 375/4 + 90\nf(5/2) = 125/4 + 90\nf(5/2) = 125/4 + 360/4\nf(5/2) = 485/4\n\nThus, the inflection point is at (5/2, 485/4)."
