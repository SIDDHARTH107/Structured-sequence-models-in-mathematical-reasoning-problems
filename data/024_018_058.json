    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,2) in the direction of the tangent vectors v and w, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1,2). Then, we will find the angle θ between the tangent vectors v and w. Finally, we will compute the sectional curvature using the formula:\n\nSectional curvature = (K * (v ⋅ w)^2) / (||v||^2 * ||w||^2 - (v ⋅ w)^2)\n\nStep 1: Find the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1,2).\n\nThe surface is given by the equation z = x^2 + y^2. We can rewrite this equation as F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z = 0. Now, we will find the first and second partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nFx = 2x\nFy = 2y\nFz = -1\n\nFxx = 2\nFyy = 2\nFzz = 0\n\nFxy = Fyx = 0\nFxz = Fzx = 0\nFyz = Fzy = 0\n\nNow, we will compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (Fxx * Fyy - Fxy^2) / (Fx^2 + Fy^2 + Fz^2)^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nFx = 2\nFy = 2\nFz = -1\n\nFxx = 2\nFyy = 2\nFxy = 0\n\nK = (2 * 2 - 0^2) / (2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2)^2\nK = 4 / 9\n\nStep 2: Find the angle θ between the tangent vectors v and w.\n\nv = 2i + j - k\nw = i - j + k\n\nv ⋅ w = (2 * 1) + (1 * (-1)) + (-1 * 1) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSince the dot product of v and w is 0, the angle θ between them is 90 degrees or π/2 radians.\n\nStep 3: Compute the sectional curvature.\n\nSince the angle between v and w is 90 degrees, the sectional curvature is simply the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nSectional curvature = K = 4 / 9"
