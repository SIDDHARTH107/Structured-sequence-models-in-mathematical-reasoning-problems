    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral tetrahedron into four smaller equilateral tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of equilateral triangles increases.\n\nIn the first iteration (n=1), there are 4 equilateral triangles (the 4 faces of the original tetrahedron).\nIn the second iteration (n=2), each of the 4 original triangles is replaced by 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 4 * 4 = 16 equilateral triangles.\nIn general, for the nth iteration, there are 4^n equilateral triangles.\n\nSo, for the 5th iteration (n=5), there are 4^5 = 1024 equilateral triangles in the Sierpinski tetrahedron."
