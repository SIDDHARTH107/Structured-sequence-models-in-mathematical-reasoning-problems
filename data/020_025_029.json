    "message_1": "A delivery company has to transport a package from location A to location B. There are 3 possible routes they can take, each with a different distance and cost. Route 1 is 10 km long and costs $20, route 2 is 15 km long and costs $30, and route 3 is 20 km long and costs $40. The company wants to choose the route that minimizes the cost per kilometer. Which route should they take?",
    "message_2": "To determine the route with the lowest cost per kilometer, we need to calculate the cost per kilometer for each route.\n\nRoute 1: $20 / 10 km = $2 per km\nRoute 2: $30 / 15 km = $2 per km\nRoute 3: $40 / 20 km = $2 per km\n\nAll three routes have the same cost per kilometer, which is $2 per km. The company can choose any of the routes as they all have the same cost efficiency."
