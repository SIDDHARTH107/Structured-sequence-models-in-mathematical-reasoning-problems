    "message_2": "A smooth cubic surface in 3-dimensional projective space, also known as a complex projective space, is an algebraic surface defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in four variables. A famous result in algebraic geometry, known as the Cayley-Salmon theorem, states that there are exactly 27 lines on a smooth cubic surface in 3-dimensional projective space.\n\nThis result was first discovered by Arthur Cayley and George Salmon in the 19th century and has since been a fundamental result in the study of algebraic surfaces."
