    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x) = sin(x) at x = π/3 using the central finite difference method with a step size of h = 0.1, we will use the following formula:\n\nf''(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - 2f(x) + f(x - h)) / h^2\n\nHere, x = π/3 and h = 0.1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of f(x + h), f(x), and f(x - h):\n\nf(x + h) = sin(π/3 + 0.1)\nf(x) = sin(π/3)\nf(x - h) = sin(π/3 - 0.1)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf''(π/3) ≈ (sin(π/3 + 0.1) - 2sin(π/3) + sin(π/3 - 0.1)) / 0.1^2\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nf''(π/3) ≈ (sin(1.174532925) - 2sin(1.047197551) + sin(0.919263178)) / 0.01\n\nf''(π/3) ≈ (0.92175127 - 2*0.866025403 + 0.79863551) / 0.01\n\nf''(π/3) ≈ (-0.009663026) / 0.01\n\nf''(π/3) ≈ -0.9663026\n\nTherefore, the second derivative of f(x) = sin(x) at x = π/3 using the central finite difference method with a step size of h = 0.1 is approximately -0.9663026."
