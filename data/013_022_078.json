    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, a player is given an amount of money to split with another player. If the player keeps all the money, they get $X, but if they give the other player some money, they only get $Y. If the other player rejects the offer, both players get $0. Given that X= $40, Y= $20, and the other player will reject any offer less than $10, what amount of money should the player give to maximize their overall earnings?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their overall earnings, the player should give the other player $10. This is because if they give any less than $10, the other player will reject the offer, and both players will get $0. By giving $10, the player will receive $20 (Y = $20), and the other player will accept the offer since it meets their minimum requirement. This way, the player maximizes their earnings while ensuring the other player accepts the offer."
