    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) + cos(x) = 0, we can use the double-angle identity for sine, which is sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So, the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) + cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out cos(x):\n\ncos(x)(2sin(x) + 1) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either cos(x) = 0 or 2sin(x) + 1 = 0.\n\nFor cos(x) = 0, the solutions are x = 90° and x = 270°.\n\nFor 2sin(x) + 1 = 0, we have sin(x) = -1/2. The solutions for this equation are x = 210° and x = 330°.\n\nSo, the solutions for the given equation are x = 90°, 210°, 270°, and 330°."
