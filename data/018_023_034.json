Show that the result is not the same for both calculations, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A Δ B). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. So, A Δ B = {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and B, which is ((A Δ B) Δ B). We have (A Δ B) = {1, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4}. The symmetric difference is {1, 2, 3}.\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and B (B Δ B). Since the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set, we have B Δ B = {}.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B Δ B), which is (A Δ {}). Since the symmetric difference of a set with the empty set is the set itself, we have A Δ {} = A = {1, 2, 3}.\n\nNow, we will find the Cartesian product of the sets ((A Δ B) Δ B) and (A Δ (B Δ B)). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\nThe Cartesian product of ((A Δ B) Δ B) = {1, 2, 3} is:\n{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nThe Cartesian product of (A Δ (B Δ B)) = {1, 2, 3} is:\n{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nAs we can see, the Cartesian products of both symmetric differences are the same. However, this does not mean that the symmetric difference is associative with respect to the Cartesian product. In this specific example, the results happened to be the same, but this is not a general rule. The symmetric difference operation is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product because the order in which the sets are combined can affect the final result."
