Interior of A:\nThe interior of a set A, denoted as Int(A), is the union of all open sets contained in A. In this case, the open sets contained in A are {a}, {b}, and {a, b}. Therefore, the interior of A is the union of these sets:\n\nInt(A) = {a} ∪ {b} ∪ {a, b} = {a, b}\n\n2. Closure of A:\nThe closure of a set A, denoted as Cl(A), is the intersection of all closed sets containing A. A closed set is the complement of an open set. In this topology, the closed sets are {∅, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X}. The closed sets containing A are {a, c}, {b, c}, and X. Therefore, the closure of A is the intersection of these sets:\n\nCl(A) = {a, c} ∩ {b, c} ∩ X = {a, b}\n\n3. Boundary of A:\nThe boundary of a set A, denoted as ∂A, is the difference between the closure of A and the interior of A:\n\n∂A = Cl(A) - Int(A)\n\nFrom our previous calculations, we have Cl(A) = {a, b} and Int(A) = {a, b}. Therefore, the boundary of A is:\n\n∂A = {a, b} - {a, b} = ∅\n\nIn conclusion, for the set A = {a, b} in the topological space X with topology T, we have:\n\n- Interior of A: Int(A) = {a, b}\n- Closure of A: Cl(A) = {a, b}\n- Boundary of A: ∂A = ∅"
