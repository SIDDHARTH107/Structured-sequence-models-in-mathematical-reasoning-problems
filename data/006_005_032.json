    "message_1": "A student spends an average of 15 minutes studying probability every day. What is the probability that the student will study probability for exactly 1 hour (60 minutes) within a 4-day period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, the number of minutes spent studying probability) that occur in a fixed interval of time (in this case, 4 days).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (k minutes of studying) in the given time period\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (minutes) in the given time period\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- k! is the factorial of k (the product of all positive integers up to k)\n\nIn this problem, the student studies for an average of 15 minutes per day, so over a 4-day period, the average number of minutes spent studying probability is:\n\nλ = 15 minutes/day * 4 days = 60 minutes\n\nWe want to find the probability that the student will study for exactly 60 minutes in this 4-day period, so k = 60.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = 60) = (e^(-60) * 60^60) / 60!\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X = 60) ≈ 0.0393\n\nSo the probability that the student will study probability for exactly 1 hour (60 minutes) within a 4-day period is approximately 3.93%."
