    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 4x - 3 > 5x + 2, we'll first isolate the variable x.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4x from both sides of the inequality.\n-3 > x + 2\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality.\n-5 > x\n\nNow we have the inequality -5 > x, which can also be written as x < -5. \n\nTo represent this solution on a number line, draw an open circle at -5 (since x is strictly less than -5, not equal to it) and shade the region to the left of -5.\n\nIn interval notation, the solution is represented as (-âˆž, -5)."
