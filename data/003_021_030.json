    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A • B) / (||A|| ||B||)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors, A • B is the dot product of the vectors, and ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the vectors A and B:\n\nA • B = (3 * -1) + (2 * 4) + (5 * 2) = -3 + 8 + 10 = 15\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n||A|| = √(3^2 + 2^2 + 5^2) = √(9 + 4 + 25) = √38\n||B|| = √((-1)^2 + 4^2 + 2^2) = √(1 + 16 + 4) = √21\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A • B) / (||A|| ||B||) = 15 / (√38 * √21)\n\nθ = arccos(15 / (√38 * √21))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we can use the formula:\n\ndegrees = radians * (180 / π)\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 * (180 / π) ≈ 52.7 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between vector A and vector B is approximately 52.7 degrees, rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree."
