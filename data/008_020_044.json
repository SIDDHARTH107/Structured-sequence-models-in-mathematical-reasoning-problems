    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n2. Perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n3. Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 15 |\n| 5 -6  3 | 10 |\n| 4  7 -9 |  3 |\n\nStep 2: Perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the x terms from the second and third rows. To do this, we can perform the following row operations:\n\nR2 = R2 - (5/2)R1\nR3 = R3 - 2R1\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n|  2   3   4 | 15 |\n|  0 -21 -5 | -25 |\n|  0   1 -17 | -27 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the y term from the third row. To do this, we can perform the following row operation:\n\nR3 = R3 + (1/21)R2\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n|  2   3    4 |  15 |\n|  0 -21  -5 | -25 |\n|  0   0 -356 | -532 |\n\nStep 3: Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nNow that we have the matrix in row-echelon form, we can perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n-356z = -532\nz = -532 / -356\nz = 1.5\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-21y - 5(1.5) = -25\n-21y - 7.5 = -25\n-21y = -17.5\ny = -17.5 / -21\ny = 5/6\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n2x + 3(5/6) + 4(1.5) = 15\n2x + 2.5 + 6 = 15\n2x = 6.5\nx = 3.25\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3.25, y = 5/6, and z = 1.5."
