    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 8 cm and a height of 15 cm. What is its total surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven, radius (r) = 8 cm and height (h) = 15 cm.\n\nTotal Surface Area = 2π(8)² + 2π(8)(15)\nTotal Surface Area = 2π(64) + 2π(120)\nTotal Surface Area = 128π + 240π\nTotal Surface Area = 368π\n\nNow, we can approximate π as 3.14:\n\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 368 × 3.14\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 1155.52 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is approximately 1155.52 cm²."
