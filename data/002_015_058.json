    "message_1": "A circular track has a diameter of 100 meters. What is the perimeter of the track?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular track, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is given as 100 meters, the radius is half of that, which is 50 meters.\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 50\nC ≈ 314.159 * 50\nC ≈ 15707.95\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circular track is approximately 15707.95 meters."
