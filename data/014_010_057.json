    "message_1": "Suppose we have a substitution cipher where each letter of the alphabet is replaced by a distinct number from 1 to 26. If the encrypted message \"10 9 14 18 20\" corresponds to the word \"GREET\", what is the original message before encryption?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to find the relationship between the encrypted numbers and the corresponding letters in the word \"GREET\". We can do this by finding the difference between the letter's position in the alphabet and the encrypted number.\n\nG = 7, and the first number is 10. The difference is 10 - 7 = 3.\nR = 18, and the second number is 9. The difference is 18 - 9 = 9.\nE = 5, and the third number is 14. The difference is 14 - 5 = 9.\nE = 5, and the fourth number is 18. The difference is 18 - 5 = 13.\nT = 20, and the fifth number is 20. The difference is 20 - 20 = 0.\n\nWe can see that the differences are not constant. However, we can try to find a pattern in the differences. The differences are 3, 9, 9, 13, and 0. We can see that the differences are increasing by 6, then staying the same, then increasing by 4, and then decreasing by 13. This pattern can be represented as +6, 0, +4, -13.\n\nNow, we can apply this pattern to the encrypted numbers to get the original letters:\n\n10 - 3 = 7 -> G\n9 - 9 = 0 -> wrap around to 26 -> Z\n14 - 9 = 5 -> E\n18 - 13 = 5 -> E\n20 - 0 = 20 -> T\n\nSo, the original message before encryption is \"GZEET\"."
