    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given time-domain function f(t) = sin(2πt) + 0.5cos(8πt), we can use the following formula for the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf) and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nHowever, since the given function is composed of two simple trigonometric functions, we can find the Fourier transform of each part separately and then add them together.\n\nThe Fourier transform of sin(2πt) is:\nF1(ω) = (j/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)], where δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nThe Fourier transform of 0.5cos(8πt) is:\nF2(ω) = (1/4) * [δ(ω - 8π) + δ(ω + 8π)]\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier transforms of the two parts:\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω)\nF(ω) = (j/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)] + (1/4) * [δ(ω - 8π) + δ(ω + 8π)]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the given time-domain function f(t) = sin(2πt) + 0.5cos(8πt).\n\nTo find the Fourier transform over the frequency range of 0 to 10 Hz, we can convert the angular frequency ω to frequency f by dividing by 2π:\n\nF(f) = (j/2) * [δ(f - 1) - δ(f + 1)] + (1/4) * [δ(f - 4) + δ(f + 4)]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the given function over the frequency range of 0 to 10 Hz."
