    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\nIntersection of A and B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we find the elements that are in A or B but not in their intersection:\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNext, we need to find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and {3, 4, 5}:\n\n(A △ B) = {1, 4}\nC = {3, 4, 5}\nIntersection of (A △ B) and C = {4}\n\nNow, we find the elements that are in (A △ B) or C but not in their intersection:\n\n(A △ B) △ C = {1, 3, 5}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference (A △ B) △ {3, 4, 5} is {1, 3, 5}."
