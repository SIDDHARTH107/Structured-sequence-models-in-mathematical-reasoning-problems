    "message_2": "To find the probability of a car accident occurring on a particular highway in a day, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, car accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (car accidents) in a day\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (car accidents) per day, which is 2 in this case\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (1 car accident in this case)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-2) * 2^1) / 1!\n\nP(X = 1) ≈ (0.13534 * 2) / 1\n\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.27068\n\nSo, the probability of a car accident occurring on a particular highway in a day is approximately 27.07%. Note that the standard deviation is not needed for this calculation, as it is not relevant to the Poisson distribution."
