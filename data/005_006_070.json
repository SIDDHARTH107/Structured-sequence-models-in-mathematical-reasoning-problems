The mean height of the selected students is 65 inches with a standard deviation of 3 inches. Calculate the probability that the average height of the selected students is less than 64 inches, assuming that the population has a normal height distribution.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that the average height of the selected students is less than 64 inches, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we have a sample size (n) of 50 students, a population mean (μ) of 65 inches, and a population standard deviation (σ) of 3 inches. We want to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is less than 64 inches.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The formula for the standard error is:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nSE = 3 / √50 ≈ 0.4243\n\nNext, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 64 inches. The z-score is the number of standard errors away from the population mean. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (64 - 65) / 0.4243 ≈ -2.36\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.36. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability. Using a z-table, we find that the probability of a z-score less than -2.36 is approximately 0.0091.\n\nSo, the probability that the average height of the selected students is less than 64 inches is approximately 0.0091 or 0.91%."
