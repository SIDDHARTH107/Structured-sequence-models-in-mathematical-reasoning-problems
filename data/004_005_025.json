The equation is:\n\ndy/dx = x^2\n\nWe can solve this first-order differential equation by integrating both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(dy) = ∫(x^2 dx)\n\ny(x) = (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the constant C using the given point (1,2):\n\n2 = (1/3)(1)^3 + C\n\n2 = 1/3 + C\n\nC = 2 - 1/3 = 5/3\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(x) = (1/3)x^3 + 5/3"
