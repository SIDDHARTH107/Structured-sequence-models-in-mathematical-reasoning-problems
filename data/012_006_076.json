    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree.\n\nIn graph G, let's find the degree of each vertex:\n\n- Degree of vertex 0: 2\n- Degree of vertex 1: 4\n- Degree of vertex 2: 2\n- Degree of vertex 3: 2\n- Degree of vertex 4: 4\n- Degree of vertex 5: 2\n\nThere are exactly 2 vertices with an odd degree (vertex 1 and vertex 4), and the graph is connected. Therefore, G contains an Eulerian path.\n\nOne possible Eulerian path is: 0 - 1 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 5 - 4"
