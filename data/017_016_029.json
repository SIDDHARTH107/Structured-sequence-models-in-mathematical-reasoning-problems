    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of G, which is of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that n_3 divides the order of G and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Since the order of G is 27, the only possible values for n_3 are 1 and 3. \n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which is P. Since P is of order 27 and is a subgroup of G, it must be the case that P = G. Thus, G is a p-group of order 3^3, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either cyclic of order 27 or isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3, Z_3 × Z_9. If G is cyclic of order 27, we are done. Otherwise, there exists an element in G of order 3, and G is isomorphic to one of the non-cyclic groups mentioned above.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIn this case, there are three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let P, Q, and R be these subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have |P ∩ Q| = |P ∩ R| = |Q ∩ R| = 1. \n\nNow, consider the set X = PQ, which is the set of all products of elements from P and Q. Since |P| = |Q| = 27, we have |X| = 27^2 = 729. However, we know that there are at least 3 elements in X that are equal to the identity element (e) of G: the products of the identity elements of P and Q, P and R, and Q and R. Therefore, there must be at least 726 non-identity elements in X.\n\nSince G has 26 non-identity elements, and X has at least 726 non-identity elements, it must be the case that X = G. Thus, every element in G can be written as a product of elements from P and Q. \n\nLet a be an element of order 3 in P, and let b be an element of order 3 in Q. Then, the order of the element ab is at most 9, since (ab)^9 = a^9b^9 = e. If the order of ab is 9, then G is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_9. If the order of ab is 3, then G is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3. In either case, there exists an element in G of order 3, and G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is cyclic of order 27, or there exists an element in G of order 3 such that G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 27."
