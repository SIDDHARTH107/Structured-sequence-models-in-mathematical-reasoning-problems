    "message_1": "Suppose you have a ciphertext that was encrypted using the Caesar Cipher shifting each letter by 3 positions. You perform a frequency analysis on the ciphertext and discover that the letter \"A\" appears 32 times out of a total of 200 letters. What is the expected frequency of the letter \"A\" in English language text, and what is the expected frequency of the letter \"A\" in the plaintext of this ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "The expected frequency of the letter \"A\" in English language text is approximately 8.2%. This is based on the analysis of a large sample of English texts.\n\nHowever, since the Caesar Cipher shifts each letter by 3 positions, the frequency of the letter \"A\" in the ciphertext actually corresponds to the frequency of the letter \"X\" in the plaintext. To find the expected frequency of the letter \"A\" in the plaintext, we need to analyze the frequency of the letter \"X\" in the ciphertext.\n\nIn the given ciphertext, the letter \"A\" appears 32 times out of 200 letters, which is a frequency of 16% (32/200). Since \"A\" in the ciphertext corresponds to \"X\" in the plaintext, the expected frequency of the letter \"A\" in the plaintext is actually the frequency of the letter \"X\" in English language text.\n\nThe expected frequency of the letter \"X\" in English language text is approximately 0.15%. However, since the ciphertext has a higher frequency of \"A\" (16%) than the expected frequency of \"X\" in English language text (0.15%), it is likely that the plaintext has a higher frequency of the letter \"A\" than the average English text. The exact frequency of the letter \"A\" in the plaintext cannot be determined without more information about the plaintext itself."
