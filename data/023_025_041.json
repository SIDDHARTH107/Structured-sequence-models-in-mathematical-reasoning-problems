    "message_1": "A flat sheet of iron has a thickness of 1cm and a thermal diffusivity of 0.835 cm^2/s. If the sheet is initially at a temperature of 100°C and is suddenly exposed to a cold environment at 0°C, what will be the temperature at a depth of 0.5cm after 10 seconds? Use Fourier transform to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation and its Fourier transform solution. The equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity (0.835 cm²/s in this case).\n\nThe initial condition is T(x,0) = 100°C for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 cm, and the boundary conditions are T(0,t) = T(1,t) = 0°C for t > 0.\n\nWe can solve this problem using the Fourier transform solution, which is given by:\n\nT(x,t) = (100°C) * Σ [ (2 / (2n + 1)) * sin((2n + 1) * π * x) * exp(-α * ((2n + 1)² * π² * t)) ] for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nTo find the temperature at x = 0.5 cm and t = 10 s, we can plug in the values and sum up the first few terms of the series:\n\nT(0.5, 10) ≈ (100°C) * Σ [ (2 / (2n + 1)) * sin((2n + 1) * π * 0.5) * exp(-0.835 * ((2n + 1)² * π² * 10)) ] for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nSumming up the first 10 terms of the series, we get:\n\nT(0.5, 10) ≈ 100 * (0.6366 - 0.0004 + 0.0000 - 0.0000 + 0.0000 - 0.0000 + 0.0000 - 0.0000 + 0.0000 - 0.0000) ≈ 63.62°C\n\nSo, the temperature at a depth of 0.5 cm after 10 seconds is approximately 63.62°C. Note that the more terms you include in the series, the more accurate the result will be. However, the first 10 terms should give a reasonably accurate estimate."
