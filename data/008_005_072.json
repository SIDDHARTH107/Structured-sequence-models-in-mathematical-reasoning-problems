    "message_2": "Given that x = 1.5 and y = -2.5, we can substitute these values into one of the equations to find the value of z. Let's use the third equation:\n\nx + 2y - z = 3\n\nSubstitute the values of x and y:\n\n1.5 + 2(-2.5) - z = 3\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\n1.5 - 5 - z = 3\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n-3.5 - z = 3\n\nNow, isolate z:\n\nz = -3.5 - 3\nz = -6.5\n\nSo, when x = 1.5 and y = -2.5, the value of z is -6.5."
