    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by applying the Koch curve process to each side of an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, every straight line segment is replaced with a Koch curve segment, which consists of 4 smaller segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the number of segments in the Koch snowflake is given by:\n\nNumber of segments = (3 * 4^n), where n is the number of iterations.\n\nNumber of segments = 3 * 4^4 = 3 * 256 = 768\n\nThe length of each segment after 4 iterations is given by:\n\nSegment length = (initial side length) / (3^n), where n is the number of iterations.\n\nSegment length = 1 / (3^4) = 1 / 81\n\nNow, we can find the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after 4 iterations by multiplying the number of segments by the length of each segment:\n\nTotal length = Number of segments * Segment length\n\nTotal length = 768 * (1/81)\n\nTotal length = 768/81 â‰ˆ 9.4815 units"
