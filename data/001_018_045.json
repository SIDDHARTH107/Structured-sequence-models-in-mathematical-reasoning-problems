    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this rule to the given expression:\n\nlog(base 2) 8 - log(base 2) 4 - log(base 2) 2 = log(base 2) (8/4) - log(base 2) 2 = log(base 2) 2 - log(base 2) 2.\n\nNow, we have log(base 2) 2 - log(base 2) 2, which is the same as log(base 2) (2/2) using the quotient rule again. Since 2/2 = 1, the expression simplifies to:\n\nlog(base 2) 1.\n\nFinally, any logarithm with the argument 1 is equal to 0, regardless of the base. Therefore, the simplified expression is:\n\n0."
