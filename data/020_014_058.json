    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^3 - 8x^2 + 10x - 2 in the interval [1, 6] using a non-convex optimization method, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the first derivative of the function to determine the critical points.\n2. Find the second derivative to determine the nature of the critical points (minimum, maximum, or saddle point).\n3. Evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval to find the global minimum.\n\nStep 1: Find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 16x + 10\n\nStep 2: Find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 16x + 10 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two critical points:\n\nx1 ≈ 1.79\nx2 ≈ 1.88\n\nStep 3: Find the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 16\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(x1) ≈ 6(1.79) - 16 ≈ -4.74 (negative, so x1 is a local maximum)\nf''(x2) ≈ 6(1.88) - 16 ≈ 3.28 (positive, so x2 is a local minimum)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(1) = 1 - 8 + 10 - 2 = 1\nf(1.79) ≈ -0.72\nf(1.88) ≈ -0.75\nf(6) = 6^3 - 8(6^2) + 10(6) - 2 = -86\n\nThe global minimum of the function f(x) = x^3 - 8x^2 + 10x - 2 in the interval [1, 6] is -86, which occurs at x = 6."
