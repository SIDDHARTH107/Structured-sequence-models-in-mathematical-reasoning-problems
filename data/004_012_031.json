    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (5x - 2)/(x^2 + 3) using the quotient rule, we first need to identify the numerator function (u) and the denominator function (v). In this case, u(x) = 5x - 2 and v(x) = x^2 + 3.\n\nThe quotient rule states that the derivative of a function f(x) = u(x)/v(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x))/(v(x))^2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(5x - 2)/dx = 5\nv'(x) = d(x^2 + 3)/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (5(x^2 + 3) - (5x - 2)(2x))/(x^2 + 3)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = (5(2^2 + 3) - (5(2) - 2)(2(2)))/((2^2 + 3)^2)\n\nf'(2) = (5(7) - (8)(4))/(7^2)\n\nf'(2) = (35 - 32)/(49)\n\nf'(2) = 3/49\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (5x - 2)/(x^2 + 3) at x = 2 is 3/49."
