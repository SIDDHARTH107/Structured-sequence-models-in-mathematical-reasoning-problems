    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 6x^2 - 18x\nFactor out the common term 6x:\n6x(x - 3)\n\nDenominator: 9x^3 - 27x^2\nFactor out the common term 9x^2:\n9x^2(x - 3)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(6x(x - 3)) / (9x^2(x - 3))\n\nWe can now cancel out the common factors (x - 3) in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(6x) / (9x^2)\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression further by canceling out the common factor x:\n\n6 / 9x\n\nFinally, we can simplify the fraction 6/9 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:\n\n(6 รท 3) / (9 รท 3) = 2 / 3x\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n2 / (3x)"
