    "message_2": "To solve the equation x + y + z = 10 using Abductive logic, you need at least two variables. Abductive logic involves making an educated guess or forming a hypothesis based on the available information. If you have values for two of the variables, you can make an educated guess or form a hypothesis for the third variable to satisfy the equation. For example, if x = 3 and y = 4, you can deduce that z = 3 to satisfy the equation x + y + z = 10."
