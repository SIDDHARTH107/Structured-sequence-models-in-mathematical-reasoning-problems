    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base length of 8cm and a base width of 5cm. The height of the pyramid is 10cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × Base Area × Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the base length and base width:\n\nBase Area = Base Length × Base Width\nBase Area = 8 cm × 5 cm\nBase Area = 40 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × Base Area × Height\nVolume = (1/3) × 40 cm² × 10 cm\nVolume = (1/3) × 400 cm³\nVolume = 133.33 cm³ (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 133.33 cm³."
