    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(L + W)\n\nSince the perimeter is 60 meters, we have:\n\n60 = 2(L + W)\n30 = L + W\n\nNow, we need to express the area of the rectangle in terms of one variable. The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nFrom the perimeter equation, we can solve for W:\n\nW = 30 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (30 - L)\n\nArea = 30L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can use calculus to find the critical points of the area function. Take the derivative of the area function with respect to L:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 30 - 2L\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n0 = 30 - 2L\n2L = 30\nL = 15\n\nNow, substitute this value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 30 - 15\nW = 15\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that will give the maximum area are L = 15 meters and W = 15 meters. This means that the garden is actually a square with side length 15 meters."
