    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the distance from the student to the tower (adjacent side) is 40 meters, and we want to find the height of the tower (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30) = height / 40\n\nTo find the tangent of 30 degrees, you can use a calculator or remember that tan(30) = 1 / sqrt(3) ≈ 0.577.\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\n0.577 = height / 40\n\nheight = 0.577 * 40\n\nheight ≈ 23.08 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tower is approximately 23.08 meters."
