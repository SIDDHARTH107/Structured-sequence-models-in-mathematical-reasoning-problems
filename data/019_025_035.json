    "message_2": "Let's use the formula for work:\n\nWork = Number of Workers × Number of Days\n\nIn the first scenario, we have:\n\nWork = 4 workers × 8 days\n\nNow, we want to find out how many workers are needed to complete the same project in 6 days. Let's call the number of workers needed \"x\". We can set up the equation:\n\nWork = x workers × 6 days\n\nSince the amount of work is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n4 workers × 8 days = x workers × 6 days\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n32 worker-days = 6x worker-days\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nx = 32/6\n\nx ≈ 5.33\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a worker, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 6 workers are needed to complete the project in 6 days."
