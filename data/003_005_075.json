    "message_2": "To find the angle whose sine is 0.6, we can use the inverse sine function, also known as the arcsine function. The notation for this is sin^(-1)(x) or arcsin(x).\n\nSo, we have sin^(-1)(0.6) = angle.\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of the angle in radians:\n\nsin^(-1)(0.6) ≈ 0.6435 radians.\n\nTo convert this value from radians to degrees, we can use the following formula:\n\nangle (in degrees) = angle (in radians) × (180°/π)\n\nangle (in degrees) ≈ 0.6435 × (180°/π) ≈ 36.87°\n\nTherefore, the angle is approximately 36.87°."
