    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA soft drinks company produces cans that are filled with 356 ml of soda. The company suspects that its filling machines are delivering incorrect amounts of soda. The company tests a sample of 50 cans and finds that the sample mean volume is 352 ml with a standard deviation of 4 ml. Assuming that the cans are filled with a normal distribution of soda, does the evidence from the sample suggest that the machines are delivering an incorrect amount of soda? Use a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the machines are delivering an incorrect amount of soda, we will perform a one-sample t-test. We will use the following information:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The machines are delivering the correct amount of soda (μ = 356 ml)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The machines are delivering an incorrect amount of soda (μ ≠ 356 ml)\n\nSample mean (x̄) = 352 ml\nPopulation mean (μ) = 356 ml\nSample standard deviation (s) = 4 ml\nSample size (n) = 50\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (352 - 356) / (4 / √50)\nt = -4 / (4 / 7.071)\nt = -4 / 0.5657\nt ≈ -7.08\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a 5% level of significance and 49 degrees of freedom (n-1). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.0096.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-7.08) is less than the critical t-value (-2.0096), we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is significant evidence to suggest that the machines are delivering an incorrect amount of soda at a 5% level of significance."
