    "message_1": "A math student is given a group of order 16. They are tasked to determine whether the group is isomorphic to C16, D8 or the non-abelian group. The only information given is that the group has exactly 2 elements of order 2. Determine which group the student is working with.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze each group and their elements of order 2.\n\n1. C16: This is the cyclic group of order 16. It has only one element of order 2, which is the element that is half of the order of the group (i.e., 8). So, C16 has only one element of order 2.\n\n2. D8: This is the dihedral group of order 16 (since it has 8 elements and each element has an inverse, the order is 16). In D8, there are 4 elements of order 2: the identity, the 180-degree rotation, and the two reflections that are not 90-degree rotations. So, D8 has 4 elements of order 2.\n\n3. The non-abelian group: Since we are given that the group has exactly 2 elements of order 2, it cannot be C16 or D8. Therefore, the student is working with the non-abelian group."
