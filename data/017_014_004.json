    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 20 that is isomorphic to a non-abelian group. Since the order of G is 20 = 2^2 * 5, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, which is normal in G. The order of H is 5, so H is isomorphic to Z_5 (the cyclic group of order 5).\n\nNow, let K be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. The order of K is 4, so K is either isomorphic to Z_4 or to Z_2 x Z_2 (the cyclic group of order 4 or the Klein four-group, respectively). Since G is non-abelian, K cannot be isomorphic to Z_4, as otherwise G would be a direct product of H and K, which would make G abelian. Therefore, K must be isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_2.\n\nNow, we want to find the total number of subgroups of order 4 in G. Since K is a Sylow 2-subgroup of G and has order 4, any subgroup of order 4 in G must be a conjugate of K. Since H is normal in G, the conjugation action of G on K is the same as the conjugation action of G/H on K. The order of G/H is 20/5 = 4, so G/H is isomorphic to Z_4 or Z_2 x Z_2.\n\nIf G/H were isomorphic to Z_4, then G would be abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, G/H must be isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_2. Since Z_2 x Z_2 has three subgroups of order 2, the conjugation action of G/H on K must have three orbits. However, K itself is one of these orbits (as it is fixed by conjugation by elements of H), so there must be two other orbits, each corresponding to a distinct conjugate of K.\n\nThus, there are a total of 1 (K itself) + 2 (the other two conjugates of K) = 3 subgroups of order 4 in every non-abelian group of order 20."
