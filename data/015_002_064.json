    "message_1": "A butterfly in China flaps its wings and causes a small disturbance in the air, which eventually leads to a tornado in the United States. If the butterfly flaps its wings 120 times in one minute, how many flaps would it take  to cause a tornado in a city 5000 kilometers away? (Assume that the distance traveled by the flapping of wings is directly proportional to the number of flaps)",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that the distance between China and the United States where the tornado occurs is X kilometers. We are given that the butterfly flaps its wings 120 times in one minute to cause a tornado in the United States. We need to find the number of flaps required to cause a tornado in a city 5000 kilometers away.\n\nSince the distance traveled by the flapping of wings is directly proportional to the number of flaps, we can set up a proportion:\n\n120 flaps / X kilometers = Y flaps / 5000 kilometers\n\nWe need to find the value of Y, which represents the number of flaps required to cause a tornado in a city 5000 kilometers away.\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact distance between China and the United States where the tornado occurs (X kilometers). Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact number of flaps (Y) required to cause a tornado in a city 5000 kilometers away."
