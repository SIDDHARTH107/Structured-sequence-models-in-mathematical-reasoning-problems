    "message_1": "A message has been encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, in which each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another letter. The frequency analysis of the ciphertext has revealed that the letter \"p\" occurs 20 times in the message. What is the expected number of times the letter \"e\" (which has the highest frequency of occurrence in the English language) would appear in the message if it had not been encrypted?",
    "message_2": "To determine the expected number of times the letter \"e\" would appear in the message if it had not been encrypted, we need to know the total number of letters in the message and the frequency of \"e\" in the English language.\n\nThe frequency of \"e\" in the English language is approximately 12.7%. However, we don't have enough information to determine the total number of letters in the message. If we knew the total number of letters, we could calculate the expected number of times \"e\" would appear by multiplying the total number of letters by the frequency of \"e\" (12.7%).\n\nFor example, if the message had 100 letters, the expected number of times \"e\" would appear would be:\n\n100 letters * 12.7% = 12.7 times\n\nWithout knowing the total number of letters in the message, we cannot determine the expected number of times \"e\" would appear in the unencrypted message."
