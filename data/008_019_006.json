    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n2(x + 2y + 3z) = 2(4 + 3i)\n1(2x - 3y + 4z) = 1(-3 + 4i)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n2x + 4y + 6z = 8 + 6i\n2x - 3y + 4z = -3 + 4i\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(2x + 4y + 6z) - (2x - 3y + 4z) = (8 + 6i) - (-3 + 4i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n7y + 2z = 11 + 2i\n\nNow, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n3(x + 2y + 3z) = 3(4 + 3i)\n1(3x + 4y + 2z) = 1(2 - 2i)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n3x + 6y + 9z = 12 + 9i\n3x + 4y + 2z = 2 - 2i\n\nNow, subtract the third equation from the first:\n\n(3x + 6y + 9z) - (3x + 4y + 2z) = (12 + 9i) - (2 - 2i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2y + 7z = 10 + 11i\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n7y + 2z = 11 + 2i\n2y + 7z = 10 + 11i\n\nMultiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 7 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n2(7y + 2z) = 2(11 + 2i)\n7(2y + 7z) = 7(10 + 11i)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n14y + 4z = 22 + 4i\n14y + 49z = 70 + 77i\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(14y + 49z) - (14y + 4z) = (70 + 77i) - (22 + 4i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n45z = 48 + 73i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 45:\n\nz = (48 + 73i) / 45\n\nz = (48/45) + (73/45)i\n\nz = 16/15 + 73/45i\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into the equations for y:\n\n7y + 2z = 11 + 2i\n\n7y + 2(16/15 + 73/45i) = 11 + 2i\n\n7y + 32/15 + 146/45i = 11 + 2i\n\n7y = 11 - 32/15 + 2i - 146/45i\n\n7y = (163/15) + (16/45)i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\ny = (163/105) + (16/315)i\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of y and z back into the equation for x:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 4 + 3i\n\nx + 2((163/105) + (16/315)i) + 3(16/15 + 73/45i) = 4 + 3i\n\nx = 4 - 3i - 2((163/105) + (16/315)i) - 3(16/15 + 73/45i)\n\nx = 4 - 3i - (326/105) - (32/315)i - (48/15) - (219/45)i\n\nx = (4 - 326/105 - 48/15) + (-3 - 32/315 - 219/45)i\n\nx = (-22/105) + (46/315)i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -22/105 + 46/315i\ny = 163/105 + 16/315i\nz = 16/15 + 73/45i"
