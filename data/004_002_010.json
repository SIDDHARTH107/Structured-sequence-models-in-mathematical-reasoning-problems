    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function (x^2 - 1)/(x-1) as x approaches 1, we can first try to simplify the function. We notice that the numerator is a difference of squares, so we can factor it:\n\nx^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\n\nNow the function becomes:\n\n((x - 1)(x + 1))/(x - 1)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 1) terms:\n\n(x + 1)\n\nNow the function is simplified to x + 1. To find the limit as x approaches 1, we can simply plug in 1 for x:\n\n1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the limit of the function (x^2 - 1)/(x-1) as x approaches 1 is 2."
