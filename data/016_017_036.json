    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve after each iteration can be determined using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (sqrt(2))^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after the 7th iteration (n = 7). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2))^7\n\nLength ≈ 1 * 5.656854249\n\nLength ≈ 5.656854249\n\nSo, the length of the 7th iteration of the Heighway dragon curve with an initial line segment of length 1 is approximately 5.656854249 units."
