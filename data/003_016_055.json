    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 2sin(3x - π/6). To find the phase shift, we need to look at the argument of the sine function, which is (3x - π/6) in this case.\n\nThe general form of a sine function with phase shift is sin(B(x - C)), where B is the coefficient of x and C is the phase shift. In our case, B = 3 and the argument is (3x - π/6). We can rewrite this argument as 3(x - π/18) by factoring out the 3.\n\nNow we can see that the phase shift C is π/18. Since the phase shift is positive, the function is shifted to the right by π/18 units."
