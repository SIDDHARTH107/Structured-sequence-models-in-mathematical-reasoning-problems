    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept, we need to find the value of x when y = 0. So, we'll set y to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = |2x - 4|\n\nThere are two cases to consider since the absolute value can be positive or negative:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: -(2x - 4) = 0\n2x - 4 = 0 (same as case 1)\n\nSo, there is only one x-intercept, which is x = 2. The point is (2, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to find the value of y when x = 0. So, we'll set x to 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = |2(0) - 4|\ny = |-4|\ny = 4\n\nSo, the y-intercept is y = 4. The point is (0, 4).\n\nIn summary, the x-intercept is (2, 0) and the y-intercept is (0, 4)."
