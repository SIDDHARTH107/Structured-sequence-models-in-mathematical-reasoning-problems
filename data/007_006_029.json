    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 208 and 364 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (364) by the smaller number (208) and find the remainder.\n   364 รท 208 = 1 with a remainder of 156\n\n2. Replace the larger number (364) with the smaller number (208), and the smaller number with the remainder (156).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 208 and 156.\n\n3. Repeat the process:\n   208 รท 156 = 1 with a remainder of 52\n\n4. Replace the numbers again:\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 156 and 52.\n\n5. Repeat the process:\n   156 รท 52 = 3 with a remainder of 0\n\n6. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 52.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 208 and 364 is 52."
