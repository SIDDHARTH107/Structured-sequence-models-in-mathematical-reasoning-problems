    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of the tangent bundle $T^2$ over the 2-dimensional torus $T^2$, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic of a vector bundle is the product of the Euler characteristic of the base space and the Euler characteristic of the fiber.\n\nThe base space is the 2-dimensional torus $T^2$, which is the product of two circles $S^1 \\times S^1$. The Euler characteristic of a circle $S^1$ is 0, so the Euler characteristic of the torus $T^2$ is 0 * 0 = 0.\n\nThe fiber of the tangent bundle is a 2-dimensional vector space, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The Euler characteristic of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is 1.\n\nNow, we can find the Euler characteristic of the tangent bundle $T^2$ over the 2-dimensional torus $T^2$ by multiplying the Euler characteristic of the base space and the Euler characteristic of the fiber:\n\nEuler characteristic of $T^2$ = Euler characteristic of base space * Euler characteristic of fiber = 0 * 1 = 0.\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the tangent bundle $T^2$ over the 2-dimensional torus $T^2$ is 0."
