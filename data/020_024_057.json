The company has a fixed cost of 200, and the variable cost is 20 per unit. What is the optimal price and quantity that the company should sell its product to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price and quantity that the company should sell its product to maximize profit, we need to first find the profit function. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.\n\nTotal revenue (TR) is the product of price (P) and quantity (Q): TR = P * Q\nTotal cost (TC) is the sum of fixed cost (FC) and variable cost (VC): TC = FC + VC * Q\n\nGiven the demand function P = 60 - 0.5Q, we can substitute P into the total revenue equation:\nTR = (60 - 0.5Q) * Q = 60Q - 0.5Q^2\n\nThe fixed cost is 200, and the variable cost is 20 per unit, so the total cost equation is:\nTC = 200 + 20Q\n\nNow we can find the profit function (π) by subtracting total cost from total revenue:\nπ(Q) = TR - TC = (60Q - 0.5Q^2) - (200 + 20Q) = -0.5Q^2 + 40Q - 200\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative with respect to Q and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ(Q)/dQ = -Q + 40 = 0\n\nSolving for Q, we get:\nQ = 40\n\nNow we can find the optimal price by substituting the optimal quantity into the demand function:\n\nP = 60 - 0.5(40) = 60 - 20 = 40\n\nSo, the optimal price is $40 per unit, and the optimal quantity is 40 units to maximize profit."
