    "message_2": "First, we can eliminate x from the second equation by subtracting twice the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(4x + 2y) - 2(2x + 3y) = 8 - 2(7)\n4x + 2y - 4x - 6y = -6\n-4y = -6\n\nNow, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by -4:\n\ny = -6 / -4\ny = 3/2\n\nNext, we can substitute the value of y back into the first equation to solve for x:\n\n2x + 3(3/2) = 7\n2x + 9/2 = 7\n\nTo solve for x, first subtract 9/2 from both sides:\n\n2x = 7 - 9/2\n2x = (14 - 9)/2\n2x = 5/2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = (5/2) / 2\nx = 5/4\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 5/4 and y = 3/2."
