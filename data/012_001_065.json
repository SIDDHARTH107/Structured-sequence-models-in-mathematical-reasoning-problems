    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node F using Dijkstra's algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node A as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (initially node A) and mark it as visited.\n\n3. Update the distances to its neighbors by adding the distance to the current node and the edge weight. If the new distance is smaller than the previous distance, update the distance.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node F is visited.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E, F}\n   Distances: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞, E=∞, F=∞\n\n2. Visit node A (smallest distance):\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E, F}\n   Distances: A=0, B=9, C=5, D=∞, E=∞, F=∞\n\n3. Visit node C (smallest distance):\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, D, E, F}\n   Distances: A=0, B=6, C=5, D=15, E=7, F=∞\n\n4. Visit node B (smallest distance):\n   Unvisited nodes: {D, E, F}\n   Distances: A=0, B=6, C=5, D=8, E=7, F=∞\n\n5. Visit node E (smallest distance):\n   Unvisited nodes: {D, F}\n   Distances: A=0, B=6, C=5, D=8, E=7, F=10\n\n6. Visit node D (smallest distance):\n   Unvisited nodes: {F}\n   Distances: A=0, B=6, C=5, D=8, E=7, F=10\n\nSince the target node F is the only unvisited node left, the shortest path from node A to node F has a length of 10."
