    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = (z+3)/(z-2) centered at z = -1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z+1). Let w = z + 1, then z = w - 1. Substitute this into the function:\n\nf(w) = ((w-1)+3)/(w-1-2) = (w+2)/(w-3)\n\nNow, we can use partial fraction decomposition to rewrite the function as the sum of two simpler functions:\n\nf(w) = (w+2)/(w-3) = A/(w-3) + B\n\nTo find A and B, we clear the denominator:\n\nA + B(w-3) = w+2\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by equating coefficients:\n\nA = 1 (coefficient of w)\nB = 1 (constant term)\n\nSo, f(w) = 1/(w-3) + 1\n\nNow we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\n1/(w-3) = -1/3 * 1/(1 - (-w/3))\n1/(w-3) = -1/3 * Σ((-w/3)^n) for n = 0 to infinity\n\n1 = Σ(1^0) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we can combine these two series to get the Laurent series expansion of f(w):\n\nf(w) = -1/3 * Σ((-w/3)^n) + Σ(1^0) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nFinally, we substitute z back in place of w:\n\nf(z) = -1/3 * Σ((-(z+1)/3)^n) + Σ(1^0) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nThe regions of convergence for the Laurent series expansion are determined by the singularities of the original function. The original function has a singularity at z = 2, which corresponds to a distance of 3 units from the center of the expansion (z = -1). Therefore, the region of convergence is |z+1| < 3, or -4 < z < 2."
