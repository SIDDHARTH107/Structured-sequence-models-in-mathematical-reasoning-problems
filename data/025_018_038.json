    "message_2": "To find the intersection multiplicity of $C$ and $L$ at point $P$, we will first find the intersection points of $C$ and $L$.\n\nSince $L$ is given by $Z=0$, we can substitute this into the equation for $C$:\n\n$X^4 + Y^3 + 0^2 = X^4 + Y^3 = 0$\n\nNow, we can find the intersection points by solving this equation. We can see that $P = (1:0:0)$ is an intersection point since $1^4 + 0^3 = 1 + 0 = 1$. To find other intersection points, we can factor the equation:\n\n$X^4 + Y^3 = X^4(1 + \\frac{Y^3}{X^4}) = X^4(1 + (\\frac{Y}{X^{4/3}})^3) = 0$\n\nSince this is a projective plane, we can't have $X=0$. So, the other intersection points must satisfy:\n\n$1 + (\\frac{Y}{X^{4/3}})^3 = 0$\n\n$(\\frac{Y}{X^{4/3}})^3 = -1$\n\nLet $t = \\frac{Y}{X^{4/3}}$. Then, we have:\n\n$t^3 = -1$\n\n$t = \\sqrt[3]{-1}$\n\nThere are three complex cube roots of $-1$, given by:\n\n$t = e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{3}}, e^{\\pi i}, e^{\\frac{5\\pi i}{3}}$\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding $Y$ and $Z$ values for each $t$:\n\n1. $t = e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{3}}$\n\n$Y = X^{4/3} e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{3}}$\n\n$Z = 0$\n\n2. $t = e^{\\pi i}$\n\n$Y = X^{4/3} e^{\\pi i}$\n\n$Z = 0$\n\n3. $t = e^{\\frac{5\\pi i}{3}}$\n\n$Y = X^{4/3} e^{\\frac{5\\pi i}{3}}$\n\n$Z = 0$\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection multiplicity at point $P = (1:0:0)$. Since the equation $X^4 + Y^3 = 0$ has a triple root at $Y=0$, the intersection multiplicity at point $P$ is 3.\n\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{mult}_P(C \\cap L) = 3$."
