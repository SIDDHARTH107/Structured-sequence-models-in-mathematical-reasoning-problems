    "message_2": "To find the volume of the sphere inscribed inside a cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere. Since the sphere touches all six faces of the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Edge length of the cube = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nThe formula for the volume (V) of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nSubstitute the radius (r = 5 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5 cm)³\n\nV = (4/3)π(125 cm³)\n\nV = (500/3)π cm³\n\nV ≈ 523.6 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed inside the cube with an edge length of 10 cm is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
