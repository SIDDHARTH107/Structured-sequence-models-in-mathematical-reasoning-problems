    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of homogeneous polynomials in $S$ of degree $n$, we need to count the number of linearly independent monomials of degree $n$. Since we are working in the quotient ring, we need to take into account the relation $yx = qxy$. \n\nLet's first consider the monomials in $x$ and $y$. A monomial of degree $n$ can be written as $x^a y^b$ where $a + b = n$. There are $n + 1$ such monomials, namely $x^n, x^{n-1}y, x^{n-2}y^2, \\dots, xy^{n-1}, y^n$. \n\nNow, we need to account for the relation $yx = qxy$. Using this relation, we can rewrite any monomial of the form $x^a y^b$ with $a \\geq 1$ and $b \\geq 1$ as $q x^{a-1} y^{b+1}$. This means that any monomial of the form $x^a y^b$ with $a \\geq 1$ and $b \\geq 1$ can be expressed as a linear combination of monomials of the form $x^a y^0$ or $x^0 y^b$. \n\nTherefore, the linearly independent monomials of degree $n$ are $x^n, y^n$ and all monomials of the form $x^a y^0$ or $x^0 y^b$ with $a + b = n$. There are $n - 1$ such monomials, namely $x^{n-1}, x^{n-2}, \\dots, x^1, y^1, y^2, \\dots, y^{n-1}$. \n\nSo, the dimension of the space of homogeneous polynomials in $S$ of degree $n$ is $2 + (n - 1) = n + 1$."
