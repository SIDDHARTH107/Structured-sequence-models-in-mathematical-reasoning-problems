    "message_2": "The treewidth of a graph is a measure of how tree-like the graph is. It is defined as the minimum size of the largest clique in a tree decomposition of the graph minus one.\n\nA tree decomposition of a graph is a tree where each node is a subset of vertices of the graph, and the following conditions hold:\n\n1. The union of all subsets is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge in the graph, there exists a subset containing both its endpoints.\n3. If a vertex is in two subsets, then it must be in all subsets on the path between those two subsets in the tree.\n\nFor the given graph, we can construct a tree decomposition as follows:\n\n       {2, 6}\n         |\n       {1, 2}\n         |\n       {2, 3}\n         |\n       {3, 4}\n         |\n       {4, 5}\n         |\n       {4, 7}\n\nIn this tree decomposition, the largest clique has size 2. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph is 2 - 1 = 1."
