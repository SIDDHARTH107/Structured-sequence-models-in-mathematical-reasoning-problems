The production rate for each machine and product is given in the following table:\n\n| Machine/Product | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Machine 1 | 5 | 8 | 7 |\n| Machine 2 | 3 | 6 | 5 |\n| Machine 3 | 4 | 3 | 8 |\n\nAssuming each machine can only be assigned to one product at a time, what is the maximum total production rate that can be achieved by the factory?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum total production rate, we need to assign each machine to the product it can produce the fastest, without assigning the same product to more than one machine. We can do this by analyzing the table and making the best choices for each machine.\n\nFirst, let's find the highest production rate for each product:\n\nProduct 1: Machine 1 produces at a rate of 5 units/hour.\nProduct 2: Machine 1 produces at a rate of 8 units/hour.\nProduct 3: Machine 3 produces at a rate of 8 units/hour.\n\nNow, let's assign each machine to the product it produces the fastest:\n\nMachine 1: Assign to Product 2 (8 units/hour)\nMachine 2: Assign to Product 1 (3 units/hour)\nMachine 3: Assign to Product 3 (8 units/hour)\n\nWith these assignments, the total production rate is:\n\nTotal Production Rate = (Machine 1 rate) + (Machine 2 rate) + (Machine 3 rate)\nTotal Production Rate = 8 + 3 + 8\nTotal Production Rate = 19 units/hour\n\nSo, the maximum total production rate that can be achieved by the factory is 19 units per hour."
