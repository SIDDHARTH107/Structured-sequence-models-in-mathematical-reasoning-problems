    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the third equation to get rid of the fraction:\n\n3x + 2y + z = 14\n2x - 4y + 3z = 2\n-2x + y - 2z = -10\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third equations:\n\nAdd (2/3) times the first equation to the second equation:\n(2/3)(3x + 2y + z) = (2/3)(14)\n2x + 4/3y + 2/3z = 28/3\n\nNow subtract the new second equation from the original second equation:\n(2x - 4y + 3z) - (2x + 4/3y + 2/3z) = 2 - 28/3\n-16/3y + 7/3z = -22/3\n\nMultiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the third equation:\n2(3x + 2y + z) = 2(14)\n6x + 4y + 2z = 28\n\nNow subtract the new third equation from the original third equation:\n(-2x + y - 2z) - (6x + 4y + 2z) = -10 - 28\n-8x - 3y - 4z = -38\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third equation:\n\nDivide the second equation by (-16/3) to simplify it:\ny - (7/16)z = 11/8\n\nNow multiply the new second equation by -3 and add it to the third equation:\n-3(y - (7/16)z) = -3(11/8)\n-3y + (21/16)z = -33/8\n\nNow subtract the new third equation from the original third equation:\n(-8x - 3y - 4z) - (-3y + (21/16)z) = -38 - (-33/8)\n-8x - 4z = -271/8\n\nStep 3: Solve for z:\n\nDivide the third equation by -8:\nx + 1/2z = 271/64\n\nNow solve for z:\nz = 2x - 271/32\n\nStep 4: Substitute z back into the second equation and solve for y:\n\ny - (7/16)(2x - 271/32) = 11/8\ny = 11/8 + (7/8)(2x - 271/32)\ny = 11/8 + (7/4)x - 949/64\n\nStep 5: Substitute y and z back into the first equation and solve for x:\n\n3x + 2(11/8 + (7/4)x - 949/64) + (2x - 271/32) = 14\n3x + 11/4 + (7/2)x - 949/32 + 2x - 271/32 = 14\n\nCombine like terms:\n(25/2)x = 1205/32\n\nDivide by (25/2):\nx = 1205/32 * 2/25\nx = 241/25\n\nNow substitute x back into the expressions for y and z:\n\ny = 11/8 + (7/4)(241/25) - 949/64\ny = 11/8 + 1687/100 - 949/64\ny = 193/100\n\nz = 2(241/25) - 271/32\nz = 482/25 - 271/32\nz = 109/50\n\nSo the solution is:\nx = 241/25\ny = 193/100\nz = 109/50"
