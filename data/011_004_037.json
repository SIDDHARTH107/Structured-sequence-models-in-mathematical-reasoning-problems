    "message_2": "First, let's identify the consonants and vowels in the word \"MATHS\". The consonants are M, T, H, and S, and the vowel is A.\n\nSince the consonants must appear together and the vowels must appear together, we can treat the group of consonants as a single unit (C) and the group of vowels as a single unit (V). So, we have two units: CV or VC.\n\nNow, let's consider the arrangements within each unit:\n\n1. Consonants (M, T, H, S): There are 4 consonants, so there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange them.\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways\n\n2. Vowels (A): There is only 1 vowel, so there is only 1 way to arrange it.\n\nNow, we have two possible arrangements for the units (CV and VC) and 24 ways to arrange the consonants within the consonant unit. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"MATHS\" such that the consonants appear together and the vowels appear together is:\n\n2 (arrangements of units) × 24 (arrangements of consonants) = 48 ways."
