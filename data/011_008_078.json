    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we have n = 10 employees and k = 3 teams.\n\nUsing Stirling numbers of the second kind, we can find the number of ways to split the 10 employees into 3 teams with at least 2 members in each team:\n\nS(10, 3) = (1/6) * (3^10 - 3 * 2^10 + 3) = (1/6) * (59049 - 3072 + 3) = (1/6) * 55980 = 9330\n\nSo there are 9,330 ways to split the 10 employees into 3 teams with at least 2 members in each team."
