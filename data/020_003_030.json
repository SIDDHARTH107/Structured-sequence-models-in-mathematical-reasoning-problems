    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit of A is $15 and the profit per unit of B is $25. The company has 300 units of production capacity and it takes 4 hours to produce 1 unit of A and 3 hours to produce 1 unit of B. The company can work for no more than 800 hours in total. How many units of A and B should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 300\n2. Time constraint: 4x + 3y ≤ 800\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 15x + 25y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the time constraint for y:\n\n3y ≤ 800 - 4x\ny ≤ (800 - 4x) / 3\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n1. x + y = 300\n2. y = (800 - 4x) / 3\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first equation:\n\nx + (800 - 4x) / 3 = 300\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3x + 800 - 4x = 900\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = 100\n\nNow, substitute x back into the first equation to find y:\n\n100 + y = 300\ny = 200\n\nSo, the feasible region has only one vertex at (100, 200).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at this vertex:\n\nP(100, 200) = 15(100) + 25(200) = 1500 + 5000 = 6500\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 100 units of product A and 200 units of product B to maximize its profit, which will be $6,500."
