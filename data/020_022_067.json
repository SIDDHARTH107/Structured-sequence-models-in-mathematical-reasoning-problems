The company wishes to maximize the number of ads while staying within their budget. How many ads of each type should the company place to make their advertising campaign most effective?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of newspaper ads and y be the number of television ads. The company's budget constraint can be represented by the equation:\n\n100x + 500y ≤ 10,000\n\nThe company wants to maximize the total number of ads, which can be represented by the equation:\n\nTotal Ads = x + y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the method of integer linear programming. However, we can also solve this problem by analyzing the constraints and finding the maximum number of ads that can be placed within the budget.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of newspaper ads that can be placed within the budget:\n\n100x ≤ 10,000\nx ≤ 100\n\nSo, the maximum number of newspaper ads is 100. Now, let's find the maximum number of television ads that can be placed within the budget:\n\n500y ≤ 10,000\ny ≤ 20\n\nSo, the maximum number of television ads is 20.\n\nNow, we need to find the combination of newspaper and television ads that maximizes the total number of ads while staying within the budget. We can start by assuming that the company places the maximum number of newspaper ads (100) and then see how many television ads can be placed within the remaining budget:\n\n100 * 100 + 500y ≤ 10,000\n10,000 + 500y ≤ 10,000\n500y ≤ 0\ny ≤ 0\n\nIn this case, no television ads can be placed. Now, let's try reducing the number of newspaper ads and see if we can place more television ads:\n\n99 * 100 + 500y ≤ 10,000\n9,900 + 500y ≤ 10,000\n500y ≤ 100\ny ≤ 0.2\n\nIn this case, we still cannot place any television ads. We can continue this process until we find a combination that allows for both newspaper and television ads:\n\n95 * 100 + 500y ≤ 10,000\n9,500 + 500y ≤ 10,000\n500y ≤ 500\ny ≤ 1\n\nSo, if the company places 95 newspaper ads, they can also place 1 television ad. This combination gives a total of 96 ads, which is the maximum number of ads that can be placed within the budget.\n\nTherefore, the company should place 95 newspaper ads and 1 television ad to make their advertising campaign most effective."
