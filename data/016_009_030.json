    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon Curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = initial_length * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations and initial_length is the length of the starting line segment.\n\nIn this case, the initial_length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 10th iteration (n = 10).\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\nLength = 1 * 32\nLength = 32 units\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon Curve after the 10th iteration is 32 units."
