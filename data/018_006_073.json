    "message_1": "Let U be the universe of integers from -10 to 10. Let A be the set of all even integers in U. Find the complement of A in U and prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the set A, which consists of all even integers in U. Since U is the universe of integers from -10 to 10, we have:\n\nA = {-10, -8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A in U, which we will call A'. A' consists of all the integers in U that are not in A. Therefore, A' is the set of all odd integers in U:\n\nA' = {-9, -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the union of A and A' is equal to U. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either one of the sets or in both. In this case, since A and A' have no common elements (A has all even integers and A' has all odd integers), the union of A and A' will simply be the combination of all elements in A and A':\n\nA âˆª A' = {-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nComparing this set to U, we can see that they are identical:\n\nU = {-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThus, we have proven that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to U."
