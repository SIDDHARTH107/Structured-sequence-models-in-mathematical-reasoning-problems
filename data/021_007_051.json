    "message_1": "Consider the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1. Use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root accurate to 3 decimal places if the initial approximation is x0 = 2.",
    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then apply the iterative formula:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nwhere x0 is the initial approximation and x1 is the next approximation.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 3\n\nNow, let's apply the Newton-Raphson method with the initial approximation x0 = 2:\n\nx1 = 2 - (f(2) / f'(2))\nx1 = 2 - ((2^3 - 4(2^2) + 3(2) + 1) / (3(2^2) - 8(2) + 3))\nx1 = 2 - ((8 - 16 + 6 + 1) / (12 - 16 + 3))\nx1 = 2 - (-1 / -1)\nx1 = 2 - 1\nx1 = 1\n\nNow, we need to check if the approximation is accurate to 3 decimal places. If not, we will repeat the process using x1 as the new initial approximation.\n\nx2 = x1 - (f(x1) / f'(x1))\nx2 = 1 - (f(1) / f'(1))\nx2 = 1 - ((1^3 - 4(1^2) + 3(1) + 1) / (3(1^2) - 8(1) + 3))\nx2 = 1 - ((1 - 4 + 3 + 1) / (3 - 8 + 3))\nx2 = 1 - (1 / -2)\nx2 = 1 + 0.5\nx2 = 1.5\n\nWe will continue the process until the difference between two consecutive approximations is less than 0.001:\n\nx3 = x2 - (f(x2) / f'(x2))\nx3 = 1.5 - (f(1.5) / f'(1.5))\nx3 = 1.5 - ((1.5^3 - 4(1.5^2) + 3(1.5) + 1) / (3(1.5^2) - 8(1.5) + 3))\nx3 = 1.5 - ((3.375 - 9 + 4.5 + 1) / (6.75 - 12 + 3))\nx3 = 1.5 - (-0.125 / -2.25)\nx3 ≈ 1.444\n\nThe difference between x2 and x3 is 0.056, which is still greater than 0.001. We will continue the process:\n\nx4 = x3 - (f(x3) / f'(x3))\nx4 ≈ 1.444 - (f(1.444) / f'(1.444))\nx4 ≈ 1.444 - ((1.444^3 - 4(1.444^2) + 3(1.444) + 1) / (3(1.444^2) - 8(1.444) + 3))\nx4 ≈ 1.444 - (-0.003 / -0.053)\nx4 ≈ 1.437\n\nThe difference between x3 and x4 is 0.007, which is still greater than 0.001. We will continue the process:\n\nx5 = x4 - (f(x4) / f'(x4))\nx5 ≈ 1.437 - (f(1.437) / f'(1.437))\nx5 ≈ 1.437 - ((1.437^3 - 4(1.437^2) + 3(1.437) + 1) / (3(1.437^2) - 8(1.437) + 3))\nx5 ≈ 1.437 - (0.0001 / -0.002)\nx5 ≈ 1.437 + 0.05\nx5 ≈ 1.437\n\nThe difference between x4 and x5 is less than 0.001, so we can conclude that the root accurate to 3 decimal places is approximately x ≈ 1.437."
