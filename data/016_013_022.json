    "message_2": "The exact Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski carpet, there are N = 8 self-similar pieces (since one of the nine smaller squares is removed at each step), and the scaling factor is S = 3 (since each side is divided into three equal parts).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(8) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.8928\n\nThus, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet is approximately 1.8928."
