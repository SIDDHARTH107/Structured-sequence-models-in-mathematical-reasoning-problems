    "message_1": "If the lengths of the parallel bases of a trapezium are 6 cm and 10 cm respectively, and the height is 8 cm, what is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides (the non-parallel sides). Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of a and b. Since the height is perpendicular to the parallel bases, we can form two right triangles by drawing the height from one vertex of the smaller base to the larger base.\n\nLet's consider the right triangle formed with side a. The height (8 cm) is one leg of the triangle, and the difference between the two bases (10 cm - 6 cm = 4 cm) divided by 2 is the other leg (since the height bisects the difference in base lengths). So, we have:\n\na^2 = 8^2 + (4/2)^2\na^2 = 64 + 4\na^2 = 68\na = √68\n\nNow, let's consider the right triangle formed with side b. The height (8 cm) is one leg of the triangle, and the sum of half the difference between the two bases (4/2 = 2 cm) and half the smaller base (6/2 = 3 cm) is the other leg. So, we have:\n\nb^2 = 8^2 + (2+3)^2\nb^2 = 64 + 25\nb^2 = 89\nb = √89\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all four sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = 6 cm + 10 cm + √68 cm + √89 cm ≈ 6 + 10 + 8.25 + 9.43 ≈ 33.68 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 33.68 cm."
