    "message_1": "Let A be a set containing a total of 8 elements, and let B and C be complements of A. If B contains 3 elements, what is the total number of elements in set C?",
    "message_2": "If B and C are complements of A, that means the union of B and C contains all the elements that are not in A. Since A has 8 elements and B has 3 elements, there must be a total of 11 elements in the universal set (A, B, and C combined). Therefore, set C must contain the remaining elements, which is 11 - 8 = 3 elements. So, the total number of elements in set C is 3."
