    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function, we first need to express the function in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\ncos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2\n\nSo, f(t) = 20cos(πt/3) = 10(e^(iπt/3) + e^(-iπt/3))\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nSince f(t) is a periodic function, we can use the Fourier series representation instead of the Fourier transform. The Fourier series representation of f(t) is given by:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nω_0t) + b_n * sin(nω_0t)]\n\nwhere ω_0 is the fundamental frequency, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is over all integer values of n.\n\nIn our case, the fundamental frequency ω_0 = 2π / T, where T is the period of the function. Since the frequency of the function is 6 months, the period T = 6 months. Therefore, ω_0 = 2π / 6 = π / 3.\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n:\n\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * cos(nω_0t)] dt (from 0 to T)\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nω_0t)] dt (from 0 to T)\n\nFor n = 0, a_0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(t)] dt (from 0 to T)\n\nSince f(t) = 10(e^(iπt/3) + e^(-iπt/3)), we can see that the function has only cosine terms and no sine terms. Therefore, all b_n coefficients will be 0.\n\nFor n = 1, we have:\n\na_1 = (2/6) * ∫[20cos(πt/3) * cos(πt/3)] dt (from 0 to 6)\na_1 = (1/3) * ∫[20cos^2(πt/3)] dt (from 0 to 6)\n\nUsing the identity cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2, we get:\n\na_1 = (1/3) * ∫[10 + 10cos(2πt/3)] dt (from 0 to 6)\na_1 = (1/3) * [10t + 5sin(2πt/3) / (π/3)] (from 0 to 6)\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\na_1 = (1/3) * [10(6) + 5sin(4π) / (π/3) - 10(0) - 5sin(0) / (π/3)]\na_1 = 20\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(t) is:\n\nf(t) = 20cos(πt/3)\n\nThis is the same as the original function, which means that the first harmonic is the only harmonic present in the function. The amplitude of the first harmonic is 20, and the phase is 0 (since there is no phase shift in the cosine function)."
