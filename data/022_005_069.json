    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Residue calculus, we first need to find the poles of the given function and then compute the residues at those poles. Finally, we will use the Residue theorem to find the value of the integral.\n\nThe given function is:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 2z + 3)/(z^3 + 3z^2 + 2z)\n\nWe can factor the denominator:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 2z + 3)/(z(z + 1)(z + 2))\n\nNow, we can see that the function has poles at z = 0, z = -1, and z = -2.\n\nThe contour is the circle |z + 1| = 2, which is centered at -1 and has a radius of 2. This contour encloses the poles z = 0 and z = -1, but not z = -2. So, we only need to consider the residues at z = 0 and z = -1.\n\nResidue at z = 0:\n\nTo find the residue at z = 0, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = lim (z -> 0) [(z^2 + 2z + 3)(z + 1)(z + 2)]\n\n= lim (z -> 0) [(z^2 + 2z + 3)(z^2 + 3z + 2)]\n\n= (0^2 + 2*0 + 3)(0^2 + 3*0 + 2) = 3 * 2 = 6\n\nResidue at z = -1:\n\nTo find the residue at z = -1, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z^2 + 2z + 3)(z(z + 2))]\n\n= lim (z -> -1) [(z^2 + 2z + 3)(z^2 + z)]\n\n= ((-1)^2 + 2*(-1) + 3)((-1)^2 + (-1)) = (2)(0) = 0\n\nNow, we can use the Residue theorem to find the value of the integral. Since the contour is traversed in the clockwise direction, we need to multiply the sum of the residues by -2πi:\n\n∫(z^2 + 2z + 3)/(z^3 + 3z^2 + 2z) dz = -2πi * (6 + 0) = -12πi\n\nSo, the value of the integral along the closed contour is -12πi."
