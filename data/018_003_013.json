    "message_2": "To find the union of sets A and B, we combine all the elements from both sets without repeating any elements. So, the union of sets A and B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to show that set A is a subset of the union of sets A and B. A set A is a subset of another set B (denoted as A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also an element of B. In this case, we have:\n\nA = {1, 3, 5}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSince every element of set A (1, 3, and 5) is also an element of the union A ∪ B, we can say that A ⊆ (A ∪ B).\n\nNext, we need to show that set B is a subset of the union of sets A and B. Similarly, we have:\n\nB = {2, 4, 6}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSince every element of set B (2, 4, and 6) is also an element of the union A ∪ B, we can say that B ⊆ (A ∪ B).\n\nIn conclusion, we have found the union of sets A and B, and we have shown that both set A and set B are subsets of the union of sets A and B."
