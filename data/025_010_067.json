    "message_1": "Consider a curve C in the complex projective plane P² defined by the equation y²z = x³ + axz² + bz³, where a and b are constants. Let D be a divisor on C consisting of the intersection of C with a line L in P² that passes through three distinct points on C. If the degree of D is 3, prove that there is a unique linear equivalence class of divisors of the form D + (p), where p is a point on C.",
    "message_2": "Let the three distinct points on C that L passes through be P1, P2, and P3. Then, the divisor D can be written as D = (P1) + (P2) + (P3). Since the degree of D is 3, we have deg(D) = deg(P1) + deg(P2) + deg(P3) = 3.\n\nNow, consider a divisor of the form D + (p), where p is a point on C. We want to show that there is a unique linear equivalence class of such divisors. To do this, we will show that any two divisors of this form are linearly equivalent.\n\nLet E = D + (p) and F = D + (q) be two divisors of the form D + (p), where p and q are points on C. We want to show that E ~ F, i.e., there exists a rational function f on C such that div(f) = E - F.\n\nNote that E - F = ((P1) + (P2) + (P3) + (p)) - ((P1) + (P2) + (P3) + (q)) = (p) - (q). So, we need to find a rational function f on C with divisor (p) - (q).\n\nConsider the function f(z) = (z - p)/(z - q) on C. This function has a simple pole at q and a simple zero at p, so its divisor is (p) - (q). Therefore, div(f) = E - F, and E ~ F.\n\nSince any two divisors of the form D + (p) are linearly equivalent, there is a unique linear equivalence class of such divisors."
