    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^3 + 2z^2 + 3 = 0$\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it may not be easy to find the zeros directly. However, we can try to find at least one zero using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the divisors of 3, which are ±1 and ±3. Testing these values, we find that:\n\n$f(-1) = (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3 = -1 + 2 + 3 = 4 \\neq 0$\n$f(1) = (1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\neq 0$\n$f(-3) = (-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3 = -27 + 18 + 3 = -6 \\neq 0$\n$f(3) = (3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3 = 27 + 18 + 3 = 48 \\neq 0$\n\nNone of these values are zeros of the function. Therefore, the zeros of the function are not rational numbers, and we cannot find them easily. However, we know that there are 3 zeros (counting multiplicities) since it is a cubic polynomial.\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function. The poles are the values of $z$ for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^2 - 4 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can factor it as:\n\n$(z - 2)(z + 2) = 0$\n\nSo, the poles are located at $z = 2$ and $z = -2$. Since these are simple factors, the order of each pole is 1.\n\nIn summary, $f(z)$ has 3 zeros (counting multiplicities) that are not rational numbers, and 2 poles of order 1 located at $z = 2$ and $z = -2$."
