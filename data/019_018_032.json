    "message_2": "Let's consider two distinct irrational numbers a and b, where a < b. Our goal is to prove that there exists a rational number r between a and b.\n\nSince a and b are distinct, their difference (b - a) is positive. We can find a positive integer n such that:\n\nn(b - a) > 1\n\nThis inequality is true because the set of positive integers is unbounded, so we can always find an integer large enough to satisfy the inequality.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of numbers:\n\n{na, (n+1)a, (n+2)a, ...}\n\nSince a is irrational, all of these numbers are also irrational. However, since the difference between consecutive numbers in this set is a, there must be at least one number in this set between na and (n+1)a that is an integer. Let's call this integer m.\n\nNow, let's consider the number:\n\nr = m/n\n\nSince m and n are integers, r is a rational number. We will now show that r is between a and b.\n\nFirst, we know that:\n\nna < m < (n+1)a\n\nDividing each part of the inequality by n, we get:\n\na < r < a + a/n\n\nSince n(b - a) > 1, we can rearrange the inequality to get:\n\na/n < b - a\n\nAdding a to each part of the inequality, we get:\n\na + a/n < b\n\nCombining the inequalities, we have:\n\na < r < a + a/n < b\n\nThis shows that there exists a rational number r between the distinct irrational numbers a and b."
