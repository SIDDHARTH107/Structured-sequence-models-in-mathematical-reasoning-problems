    "message_2": "To solve the equation |4x + 7| = 23, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 4x + 7 is positive or zero\n4x + 7 = 23\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n4x = 16\nDivide by 4:\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 4x + 7 is negative\n-(4x + 7) = 23\nDistribute the negative sign:\n-4x - 7 = 23\nAdd 7 to both sides:\n-4x = 30\nDivide by -4:\nx = -7.5\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 4 and -7.5."
