    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation with the given initial condition, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n$iX(x)\\frac{dT}{dt} + X''(x)T(t) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{i}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} + \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = 0$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $t$ only and the right-hand side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{i}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k^2$\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = k^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1) $i\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k^2T(t)$\n\n2) $X''(x) = k^2X(x)$\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\n$T(t) = e^{-ik^2t}$\n\nSolving the second ODE, we get:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\n$u(x, t) = X(x)T(t) = (A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx))e^{-ik^2t}$\n\nApplying the initial condition $u(x, 0) = \\cos(x)$, we get:\n\n$\\cos(x) = A\\cos(kx)$\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we have $A = 1$ and $k = 1$. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$u(x, t) = \\cos(x)e^{-it}$\n\nNow, we can find the solution at $t = \\pi/4$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq \\pi$:\n\n$u(x, \\pi/4) = \\cos(x)e^{-i\\pi/4}$"
