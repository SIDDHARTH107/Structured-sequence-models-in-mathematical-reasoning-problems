    "message_1": "A telecommunications company has 7 available transmission towers for their network. The company wants to choose a specific set of 3 towers to cover an area in a city. Each tower has a different transmission range and the towers overlap slightly, meaning that each of the 3 chosen towers can cover different amounts of area. The coverage area for each tower is as follows:\n\n- Tower 1: 10 square miles\n- Tower 2: 8 square miles\n- Tower 3: 12 square miles\n- Tower 4: 7 square miles\n- Tower 5: 6 square miles\n- Tower 6: 9 square miles\n- Tower 7: 11 square miles\n\nWhat is the maximum total coverage area the company can achieve by selecting a set of 3 towers?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum total coverage area, we need to select the 3 towers with the highest coverage areas. These are:\n\n- Tower 3: 12 square miles\n- Tower 7: 11 square miles\n- Tower 1: 10 square miles\n\nThe maximum total coverage area is the sum of these three towers' coverage areas:\n\n12 + 11 + 10 = 33 square miles\n\nSo, the maximum total coverage area the company can achieve by selecting a set of 3 towers is 33 square miles."
