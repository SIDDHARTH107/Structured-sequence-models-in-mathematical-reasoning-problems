    "message_2": "To choose 3 items from a set of 7 distinct items, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (7 in this case) and k is the number of items to choose (3 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\n\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 ways to choose 3 items from a set of 7 distinct items."
