    "message_1": "Consider a European call option with a strike price of $100$, a time to maturity of $1$ year, and the underlying asset following a Geometric Brownian Motion with a current price of $S_0 = $ $110$, risk-free interest rate of $5\\%$, and a constant volatility of $0.2$. Use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to calculate the price of the option.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the price of the European call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we first need to compute the values of d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S0 / K) + (r + (σ^2) / 2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nS0 = current price of the underlying asset = $110\nK = strike price = $100\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.05\nσ = constant volatility = 0.2\nT = time to maturity = 1 year\n\nLet's compute d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(110 / 100) + (0.05 + (0.2^2) / 2) * 1) / (0.2 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = (0.0953 + (0.05 + 0.02) * 1) / 0.2\nd1 = (0.0953 + 0.07) / 0.2\nd1 = 0.825\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = 0.825 - 0.2 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = 0.625\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to calculate the price of the European call option:\n\nC = S0 * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = price of the call option\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nN(d1) = N(0.825) ≈ 0.795\nN(d2) = N(0.625) ≈ 0.734\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nC = 110 * 0.795 - 100 * e^(-0.05 * 1) * 0.734\nC = 87.45 - 100 * 0.9512 * 0.734\nC = 87.45 - 69.74\nC = 17.71\n\nTherefore, the price of the European call option is approximately $17.71."
