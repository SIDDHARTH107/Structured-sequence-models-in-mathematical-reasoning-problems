    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products A and B. The production of each product requires two types of machines, X and Y. The company has 10 machines of X type and 12 machines of Y type. The profit margins on each unit of product A and B are $20 and $15 respectively. Due to the limited availability of machines X and Y, the production of product A requires 2 machines of X and 2 machines of Y, while the production of product B requires 3 machines of X and 1 machine of Y. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of products A and B should it produce, respectively, using tabu search optimization algorithm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the tabu search optimization algorithm, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and the neighborhood search strategy.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 20A + 15B\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2A + 3B <= 10 (X machines constraint)\n2. 2A + B <= 12 (Y machines constraint)\n3. A >= 0, B >= 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nNeighborhood search strategy: We will consider swapping one unit of product A with one unit of product B or vice versa as a move in the search space.\n\nNow, let's perform the tabu search optimization algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the solution: Start with A = 0, B = 0 (no products produced)\n2. Calculate the initial profit: P = 20(0) + 15(0) = 0\n3. Perform neighborhood search: \n   - Swap one unit of A with one unit of B: A = 1, B = 1 (P = 20(1) + 15(1) = 35)\n   - Swap one unit of B with one unit of A: A = 0, B = 0 (P = 0)\n4. Update the tabu list and select the best non-tabu move: A = 1, B = 1 (P = 35)\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or no improvement in the best solution for a certain number of iterations).\n\nAfter performing the tabu search optimization algorithm, we find that the optimal solution is to produce 3 units of product A and 2 units of product B, which yields a maximum profit of P = 20(3) + 15(2) = 60 + 30 = $90."
