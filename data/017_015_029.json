    "message_2": "The five non-abelian groups of order 24 are:\n\n1. The symmetric group S4\n2. The dihedral group D12\n3. The dicyclic group Q24\n4. The semidirect product of Z4 and Z6, denoted as Z4 ⋊ Z6\n5. The semidirect product of Z2 and Z12, denoted as Z2 ⋊ Z12\n\nWe will now prove that these groups are non-isomorphic to the cyclic group C24 and the alternating group A5.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C24. A cyclic group of order 24 has a single generator, and all its elements can be expressed as powers of this generator. Cyclic groups are abelian, meaning that the group operation is commutative. However, all five non-abelian groups listed above are non-commutative, which means they cannot be isomorphic to C24.\n\nNow let's consider the alternating group A5. A5 is a simple group, meaning it has no nontrivial normal subgroups. We will show that each of the five non-abelian groups of order 24 has a nontrivial normal subgroup, which implies they cannot be isomorphic to A5.\n\n1. S4: The subgroup A4, consisting of all even permutations, is a normal subgroup of S4.\n2. D12: The subgroup of rotations is a normal subgroup of D12.\n3. Q24: The subgroup generated by the central element of order 2 is a normal subgroup of Q24.\n4. Z4 ⋊ Z6: The subgroup Z4 is a normal subgroup of Z4 ⋊ Z6.\n5. Z2 ⋊ Z12: The subgroup Z12 is a normal subgroup of Z2 ⋊ Z12.\n\nSince all five non-abelian groups of order 24 have nontrivial normal subgroups, they cannot be isomorphic to the simple group A5. Therefore, we have shown that these five non-abelian groups are not isomorphic to either C24 or A5."
