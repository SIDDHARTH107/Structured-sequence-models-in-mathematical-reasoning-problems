    "message_1": "Let P and Q be two propositions such that P ∨ Q is true. If P is true, what can we say about Q? Is there any other conclusion we can draw about Q if we know that the logical system being used is intuitionistic logic?",
    "message_2": "If P is true and P ∨ Q is true, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the truth value of Q in classical or intuitionistic logic. Q could be true or false, but since P is true, the disjunction P ∨ Q still holds true.\n\nIn intuitionistic logic, the same conclusion applies. Intuitionistic logic is a constructive logic, which means that to prove a statement, we must provide a construction or a witness for it. However, knowing that P is true and P ∨ Q is true does not provide any additional information about Q. Therefore, we cannot draw any further conclusions about Q in intuitionistic logic."
