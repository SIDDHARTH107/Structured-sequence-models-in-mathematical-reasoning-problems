    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we first find the prime factorization of 18, which is 2 × 3^2. Now, we will use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^a × q^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are their respective powers.\n\nThe formula is (a + 1)(b + 1) if p and q are coprime, and gcd(p^a - 1, q^b - 1) if p and q are not coprime. In our case, p = 2, q = 3, a = 1, and b = 2.\n\nSince 2 and 3 are coprime, we can use the first formula:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = (a + 1)(b + 1) = (1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 × 3 = 6.\n\nHowever, this formula overcounts the number of non-isomorphic groups. We need to subtract the overcounted groups, which are the groups that are isomorphic to a direct product of two smaller groups.\n\nThere are two such groups: Z_6 (cyclic group of order 6) and Z_3 × Z_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). So, we need to subtract 2 from the result:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = 6 - 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 18."
