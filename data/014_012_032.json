    "message_2": "To encrypt a message using the Vigenere cipher, we need to use a tabula recta (a table of alphabets) and follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the plaintext and key in rows, repeating the key as many times as needed to cover the entire plaintext.\n2. For each letter in the plaintext, find the corresponding letter in the key.\n3. Use the tabula recta to find the intersection of the row of the plaintext letter and the column of the key letter. This will give you the ciphertext letter.\n\nHere's the process for the given plaintext \"ATTACK\" and key \"MATH\":\n\nPlaintext: ATTACK\nKey:      MATHMA\n\nNow, let's find the ciphertext using the tabula recta:\n\nA (plaintext) + M (key) = M (ciphertext)\nT (plaintext) + A (key) = T (ciphertext)\nT (plaintext) + T (key) = X (ciphertext)\nA (plaintext) + H (key) = H (ciphertext)\nC (plaintext) + M (key) = O (ciphertext)\nK (plaintext) + A (key) = K (ciphertext)\n\nSo, the ciphertext is \"MTXHOK\"."
