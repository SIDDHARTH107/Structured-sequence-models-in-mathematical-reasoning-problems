    "message_1": "A side of an equilateral triangle measures 7 centimeters. What is the perimeter of the triangle in centimeters?",
    "message_2": "An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length. Since one side measures 7 centimeters, the other two sides also measure 7 centimeters each. To find the perimeter, add the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = 7 cm + 7 cm + 7 cm = 21 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 21 centimeters."
