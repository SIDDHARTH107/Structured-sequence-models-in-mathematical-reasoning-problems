    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem using Fourier series to solve a partial differential equation:\n\nConsider the following partial differential equation with periodic boundary conditions on the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$:\n\n$$u_t = 2u_{xx} + 2\\sin(x)$$\n\nwhere $u(x, t)$ is a function of two variables $x$ and $t$. Find the solution to this equation using Fourier series with the initial condition $u(x, 0) = \\cos(x)$.\n\nHint: Use separation of variables to obtain the general solution in terms of Fourier series, and then use the initial condition to determine the Fourier coefficients.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first use separation of variables. Let $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = 2X''(x)T(t) + 2\\sin(x)$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $2XT$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{2T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{\\sin(x)}{X(x)T(t)}$$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{2T(t)} = -k^2$$\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{\\sin(x)}{X(x)T(t)} = -k^2$$\n\nNow, we solve the two ordinary differential equations separately:\n\n1. For $T(t)$: \n\n$$T'(t) = -2k^2T(t)$$\n\nThe general solution for this ODE is:\n\n$$T(t) = A\\exp(-2k^2t)$$\n\n2. For $X(x)$:\n\n$$X''(x) + (k^2X(x) - \\frac{\\sin(x)}{T(t)}) = 0$$\n\nSince the forcing term $\\sin(x)$ is periodic, we can use Fourier series to represent the solution $X(x)$:\n\n$$X(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{inx}$$\n\nSubstitute this into the ODE for $X(x)$:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} -n^2c_n e^{inx} + k^2\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{inx} = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{T(t)}$$\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier coefficients $c_n$ by using the orthogonality property of complex exponentials:\n\n$$c_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{T(t)} + n^2e^{inx} - k^2e^{inx}\\right)e^{-inx} dx$$\n\nSince the initial condition is $u(x, 0) = \\cos(x)$, we have:\n\n$$X(x)T(0) = \\cos(x)$$\n\nSubstitute the general solution for $T(t)$:\n\n$$X(x)A = \\cos(x)$$\n\nThus, the solution to the PDE is:\n\n$$u(x, t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{inx} A\\exp(-2k^2t)$$\n\nUsing the initial condition, we can find the Fourier coefficients $c_n$ and the constant $A$, and then obtain the solution to the given PDE."
