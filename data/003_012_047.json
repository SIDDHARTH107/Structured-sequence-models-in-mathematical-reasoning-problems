    "message_1": "A building is 30 meters tall. An observer stands 50 meters away from the building. What is the angle of elevation from the observer's eye to the top of the building? Round your answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is the angle we want to find, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (30 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the observer to the building (50 meters).\n\nLet θ be the angle of elevation. Then,\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = 30 / 50\ntan(θ) = 0.6\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose tangent is 0.6. We can use the arctangent (inverse tangent) function for this:\n\nθ = arctan(0.6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 30.96 degrees\n\nRounding to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation is approximately 31 degrees."
