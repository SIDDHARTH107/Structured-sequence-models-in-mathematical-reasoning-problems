    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve construction is a fractal pattern that starts with a single filled triangle (iteration 1) and then, in each subsequent iteration, the filled triangles are replaced by smaller triangles with a hole in the center.\n\nThe number of filled triangles in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of filled triangles = (3^(iteration - 1))\n\nSo, for the 8th iteration:\n\nNumber of filled triangles = (3^(8 - 1)) = 3^7 = 2187\n\nThere are 2187 filled triangles in the 8th iteration of the Sierpinski sieve construction."
