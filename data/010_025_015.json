    "message_1": "Suppose we have a topological quantum field theory that assigns a complex number to a closed, oriented 3-manifold. Let Z(M) denote the value assigned by the theory to the manifold M. Suppose that we know Z(S^1 x S^2) = 5 and Z(RP^3) = -1. Compute Z(T^3), the value assigned by the theory to the 3-torus T^3.",
    "message_2": "To compute Z(T^3), we can use the property of topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that they are invariant under cutting and gluing of manifolds along their boundaries. We can express the 3-torus T^3 as a combination of the given manifolds S^1 x S^2 and RP^3.\n\nFirst, note that T^3 can be obtained by gluing two copies of S^1 x D^2 along their boundary, which is S^1 x S^1. Here, D^2 is a 2-dimensional disk. Similarly, RP^3 can be obtained by gluing two copies of D^3 along their boundary, which is RP^2. Here, D^3 is a 3-dimensional disk.\n\nNow, consider the following process:\n\n1. Take two copies of S^1 x S^2 and remove a small open 3-ball from each. This results in two copies of S^1 x D^2.\n\n2. Glue these two copies of S^1 x D^2 along their boundary, which is S^1 x S^1, to obtain T^3.\n\n3. Take two copies of RP^3 and remove a small open 3-ball from each. This results in two copies of D^3.\n\n4. Glue these two copies of D^3 along their boundary, which is RP^2, to obtain S^3.\n\nUsing the properties of TQFTs, we can write the following equation:\n\nZ(T^3) * Z(S^3) = Z(S^1 x S^2)^2 * Z(RP^3)^2\n\nWe know that Z(S^3) = 1, as TQFTs assign the value 1 to the 3-sphere. We are also given that Z(S^1 x S^2) = 5 and Z(RP^3) = -1. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nZ(T^3) * 1 = 5^2 * (-1)^2\nZ(T^3) = 25\n\nTherefore, the value assigned by the theory to the 3-torus T^3 is Z(T^3) = 25."
