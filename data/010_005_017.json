    "message_1": "Suppose X is a connected topological space with exactly 4 path components. What is the minimum number of open sets required in a topology on X?",
    "message_2": "A connected topological space is a space that cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open sets. Since X is given to be connected, it cannot have more than one path component. However, the problem states that X has exactly 4 path components, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem statement is incorrect, and there is no solution for the given conditions."
