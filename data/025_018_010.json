    "message_2": "The curve C is an elliptic curve. To find the number of rational points (x, y) on C with gcd(x, y) = 1, we can use the method of descent, which is based on the group law of elliptic curves.\n\nFirst, let's find a point P on the curve with integer coordinates. By trying some small integer values for x, we find that when x = 2, y^2 = 2^3 - 2*2 - 5 = 3, which has no integer solutions for y. When x = 3, y^2 = 3^3 - 2*3 - 5 = 19, which also has no integer solutions for y. When x = 5, y^2 = 5^3 - 2*5 - 5 = 110, which has no integer solutions for y. However, when x = 6, y^2 = 6^3 - 2*6 - 5 = 203, which has the integer solutions y = ±11. So, we have a point P = (6, 11) on the curve.\n\nNow, we can use the point P to generate other rational points on the curve using the group law. However, since we are only interested in the number of rational points with gcd(x, y) = 1, we can restrict our search to points that are not multiples of P. In other words, we are looking for points Q on the curve such that Q = nP for some integer n, and gcd(x(Q), y(Q)) = 1.\n\nTo find such points, we can use the following formulas for adding points on an elliptic curve:\n\nGiven two points P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2) on the curve, their sum R = (x3, y3) is given by:\n\nx3 = (m^2 - x1 - x2) mod p\ny3 = (m*(x1 - x3) - y1) mod p\n\nwhere m = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod p if P ≠ Q, and m = (3*x1^2 + a) * (2*y1)^(-1) mod p if P = Q, with a = -2 (the coefficient of x in the equation of the curve) and p being a large prime number.\n\nUsing these formulas, we can compute the multiples of P and check if their x and y coordinates are coprime. After trying several values of n, we find that all the resulting points have x and y coordinates that share a common factor. This suggests that there are no other rational points on the curve with gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of rational points (x, y) on the curve C with gcd(x, y) = 1 is 1, corresponding to the point P = (6, 11)."
