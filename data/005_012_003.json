    "message_2": "To construct a 95% confidence interval for the true average weight of the box of cereal, we will use the following formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (average weight of the sample)\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96)\nσ = standard deviation of the sample\nn = sample size\n\nGiven the information provided:\nx̄ = 400 grams\nσ = 20 grams\nn = 50\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 400 ± (1.96 * (20 / √50))\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard error = 20 / √50 ≈ 2.83\n\nNow, multiply the Z-score by the standard error:\n\nMargin of error = 1.96 * 2.83 ≈ 5.54\n\nFinally, add and subtract the margin of error from the sample mean:\n\nLower limit = 400 - 5.54 ≈ 394.46 grams\nUpper limit = 400 + 5.54 ≈ 405.54 grams\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average weight of the box of cereal is approximately (394.46 grams, 405.54 grams)."
