    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we'll write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n```\n[ 2  1 -1 |  4 ]\n[ 4 -3  5 | -5 ]\n[ 1  7 -2 |  7 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 3 to get a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n```\n[ 1  7 -2 |  7 ]\n[ 4 -3  5 | -5 ]\n[ 2  1 -1 |  4 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with (-4 * Row 1) + Row 2, and Row 3 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1  7 -2 |  7 ]\n[ 0 -31 13 | -33 ]\n[ 0 -13  3 | -10 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Multiply Row 2 by -1/31 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n```\n[  1   7  -2 |   7 ]\n[  0   1 -13/31 | 33/31 ]\n[  0 -13   3 | -10 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 1 with (-7 * Row 2) + Row 1, and Row 3 with (13 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  1   0  89/31 | -154/31 ]\n[  0   1 -13/31 |  33/31 ]\n[  0   0 -10/31 |   9/31 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Multiply Row 3 by -31/10 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n```\n[  1   0  89/31 | -154/31 ]\n[  0   1 -13/31 |  33/31 ]\n[  0   0   1    |  -9/10 ]\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = -9/10.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - (13/31)(-9/10) = 33/31, which gives y = 2.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + (89/31)(-9/10) = -154/31, which gives x = 1.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = -9/10."
