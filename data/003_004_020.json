    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation cos(x) = 0.5, we need to find the angles x in the interval [0, 2π] for which the cosine function has a value of 0.5.\n\nThe angles x that satisfy this equation are:\n\nx = π/3 (60 degrees) and x = 5π/3 (300 degrees)\n\nThese are the two angles in the interval [0, 2π] for which cos(x) = 0.5."
