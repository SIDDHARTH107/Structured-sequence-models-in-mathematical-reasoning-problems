Instead of collecting data from all the employees, they want to use a simple random sampling method to select a sample of 50 employees. What is the probability that one particular employee is selected in the sample?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that one particular employee is selected in the sample, we can use the formula for the probability of simple random sampling:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways the employee can be selected) / (Total number of ways to select the sample)\n\nIn this case, there are 500 employees, and the company wants to select a sample of 50 employees. So, the total number of ways to select the sample is the number of combinations of choosing 50 employees from 500, which can be represented as C(500, 50).\n\nC(500, 50) = 500! / (50! * (500 - 50)!)\n\nNow, let's consider the number of ways the particular employee can be selected. Since the employee is already selected, we need to choose the remaining 49 employees from the remaining 499 employees. This can be represented as C(499, 49).\n\nC(499, 49) = 499! / (49! * (499 - 49)!)\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = C(499, 49) / C(500, 50)\n\nProbability = (499! / (49! * 450!)) / (500! / (50! * 450!))\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can cancel out the common terms:\n\nProbability = (499! * 50!) / (500! * 49!)\n\nNow, we can further simplify the expression by expanding 500!:\n\nProbability = (499! * 50!) / (500 * 499! * 49!)\n\nNow, we can cancel out 499! from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\nProbability = 50! / (500 * 49!)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = 1 / 10\n\nSo, the probability that one particular employee is selected in the sample is 1/10 or 0.1 or 10%."
