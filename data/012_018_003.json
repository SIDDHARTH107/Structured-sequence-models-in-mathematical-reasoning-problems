Identify the vertices with the minimum degree (the number of edges connected to the vertex).\n2. Check the number of edges connected to these vertices.\n3. The minimum number of edges connected to these vertices is the edge connectivity.\n\nIn the given graph, the vertices and their degrees are:\n\n1. Vertex 1: degree 2 (connected to vertices 2 and 3)\n2. Vertex 2: degree 3 (connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4)\n3. Vertex 3: degree 3 (connected to vertices 1, 2, and 4)\n4. Vertex 4: degree 3 (connected to vertices 2, 3, and 5)\n5. Vertex 5: degree 3 (connected to vertices 4, 6, and 7)\n6. Vertex 6: degree 2 (connected to vertices 5 and 7)\n7. Vertex 7: degree 2 (connected to vertices 5 and 6)\n\nVertices 1, 6, and 7 have the minimum degree of 2. Therefore, the edge connectivity of the graph is 2."
