    "message_2": "Since the function is analytic in the upper half-plane and satisfies $f(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ on the real axis, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle. The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in the upper half-plane and continuous on the real axis, then it can be analytically continued to the lower half-plane by reflecting it across the real axis.\n\nNow, let's find the value of $f(z)$ at the point $z = i$. Since $f(z) = z$ on the imaginary axis, we have:\n\n$$f(i) = i$$\n\nNow, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle to find the value of $f(z)$ at the point $z = -i$. Since $f(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ on the real axis, we have:\n\n$$f(-i) = \\overline{f(\\overline{-i})} = \\overline{f(i)} = \\overline{i} = -i$$\n\nHowever, since $f(z) = z$ on the imaginary axis, we also have:\n\n$$f(-i) = -i$$\n\nThus, the value of $f(z)$ at the point $z = i$ is:\n\n$$f(i) = i$$"
