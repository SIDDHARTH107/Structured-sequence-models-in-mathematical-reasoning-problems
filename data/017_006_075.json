    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 15. Since 15 = 3 * 5, where 3 and 5 are prime numbers, we can apply Sylow's Theorems.\n\nBy Sylow's First Theorem, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3 and a Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5 in G.\n\nBy Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 divides 5 and n_3 = 1 or 5. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 divides 3 and n_5 = 1 or 3.\n\nIf n_3 = n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup Q. Since these subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q by the Internal Direct Product Theorem, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5.\n\nIf n_3 = 1 and n_5 = 3, or n_3 = 5 and n_5 = 1, then one of the Sylow subgroups is unique and normal in G. Without loss of generality, let P be the unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, for any Sylow 5-subgroup Q, we have PQ is a subgroup of G with order 15, since the orders of P and Q are coprime and P ∩ Q = {e}. Since PQ has the same order as G, PQ = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q by the Internal Direct Product Theorem, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5.\n\nIf n_3 = 5 and n_5 = 3, then there are 5 Sylow 3-subgroups and 3 Sylow 5-subgroups. However, this case is not possible because the total number of elements in G would be greater than 15 (each Sylow 3-subgroup has 2 non-identity elements and each Sylow 5-subgroup has 4 non-identity elements, so we would have at least 2*5 + 4*3 = 22 elements, which contradicts the fact that G has 15 elements).\n\nThus, in all possible cases, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5. If G is generated by a single element, then G is cyclic. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5."
