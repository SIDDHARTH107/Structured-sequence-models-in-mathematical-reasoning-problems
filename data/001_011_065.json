    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2x-3)/(x+1) = 5/3, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n3(2x - 3) = 5(x + 1)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers on both sides of the equation:\n\n6x - 9 = 5x + 5\n\nNext, isolate the variable x by subtracting 5x from both sides:\n\n6x - 5x - 9 = 5x - 5x + 5\n\nx - 9 = 5\n\nNow, add 9 to both sides to solve for x:\n\nx - 9 + 9 = 5 + 9\n\nx = 14\n\nSo, the solution is x = 14."
