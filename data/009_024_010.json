    "message_1": "The Navier-Stokes equations model the motion of fluids such as air and water. Consider a two-dimensional flow with a velocity given by $u(x,y,t)=2x\\sqrt{y}e^{-t}$ and $v(x,y,t)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{y}e^{-t}$ in a square domain $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$. Determine the vorticity, $\\omega$, of the flow at time $t=1$.",
    "message_2": "The vorticity of a two-dimensional flow is defined as the curl of the velocity vector field, which in this case is given by the difference between the partial derivatives of the velocity components: $\\omega = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$.\n\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives of the velocity components:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{2}x(2y)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-t}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\nNow, we can find the vorticity:\n\n$\\omega = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0 - \\frac{1}{2}x(2y)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-t}$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given time $t=1$:\n\n$\\omega(x, y, 1) = -\\frac{1}{2}x(2y)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-1}$\n\nSo, the vorticity of the flow at time $t=1$ is given by $\\omega(x, y, 1) = -\\frac{1}{2}xe^{-1}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2y}}$."
