    "message_2": "To find the number of moduli for a genus 3 algebraic curve with 5 double points, we can use the Plücker formula. The Plücker formula relates the degree (d) of an algebraic curve, the genus (g) of the curve, and the number of double points (r) on the curve:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2 - r\n\nIn this case, we are given that the genus g = 3 and the number of double points r = 5. We can rearrange the Plücker formula to solve for the degree d:\n\n3 = (d-1)(d-2)/2 - 5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n6 = (d-1)(d-2) - 10\n\nAdding 10 to both sides, we have:\n\n16 = (d-1)(d-2)\n\nNow we need to find the integer values of d that satisfy this equation. We can test different values of d:\n\n- For d = 4, we have (4-1)(4-2) = 3*2 = 6, which does not satisfy the equation.\n- For d = 5, we have (5-1)(5-2) = 4*3 = 12, which does not satisfy the equation.\n- For d = 6, we have (6-1)(6-2) = 5*4 = 20, which does not satisfy the equation.\n- For d = 7, we have (7-1)(7-2) = 6*5 = 30, which does not satisfy the equation.\n\nHowever, we can notice that the left-hand side of the equation is always even, while the right-hand side is always odd. This means that there is no integer value of d that satisfies the equation, and therefore, there is no genus 3 algebraic curve with 5 double points."
