    "message_2": "There are two distinct groups of order 6: the cyclic group C6 and the dihedral group D3 (also known as D6 in some notations). We will show that any group of order 6 is isomorphic to one of these two groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 6. By the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 2. Let H be a subgroup of order 3 and K be a subgroup of order 2. Since the orders of H and K are prime, both H and K are cyclic. Thus, H is isomorphic to C3 and K is isomorphic to C2.\n\nNow, consider the element a in H and the element b in K. Since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, the order of the product ab is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b, which is 6. Therefore, G has an element of order 6. This means G is a cyclic group generated by this element, and G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nHowever, if G is not cyclic, then G must be non-abelian. In this case, we can show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3. Since G has an element of order 2 (from K) and an element of order 3 (from H), we can represent G as the set {1, a, a^2, b, ba, ba^2}, where a has order 3 and b has order 2. The group operation can be defined as follows:\n\n- a^3 = 1\n- b^2 = 1\n- ba = a^2b\n\nThis operation satisfies the group axioms, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two distinct groups of order 6, and any group of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
