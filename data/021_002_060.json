    "message_1": "A matrix A has eigenvalues -2, 3, and 5 with corresponding eigenvectors u, v, and w respectively. Find the largest eigenvalue of A using the power iteration method with the initial vector x0=[1 1 1]. Round your answer to two decimal places after five iterations.",
    "message_2": "To find the largest eigenvalue using the power iteration method, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial vector x0 (in this case, [1 1 1]).\n2. Compute the matrix-vector product Ax0.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the desired number of iterations (in this case, 5 iterations).\n5. Estimate the largest eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient.\n\nHowever, we do not have the matrix A itself, only its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Therefore, we cannot directly apply the power iteration method. Instead, we can use the information given to deduce the largest eigenvalue.\n\nSince the eigenvalues of A are -2, 3, and 5, the largest eigenvalue is 5."
