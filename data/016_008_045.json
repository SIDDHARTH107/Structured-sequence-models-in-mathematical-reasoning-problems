    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each straight line segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments, so N = 4. The scaling factor s is 3, as each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nNow we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve remains the same after any number of iterations, including 5 iterations. So, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after 5 iterations is approximately 1.2619."
