    "message_1": "A ferris wheel has a diameter of 40 meters and rotates at a speed of 5 revolutions per minute. If the height of a passenger on the wheel is given by the function h(t) = 20 sin(π/4 t) + 25 where t is the time in minutes since the passenger got on the wheel, what is the average height of the passenger during one complete revolution?",
    "message_2": "To find the average height of the passenger during one complete revolution, we need to integrate the height function h(t) over one revolution and then divide by the time period of one revolution.\n\nFirst, let's find the time period of one revolution. Since the Ferris wheel rotates at a speed of 5 revolutions per minute, the time period of one revolution is:\n\nT = 1 / 5 minutes = 1/5 * 60 seconds = 12 seconds\n\nNow, we need to convert the height function h(t) from minutes to seconds. Let s be the time in seconds, then t = s / 60. Substituting this into the height function, we get:\n\nh(s) = 20 sin(π/4 * (s/60)) + 25\nh(s) = 20 sin(πs/240) + 25\n\nNow, we'll integrate h(s) over one revolution (from 0 to 12 seconds) and divide by the time period (12 seconds) to find the average height:\n\naverage height = (1/12) * ∫[0, 12] (20 sin(πs/240) + 25) ds\n\nTo solve this integral, we'll integrate the two terms separately:\n\n∫(20 sin(πs/240)) ds = (-240/π) * cos(πs/240) + C1\n∫(25) ds = 25s + C2\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integrals over the interval [0, 12]:\n\n((-240/π) * cos(π(12)/240) - (-240/π) * cos(π(0)/240)) + (25(12) - 25(0))\n\n= (-240/π) * (cos(π/20) - cos(0)) + 300\n\nNow, we'll divide by the time period (12 seconds) to find the average height:\n\naverage height = (1/12) * (-240/π) * (cos(π/20) - cos(0)) + 25\n\naverage height ≈ 25 - (20/π) * (cos(π/20) - 1)\n\nThe average height of the passenger during one complete revolution is approximately 25 - (20/π) * (cos(π/20) - 1) meters."
