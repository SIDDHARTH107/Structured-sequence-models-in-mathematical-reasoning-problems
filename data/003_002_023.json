    "message_2": "In a right-angled triangle, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for each angle can be calculated using the lengths of the sides. Let's denote the sides as follows:\n\n- Opposite side to angle A: a\n- Opposite side to angle B: b\n- Hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle): c\n\nNow, let's calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for angle A (30 degrees) and angle B (60 degrees).\n\nFor angle A (30 degrees):\n1. Sine (sin A) = opposite side / hypotenuse = a / c\n2. Cosine (cos A) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = b / c\n3. Tangent (tan A) = opposite side / adjacent side = a / b\n\nFor angle B (60 degrees):\n1. Sine (sin B) = opposite side / hypotenuse = b / c\n2. Cosine (cos B) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = a / c\n3. Tangent (tan B) = opposite side / adjacent side = b / a\n\nNow, let's find the values of these ratios using the given angles:\n\nFor angle A (30 degrees):\n1. sin(30) = 1/2\n2. cos(30) = √3/2\n3. tan(30) = 1/√3 = √3/3\n\nFor angle B (60 degrees):\n1. sin(60) = √3/2\n2. cos(60) = 1/2\n3. tan(60) = √3\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for angle A (30 degrees) are 1/2, √3/2, and √3/3, respectively. The sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for angle B (60 degrees) are √3/2, 1/2, and √3, respectively."
