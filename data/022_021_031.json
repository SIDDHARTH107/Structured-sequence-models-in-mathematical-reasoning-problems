    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of f(t), we need to perform a partial fraction decomposition on F(s) and then find the inverse Laplace transform of each term.\n\nF(s) = (4s^2 - 7s + 2)/(s^3 + 2s^2 + s)\n\nLet's perform the partial fraction decomposition:\n\nF(s) = A/s + B/(s + 1) + C/(s + 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by the common denominator (s * (s + 1) * (s + 2)):\n\n4s^2 - 7s + 2 = A(s + 1)(s + 2) + B(s)(s + 2) + C(s)(s + 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of A, B, and C. We can do this by solving the following system of equations:\n\n1. For s = 0: 2 = 2A => A = 1\n2. For s = -1: -1 = -B => B = 1\n3. For s = -2: 6 = 2C => C = 3\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\nF(s) = 1/s + 1/(s + 1) + 3/(s + 2)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\n1. L^(-1){1/s} = 1 * e^(0*t) = 1\n2. L^(-1){1/(s + 1)} = e^(-1*t)\n3. L^(-1){3/(s + 2)} = 3 * e^(-2*t)\n\nFinally, we can combine these terms to find the inverse Laplace transform of f(t):\n\nf(t) = 1 + e^(-t) + 3e^(-2*t)"
