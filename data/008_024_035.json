    "message_2": "To find the value of k for which the system has multiple solutions, we need to find the value of k that makes the system dependent. We can do this by using the Gaussian elimination method to find the row echelon form of the augmented matrix.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  5 |\n| 2  1  5 | 10 |\n| 3  4  k | 17 |\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate the 2 in the second row, first column. To do this, we'll subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  5 |\n| 0 -3 11 |  0 |\n| 3  4  k | 17 |\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 3 in the third row, first column. To do this, we'll subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  5 |\n| 0 -3 11 |  0 |\n| 0 -2  k+9 |  2 |\n\nNow, we'll eliminate the -2 in the third row, second column. To do this, we'll add 2/3 times the second row to the third row:\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  5 |\n| 0 -3 11 |  0 |\n| 0  0  k+9 - 22/3 |  2 |\n\nFor the system to have multiple solutions, the last row should be 0 = 0. So, we need to find the value of k that makes the third row all zeros:\n\nk + 9 - 22/3 = 0\n\nMultiplying by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n3(k + 9) - 22 = 0\n3k + 27 - 22 = 0\n3k + 5 = 0\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\n3k = -5\nk = -5/3\n\nSo, the value of k for which the system has multiple solutions is k = -5/3."
