    "message_2": "To find the integer solutions of the Diophantine equation $3x + 5y = 17$, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients of x and y, which are 3 and 5. The GCD(3, 5) is 1.\n2. Since the GCD(3, 5) divides 17, there are integer solutions to the equation.\n3. Find a particular solution. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which states that there exist integers u and v such that 3u + 5v = 1. Multiplying both sides by 17, we get 3(17u) + 5(17v) = 17, so x = 17u and y = 17v is a particular solution.\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that u = 2 and v = -1, so a particular solution is x = 17(2) = 34 and y = 17(-1) = -17.\n\n4. Find the general solution. The general solution of the Diophantine equation is given by x = x0 + (5t) and y = y0 - (3t), where x0 and y0 are the particular solutions found in step 3, and t is an integer.\n\nSo, the general solution is x = 34 + (5t) and y = -17 - (3t).\n\nNow, we can find the integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for t:\n\n- If t = 0, x = 34 and y = -17.\n- If t = 1, x = 34 + 5 = 39 and y = -17 - 3 = -20.\n- If t = -1, x = 34 - 5 = 29 and y = -17 + 3 = -14.\n\nThere are no other integer solutions, as increasing or decreasing t further will result in either x or y being non-integer values. Therefore, the integer solutions of the equation $3x + 5y = 17$ are (34, -17), (39, -20), and (29, -14)."
