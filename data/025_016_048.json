    "message_2": "(a) To show that the map is birational, we need to show that it is a rational map and that it has a rational inverse. The map φ: X → P^1 given by φ(x, y) = [x:y] is clearly a rational map, as it is defined by the rational functions x and y. Now, we need to find a rational inverse for this map.\n\nLet [u:v] ∈ P^1 be a point in the image of φ. Then there exists a point (x, y) ∈ X such that φ(x, y) = [u:v]. This means that x = uλ and y = vλ for some λ ≠ 0. Substituting these expressions into the equation of the curve X, we get (vλ)^2 = (uλ)^3 + (uλ). Dividing by λ^2, we have v^2 = u^3λ^2 + uλ. Thus, λ = v^2/(u^3 + u). Therefore, the inverse map ψ: P^1 → X is given by ψ(u, v) = (u, v(v^2/(u^3 + u))). This map is rational, so φ is birational onto its image.\n\n(b) To determine the image of the map φ, we need to find all points [u:v] ∈ P^1 such that there exists a point (x, y) ∈ X with φ(x, y) = [u:v]. As we have seen in part (a), this is equivalent to finding all points (u, v) ∈ P^1 such that v^2 = u^3λ^2 + uλ for some λ ≠ 0. This equation can be rewritten as v^2 = u(u^2λ + λ). Since u ≠ 0, we can divide by u to get v^2/u = u^2λ + λ. Thus, the image of φ consists of all points [u:v] ∈ P^1 such that v^2/u = u^2λ + λ for some λ ≠ 0.\n\nThe inverse map ψ: P^1 → X is given by ψ(u, v) = (u, v(v^2/(u^3 + u))). To find an equation for this map, we need to eliminate λ from the equation v^2/u = u^2λ + λ. Multiplying both sides by u, we get v^2 = u^3λ + uλ. Thus, λ = v^2/(u^3 + u), and the inverse map is given by ψ(u, v) = (u, v(v^2/(u^3 + u))).\n\n(c) To show that the function field of X is generated by the function x/[y], we need to show that any rational function on X can be written as a rational function in x/[y]. Let f(x, y) be a rational function on X. Since X is a curve, f(x, y) can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in x and y, say f(x, y) = p(x, y)/q(x, y). Since f(x, y) is a rational function on X, it must satisfy the equation of X, i.e., y^2 = x^3 + x. We can substitute this equation into the polynomials p(x, y) and q(x, y) to eliminate y and obtain polynomials p'(x) and q'(x) in x alone. Then f(x, y) = p'(x)/q'(x), and we can write f(x, y) as a rational function in x/[y] by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by [y]. Thus, the function field of X is generated by the function x/[y]."
