    "message_1": "A plane is flying at a speed of 550 mph due north while encountering a wind of 100 mph blowing in the direction of 30 degrees east of south. Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the plane.",
    "message_2": "To find the resultant velocity of the plane, we need to break down the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity into their x and y components, and then add them together.\n\nPlane's velocity:\nSince the plane is flying due north, its x-component is 0 and its y-component is 550 mph.\nVp_x = 0 mph\nVp_y = 550 mph\n\nWind's velocity:\nThe wind is blowing 30 degrees east of south. We can break this down into x and y components using trigonometry.\nVw_x = 100 * sin(30) = 50 mph (east)\nVw_y = -100 * cos(30) = -86.60254037844387 mph (south, hence the negative sign)\n\nNow, we can find the resultant velocity by adding the x and y components of the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity.\nVr_x = Vp_x + Vw_x = 0 + 50 = 50 mph\nVr_y = Vp_y + Vw_y = 550 - 86.60254037844387 = 463.3974596215561 mph\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity using the Pythagorean theorem:\nVr = sqrt(Vr_x^2 + Vr_y^2) = sqrt(50^2 + 463.3974596215561^2) = sqrt(2500 + 214738.421875) = sqrt(217238.421875) ≈ 465.87 mph\n\nTo find the direction of the resultant velocity, we can use the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(Vr_y / Vr_x) = arctan(463.3974596215561 / 50) = arctan(9.267949192431122) ≈ 84.29 degrees\n\nSince the angle is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, the direction of the resultant velocity is approximately 84.29 degrees north of east.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant velocity of the plane is approximately 465.87 mph, and its direction is approximately 84.29 degrees north of east."
