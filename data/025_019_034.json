    "message_2": "The Fano variety in question is a complete intersection of a hyperplane (degree 1) and a quadric (degree 2) in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. To find the degree of this Fano variety, we can use the formula for the degree of a complete intersection:\n\nDegree = product of the degrees of the hypersurfaces\n\nIn this case, the degree of the Fano variety is the product of the degree of the hyperplane (1) and the degree of the quadric (2):\n\nDegree = 1 * 2 = 2\n\nSo, the degree of the Fano variety that is the complete intersection of a hyperplane and a quadric in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is 2."
