    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of Team A winning exactly 3 games in a best-of-5 series, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of winning exactly k games\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n games taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of winning a single game\n- n is the total number of games played\n- k is the number of games won\n\nIn this case, Team A needs to win 3 games out of 5, so n = 5 and k = 3. The probability of winning a single game is 0.6, so p = 0.6.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(5, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 games out of 5:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!)\nC(5, 3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nNow we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.6)^3 * (1-0.6)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.6)^3 * (0.4)^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.216 * 0.16\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.03456\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.3456\n\nSo the probability that Team A wins the series by winning exactly 3 games is approximately 0.3456 or 34.56%."
