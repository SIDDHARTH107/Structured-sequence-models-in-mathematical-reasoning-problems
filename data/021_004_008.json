    "message_2": "The forward difference formula is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nIn this case, f(x) = cos(x), x = 0, and h = 0.1. So we need to calculate f(0) and f(0.1) and then use the formula to approximate f'(x).\n\nf(0) = cos(0) = 1\nf(0.1) = cos(0.1) ≈ 0.995004\n\nNow, we can use the forward difference formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(0.1) - f(0)) / 0.1\nf'(x) ≈ (0.995004 - 1) / 0.1\nf'(x) ≈ -0.004996 / 0.1\nf'(x) ≈ -0.04996\n\nSo, the approximate value of f'(x) using the forward difference formula with step size h = 0.1 at x = 0 is -0.04996."
