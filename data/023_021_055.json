    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse, we first need to define the pulse function. Let's denote the pulse function as p(t), which is defined as:\n\np(t) = 10V for -2μs ≤ t ≤ 2μs\np(t) = 0V otherwise\n\nThe Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nIn our case, f(t) = p(t). So, the Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse is:\n\nP(ω) = ∫[p(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nWe only need to consider the interval where p(t) is non-zero, i.e., -2μs ≤ t ≤ 2μs:\n\nP(ω) = ∫[-2μs to 2μs] [10V * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nP(ω) = 10V * ∫[-2μs to 2μs] [e^(-jωt)] dt\nP(ω) = 10V * [-j/(ω) * e^(-jωt)] | from -2μs to 2μs\nP(ω) = 10V * [-j/(ω) * (e^(-jω(2μs)) - e^(jω(2μs)))]\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nP(ω) = 10V * [-j/(ω) * (2j * sin(ω(2μs)))]\n\nThe j's cancel out, and we get:\n\nP(ω) = 20V/ω * sin(ω(2μs))\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse. The corresponding frequency components can be found by analyzing the function P(ω). The function has a sinc-like shape, with the main lobe centered at ω = 0 and nulls at integer multiples of π/(2μs). The amplitude of the frequency components decreases as 1/ω, so the higher frequency components have smaller amplitudes. The main frequency components are near the baseband (ω = 0), and the higher frequency components contribute less to the overall waveform."
