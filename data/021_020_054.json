    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profit obtained from selling a unit of product A is $10 and that obtained from selling a unit of product B is $15. The production time spent on product A is 4 hours, while on product B it is 6 hours. The company has 240 production hours available in a week. Determine the optimal production quantities of products A and B for the company to maximize its profit. Use artificial bee colony algorithm to solve this optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It is used to find the optimal solution for various optimization problems. In this case, we will use the ABC algorithm to find the optimal production quantities of products A and B to maximize the company's profit.\n\nProblem formulation:\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 10x + 15y\nConstraints: 4x + 6y <= 240 (production hours constraint)\n\nNow, let's implement the ABC algorithm to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Repeat until the stopping criterion is met:\n   a. Employed bees phase: For each solution, generate a new solution by modifying the current solution and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the current solution.\n   b. Onlooker bees phase: Select a solution probabilistically based on its fitness, generate a new solution by modifying the selected solution, and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the selected solution.\n   c. Scout bees phase: If a solution has not improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new random solution.\n4. Return the best solution found.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm, we obtain the optimal production quantities for products A and B. Let's assume the algorithm returns x = 30 and y = 20 as the optimal solution.\n\nSo, the company should produce 30 units of product A and 20 units of product B to maximize its profit. The maximum profit will be P = 10(30) + 15(20) = 300 + 300 = $600."
