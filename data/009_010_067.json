The risk-free interest rate is 4% per year, and the strike price of a call option with a maturity of one year is $110. Calculate the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation for financial derivatives.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to first find the values of d1 and d2, which are given by the following formulas:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere S is the current stock price, K is the strike price, r is the risk-free interest rate, σ is the volatility, and T is the time to maturity.\n\nIn this case, S = 100, K = 110, r = 0.04, σ = 0.20, and T = 1.\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.04 + (0.20^2)/2) * 1) / (0.20 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.06) / 0.20\nd1 = -0.0353 / 0.20\nd1 = -0.1765\n\nd2 = -0.1765 - 0.20 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = -0.3765\n\nNow, we can calculate the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation:\n\nCall price = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nwhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nN(-0.1765) = 0.4299\nN(-0.3765) = 0.3533\n\nNow, we can calculate the call price:\n\nCall price = 100 * 0.4299 - 110 * e^(-0.04 * 1) * 0.3533\nCall price = 42.99 - 110 * 0.9608 * 0.3533\nCall price = 42.99 - 36.96\nCall price = 6.03\n\nTherefore, the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation is approximately $6.03."
