    "message_2": "To maximize the volume of the box, we need to find the optimal value of x. When we cut the squares from the corners and fold the flaps up, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength = (30 - 2x) cm\nWidth = (20 - 2x) cm\nHeight = x cm\n\nThe volume of the box, V, can be expressed as:\n\nV = Length × Width × Height\nV = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)x\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nV = 4x^3 - 100x^2 + 600x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the volume equation with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndV/dx = 12x^2 - 200x + 600\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n12x^2 - 200x + 600 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n4x(3x - 50) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 0 and x = 50/3. However, x = 0 does not make sense in this context, as it would result in no box being formed. Therefore, we consider the other solution:\n\nx = 50/3 ≈ 16.67 cm\n\nHowever, since the width of the cardboard is 20 cm, cutting squares of 16.67 cm would not be possible. In this case, we need to consider the constraint that x must be less than or equal to half of the smaller side (20 cm) of the cardboard:\n\nx ≤ 20/2 = 10 cm\n\nThus, the maximum value of x that can be used to form a box is 10 cm. This will result in a box with dimensions:\n\nLength = 30 - 2(10) = 10 cm\nWidth = 20 - 2(10) = 0 cm\nHeight = 10 cm\n\nHowever, this would result in a box with no width, which is not a valid box. Therefore, we need to find the largest value of x that still allows for a valid box to be formed. This would be slightly less than 10 cm, such as 9.99 cm. In practice, the value of x should be chosen as close to 10 cm as possible without reaching it, in order to maximize the volume of the box."
