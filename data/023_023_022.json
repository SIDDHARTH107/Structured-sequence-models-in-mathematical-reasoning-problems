    "message_1": "Suppose you have a network with an input signal of the form: x(t) = 4cos(1000πt) + 6cos(2000πt) + 8cos(3000πt) + 2cos(4000πt). Using Fourier transformation analysis, find the frequency components present in the input signal and their corresponding amplitudes.",
    "message_2": "The given input signal x(t) is already in the form of a sum of cosine functions, which represent the frequency components of the signal. Each term in the sum has the form A*cos(2πft), where A is the amplitude, f is the frequency, and t is the time variable.\n\nx(t) = 4cos(1000πt) + 6cos(2000πt) + 8cos(3000πt) + 2cos(4000πt)\n\nWe can identify the frequency components and their corresponding amplitudes directly from the given expression:\n\n1. Frequency component 1: f1 = 500 Hz, Amplitude A1 = 4\n2. Frequency component 2: f2 = 1000 Hz, Amplitude A2 = 6\n3. Frequency component 3: f3 = 1500 Hz, Amplitude A3 = 8\n4. Frequency component 4: f4 = 2000 Hz, Amplitude A4 = 2\n\nSo, the input signal x(t) has four frequency components with frequencies 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, and 2000 Hz, and their corresponding amplitudes are 4, 6, 8, and 2, respectively."
