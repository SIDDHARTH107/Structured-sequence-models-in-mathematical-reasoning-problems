    "message_2": "To determine the number of odd entries in the sixth row of Pascal's triangle, we can use the concept of powers of 2. The nth row of Pascal's triangle corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (x+y)^(n-1). In this case, n = 6, so we are looking at the coefficients of (x+y)^5.\n\nThe binomial expansion of (x+y)^5 is given by:\n\nC(5,0)x^5 + C(5,1)x^4y + C(5,2)x^3y^2 + C(5,3)x^2y^3 + C(5,4)xy^4 + C(5,5)y^5\n\nWhere C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the coefficients for the sixth row:\n\nC(5,0) = 5! / (0!5!) = 1\nC(5,1) = 5! / (1!4!) = 5\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2!3!) = 10\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3!2!) = 10\nC(5,4) = 5! / (4!1!) = 5\nC(5,5) = 5! / (5!0!) = 1\n\nThe sixth row of Pascal's triangle is: 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1\n\nNow, let's count the odd entries:\n\n1, 5, and 1 are odd.\n\nThere are 3 odd entries in the sixth row of Pascal's triangle."
