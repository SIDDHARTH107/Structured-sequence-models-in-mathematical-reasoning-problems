    "message_2": "There are 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 48. Their structures are as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_48\nThis is the group of order 48 with elements generated by a single element, say g, such that g^48 = 1. It has a structure of Z_48.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_24 × C_2\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 24 and a cyclic group of order 2. Its structure can be represented as Z_24 × Z_2.\n\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_8 × C_2 × C_3\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 8, a cyclic group of order 2, and a cyclic group of order 3. Its structure can be represented as Z_8 × Z_2 × Z_3.\n\n4. Semidirect product of C_16 and C_3: C_16 ⋊ C_3\nThis group is formed by taking the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 3. It has a non-abelian structure.\n\n5. Semidirect product of C_4 × C_4 and C_3: (C_4 × C_4) ⋊ C_3\nThis group is formed by taking the semidirect product of the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 3. It also has a non-abelian structure.\n\n6. Semidirect product of C_8 × C_2 and C_3: (C_8 × C_2) ⋊ C_3\nThis group is formed by taking the semidirect product of the direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2, with a cyclic group of order 3. It has a non-abelian structure as well.\n\nThese are the 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 48 and their structures."
