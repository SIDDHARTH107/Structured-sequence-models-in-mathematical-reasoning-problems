    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 4, 5}. Find (A ∆ B) x C and (B ∆ A) x C, where C = {6, 7}. Show that the symmetric difference of A and B with respect to C is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 3} ∪ {4, 5} = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and C, denoted as (A ∆ B) x C. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, c) where a is in A ∆ B and c is in C.\n\n(A ∆ B) x C = {(1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}\n\nNext, we find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B ∆ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, B ∆ A is equal to A ∆ B.\n\nB ∆ A = A ∆ B = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of (B ∆ A) and C, denoted as (B ∆ A) x C.\n\n(B ∆ A) x C = {(1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that (A ∆ B) x C is equal to (B ∆ A) x C:\n\n(A ∆ B) x C = (B ∆ A) x C = {(1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference of A and B with respect to C is commutative in this case."
