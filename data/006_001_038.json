    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 5 heads and 5 tails in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips), which is 10 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads), which is 5 in this case\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n)\n- k! is the factorial of k\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(5) = (10! / (5!(10-5)!)) * (0.5^5) * (0.5^(10-5))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorials and the binomial coefficient:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nNow, let's calculate the binomial coefficient:\n\n(10! / (5!5!)) = 3,628,800 / (120 × 120) = 252\n\nNext, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.5^5) = 0.03125\n(0.5^5) = 0.03125\n\nFinally, let's plug everything into the formula:\n\nP(5) = 252 * 0.03125 * 0.03125 = 0.24609375\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 5 heads and 5 tails in 10 coin flips is approximately 24.61%."
