    "message_1": "A job seeker has two possible levels of productivity, High (H) and Low (L), with equal probability. The employer can offer a wage of either $50 or $100. If the employer offers $100, the High productivity worker will accept the job while the Low productivity worker will reject it. Conversely, if the employer offers $50, the Low productivity worker will accept the job while the High productivity worker will reject it. What is the employer's expected profit if he offers a wage of $X?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the profit generated by a High productivity worker as P_H and the profit generated by a Low productivity worker as P_L. We are given that the employer can offer a wage of either $50 or $100, and the workers' responses to these wages. We need to find the employer's expected profit if he offers a wage of $X.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two cases:\n\n1. If the employer offers a wage of $100:\n- The High productivity worker will accept the job, generating a profit of P_H - $100.\n- The Low productivity worker will reject the job, generating a profit of $0.\n\nSince there's an equal probability of having a High or Low productivity worker, the expected profit in this case is:\n\nE(P | $100) = 0.5 * (P_H - $100) + 0.5 * $0 = 0.5 * (P_H - $100)\n\n2. If the employer offers a wage of $50:\n- The High productivity worker will reject the job, generating a profit of $0.\n- The Low productivity worker will accept the job, generating a profit of P_L - $50.\n\nThe expected profit in this case is:\n\nE(P | $50) = 0.5 * $0 + 0.5 * (P_L - $50) = 0.5 * (P_L - $50)\n\nNow, let's consider the wage of $X. There are two possibilities:\n\nA. If $X = $100, the expected profit is E(P | $100) = 0.5 * (P_H - $100).\nB. If $X = $50, the expected profit is E(P | $50) = 0.5 * (P_L - $50).\n\nSo, the employer's expected profit if he offers a wage of $X is:\n\nE(P | $X) = \n  { 0.5 * (P_H - $100) if $X = $100\n  { 0.5 * (P_L - $50) if $X = $50"
