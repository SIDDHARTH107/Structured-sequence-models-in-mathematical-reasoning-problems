    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a precise numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic in mathematics. Paraconsistent logic is a non-classical logic that allows for contradictions without leading to triviality. It deals with truth values and logical connectives in a different way compared to classical logic, so the problems related to it are less likely to involve numerical computation. I suggest reframing the question to be more conceptual or theoretical.",
    "message_2": "If you are looking for a more conceptual or theoretical question related to paraconsistent logic, consider the following:\n\nIn paraconsistent logic, the principle of explosion (ex contradictione sequitur quodlibet) does not hold. This principle states that from a contradiction, any conclusion can be derived. Paraconsistent logic aims to avoid this by allowing contradictions to exist without leading to triviality (i.e., every statement being both true and false).\n\nA simple example of a paraconsistent logic system is the four-valued logic known as Belnap's logic or First Degree Entailment (FDE). In this system, there are four truth values: true (T), false (F), both true and false (B), and neither true nor false (N).\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n1. A: \"This statement is true.\"\n2. B: \"Statement A is false.\"\n\nIn classical logic, this would lead to a paradox, as A would be both true and false, and the system would become trivial. However, in Belnap's logic, we can assign the truth value B (both true and false) to statement A, and the truth value T (true) to statement B. This way, the system can handle the contradiction without leading to triviality.\n\nThe challenge in working with paraconsistent logic is to develop a consistent and useful set of rules for logical connectives and inference that can handle contradictions without trivializing the system. This often involves redefining the connectives and their properties, as well as developing new inference rules that are more robust in the face of contradictions."
