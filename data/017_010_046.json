    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C10, D5, or a non-abelian group of order 10, we will first use the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n5, must divide the order of G (which is 10) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n5 can only be 1. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is the only 5-Sylow subgroup, it is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n2, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n2 can only be 1 or 5. Let Q be a 2-Sylow subgroup of G.\n\nCase 1: n2 = 1\nIf n2 = 1, then Q is the unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G, and it is normal in G. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. By the product formula, the order of PQ is |P||Q| / |P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have prime orders 5 and 2, respectively, their intersection must be the identity element, so |P ∩ Q| = 1. Thus, |PQ| = 10, which means PQ = G. In this case, G is the direct product of P and Q, and since P and Q are cyclic of orders 5 and 2, respectively, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\nCase 2: n2 = 5\nIf n2 = 5, then there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups in G. Since each 2-Sylow subgroup has order 2, they are all cyclic and generated by an element of order 2. Let r be an element of order 2 in Q, and let s be a generator of P, so s has order 5. The order of G is 10, so any element in G can be written as a product of powers of r and s.\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5. Recall that D5 can be generated by two elements a and b, where a has order 5, b has order 2, and b * a * b = a^(-1). We will define a mapping φ: G → D5 as follows:\n\nφ(r^i * s^j) = a^j * b^i, for 0 ≤ i < 2 and 0 ≤ j < 5.\n\nWe will show that φ is an isomorphism:\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since r has order 2 and s has order 5, the elements r^i * s^j are distinct for 0 ≤ i < 2 and 0 ≤ j < 5. Thus, φ maps distinct elements in G to distinct elements in D5.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let x = r^i * s^j and y = r^k * s^l be elements in G. Then,\n\nφ(x * y) = φ(r^(i+k) * s^(j+l)) = a^(j+l) * b^(i+k) = (a^j * b^i) * (a^l * b^k).\n\nSince b * a * b = a^(-1) in D5, we can rewrite the above expression as:\n\n(a^j * b^i) * (b * a^(-l) * b^k) = (a^j * b^i) * (b * a^l * b^k) = φ(x) * φ(y).\n\nThus, φ is a homomorphism.\n\n3. φ is bijective: Since G and D5 have the same order (10), and φ is well-defined, it is enough to show that φ is either injective or surjective to conclude that it is bijective. We will show that φ is surjective. For any element a^j * b^i in D5, where 0 ≤ i < 2 and 0 ≤ j < 5, there exists an element r^i * s^j in G such that φ(r^i * s^j) = a^j * b^i. Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism and bijective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D5 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. There is no non-abelian group of order 10 other than D5, so the claim is proved."
