    "message_1": "A rectangle has a length of 8 meters and a width of 5 meters. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 meters and the width is 5 meters. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(8 + 5) = 2(13) = 26 meters.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 26 meters."
