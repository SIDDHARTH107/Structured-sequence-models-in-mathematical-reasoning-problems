    "message_2": "In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the alphabet is replaced by another unique letter. To find the number of possible keys, we need to calculate the number of ways to arrange the 26 letters in the alphabet.\n\nThis is a permutation problem, and the number of possible keys can be calculated using the formula for permutations:\n\nn! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × ... × 1\n\nIn this case, n = 26 (the number of letters in the English alphabet). So, the number of possible keys is:\n\n26! = 26 × 25 × 24 × ... × 1 = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000\n\nThere are 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possible keys for a monoalphabetic substitution cipher with 26 letters in the English alphabet."
