    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 4 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (4 cm)²\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * 16 cm²\n\nSurface area = 64π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the sphere with a radius of 4 cm is approximately 201.06 cm² (rounded to two decimal places)."
