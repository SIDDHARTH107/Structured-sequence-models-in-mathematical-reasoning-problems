    "message_1": "Let's assume we have a time-limited signal, f(t), with a duration of 10 seconds that has a Fourier transform given by F(ω)=2e^(-2πiω), where ω is the frequency variable measured in radians per second. \n\nFind the maximum frequency in the signal f(t) and determine the time interval for which the signal is zero.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum frequency in the signal f(t), we need to analyze its Fourier transform, F(ω) = 2e^(-2πiω). However, the given Fourier transform does not provide any information about the frequency content of the signal. It is a complex exponential function, which represents a continuous spectrum of frequencies. Therefore, we cannot determine the maximum frequency in the signal f(t) based on the given Fourier transform.\n\nTo determine the time interval for which the signal is zero, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω) to obtain the time-domain signal f(t):\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫ F(ω)e^(2πiωt) dω\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫ 2e^(-2πiω)e^(2πiωt) dω\n\nf(t) = (1/π) ∫ e^(2πiω(t-1)) dω\n\nThe integral above does not converge to a standard function, which means that the signal f(t) cannot be represented by a simple mathematical expression. Therefore, we cannot determine the time interval for which the signal is zero based on the given Fourier transform."
