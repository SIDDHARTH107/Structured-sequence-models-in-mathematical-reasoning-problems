    "message_2": "There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. A group of order 9 must be abelian, so it cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group. Let me prove that any group of order 9 is abelian.\n\nLet G be a group of order 9. Since 9 = 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 9\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_3 = 3, then there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, but by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is the index of the normalizer of a Sylow 3-subgroup, say P. In this case, the index is 3, which implies that the normalizer of P has order 3. But the normalizer of P must contain P, so it must have order greater than 3. This is a contradiction, so n_3 cannot be 3.\n\nThus, there must be a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. Let P be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P has order 9, it must be isomorphic to either C_9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C_3 × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). In either case, P is abelian.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since P is normal, G/P is a group, and its order is |G|/|P| = 9/9 = 1. Thus, G/P is the trivial group, which means G is isomorphic to P. Since P is abelian, G must also be abelian.\n\nSo, any group of order 9 is abelian, and it cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group."
