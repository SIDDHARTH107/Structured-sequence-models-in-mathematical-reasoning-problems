    "message_1": "In a group of volunteers, there are 5 members who agreed to contribute $10 each for a charitable cause, but only one member will be chosen to make the actual donation. If the chosen member makes the donation, they will receive recognition for their generosity. However, if no one steps up, the charitable cause will not receive any donations. Each member has a 20% chance of being chosen. What is the expected value for each member of the group if they decide to participate?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value for each member, we need to consider the possible outcomes and their probabilities. There are two possible outcomes for each member:\n\n1. They are chosen to make the donation (20% chance).\n2. They are not chosen to make the donation (80% chance).\n\nIf a member is chosen to make the donation, they will contribute $10 and receive recognition. If they are not chosen, they will still contribute $10, but they will not receive recognition.\n\nLet's assign a value to the recognition. Since it's difficult to quantify the value of recognition, we'll call it R.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value for each member:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of being chosen) * (Value if chosen) + (Probability of not being chosen) * (Value if not chosen)\n\nExpected Value = (0.20) * ($10 + R) + (0.80) * ($10)\n\nExpected Value = 0.20 * (10 + R) + 8\n\nSince we cannot quantify the value of recognition (R), the expected value for each member will be in the form of:\n\nExpected Value = 0.20 * (10 + R) + 8"
