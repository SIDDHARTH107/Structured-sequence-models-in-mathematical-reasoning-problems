    "message_1": "A math student is asked to solve the following nonlinear differential equation:\n\ndy/dx = x^3 - y^2\n\nwith the initial condition y(0) = 1.\n\nFind the solution for the differential equation and determine its behavior as x approaches infinity.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given nonlinear differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Rewrite the equation as:\n\ndy/dx = x^3 - y^2\n\nRearrange the terms to separate the variables:\n\ndy/(y^2) = x^3 dx\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫(1/y^2) dy = ∫x^3 dx\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n-1/y = (1/4)x^4 + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant of integration, C, using the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n-1/1 = (1/4)(0)^4 + C\n-1 = 0 + C\nC = -1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-1/y = (1/4)x^4 - 1\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 1/((1/4)x^4 - 1)\n\nAs x approaches infinity, the term (1/4)x^4 will dominate the denominator, causing the fraction to approach 0. Therefore, the behavior of the solution as x approaches infinity is that y(x) approaches 0."
