    "message_1": "On a road trip, the probability of getting a flat tire is 0.08. If a family plans to take 3 road trips this year, what is the probability they will have at least one flat tire during the year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of having at least one flat tire during the year, we can first find the probability of not having a flat tire on any of the trips and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not having a flat tire on a single trip is 1 - 0.08 = 0.92.\n\nFor three trips, the probability of not having a flat tire on any of them is 0.92 * 0.92 * 0.92 = 0.778688.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of having at least one flat tire during the year:\n\n1 - 0.778688 = 0.221312.\n\nSo, the probability of having at least one flat tire during the year is approximately 0.221 or 22.1%."
