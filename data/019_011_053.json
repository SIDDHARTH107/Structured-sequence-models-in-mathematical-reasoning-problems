    "message_2": "In classical logic, the truth value of the implication A→B would be true when A is false and B is true. This is because classical logic follows the material conditional, where an implication is considered false only when the antecedent (A) is true and the consequent (B) is false.\n\nHowever, in relevance logic, the implication A→B is considered true only if there is a relevant connection between A and B. Since we are given that A is relevant to B, we need to analyze the truth values of A and B.\n\nGiven that A is false and B is true, the implication A→B in relevance logic would still be considered true. This is because relevance logic preserves the classical logic's truth-functional behavior in cases where the antecedent is false. So, even though there is a relevant connection between A and B, the truth value of the implication A→B remains true when A is false and B is true."
