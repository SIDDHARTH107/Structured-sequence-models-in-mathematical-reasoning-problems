    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs produces bulbs with an average life of 1000 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. A consumer advocacy group claims that the manufacturer's bulbs do not last as long as advertised. The group randomly selects 25 bulbs and finds that the sample has a mean life of 970 hours. Can the group's claim be supported at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the group's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean life of the bulbs is equal to 1000 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean life of the bulbs is less than 1000 hours.\n\nGiven information:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 1000 hours\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 100 hours\nSample mean (x̄) = 970 hours\nSample size (n) = 25\nLevel of significance (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is 25, which is relatively small, we will use the t-distribution instead of the z-distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nt = (970 - 1000) / (100 / √25)\nt = (-30) / (100 / 5)\nt = -30 / 20\nt = -1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24) and a 5% level of significance. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.71.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-1.5) is greater than the critical t-value (-1.71), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is not enough evidence at the 5% level of significance to support the consumer advocacy group's claim that the manufacturer's bulbs do not last as long as advertised."
