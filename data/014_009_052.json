    "message_1": "Suppose you are using a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and 16 rounds. If the key size is 128 bits, how many bits are required for each subkey and what is the total number of subkeys needed for encryption?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher with 16 rounds, you will need one subkey for each round, so a total of 16 subkeys are needed for encryption. Since the key size is 128 bits, and you need 16 subkeys, you can divide the key size by the number of subkeys to find the number of bits required for each subkey:\n\n128 bits / 16 subkeys = 8 bits per subkey\n\nSo, each subkey requires 8 bits, and a total of 16 subkeys are needed for encryption."
