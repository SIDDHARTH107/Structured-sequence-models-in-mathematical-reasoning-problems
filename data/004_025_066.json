    "message_1": "A car starting from rest accelerated uniformly along a straight line away from traffic lights. After 6 seconds, it reached a speed of 25 m/s. What was the car's acceleration?",
    "message_2": "To find the car's acceleration, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal velocity (v) = Initial velocity (u) + Acceleration (a) × Time (t)\n\nSince the car starts from rest, the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s. We are given the final velocity (v) as 25 m/s and the time (t) as 6 seconds. We need to find the acceleration (a).\n\n25 m/s = 0 m/s + a × 6 s\n\nNow, we can solve for the acceleration (a):\n\n25 m/s = a × 6 s\na = (25 m/s) / 6 s\na ≈ 4.17 m/s²\n\nThe car's acceleration is approximately 4.17 m/s²."
