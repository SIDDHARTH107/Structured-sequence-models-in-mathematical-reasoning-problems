    "message_2": "To find the impulse response of the system, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function H(s). The transfer function is given by:\n\nH(s) = 3/(s^3 + 5s^2 + 6s)\n\nFirst, we need to perform partial fraction decomposition on H(s). To do this, we can rewrite H(s) as:\n\nH(s) = 3/(s(s^2 + 5s + 6))\n\nNow, we factor the quadratic term in the denominator:\n\nH(s) = 3/(s(s + 2)(s + 3))\n\nNow, we can express H(s) as a sum of partial fractions:\n\nH(s) = A/s + B/(s + 2) + C/(s + 3)\n\nTo find the constants A, B, and C, we can multiply both sides by the common denominator and equate the numerators:\n\n3 = A(s + 2)(s + 3) + B(s)(s + 3) + C(s)(s + 2)\n\nNow, we can solve for A, B, and C by substituting suitable values for s:\n\n1. s = 0: 3 = 6A => A = 1/2\n2. s = -2: 3 = 2B => B = 3/2\n3. s = -3: 3 = 3C => C = 1\n\nNow we have:\n\nH(s) = (1/2)/s + (3/2)/(s + 2) + 1/(s + 3)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of H(s) to obtain the impulse response h(t):\n\nh(t) = L^(-1){H(s)} = (1/2)L^(-1){1/s} + (3/2)L^(-1){1/(s + 2)} + L^(-1){1/(s + 3)}\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform properties and tables, we get:\n\nh(t) = (1/2)(1) + (3/2)e^(-2t) + e^(-3t) for t ≥ 0\n\nNow, to determine the stability of the system, we need to check if the impulse response is absolutely integrable. In other words, we need to check if the following integral converges:\n\n∫(h(t))dt from 0 to ∞\n\n∫((1/2) + (3/2)e^(-2t) + e^(-3t))dt from 0 to ∞\n\nThis integral can be split into three separate integrals:\n\n(1/2)∫(1)dt from 0 to ∞ + (3/2)∫(e^(-2t))dt from 0 to ∞ + ∫(e^(-3t))dt from 0 to ∞\n\nThe first integral diverges, as the integral of a constant from 0 to ∞ is infinite. Therefore, the impulse response is not absolutely integrable, and the system is not stable."
