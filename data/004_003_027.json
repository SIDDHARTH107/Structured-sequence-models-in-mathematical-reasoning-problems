    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the box be length (l), width (w), and height (h). The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = lwh = 150 cubic centimeters\n\nThe cost of the material for the bottom is $0.02 per square centimeter, and the cost for the sides is $0.01 per square centimeter. Therefore, the total cost (C) can be expressed as:\n\nC = 0.02lw + 0.01(2lh + 2wh)\n\nWe want to minimize the cost, so we'll use calculus. First, we need to eliminate one of the variables. We can do this by solving the volume equation for one of the variables, say h:\n\nh = 150 / (lw)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the cost equation:\n\nC = 0.02lw + 0.01(2l(150/(lw)) + 2w(150/(lw)))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nC = 0.02lw + 0.01(300/l + 300/w)\n\nNow, we'll find the partial derivatives of C with respect to l and w:\n\n∂C/∂l = 0.02w - 0.01(300/l^2)\n∂C/∂w = 0.02l - 0.01(300/w^2)\n\nTo find the critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for l and w:\n\n0.02w = 0.01(300/l^2)\n0.02l = 0.01(300/w^2)\n\nRearrange the equations:\n\nw = 150/l^2\nl = 150/w^2\n\nNow, substitute w from the first equation into the second equation:\n\nl = 150/(150/l^2)^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nl^5 = 150^3\n\nTake the fifth root of both sides:\n\nl = (150^3)^(1/5)\n\nCalculate the value of l:\n\nl ≈ 3.107\n\nNow, substitute the value of l back into the equation for w:\n\nw = 150/l^2\nw ≈ 150/(3.107^2)\nw ≈ 4.643\n\nFinally, substitute the values of l and w back into the equation for h:\n\nh = 150 / (lw)\nh ≈ 150 / (3.107 * 4.643)\nh ≈ 10.392\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will minimize the material costs are approximately:\n\nlength (l) ≈ 3.107 cm\nwidth (w) ≈ 4.643 cm\nheight (h) ≈ 10.392 cm"
