    "message_2": "In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the ratio of the side lengths is 1 : âˆš3 : 2. Since the shorter leg is 6 cm, we can set up the proportion:\n\nShorter leg : Hypotenuse = 1 : 2\n6 : Hypotenuse = 1 : 2\n\nTo find the length of the hypotenuse, we can cross-multiply and solve for the hypotenuse:\n\n6 * 2 = 1 * Hypotenuse\n12 = Hypotenuse\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 12 cm."
