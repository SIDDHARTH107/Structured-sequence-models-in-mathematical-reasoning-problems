    "message_2": "To graph the function y = 2sin(3x) for x from 0 to 2π, we need to understand the properties of the sine function and how the coefficients affect its graph.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is |2| = 2. This means the graph will oscillate between -2 and 2.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient inside the sine function, which is the value multiplied by the variable x. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The period of the basic sine function is 2π, so to find the period of y = 2sin(3x), we divide the basic period by the coefficient: (2π)/3. Therefore, the period of the function is (2π)/3.\n\nPhase Shift:\nThe phase shift is the horizontal shift of the sine function. In this case, there is no phase shift because there is no constant added or subtracted inside the sine function. So, the phase shift is 0.\n\nNow, to graph the function, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Mark the amplitude on the y-axis: 2 and -2.\n2. Mark the period on the x-axis: (2π)/3.\n3. Since there is no phase shift, the graph starts at the origin (0,0).\n4. The sine function has a characteristic wave shape, so we can draw the wave starting at the origin, reaching the maximum amplitude at (π/6, 2), crossing the x-axis again at (π/3, 0), reaching the minimum amplitude at (π/2, -2), and finally crossing the x-axis again at (2π/3, 0) to complete one period.\n5. Repeat the wave shape for the remaining interval until x = 2π.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π)/3, and the phase shift is 0."
