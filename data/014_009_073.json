    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher structure that uses a block size of 64 bits, a key size of 128 bits, and a round function that consists of 8 rounds. If we encrypt a plaintext message using this cipher and the same secret key, how many times is each 32-bit half-block processed through the round function during the encryption process?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the block size is divided into two equal-sized halves. In this case, the block size is 64 bits, so each half-block is 32 bits. During each round of the encryption process, one half-block is processed through the round function while the other half remains unchanged. Then, the roles of the two halves are swapped for the next round.\n\nSince there are 8 rounds in this Feistel cipher, each 32-bit half-block will be processed through the round function 8 times during the encryption process."
