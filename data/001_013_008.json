    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x+3) = 4, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n\n(√(2x+3))^2 = 4^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x + 3 = 16\n\nNow, we will solve for x by isolating the variable. First, subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n2x = 13\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 13/2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 13/2."
