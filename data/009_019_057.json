    "message_2": "To find the expected value of X(1), we can use the property of the expected value of a stochastic process:\n\nE[X(t)] = X(0) + ∫₀ᵗ E[dX(s)]\n\nGiven the stochastic differential equation:\n\ndX(t) = -0.5*X(t) dt + 2*dB(t)\n\nWe can find the expected value of dX(t):\n\nE[dX(t)] = E[-0.5*X(t) dt + 2*dB(t)]\n\nSince the expected value of the Brownian motion increment dB(t) is zero, we have:\n\nE[dX(t)] = -0.5*E[X(t)] dt\n\nNow we can use the property of the expected value of a stochastic process:\n\nE[X(t)] = X(0) + ∫₀ᵗ E[dX(s)]\n\nE[X(t)] = 1 + ∫₀ᵗ -0.5*E[X(s)] ds\n\nTo solve this integral equation, we can differentiate both sides with respect to t:\n\ndE[X(t)]/dt = -0.5*E[X(t)]\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). We can solve it using an integrating factor. Let the integrating factor be:\n\nI(t) = exp(∫ -0.5 dt) = exp(-0.5t)\n\nMultiply both sides of the ODE by the integrating factor:\n\nI(t) * dE[X(t)]/dt + 0.5 * I(t) * E[X(t)] = 0\n\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product of I(t) and E[X(t)]:\n\nd/dt (I(t) * E[X(t)]) = 0\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\nI(t) * E[X(t)] = C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. Now we can solve for E[X(t)]:\n\nE[X(t)] = C * exp(0.5t)\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition X(0) = 1:\n\nE[X(0)] = C * exp(0.5*0) = C\n\nSo, C = 1. Therefore, the expected value of X(t) is:\n\nE[X(t)] = exp(0.5t)\n\nFinally, we can find the expected value of X(1):\n\nE[X(1)] = exp(0.5*1) = exp(0.5) ≈ 1.64872"
