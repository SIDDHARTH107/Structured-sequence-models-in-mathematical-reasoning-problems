    "message_2": "To find the solutions for the equation 2sin(x) + √3 = 0 for x between 0 and 2π, we first isolate sin(x):\n\n2sin(x) = -√3\nsin(x) = -√3/2\n\nNow, we need to find the angles x for which the sine function equals -√3/2. Since sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we will find the reference angle in those quadrants.\n\nThe reference angle for sin(x) = √3/2 is π/3 (or 60°) because sin(π/3) = √3/2. Therefore, the angles in the third and fourth quadrants that have the same reference angle are:\n\nx1 = π + π/3 = 4π/3\nx2 = 2π - π/3 = 5π/3\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 2sin(x) + √3 = 0 for x between 0 and 2π are x = 4π/3 and x = 5π/3."
