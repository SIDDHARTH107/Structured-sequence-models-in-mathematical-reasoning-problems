    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is generated by a circle with radius 1/4. Using the formula for the area of a cardioid, A = (3/4)πr^2, we can find the area of the main cardioid.\n\nA = (3/4)π(1/4)^2\nA = (3/4)π(1/16)\nA = (3/64)π\n\nTherefore, the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is (3/64)π."
