    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, we can write it as 3^3. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, so n_3 divides 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nFrom these two conditions, we can see that the possible values for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. If n_3 = 3, then there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, and it is not guaranteed that any of them are normal in G.\n\nNow, let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is either isomorphic to C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). If P is isomorphic to C9, then G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, and G must be isomorphic to C27 by the following argument:\n\nLet a be a generator of P, so that P = ⟨a⟩ and a^9 = 1. Since P is normal in G, we can form the factor group G/P. The order of G/P is |G|/|P| = 27/9 = 3, so G/P is cyclic and isomorphic to C3. Let G/P = ⟨bP⟩, where b is an element of G and b^3 ∈ P. Then, we can write any element of G as a product of the form a^i * b^j, where 0 ≤ i < 9 and 0 ≤ j < 3.\n\nNow, consider the element a^i * b^j in G. Since a^9 = 1 and b^3 ∈ P, we have (a^i * b^j)^27 = a^(27i) * (b^j)^27 = a^(3i) * (b^3)^9 = 1. Thus, G has an element of order 27, and G must be isomorphic to C27.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then G may or may not be isomorphic to C27, depending on whether G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup. However, there is no non-abelian group of order 27, since any group of order p^3, where p is prime, is either isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p^3 or a direct product of smaller cyclic groups. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C27 in this case as well.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, regardless of the structure of its Sylow 3-subgroups."
