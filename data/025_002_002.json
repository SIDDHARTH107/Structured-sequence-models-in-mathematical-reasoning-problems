    "message_2": "To find the number of intersection points of X and Y counted with multiplicity, we will use Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two projective plane curves with no common components is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity.\n\nFirst, let's find the degrees of the curves X and Y.\n\nFor curve X: y^2z - x^3 - 4xz^2 = 0, the highest degree terms are y^2z, x^3, and 4xz^2. The degree of this curve is the maximum of the sum of the exponents of the variables in each term, which is max(2+1, 3, 1+2) = 3.\n\nFor curve Y: yz^2 - x^2z - 4y^2 = 0, the highest degree terms are yz^2, x^2z, and 4y^2. The degree of this curve is the maximum of the sum of the exponents of the variables in each term, which is max(1+2, 2+1, 2) = 3.\n\nNow, we can apply Bézout's theorem. Since the degrees of both curves are 3, the number of intersection points of X and Y counted with multiplicity is 3 * 3 = 9."
