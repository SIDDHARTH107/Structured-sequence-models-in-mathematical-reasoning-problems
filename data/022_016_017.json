    "message_2": "Since $D$ and $\\mathbb{D}$ are both open discs with the same radius, we can consider the identity function $f(z) = z$ as a candidate for the required function. Let's check if it satisfies the conditions of being bijective and analytic.\n\n1. Injective (one-to-one): If $f(z_1) = f(z_2)$, then $z_1 = z_2$. Thus, the function is injective.\n\n2. Surjective (onto): For any $w \\in \\mathbb{D}$, there exists a $z \\in D$ such that $f(z) = w$, since $D = \\mathbb{D}$. Thus, the function is surjective.\n\n3. Analytic: The identity function is analytic, as it is a polynomial function with degree 1.\n\nTherefore, the identity function $f(z) = z$ is a bijective and analytic function from $D$ to $\\mathbb{D}$."
