    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', can be found by subtracting the elements of set A from the universal set U:\n\nA' = U - A = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's verify that the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case:\n\nA ∩ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nThere are no common elements between set A and its complement A', so their intersection is the empty set:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThus, we have verified that the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set."
