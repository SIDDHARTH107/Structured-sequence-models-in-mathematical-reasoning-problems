    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x) = x over the interval [-π, π], we first need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. So, we only need to compute the b_n coefficients.\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nTo compute the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx = [-x * (1/n) * cos(nx)] [-π, π] - ∫[-π, π] (-1/n) * cos(nx) dx\n\nThe first term evaluates to:\n\n[-π * (1/n) * cos(nπ) - (-π * (1/n) * cos(-nπ))] = 2π²/n for n odd, and 0 for n even.\n\nThe second term is zero because the integral of cos(nx) over a full period is zero.\n\nSo, b_n = (2π²/n) for odd n and 0 for even n.\n\nNow we can write the first 5 nonzero terms of the Fourier series:\n\nf(x) ≈ (2π²/1) * sin(1x) + (2π²/3) * sin(3x) + (2π²/5) * sin(5x) + (2π²/7) * sin(7x) + (2π²/9) * sin(9x)\n\nFor pointwise convergence, we need to check if the Fourier series converges to f(x) = x at each point in the interval [-π, π]. Since f(x) is continuous and has a finite number of discontinuities in its derivative, the Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) at every point in the interval [-π, π] by the Dirichlet's theorem. However, note that the convergence may not be uniform."
