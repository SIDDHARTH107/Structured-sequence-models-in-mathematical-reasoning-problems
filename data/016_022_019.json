    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid is a fractal structure that is formed by repeatedly removing the central pyramid of the previous iteration. The number of black squares in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of black squares = (previous number of black squares) * 4\n\nFor the initial pyramid (iteration 0), there are 9 black squares (3 squares on each side of the base and 1 layer).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of black squares for each iteration:\n\nIteration 1: 9 * 4 = 36 black squares\nIteration 2: 36 * 4 = 144 black squares\nIteration 3: 144 * 4 = 576 black squares\nIteration 4: 576 * 4 = 2304 black squares\nIteration 5: 2304 * 4 = 9216 black squares\n\nSo, after 5 iterations, there are 9216 black squares in the Sierpinski pyramid."
