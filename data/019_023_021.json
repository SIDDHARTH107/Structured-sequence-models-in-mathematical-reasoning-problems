    "message_2": "The given sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2 between consecutive terms. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nwhere an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the position of the term in the sequence, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, a1 = 2 and d = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nan = 2 + (n - 1)2\n\nSimplifying the formula, we have:\n\nan = 2 + 2n - 2\n\nan = 2n\n\nSo, the formula for the nth term of this sequence in terms of n is an = 2n."
