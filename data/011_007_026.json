How many possible committees can the company form if:\n1) all employees are eligible to be on the committee;\n2) one employee is not available to be on the committee; \n3) two employees refuse to attend the meeting together and cannot be in the same committee? \n\n(Note: This problem can be solved using the concept of combinations and recurrence relations.)",
    "message_2": "1) If all employees are eligible to be on the committee, we can use the combination formula to find the number of possible committees. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 5 (total employees) and k = 3 (committee members).\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 10 possible committees.\n\n2) If one employee is not available to be on the committee, we now have 4 employees to choose from. We can use the same combination formula with n = 4 and k = 3.\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 24 / (6 * 1) = 4 possible committees.\n\n3) If two employees refuse to attend the meeting together, we can consider two cases: one of them is on the committee, and neither of them is on the committee.\n\nCase 1: One of the two employees is on the committee. We have 3 spots to fill, and one of them is already taken by one of the two employees. We have 3 remaining employees to choose from for the other 2 spots. Using the combination formula with n = 3 and k = 2:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 6 / (2 * 1) = 3 possible committees.\n\nSince there are 2 employees who refuse to attend together, we have 2 * 3 = 6 possible committees for this case.\n\nCase 2: Neither of the two employees is on the committee. We now have 3 employees to choose from for all 3 spots. Using the combination formula with n = 3 and k = 3:\n\nC(3, 3) = 3! / (3!(3-3)!) = 6 / (6 * 1) = 1 possible committee.\n\nAdding the possibilities from both cases, we have 6 + 1 = 7 possible committees.\n\nIn summary:\n1) 10 possible committees when all employees are eligible.\n2) 4 possible committees when one employee is not available.\n3) 7 possible committees when two employees refuse to attend the meeting together."
