Since B contains single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is an empty set:\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = ∅\n\nNow we can see that:\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = ∅\nA × (B ∩ A) = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nSince (A × B) ∩ B ≠ A × (B ∩ A), the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
