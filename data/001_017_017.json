    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+2) + log(x-1) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the product rule for logarithms, log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), we get:\n\nlog((x+2)(x-1)) = 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n10^2 = (x+2)(x-1)\n\n100 = x^2 - x - 2x + 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation and set it equal to zero:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 - 100 = 0\n\nx^2 - 3x - 98 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 14)(x + 7) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 14 = 0 => x = 14\nx + 7 = 0 => x = -7\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. If we plug in x = 14:\n\nlog(14+2) + log(14-1) = log(16) + log(13) â‰ˆ 2.204 + 1.114 = 2.318\n\nThis does not equal 2, so x = 14 is not a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's plug in x = -7:\n\nlog(-7+2) + log(-7-1) = log(-5) + log(-8)\n\nSince the logarithm of a negative number is undefined, x = -7 is also not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, there are no valid solutions for x in the given equation."
