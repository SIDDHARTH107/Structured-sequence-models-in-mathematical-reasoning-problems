    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 5sin(2x) - cos(3x), we will apply the chain rule for each term.\n\nFor the first term, 5sin(2x), let u = 2x. Then, the derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), and the derivative of u with respect to x is 2. So, by the chain rule, the derivative of 5sin(2x) with respect to x is 5 * cos(2x) * 2 = 10cos(2x).\n\nFor the second term, -cos(3x), let v = 3x. Then, the derivative of -cos(v) with respect to v is sin(v), and the derivative of v with respect to x is 3. So, by the chain rule, the derivative of -cos(3x) with respect to x is sin(3x) * 3 = 3sin(3x).\n\nNow, we can combine the derivatives of both terms to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 10cos(2x) + 3sin(3x)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = π/6:\n\nf'(π/6) = 10cos(2(π/6)) + 3sin(3(π/6))\nf'(π/6) = 10cos(π/3) + 3sin(π/2)\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2 and sin(π/2) = 1, so:\n\nf'(π/6) = 10(1/2) + 3(1)\nf'(π/6) = 5 + 3\nf'(π/6) = 8\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 5sin(2x) - cos(3x) at x = π/6 is 8."
