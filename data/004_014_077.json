    "message_2": "To find the volume of water in the tank when it is filled to a depth of 3 meters, we first need to find the radius of the water level at that depth. We can use similar triangles to do this.\n\nLet the radius of the water level be r. Since the height of the tank is 5 meters and the radius at the top is 2 meters, we can set up a proportion:\n\nr / 3 = 2 / 5\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n5r = 6\n\nDividing by 5, we find the radius of the water level:\n\nr = 6 / 5 = 1.2 meters\n\nNow that we have the radius of the water level, we can find the volume of water in the tank using the formula for the volume of a cone:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nWhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. Plugging in the values we found:\n\nV = (1/3)π(1.2)^2(3)\n\nV ≈ (1/3)π(1.44)(3)\n\nV ≈ π(1.44)\n\nV ≈ 4.52 cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of water in the tank when it is filled to a depth of 3 meters is approximately 4.52 cubic meters."
