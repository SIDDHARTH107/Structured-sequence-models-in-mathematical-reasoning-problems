    "message_2": "A topological space is called a Hausdorff space (or T2 space) if for any two distinct points x and y in the space, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nLet's check if this condition holds for the given topological space X with topology T.\n\nConsider the points b and c in X. We need to find disjoint open sets U and V such that b ∈ U and c ∈ V. However, looking at the topology T, we can see that there are no open sets containing b that do not also contain c, and vice versa. Specifically, the only open sets containing b are {a, b, c, d} and {b, d}, both of which also contain c.\n\nSince we cannot find disjoint open sets for the points b and c, the topological space (X, T) is not a Hausdorff space."
