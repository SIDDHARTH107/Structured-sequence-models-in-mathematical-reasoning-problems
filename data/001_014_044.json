    "message_2": "To simplify the given radical expression √(64x^4y^8), we need to find the square root of each component (coefficient and variables) inside the radical.\n\n1. Square root of the coefficient:\n√64 = 8\n\n2. Square root of the variables:\nFor x^4, the square root is x^(4/2) = x^2.\nFor y^8, the square root is y^(8/2) = y^4.\n\nNow, combine the simplified components:\n8x^2y^4\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 8x^2y^4."
