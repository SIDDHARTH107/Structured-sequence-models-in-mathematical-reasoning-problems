    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the restriction of the line bundle O_{P^2}(1) to the curve X, we need to compute the intersection number of X with a line in P^2.\n\nLet H be a line in P^2. Then, O_{P^2}(1) corresponds to the divisor class of H. We want to compute the intersection number X 路 H.\n\nSince X is a smooth projective cubic curve, its degree is 3. The intersection number of two curves in P^2 is given by the product of their degrees. Therefore, the intersection number X 路 H = 3 路 1 = 3.\n\nNow, we know that the degree of the restriction of the line bundle O_{P^2}(1) to the curve X is the intersection number X 路 H. Thus, the degree of the restriction of the line bundle O_{P^2}(1) to the curve X is 3."
