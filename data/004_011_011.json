    "message_2": "Given the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = (4/3)πr^3, we want to find the rate at which the radius (r) is increasing (dr/dt) when the volume (V) is 36 cubic inches.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius when the volume is 36 cubic inches:\n\n(4/3)πr^3 = 36\n\nTo solve for r, we can first divide both sides by (4/3)π:\n\nr^3 = 36 / [(4/3)π]\nr^3 = (3/4)(36/π)\nr^3 = 27/π\n\nNow, take the cube root of both sides:\n\nr = (27/π)^(1/3)\n\nNow that we have the radius when the volume is 36 cubic inches, we can find the rate at which the radius is increasing (dr/dt). To do this, we'll differentiate the volume formula with respect to time (t):\n\ndV/dt = d/dt [(4/3)πr^3]\n\nSince (4/3)π is a constant, we can rewrite this as:\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π d/dt [r^3]\n\nNow, apply the chain rule:\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π (3r^2) (dr/dt)\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = 3 cubic inches per second. Plug this value into the equation and solve for dr/dt:\n\n3 = (4/3)π (3r^2) (dr/dt)\n\nNow, plug in the value of r we found earlier:\n\n3 = (4/3)π (3[(27/π)^(1/3)]^2) (dr/dt)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n3 = 4π (27/π)^(2/3) (dr/dt)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4π (27/π)^(2/3) to solve for dr/dt:\n\ndr/dt = 3 / [4π (27/π)^(2/3)]\n\ndr/dt ≈ 0.0573 inches per second\n\nSo, the rate at which the radius of the balloon is increasing when the volume is 36 cubic inches is approximately 0.0573 inches per second."
