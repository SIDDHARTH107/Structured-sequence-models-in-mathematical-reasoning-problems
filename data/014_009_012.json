    "message_1": "Suppose we are using a Feistel cipher with 16 rounds, and we want to encrypt a 64-bit plaintext into a 64-bit ciphertext. Each round uses a 48-bit subkey. Assuming the initial permutation and final permutation both take negligible time, what is the total number of bits transmitted during the encryption process?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher with 16 rounds, each round uses a 48-bit subkey. Therefore, the total number of bits in the subkeys is 16 rounds * 48 bits/round = 768 bits.\n\nThe 64-bit plaintext is encrypted into a 64-bit ciphertext, so there are 64 bits transmitted for the plaintext and 64 bits transmitted for the ciphertext.\n\nThus, the total number of bits transmitted during the encryption process is 768 bits (subkeys) + 64 bits (plaintext) + 64 bits (ciphertext) = 896 bits."
