    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order 47 is cyclic, we will use the fact that 47 is a prime number.\n\nLet G be a group of order 47. Since 47 is a prime number, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must be a divisor of 47. The only divisors of 47 are 1 and 47. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and 47.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G, where g is not the identity element. The subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has order equal to the order of g. Since g is not the identity element, the order of ⟨g⟩ cannot be 1. Therefore, the order of ⟨g⟩ must be 47.\n\nSince ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, it must be the case that ⟨g⟩ = G. This means that G is generated by a single element g, and thus G is a cyclic group.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 47 is cyclic."
