    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 4 in the interval [-1, 4], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(3x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 1/3 and x = 2. These are the critical points.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 4 = -1 - 3 - 2 + 4 = -2\nf(1/3) = (1/3)^3 - 3(1/3)^2 + 2(1/3) + 4 â‰ˆ 0.037 - 1 + 0.6667 + 4 = 3.7037\nf(2) = 2^3 - 3(2)^2 + 2(2) + 4 = 8 - 12 + 4 + 4 = 4\nf(4) = 4^3 - 3(4)^2 + 2(4) + 4 = 64 - 48 + 8 + 4 = 28\n\nComparing the values, we find that the minimum value of the function in the interval [-1, 4] is -2 at x = -1, and the maximum value is 28 at x = 4."
