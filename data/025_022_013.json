    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points $(2,4)$, $(6,10)$, and $(8,16)$, we first need to check if these points are collinear (i.e., they lie on the same straight line).\n\nLet's calculate the slope between the first two points and the slope between the second and third points:\n\nSlope between $(2,4)$ and $(6,10)$:\n$m_1 = \\frac{10 - 4}{6 - 2} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nSlope between $(6,10)$ and $(8,16)$:\n$m_2 = \\frac{16 - 10}{8 - 6} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$\n\nSince the slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ are not equal, the three points are not collinear, and there is no line that passes through all three points in the algebraic variety $V$. Therefore, it is not possible to find an equation of a line passing through these points in the derived category of $V$."
