    "message_1": "In a study on the heights of 100 students in a school, a researcher performed a cluster analysis to group the students based on their heights. The researcher found 3 distinct clusters based on the following height ranges: Cluster 1 (below 160 cm), Cluster 2 (between 160 cm and 170 cm), and Cluster 3 (above 170 cm). What percentage of students belong to Cluster 2?",
    "message_2": "To determine the percentage of students belonging to Cluster 2, we need to know the number of students in each cluster. Unfortunately, the information provided does not give us the exact number of students in each cluster. \n\nIf you can provide the number of students in each cluster, we can calculate the percentage of students belonging to Cluster 2."
