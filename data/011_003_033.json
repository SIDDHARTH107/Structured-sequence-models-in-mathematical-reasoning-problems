    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to form a committee of 4 people from a group of 10 people, we can use the combination formula or Pascal's Triangle. In this case, we are asked to use Pascal's Triangle.\n\nPascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The outer edges of the triangle are always 1. The rows of Pascal's Triangle represent the coefficients in the binomial expansion of (a+b)^n, and they also represent the combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nHere's the beginning of Pascal's Triangle:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n```\n\nWe want to find the number of ways to choose 4 people from a group of 10, which is represented by the combination 10C4 (read as \"10 choose 4\"). In Pascal's Triangle, this value is located in the 11th row (since we start counting from row 0) and the 5th element (since we start counting from element 0).\n\nSo, we need to expand Pascal's Triangle until we reach the 11th row:\n\n```\n        1\n       1 1\n      1 2 1\n     1 3 3 1\n    1 4 6 4 1\n   1 5 10 10 5 1\n  1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1\n```\n\nNow, we can find the 11th row:\n\n```\n1 9 36 84 126 126 84 36 9 1\n```\n\nThe 5th element in this row is 126. Therefore, there are 126 ways to form a committee of 4 people from a group of 10 people using Pascal's Triangle."
