    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 0, 1) in the direction of the vector (1, 1, 0), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface S by the map X(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2). Then, the partial derivatives of X with respect to u and v are:\n\nX_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nX_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form (the metric tensor) by taking the dot product of these partial derivatives:\n\nI = (X_u • X_u, X_u • X_v)\n    (X_v • X_u, X_v • X_v)\n\nI = (1 + 4u^2, 4uv)\n    (4uv, 1 + 4v^2)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives of X:\n\nX_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nX_uv = (0, 0, 2)\nX_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form (the shape operator) by taking the dot product of these second partial derivatives with the normal vector N to the surface:\n\nN = X_u × X_v = (2u, 2v, -1)\n\nWe normalize N:\n\n|N| = sqrt((2u)^2 + (2v)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nN_normalized = (2u/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), 2v/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), -1/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form:\n\nII = (X_uu • N_normalized, X_uv • N_normalized)\n     (X_vu • N_normalized, X_vv • N_normalized)\n\nII = (2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), 2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n     (2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), 2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n\nNow, we compute the sectional curvature K at the point (1, 0, 1) in the direction of the vector (1, 1, 0). To do this, we first need to find the tangent vector at this point in the direction of (1, 1, 0):\n\nT = X_u + X_v = (1, 0, 2) + (0, 1, 0) = (1, 1, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the sectional curvature K using the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nK = (II(T, T))/(I(T, T)) = (II(1, 1, 2))/(I(1, 1, 2))\n\nAt the point (1, 0, 1):\n\nI = (1 + 4(1)^2, 4(1)(0))\n    (4(1)(0), 1 + 4(0)^2)\n\nI = (5, 0)\n    (0, 1)\n\nII = (2/sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(0)^2 + 1), 2/sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(0)^2 + 1))\n     (2/sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(0)^2 + 1), 2/sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(0)^2 + 1))\n\nII = (2/sqrt(5), 2/sqrt(5))\n     (2/sqrt(5), 2/sqrt(5))\n\nNow, we compute I(T, T) and II(T, T):\n\nI(T, T) = 5(1)² + 2(1)(1) + 1(2)² = 5 + 2 + 4 = 11\n\nII(T, T) = 2/sqrt(5)(1)² + 2(1)(1) + 2/sqrt(5)(2)² = 2/sqrt(5) + 2 + 8/sqrt(5) = 10/sqrt(5)\n\nFinally, we compute the sectional curvature K:\n\nK = (II(T, T))/(I(T, T)) = (10/sqrt(5))/11 = 10/(11*sqrt(5))\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 0, 1) in the direction of the vector (1, 1, 0) is K = 10/(11*sqrt(5))."
