    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ for the complex projective variety given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$, we first need to find the cohomology groups of the variety.\n\nThe variety is a smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$. The cohomology groups of a smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ are well-known. They are given by:\n\n$H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\mathbb{C}$, $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$, $H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\mathbb{C}$, $H^3(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$, $H^4(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ using the Hodge decomposition theorem. The Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a smooth projective variety $X$ over $\\mathbb{C}$, we have:\n\n$H^k(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(X)$.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n$h^{0,0} = \\dim_\\mathbb{C} H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 1$,\n$h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = \\dim_\\mathbb{C} H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$,\n$h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = \\dim_\\mathbb{C} H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 1$,\n$h^{3,0} = h^{0,3} = \\dim_\\mathbb{C} H^3(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$,\n$h^{4,0} = h^{0,4} = \\dim_\\mathbb{C} H^4(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 1$.\n\nFor the remaining Hodge numbers, we can use the fact that $h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}$, which follows from the conjugate symmetry of the Hodge decomposition. Therefore, we have:\n\n$h^{1,1} = h^{1,1} = 1$,\n$h^{2,1} = h^{1,2} = 0$,\n$h^{3,1} = h^{1,3} = 0$,\n$h^{4,1} = h^{1,4} = 0$.\n\nSo, the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ for the complex projective variety given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ are:\n\n$h^{0,0} = 1$,\n$h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 0$,\n$h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = 1$,\n$h^{3,0} = h^{0,3} = 0$,\n$h^{4,0} = h^{0,4} = 1$,\n$h^{1,1} = 1$,\n$h^{2,1} = h^{1,2} = 0$,\n$h^{3,1} = h^{1,3} = 0$,\n$h^{4,1} = h^{1,4} = 0$."
