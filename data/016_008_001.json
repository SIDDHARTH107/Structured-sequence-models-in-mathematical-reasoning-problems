    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is independent of the initial segment length. The Hausdorff dimension (D) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, it is composed of 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 1/3 (s = 1/3). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.26186\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.26186, regardless of the initial segment length."
