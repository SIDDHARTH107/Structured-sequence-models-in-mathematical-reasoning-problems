    "message_2": "Let's find the smallest positive multiple of 12 that ends with the digit 8.\n\nWe know that a multiple of 12 must be divisible by both 3 and 4. Since the number ends with 8, it must be even, and thus divisible by 2. Now we just need to find a number that satisfies the divisibility rule for 3 and 4.\n\nThe divisibility rule for 3 states that the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3. The divisibility rule for 4 states that the last two digits of the number must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet's start with the smallest two-digit number that ends with 8, which is 18. The sum of the digits is 1 + 8 = 9, which is divisible by 3. However, 18 is not divisible by 4, so we need to keep looking.\n\nLet's try the next smallest number that ends with 8, which is 28. The sum of the digits is 2 + 8 = 10, which is not divisible by 3, so this number doesn't work either.\n\nNow let's try 38. The sum of the digits is 3 + 8 = 11, which is not divisible by 3, so this number doesn't work.\n\nNext, we have 48. The sum of the digits is 4 + 8 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Additionally, the last two digits, 48, are divisible by 4. Therefore, 48 is the smallest positive multiple of 12 that ends with the digit 8."
