    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedrons. In each iteration, the number of smaller tetrahedrons increases by a factor of 4. \n\nTo find the number of smaller tetrahedrons in the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of smaller tetrahedrons = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of smaller tetrahedrons = 4^5 = 1024\n\nSo, there are 1024 smaller tetrahedrons in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski tetrahedron construction."
