The balloon is initially spherical and has a radius of 5 centimeters. How quickly is the radius of the balloon increasing when the radius is 8 centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the formula for the volume of a sphere and differentiate it with respect to time.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = 10 cm³/s (the rate at which the balloon is being inflated). We want to find dr/dt (the rate at which the radius is increasing) when the radius is 8 cm.\n\nFirst, we'll differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:\n\ndV/dt = d/dt[(4/3)πr^3]\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π(3r^2)(dr/dt)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ndV/dt = 4πr^2(dr/dt)\n\nWe are given dV/dt = 10 cm³/s and we want to find dr/dt when r = 8 cm. Plug in these values into the equation:\n\n10 = 4π(8^2)(dr/dt)\n\nNow, solve for dr/dt:\n\n10 = 256π(dr/dt)\n\ndr/dt = 10/(256π)\n\ndr/dt ≈ 0.0123 cm/s\n\nSo, when the radius of the balloon is 8 cm, the radius is increasing at a rate of approximately 0.0123 cm/s."
