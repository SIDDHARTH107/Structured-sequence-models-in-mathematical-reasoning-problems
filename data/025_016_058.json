Suppose that $X$ has dimension $n$ and that there is a point $p \\in X$ such that $f$ is not defined at $p$. Let $Z$ be the closure of $f(X \\backslash \\{p\\})$ in $Y$. Prove that $Z$ has dimension at least $n-1$. \n\nFind the minimum possible dimension of $Z$ if $n=3$.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $Z$ has dimension at least $n-1$, we will use the fact that $X$ and $Y$ are birational. This means that there exists a rational map $g: Y \\dashrightarrow X$ such that $g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g$ are the identity maps on the open subsets where they are defined.\n\nNow, let $U \\subseteq X$ and $V \\subseteq Y$ be open subsets such that $f$ is defined on $U$ and $g$ is defined on $V$. Since $f$ is not defined at $p$, we have $p \\notin U$. Let $W = f(U) \\subseteq V$. Then, $W$ is an open subset of $Y$ and $g$ is defined on $W$. Moreover, $g(W) \\subseteq U$.\n\nSince $f$ and $g$ are inverses on the open subsets where they are defined, we have $g(W) = U \\backslash \\{p\\}$. Thus, the restriction of $g$ to $W$ is a surjective map from $W$ to $U \\backslash \\{p\\}$. This implies that $\\dim(W) = \\dim(U \\backslash \\{p\\})$. Since $U$ is an open subset of $X$, we have $\\dim(U) = n$. Therefore, $\\dim(U \\backslash \\{p\\}) \\geq n-1$.\n\nNow, let $Z$ be the closure of $f(X \\backslash \\{p\\})$ in $Y$. Since $W \\subseteq Z$, we have $\\dim(W) \\leq \\dim(Z)$. Combining this with the inequality $\\dim(U \\backslash \\{p\\}) \\geq n-1$, we get $\\dim(Z) \\geq n-1$.\n\nFor the case when $n=3$, we want to find the minimum possible dimension of $Z$. Since we have shown that $\\dim(Z) \\geq n-1 = 2$, the minimum possible dimension of $Z$ is 2."
