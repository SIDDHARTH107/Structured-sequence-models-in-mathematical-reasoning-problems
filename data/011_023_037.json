    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of distinct colors required to color the vertices of graph G, we need to find the chromatic number of the graph. The chromatic number is the smallest number of colors needed to color a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph. The maximum degree is the largest number of edges incident to a single vertex. Since there are 9 vertices and 20 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 20) / 9 ≈ 4.44. Therefore, the maximum degree must be at least 5 (as the average degree is greater than 4).\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario, which is when the graph is a complete graph (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the maximum degree would be 8 (since each vertex would be connected to the other 8 vertices). However, we know that there are only 20 edges, which is less than the 36 edges required for a complete graph with 9 vertices. So, the maximum degree must be less than 8.\n\nSince the maximum degree is at least 5 and less than 8, let's consider the case when the maximum degree is 5. According to the greedy coloring algorithm, we can color a graph with maximum degree Δ using Δ + 1 colors. In this case, we would need 5 + 1 = 6 colors.\n\nHowever, we can try to find a better coloring using fewer colors. Let's try to color the graph using 5 colors. If we can find a valid coloring with 5 colors, then the chromatic number is 5. If not, the chromatic number is 6.\n\nTo check if a 5-coloring is possible, we can use the fact that a graph is 5-colorable if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is isomorphic to the complete graph K_6 (i.e., a graph with 6 vertices, each connected to every other vertex). Since our graph has only 20 edges, it is not possible to have a K_6 subgraph, as K_6 requires 6 * (6 - 1) / 2 = 15 edges, and the remaining 3 vertices would need at least 3 more edges to connect to the K_6 subgraph, totaling 18 edges. This would leave only 2 edges for the rest of the graph, which is not enough to create a connected graph with 9 vertices.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the graph G is 5-colorable, and the minimum number of distinct colors required to color the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 5."
