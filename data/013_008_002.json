    "message_1": "Suppose there are 5 individuals in a community and they must decide how much money to contribute to a public good. Each individual can contribute anywhere from $1 to $10. The benefit of the public good is twice the sum of the contributions. If all individuals contribute the same amount, how much should each individual contribute to maximize their own benefit?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the contribution of each individual as x. Since there are 5 individuals and they all contribute the same amount, the total contribution will be 5x. The benefit of the public good is twice the sum of the contributions, so the benefit will be 2(5x) = 10x.\n\nTo maximize their own benefit, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the benefit function 10x. Since the function is linear and increasing, the maximum benefit will be achieved when each individual contributes the maximum amount, which is $10.\n\nSo, each individual should contribute $10 to maximize their own benefit."
