    "message_1": "Please find below a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose we have two types called \"Nat\" and \"Bool\". Nat stands for Natural numbers (e.g., 0,1,2,3,...) and Bool stands for Boolean values (i.e., true or false). We define a function \"is_even\" that takes a Natural number as input and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the number is even or not. Moreover, we define another function \"add\" that takes two Natural numbers as inputs and returns their sum.\n\nUsing the above definitions, write down the type of each of the following expressions:\n\n1. is_even(add(2, 3))\n\n2. add(is_even(4), 5)\n\n3. is_even(add(3, 4))\n\n4. add(is_even(7), is_even(6))\n\nSolve the above expressions and give the resulting type for each one of them.",
    "message_2": "1. is_even(add(2, 3))\n\nType: Bool\nExplanation: The \"add\" function takes two natural numbers (2 and 3) and returns their sum (5). Then, the \"is_even\" function takes the natural number (5) and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is even or not (false).\n\n2. add(is_even(4), 5)\n\nType: Error\nExplanation: The \"is_even\" function takes a natural number (4) and returns a boolean value (true). However, the \"add\" function expects two natural numbers as inputs, but it receives a boolean value (true) and a natural number (5). This is a type mismatch, and the expression is invalid.\n\n3. is_even(add(3, 4))\n\nType: Bool\nExplanation: The \"add\" function takes two natural numbers (3 and 4) and returns their sum (7). Then, the \"is_even\" function takes the natural number (7) and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is even or not (false).\n\n4. add(is_even(7), is_even(6))\n\nType: Error\nExplanation: The \"is_even\" function takes natural numbers (7 and 6) and returns boolean values (false and true, respectively). However, the \"add\" function expects two natural numbers as inputs, but it receives two boolean values (false and true). This is a type mismatch, and the expression is invalid."
