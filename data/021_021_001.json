    "message_1": "A company produces two types of wines, A and B. The production of wine A requires 4 hours of processing, while wine B requires 7 hours. The company has 300 processing hours available per week. Wine A is sold for $10 per bottle and wine B is sold for $15 per bottle. The company wants to maximize its profits. How many bottles of each type of wine should the company produce per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of bottles of wine A produced per week and y be the number of bottles of wine B produced per week. We have the following constraints:\n\n4x + 7y ≤ 300 (processing hours constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for wine A)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for wine B)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then find the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. Graph the constraints:\n\n4x + 7y ≤ 300\ny ≤ (300 - 4x) / 7\n\n2. Find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. The vertices are:\n\nA: (0, 0) - intersection of y-axis and the line y = (300 - 4x) / 7\nB: (75, 0) - intersection of x-axis and the line y = (300 - 4x) / 7\nC: (0, 42.857) - intersection of y-axis and the line y = (300 - 4x) / 7\n\n3. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(B) = 10(75) + 15(0) = $750\nP(C) = 10(0) + 15(42.857) = $642.855\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at vertex B, where the company produces 75 bottles of wine A and 0 bottles of wine B per week. The maximum profit is $750 per week."
