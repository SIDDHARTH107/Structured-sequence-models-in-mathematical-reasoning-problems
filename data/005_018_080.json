    "message_2": "To calculate the median and the 75th percentile of the survival times using the survival function, we first need to order the data and then find the survival function for each time point.\n\nThe data is already ordered:\n\n12, 15, 15, 18, 18, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 36, 42, 45, 48, 60, 72, 84, 90, 96, 120\n\nNext, we calculate the survival function for each time point. The survival function, S(t), is the probability that a patient survives beyond time t. In this case, we can calculate it as the number of patients who survived beyond time t divided by the total number of patients (20).\n\nS(12) = 19/20\nS(15) = 17/20\nS(18) = 14/20\nS(21) = 13/20\nS(24) = 12/20\nS(27) = 11/20\nS(30) = 10/20\nS(36) = 9/20\nS(42) = 8/20\nS(45) = 7/20\nS(48) = 6/20\nS(60) = 5/20\nS(72) = 4/20\nS(84) = 3/20\nS(90) = 2/20\nS(96) = 1/20\nS(120) = 0/20\n\nNow, we can find the median and the 75th percentile.\n\n1. Median: The median is the time point at which the survival function is equal to 0.5 (50% of patients have survived beyond this time). Looking at the survival function values, the median lies between 30 and 36 months. Since we don't have an exact value for 0.5, we can take the average of 30 and 36 to get the median:\n\nMedian = (30 + 36) / 2 = 33 months\n\n2. 75th Percentile: The 75th percentile is the time point at which the survival function is equal to 0.25 (75% of patients have survived beyond this time). Looking at the survival function values, the 75th percentile lies between 48 and 60 months. Since we don't have an exact value for 0.25, we can take the average of 48 and 60 to get the 75th percentile:\n\n75th Percentile = (48 + 60) / 2 = 54 months\n\nSo, the median survival time is 33 months, and the 75th percentile survival time is 54 months."
