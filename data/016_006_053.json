    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern fractal is generated using an iterated function system (IFS) consisting of four affine transformations. Each transformation has a probability associated with it, and the scaling factors are part of the transformation matrices. The four transformations are as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (with probability 0.01):\n   | 0.00  0.00 |   | x |   | 0 |\n   | 0.16  0.00 | * | y | + | 0 |\n\n   Scaling factors: a = 0.00, d = 0.16\n\n2. Transformation 2 (with probability 0.85):\n   |  0.85  0.04 |   | x |   | 0 |\n   | -0.04  0.85 | * | y | + | 1.60 |\n\n   Scaling factors: a = 0.85, d = 0.85\n\n3. Transformation 3 (with probability 0.07):\n   |  0.20 -0.26 |   | x |   | 0 |\n   |  0.23  0.22 | * | y | + | 1.60 |\n\n   Scaling factors: a = 0.20, d = 0.22\n\n4. Transformation 4 (with probability 0.07):\n   | -0.15  0.28 |   | x |   | 0 |\n   |  0.26  0.24 | * | y | + | 0.44 |\n\n   Scaling factors: a = -0.15, d = 0.24\n\nThese scaling factors are used in the affine transformations to generate the Barnsley fern fractal."
