    "message_1": "Consider a sealed bid auction for a painting. There are three bidders, each with a private valuation of the painting. Bidder 1 values the painting at $500, bidder 2 values the painting at $700 and bidder 3 values the painting at $900. What is the expected revenue of the auction if each bidder submits their true value?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed bid auction, each bidder submits their bid without knowing the bids of the other participants. If each bidder submits their true value, the bids will be as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $500\nBidder 2: $700\nBidder 3: $900\n\nThe painting will be sold to the highest bidder, which in this case is bidder 3 with a bid of $900. Therefore, the expected revenue of the auction is $900."
