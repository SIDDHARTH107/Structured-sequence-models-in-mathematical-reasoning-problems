    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\n$$u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this into the given PDE:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2u(x,y)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2u(x,y)}{\\partial y^2} = X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$$\n\nNext, we divide by $u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends on x and y separately, it must be equal to a constant. We set:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda, \\quad \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n2) $Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$\n\nWe solve these ODEs subject to the given boundary conditions.\n\nFor the first ODE, we have:\n\n$$u(0,y) = X(0)Y(y) = \\sin(\\pi y)$$\n$$u(1,y) = X(1)Y(y) = 0$$\n\nThis implies that $X(0) = 1$ and $X(1) = 0$. The general solution of the first ODE is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 1$$\n$$X(1) = \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 0$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\n$$B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = -\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda})$$\n\nSince $B \\neq 0$, we have:\n\n$$\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = -\\frac{1}{B}\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda})$$\n\nSquaring both sides and using the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1$, we get:\n\n$$\\lambda = (n\\pi)^2, \\quad n = 1,2,3,...$$\n\nNow, we solve the second ODE:\n\n$$Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C_n\\cosh(n\\pi y) + D_n\\sinh(n\\pi y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$$u(x,0) = X(x)Y(0) = 1$$\n$$u(x,1) = X(x)Y(1) = 0$$\n\nThis implies that $Y(0) = 1$ and $Y(1) = 0$. From the first condition, we have:\n\n$$C_n = 1$$\n\nFrom the second condition, we have:\n\n$$\\sinh(n\\pi) = 0$$\n\nHowever, this is not possible since $\\sinh(x) \\neq 0$ for $x \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have $D_n = 0$. Thus, the solution for $Y(y)$ is:\n\n$$Y(y) = \\cosh(n\\pi y)$$\n\nNow, we can write the solution for $u(x,y)$ as a sum of the product of $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$:\n\n$$u(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x)Y_n(y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[A_n\\cos(n\\pi x) + B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\right]\\cosh(n\\pi y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(x,0) = 1$, we get:\n\n$$1 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\cos(n\\pi x)$$\n\nUsing the orthogonality of cosine functions, we can find $A_n$:\n\n$$A_n = \\int_0^1 \\cos(n\\pi x) dx = \\frac{2}{n\\pi} \\quad \\text{for odd n}$$\n$$A_n = 0 \\quad \\text{for even n}$$\n\nFinally, the solution for $u(x,y)$ is:\n\n$$u(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n\\pi}\\cos(n\\pi x)\\cosh(n\\pi y)$$"
