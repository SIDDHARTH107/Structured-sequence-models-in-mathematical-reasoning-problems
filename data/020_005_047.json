    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of widgets, type A and type B. A type A widget requires 2 units of raw material and 3 hours of labor to produce, while a type B widget requires 3 units of raw material and 2 hours of labor to produce. The company has 120 units of raw material and 90 hours of labor available for production. The profit for each type A widget produced is $5, and for each type B widget produced is $4. What is the maximum profit the company can earn if they can only produce a total of 30 widgets?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A widgets produced and y be the number of type B widgets produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 30 (total number of widgets)\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 120 (raw material constraint)\n3. 3x + 2y ≤ 90 (labor constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 30\n   y ≤ 30 - x\n\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 120\n   y ≤ (120 - 2x) / 3\n\n3. 3x + 2y ≤ 90\n   y ≤ (90 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 10), (30, 0), and (18, 12). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 30) = 5(0) + 4(30) = $120\n3. P(20, 10) = 5(20) + 4(10) = $140\n4. P(30, 0) = 5(30) + 4(0) = $150\n5. P(18, 12) = 5(18) + 4(12) = $132\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 30 type A widgets and 0 type B widgets, resulting in a profit of $150."
