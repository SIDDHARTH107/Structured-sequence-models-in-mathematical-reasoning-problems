    "message_2": "First, we need to compute the exterior derivative of $f(x,y,z)$. We have:\n\n$$df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} dz = (3x^2y^2z) dx + (2x^3yz) dy + (x^3y^2) dz$$\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivative of the given 2-form $\\omega$:\n\n$$\\omega = df \\wedge dy + dx \\wedge dz$$\n\nTo compute the exterior derivative of $\\omega$, we apply the linearity and the product rule for the exterior derivative:\n\n$$d\\omega = d(df \\wedge dy) + d(dx \\wedge dz)$$\n\nNow, we apply the product rule for the exterior derivative:\n\n$$d\\omega = (ddf) \\wedge dy + df \\wedge d(dy) + (ddx) \\wedge dz + dx \\wedge d(dz)$$\n\nSince the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form, the exterior derivative of a 2-form is a 3-form, and the exterior derivative of a 3-form is a 4-form, we have $ddx = ddy = ddz = 0$. Also, $ddf = 0$ because the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form and the exterior derivative of a 2-form is a 3-form. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$d\\omega = df \\wedge d(dy) + dx \\wedge d(dz)$$\n\nNow, we compute the exterior derivatives of $dy$ and $dz$:\n\n$$d(dy) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d(dz) = 0$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$d\\omega = df \\wedge 0 + dx \\wedge 0 = 0$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the 2-form $\\omega$ on the manifold $M$ is $0$."
