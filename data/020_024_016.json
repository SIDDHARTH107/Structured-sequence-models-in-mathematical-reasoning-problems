    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a product at a cost of $100 per unit. The demand function for this product is p = 500 - 2q, where p is the price and q is the quantity demanded. What price should the company charge to maximize its revenue?",
    "message_2": "To maximize revenue, we need to find the price at which the product of price (p) and quantity demanded (q) is maximized. This can be represented as R = pq, where R is the revenue.\n\nWe are given the demand function p = 500 - 2q. We can substitute this into the revenue function:\n\nR = (500 - 2q)q\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of R. To do this, we can take the derivative of R with respect to q and set it equal to 0:\n\ndR/dq = 500 - 4q\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for q:\n\n0 = 500 - 4q\n4q = 500\nq = 125\n\nNow that we have the quantity demanded that maximizes revenue, we can plug this value back into the demand function to find the price:\n\np = 500 - 2(125)\np = 500 - 250\np = 250\n\nSo, the company should charge $250 per unit to maximize its revenue."
