    "message_2": "1. $\\forall x \\exists y: y > x$\n\nThis sentence is true in $\\mathbb{N}$. For every natural number $x$, there exists a natural number $y$ such that $y > x$. We can simply choose $y = x + 1$. Since $x + 1 \\neq 0$ (by the last axiom), we have $y \\neq x$. Moreover, $y = x + 1 > x$.\n\n2. $\\exists x \\forall y: y \\cdot x = y$\n\nThis sentence is false in $\\mathbb{N}$. There is no natural number $x$ such that for all natural numbers $y$, $y \\cdot x = y$. To see this, consider the case when $y = 1$. If $y \\cdot x = y$, then $1 \\cdot x = 1$. But we know that $1 \\cdot x = x$ (by the fifth axiom), so we would have $x = 1$. However, this does not hold for all $y$. For example, when $y = 2$, we have $2 \\cdot x = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\neq 1$."
