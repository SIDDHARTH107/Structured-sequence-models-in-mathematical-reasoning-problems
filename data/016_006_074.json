    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern fractal is generated using an iterated function system (IFS) with four affine transformations. Each transformation has a different probability of being applied and scales the current point by a specific factor. The scaling factors for the four transformations are:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (probability 0.01): Scaling factor 0\n2. Transformation 2 (probability 0.85): Scaling factor 0.85\n3. Transformation 3 (probability 0.07): Scaling factor 0.2\n4. Transformation 4 (probability 0.07): Scaling factor 0.2\n\nTo find the average scaling factor after four iterations, we can calculate the weighted average of the scaling factors raised to the power of 4 (since we are considering four iterations):\n\nWeighted average scaling factor = (0.01 * 0^4) + (0.85 * 0.85^4) + (0.07 * 0.2^4) + (0.07 * 0.2^4)\n\nWeighted average scaling factor ≈ 0.01 * 0 + 0.85 * 0.52200625 + 0.07 * 0.0016 + 0.07 * 0.0016\nWeighted average scaling factor ≈ 0.4437053125\n\nSo, the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern fractal after four iterations, with an initial line segment length of 5 units, is approximately 0.4437."
