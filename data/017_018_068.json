    "message_2": "To find all the distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we can use the fact that 32 = 2^5. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, the abelian groups of order 32 can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups with orders that are powers of 2. The possible partitions of 5 (the exponent of 2) are:\n\n1. 5\n2. 4 + 1\n3. 3 + 2\n4. 3 + 1 + 1\n5. 2 + 2 + 1\n6. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n7. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThese partitions correspond to the following abelian groups:\n\n1. C_32 (cyclic group of order 32)\n2. C_16 × C_2\n3. C_8 × C_4\n4. C_8 × C_2 × C_2\n5. C_4 × C_4 × C_2\n6. C_4 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n7. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n\nThese are all the abelian groups of order 32. Now, we need to find the non-abelian groups of order 32. We can use the Sylow theorems to help us with this task. Since the order of the group is 32 = 2^5, we are looking for 2-Sylow subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is one 2-Sylow subgroup, which means the group is not simple and has a normal 2-Sylow subgroup.\n\nThere are two non-abelian groups of order 32:\n\n1. The dihedral group D_32, which is the group of symmetries of a regular 32-gon. This group has 32 elements, with 16 rotations and 16 reflections. It is non-abelian.\n\n2. The quaternion group Q_32, which is a generalization of the quaternion group Q_8. It is a non-abelian group of order 32 and can be generated by two elements x and y, with the relations x^16 = y^4 = 1, y^2 = x^8, and yxy^(-1) = x^(-1).\n\nIn summary, there are 7 abelian groups and 2 non-abelian groups of order 32:\n\n1. C_32 (cyclic)\n2. C_16 × C_2 (abelian)\n3. C_8 × C_4 (abelian)\n4. C_8 × C_2 × C_2 (abelian)\n5. C_4 × C_4 × C_2 (abelian)\n6. C_4 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 (abelian)\n7. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 (abelian)\n8. D_32 (dihedral)\n9. Q_32 (non-abelian)"
