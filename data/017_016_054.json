    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, we know that |G| = 27 = 3^3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, so n_3 divides 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, only n_3 = 1 and n_3 = 3 satisfy both conditions. \n\nIf n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, which we will call P. Since P is unique, it must be a normal subgroup of G. The order of P is 3^3 = 27, which is the same as the order of G. Therefore, P = G, and G is a cyclic group of order 27, which means G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nIf n_3 = 3, then there are three 3-Sylow subgroups of G. However, there is no known non-abelian group of order 27. In fact, by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every group of order 27 must be isomorphic to one of the following abelian groups: C27, C9 × C3, or C3 × C3 × C3. Since none of these groups are non-abelian, G cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, as there is no non-abelian group of order 27."
