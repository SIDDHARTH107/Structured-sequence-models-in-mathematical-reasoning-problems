    "message_2": "G can be isomorphic to both C6 and D3, depending on the properties of the group.\n\nC6 is the cyclic group of order 6, generated by a single element, say a, with the property that a^6 = e (the identity element), and all the powers of a are distinct. The elements of C6 are {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}. C6 is abelian, meaning that the group operation is commutative (i.e., a*b = b*a for all elements a and b in the group).\n\nD3, also known as the dihedral group of order 6, is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. It consists of three rotations (including the identity rotation) and three reflections. The elements of D3 can be represented as {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}, where r is a rotation by 120 degrees, s is a reflection, and e is the identity element. D3 is non-abelian, meaning that the group operation is not commutative (i.e., there exist elements a and b in the group such that a*b â‰  b*a).\n\nIf G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to C6. If G is non-abelian, then it must be isomorphic to D3. So, G can be isomorphic to either C6 or D3, depending on its properties."
