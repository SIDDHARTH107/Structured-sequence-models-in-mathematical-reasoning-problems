    "message_1": "In a factory that produces electrical appliances, the probability of an electric shock occurring on any given day is 0.06. If the factory operates for 300 days in a year, what is the probability of an electric shock occurring at least once during the year in the workplace?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of an electric shock occurring at least once during the year, we can first find the probability of no electric shocks occurring throughout the year and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no electric shock occurring on a given day is 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.\n\nFor no electric shocks to occur in 300 days, the probability is 0.94^300.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one electric shock occurring during the year:\n\nP(at least one electric shock) = 1 - P(no electric shocks)\nP(at least one electric shock) = 1 - 0.94^300\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(at least one electric shock) ≈ 1 - 0.000006 ≈ 0.999994\n\nSo, the probability of an electric shock occurring at least once during the year in the workplace is approximately 0.999994 or 99.9994%."
