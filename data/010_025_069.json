If we glue two such surfaces along their boundaries to form a surface of genus 3, what number is assigned to the resulting surface by the quantum field theory?",
    "message_2": "In a two-dimensional topological quantum field theory (TQFT), the value assigned to a closed oriented surface depends on its topology. In this case, the TQFT assigns the number 5 to a closed oriented surface of genus 2.\n\nWhen we glue two surfaces of genus 2 along their boundaries, we form a surface of genus 3. To determine the number assigned to this new surface by the TQFT, we can use the property of TQFTs that the value assigned to the disjoint union of two surfaces is the product of the values assigned to each surface individually.\n\nSince the TQFT assigns the number 5 to each of the two genus 2 surfaces, the number assigned to the resulting genus 3 surface is:\n\n5 * 5 = 25\n\nSo, the TQFT assigns the number 25 to the closed oriented surface of genus 3 formed by gluing two genus 2 surfaces along their boundaries."
