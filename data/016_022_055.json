    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron or Tetrix, is a fractal structure that is formed by repeatedly removing smaller equilateral triangles from a larger equilateral triangle. The height of the pyramid refers to the number of iterations or levels in the construction process.\n\nFor a Sierpinski pyramid of height 4, we can calculate the number of equilateral triangles needed at each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 triangle (base triangle)\nLevel 2: 4 triangles (1 base triangle + 3 smaller triangles)\nLevel 3: 16 triangles (4 triangles from Level 2 × 4)\nLevel 4: 64 triangles (16 triangles from Level 3 × 4)\n\nSo, a Sierpinski pyramid of height 4 requires a total of 64 equilateral triangles."
