    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, meaning it fills the entire unit square. For each increase in order, the curve becomes more intricate and covers more of the square. The length of the Peano curve increases with each order, and it can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nLength = (side length of the square) * (3^(order))\n\nFor a Peano curve of order 2 within a square of side length 1 unit, the length can be calculated as follows:\n\nLength = 1 * (3^2) = 1 * 9 = 9 units\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve of order 2 within a square of side length 1 unit is 9 units."
