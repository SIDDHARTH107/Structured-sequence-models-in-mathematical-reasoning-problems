    "message_2": "In Computability Theory, there isn't a specific smallest positive integer that cannot be computed by any algorithm. However, there are uncountably many non-computable numbers, which means that there are numbers that cannot be computed by any algorithm.\n\nOne example of a non-computable number is the halting probability of a universal Turing machine, also known as Chaitin's constant. This constant is a real number between 0 and 1, and it represents the probability that a randomly chosen Turing machine will halt when given a random input. Chaitin's constant is uncomputable because it cannot be determined by any algorithm.\n\nHowever, this constant is not an integer, and there isn't a specific smallest positive integer that cannot be computed by any algorithm. The concept of non-computability is more relevant to real numbers and functions rather than integers."
