    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = z^3 / (z-1)^2 for the annulus 1 < |z| < 2, we first rewrite the function in terms of a new variable w = 1/z. This will allow us to find the expansion in powers of w, which will correspond to negative powers of z.\n\nLet w = 1/z, then z = 1/w. Now we can rewrite f(z) in terms of w:\n\nf(z) = f(1/w) = (1/w)^3 / ((1/w) - 1)^2 = w^3 / (1 - w)^2\n\nNow we can find the Taylor series expansion of g(w) = w^3 / (1 - w)^2:\n\ng(w) = w^3 * (1 - w)^(-2)\n\nUsing the binomial series expansion formula for (1 - w)^(-2):\n\n(1 - w)^(-2) = sum_{n=0}^∞ C(-2, n) * (-w)^n = sum_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) * w^n\n\nNow we can multiply this series by w^3:\n\ng(w) = w^3 * sum_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) * w^n = sum_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) * w^{n+3}\n\nNow we can rewrite g(w) back in terms of z:\n\nf(z) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) * (1/z)^{n+3} = sum_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) * z^{-(n+3)}\n\nSo the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = z^3 / (z-1)^2 for the annulus 1 < |z| < 2 is:\n\nf(z) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) * z^{-(n+3)}"
