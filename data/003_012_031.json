    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The base of the ladder is 3 meters from the wall and the ladder's length is 5 meters. What is the angle of elevation of the ladder from the ground to the nearest degree?",
    "message_2": "We can use the right triangle trigonometric ratios to solve this problem. In this case, we have a right triangle formed by the ladder, the ground, and the wall. The ladder's length is the hypotenuse (5 meters), and the base of the ladder is one of the legs (3 meters). Let's call the angle of elevation θ.\n\nWe can use the cosine function to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(θ) = 3 / 5\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse cosine (also called arccos) to find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(3/5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation of the ladder from the ground is approximately 53 degrees."
