    "message_2": "To show that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B, we first need to find the intersection of set A and set B.\n\nThe intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that this intersection is a subset of both set A and set B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if all elements of set X are also elements of set Y, then set X is a subset of set Y.\n\nLet's check if the intersection A ∩ B is a subset of set A:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nBoth elements 2 and 4 are members of set A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of set A.\n\nNow, let's check if the intersection A ∩ B is a subset of set B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nBoth elements 2 and 4 are members of set B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of set B.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection of set A and set B, which is {2, 4}, is a subset of set A and a subset of set B."
