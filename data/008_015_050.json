    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 3  5 -1 |\n    | 5 13 -3 |\n    | 0  3  9 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 19 |\n    |  2 |\n\nNow, we will perform the Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. The Cholesky decomposition is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. In this case, A is a real symmetric positive-definite matrix, so we can decompose it into:\n\nA = L * L^T\n\nwhere L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is the transpose of L.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can see that matrix A is not positive-definite. The determinant of the top-left 2x2 submatrix is negative:\n\ndet | 3  5 |\n    | 5 13 | = 3*13 - 5*5 = 39 - 25 = 14\n\nThe determinant of the entire matrix A is also negative:\n\ndet(A) = 3*(13*9 - 3*3) - 5*(5*9 - 3*(-3)) + (-1)*(0 - 5*3) = -18\n\nSince matrix A is not positive-definite, we cannot use the Cholesky decomposition to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or the inverse matrix method to solve the system."
