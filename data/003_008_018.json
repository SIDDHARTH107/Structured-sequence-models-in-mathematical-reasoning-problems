    "message_1": "A rectangular field has a length of 50 meters and a width of 30 meters. A triangular garden bed is located in one corner of the field. The two sides of the triangular garden bed that are within the field are 20 meters and 15 meters. What is the area of the triangular garden bed? Round your answer to the nearest square meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangular garden bed, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: (base * height) / 2. In this case, the base and height of the triangle are the two sides within the field, which are 20 meters and 15 meters.\n\nArea = (20 * 15) / 2\nArea = (300) / 2\nArea = 150 square meters\n\nSo, the area of the triangular garden bed is approximately 150 square meters."
