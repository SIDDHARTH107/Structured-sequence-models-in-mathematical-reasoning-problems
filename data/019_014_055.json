    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of x such that f(x) is true, let's analyze the function f(x).\n\nf(x) = ∀y ((y > x) → ∃z (z > y))\n\nThis function states that for all y greater than x, there exists a z such that z is greater than y. In other words, for any number y that is larger than x, there is always a number z that is larger than y.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when x is a negative number. If x is negative, then there will always be a positive number y such that y > x. And since there is no upper bound on positive numbers, we can always find a z > y. Therefore, f(x) is true for any negative value of x.\n\nHowever, we are looking for the minimum value of x for which f(x) is true. Since there is no lower bound on negative numbers, we can say that the minimum value of x for which f(x) is true is x = -∞ (negative infinity)."
