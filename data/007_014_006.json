    "message_2": "The next even perfect number after 28 is 496. \n\nA perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). For even perfect numbers, they can be represented by the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from the work of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.\n\nFor the next even perfect number after 28, we need to find the next pair of prime numbers (p, 2^p - 1) that satisfy the formula. The pair (p, 2^p - 1) = (5, 31) works, since both 5 and 31 are prime numbers.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\n2^(5-1) * (2^5 - 1) = 2^4 * 31 = 16 * 31 = 496\n\nSo, the next even perfect number after 28 is 496."
