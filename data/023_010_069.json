    "message_1": "Consider an image consisting of 512 x 512 pixels where each pixel is represented by an 8-bit grayscale value. Apply a two-dimensional Fourier transform to this image and obtain the Fourier spectrum. If the maximum value in the Fourier spectrum is 2345.67, what is the corresponding spatial frequency?",
    "message_2": "To find the corresponding spatial frequency for the maximum value in the Fourier spectrum, we need to locate the position (u, v) of this maximum value in the Fourier transformed image. However, the information provided is not sufficient to determine the exact position of the maximum value in the Fourier spectrum.\n\nIn general, the spatial frequency can be calculated as follows:\n\nSpatial frequency = sqrt(u^2 + v^2)\n\nWhere u and v are the horizontal and vertical frequencies, respectively.\n\nIf we had the position (u, v) of the maximum value in the Fourier spectrum, we could calculate the corresponding spatial frequency using the formula above. Unfortunately, without this information, it is not possible to determine the spatial frequency."
