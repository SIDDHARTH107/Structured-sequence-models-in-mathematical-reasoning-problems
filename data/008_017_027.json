    "message_2": "The given system of linear equations is:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 6\n2x + 5y + 2z = 4\n3x + 7y + 4z = 5\n\nHowever, the coefficient matrix of this system is not sparse, as all the elements are non-zero. A sparse matrix is a matrix with a significant number of zero elements. In this case, we can use Gaussian elimination or other methods to solve the system of equations.\n\nLet's use Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Subtract the first equation multiplied by 2 from the second equation, and subtract the first equation multiplied by 3 from the third equation:\n\nSecond equation: (2x + 5y + 2z) - 2(x + 2y + 3z) = -2y - 4z = -8\nThird equation: (3x + 7y + 4z) - 3(x + 2y + 3z) = -y - 5z = -13\n\nNow, we have:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 6\n-2y - 4z = -8\n-y - 5z = -13\n\n2. Divide the second equation by -2:\n\ny + 2z = 4\n\n3. Substitute the second equation into the third equation:\n\n(-y - 5z) - (y + 2z) = -13\n-2y - 3z = -13\n\n4. Divide the third equation by -2:\n\ny + (3/2)z = 13/2\n\n5. Subtract the second equation from the fourth equation:\n\n(y + (3/2)z) - (y + 2z) = 13/2 - 4\n-(1/2)z = -1/2\n\n6. Multiply the fifth equation by -2:\n\nz = 1\n\n7. Substitute the value of z back into the second equation:\n\ny + 2(1) = 4\ny = 2\n\n8. Substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation:\n\nx + 2(2) + 3(1) = 6\nx = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 2, and z = 1."
