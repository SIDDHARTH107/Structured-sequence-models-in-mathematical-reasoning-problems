    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we are given the distance traveled (120 miles) and the time interval (2 hours). We can consider the distance function, d(t), where d(t) represents the distance traveled at time t. We are given that d(0) = 0 and d(2) = 120.\n\nThe average rate of change of the distance function over the interval [0, 2] is given by:\n\n(Change in distance) / (Change in time) = (d(2) - d(0)) / (2 - 0) = (120 - 0) / (2 - 0) = 120 / 2 = 60 miles per hour.\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the distance function, d'(c), is equal to the average rate of change of the distance function over the interval [0, 2]. Since d'(t) represents the speed of the car at time t, this means that there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) where the speed of the car is 60 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the car in the given time interval is 60 miles per hour."
