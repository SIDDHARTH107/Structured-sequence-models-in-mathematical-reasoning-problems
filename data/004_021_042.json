    "message_2": "First, we need to find the first derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 2x^2 + 9x - 1. \n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 4x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of the function. Again, using the power rule, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 4\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 48(2) + 4\nf''(2) = 36(4) - 96 + 4\nf''(2) = 144 - 96 + 4\nf''(2) = 52\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 2x^2 + 9x - 1 at x = 2 is 52."
