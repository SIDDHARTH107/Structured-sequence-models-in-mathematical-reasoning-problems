    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (2x^2 - 5x + 1) / (5x^2 + 2x - 1) as x approaches 4, we can simply substitute the value of x into the function and simplify:\n\nf(4) = (2(4)^2 - 5(4) + 1) / (5(4)^2 + 2(4) - 1)\n\nf(4) = (2(16) - 20 + 1) / (5(16) + 8 - 1)\n\nf(4) = (32 - 20 + 1) / (80 + 8 - 1)\n\nf(4) = (13) / (87)\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches 4 is 13/87."
