    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is generated by replacing each line segment with a specific pattern at each iteration. The length of the curve increases by a factor of (√7) with each iteration.\n\nSo, after the 10th iteration, the total length of the Gosper curve will be:\n\nInitial length * (Length increase factor)^(Number of iterations)\n= 1 * (√7)^10\n≈ 1 * 2187\n≈ 2187\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Gosper curve after the 10th iteration is approximately 2187, given that the initial line segment has a length of 1."
