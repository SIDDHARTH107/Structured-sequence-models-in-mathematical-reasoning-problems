    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 108 and 192, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (192) by the smaller number (108) and find the remainder:\n192 รท 108 = 1, remainder 84\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (108) and the smaller number with the remainder (84) from the previous step:\n108 รท 84 = 1, remainder 24\n\n3. Repeat the process:\n84 รท 24 = 3, remainder 12\n\n4. Continue until the remainder is 0:\n24 รท 12 = 2, remainder 0\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the two numbers. In this case, the GCD of 108 and 192 is 12."
