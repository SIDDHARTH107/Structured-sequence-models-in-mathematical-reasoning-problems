    "message_1": "A candy company claims that their bags of candies contain 500 grams of candies on average with a standard deviation of 25 grams. A random sample of 35 bags was taken and their mean weight was found to be 490 grams. Is there enough evidence to support the claim of the company that their bags of candies contain 500 grams of candies on average? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is enough evidence to support the company's claim, we will conduct a hypothesis test using the given information. We will use a one-sample t-test since we are comparing the sample mean to a known population mean and the population standard deviation is given.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 500 grams\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 500 grams\n\nStep 2: Determine the test statistic.\nSince we are using a t-test, the test statistic is calculated as:\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / √sample size)\nt = (490 - 500) / (25 / √35)\nt = -10 / (25 / √35)\nt = -10 / (25 / 5.916)\nt = -10 / 4.226\nt ≈ -2.37\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value.\nWe are using a significance level of 0.05, and since this is a two-tailed test, we will divide the significance level by 2 (0.05/2 = 0.025). With 34 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 35 - 1 = 34), we can find the critical value using a t-distribution table. The critical values are approximately ±2.032.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value.\nOur test statistic t ≈ -2.37 is less than the lower critical value of -2.032.\n\nStep 5: Make a decision.\nSince our test statistic falls in the rejection region (t < -2.032), we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence to suggest that the company's claim that their bags of candies contain 500 grams on average is not supported at the 0.05 significance level."
