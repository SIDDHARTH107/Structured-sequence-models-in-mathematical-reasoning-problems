    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The Fourier series for a function f(x) on the interval [-π, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nWe can now compute the integrals:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [x * (sin(nx)/n) + (cos(nx)/n^2)] [-π, π]\na_n = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(nπ) = 1 or -1)\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-x * (cos(nx)/n) - (sin(nx)/n^2)] [-π, π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [-2π*(-1)^n/n]\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(x) = x is:\n\nf(x) = Σ((-1)^n * 2x / (nπ)) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the series converges pointwise or uniformly. A Fourier series converges pointwise if, for every x in the interval, the limit of the partial sums of the series equals f(x). The Dirichlet's theorem states that if a function is piecewise continuous and has a finite number of discontinuities and extrema in the interval, its Fourier series converges pointwise to the function at every point of continuity and to the average of the left and right limits at points of discontinuity.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = x is continuous on the interval [-π, π], so the Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) on this interval.\n\nTo determine if the series converges uniformly, we can use the uniform convergence theorem for Fourier series, which states that if a function and its first derivative are piecewise continuous on the interval, then the Fourier series converges uniformly to the function on the interval.\n\nFor f(x) = x, the first derivative is f'(x) = 1, which is also continuous on the interval [-π, π]. Therefore, the Fourier series converges uniformly to f(x) on the interval [-π, π].\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series for f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] converges both pointwise and uniformly."
