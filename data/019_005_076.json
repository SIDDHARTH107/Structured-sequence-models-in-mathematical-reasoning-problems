    "message_1": "Suppose that there are two mathematicians, Alice and Bob, and they each have a number between 1 and 100 written on their foreheads. They cannot see their own number but can see the number on the other person's forehead. They are asked to simultaneously guess their own number, but if at least one person guesses incorrectly, they both lose. Can Alice and Bob agree on a strategy beforehand that guarantees they will both guess correctly?",
    "message_2": "No, Alice and Bob cannot agree on a strategy beforehand that guarantees they will both guess their own numbers correctly.\n\nThe reason is that there is no information that Alice can use to deduce her own number based on Bob's number, and vice versa. Any strategy they come up with will still involve some element of chance, as they cannot communicate with each other during the guessing process.\n\nFor example, if Alice sees the number 50 on Bob's forehead, there is no way for her to know whether her own number is 49, 51, or any other number between 1 and 100. Similarly, Bob cannot deduce his own number based on Alice's number.\n\nTherefore, no matter what strategy they agree on beforehand, there will always be a chance that at least one of them will guess incorrectly, and they will both lose."
