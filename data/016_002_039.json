    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by iterating the Koch curve process on each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of sides of the snowflake increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the nth iteration as P(n) and the side length of the original equilateral triangle as L. After the 0th iteration (the original equilateral triangle), the perimeter is P(0) = 3L.\n\nAfter the 1st iteration, the perimeter is P(1) = 3L * (4/3) = 4L.\nAfter the 2nd iteration, the perimeter is P(2) = 4L * (4/3) = 16L/3.\nAfter the 3rd iteration, the perimeter is P(3) = 16L/3 * (4/3) = 64L/9.\nAfter the 4th iteration, the perimeter is P(4) = 64L/9 * (4/3) = 256L/27.\n\nGiven that the side length of the original equilateral triangle is 10 cm, we have L = 10 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the 4th iteration is:\n\nP(4) = 256L/27 = 256(10)/27 â‰ˆ 94.81 cm."
