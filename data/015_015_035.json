    "message_1": "A key feature of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is its oscillatory behaviour. Suppose that the concentration of one of the reactants in a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction oscillates between 0.6 mol/L and 1.2 mol/L with a period of 18 seconds. What is the frequency (in Hz) and amplitude (in mol/L) of this oscillation?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency (in Hz) and amplitude (in mol/L) of the oscillation, we need to analyze the given information.\n\nThe concentration oscillates between 0.6 mol/L and 1.2 mol/L, and the period of oscillation is 18 seconds.\n\n1. Amplitude:\nThe amplitude is half the difference between the maximum and minimum concentration values.\n\nAmplitude = (Maximum concentration - Minimum concentration) / 2\nAmplitude = (1.2 mol/L - 0.6 mol/L) / 2\nAmplitude = 0.6 mol/L / 2\nAmplitude = 0.3 mol/L\n\n2. Frequency:\nFrequency is the reciprocal of the period (time taken for one complete oscillation).\n\nFrequency (in Hz) = 1 / Period (in seconds)\nFrequency = 1 / 18 seconds\nFrequency â‰ˆ 0.056 Hz\n\nSo, the amplitude of the oscillation is 0.3 mol/L, and the frequency is approximately 0.056 Hz."
