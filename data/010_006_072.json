    "message_1": "What is the second homotopy group of the surface of a torus?\n\nTo clarify, the second homotopy group of a topological space measures how loops on the space can be continuously deformed into each other. The answer for this question involves understanding how loops on the surface of a torus behave when they are continuously deformed.",
    "message_2": "The second homotopy group of the surface of a torus, denoted as π₂(T²), is trivial, meaning it only contains the identity element. In other words, π₂(T²) = {e}.\n\nThis is because the torus is a two-dimensional surface, and the second homotopy group measures the behavior of two-dimensional spheres (loops) embedded in the space. In the case of a torus, any two-dimensional sphere embedded in the surface can be continuously deformed into a point, which is the identity element of the homotopy group."
