    "message_2": "A twin prime pair consists of two prime numbers that differ by 2. To find the smallest twin prime pair greater than 50, we can start by checking prime numbers just above 50.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 50 is 53. However, 53 + 2 = 55, which is not a prime number (divisible by 5).\n\nThe next prime number is 59. In this case, 59 + 2 = 61, which is also a prime number.\n\nThus, the smallest twin prime pair greater than 50 is (59, 61)."
