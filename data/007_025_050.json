    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem related to Diffie-Hellman key exchange:\n\nAlice and Bob agree to use a prime number p=23 and a primitive root g=5 for their Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice chooses a secret number a=6 and Bob chooses a secret number b=15. Alice sends Bob A=g^a mod p and Bob sends Alice B=g^b mod p. Using the shared secret key, what is the value of K=(g^ab) mod p?",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute A and B:\n\nA = g^a mod p = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\nB = g^b mod p = 5^15 mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key K using A and B:\n\nAlice computes K = B^a mod p = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\nBob computes K = A^b mod p = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nThe shared secret key K is 2."
