    "message_2": "To find the average daily return and the volatility of the stock using Fourier analysis, we first need to compute the first and second moments of the function f(t). The first moment represents the average daily return, while the square root of the second moment minus the square of the first moment gives the volatility.\n\nLet's compute the first moment (average daily return) E[f(t)]:\n\nE[f(t)] = (1/365) * ∫[f(t) dt] from 0 to 365\n\nE[f(t)] = (1/365) * ∫[10sin(2πt/365) + 15cos(4πt/365) dt] from 0 to 365\n\nIntegrating the function with respect to t:\n\n∫10sin(2πt/365) dt = (-3650/π) * cos(2πt/365)\n∫15cos(4πt/365) dt = (365/8π) * sin(4πt/365)\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral from 0 to 365:\n\nE[f(t)] = (1/365) * [(-3650/π) * (cos(2π*365/365) - cos(2π*0/365)) + (365/8π) * (sin(4π*365/365) - sin(4π*0/365))]\n\nSince cos(2π) = cos(0) = 1 and sin(4π) = sin(0) = 0, we get:\n\nE[f(t)] = (1/365) * [(-3650/π) * (1 - 1) + (365/8π) * (0 - 0)] = 0\n\nThe average daily return is 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the second moment E[f(t)^2]:\n\nE[f(t)^2] = (1/365) * ∫[f(t)^2 dt] from 0 to 365\n\nE[f(t)^2] = (1/365) * ∫[(10sin(2πt/365) + 15cos(4πt/365))^2 dt] from 0 to 365\n\nExpanding the square:\n\nE[f(t)^2] = (1/365) * ∫[100sin^2(2πt/365) + 225cos^2(4πt/365) + 300sin(2πt/365)cos(4πt/365) dt] from 0 to 365\n\nNow, we integrate each term separately:\n\n∫100sin^2(2πt/365) dt = 50t - (2500/π) * sin(4πt/365)\n∫225cos^2(4πt/365) dt = 112.5t + (1125/4π) * sin(8πt/365)\n∫300sin(2πt/365)cos(4πt/365) dt = (3650/π) * cos^2(2πt/365)\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral from 0 to 365:\n\nE[f(t)^2] = (1/365) * [50t - (2500/π) * sin(4πt/365) + 112.5t + (1125/4π) * sin(8πt/365) + (3650/π) * (cos^2(2πt/365) - 1)] from 0 to 365\n\nSince sin(4π) = sin(0) = 0, sin(8π) = sin(0) = 0, and cos^2(2π) = cos^2(0) = 1, we get:\n\nE[f(t)^2] = (1/365) * [(50*365 + 112.5*365) - (2500/π) * (0 - 0) + (1125/4π) * (0 - 0) + (3650/π) * (1 - 1)] = 162.5\n\nNow, we can compute the volatility, which is the square root of the second moment minus the square of the first moment:\n\nVolatility = sqrt(E[f(t)^2] - E[f(t)]^2) = sqrt(162.5 - 0^2) = sqrt(162.5) ≈ 12.75\n\nSo, the volatility of the stock is approximately 12.75."
