    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) with A and B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ A = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1}\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNow, we will find the symmetric difference of the two sets we just found:\n\n({1} ∆ {4}) = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection. We want to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ C) = (A ∩ B) ∆ (A ∩ C)\n\nLet C be an arbitrary set. We will use the properties of symmetric difference and intersection to show the distributive property:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ C) = [(A - B) ∪ (B - A)] ∩ [(A - C) ∪ (C - A)]\n= [(A ∩ B') ∪ (B ∩ A')] ∩ [(A ∩ C') ∪ (C ∩ A')]\n= [(A ∩ B') ∩ (A ∩ C')] ∪ [(A ∩ B') ∩ (C ∩ A')] ∪ [(B ∩ A') ∩ (A ∩ C')] ∪ [(B ∩ A') ∩ (C ∩ A')]\n\nNow, we can use the properties of intersection to simplify the expression:\n\n= [A ∩ (B' ∩ C')] ∪ [(A ∩ C) ∩ (A' ∩ B')] ∪ [(A ∩ B) ∩ (A' ∩ C')] ∪ [(A' ∩ B') ∩ (A' ∩ C')]\n= (A ∩ B') ∪ (A' ∩ C')\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the intersections:\n\n(A ∩ B) ∆ (A ∩ C) = [(A ∩ B) - (A ∩ C)] ∪ [(A ∩ C) - (A ∩ B)]\n= (A ∩ B') ∪ (A ∩ C')\n\nComparing the two expressions, we can see that they are equal:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ C) = (A ∩ B) ∆ (A ∩ C)\n\nThus, the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection."
