    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or a non-abelian group of order 27, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince 27 = 3^3, there is at least one Sylow 3-subgroup in G. Let's denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3. According to the Sylow theorems, n_3 must divide the order of G (which is 27) and n_3 â‰¡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 9.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal in G. In this case, G would have a normal subgroup of order 3^2 = 9. Since the order of G is 27, this normal subgroup would be unique, and G would be a cyclic group of order 27. Therefore, G would be isomorphic to C27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 9\nIf there are 9 Sylow 3-subgroups, none of them are normal in G. In this case, G cannot be a cyclic group, as a cyclic group of order 27 would have a unique normal subgroup of order 9. Therefore, G must be a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about G, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or a non-abelian group of order 27. It could be either, depending on the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G."
