    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, a certain type of product defect occurs in 8% of all units produced. If a batch of 500 units is produced, what is the probability that no units in the batch will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having x defective units\n- n is the total number of units (in this case, 500)\n- x is the number of defective units (in this case, we want 0 defective units)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (8% or 0.08)\n- q is the probability of a unit not being defective (1 - p = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated using the formula: n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nFor this problem, we want to find the probability of having 0 defective units, so we will plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(0) = (500C0) * (0.08^0) * (0.92^500)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 500C0:\n500C0 = 500! / (0! * (500-0)!) = 1 (since any number of items taken 0 at a time is always 1)\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.08^0:\n0.08^0 = 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is always 1)\n\nFinally, let's calculate 0.92^500:\n0.92^500 ≈ 2.041e-19 (using a calculator)\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(0) = 1 * 1 * 2.041e-19 ≈ 2.041e-19\n\nSo, the probability of having no defective units in a batch of 500 units is approximately 2.041e-19, or 2.041 * 10^-19."
