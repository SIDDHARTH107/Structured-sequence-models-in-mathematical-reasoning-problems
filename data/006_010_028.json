    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success in a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the probability of at least 3 people in the specific demographic group being affected by the disease. So, we need to find the probability of 3, 4, 5, ..., up to the maximum number of people in the demographic group being affected.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of a person from the specific demographic group being affected by the disease. Since the overall prevalence of the disease is 10% and the proportion of this demographic group in the population is 20%, the probability of a person from this demographic group being affected by the disease is:\n\nP(disease | demographic group) = 0.10 * 0.20 = 0.02\n\nNow, let's find the number of people in the demographic group in our sample of 500 people:\n\nn_demographic_group = 500 * 0.20 = 100\n\nNow we can use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of at least 3 people in the demographic group being affected by the disease. To do this, we will find the probability of 0, 1, and 2 people being affected and then subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1:\n\nP(X >= 3) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2)\n\nWe can calculate the probabilities for X = 0, 1, and 2 using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * 0.02^0 * (1-0.02)^(100-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.98^100 ≈ 0.017\n\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * 0.02^1 * (1-0.02)^(100-1) = 100 * 0.02 * 0.98^99 ≈ 0.085\n\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * 0.02^2 * (1-0.02)^(100-2) = 4950 * 0.0004 * 0.98^98 ≈ 0.195\n\nNow we can find the probability of at least 3 people being affected:\n\nP(X >= 3) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2) = 1 - 0.017 - 0.085 - 0.195 ≈ 0.703\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 people in the specific demographic group will be affected by the disease is approximately 70.3%."
