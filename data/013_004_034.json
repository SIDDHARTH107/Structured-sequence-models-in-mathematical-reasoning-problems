    "message_1": "In a Battle of the Sexes game, a husband and wife must decide where to go on their date. The husband prefers to go see an action movie, while the wife would like to go watch a romantic comedy. If they both go to the same movie, they will each get 4 units of pleasure. However, if they go to different movies, the husband will get 1 unit of pleasure and the wife will get 3 units of pleasure. If the husband and wife both randomly choose a movie, what is the expected value of the husband's pleasure?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the husband's pleasure, we need to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities. There are four possible outcomes:\n\n1. Both choose the action movie (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n2. Both choose the romantic comedy (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n3. Husband chooses action movie, wife chooses romantic comedy (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n4. Husband chooses romantic comedy, wife chooses action movie (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n\nNow, let's calculate the husband's pleasure for each outcome:\n\n1. Both choose the action movie: 4 units of pleasure\n2. Both choose the romantic comedy: 4 units of pleasure\n3. Husband chooses action movie, wife chooses romantic comedy: 1 unit of pleasure\n4. Husband chooses romantic comedy, wife chooses action movie: 3 units of pleasure\n\nFinally, we can calculate the expected value by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the husband's pleasure for that outcome and summing the results:\n\nExpected value = (1/4 * 4) + (1/4 * 4) + (1/4 * 1) + (1/4 * 3)\nExpected value = 1 + 1 + 0.25 + 0.75\nExpected value = 3\n\nSo, the expected value of the husband's pleasure is 3 units."
