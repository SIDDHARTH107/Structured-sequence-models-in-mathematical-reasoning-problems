    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $v$ along the curve $\\gamma$, we need to solve the following equation for the parallel transport vector $w(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{Dw}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} w = 0\n$$\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = (1, 2t, 3t^2)\n$$\n\nNow, let's write the parallel transport vector $w(t) = (w_1(t), w_2(t), w_3(t))$. The equation for parallel transport becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix} w_1(t) \\\\ w_2(t) \\\\ w_3(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\nabla_{(1, 2t, 3t^2)} \\begin{pmatrix} w_1(t) \\\\ w_2(t) \\\\ w_3(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThis equation can be written as three separate equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dw_1}{dt} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dw_2}{dt} - 2t\\frac{dw_1}{dt} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dw_3}{dt} - 3t^2\\frac{dw_1}{dt} - 2t\\frac{dw_2}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nThe first equation implies that $w_1(t) = c_1$, where $c_1$ is a constant. The second equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dw_2}{dt} = 2tc_1\n$$\n\nIntegrating this equation, we get:\n\n$$\nw_2(t) = c_1t^2 + c_2\n$$\n\nwhere $c_2$ is another constant. Now, let's substitute $w_1(t)$ and $w_2(t)$ into the third equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dw_3}{dt} - 3t^2c_1 - 2tc_1t^2 - 2tc_2 = 0\n$$\n\nIntegrating this equation, we get:\n\n$$\nw_3(t) = c_1t^3 + c_2t^2 + c_3\n$$\n\nwhere $c_3$ is another constant. Now, we have the parallel transport vector $w(t) = (c_1, c_1t^2 + c_2, c_1t^3 + c_2t^2 + c_3)$. We know that at $t = 0$, $w(0) = v = (-1, 2, 1)$. Using this condition, we can find the constants:\n\n$$\nw(0) = (c_1, c_2, c_3) = (-1, 2, 1)\n$$\n\nThus, the parallel transport vector $w(t)$ is given by:\n\n$$\nw(t) = (-1, -t^2 + 2, -t^3 + 2t^2 + 1)\n$$"
