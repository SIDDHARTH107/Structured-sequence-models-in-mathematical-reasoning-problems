    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to partition a set of 10 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets. Therefore, we need to find the value of S(10, 3).\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind formula:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can find the value of S(10, 3) by calculating the Stirling numbers for smaller values of n and k and then using the formula to find the desired value.\n\nHere's a table of Stirling numbers for n = 1 to 10 and k = 1 to 3:\n\nn\\k | 1       2       3\n-------------------------\n1   | 1       0       0\n2   | 1       1       0\n3   | 1       3       1\n4   | 1       7       6\n5   | 1       15      25\n6   | 1       31      90\n7   | 1       63      301\n8   | 1       127     966\n9   | 1       255     3025\n10  | 1       511     9330\n\nFrom the table, we can see that S(10, 3) = 9330. Therefore, there are 9330 ways to partition a set of 10 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
