    "message_1": "A thin bar of length 1 meter and thermal conductivity 1 W/mK is initially at a temperature of 50°C. One end of the bar is held at a constant temperature of 100°C, while the other end is insulated. Use the Fourier transform method to determine the temperature distribution at any point in the bar at a time of 5 seconds given the initial temperature distribution is uniform along the bar.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = k * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the bar, and k is the thermal conductivity.\n\nSince we are given the initial temperature distribution (uniform at 50°C) and boundary conditions (one end at 100°C and the other end insulated), we can use the Fourier transform method to solve the heat conduction equation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Fourier series representation of the initial temperature distribution. The general form of the Fourier series is:\n\nT(x, 0) = A₀ + Σ[Aₙ * cos(n * π * x / L) + Bₙ * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere A₀, Aₙ, and Bₙ are the Fourier coefficients, L is the length of the bar (1 meter), and n is an integer.\n\nSince the initial temperature distribution is uniform at 50°C, we have:\n\nT(x, 0) = 50\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier coefficients. We can do this by integrating the product of the temperature distribution and the corresponding trigonometric functions over the length of the bar and dividing by the length:\n\nA₀ = (2 / L) * ∫[T(x, 0) * 1] dx from 0 to L\nAₙ = (2 / L) * ∫[T(x, 0) * cos(n * π * x / L)] dx from 0 to L\nBₙ = (2 / L) * ∫[T(x, 0) * sin(n * π * x / L)] dx from 0 to L\n\nSince T(x, 0) = 50, we have:\n\nA₀ = (2 / 1) * ∫[50 * 1] dx from 0 to 1 = 100\nAₙ = (2 / 1) * ∫[50 * cos(n * π * x)] dx from 0 to 1 = 0 (due to symmetry)\nBₙ = (2 / 1) * ∫[50 * sin(n * π * x)] dx from 0 to 1 = (100 / nπ) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of the temperature distribution at any time t:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 + Σ[(100 / nπ) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(n * π * x) * e^(-k * (n * π)^2 * t)]\n\nSince k = 1 W/mK, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 5 seconds:\n\nT(x, 5) = 100 + Σ[(100 / nπ) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(n * π * x) * e^(-(n * π)^2 * 5)]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution at any point in the bar at a time of 5 seconds. Note that the series converges, so you can approximate the temperature distribution by taking a finite number of terms."
