    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a sum of 10 with a pair of standard six-sided dice, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a sum of 10) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (all possible rolls with two dice).\n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. \n\nNow, let's find the combinations that result in a sum of 10:\n1. Die 1 rolls a 4, and Die 2 rolls a 6 (4+6=10)\n2. Die 1 rolls a 6, and Die 2 rolls a 4 (6+4=10)\n3. Die 1 rolls a 5, and Die 2 rolls a 5 (5+5=10)\n\nThere are 3 favorable outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a sum of 10 with a pair of standard six-sided dice is:\n\nP(sum of 10) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 3/36 = 1/12\n\nThe probability of rolling a sum of 10 is 1/12 or approximately 0.0833 or 8.33%."
