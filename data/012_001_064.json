    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node D, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D}\n2. Assign tentative distances to all nodes: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞\n3. Set the current node as A.\n\nNow, we'll iterate through the unvisited neighbors of the current node (A) and update their tentative distances:\n\n- For node B: tentative distance from A is 4 (A->B)\n- For node C: tentative distance from A is 2 (A->C)\n- For node D: tentative distance from A is 6 (A->D)\n\nMark node A as visited.\n\n4. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node. In this case, it's node C with a distance of 2.\n\nNow, we'll iterate through the unvisited neighbors of the current node (C) and update their tentative distances:\n\n- For node B: tentative distance from A through C is 5 (A->C->B). Since this is greater than the current tentative distance of 4 (A->B), we don't update it.\n- For node D: tentative distance from A through C is 7 (A->C->D). Since this is greater than the current tentative distance of 6 (A->D), we don't update it.\n\nMark node C as visited.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node. In this case, it's node B with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, we'll iterate through the unvisited neighbors of the current node (B) and update their tentative distances:\n\n- For node D: tentative distance from A through B is 5 (A->B->D). Since this is less than the current tentative distance of 6 (A->D), we update it to 5.\n\nMark node B as visited.\n\n6. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node. In this case, it's node D with a distance of 5.\n\nMark node D as visited.\n\n7. We have now visited all nodes, and the shortest path from node A to node D is A->B->D with a total distance of 5."
