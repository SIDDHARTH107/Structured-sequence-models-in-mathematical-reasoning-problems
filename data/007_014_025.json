    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The smallest perfect number is 6, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, and 3.\n\nPerfect numbers can be found using the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from the study of Mersenne primes, which are prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^p - 1.\n\nLet's find the first four perfect numbers using this formula:\n\n1. For p = 2, 2^p - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3, which is prime.\n   So, the first perfect number is 2^(2-1) * (2^2 - 1) = 2^1 * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n2. For p = 3, 2^p - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7, which is prime.\n   So, the second perfect number is 2^(3-1) * (2^3 - 1) = 2^2 * 7 = 4 * 7 = 28.\n\n3. For p = 5, 2^p - 1 = 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31, which is prime.\n   So, the third perfect number is 2^(5-1) * (2^5 - 1) = 2^4 * 31 = 16 * 31 = 496.\n\n4. For p = 7, 2^p - 1 = 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127, which is prime.\n   So, the fourth perfect number is 2^(7-1) * (2^7 - 1) = 2^6 * 127 = 64 * 127 = 8128.\n\nThus, the first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128."
