    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2  1 |       x = | x |       b = | 13 |\n    | 2 -4  3 |           | y |           | -1 |\n    | 1  1 -1 |           | z |           |  5 |\n\nNow, we'll perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we'll find an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the QR decomposition of A:\n\nQ = | -0.8018  0.5345  0.2673 |\n    | -0.5345 -0.8018 -0.2673 |\n    | -0.2673  0.2673 -0.8018 |\n\nR = | -3.7417 -1.6036  1.6036 |\n    |  0      4.5345 -2.6726 |\n    |  0      0      1.0690 |\n\nNow we need to solve the equation Rx = Q^Tb for x. First, we'll find Q^Tb:\n\nQ^Tb = | -0.8018  -0.5345  -0.2673 | | 13 |\n       |  0.5345  -0.8018   0.2673 | |-1  |\n       |  0.2673  -0.2673  -0.8018 | | 5  |\n\nQ^Tb = | -9.6036 |\n       |  7.3362 |\n       | -3.2041 |\n\nNow we have the equation Rx = Q^Tb:\n\n| -3.7417 -1.6036  1.6036 | | x |   | -9.6036 |\n|  0      4.5345 -2.6726 | | y | = |  7.3362 |\n|  0      0      1.0690 | | z |   | -3.2041 |\n\nWe can solve this system using back-substitution:\n\nz = -3.2041 / 1.0690 ≈ -3.00\ny = (7.3362 + 2.6726 * -3.00) / 4.5345 ≈ 2.00\nx = (-9.6036 + 1.6036 * 2.00 + 1.6036 * -3.00) / -3.7417 ≈ 3.00\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x = 3.00, y = 2.00, and z = -3.00."
