    "message_2": "A closed, orientable 2-manifold M of genus 2 is a compact, boundaryless surface that can be described as a connected sum of two tori (T^2). In other words, M is formed by taking two tori and gluing them together along a small disk removed from each.\n\nThe classification of differentiable structures on closed, orientable 2-manifolds is given by the theorem of Smale, which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of differentiable structures on a closed, orientable 2-manifold and the set of homotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the manifold to itself.\n\nFor a closed, orientable 2-manifold of genus 2, there is only one homotopy class of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, which corresponds to the identity map. This is because the mapping class group of a closed, orientable surface of genus g > 1 is a finite group, and the identity map is the only element in the center of this group.\n\nTherefore, there is only one non-isomorphic differentiable structure on a closed, orientable 2-manifold of genus 2."
