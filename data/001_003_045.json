    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n(2x + 3y) * 2 = 10 * 2\n4x + 6y = 20\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 20\n4x - y = 8\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - y) = 20 - 8\n4x + 6y - 4x + y = 12\n7y = 12\n\nNow, divide by 7 to find the value of y:\n\ny = 12 / 7\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find the value of x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 10\n2x + 3(12/7) = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 7 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2x * 7 + 3 * 12 = 10 * 7\n14x + 36 = 70\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides:\n\n14x = 34\n\nNow, divide by 14 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 34 / 14\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 34/14\ny = 12/7"
