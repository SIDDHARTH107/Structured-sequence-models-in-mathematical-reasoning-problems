    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of 80 shoppers in a market,at least 10 will purchase a product when the probability of a single shopper purchasing the product is 0.3?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (shoppers purchasing the product) in n trials (total shoppers), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.3 in this case), and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 10 shoppers purchasing the product, which means we need to find the probability of 10, 11, 12, ..., 80 shoppers purchasing the product and sum them up. Alternatively, we can find the probability of 0 to 9 shoppers purchasing the product and subtract it from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of 0 to 9 shoppers purchasing the product:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ [C(80, k) * (0.3)^k * (0.7)^(80-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can use a calculator or software to compute the sum:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) ≈ 0.0573\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 10 shoppers purchasing the product:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - 0.0573\n\nP(X ≥ 10) ≈ 0.9427\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 out of 80 shoppers will purchase the product is approximately 0.9427 or 94.27%."
