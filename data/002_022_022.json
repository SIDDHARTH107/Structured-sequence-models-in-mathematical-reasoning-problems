    "message_2": "To find the volume of the torus, we need to know the major radius (R) and the minor radius (r). The major radius is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circular cross-section, and the minor radius is the radius of the circular cross-section itself.\n\nWe are given that the metal rod has a length of 10 cm and is bent to form a torus with a radius of the circle forming the torus as 3 cm. This means that the circumference of the circular cross-section (minor circle) is 10 cm. We can use this information to find the minor radius (r).\n\nCircumference of the minor circle = 2 * pi * r\n10 = 2 * pi * r\nr = 10 / (2 * pi)\nr ≈ 1.59154943092 cm\n\nNow, we know that the radius of the circle forming the torus is 3 cm. This is actually the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circular cross-section, which is the major radius (R).\n\nR = 3 cm\n\nNow that we have both the major radius (R) and the minor radius (r), we can find the volume of the torus using the following formula:\n\nVolume of torus = 2 * pi^2 * R * r^2\nVolume ≈ 2 * pi^2 * 3 * (1.59154943092)^2\nVolume ≈ 60.2179148268 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 60.22 cm^3."
