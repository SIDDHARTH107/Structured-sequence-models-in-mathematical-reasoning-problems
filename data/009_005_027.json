    "message_2": "To determine the differential equation that governs the current in the circuit, we can use Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), which states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop is equal to zero. In this case, the loop consists of the voltage source, resistor, inductor, and capacitor.\n\nThe voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law: V_R = R * i(t), where R is the resistance and i(t) is the current as a function of time.\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is given by V_L = L * di(t)/dt, where L is the inductance and di(t)/dt is the time derivative of the current.\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is given by V_C = 1/C * ∫i(t) dt, where C is the capacitance and ∫i(t) dt is the integral of the current with respect to time.\n\nApplying KVL, we have:\n\nV_source - V_R - V_L - V_C = 0\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the voltages, we get:\n\n12 - 10 * i(t) - 0.5 * di(t)/dt - 1/(100 * 10^(-6)) * ∫i(t) dt = 0\n\nDifferentiating the equation with respect to time, we obtain the second-order differential equation:\n\n0 - 10 * di(t)/dt - 0.5 * d^2i(t)/dt^2 + 1/(100 * 10^(-6)) * i(t) = 0\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n0.5 * d^2i(t)/dt^2 + 10 * di(t)/dt + 1/(100 * 10^(-6)) * i(t) = 12\n\nThis is the governing differential equation for the current in the circuit.\n\nTo solve for the current over time, we can use the Laplace transform method. Taking the Laplace transform of the differential equation, we get:\n\n0.5 * s^2 * I(s) + 10 * s * I(s) + 1/(100 * 10^(-6)) * I(s) = 12 / s\n\nSimplifying and solving for I(s):\n\nI(s) = 12 / (0.5 * s^2 + 10 * s + 1/(100 * 10^(-6)))\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of I(s) to obtain the current i(t) as a function of time. This can be done using partial fraction decomposition and inverse Laplace transform tables.\n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of I(s) is:\n\ni(t) = A * e^(-αt) * cos(ωt) + B * e^(-αt) * sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A, B, α, and ω are constants that can be determined by comparing the coefficients in the partial fraction decomposition.\n\nGiven the initial condition that i(0) = 0 A, we can solve for the constants and obtain the current i(t) as a function of time."
