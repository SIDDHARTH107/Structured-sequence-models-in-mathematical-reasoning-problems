    "message_2": "The largest sphere that can fit inside a cube will have a diameter equal to the side length of the cube. In this case, the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm. The radius of the sphere will be half of the diameter, which is 3 cm.\n\nThe volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nSubstituting the given radius into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3)^3\nV = (4/3)π(27)\nV = (4)(3.14159)(9)\nV ≈ 113.097 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the largest sphere that can fit inside the cube is approximately 113.097 cubic centimeters."
