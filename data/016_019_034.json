    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side of the Koch curve is multiplied by 4/3. \n\nAfter the 5th iteration, the length of each side of the Koch curve will be (4/3)^5 times the original side length. \n\nSo, the length of each side of the Koch curve after the 5th iteration is:\n\n(4/3)^5 * 3 = 3 * (1024/243) ≈ 12.586\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, the perimeter of the Koch island after the 5th iteration is:\n\n3 * 12.586 ≈ 37.758 units."
