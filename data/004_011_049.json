    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall while sliding down slowly. At the starting point, the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall and 8 feet high on the wall. The ladder's base is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. At what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base is 4 feet from the wall? (Round your answer to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the height of the ladder on the wall. We are given that dx/dt = 2 ft/s (the rate at which the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall) and we want to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 4 ft.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y since the ladder, wall, and ground form a right triangle:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = L^2\n\nwhere L is the length of the ladder. At the starting point, the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall and 8 feet high on the wall, so we can find the length of the ladder:\n\n6^2 + 8^2 = L^2\n36 + 64 = L^2\n100 = L^2\nL = 10 ft\n\nNow we can differentiate the equation with respect to time:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe know that dx/dt = 2 ft/s and we want to find dy/dt when x = 4 ft. To do this, we need to find the value of y when x = 4 ft. Using the Pythagorean theorem again:\n\n4^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n16 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 84\ny = √84\n\nNow we can plug in the values of x, dx/dt, and y into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(4)(2) + 2(√84)(dy/dt) = 0\n16 + 2(√84)(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(√84)(dy/dt) = -16\ndy/dt = -16 / (2(√84))\ndy/dt ≈ -1.39 ft/s\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of approximately 1.39 ft/s when the base is 4 feet from the wall."
