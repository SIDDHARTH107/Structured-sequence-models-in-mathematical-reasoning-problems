    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = cos(x) for x in the interval [0, 2π), we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Express cos(x) in terms of sin(x) using the Pythagorean identity: sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n   cos(x) = ±√(1 - sin^2(x))\n\n2. Substitute cos(x) with ±√(1 - sin^2(x)) in the given equation:\n   2sin(x) + 1 = ±√(1 - sin^2(x))\n\n3. Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n   (2sin(x) + 1)^2 = (±√(1 - sin^2(x)))^2\n   4sin^2(x) + 4sin(x) + 1 = 1 - sin^2(x)\n\n4. Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation in sin(x):\n   5sin^2(x) + 4sin(x) = 0\n\n5. Factor the quadratic equation:\n   sin(x)(5sin(x) + 4) = 0\n\n6. Solve for sin(x):\n   sin(x) = 0\n   5sin(x) + 4 = 0 => sin(x) = -4/5\n\n7. Find the values of x for each value of sin(x) in the interval [0, 2π):\n   For sin(x) = 0:\n   x = arcsin(0) = 0, π\n\n   For sin(x) = -4/5:\n   x = arcsin(-4/5) ≈ -0.9273 (not in the interval [0, 2π))\n   To find the values in the interval [0, 2π), we can use the property sin(π - x) = sin(x) and sin(π + x) = -sin(x):\n   x = π - (-0.9273) ≈ 1.0682 (in the interval [0, 2π))\n   x = π + (-0.9273) ≈ 2.2143 (in the interval [0, 2π))\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π) are x = 0, π, 1.0682, and 2.2143."
