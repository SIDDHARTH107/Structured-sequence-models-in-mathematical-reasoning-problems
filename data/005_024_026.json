    "message_2": "Let's first find the total age of the first 35 people and the total age needed for all 50 people to have an average age of 32 years.\n\nTotal age of first 35 people = average age * number of people = 30 years * 35 = 1050 years\n\nTotal age needed for all 50 people to have an average age of 32 years = average age * number of people = 32 years * 50 = 1600 years\n\nNow, let's find the total age needed for the remaining 15 people to achieve the desired average age.\n\nTotal age needed for remaining 15 people = Total age needed for all 50 people - Total age of first 35 people = 1600 years - 1050 years = 550 years\n\nFinally, let's find the average age of the remaining 15 people.\n\nAverage age of remaining 15 people = Total age needed for remaining 15 people / number of people = 550 years / 15 = 36.67 years\n\nSo, the average age of the remaining 15 people must be 36.67 years to achieve a total average age of 32 years for all 50 people in the data set."
