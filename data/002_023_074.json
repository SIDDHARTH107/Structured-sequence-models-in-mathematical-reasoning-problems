    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. Since the diameter is 10 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 5 cm.\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\nSurface area = 100π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 cm^2 (using π ≈ 3.1416)."
