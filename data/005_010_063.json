    "message_1": "A company manufactures light bulbs, and the quality control department randomly selects 100 light bulbs to test. The department found that 20% of the light bulbs were defective. The production department realized that a certain machine was not properly functioning during the production of those 100 light bulbs. The machine has been fixed, and the production department wants to estimate the new proportion of defective light bulbs. Using Bayesian statistics, what is the probability that the proportion of defective light bulbs is now less than 10%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we need to define a prior distribution, likelihood function, and then calculate the posterior distribution. We will use a Beta distribution as our prior and likelihood function since it is a conjugate prior for the binomial distribution, which is appropriate for modeling the proportion of defective light bulbs.\n\n1. Prior distribution: Since we don't have any information about the proportion of defective light bulbs before the machine was fixed, we will use a non-informative prior. A common choice for this is the Beta(1, 1) distribution, which is equivalent to a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.\n\n2. Likelihood function: The likelihood function is the probability of observing the data (20 defective light bulbs out of 100) given the proportion of defective light bulbs (p). This can be modeled using a binomial distribution: Binomial(n=100, p).\n\n3. Posterior distribution: The posterior distribution is the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function, which can be calculated analytically for the Beta-binomial conjugate pair. In this case, the posterior distribution is Beta(1 + number of defective light bulbs, 1 + number of non-defective light bulbs) = Beta(1 + 20, 1 + 80) = Beta(21, 81).\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the proportion of defective light bulbs is less than 10% (0.1) given the posterior distribution. This can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Beta distribution:\n\nP(p < 0.1 | data) = CDF_Beta(0.1; 21, 81)\n\nUsing a calculator or statistical software, we find that:\n\nP(p < 0.1 | data) â‰ˆ 0.983\n\nSo, there is approximately a 98.3% probability that the proportion of defective light bulbs is now less than 10% after the machine has been fixed."
