    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in length as its order increases. The length of a Hilbert curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * 4^(n-1)\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, we have:\n\nLength = (2^3 - 1) * 4^(3-1)\nLength = (8 - 1) * 4^2\nLength = 7 * 16\nLength = 112 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve when n=3 is 112 units."
