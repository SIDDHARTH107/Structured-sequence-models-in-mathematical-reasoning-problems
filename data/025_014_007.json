    "message_2": "First, we need to find the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. The curve $C$ is a smooth projective curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-t)$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = x(x-1)(x-t)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$. The genus of a hyperelliptic curve can be determined using the formula $g = \\frac{d-1}{2}$, where $d$ is the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$. In this case, $d = 3$, so the genus $g$ of the curve $C$ is:\n\n$$\ng = \\frac{3-1}{2} = 1.\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find a divisor $D$ on $C$ of degree $2$ such that $\\mathrm{dim}\\,\\mathrm{L}(D) = 2$. Let $D = P_1 + P_2$, where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are distinct points on the curve $C$. Since the curve is hyperelliptic, there exists a unique point $Q$ on the curve such that $D = P_1 + P_2 \\sim 2Q$. Therefore, the linear system $\\mathrm{L}(D)$ contains the constant functions and the function $x(Q) - x(P_1)$, which has a pole of order $2$ at $Q$ and zeroes of order $1$ at $P_1$ and $P_2$. Thus, $\\mathrm{L}(D)$ has dimension $2$.\n\nTo summarize, the genus $g$ of the curve $C$ is $1$, and a divisor $D$ on $C$ of degree $2$ such that $\\mathrm{dim}\\,\\mathrm{L}(D) = 2$ is given by $D = P_1 + P_2$, where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are distinct points on the curve $C$."
