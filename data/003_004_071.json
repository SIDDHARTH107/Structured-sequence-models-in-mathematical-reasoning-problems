    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) - 1 = 0 for x between 0 and 360 degrees, follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(x) by adding 1 to both sides of the equation and then dividing by 2:\n\n2sin(x) - 1 + 1 = 0 + 1\n2sin(x) = 1\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\n2. Find the angles x for which sin(x) = 1/2 in the given range (0 to 360 degrees):\n\nx = arcsin(1/2)\n\nx = 30 degrees (since sin(30) = 1/2)\nx = 150 degrees (since sin(150) = 1/2)\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x = 30 degrees and x = 150 degrees."
