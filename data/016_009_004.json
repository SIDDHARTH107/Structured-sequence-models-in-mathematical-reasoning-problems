    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by following a recursive process. The number of line segments in each iteration of the Dragon curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 10th iteration of the Dragon curve:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^10 = 1024"
