    "message_1": "A ladder 10 meters long is leaning against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 meters per second. At what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 meters away from the wall? (Assume the ladder is sliding on a frictionless surface.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that dx/dt = 2 m/s (the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall), and we want to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 6 m. To do this, we first need to find the value of y when x = 6 m:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSolve for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -24\ndy/dt = -24/16\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 m/s (negative sign indicates the downward direction) when the bottom of the ladder is 6 meters away from the wall."
