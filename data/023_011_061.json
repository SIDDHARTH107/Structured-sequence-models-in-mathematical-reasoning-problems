    "message_2": "To find the number of samples required to completely represent the signal in the frequency domain, we can use the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. According to this theorem, the sampling rate should be at least twice the bandwidth of the signal to avoid aliasing and completely represent the signal.\n\nIn this case, the bandwidth of the signal is 500 Hz, so the minimum required sampling rate is 2 * 500 Hz = 1000 Hz, which is the given sampling rate.\n\nNow, to find the number of samples required, we can multiply the sampling rate by the duration of the signal:\n\nNumber of samples = Sampling rate * Duration\nNumber of samples = 1000 Hz * 0.01 seconds\nNumber of samples = 10\n\nSo, 10 samples are required to completely represent the signal in the frequency domain."
