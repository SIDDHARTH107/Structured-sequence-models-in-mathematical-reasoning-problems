    "message_1": "A company allows its employees to work remotely. The productivity of an employee when working in the office is 10, but when working from home, the productivity is reduced due to moral hazard, and the productivity follows a normal distribution with a mean of 8 and a standard deviation of 1.5. The company offers a bonus of $100 to its employees who work from home to motivate them to maintain their productivity. What should be the minimum productivity threshold for an employee to receive the bonus?",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum productivity threshold for an employee to receive the bonus, we need to consider the company's goal of motivating employees to maintain their productivity. Since the productivity in the office is 10, we can use this as a reference point. However, we also need to take into account the normal distribution of productivity when working from home.\n\nOne approach is to set the threshold at the top percentage of the distribution, such as the 90th percentile. This would mean that only the top 10% of remote workers who maintain high productivity would receive the bonus.\n\nTo find the 90th percentile of the normal distribution, we can use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere z is the z-score, X is the value we want to find, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. We can look up the z-score for the 90th percentile in a standard normal distribution table, which is approximately 1.28.\n\nNow we can solve for X:\n\n1.28 = (X - 8) / 1.5\n\n1.28 * 1.5 = X - 8\n\n1.92 = X - 8\n\nX = 9.92\n\nSo, the minimum productivity threshold for an employee to receive the bonus should be approximately 9.92. This means that only remote employees with a productivity of 9.92 or higher would receive the $100 bonus."
