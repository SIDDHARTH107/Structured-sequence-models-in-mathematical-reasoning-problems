    "message_1": "A warehouse has a total area of 1200 square meters, and you need to store two types of products: boxes and containers. The cost of storing a box is $2 per square meter, and the cost of storing a container is $4 per square meter. You can allocate a maximum of 600 square meters for boxes and 800 square meters for containers. If you aim to minimize storage costs, how many square meters should you allocate for each type of product? Use quadratic programming to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the storage costs, we can set up a quadratic programming problem. Let x be the area allocated for boxes and y be the area allocated for containers. The objective function to minimize is the total cost:\n\nCost = 2x + 4y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx ≤ 600 (maximum area for boxes)\ny ≤ 800 (maximum area for containers)\nx + y ≤ 1200 (total warehouse area)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints in the standard form for quadratic programming:\n\nx - 600 ≤ 0\ny - 800 ≤ 0\nx + y - 1200 ≤ 0\n-x ≤ 0\n-y ≤ 0\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic programming problem. Since the objective function is linear, we can solve it using linear programming methods. Using the simplex method or graphical method, we find the optimal solution at the intersection of the constraints x + y = 1200 and x = 600:\n\nx = 600\ny = 600\n\nSo, to minimize storage costs, you should allocate 600 square meters for boxes and 600 square meters for containers."
