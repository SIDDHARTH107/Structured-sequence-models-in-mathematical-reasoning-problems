They collected data from 20 employees where age (in years) is the independent variable and salary (in thousands of dollars per year) is the dependent variable. Using multivariate analysis, determine the regression equation that best fits the data. \n\nHere is the data:\n```\nEmployee Age (X)  |  Salary (Y)\n---------------------------------\n        28        |     50     \n        35        |     70     \n        42        |     80     \n        24        |     45     \n        30        |     60     \n        37        |     75     \n        48        |     90     \n        22        |     40     \n        29        |     55     \n        36        |     72     \n        42        |     78     \n        25        |     47     \n        31        |     62     \n        38        |     77     \n        50        |     92     \n        26        |     50     \n        33        |     65     \n        39        |     79     \n        46        |     85     \n        27        |     54     \n```\nWhat is the regression equation that best fits this data using multivariate analysis?",
    "message_2": "To find the regression equation that best fits this data, we will use the method of least squares for simple linear regression. The equation for a simple linear regression is Y = a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable (salary), X is the independent variable (age), a is the intercept, and b is the slope.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean of X (age) and Y (salary):\n\nMean of X (age) = (28+35+42+24+30+37+48+22+29+36+42+25+31+38+50+26+33+39+46+27)/20 = 34.25\nMean of Y (salary) = (50+70+80+45+60+75+90+40+55+72+78+47+62+77+92+50+65+79+85+54)/20 = 65.15\n\nNext, we need to calculate the covariance of X and Y (Cov(X,Y)) and the variance of X (Var(X)):\n\nCov(X,Y) = Σ[(Xi - mean of X) * (Yi - mean of Y)] / (n - 1)\nVar(X) = Σ[(Xi - mean of X)^2] / (n - 1)\n\nCov(X,Y) = 1012.63\nVar(X) = 68.71\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (b) and the intercept (a):\n\nb = Cov(X,Y) / Var(X) = 1012.63 / 68.71 = 14.74\na = mean of Y - b * mean of X = 65.15 - 14.74 * 34.25 = -438.98\n\nSo, the regression equation that best fits this data is:\n\nY = -438.98 + 14.74X"
