    "message_1": "A manufacturing process produces light bulbs. The probability that a bulb is defective is 0.03. If a random sample of 100 bulbs is selected, what is the probability that exactly two of them are defective?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective bulbs\n- n is the total number of bulbs in the sample (100 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs we want to find the probability for (2 in this case)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k defective bulbs from n total bulbs, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a single bulb being defective (0.03 in this case)\n- 1-p is the probability of a single bulb not being defective (1 - 0.03 = 0.97 in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 2) = (100C2) * (0.03^2) * (0.97^98)\n\nFirst, we calculate 100C2:\n\n100C2 = 100! / (2!(100-2)!) = 100! / (2! * 98!) = (100 * 99) / (2 * 1) = 4950\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = 4950 * (0.03^2) * (0.97^98)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n0.03^2 = 0.0009\n0.97^98 ≈ 0.0474\n\nNow, multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 2) ≈ 4950 * 0.0009 * 0.0474 ≈ 0.211\n\nSo, the probability that exactly two bulbs are defective in a random sample of 100 bulbs is approximately 0.211 or 21.1%."
