    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given $100 and decides how to split the amount with Player 2. Player 2 can either accept the split or reject it, in which case neither player receives any money. If Player 2 accepts the split, how much money should Player 1 offer to maximize their own payoff? Assume that Player 2 is rational and would accept any non-zero split.",
    "message_2": "If Player 2 is rational and would accept any non-zero split, then Player 1 should offer the smallest possible non-zero amount to Player 2 to maximize their own payoff. In this case, Player 1 can offer $1 to Player 2 and keep $99 for themselves. This way, Player 1 maximizes their own payoff while still giving Player 2 a non-zero amount, which they will accept."
