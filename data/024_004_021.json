    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point P(1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by the variables u and v, where u = x and v = y. Then, the parameterization is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u · r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u · r_v = 4uv\nG = r_v · r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\ne = r_uu · N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nf = r_uv · N = 0\ng = r_vv · N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface, which can be found by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v and then normalizing it.\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H using the following formula:\n\nH = (eG - 2fF + gE) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point P(1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. So, we can plug in these values and compute the mean curvature:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\ne = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2) = 1/3\nf = 0\ng = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2) = 1/3\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for H:\n\nH = (1/3 * 5 - 2 * 0 + 1/3 * 5) / (2(5 * 5 - 4^2))\nH = (10/3) / (2(25 - 16))\nH = (10/3) / 18\nH = 5/9\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point P(1, 1, 2) is H = 5/9."
