    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve, is a space-filling curve that starts with an equilateral triangle and builds upon it by replacing each segment with a specific pattern. The perimeter of the Gosper curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the perimeter at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial length) * (scaling factor)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations and the scaling factor is 7/3 (since each segment is replaced by 7 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment).\n\nLet's assume the initial length of the equilateral triangle is 1 unit. Then, the perimeter of the 4th iteration of the Gosper curve can be calculated as follows:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (7/3)^4\nPerimeter ≈ 1 * 2401/81\nPerimeter ≈ 29.64198\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 4th iteration of the Gosper curve is approximately 29.64198 units."
