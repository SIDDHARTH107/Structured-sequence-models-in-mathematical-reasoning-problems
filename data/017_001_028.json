    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nLet G be a group of order 4. We will consider two cases: G has an element of order 4, or G does not have an element of order 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet g be an element of G with order 4. Then, the subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>, has the elements {e, g, g^2, g^3}, where e is the identity element. Since G has 4 elements and <g> has 4 elements, G = <g>. Therefore, G is a cyclic group generated by g, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 4.\nSince G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. We already ruled out the case where G has an element of order 4. The identity element e has order 1, so there must be at least one element of order 2.\n\nLet a be an element of order 2 in G. Then, G contains the elements {e, a}. Since G has 4 elements, there are two more elements left to consider. Let b be another element in G, different from e and a. If b has order 2, then G contains the elements {e, a, b, ab} (note that ab ≠ a and ab ≠ b, because if ab = a, then b = e, which is a contradiction, and similarly for ab = b). In this case, G is the Klein four-group V4.\n\nIf b has order 4, then we are back to Case 1, which we already ruled out. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 4, then G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 or to the Klein four-group V4."
