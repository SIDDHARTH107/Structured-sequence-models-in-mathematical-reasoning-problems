    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, every subset of X is an open set. A set is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nLet's consider each subset:\n\nA = {1, 2}: The open cover {{1}, {2}} has a finite subcover, which is itself. So, A is compact.\n\nB = {2, 3}: The open cover {{2}, {3}} has a finite subcover, which is itself. So, B is compact.\n\nC = {1}: The open cover {{1}} has a finite subcover, which is itself. So, C is compact.\n\nTherefore, all three subsets A, B, and C are compact with respect to the discrete topology on X."
