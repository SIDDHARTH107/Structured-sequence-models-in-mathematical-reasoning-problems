    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nWe are given V = 8 and E = 15. We need to find the minimum genus g for which the graph can be embedded without crossing edges.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of edges E_max for a planar graph with 8 vertices:\n\nE_max = 3V - 6 = 3(8) - 6 = 18\n\nSince the number of edges in our graph (15) is less than the maximum number of edges for a planar graph with 8 vertices (18), it is possible that the graph is planar (genus 0). However, we need to check if the graph satisfies the condition for planarity.\n\nA necessary condition for planarity is that the average degree of the graph is less than 6:\n\n(2 * E) / V < 6\n\n(2 * 15) / 8 = 30 / 8 = 3.75\n\nSince the average degree is less than 6, the graph might be planar. However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee planarity. We would need to analyze the specific structure of the graph to determine if it is indeed planar.\n\nIf the graph is planar, then the genus is 0. If the graph is not planar, we can use the Euler's formula to find the minimum genus:\n\n2 - 2g = V - E + F\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for g:\n\ng = (V - E + F - 2) / 2\n\nSince we don't know the number of faces F, we can't directly calculate the genus. However, we can find an upper bound for the genus by assuming the minimum number of faces (F = 1):\n\ng â‰¤ (V - E + 1 - 2) / 2 = (8 - 15 + 1 - 2) / 2 = -4\n\nSince the genus must be a non-negative integer, the minimum genus for the graph is 0, which means the graph is planar."
