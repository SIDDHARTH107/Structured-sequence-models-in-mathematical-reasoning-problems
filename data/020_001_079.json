    "message_1": "A toy company produces two types of dolls, A and B. The company earns a profit of $8 per unit on dolls A and $10 per unit on dolls B. Each doll of type A requires 3 pounds of plastic and 2 hours of labor. Each doll of type B requires 2 pounds of plastic and 4 hours of labor. The company has 1200 pounds of plastic available and 800 hours of labor in a given week. What is the maximum profit the company can earn per week if they have to produce at least 200 dolls of type A and 100 dolls of type B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of dolls of type A and y be the number of dolls of type B.\n\nThe profit function is given by P(x, y) = 8x + 10y.\n\nThe constraints are given by the following inequalities:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 1200 (plastic constraint)\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 800 (labor constraint)\n3. x ≥ 200 (minimum production of type A dolls)\n4. y ≥ 100 (minimum production of type B dolls)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. y ≤ (1200 - 3x) / 2\n2. y ≤ (800 - 2x) / 4\n3. x ≥ 200\n4. y ≥ 100\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nA. Intersection of inequalities 1 and 3: (200, (1200 - 3*200) / 2) = (200, 300)\nB. Intersection of inequalities 2 and 3: (200, (800 - 2*200) / 4) = (200, 200)\nC. Intersection of inequalities 1 and 4: ((1200 - 2*100) / 3, 100) = (400/3, 100)\nD. Intersection of inequalities 2 and 4: ((800 - 4*100) / 2, 100) = (300, 100)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\nA. P(200, 300) = 8*200 + 10*300 = 1600 + 3000 = 4600\nB. P(200, 200) = 8*200 + 10*200 = 1600 + 2000 = 3600\nC. P(400/3, 100) = 8*(400/3) + 10*100 = 3200/3 + 1000 = 4266.67 (approximately)\nD. P(300, 100) = 8*300 + 10*100 = 2400 + 1000 = 3400\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at point A, where the company produces 200 dolls of type A and 300 dolls of type B, and the maximum profit is $4600 per week."
