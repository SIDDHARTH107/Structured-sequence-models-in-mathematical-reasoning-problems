    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64-bits and a key size of 128-bits, and assume that the round function uses a substitution box (S-box) with an input of 6-bits and an output of 4-bits. If the cipher is designed to have 16 rounds, how many total S-boxes are required for the entire encryption process?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the block size is divided into two equal halves. Since the block size is 64-bits, each half is 32-bits. The round function operates on one half of the block (32-bits) and uses S-boxes to perform substitution.\n\nGiven that each S-box takes 6-bits as input and produces 4-bits as output, we can determine how many S-boxes are needed to process the 32-bit half-block:\n\n32-bits / 4-bits = 8 S-boxes\n\nSince the Feistel cipher has 16 rounds, and each round requires 8 S-boxes, the total number of S-boxes required for the entire encryption process is:\n\n16 rounds * 8 S-boxes/round = 128 S-boxes"
