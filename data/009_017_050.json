    "message_1": "A metal box with dimensions 1m x 1m x 1m is placed in a uniform electric field given by E = 4x i V/m, where i is the unit vector in the x-direction. Find the total charge enclosed in the box. (Assume the metal box has perfect conductivity and that any charges on the surface of the box do not affect the electric field inside the box.)",
    "message_2": "Since the metal box is a perfect conductor, the electric field inside the box will be zero. This is because the charges on the surface of the box will redistribute themselves to cancel out the external electric field inside the box.\n\nNow, let's find the total charge enclosed in the box. To do this, we can use Gauss's Law, which states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space (ε₀).\n\nΦ = Q_enclosed / ε₀\n\nThe electric flux (Φ) through a surface is given by the dot product of the electric field (E) and the area vector (A) of the surface.\n\nΦ = E • A\n\nSince the electric field is given by E = 4x i V/m, we can find the electric field at each face of the box. The electric field at the left face (x = 0) is E_left = 0 V/m, and the electric field at the right face (x = 1) is E_right = 4 V/m.\n\nThe area vector for each face is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude equal to the area of the face. For the left and right faces, the area vector is A_left = -1 m² j and A_right = 1 m² j, respectively.\n\nNow, we can find the electric flux through the left and right faces:\n\nΦ_left = E_left • A_left = 0 V/m * (-1 m²) j = 0 Vm\nΦ_right = E_right • A_right = 4 V/m * 1 m² j = 4 Vm\n\nThe total electric flux through the box is the sum of the fluxes through the left and right faces:\n\nΦ_total = Φ_left + Φ_right = 0 Vm + 4 Vm = 4 Vm\n\nNow, we can use Gauss's Law to find the total charge enclosed in the box:\n\nQ_enclosed = Φ_total * ε₀\n\nThe permittivity of free space (ε₀) is approximately 8.85 × 10⁻¹² C²/Nm². Plugging this value into the equation, we get:\n\nQ_enclosed = 4 Vm * 8.85 × 10⁻¹² C²/Nm² = 3.54 × 10⁻¹¹ C\n\nSo, the total charge enclosed in the metal box is approximately 3.54 × 10⁻¹¹ Coulombs."
