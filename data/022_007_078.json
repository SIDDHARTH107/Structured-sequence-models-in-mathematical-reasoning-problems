    "message_2": "To prove that $p(z)$ is constant, we will first show that $p(z)$ is a bounded entire function, and then apply Liouville's theorem.\n\nLet $p(z) = a_3z^3 + a_2z^2 + a_1z + a_0$, where $a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $a_3 \\neq 0$. Since $p(z)$ is of degree 3, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, it has exactly 3 roots, which we will denote as $z_1, z_2, z_3$. We can then factor $p(z)$ as follows:\n\n$p(z) = a_3(z - z_1)(z - z_2)(z - z_3)$.\n\nNow, consider the function $g(z) = \\frac{1}{p(z)}$. Since $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, $g(z)$ is an entire function. Moreover, for $|z| \\leq 1$, we have:\n\n$|g(z)| = \\frac{1}{|p(z)|} \\geq \\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nSince $g(z)$ is an entire function and is bounded on the closed unit disk, by the maximum modulus principle, $g(z)$ is also bounded on the entire complex plane. That is, there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $|g(z)| \\leq M$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$|p(z)| = \\frac{1}{|g(z)|} \\geq \\frac{1}{M}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThis shows that $p(z)$ is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, any bounded entire function must be constant. Therefore, $p(z)$ is constant."
