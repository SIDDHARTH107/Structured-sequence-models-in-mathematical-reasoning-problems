    "message_2": "To find the value of f(3i), we need to find a power series representation of f(z) that converges in a disk containing 3i. Since the given power series converges in the disk |z - 1| < 2, it converges in the disk centered at 1 with radius 2. However, 3i is not in this disk, so we need to find an analytic continuation of f(z) that converges in a disk containing 3i.\n\nLet's rewrite the function f(z) using the given power series:\n\nf(z) = ∑ a_n(z-1)^n = ∑ (n!/2^n)(z-1)^n\n\nNow, let's make a substitution to find an equivalent power series that converges in a disk containing 3i. Let w = z - 1, so z = w + 1. Then, we have:\n\nf(w + 1) = ∑ (n!/2^n)w^n\n\nThis power series converges in the disk |w| < 2, which corresponds to the disk |z - 1| < 2. Now, let's find a power series that converges in a disk containing 3i. Since 3i is 3 units away from 1, we can try a disk centered at 1 with radius 3. Let's make another substitution: let v = (z - 1)/3, so z = 3v + 1. Then, we have:\n\nf(3v + 1) = ∑ (n!/2^n)(3v)^n = ∑ (n!3^n/2^n)v^n\n\nThis power series converges in the disk |v| < 1, which corresponds to the disk |z - 1| < 3. This disk contains 3i, so we can use this power series to find the value of f(3i).\n\nNow, let's find f(3i) using the power series representation:\n\nf(3i) = f(3(1i) + 1) = ∑ (n!3^n/2^n)(1i)^n\n\nSince (1i)^n = i^n, we have:\n\nf(3i) = ∑ (n!3^n/2^n)i^n\n\nNow, we can plug in 3i for z:\n\nf(3i) = ∑ (n!3^n/2^n)i^n = i^0(0!3^0/2^0) + i^1(1!3^1/2^1) + i^2(2!3^2/2^2) + i^3(3!3^3/2^3) + ...\n\nNow, we can compute the first few terms of the series:\n\nf(3i) ≈ 1 - (3i)/2 - 9/4 + (27i)/8 + ...\n\nThis series converges to the value of f(3i). To get a more accurate value, we can compute more terms of the series. However, the exact value of f(3i) is given by the series:\n\nf(3i) = ∑ (n!3^n/2^n)i^n"
