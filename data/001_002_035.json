    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (m) of the line using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the given points (3, -2) and (5, 4):\n\nm = (4 - (-2)) / (5 - 3)\nm = (4 + 2) / 2\nm = 6 / 2\nm = 3\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either point to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (3, -2):\n\ny - (-2) = 3(x - 3)\ny + 2 = 3x - 9\n\nTo write the equation in the standard form, we can subtract 2 from both sides:\n\ny = 3x - 11\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (3, -2) and (5, 4) is y = 3x - 11."
