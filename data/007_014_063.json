    "message_2": "The next two perfect numbers after 28 are 496 and 8128.\n\nA perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The smallest perfect number is 6, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, and 3. The second smallest perfect number is 28, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14.\n\nThe next perfect number after 28 is 496, which has divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, and 248. The sum of these divisors is equal to 496.\n\nThe next perfect number after 496 is 8128, which has divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 127, 254, 508, 1016, 2032, and 4064. The sum of these divisors is equal to 8128."
