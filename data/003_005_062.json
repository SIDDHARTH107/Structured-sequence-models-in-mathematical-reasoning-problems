    "message_2": "To find the value of theta for which cos(theta) = 0.6, we can use the inverse cosine function, also known as arccos or cos^(-1).\n\ntheta = arccos(0.6)\n\nUsing a calculator or software that can compute inverse trigonometric functions, we find:\n\ntheta ≈ 53.13 degrees (in degrees)\nor\ntheta ≈ 0.927 radians (in radians)\n\nSo, the value of theta for which cos(theta) = 0.6 is approximately 53.13 degrees or 0.927 radians."
