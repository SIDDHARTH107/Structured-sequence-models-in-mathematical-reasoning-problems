    "message_2": "To compute the number of Turing machines with a tape alphabet of size 2, a state set of size 3, and a maximum tape length of 5, we need to consider the possible transitions for each state and tape symbol combination.\n\nThere are 3 states (let's call them A, B, and C) and 2 tape symbols (let's call them 0 and 1). For each state and tape symbol combination, there are 3 possible next states (A, B, or C), 2 possible tape symbols to write (0 or 1), and 2 possible tape head movements (left or right). Therefore, there are 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 possible transitions for each state and tape symbol combination.\n\nSince there are 3 states and 2 tape symbols, there are 3 * 2 = 6 state and tape symbol combinations. For each of these combinations, there are 12 possible transitions, so there are 12^6 = 2,985,984 possible Turing machines that can be constructed with a tape alphabet of size 2, a state set of size 3, and a maximum tape length of 5."
