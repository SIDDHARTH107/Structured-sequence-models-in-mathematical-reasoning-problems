    "message_2": "A Killing vector field is a vector field that generates a one-parameter group of isometries on the metric space. In other words, it is a vector field that preserves the metric under its flow. Mathematically, a vector field $X$ is a Killing vector field if the Lie derivative of the metric $g$ with respect to $X$ vanishes, i.e.,\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X g = 0$$\n\nFor the metric $g = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$, we can write this condition in terms of the covariant derivative as\n\n$$\\nabla_i X_j + \\nabla_j X_i = 0$$\n\nwhere $X = X^i \\partial_i$ and $\\nabla_i$ is the covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^i$. In Cartesian coordinates, the covariant derivative coincides with the partial derivative, so we have\n\n$$\\partial_i X_j + \\partial_j X_i = 0$$\n\nNow, we want to find all vector fields $X$ that satisfy this condition. We can write $X$ as\n\n$$X = X^1 \\partial_x + X^2 \\partial_y + X^3 \\partial_z$$\n\nPlugging this into the equation above, we get a system of six equations:\n\n$$\\partial_x X^1 = 0$$\n$$\\partial_y X^2 = 0$$\n$$\\partial_z X^3 = 0$$\n$$\\partial_x X^2 + \\partial_y X^1 = 0$$\n$$\\partial_x X^3 + \\partial_z X^1 = 0$$\n$$\\partial_y X^3 + \\partial_z X^2 = 0$$\n\nThe first three equations imply that $X^1$, $X^2$, and $X^3$ are constant along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. We can then write\n\n$$X^1 = a(x, y, z)$$\n$$X^2 = b(x, y, z)$$\n$$X^3 = c(x, y, z)$$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. The remaining three equations become\n\n$$\\partial_x b + \\partial_y a = 0$$\n$$\\partial_x c + \\partial_z a = 0$$\n$$\\partial_y c + \\partial_z b = 0$$\n\nThese equations are satisfied by the following vector fields:\n\n$$X_1 = -z \\partial_y + y \\partial_z$$\n$$X_2 = z \\partial_x - x \\partial_z$$\n$$X_3 = -y \\partial_x + x \\partial_y$$\n\nThese vector fields generate rotations around the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively. It is easy to verify that they satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$:\n\n$$[X_1, X_2] = X_3$$\n$$[X_2, X_3] = X_1$$\n$$[X_3, X_1] = X_2$$\n\nThus, we have found all the Killing vector fields of the metric $g = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$, and they form the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$."
