    "message_2": "To find the x- and y-intercepts of the absolute value equation |x + y| = 5, we need to consider two cases: when the expression inside the absolute value is positive and when it is negative.\n\nCase 1: x + y = 5\nTo find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x:\nx + 0 = 5\nx = 5\nSo, the x-intercept is (5, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y:\n0 + y = 5\ny = 5\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 5).\n\nCase 2: -(x + y) = 5\nSimplify the equation:\n-x - y = 5\n\nTo find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x:\n-x - 0 = 5\n-x = 5\nx = -5\nSo, the x-intercept is (-5, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y:\n-0 - y = 5\n-y = 5\ny = -5\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -5).\n\nIn conclusion, the x- and y-intercepts of the absolute value equation |x + y| = 5 are (5, 0), (0, 5), (-5, 0), and (0, -5)."
