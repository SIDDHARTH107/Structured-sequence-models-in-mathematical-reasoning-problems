    "message_2": "To encrypt a message using RSA, we use the formula:\n\nc = m^e mod N\n\nGiven the public key (e=5, N=77) and the message m = 13, we can compute the ciphertext as follows:\n\nc = 13^5 mod 77\nc = 371293 mod 77\nc = 62\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is 62.\n\nNow, to decrypt the received ciphertext c = 30 using the private key (d=29, N=77), we use the formula:\n\nm = c^d mod N\n\nm = 30^29 mod 77\nm = 205891132094649 mod 77\nm = 10\n\nSo, the original message before encryption is 10."
