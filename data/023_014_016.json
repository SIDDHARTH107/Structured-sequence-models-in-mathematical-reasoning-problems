    "message_2": "To find the momentum probability distribution for the particle, we need to calculate the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[f(x) * e^(-ikx) dx]\n\nIn our case, f(x) = ψ(x) = Ae^(-x^2 / b^2). So, we need to calculate the Fourier transform of this function:\n\nΦ(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[Ae^(-x^2 / b^2) * e^(-ikx) dx]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫[e^(-ax^2) dx] = √(π/a)\n\nNow, we can substitute u = x/b and du = dx/b, so the integral becomes:\n\nΦ(k) = (A/√(2π)) ∫[e^(-u^2) * e^(-ikbu) du]\n\nNow, we can use the Gaussian integral formula to solve this integral:\n\nΦ(k) = (A/√(2π)) * √(π) * e^(-k^2 * b^2 / 4)\n\nNow, we need to find the momentum probability distribution, which is given by the square of the absolute value of the Fourier transform:\n\nP(k) = |Φ(k)|^2 = (A^2 / (2π)) * π * e^(-k^2 * b^2 / 2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values of L = 5 and b = 1:\n\nP(k) = (A^2 / (2π)) * π * e^(-k^2 / 2)\n\nTo find the constant A, we can use the normalization condition for the wave function:\n\n∫[|ψ(x)|^2 dx] = 1\n\n(A^2 / b) * √(π) = 1\n\nA^2 = b / √(π)\n\nSince b = 1, we have:\n\nA^2 = 1 / √(π)\n\nNow, we can plug this value of A^2 back into the momentum probability distribution:\n\nP(k) = (1 / (2π)) * π * e^(-k^2 / 2)\n\nP(k) = (1 / 2) * e^(-k^2 / 2)\n\nThis is the momentum probability distribution for the particle with the given wave function and parameters."
