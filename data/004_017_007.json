    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we will use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)/3\ndy/dx = (3/2) * (x^(1/2))/3 = x^(1/2)/2\n\nNow, we need to find (dy/dx)^2:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = (x^(1/2)/2)^2 = x/4\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 5] √(1 + x/4) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu^2 = 1 + x/4\n2u du = dx/4\ndx = 8u du\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[u(0), u(5)] 8u^2 du\n\nWe need to find the limits of integration in terms of u:\n\nu^2 = 1 + 0/4\nu(0) = 1\n\nu^2 = 1 + 5/4\nu(5) = √(9/4) = 3/2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral with the new limits:\n\nL = ∫[1, 3/2] 8u^2 du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (8/3)u^3 | [1, 3/2]\nL = (8/3)((3/2)^3 - 1^3)\nL = (8/3)(27/8 - 1)\nL = (8/3)(19/8)\nL = 19/3\n\nSo, the exact length of the curve is 19/3."
