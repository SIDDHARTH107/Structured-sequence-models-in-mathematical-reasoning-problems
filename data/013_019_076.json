    "message_1": "Here's a possible question for a math student to solve related to Cheap Talk in Game theory:\n\nTwo friends, Andy and Bob, are about to take a multiple choice test with 10 questions. There are three possible answers for each question (A, B, or C), but only one of them is correct. Before the test, they exchange some information about the topics they studied and the strategies they plan to use during the test. Andy says that he will always choose A if he doesn't know the answer and B otherwise. Bob says that he will always choose B if he doesn't know the answer and C otherwise.\n\nAssuming that both friends are rational and honest, what is the probability that they will both get the same score on the test, given that they answer each question independently and randomly, but following their declared strategies?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts. There are three possible scenarios for each question:\n\n1. Both Andy and Bob know the answer.\n2. Only one of them knows the answer.\n3. Neither of them knows the answer.\n\nLet P(K) be the probability that a student knows the answer to a question. Since they answer each question independently, the probabilities for each scenario are:\n\n1. P(both know) = P(K) * P(K) = P(K)^2\n2. P(only one knows) = P(K) * (1 - P(K)) + (1 - P(K)) * P(K) = 2 * P(K) * (1 - P(K))\n3. P(neither knows) = (1 - P(K)) * (1 - P(K)) = (1 - P(K))^2\n\nNow, let's consider the probability that they both get the same answer for each scenario:\n\n1. If both know the answer, they will both choose the correct answer, so the probability of getting the same answer is 1.\n2. If only one of them knows the answer, they will choose different answers, so the probability of getting the same answer is 0.\n3. If neither of them knows the answer, Andy will choose A and Bob will choose B. The probability of getting the same answer is 1/3 (when the correct answer is C).\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability that they both get the same answer for a single question:\n\nP(same answer) = P(both know) * 1 + P(only one knows) * 0 + P(neither knows) * 1/3\nP(same answer) = P(K)^2 + (1 - P(K))^2 * 1/3\n\nSince there are 10 questions, the probability that they both get the same score on the test is the probability that they get the same answer for all 10 questions:\n\nP(same score) = [P(K)^2 + (1 - P(K))^2 * 1/3]^10\n\nThis is the general formula for the probability that Andy and Bob will both get the same score on the test, given their declared strategies and the probability P(K) that they know the answer to a question."
