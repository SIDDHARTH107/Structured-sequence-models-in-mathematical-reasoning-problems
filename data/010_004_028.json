    "message_2": "1. The interval [0,1]:\n\nThe interval [0,1] is compact. This is because it is both closed and bounded in the metric space (ℝ, d). It is closed because it contains all its limit points, and it is bounded because there exists a real number M (in this case, M=1) such that for all x, y in [0,1], d(x, y) ≤ M. According to the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of ℝ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded, so [0,1] is compact.\n\n2. The set (0,1]:\n\nThe set (0,1] is not compact. Although it is bounded, it is not closed, as it does not contain one of its limit points, which is 0. Since it is not both closed and bounded, it is not compact.\n\n3. The set of integers ℤ:\n\nThe set of integers ℤ is not compact. Although it is closed (it contains all its limit points), it is not bounded. There is no real number M such that for all x, y in ℤ, d(x, y) ≤ M, as the integers extend infinitely in both positive and negative directions. Since it is not both closed and bounded, it is not compact.\n\n4. The set of even integers 2ℤ:\n\nThe set of even integers 2ℤ is not compact. Similar to the set of integers ℤ, it is closed (it contains all its limit points) but not bounded. There is no real number M such that for all x, y in 2ℤ, d(x, y) ≤ M, as the even integers also extend infinitely in both positive and negative directions. Since it is not both closed and bounded, it is not compact."
