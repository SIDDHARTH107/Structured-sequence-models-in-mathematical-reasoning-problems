    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |sin x| on the interval [0, 2π], we first need to determine if the function is even or odd. Since |sin x| is an even function, we only need to compute the Fourier cosine series.\n\nThe Fourier cosine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a_0)/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients, which can be calculated as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nFor f(x) = |sin x|, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[|sin x|]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nSince |sin x| is positive in [0, π] and negative in [π, 2π], we can split the integral:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[sin x]dx from 0 to π + ∫[-sin x]dx from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [-cos x | from 0 to π + cos x | from π to 2π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-cos π + cos 0) + (cos 2π - cos π)]\na_0 = (1/π) * [2 + 1]\na_0 = 3/π\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[|sin x| * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nAgain, we split the integral:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[sin x * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to π + ∫[-sin x * cos(nx)]dx from π to 2π]\n\nTo solve these integrals, we can use the product-to-sum formula:\n\nsin x * cos(nx) = (1/2) * [sin((n-1)x) - sin((n+1)x)]\n\nNow, we have:\n\na_n = (1/2π) * [∫[sin((n-1)x) - sin((n+1)x)]dx from 0 to π + ∫[-sin((n-1)x) + sin((n+1)x)]dx from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1/2π) * [(1/(n-1)) * (-cos((n-1)x)) - (1/(n+1)) * cos((n+1)x) | from 0 to π + (1/(n-1)) * cos((n-1)x) - (1/(n+1)) * (-cos((n+1)x)) | from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1/2π) * [(1/(n-1)) * (-cos((n-1)π) + cos(0)) - (1/(n+1)) * (cos((n+1)π) - cos(0)) + (1/(n-1)) * (cos((n-1)2π) - cos((n-1)π)) - (1/(n+1)) * (-cos((n+1)2π) + cos((n+1)π))]\n\nFor odd n, cos(nπ) = -1 and for even n, cos(nπ) = 1. So, we can simplify the expression:\n\na_n = (1/2π) * [(1/(n-1)) * (2) - (1/(n+1)) * (-2) + (1/(n-1)) * (-2) - (1/(n+1)) * (2)]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/(n-1) - 1/(n+1)) * 2]\n\na_n = (4/π) * [(n+1 - n + 1) / ((n-1)(n+1))]\n\na_n = (8/π) * [1 / (n^2 - 1)]\n\nSo, the Fourier cosine series for f(x) = |sin x| on the interval [0, 2π] is:\n\nf(x) = (3/π)/2 + Σ[(8/π) * (1 / (n^2 - 1)) * cos(nx)]"
