    "message_2": "To find the resulting ciphertext after 3 rounds of Feistel cipher, we need to follow the Feistel structure process. Let's denote the plaintext as P, the encryption key as K, and the ciphertext as C. We'll also denote the left and right halves of the plaintext as L0 and R0, respectively.\n\n1. Split the plaintext into two equal halves:\n   L0 = 11001100\n   R0 = 11001100\n\n2. Perform the first round of Feistel cipher:\n   L1 = R0\n   R1 = L0 XOR f(R0, K)\n   Here, f is the round function, which we don't have information about. However, we can denote the result of the round function as f1.\n   L1 = 11001100\n   R1 = 11001100 XOR f1\n\n3. Perform the second round of Feistel cipher:\n   L2 = R1\n   R2 = L1 XOR f(R1, K)\n   Here, we can denote the result of the round function as f2.\n   L2 = 11001100 XOR f1\n   R2 = 11001100 XOR f2\n\n4. Perform the third round of Feistel cipher:\n   L3 = R2\n   R3 = L2 XOR f(R2, K)\n   Here, we can denote the result of the round function as f3.\n   L3 = 11001100 XOR f2\n   R3 = (11001100 XOR f1) XOR f3\n\n5. Combine L3 and R3 to get the ciphertext:\n   C = L3 || R3\n   C = (11001100 XOR f2) || ((11001100 XOR f1) XOR f3)\n\nWithout knowing the round function f, we cannot determine the exact ciphertext. However, we can represent the ciphertext in terms of the unknown round function outputs f1, f2, and f3 as shown above."
