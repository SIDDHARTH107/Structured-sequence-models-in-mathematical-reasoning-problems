    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function on the interval, we need to first find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nLet's find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 4)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 6x = 0\nx(3x - 6) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points:\nx = 0 and x = 2\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval [-1, 4]:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 + 4 = -1 - 3 + 4 = 0\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 3(0)^2 + 4 = 4\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 4 = 8 - 12 + 4 = 0\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 3(4)^2 + 4 = 64 - 48 + 4 = 20\n\nComparing these values, we find that the maximum value of the function on the interval [-1, 4] is 20, which occurs at x = 4, and the minimum value of the function on the interval is 0, which occurs at x = -1 and x = 2."
