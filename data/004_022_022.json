    "message_1": "A cylindrical soup can has a volume of 500cm³. The metal used to make the can costs $0.05/cm² for the top and bottom, and $0.04/cm² for the sides. Find the dimensions of the can that minimize the cost of the metal used. (Assume the can has a top and a bottom of equal size and the sides are straight.)",
    "message_2": "Let r be the radius of the base of the cylinder and h be its height. The volume of the cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h. Since the volume is 500 cm³, we have:\n\nπr²h = 500\n\nThe surface area of the top and bottom of the cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πr², and the surface area of the sides is given by the formula A = 2πrh. The total cost of the metal used is given by the formula:\n\nC = 0.05(2πr²) + 0.04(2πrh)\n\nWe want to minimize the cost C with respect to the dimensions r and h. To do this, we will first eliminate one of the variables by solving the volume equation for h:\n\nh = 500 / (πr²)\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the cost equation:\n\nC = 0.05(2πr²) + 0.04(2πr(500 / (πr²)))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nC = 0.1πr² + 0.08π(500 / r)\n\nNow we will find the critical points by taking the derivative of C with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = 0.2πr - 0.08π(500 / r²)\n\nSet dC/dr = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0.2πr = 0.08π(500 / r²)\n\nDivide both sides by π:\n\n0.2r = 0.08(500 / r²)\n\nMultiply both sides by r²:\n\n0.2r³ = 0.08 * 500\n\nDivide both sides by 0.2:\n\nr³ = 200\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nr = (200)^(1/3)\n\nr ≈ 5.85 cm\n\nNow find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 500 / (π(5.85)²)\n\nh ≈ 4.63 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the can that minimize the cost of the metal used are approximately r = 5.85 cm and h = 4.63 cm."
