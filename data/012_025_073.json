    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In order to determine if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in graph G with 8 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3, we can use the necessary conditions for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nOne necessary condition for a graph to have a Hamiltonian cycle is that it must be connected, meaning there is a path between every pair of vertices. Since each vertex in G has a degree of 3, the graph is likely to be connected.\n\nAnother necessary condition is given by Dirac's theorem, which states that a Hamiltonian cycle exists in a graph G with n vertices if the degree of each vertex is at least n/2. In our case, n = 8, so n/2 = 4. However, the degree of each vertex in G is 3, which is less than 4. Therefore, Dirac's theorem does not guarantee the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in G.\n\nSince the necessary conditions for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle are not met, we cannot find a Hamiltonian cycle in G."
