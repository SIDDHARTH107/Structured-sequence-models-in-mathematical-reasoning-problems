    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of turns in the graph of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2, we need to analyze its first and second derivatives.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x + 12\n\nThe maximum number of turns in the graph of a function occurs when the second derivative changes sign. To find the points where the second derivative changes sign, we need to find its critical points, which are the points where f''(x) = 0 or is undefined.\n\nIn this case, f''(x) is a quadratic function, and it is never undefined. So, we need to find the points where f''(x) = 0:\n\n12x^2 - 24x + 12 = 0\n\nDivide by 12:\nx^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\n\nFactor:\n(x - 1)(x - 1) = 0\n\nThe only solution is x = 1.\n\nSince there is only one critical point, the second derivative changes sign at most once. Therefore, the maximum number of turns in the graph of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 is 1."
