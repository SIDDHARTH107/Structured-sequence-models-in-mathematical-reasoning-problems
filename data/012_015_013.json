    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 8 vertices, so the graph must have at least 8-1 = 7 edges to be connected. Since our graph has 12 edges, it is possible that the graph is connected.\n\nHowever, having more than n-1 edges does not guarantee that the graph is connected. We need more information to definitively determine if the graph is connected or not.\n\nIf the graph is connected, we can find the diameter by calculating the longest shortest path between any two vertices. The diameter is the maximum eccentricity of the vertices in the graph. The eccentricity of a vertex is the greatest distance between it and any other vertex.\n\nWithout more information about the specific connections between vertices, we cannot determine the diameter of the graph."
