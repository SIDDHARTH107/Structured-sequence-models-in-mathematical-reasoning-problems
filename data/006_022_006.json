    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many girls and boys are in the school.\n\nGirls: 1200 * 60% = 720\nBoys: 1200 - 720 = 480\n\nNow, let's find out how many girls and boys passed their final math exams.\n\nGirls who passed: 720 * 80% = 576\nBoys who passed: 480 * 70% = 336\n\nNow, let's find out the total number of students who passed their final math exams.\n\nTotal students who passed: 576 (girls) + 336 (boys) = 912\n\nNow, let's find the probability that a randomly selected student from the school passed their final math exam.\n\nProbability = (Total students who passed) / (Total students)\n\nProbability = 912 / 1200 = 0.76 or 76%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from the school passed their final math exam is 76%."
