    "message_1": "A 20-meter tall building is located 25 meters away from you. You measure the angle of elevation of the top of the building to be 42 degrees. What is the height of the building to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "The problem statement says that the building is already 20 meters tall. However, if you want to verify the height of the building using the angle of elevation, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry.\n\nLet's denote the height of the building as h and the distance from you to the building as d. In this case, d = 25 meters, and the angle of elevation is 42 degrees.\n\nUsing the tangent function, we have:\n\ntan(angle) = h / d\n\ntan(42) = h / 25\n\nTo find the height, h, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nh = 25 * tan(42)\n\nNow, we can calculate the height:\n\nh ≈ 25 * tan(42) ≈ 25 * 0.9004 ≈ 22.51 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 23 meters to the nearest meter."
