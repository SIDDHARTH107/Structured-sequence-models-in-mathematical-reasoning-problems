    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given function f(x) = 5sin(3x) - 2cos(3x), we first need to rewrite it in the standard form of a sinusoidal function: A*sin(Bx + C) or A*cos(Bx + C).\n\nTo do this, we can use the angle addition identity for sine and cosine functions:\n\nsin(A - B) = sin(A)cos(B) - cos(A)sin(B)\n\nLet A = 3x and B = α, then we have:\n\nsin(3x - α) = sin(3x)cos(α) - cos(3x)sin(α)\n\nNow, we want to find α such that:\n\n5sin(3x) - 2cos(3x) = R*sin(3x - α)\n\nwhere R is the amplitude.\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\n5 = R*cos(α) and -2 = -R*sin(α)\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean identity:\n\nR^2 = (R*cos(α))^2 + (R*sin(α))^2\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\nR^2 = 5^2 + (-2)^2\nR^2 = 25 + 4\nR^2 = 29\nR = sqrt(29)\n\nSo the amplitude is R = sqrt(29).\n\nNow, let's find α:\n\ncos(α) = 5/sqrt(29)\nsin(α) = -2/sqrt(29)\n\nWe can use the arctangent function to find α:\n\ntan(α) = sin(α)/cos(α) = -2/5\n\nα = arctan(-2/5)\n\nNow, we have the function in the standard form:\n\nf(x) = sqrt(29)*sin(3x - arctan(-2/5))\n\nThe period of the function is determined by the coefficient of x inside the sine function, which is 3 in this case. The period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π/B\n\nIn our case, B = 3, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = 2π/3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function is sqrt(29) and the period is 2π/3."
