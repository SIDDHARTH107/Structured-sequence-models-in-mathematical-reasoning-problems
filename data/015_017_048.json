    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + a * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = a * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = b - c / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2) and a, b, and c are parameters.\n\nTo find the maximum number of attractors present in the chaotic dynamics of the Ikeda map for the given parameters a=0.9184 and b=0.7754, we need to analyze the behavior of the map for different initial conditions and identify the basins of attraction.\n\nHowever, finding the exact number of attractors for a specific set of parameters in a chaotic map is a complex task that usually requires numerical simulations and advanced computational tools. It is not possible to provide an exact number of attractors without performing such simulations.\n\nIn general, the Ikeda map can exhibit a wide range of dynamical behaviors, including periodic orbits, quasiperiodic orbits, and chaotic attractors, depending on the choice of parameters. The number of attractors can vary significantly depending on the specific parameter values and the initial conditions."
