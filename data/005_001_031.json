    "message_1": "A coffee shop owner claims that the average weight of a bag of coffee beans in their shop is 500 grams. A math student wants to test this claim. They randomly select 30 bags of coffee beans and find out that the average weight is 480 grams with a standard deviation of 20 grams. Can the student reject the coffee shop owner's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the coffee shop owner's claim, we can use a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average weight of a bag of coffee beans is 500 grams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average weight is not 500 grams.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (480 - 500) / (20 / sqrt(30))\n\nt = -20 / (20 / sqrt(30))\n\nt = -20 / (20 / 5.48)\n\nt = -20 / 3.65\n\nt ≈ -5.48\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance with 29 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the critical t-value is approximately ±2.045.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-5.48) is less than the critical t-value (-2.045), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1). Therefore, the student can reject the coffee shop owner's claim that the average weight of a bag of coffee beans is 500 grams at a 5% level of significance."
