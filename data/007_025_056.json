    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where a is Alice's secret key.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret key.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as S_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as S_B = A^b mod p.\n\nIf the protocol works correctly, S_A and S_B should be equal, and that will be the shared secret key.\n\nLet's compute the values:\n\n1. A = 2^5 mod 13 = 32 mod 13 = 6\n2. B = 2^8 mod 13 = 256 mod 13 = 11\n3. S_A = 11^5 mod 13 = 161051 mod 13 = 3\n4. S_B = 6^8 mod 13 = 1679616 mod 13 = 3\n\nSince S_A and S_B are equal, the shared secret key is 3. Alice and Bob will use this key for encryption and decryption."
