    "message_1": "A company has two factories, F1 and F2, both of which can produce Product X and Product Y. Factory F1 can produce X in 2 hours and Y in 3 hours. Factory F2 can produce X in 4 hours and Y in 2 hours. The company needs to produce 200 units of X and 150 units of Y. Determine the optimal production schedule, showing how many units of each product should be produced in each factory, to minimize the total production time.",
    "message_2": "Let x1 be the number of units of Product X produced by Factory F1 and y1 be the number of units of Product Y produced by Factory F1. Similarly, let x2 be the number of units of Product X produced by Factory F2 and y2 be the number of units of Product Y produced by Factory F2.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\nx1 + x2 = 200 (total units of Product X)\ny1 + y2 = 150 (total units of Product Y)\n\nThe total production time T can be expressed as:\n\nT = 2x1 + 3y1 + 4x2 + 2y2\n\nWe want to minimize T subject to the constraints. We can solve this problem using the method of linear programming.\n\nFirst, we can express x2 and y2 in terms of x1 and y1 using the constraints:\n\nx2 = 200 - x1\ny2 = 150 - y1\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation for T:\n\nT = 2x1 + 3y1 + 4(200 - x1) + 2(150 - y1)\nT = 2x1 + 3y1 + 800 - 4x1 + 300 - 2y1\nT = -2x1 + y1 + 1100\n\nNow we need to find the minimum value of T. Since the coefficients of x1 and y1 are negative, the minimum value of T will occur at the intersection of the constraint equations.\n\nx1 + x2 = 200\ny1 + y2 = 150\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nx1 = 100\ny1 = 50\n\nSubstituting these values back into the expressions for x2 and y2:\n\nx2 = 200 - x1 = 200 - 100 = 100\ny2 = 150 - y1 = 150 - 50 = 100\n\nSo the optimal production schedule is:\n\nFactory F1: Produce 100 units of Product X and 50 units of Product Y\nFactory F2: Produce 100 units of Product X and 100 units of Product Y\n\nThe minimum total production time can be calculated by substituting these values into the equation for T:\n\nT = -2(100) + 50 + 1100 = 950 hours"
