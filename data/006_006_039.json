    "message_1": "A basketball player has a free throw percentage of 80%. If he takes 5 free throws, what is the probability that he will make exactly 4 of those free throws?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of making exactly k free throws out of n attempts\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (making a free throw)\n- q is the probability of failure (missing a free throw)\n- n is the number of attempts (5 free throws in this case)\n- k is the number of successful attempts (4 free throws made in this case)\n\nIn this problem:\n- n = 5 (5 free throws)\n- k = 4 (4 free throws made)\n- p = 0.8 (80% success rate)\n- q = 1 - p = 0.2 (20% failure rate)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = (5C4) * (0.8^4) * (0.2^(5-4))\n\nFirst, we need to find 5C4, which is the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 attempts:\n\n5C4 = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5! / (4! * 1!) = 5\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = 5 * (0.8^4) * (0.2^1)\n\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.4096 * 0.2\n\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.08192\n\nP(X = 4) â‰ˆ 0.4096\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player will make exactly 4 out of 5 free throws is approximately 40.96%."
