    "message_1": "A new coffee shop has opened in town and you want to determine whether the advertisement played a role in its success. You randomly poll 100 customers and ask whether they visited the shop because of the advertisement. 60 people responded yes. What is the relative frequency of customers who visited the coffee shop because of the advertisement?",
    "message_2": "The relative frequency of customers who visited the coffee shop because of the advertisement can be calculated by dividing the number of people who responded yes by the total number of people polled.\n\nRelative frequency = (Number of people who responded yes) / (Total number of people polled)\n\nRelative frequency = 60 / 100\n\nRelative frequency = 0.6\n\nSo, the relative frequency of customers who visited the coffee shop because of the advertisement is 0.6 or 60%."
