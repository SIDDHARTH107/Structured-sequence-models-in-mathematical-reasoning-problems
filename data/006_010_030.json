    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a group of 500 people, at least 25% will be affected by a certain disease, if the overall prevalence of the disease in the general population is 5%? Note: assume that the probability of a person being affected is independent of other people in the group.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (people affected by the disease) in n trials (people in the group)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (5% or 0.05 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (500 people in the group)\n- k is the number of successes (we want at least 25% of 500, which is 125 people)\n\nHowever, since we want the probability of at least 25% of the group being affected, we need to calculate the probability of 125 or more people being affected. To do this, we can find the complement probability (the probability of fewer than 125 people being affected) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 124:\n\nP(X < 125) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 124\n\nThen, we can find the complement probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 125) = 1 - P(X < 125)\n\nLet's calculate P(X < 125):\n\nP(X < 125) = Σ C(500, k) * 0.05^k * 0.95^(500-k) for k = 0 to 124\n\nThis calculation involves a large number of terms and is best done using a computer or calculator with statistical functions. Using a calculator or software, we get:\n\nP(X < 125) ≈ 0.9824\n\nNow, we can find the complement probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 125) = 1 - P(X < 125) = 1 - 0.9824 ≈ 0.0176\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25% of the group (125 or more people) will be affected by the disease is approximately 1.76%."
