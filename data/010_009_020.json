    "message_2": "To calculate the number of faces in the triangulation, we can use Euler's formula for polyhedra:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. In this case, we have:\n\nV = 5 (given)\nE = 10 (given)\n\nWe need to solve for F:\n\n5 - 10 + F = 2\nF = 2 - 5 + 10\nF = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 faces in the triangulation."
