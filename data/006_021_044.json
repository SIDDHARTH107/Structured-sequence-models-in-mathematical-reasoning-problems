    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a tornado occurring in a particular region, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, tornadoes) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x events occurring in the given interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events per interval (in this case, 1 tornado every 5 years)\n- x is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 1 tornado)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- x! is the factorial of x (the product of all positive integers up to x)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of a tornado occurring in a 1-year interval, so we will use λ = 1/5 (since there is 1 tornado every 5 years on average) and x = 1 (since we want to find the probability of 1 tornado occurring).\n\nP(1) = (e^(-1/5) * (1/5)^1) / 1!\n\nP(1) = (0.81873 * 0.2) / 1\n\nP(1) ≈ 0.16375\n\nSo, the probability of a tornado occurring in a particular region in a 1-year interval, given that historical data indicates an average of 1 tornado every 5 years, is approximately 16.375%."
