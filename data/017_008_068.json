If G has more than one element of order 2, prove that G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8. Finally, if G has no element of order 2, prove that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.",
    "message_2": "Case 1: G has exactly one element of order 2.\nLet e be the identity element of G and let a be the unique element of order 2. Since G has order 8, there are 6 remaining elements. Let b be one of these elements. Since the order of b cannot be 2 (as a is the unique element of order 2), the order of b must be 4 or 8. If the order of b is 8, then G is cyclic, which contradicts the assumption that G has an element of order 2. Therefore, the order of b must be 4.\n\nNow consider the elements ab, ba, b^2, b^3. None of these can be equal to a, since a has order 2 and all of these have order 4. None of these can be equal to b, since b has order 4 and all of these have order 2. Therefore, these four elements are distinct and form a subgroup of G of order 4. Since G has order 8, this subgroup together with the elements e and a form the entire group G.\n\nThe group G is now completely determined by the relations a^2 = e, b^4 = e, and ba = ab^3. This is precisely the presentation of the dihedral group D4, so G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nCase 2: G has more than one element of order 2.\nLet a and b be distinct elements of order 2 in G. Consider the subgroup H generated by a and b. Since a and b have order 2, the elements e, a, b, and ab are all in H. Moreover, since a and b are distinct, these four elements are distinct. Therefore, H has order at least 4.\n\nNow, since G has order 8, the order of H must divide 8. Thus, the order of H must be 4 or 8. If the order of H is 8, then G = H, and G has at least four elements of order 2 (e, a, b, and ab). This is precisely the quaternion group Q8, so G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nCase 3: G has no element of order 2.\nIn this case, every non-identity element of G must have order 4 or 8. Let a be any non-identity element of G. If a has order 8, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C8. If a has order 4, let b be another non-identity element of G not equal to a or a^3. Then b must have order 8, since G has no element of order 2. In this case, G is again cyclic and isomorphic to C8."
