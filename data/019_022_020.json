    "message_1": "A company can invest in Project A or Project B. The success of Project A has a probability of 0.6 while the success of Project B has a probability of 0.8. If Project A succeeds, the company will make a profit of $50,000. If Project B succeeds, the company will make a profit of $70,000. However, both projects have a 20% chance of failure. What project should the company invest in to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine which project the company should invest in, we need to calculate the expected profit for each project. The expected profit is calculated by multiplying the probability of success by the profit if the project succeeds.\n\nExpected Profit for Project A:\nProbability of success (0.6) * Profit if successful ($50,000) = 0.6 * $50,000 = $30,000\n\nExpected Profit for Project B:\nProbability of success (0.8) * Profit if successful ($70,000) = 0.8 * $70,000 = $56,000\n\nComparing the expected profits, Project B has a higher expected profit ($56,000) than Project A ($30,000). Therefore, the company should invest in Project B to maximize their expected profit."
