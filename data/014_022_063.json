    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted the following Playfair cipher message: \"SYDLMXMWINAO\". Using cryptanalysis, deduce the plaintext message. The key used for encryption is \"MATHEMATICS\".",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher message, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key \"MATHEMATICS\". We remove duplicate letters from the key and fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding \"J\" since \"I\" and \"J\" are combined in the matrix).\n\nThe matrix will look like this:\n\nM A T H E\nI C S B D\nF G K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we will decrypt the ciphertext \"SYDLMXMWINAO\" using the Playfair matrix. We break the ciphertext into digraphs: SY DL MX MW IN AO.\n\n1. SY: S is in row 1, column 2 and Y is in row 4, column 4. Since they are not in the same row or column, we take the letters in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle formed by the two letters: C (row 1, column 4) and R (row 4, column 2). So, SY decrypts to CR.\n\n2. DL: D is in row 1, column 5 and L is in row 2, column 4. They form a rectangle, so we take the letters in the same row but at the other corner: E (row 1, column 4) and K (row 2, column 5). So, DL decrypts to EK.\n\n3. MX: M is in row 0, column 0 and X is in row 4, column 3. They form a rectangle, so we take the letters in the same row but at the other corner: A (row 0, column 3) and W (row 4, column 0). So, MX decrypts to AW.\n\n4. MW: M is in row 0, column 0 and W is in row 4, column 0. They are in the same column, so we take the letters above them in the same column: V (row 3, column 0) and I (row 0, column 0). So, MW decrypts to VI.\n\n5. IN: I is in row 1, column 0 and N is in row 2, column 5. They form a rectangle, so we take the letters in the same row but at the other corner: S (row 1, column 5) and G (row 2, column 0). So, IN decrypts to SG.\n\n6. AO: A is in row 0, column 1 and O is in row 3, column 0. They form a rectangle, so we take the letters in the same row but at the other corner: T (row 0, column 0) and P (row 3, column 1). So, AO decrypts to TP.\n\nPutting the decrypted digraphs together, we get the plaintext message: \"CREKAWVISGTP\"."
