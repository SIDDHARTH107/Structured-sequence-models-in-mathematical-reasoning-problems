    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite to side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, let's denote the sides adjacent to the 60-degree angle as a and b, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle as c. So, a = 3 cm, b = 5 cm, and C = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can apply the Law of Cosines:\n\nc² = 3² + 5² - 2 * 3 * 5 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 9 + 25 - 30 * (1/2)\nc² = 34 - 15\nc² = 19\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √19 ≈ 4.36 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c = 3 + 5 + 4.36 ≈ 12.36 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 12.36 cm."
