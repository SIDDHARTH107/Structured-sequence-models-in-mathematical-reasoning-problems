    "message_2": "To show that X is path-connected, we need to show that for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nLet x, y ∈ X, where x and y are real numbers in the closed interval [0, 1]. Define the function f: [0, 1] → X as follows:\n\nf(t) = (1 - t)x + ty\n\nThis function is a continuous function, as it is a linear combination of continuous functions (x and y are constants). Moreover, f(0) = (1 - 0)x + 0y = x and f(1) = (1 - 1)x + 1y = y. Thus, f is a continuous function connecting x and y in X.\n\nSince we have shown that there exists a continuous function connecting any two points in X, we can conclude that X is path-connected."
