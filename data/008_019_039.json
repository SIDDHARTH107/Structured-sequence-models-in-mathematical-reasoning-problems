    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the first and second equations. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by -1 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(2)(x + 2y + 3z) = (2)(13)\n(-1)(2x - y + 4z) = (-1)(-1)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n2x + 4y + 6z = 26\n-2x + y - 4z = 1\n\nNow, add the two equations to eliminate y:\n\n(2x + 4y + 6z) + (-2x + y - 4z) = 26 + 1\n2x - 2x + 4y + y + 6z - 4z = 27\n5y + 2z = 27 (1)\n\nNext, let's eliminate y from the first and third equations. Multiply the first equation by -2 and the third equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(-2)(x + 2y + 3z) = (-2)(13)\n(1)(3x + 2y + z) = (1)(10)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n-2x - 4y - 6z = -26\n3x + 2y + z = 10\n\nNow, add the two equations to eliminate y:\n\n(-2x - 4y - 6z) + (3x + 2y + z) = -26 + 10\n-2x + 3x - 4y + 2y - 6z + z = -16\nx - 5z = -16 (2)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables (z and y):\n\n5y + 2z = 27 (1)\nx - 5z = -16 (2)\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express x in terms of z:\n\nx = 5z - 16\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into equation (1):\n\n5y + 2z = 27\n5y + 2z = 5(5z - 16) + 2z\n5y = 25z - 80 - 2z\n5y = 23z - 80\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\ny = (23/5)z - 16\n\nNow, we have expressions for x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = 5z - 16\ny = (23/5)z - 16\n\nSince the problem asks for a solution over the complex numbers, we can't simplify further without additional information. Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is given by:\n\nx = 5z - 16\ny = (23/5)z - 16\nwhere z is any complex number."
