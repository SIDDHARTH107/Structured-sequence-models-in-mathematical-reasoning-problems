    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is planar or not, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have V = 8 vertices and E = 10 edges. We can rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - 8 + 10\nF = 4\n\nNow, we need to check if this graph satisfies the inequality derived from the Handshaking lemma for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for V and E:\n\n10 ≤ 3(8) - 6\n10 ≤ 24 - 6\n10 ≤ 18\n\nThe inequality holds true, so the graph could be planar. However, this is not a definitive proof, as there might still be a non-planar subgraph within the graph. To be sure, we can check for the presence of the Kuratowski's subgraphs (K5 and K3,3) in the graph.\n\nSince the graph has only 8 vertices, it cannot contain the complete graph K5 as a subgraph. Now we need to check for the bipartite graph K3,3. A K3,3 graph has 6 vertices and 9 edges. Our graph has 8 vertices and 10 edges, so it is possible that it contains a K3,3 subgraph.\n\nHowever, a K3,3 graph has each vertex of degree 3, and the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a K3,3 graph is 18. In our graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2E = 2(10) = 20. This means that if our graph contains a K3,3 subgraph, there must be at least two vertices with a degree greater than 3. If we can show that this is not the case, then our graph cannot contain a K3,3 subgraph and must be planar.\n\nTo do this, we can use the inequality derived from the Handshaking lemma for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIf our graph contains a K3,3 subgraph, then there must be at least two vertices with a degree greater than 3. This means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in the graph would be at least 18 + 2 = 20. However, this would contradict the inequality E ≤ 3V - 6, as:\n\n20 ≤ 3(8) - 6\n20 ≤ 18\n\nThis inequality does not hold true, so our graph cannot contain a K3,3 subgraph.\n\nSince the graph does not contain any Kuratowski's subgraphs (K5 or K3,3), it must be planar."
