    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product AxB and BxA:\n\nAxB = {(2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)}\nBxA = {(3,2), (4,2), (3,3), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of AxB and A:\n\n(AxB)∆A = {x: x ∈ (AxB) or x ∈ A, but not both}\n= {(2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), 2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of A and BxA:\n\nA∆(BxA) = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ (BxA), but not both}\n= {2, (3,2), (4,2), (3,3), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets:\n\n(AxB)∆A = {(2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), 2, 3}\nA∆(BxA) = {2, (3,2), (4,2), (3,3), (4,3)}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, as they have different elements. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
