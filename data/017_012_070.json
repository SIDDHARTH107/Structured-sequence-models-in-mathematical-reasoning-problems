    "message_2": "There are 14 distinct groups of order 16, but we will focus on three of them: the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, and a non-abelian group of order 16, which we will call N16.\n\n1. Cyclic group C16:\n\nThe cyclic group C16 has elements {1, a, a^2, ..., a^15}, where a has order 16. The multiplication table for C16 is straightforward, as the product of any two elements is obtained by adding their exponents modulo 16.\n\n2. Dihedral group D8:\n\nThe dihedral group D8 has elements {r, s}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The group has the following relations: r^8 = 1, s^2 = 1, and sr = r^(-1)s. The multiplication table for D8 is as follows:\n\n```\n   | 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7\n---+----------------------------------------------------------------\n 1 | 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7\n r | r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s\nr^2| r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1  r  sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr\nr^3| r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1  r  r^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2\nr^4| r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1  r  r^2 r^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3\nr^5| r^5 r^6 r^7 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4\nr^6| r^6 r^7 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5\nr^7| r^7 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6\n s | s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7\n sr| sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1\nsr^2| sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1  r\nsr^3| sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1  r  r^2\nsr^4| sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 r^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1  r  r^2 r^3\nsr^5| sr^5 sr^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 r^5 r^6 r^7 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4\nsr^6| sr^6 sr^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 r^6 r^7 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5\nsr^7| sr^7 s  sr sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 sr^5 sr^6 r^7 1  r  r^2 r^3 r^4 r^5 r^6\n```\n\n3. Non-abelian group N16:\n\nThere are several non-abelian groups of order 16, but we will consider one with generators {a, b}, where a^8 = 1, b^2 = a^4, and ba = a^3b. The multiplication table for N16 is quite large, so we will not write it out here. However, you can construct it using the relations above.\n\nTo show that these tables satisfy the axioms of a group, we need to check the following:\n\n1. Closure: The product of any two elements in the group is also in the group.\n2. Associativity: The product (ab)c is the same as a(bc) for all elements a, b, and c in the group.\n3. Identity: There exists an identity element (1) such that 1a = a1 = a for all elements a in the group.\n4. Inverses: For each element a in the group, there exists an inverse element a^(-1) such that aa^(-1) = a^(-1)a = 1.\n\nFor each of the three groups, you can verify that these axioms hold by examining the multiplication tables and using the relations given."
