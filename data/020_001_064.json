    "message_1": "A company manufactures two types of products, A and B, which require time and resources to produce. The production of 1 unit of A takes 4 hours of processing time and 2 hours of assembly time, while the production of 1 unit of B takes 3 hours of processing time and 1 hour of assembly time. The company has 28 hours of processing time and 12 hours of assembly time available each day. Also, the profit from the sale of 1 unit of A is $50, and the profit from the sale of 1 unit of B is $30. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can make each day if they have to produce at least 2 units of A and 3 units of B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of A produced and y be the number of units of B produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. 4x + 3y ≤ 28 (processing time constraint)\n2. 2x + y ≤ 12 (assembly time constraint)\n3. x ≥ 2 (minimum units of A)\n4. y ≥ 3 (minimum units of B)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 50x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies all the constraints. To do this, we can graph the inequalities:\n\n1. y ≤ (28 - 4x) / 3\n2. y ≤ 12 - 2x\n3. x ≥ 2\n4. y ≥ 3\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all these inequalities. By analyzing the graph, we can find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nA(2, 3)\nB(2, 6)\nC(4, 2)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(A) = 50(2) + 30(3) = 100 + 90 = $190\nP(B) = 50(2) + 30(6) = 100 + 180 = $280\nP(C) = 50(4) + 30(2) = 200 + 60 = $260\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B, where the company produces 2 units of A and 6 units of B, resulting in a profit of $280 per day."
