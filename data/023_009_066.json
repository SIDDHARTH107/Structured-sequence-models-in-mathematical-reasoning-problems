Find the Fourier transform of f(x) and use it to determine the solution of the boundary value problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve the boundary value problem using Fourier series, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) = x(π - x) over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π. Since the function is defined over a finite interval and it's an even function, we can use the Fourier cosine series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients given by:\n\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0)] dx from 0 to π\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx from 0 to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[x(π - x) * cos(0)] dx from 0 to π\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[x(π - x)] dx from 0 to π\na_0 = (2/π) * [πx^2/2 - x^3/3] from 0 to π\na_0 = (2/π) * [π^3/2 - π^3/3] = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[x(π - x) * cos(n * x)] dx from 0 to π\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x(π - x) and dv = cos(n * x) dx\nThen du = (π - 2x) dx and v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/n) * x(π - x) * sin(n * x) - (1/n) * ∫[(π - 2x) * sin(n * x) dx]] from 0 to π\n\nNow, let's use integration by parts again for the remaining integral:\n\nLet u = (π - 2x) and dv = sin(n * x) dx\nThen du = -2 dx and v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/n) * x(π - x) * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * (π - 2x) * cos(n * x) + (2/n^2) * ∫[cos(n * x) dx]] from 0 to π\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/n) * x(π - x) * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * (π - 2x) * cos(n * x) + (2/n^3) * sin(n * x)] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [0 + (1/n^2) * π * cos(n * π) + 0 - 0 - 0 + 0]\na_n = (2/π) * (1/n^2) * π * cos(n * π)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2/π) * (1/n^2) * π * cos(n * π) * cos(n * x)]\n\nSimplifying:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2/n^2) * cos(n * π) * cos(n * x)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x(π - x) over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π. Since the boundary conditions f(0) = 0 and f(π) = 0 are already satisfied by the given function, the Fourier series representation is the solution to the boundary value problem."
