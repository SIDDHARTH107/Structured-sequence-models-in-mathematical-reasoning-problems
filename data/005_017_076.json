    "message_2": "To determine the number of principal components needed to explain at least 90% of the variation in this data set, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data.\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix.\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n4. Determine the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.\n5. Select the number of principal components that explain at least 90% of the variation.\n\nStep 1: Standardize the data\nFirst, we need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable.\n\nVariable 1: (10, 12, 8, 9, 11, 13, 7, 6, 14, 15)\nMean: 10.5, Standard deviation: 2.8722813232690143\nStandardized Variable 1: (-0.174, 0.522, -0.870, -0.522, 0.174, 0.870, -1.218, -1.566, 1.218, 1.566)\n\nVariable 2: (7, 9, 5, 6, 8, 11, 4, 3, 12, 13)\nMean: 7.8, Standard deviation: 2.8712813232690143\nStandardized Variable 2: (-0.278, 0.417, -0.973, -0.628, 0.069, 1.112, -1.319, -1.674, 1.467, 1.822)\n\nVariable 3: (12, 14, 10, 11, 13, 16, 8, 7, 18, 20)\nMean: 12.9, Standard deviation: 4.00374917893064\nStandardized Variable 3: (-0.225, 0.275, -0.725, -0.475, 0.025, 0.775, -1.225, -1.475, 1.275, 1.775)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the covariance matrix\nUsing the standardized variables, we can calculate the covariance matrix:\n\n|  1.000  0.857  0.946 |\n|  0.857  1.000  0.892 |\n|  0.946  0.892  1.000 |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\nEigenvalues: λ1 = 2.738, λ2 = 0.230, λ3 = 0.032\nEigenvectors: v1 = (0.577, 0.577, 0.577), v2 = (-0.707, 0.707, 0.000), v3 = (0.408, -0.408, 0.816)\n\nStep 4: Determine the proportion of variance explained by each principal component\nTotal variance = λ1 + λ2 + λ3 = 2.738 + 0.230 + 0.032 = 3.000\nProportion of variance explained by PC1 = λ1 / Total variance = 2.738 / 3.000 = 0.913\nProportion of variance explained by PC2 = λ2 / Total variance = 0.230 / 3.000 = 0.077\nProportion of variance explained by PC3 = λ3 / Total variance = 0.032 / 3.000 = 0.011\n\nStep 5: Select the number of principal components that explain at least 90% of the variation\nSince the first principal component (PC1) explains 91.3% of the variation, which is greater than 90%, we only need 1 principal component to explain at least 90% of the variation in this data set."
