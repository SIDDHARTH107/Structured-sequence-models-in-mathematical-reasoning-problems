    "message_2": "To show that the intersection number L^3 is at least 8, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The anticanonical divisor -K_X is ample since X is a Fano variety.\n2. The Picard number of X is 1, which means that every divisor on X is numerically proportional to L or -K_X.\n3. The intersection number is invariant under numerical equivalence.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection number L^3. Since every divisor on X is numerically proportional to L or -K_X, we can write L = aL + b(-K_X) for some non-negative integers a and b. Then, we have:\n\nL^3 = (aL + b(-K_X))^3 = a^3L^3 + 3a^2bL^2(-K_X) + 3ab^2L(-K_X)^2 + b^3(-K_X)^3.\n\nNow, let's consider the terms in this expression:\n\n1. a^3L^3: This term is non-negative since a is a non-negative integer.\n2. 3a^2bL^2(-K_X): This term is non-negative since L and -K_X are ample divisors, and a and b are non-negative integers.\n3. 3ab^2L(-K_X)^2: This term is non-negative since L and -K_X are ample divisors, and a and b are non-negative integers.\n4. b^3(-K_X)^3: This term is non-negative since -K_X is ample and b is a non-negative integer.\n\nSince all the terms in the expression for L^3 are non-negative, we have:\n\nL^3 = a^3L^3 + 3a^2bL^2(-K_X) + 3ab^2L(-K_X)^2 + b^3(-K_X)^3 ≥ 0.\n\nHowever, we want to show that L^3 is at least 8. To do this, we will use the fact that the anticanonical divisor -K_X is ample. By the definition of a Fano variety, we have:\n\n-K_X = mL for some positive integer m.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection number (-K_X)^3:\n\n(-K_X)^3 = (mL)^3 = m^3L^3.\n\nSince -K_X is ample, its self-intersection number (-K_X)^3 must be positive. Therefore, we have:\n\nm^3L^3 > 0.\n\nSince m is a positive integer, we have:\n\nL^3 > 0.\n\nNow, we need to show that L^3 is at least 8. Since L^3 is an integer, the smallest possible value for L^3 greater than 0 is 1. However, if L^3 = 1, then:\n\nm^3L^3 = m^3 = (-K_X)^3 > 0.\n\nThis implies that m = 1, which contradicts the fact that -K_X is ample (since it would mean that -K_X = L, and an ample divisor cannot be numerically equivalent to its negative). Therefore, L^3 cannot be equal to 1.\n\nThe next smallest possible value for L^3 is 8. Since we have already shown that L^3 > 0 and L^3 ≠ 1, we can conclude that L^3 ≥ 8."
