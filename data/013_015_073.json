    "message_1": "An employer hires an employee to perform a task, but the employer does not know the true effort that the employee exerts. The employee can put in a high effort or a low effort, with the latter resulting in a cost to the employer. The payoff matrix below shows the profit (in thousands of dollars) that the employer (principal) gets from the task based on the employee's (agent) effort level:\n\n|     | Low Effort | High Effort |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Low Effort | 3, 5 | 1, 4 |\n| High Effort | 2, 6 | 7, 2 |\n\nIf the employer can only offer a wage of $2,000, what effort level should the employee choose to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "The payoff matrix shows the profit for both the employer (first number) and the employee (second number) based on the effort level of both parties. Since the employer can only offer a wage of $2,000, we need to find the best strategy for the employee to maximize their own payoff.\n\nLet's analyze the employee's payoffs in each scenario:\n\n1. Low Effort (Employer) & Low Effort (Employee): Employee's payoff = 5\n2. Low Effort (Employer) & High Effort (Employee): Employee's payoff = 4\n3. High Effort (Employer) & Low Effort (Employee): Employee's payoff = 6\n4. High Effort (Employer) & High Effort (Employee): Employee's payoff = 2\n\nComparing the payoffs, the employee should choose to exert Low Effort when the employer expects High Effort, as this results in the highest payoff for the employee (6)."
