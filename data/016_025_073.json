    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that consists of a series of equilateral triangles. In each iteration, the triangles are divided into four smaller equilateral triangles, with the middle triangle being removed. \n\nIn the first iteration, there is 1 triangle.\nIn the second iteration, there are 3 triangles.\nIn the third iteration, there are 3^2 = 9 triangles.\nIn the fourth iteration, there are 3^3 = 27 triangles.\n\nSo, in the fourth iteration of the Sierpinski sieve, there are 27 triangles. The side length of the initial triangle does not affect the number of triangles in the iterations."
