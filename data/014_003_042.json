Alice chooses a private key $a=5$ and computes her public key as $A=g^a \\pmod{p}$. She wants to send the message \"87\" to Bob, who has the public key $B=21$. \n\nWhat is the ciphertext that Alice sends to Bob? Use the ElGamal encryption method and show all steps of the computation.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"87\" using the ElGamal encryption method, Alice needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute her public key $A$.\n2. Choose a random ephemeral key $k$.\n3. Compute the first part of the ciphertext $C_1$.\n4. Compute the second part of the ciphertext $C_2$.\n\nLet's go through these steps one by one:\n\n1. Compute Alice's public key $A$:\n\n$A = g^a \\pmod{p} = 3^5 \\pmod{137} = 243 \\pmod{137} = 106$\n\nSo, Alice's public key is $A = 106$.\n\n2. Choose a random ephemeral key $k$:\n\nFor this example, let's choose $k = 7$. In practice, $k$ should be a large random number.\n\n3. Compute the first part of the ciphertext $C_1$:\n\n$C_1 = g^k \\pmod{p} = 3^7 \\pmod{137} = 2187 \\pmod{137} = 46$\n\n4. Compute the second part of the ciphertext $C_2$:\n\nFirst, compute the shared secret $s = B^k \\pmod{p} = 21^7 \\pmod{137} = 1801088541 \\pmod{137} = 29$\n\nThen, compute $C_2 = (M \\times s) \\pmod{p} = (87 \\times 29) \\pmod{137} = 2523 \\pmod{137} = 99$\n\nSo, the ciphertext that Alice sends to Bob is the pair $(C_1, C_2) = (46, 99)$."
