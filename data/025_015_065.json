    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1, 1, 0), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - 1. Then the gradient of F is given by:\n\n∇F = (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z)\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = -2z\n\nNow, we evaluate the gradient at the point (1, 1, 0):\n\n∇F(1, 1, 0) = (2, 2, 0)\n\nThis gradient vector is normal to the tangent plane at the point (1, 1, 0). Therefore, the equation of the tangent plane can be written as:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector, and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point (1, 1, 0). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) + 0(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x - 2 + 2y - 2 = 0\n2x + 2y = 4\n\nDividing by 2, we get the equation of the tangent plane:\n\nx + y = 2"
