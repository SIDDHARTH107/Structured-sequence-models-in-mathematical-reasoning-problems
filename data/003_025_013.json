    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the ship, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and the tangent function to find the angle.\n\nLet Vn be the velocity of the ship in the north direction (30 km/hr) and Ve be the velocity of the current in the east direction (10 km/hr).\n\n1. Find the magnitude of the resultant velocity (Vr):\n\nVr = √(Vn^2 + Ve^2)\nVr = √(30^2 + 10^2)\nVr = √(900 + 100)\nVr = √1000\nVr ≈ 31.62 km/hr\n\n2. Find the direction of the resultant velocity (θ):\n\ntan(θ) = Ve / Vn\ntan(θ) = 10 / 30\ntan(θ) = 1/3\n\nθ = arctan(1/3)\nθ ≈ 18.43 degrees\n\nThe magnitude of the resultant velocity of the ship is approximately 31.62 km/hr, and the direction is approximately 18.43 degrees east of north."
