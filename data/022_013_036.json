    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series representation of the given function, we first need to perform partial fraction decomposition on the function f(z) = (z^2 + 3) / (z^3 - 2z^2 + 5z - 6).\n\nThe denominator can be factored as (z-1)(z^2-z-6) = (z-1)(z-3)(z+2). Now we can write the partial fraction decomposition as:\n\nf(z) = A/(z-1) + B/(z-3) + C/(z+2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator, we get:\n\nz^2 + 3 = A(z-3)(z+2) + B(z-1)(z+2) + C(z-1)(z-3)\n\nNow we can solve for A, B, and C by plugging in values of z that will eliminate the other terms:\n\n1. z = 1: 1^2 + 3 = 4 = A(1-3)(1+2) => A = -1\n2. z = 3: 3^2 + 3 = 12 = B(3-1)(3+2) => B = 1\n3. z = -2: (-2)^2 + 3 = 7 = C(-2-1)(-2-3) => C = -1\n\nSo, f(z) = -1/(z-1) + 1/(z-3) - 1/(z+2)\n\nNow we can find the Laurent series for each term:\n\n1. -1/(z-1) = -1 * (1/(1-z)) = -1 * (1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + ...)\n2. 1/(z-3) = 1 * (1/(3-z)) = 1 * (1/3 + z/9 + z^2/27 + z^3/81 + ...)\n3. -1/(z+2) = -1 * (1/(-2-z)) = -1 * (-1/2 + z/4 - z^2/8 + z^3/16 + ...)\n\nNow, we can add the series together to get the Laurent series representation of f(z):\n\nf(z) = (-1 + 1/3 + 1/2) + (z + z/9 - z/4) + (z^2 + z^2/27 + z^2/8) + (z^3 + z^3/81 - z^3/16) + ...\n\nf(z) = (-1/6) + (5/36)z + (35/216)z^2 + (65/1296)z^3 + ...\n\nThis is the Laurent series representation of the given function centered at z = 0."
