    "message_2": "For an angle of θ = 30°, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the exact values of the trigonometric ratios. A 30-60-90 triangle is a special right triangle where the angles are 30°, 60°, and 90°. The sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30° angle is 1, the side opposite the 60° angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nNow, we can find the trigonometric ratios for θ = 30°:\n\n1. sin(30°) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 1 / 2\n\n2. cos(30°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = √3 / 2\n\n3. tan(30°) = opposite side / adjacent side = 1 / √3 = √3 / 3 (by rationalizing the denominator)\n\nSo, the exact values of the trigonometric ratios for θ = 30° are:\n\nsin(30°) = 1/2\ncos(30°) = √3/2\ntan(30°) = √3/3"
