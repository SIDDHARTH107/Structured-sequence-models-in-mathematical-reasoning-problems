    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the graph of the polynomial equation y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x - 5, we need to find the values of x when y = 0.\n\nSo, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x - 5\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, -5) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nThe factors of -5 are ±1, ±5, and the factors of 1 are ±1. So, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±5.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\nFor x = 1:\n0 = (1)^3 + 2(1)^2 - 4(1) - 5 = 1 + 2 - 4 - 5 = -6 (not a root)\n\nFor x = -1:\n0 = (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 5 = -1 + 2 + 4 - 5 = 0 (a root)\n\nFor x = 5:\n0 = (5)^3 + 2(5)^2 - 4(5) - 5 = 125 + 50 - 20 - 5 = 150 (not a root)\n\nFor x = -5:\n0 = (-5)^3 + 2(-5)^2 - 4(-5) - 5 = -125 + 50 + 20 - 5 = -60 (not a root)\n\nSo, we found one rational root, x = -1. Now, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining roots:\n\n(x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x - 5) / (x + 1)\n\nUsing synthetic division or long division, we find the quotient to be:\n\nx^2 + x - 5\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 5 = 0 using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -5:\n\nx = (-(1) ± √((1)^2 - 4(1)(-5))) / 2(1)\nx = (-1 ± √(1 + 20)) / 2\nx = (-1 ± √21) / 2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the graph of the polynomial equation y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x - 5 are:\n\nx = -1, (-1 + √21) / 2, and (-1 - √21) / 2"
