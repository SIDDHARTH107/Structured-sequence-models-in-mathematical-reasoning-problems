    "message_1": "Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob using a substitution cipher. She decides to use a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5. If the original message contains 20 letters, how many different possible ciphertexts can Alice create?",
    "message_2": "In a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5, each letter in the original message is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Since the shift value is fixed at 5, there is only one possible ciphertext for a given plaintext message. Therefore, Alice can create only 1 ciphertext for the original message containing 20 letters."
