What is the magnitude of the boat's displacement from its starting point, and what is the direction of its displacement from its starting point, measured clockwise from east? Use trigonometry to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the law of cosines and the law of sines.\n\nFirst, let's represent the boat's path as a triangle. The first leg of the journey (30 km due east) will be one side of the triangle, and the second leg of the journey (50 km at 40 degrees north of east) will be another side of the triangle. We'll call the angle between these two sides A, the side opposite angle A as a, the 30 km side as b, and the 50 km side as c.\n\nThe angle A is 180 - 40 = 140 degrees, since the boat veered 40 degrees north of east.\n\nNow, we can use the law of cosines to find the length of side a (the boat's displacement from its starting point):\n\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc * cos(A)\na^2 = 30^2 + 50^2 - 2(30)(50) * cos(140)\na^2 = 900 + 2500 - 3000 * cos(140)\na ≈ 62.16 km\n\nNow, we need to find the direction of the boat's displacement from its starting point, measured clockwise from east. We'll call this angle B.\n\nWe can use the law of sines to find angle B:\n\nsin(B) / b = sin(A) / a\nsin(B) / 30 = sin(140) / 62.16\nsin(B) ≈ 0.394\nB ≈ 23.3 degrees\n\nSince the boat veered north of east, the direction of the boat's displacement from its starting point, measured clockwise from east, is 360 - 23.3 = 336.7 degrees.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's displacement from its starting point is approximately 62.16 km, and the direction of its displacement from its starting point, measured clockwise from east, is approximately 336.7 degrees."
