    "message_2": "To disconnect a connected undirected graph, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create a cut in the graph.\n\nA cut is a partition of the vertices into two non-empty sets, and the cut-set is the set of edges that have one endpoint in each set. The size of the cut-set is the number of edges that cross the cut.\n\nIn a connected graph with n vertices, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph is equal to the size of the minimum cut-set. This is because removing any fewer edges would still leave a path between all pairs of vertices.\n\nTo find the minimum cut-set, we can use the max-flow min-cut theorem, which states that the maximum flow in a network is equal to the minimum capacity of a cut. In this case, the capacity of a cut is the number of edges crossing the cut.\n\nFor a connected undirected graph with 9 vertices and 18 edges, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. The minimum degree of a vertex in the graph is at least 2, as the graph is connected and has more than 2*(n-1) edges, where n is the number of vertices.\n2. There must be at least one vertex with a degree of 2, as the sum of degrees of all vertices is even (2 * number of edges = 2 * 18 = 36), and if all vertices had a degree of at least 3, the sum of degrees would be odd.\n3. If we remove the two edges connected to the vertex with a degree of 2, the graph will be disconnected, as there will be no path between the two sets of vertices separated by the cut.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph is 2."
