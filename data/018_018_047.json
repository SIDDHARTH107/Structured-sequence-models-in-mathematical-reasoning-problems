    "message_2": "The symmetric difference between two sets A and B is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. We can denote the symmetric difference as A Δ B.\n\nFor A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5}, the symmetric difference A Δ B is:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's swap the order of the sets and find the symmetric difference B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = {1, 2, 5}\n\nWhat we notice is that the symmetric difference is the same, regardless of the order of the sets. This means that the symmetric difference operation is commutative, which can be represented as:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A"
