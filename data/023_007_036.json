    "message_2": "To find the time-domain signal g(t), we need to use the inverse Fourier transform formula:\n\ng(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[G(ω) * e^(jωt) dω]\n\nGiven G(ω) = 5δ(ω + 1) + 2jδ(ω) + 2e^(-jω) for -5 < ω < 5, we can break the integral into three parts:\n\ng(t) = (1 / 2π) * [∫(5δ(ω + 1) * e^(jωt) dω) + ∫(2jδ(ω) * e^(jωt) dω) + ∫(2e^(-jω) * e^(jωt) dω)]\n\nNow, let's solve each integral separately:\n\n1) ∫(5δ(ω + 1) * e^(jωt) dω):\nSince δ(ω + 1) is non-zero only when ω = -1, we can evaluate the integral at ω = -1:\n5 * e^(-jt)\n\n2) ∫(2jδ(ω) * e^(jωt) dω):\nSince δ(ω) is non-zero only when ω = 0, we can evaluate the integral at ω = 0:\n2j * e^(0) = 2j\n\n3) ∫(2e^(-jω) * e^(jωt) dω):\nThis integral is not associated with a delta function, so we need to evaluate it over the given range -5 < ω < 5. However, since the function is not band-limited, the integral does not converge. Therefore, this part of the integral does not contribute to the time-domain signal.\n\nNow, we can combine the results of the three integrals:\n\ng(t) = (1 / 2π) * [5 * e^(-jt) + 2j]\n\nSince the third integral does not contribute, the final time-domain signal g(t) is:\n\ng(t) = (5 / 2π) * e^(-jt) + (2j / 2π)"
