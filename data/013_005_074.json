    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nTwo cars are about to engage in a game of Chicken. Car A and Car B both have two strategies: either swerve or continue straight. If both cars swerve, the payoff is 0 for both. If both continue straight, the payoff is -10 for both. If one car swerves and the other continues straight, the swerver gets a payoff of 3 and the straight driver gets a payoff of -3.\n\nIf Car A predicts that Car B will continue straight, what strategy should Car A choose to maximize its payoff?",
    "message_2": "If Car A predicts that Car B will continue straight, then Car A has two options:\n\n1. Swerve: In this case, Car A will get a payoff of 3, and Car B will get a payoff of -3.\n2. Continue straight: In this case, both Car A and Car B will get a payoff of -10.\n\nTo maximize its payoff, Car A should choose to swerve, as it will result in a payoff of 3, which is higher than the -10 payoff if both continue straight."
