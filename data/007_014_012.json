    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first few perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. Perfect numbers can be generated using the formula (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers.\n\nThe first six perfect numbers are generated using the following prime values of p: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, and 17. To find the 7th perfect number, we need to find the next prime value of p.\n\nThe next prime value of p is 19. Therefore, the 7th perfect number can be calculated as follows:\n\n(2^(19-1)) * (2^19 - 1) = (2^18) * (524287) = 262144 * 524287 = 137438691328\n\nSo, the 7th perfect number is 137,438,691,328."
