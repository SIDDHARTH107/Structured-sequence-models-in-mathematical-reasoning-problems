    "message_2": "Yes, there was a time when John and Mary were both jogging together. \n\nTo determine the duration of their shared jogging time, we can find the overlap between their jogging intervals:\n\nJohn's jogging interval: 6:00 AM - 6:45 AM\nMary's jogging interval: 6:30 AM - 7:15 AM\n\nThe overlap starts when Mary begins jogging at 6:30 AM, which is within John's jogging interval. The overlap ends when John stops jogging at 6:45 AM, which is within Mary's jogging interval.\n\nSo, they were jogging together from 6:30 AM to 6:45 AM.\n\nDuration of shared jogging time: 6:45 AM - 6:30 AM = 15 minutes\n\nJohn and Mary were jogging together for 15 minutes."
