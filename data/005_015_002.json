The company has collected the following data on four customers:\n\n| Customer | Number of Purchases | Total Amount Spent |\n| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |\n| A        | 5                  | $100               |\n| B        | 4                  | $80                |\n| C        | 8                  | $200               |\n| D        | 6                  | $120               |\n\nUsing hierarchical clustering with the average linkage method, calculate the distance matrix and construct a dendrogram. How many clusters should the company form based on the dendrogram?",
    "message_2": "To perform hierarchical clustering with the average linkage method, we first need to calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of customers. We can represent each customer as a point in a 2-dimensional space, with the x-axis representing the number of purchases and the y-axis representing the total amount spent.\n\nCustomer coordinates:\nA: (5, 100)\nB: (4, 80)\nC: (8, 200)\nD: (6, 120)\n\nNow, we calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of customers:\n\nDistance AB = sqrt((5-4)^2 + (100-80)^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 20^2) = sqrt(401) ≈ 20.02\nDistance AC = sqrt((5-8)^2 + (100-200)^2) = sqrt(3^2 + 100^2) = sqrt(909) ≈ 30.15\nDistance AD = sqrt((5-6)^2 + (100-120)^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 20^2) = sqrt(401) ≈ 20.02\nDistance BC = sqrt((4-8)^2 + (80-200)^2) = sqrt(4^2 + 120^2) = sqrt(1456) ≈ 38.16\nDistance BD = sqrt((4-6)^2 + (80-120)^2) = sqrt(2^2 + 40^2) = sqrt(1604) ≈ 40.05\nDistance CD = sqrt((8-6)^2 + (200-120)^2) = sqrt(2^2 + 80^2) = sqrt(6404) ≈ 80.02\n\nNow we have the distance matrix:\n\n|   | A      | B      | C      | D      |\n|---|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| A | 0      | 20.02  | 30.15  | 20.02  |\n| B | 20.02  | 0      | 38.16  | 40.05  |\n| C | 30.15  | 38.16  | 0      | 80.02  |\n| D | 20.02  | 40.05  | 80.02  | 0      |\n\nNow we perform the average linkage hierarchical clustering:\n\n1. Merge the closest pair of customers (A and D) into a cluster, since they have the smallest distance (20.02).\n2. Recalculate the distance matrix, using the average distance between the points in the new cluster and the remaining points:\n\n|   | AB     | C      | D      |\n|---|--------|--------|--------|\n| A | 0      | 30.15  | 20.02  |\n| B | 20.02  | 38.16  | 40.05  |\n| C | 30.15  | 0      | 80.02  |\n\n3. Merge the next closest pair of customers (A and B) into a cluster, since they have the smallest distance (20.02) among the remaining pairs.\n4. Recalculate the distance matrix, using the average distance between the points in the new cluster (A and B) and the remaining point (C):\n\n|   | AB     | C      |\n|---|--------|--------|\n| A | 0      | 34.155 |\n| C | 34.155 | 0      |\n\n5. Merge the final pair of customers (AB and C) into a cluster, since there are no more pairs left.\n\nNow, we construct the dendrogram:\n\n```\n      +----- C\n      |\n  +---| +--- A\n  |   | |\n  +---| +--- D\n      |\n      +----- B\n```\n\nBased on the dendrogram, the company should form 2 clusters: one containing customers A and D, and the other containing customers B and C. This is because the largest vertical distance without any horizontal lines is between the first and second merges, which indicates the optimal number of clusters."
