    "message_2": "To determine the number of cyclic subgroups of order 2 in a group of order 12, we first need to find the elements of order 2 in the group. Recall that an element x in a group G has order 2 if x^2 = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nLet's consider the three groups mentioned: C12, A4, and D6.\n\n1. C12: The cyclic group of order 12 is generated by an element a with a^12 = e. The only element of order 2 in C12 is a^6, since (a^6)^2 = a^12 = e. Therefore, C12 has only one cyclic subgroup of order 2, which is {e, a^6}.\n\n2. A4: The alternating group A4 is the group of even permutations of 4 elements. It has order 12 and consists of the identity, three 2-cycles, and eight 3-cycles. The 2-cycles have order 2, so there are three cyclic subgroups of order 2 in A4, each generated by one of the 2-cycles.\n\n3. D6: The dihedral group D6 is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon. It has order 12 and consists of six rotations and six reflections. The reflections have order 2, so there are six cyclic subgroups of order 2 in D6, each generated by one of the reflections.\n\nNow, let's compare the number of cyclic subgroups of order 2 in the given group to the three groups above:\n\n- If the given group has 1 cyclic subgroup of order 2, it is isomorphic to C12.\n- If the given group has 3 cyclic subgroups of order 2, it is isomorphic to A4.\n- If the given group has 6 cyclic subgroups of order 2, it is isomorphic to D6.\n\nAs for other subgroups of order 2, note that all subgroups of order 2 are cyclic since 2 is prime. Therefore, there are no other subgroups of order 2 besides the cyclic ones."
