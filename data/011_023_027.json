    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is determined by the graph's chromatic number. The chromatic number depends on the structure of the graph, specifically its maximum degree (the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex).\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices, which is 9.\n\nHowever, without more information about the structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact minimum number of colors needed."
