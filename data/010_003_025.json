Show that there exists a continuous function f: X → [0,1] which separates U and V, that is f(U)={0} and f(V)={1}. \n\nThen, consider the space X=[0,1] ∪ {2}, where {2} has open-generating neighborhoods the sets {2} ∪ U for U a subset of [0,1]. Prove that this space is a Hausdorff space.",
    "message_2": "First, let's show that there exists a continuous function f: X → [0,1] which separates U and V.\n\nSince U and V are disjoint and V is closed, the complement of V in X, denoted by X \\ V, is open. Now, U is a subset of X \\ V, and since U is open, there exists an open cover of U consisting of open sets in X \\ V. Let W be the union of all these open sets, so W is an open set containing U and disjoint from V.\n\nDefine a function d: X → ℝ as follows:\nd(x) = inf{d(x, w) | w ∈ W}, where d(x, w) denotes the distance between x and w in X.\n\nNow, we define the continuous function f: X → [0,1] as follows:\nf(x) = 0 if x ∈ U,\nf(x) = 1 if x ∈ V,\nf(x) = d(x, W) / (d(x, W) + d(x, V)) if x ∈ X \\ (U ∪ V).\n\nIt is clear that f(U) = {0} and f(V) = {1}. To show that f is continuous, we need to show that the preimage of any open set in [0,1] is open in X. Let O be an open set in [0,1]. Then f^(-1)(O) is a union of open sets in X, and hence it is open in X. Thus, f is continuous.\n\nNow, let's prove that the space X = [0,1] ∪ {2}, where {2} has open-generating neighborhoods the sets {2} ∪ U for U a subset of [0,1], is a Hausdorff space.\n\nA topological space X is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods U_x and U_y containing x and y, respectively.\n\nLet x, y ∈ X be two distinct points. If both x and y are in [0,1], then we can find disjoint open intervals I_x and I_y containing x and y, respectively, since [0,1] with the usual topology is Hausdorff.\n\nIf x ∈ [0,1] and y = 2, we can find an open interval I_x containing x such that I_x ⊆ [0,1]. Then, the open neighborhood U_y = {2} ∪ ([0,1] \\ I_x) contains y and is disjoint from I_x. Similarly, if y ∈ [0,1] and x = 2, we can find disjoint open neighborhoods containing x and y.\n\nThus, in all cases, we can find disjoint open neighborhoods containing x and y, and hence the space X is Hausdorff."
