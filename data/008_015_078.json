    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n4 & 9 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nx = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n12 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition decomposes a symmetric positive-definite matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, such that A = LL^T.\n\nThe Cholesky decomposition of matrix A is:\n\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\sqrt{2} & -1 & \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nL^T = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{2} & 2 & \\sqrt{2} \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will solve the system LL^Tx = b in two steps:\n\n1. Solve Ly = b for y\n2. Solve L^Tx = y for x\n\nStep 1: Solve Ly = b for y\n\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\sqrt{2} & -1 & \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\ny = \\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n12 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving the system, we get:\n\ny_1 = 4 / \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\ny_2 = (12 - 4y_1) = 4\ny_3 = (6 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 4) / \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n\nSo, y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Solve L^Tx = y for x\n\nL^T = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{2} & 2 & \\sqrt{2} \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nx = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\ny = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving the system, we get:\n\nz = 2\\sqrt{2} / \\sqrt{2} = 2\ny = 4 + z = 6\nx = (2\\sqrt{2} - 4 - 2) / \\sqrt{2} = -1\n\nSo, x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n6 \\\\\n2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1, y = 6, and z = 2."
