    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = 1/(z+2) centered at z = 1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z-1):\n\nf(z) = 1/(z+2) = 1/((z-1)+3)\n\nNow, we want to express the function as a series of the form:\n\nf(z) = Σ a_n (z-1)^n\n\nWe can do this using the geometric series formula:\n\n1/(1-x) = Σ x^n for |x| < 1\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n1/((z-1)+3) = 1/(1 - (-(z-1)/3))\n\nNow, we can apply the geometric series formula with x = -(z-1)/3:\n\nf(z) = Σ [(-1)^n ((z-1)/3)^n] for |(z-1)/3| < 1\n\nf(z) = Σ [(-1)^n (1/3)^n (z-1)^n] for |z-1| < 3\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = 1/(z+2) centered at z = 1 is:\n\nf(z) = Σ [(-1)^n (1/3)^n (z-1)^n]\n\nThe radius of convergence is given by the condition |(z-1)/3| < 1, which implies |z-1| < 3. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 3."
