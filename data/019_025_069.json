On the other hand, only 60% of the students who do not attend math classes regularly score an A grade. If a student scores an A grade, what is the probability that they attend math classes regularly?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the conditional probability formula to solve this problem. We want to find the probability that a student attends math classes regularly given that they scored an A grade, which can be written as P(Regular Attendance | A grade).\n\nWe can use the formula: P(Regular Attendance | A grade) = P(A grade and Regular Attendance) / P(A grade)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probabilities of each event. Let's assume that x% of students attend math classes regularly. Then, (100-x)% of students do not attend math classes regularly.\n\nP(A grade and Regular Attendance) = x% * 90%\nP(A grade and Not Regular Attendance) = (100-x)% * 60%\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of scoring an A grade, which can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of scoring an A grade in both cases (regular attendance and not regular attendance):\n\nP(A grade) = P(A grade and Regular Attendance) + P(A grade and Not Regular Attendance)\nP(A grade) = x% * 90% + (100-x)% * 60%\n\nSince we don't have the exact percentage of students who attend math classes regularly (x%), we cannot find the exact probability. However, we can express the probability in terms of x:\n\nP(Regular Attendance | A grade) = (x% * 90%) / (x% * 90% + (100-x)% * 60%)\n\nThis formula shows the probability of a student attending math classes regularly given that they scored an A grade, depending on the percentage of students who attend math classes regularly (x%)."
