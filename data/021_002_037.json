    "message_2": "To find the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of matrix A using the power iteration method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial vector `v0 = [1, 1, 1]'`.\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current vector `v` to get a new vector `w = A * v`.\n3. Normalize the new vector `w` to get the next vector `v`.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for 10 iterations.\n5. The largest eigenvalue is the ratio of the components of the last two vectors, and the corresponding eigenvector is the last vector obtained.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method for 10 iterations:\n\nInitial vector: v0 = [1, 1, 1]'\n\nIteration 1:\nw1 = A * v0 = [6, 15, 24]'\nv1 = w1 / ||w1|| = [6/27, 15/27, 24/27]' = [2/9, 5/9, 8/9]'\n\nIteration 2:\nw2 = A * v1 = [36/9, 90/9, 144/9]'\nv2 = w2 / ||w2|| = [36/270, 90/270, 144/270]' = [2/15, 1/3, 8/15]'\n\nIteration 3:\nw3 = A * v2 = [60/15, 150/15, 240/15]'\nv3 = w3 / ||w3|| = [60/450, 150/450, 240/450]' = [2/15, 1/3, 8/15]'\n\nSince v3 = v2, the power iteration has converged, and there is no need to perform further iterations.\n\nThe largest eigenvalue can be found by taking the ratio of the components of the last two vectors:\n\nEigenvalue = (w3[1] / v2[1]) = (60/15) / (2/15) = 30/2 = 15\n\nThe corresponding eigenvector is the last vector obtained:\n\nEigenvector = v3 = [2/15, 1/3, 8/15]'\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue of matrix A is 15, and the corresponding eigenvector is [2/15, 1/3, 8/15]'."
