    "message_1": "A company conducted a survey with their 100 employees asking about their age and monthly salary. The data collected has been analyzed using cluster analysis to group employees based on their age and salary. If the analysis resulted in 4 clusters, which 4 groups of employees were formed based on their age and salary? Can you provide the details of each group such as the age range, salary range, and number of employees in each group?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot provide the exact details of the 4 groups without the raw data from the survey. However, I can give you a general idea of how the cluster analysis might have grouped the employees based on their age and salary.\n\nCluster analysis is a technique used to group similar data points together based on their characteristics. In this case, the employees are grouped based on their age and salary. The resulting clusters might look something like this:\n\n1. Cluster 1: Young employees with low salaries\n   - Age range: 20-30 years old\n   - Salary range: $30,000 - $50,000\n   - Number of employees: This would depend on the data distribution, let's say 30 employees.\n\n2. Cluster 2: Middle-aged employees with moderate salaries\n   - Age range: 31-45 years old\n   - Salary range: $50,001 - $70,000\n   - Number of employees: Again, this would depend on the data distribution, let's say 35 employees.\n\n3. Cluster 3: Middle-aged employees with high salaries\n   - Age range: 31-45 years old\n   - Salary range: $70,001 - $100,000\n   - Number of employees: Depending on the data distribution, let's say 20 employees.\n\n4. Cluster 4: Older employees with high salaries\n   - Age range: 46-60 years old\n   - Salary range: $70,001 - $100,000\n   - Number of employees: Based on the data distribution, let's say 15 employees.\n\nPlease note that these are just hypothetical clusters and the actual clusters would depend on the data collected from the survey. To provide the exact details of each group, I would need the raw data from the survey to perform the cluster analysis."
