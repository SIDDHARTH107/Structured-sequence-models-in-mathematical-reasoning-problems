    "message_2": "To determine if the knots are equivalent, we will analyze the number of crossings and the way the strands pass through each other.\n\nKnot 1:\n- There are 6 crossings.\n- The crossings alternate between over and under as we follow the strand.\n\nKnot 2:\n- There are 6 crossings.\n- The crossings also alternate between over and under as we follow the strand.\n\nSince both knots have the same number of crossings and the strands pass through each other in the same alternating pattern, we can conclude that the knots are equivalent. They can be transformed into each other without cutting or joining any strands."
