    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference, π is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven a diameter of 10 cm, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = π * 10\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 10\nC ≈ 31.4159\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the circumference is approximately 31.42 cm."
