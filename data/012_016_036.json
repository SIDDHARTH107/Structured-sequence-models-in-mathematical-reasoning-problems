    "message_2": "To compute the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we use the following recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-e; x, y) + T(G*e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G-e; x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G-e; x, y) if e is a loop,\nT(G; x, y) = 1 if G has no edges.\n\nHere, G = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {(1,2), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), (4,5), (5,4)}).\n\nFirst, we need to find a bridge or a loop in G. There are no loops in G. Edge (4,5) is a bridge since its removal increases the number of connected components in G. So, we will remove the bridge (4,5) and calculate the Tutte polynomial for the remaining graph.\n\nG - (4,5) = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {(1,2), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), (5,4)}).\n\nNow, we need to find a bridge or a loop in G - (4,5). There are no loops in G - (4,5). Edge (4,1) is a bridge since its removal increases the number of connected components in G - (4,5). So, we will remove the bridge (4,1) and calculate the Tutte polynomial for the remaining graph.\n\nG - (4,5) - (4,1) = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {(1,2), (2,3), (3,1), (5,4)}).\n\nNow, we need to find a bridge or a loop in G - (4,5) - (4,1). There are no loops in G - (4,5) - (4,1). Edge (5,4) is a bridge since its removal increases the number of connected components in G - (4,5) - (4,1). So, we will remove the bridge (5,4) and calculate the Tutte polynomial for the remaining graph.\n\nG - (4,5) - (4,1) - (5,4) = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)}).\n\nNow, we have a triangle graph with vertices {1, 2, 3} and no bridges or loops. We can apply the recursive formula for the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT(G - (4,5) - (4,1) - (5,4); x, y) = T(G - (4,5) - (4,1) - (5,4) - (1,2); x, y) + T(G - (4,5) - (4,1) - (5,4) * (1,2); x, y).\n\nThe first term corresponds to the graph with two edges, and the second term corresponds to the graph with one edge. We can compute the Tutte polynomial for these two graphs:\n\nT(G - (4,5) - (4,1) - (5,4) - (1,2); x, y) = T(({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {(2,3), (3,1)}); x, y) = (x-1)(y-1).\n\nT(G - (4,5) - (4,1) - (5,4) * (1,2); x, y) = T(({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {(2,3), (3,1), (1,2)}); x, y) = y.\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomial for the original graph G:\n\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G - (4,5); x, y) = x * (x * T(G - (4,5) - (4,1); x, y)) = x^2 * T(G - (4,5) - (4,1) - (5,4); x, y) = x^2 * ((x-1)(y-1) + y).\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of G is:\n\nT(G; x, y) = x^2((x-1)(y-1) + y)."
