    "message_2": "First, we'll distribute the numbers outside the parentheses to the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n-2 * 3x = -6x\n-2 * -4 = 8\n5 * 2x = 10x\n5 * 1 = 5\n\nNow, we'll rewrite the expression with the simplified terms:\n\n-6x + 8 + 10x + 5 - 6x\n\nNext, we'll combine like terms:\n\n-6x + 10x - 6x = -2x\n\nAnd finally, we'll add the constants:\n\n8 + 5 = 13\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n-2x + 13"
