    "message_1": "A system is described by the following equation: \n\ndy/dt + 5y = x(t)\n\nWhere y(0) = 2 and x(t) is given by the Fourier series: \n\nx(t) = 6 + 2sin(t) + 4sin(3t)\n\nUse the Fourier transform to analyze the stability of the system. Specifically, determine if the system is BIBO stable.",
    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the system using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the transfer function of the system. The given system is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, and its equation is:\n\ndy/dt + 5y = x(t)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation, we get:\n\njωY(ω) + 5Y(ω) = X(ω)\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) by dividing both sides by X(ω):\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / X(ω) = 1 / (5 + jω)\n\nThe system is BIBO (Bounded Input, Bounded Output) stable if the transfer function H(ω) is absolutely integrable, i.e., the following integral converges:\n\n∫ |H(ω)| dω from -∞ to ∞\n\nLet's calculate the magnitude of H(ω):\n\n|H(ω)| = |1 / (5 + jω)| = 1 / √(5^2 + ω^2)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the integral:\n\n∫ |H(ω)| dω from -∞ to ∞ = ∫ (1 / √(25 + ω^2)) dω from -∞ to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet ω = 5 * tan(θ), then dω = 5 * sec^2(θ) dθ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\n∫ (1 / √(25 + (5 * tan(θ))^2)) * 5 * sec^2(θ) dθ from -π/2 to π/2\n\nSimplifying the integral:\n\n∫ sec(θ) dθ from -π/2 to π/2\n\nThe integral of sec(θ) is ln|sec(θ) + tan(θ)|, so we have:\n\nln|sec(π/2) + tan(π/2)| - ln|sec(-π/2) + tan(-π/2)|\n\nSince sec(π/2) and tan(π/2) are not defined, the integral does not converge.\n\nTherefore, the system is not BIBO stable."
