    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the non-convex function f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + x, we can use the method of finding critical points and analyzing them. \n\nFirst, find the first and second derivatives of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 4x + 1\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 4\n\nNow, set the first derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n4x^3 - 4x + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the approximate solutions. Using a numerical solver, we find three critical points:\n\nx ≈ -1.2207\nx ≈ 0.0\nx ≈ 1.2207\n\nNow, we will analyze the critical points using the second derivative test:\n\nf''(-1.2207) ≈ 12(-1.2207)^2 - 4 ≈ 10.97 > 0 (local minimum)\nf''(0) ≈ 12(0)^2 - 4 ≈ -4 < 0 (local maximum)\nf''(1.2207) ≈ 12(1.2207)^2 - 4 ≈ 10.97 > 0 (local minimum)\n\nWe have two local minima at x ≈ -1.2207 and x ≈ 1.2207. To find the global minimum, we need to compare the function values at these points:\n\nf(-1.2207) ≈ (-1.2207)^4 - 2(-1.2207)^2 + (-1.2207) ≈ -1.5427\nf(1.2207) ≈ (1.2207)^4 - 2(1.2207)^2 + (1.2207) ≈ -1.5427\n\nBoth local minima have the same function value, so they both represent the global minimum of the function. Therefore, the global minimum of f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + x is approximately -1.5427, and it is achieved at x ≈ -1.2207 and x ≈ 1.2207."
