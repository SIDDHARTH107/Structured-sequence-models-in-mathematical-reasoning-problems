    "message_2": "To find the maximum independent set in this graph, we need to select the maximum number of non-adjacent vertices. In this graph, we can select the following vertices: 1, 4, and 7. This is because these vertices are not connected to each other by any edges, and no other non-adjacent vertex can be added to this set without violating the independence condition.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-adjacent vertices that can be selected from this graph is 3."
