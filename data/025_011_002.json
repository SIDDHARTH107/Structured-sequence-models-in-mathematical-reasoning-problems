    "message_2": "To show that $E(\\mathbb{C})$ is isomorphic to the Abelian variety $A=(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z})^2$, we first recall some facts about elliptic curves and Abelian varieties.\n\nAn elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\\mathbb{C}$ can be represented as a complex torus, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is a lattice in $\\mathbb{C}$. The lattice $\\Lambda$ can be generated by two linearly independent complex numbers $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$, so $\\Lambda = \\{m\\omega_1 + n\\omega_2 : m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The complex torus $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$ is an Abelian variety of dimension 1.\n\nNow, let $A=(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z})^2$. This is an Abelian variety of dimension 2, and it can be represented as $\\mathbb{C}^2/\\Lambda'$, where $\\Lambda' = \\{(m_1, m_2) : m_1, m_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. Since the dimension of $E(\\mathbb{C})$ is 1, we need to show that there exists an isomorphism between $E(\\mathbb{C})$ and a 1-dimensional subvariety of $A$.\n\nConsider the map $\\phi: E(\\mathbb{C}) \\to A$ defined by $\\phi(P) = (x(P), y(P))$, where $x(P)$ and $y(P)$ are the x and y coordinates of the point $P$ on the elliptic curve $E$. This map is a group homomorphism, and its kernel is the set of points of order 19 in $E(\\mathbb{C})$. By the isomorphism theorem for groups, we have that $E(\\mathbb{C})/\\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\text{Im}(\\phi)$, which is a 1-dimensional subvariety of $A$. Thus, $E(\\mathbb{C})$ is isomorphic to the Abelian variety $A=(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\n\nNext, we want to find the number of points of order 19 in $E(\\mathbb{C})$. Since $E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z}$, there are 19 points in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ including the point at infinity. All these points are also in $E(\\mathbb{C})$, and they are all of order 19. Thus, there are 19 points of order 19 in $E(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nFinally, we want to find the number of connected components of $E(\\mathbb{C})$ reduced modulo 19. Since $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ has 19 points, and each of these points is of order 19, the reduction of $E(\\mathbb{C})$ modulo 19 will have 19 connected components, one for each point in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$."
