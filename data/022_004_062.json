    "message_2": "To determine the nature of the singularity of the function f(z) = (sin z)/z at z = 0, we can use the limit definition of a removable singularity, a pole, and an essential singularity.\n\nA removable singularity occurs when the limit of the function as z approaches the singularity exists and is finite. A pole occurs when the limit of the function as z approaches the singularity is infinite. An essential singularity occurs when the limit of the function as z approaches the singularity does not exist or is not well-defined.\n\nLet's analyze the limit of f(z) as z approaches 0:\n\nlim (z -> 0) (sin z)/z\n\nWe can use L'Hôpital's rule since the limit is of the form 0/0. L'Hôpital's rule states that if the limit of the ratio of the derivatives of the numerator and denominator exists, then the limit of the original function exists and is equal to that limit.\n\nTaking the derivative of the numerator and denominator with respect to z:\n\nd(sin z)/dz = cos z\nd(z)/dz = 1\n\nNow, we can apply L'Hôpital's rule:\n\nlim (z -> 0) (cos z)/1 = cos(0)/1 = 1\n\nSince the limit exists and is finite, the singularity at z = 0 is a removable singularity."
