    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x), we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign. \n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6)\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 11)\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x where f''(x) = 0:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n\n6x = 12\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 2. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, we can plug this value back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 11(2) - 6\nf(2) = 8 - 24 + 22 - 6\nf(2) = -16 + 22 - 6\nf(2) = 6 - 6\nf(2) = 0\n\nThus, the inflection point of the function f(x) is at (2, 0)."
