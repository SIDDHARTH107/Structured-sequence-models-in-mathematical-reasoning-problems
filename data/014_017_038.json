    "message_1": "The following could be a question for a math student to solve related to Cryptography and Frequency analysis:\n\nSuppose you have a message that was encrypted using a substitution cipher, and you suspect that the most frequent letter in the encrypted message represents the letter \"E\" in English language. If the most frequent letter in the encrypted message appears 70 times, and the total number of letters in the message is 500, then what is the estimated frequency of the letter \"E\" in the decrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To find the estimated frequency of the letter \"E\" in the decrypted message, we can use the following formula:\n\nFrequency of \"E\" = (Number of times \"E\" appears / Total number of letters) * 100\n\nIn this case, the most frequent letter in the encrypted message appears 70 times, and we suspect that it represents the letter \"E\". The total number of letters in the message is 500. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFrequency of \"E\" = (70 / 500) * 100\n\nFrequency of \"E\" = 0.14 * 100\n\nFrequency of \"E\" = 14%\n\nSo, the estimated frequency of the letter \"E\" in the decrypted message is 14%."
