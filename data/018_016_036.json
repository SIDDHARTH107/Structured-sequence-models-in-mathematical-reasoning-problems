    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these sets:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B x A) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, both sets (A x B) U (B x A) and (B x A) U (A x B) contain the same elements, so they are equal. My initial statement that the two sets are not equal was incorrect. The two sets are indeed equal:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = (B x A) U (A x B)"
