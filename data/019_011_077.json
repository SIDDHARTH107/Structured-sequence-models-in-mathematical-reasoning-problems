    "message_1": "Suppose that John has a collection of marbles. If he gives away one-third of his marbles and then gives away three more, he will have 21 left. How many marbles did John have originally?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of marbles John originally had. If he gives away one-third of his marbles, he will have 2/3x marbles left. Then, he gives away 3 more marbles, so he has (2/3x - 3) marbles left. We know that he has 21 marbles left after giving away the marbles, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(2/3x - 3) = 21\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2/3x - 3 + 3 = 21 + 3\n2/3x = 24\n\nTo isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:\n\n(3/2)(2/3x) = 24(3/2)\nx = 36\n\nSo, John originally had 36 marbles."
