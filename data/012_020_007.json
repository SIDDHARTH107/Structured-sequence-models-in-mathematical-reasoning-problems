    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all permutations of its vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. In other words, it is the set of all isomorphisms of the graph onto itself. The order of the automorphism group is the number of such isomorphisms.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the automorphisms by considering the possible mappings of the vertices:\n\n1. The vertex of degree 3 (vertex 1) can only be mapped to itself.\n2. The vertices of degree 2 (vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) can be mapped to each other.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible mappings for the vertices of degree 2:\n\n- Vertex 2 can be mapped to vertices 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n- If vertex 2 is mapped to vertex 3, then vertex 3 must be mapped to vertex 2, and vertices 4, 5, and 6 can be mapped to each other in any order. This gives us 3! = 6 automorphisms.\n- If vertex 2 is mapped to vertex 4, then vertex 4 must be mapped to vertex 2, vertex 3 must be mapped to vertex 5, and vertex 5 must be mapped to vertex 3. Vertex 6 can only be mapped to itself. This gives us 1 automorphism.\n- If vertex 2 is mapped to vertex 5, then vertex 5 must be mapped to vertex 2, vertex 3 must be mapped to vertex 4, and vertex 4 must be mapped to vertex 3. Vertex 6 can only be mapped to itself. This gives us 1 automorphism.\n- If vertex 2 is mapped to vertex 6, then vertex 6 must be mapped to vertex 2, and vertices 3, 4, and 5 can be mapped to each other in any order. This gives us 3! = 6 automorphisms.\n\nIn total, there are 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 14 automorphisms. Therefore, the order of the automorphism group of the graph is 14."
