    "message_1": "In a community, there are 1000 members. The probability of a member attending a social event is 0.3. What is the probability that exactly 300 members will attend the event?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, members attending the event)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of members in the community)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of members attending the event)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a member attending the event)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 1000 (total number of members)\n- k = 300 (number of members attending the event)\n- p = 0.3 (probability of a member attending the event)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 300) = C(1000, 300) * 0.3^300 * (1-0.3)^(1000-300)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(1000, 300):\n\nC(1000, 300) = 1000! / (300!(1000-300)!)\nC(1000, 300) = 1000! / (300!700!)\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.3^300 and (1-0.3)^(1000-300):\n\n0.3^300 ≈ 5.02 * 10^(-64)\n(1-0.3)^(1000-300) = 0.7^700 ≈ 2.76 * 10^(-104)\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 300) = (1000! / (300!700!)) * (5.02 * 10^(-64)) * (2.76 * 10^(-104))\n\nTo calculate the final probability, we can use a calculator or software that can handle large numbers and factorials. The result is:\n\nP(X = 300) ≈ 0.0336\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 300 members will attend the event is approximately 0.0336 or 3.36%."
