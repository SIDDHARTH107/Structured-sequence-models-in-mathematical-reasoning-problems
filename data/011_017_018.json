    "message_1": "A 3x3 Latin square needs to be completed using the integers 1, 2 and 3 exactly once in each row and column. How many distinct Latin squares can be created?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct 3x3 Latin squares, we can use a systematic approach. Let's start with the first row:\n\n1. The first row can be any permutation of the numbers 1, 2, and 3. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these numbers, which is 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, let's consider the second row:\n\n2. The second row must have a different number in each column than the first row. Since the first number in the first row can be any of the three numbers, there are only 2 choices left for the first number in the second row. After choosing the first number in the second row, there is only 1 choice left for the third row's first number.\n\n3. For the second number in the second row, there is only 1 choice left (the number that hasn't been used in that column yet). This also determines the second number in the third row.\n\n4. The third number in the second row is determined by the previous choices, as there is only 1 number left that hasn't been used in that column. This also determines the third number in the third row.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- 6 ways to arrange the first row\n- 2 ways to choose the first number in the second row (which also determines the first number in the third row)\n- 1 way to choose the second and third numbers in the second row (which also determines the second and third numbers in the third row)\n\nMultiplying these possibilities together, we get:\n\n6 × 2 × 1 = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 distinct 3x3 Latin squares that can be created."
