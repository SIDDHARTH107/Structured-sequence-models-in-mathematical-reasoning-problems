    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n```\n[ 2, -3,  1 |  1]\n[ 4,  1,  2 |  5]\n[-2,  2, -1 | -7]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we can subtract twice the first row from the second row:\n\n```\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n```\n\n```\n[ 2, -3,  1 |  1]\n[ 0,  7,  0 |  3]\n[-2,  2, -1 | -7]\n```\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we can add the first row to the third row:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 + R1\n```\n\n```\n[ 2, -3,  1 |  1]\n[ 0,  7,  0 |  3]\n[ 0, -1,  0 | -6]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we can add 1/7 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 + (1/7) * R2\n```\n\n```\n[ 2, -3,  1 |  1]\n[ 0,  7,  0 |  3]\n[ 0,  0,  0 | -3]\n```\n\nAt this point, we can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = -3, which is a contradiction. This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution."
