    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game between two players, the first player proposes a split of $100. If the second player accepts the proposal, the money is split according to the proposal. However, if the second player rejects the proposal, neither player gets any money. What is the smallest amount that the first player should offer in order to have a 60% chance that the proposal is accepted?",
    "message_2": "To determine the smallest amount the first player should offer to have a 60% chance of the proposal being accepted, we need to make some assumptions about the second player's behavior. Let's assume that the second player's acceptance probability is directly proportional to the amount offered. This means that the more money the first player offers, the higher the chance the second player will accept the proposal.\n\nLet x be the amount the first player offers, and let y be the probability that the second player accepts the offer. We can express the relationship between x and y as a linear equation:\n\ny = k * x\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality. To find the value of k, we can use the fact that if the first player offers the entire $100, the second player will definitely accept the proposal (100% chance). So when x = 100, y = 1:\n\n1 = k * 100\n\nk = 1/100 = 0.01\n\nNow we can use this value of k to find the smallest amount the first player should offer to have a 60% chance of the proposal being accepted. We want to find x when y = 0.6:\n\n0.6 = 0.01 * x\n\nx = 0.6 / 0.01 = 60\n\nSo the first player should offer at least $60 to have a 60% chance that the proposal is accepted."
