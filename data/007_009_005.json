    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nTo compute φ(n) for a given n, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor φ(21), we first find the prime factors of 21, which are 3 and 7. Now, we can apply the formula:\n\nφ(21) = 21 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/7)\nφ(21) = 21 * (2/3) * (6/7)\nφ(21) = (21 * 2 * 6) / (3 * 7)\nφ(21) = 252 / 21\nφ(21) = 12\n\nSo, the value of φ(21) is 12."
