    "message_1": "Let's say a math student is studying knot theory specifically. Here's a numerical problem they could solve:\n\nConsider a knot in 3-dimensional space represented by a closed loop without self-intersections. Find the smallest positive integer N such that the knot can be unknotted by a sequence of exactly N crossing changes, where a crossing change involves flipping one crossing of the knot (i.e., swapping the positions of the two strands at that crossing).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the simplest non-trivial knot, which is the trefoil knot. The trefoil knot has three crossings, and it is the simplest knot that cannot be untied without cutting the loop.\n\nTo untie the trefoil knot, we need to perform crossing changes. We can start by changing one crossing, but this will still result in a non-trivial knot (specifically, the figure-eight knot). Changing another crossing will also result in a non-trivial knot. However, when we change the third crossing, we will obtain an unknot (a simple loop without any crossings).\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer N such that the knot can be unknotted by a sequence of exactly N crossing changes is N = 3."
