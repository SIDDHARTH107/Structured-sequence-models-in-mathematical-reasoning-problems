    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/((z - 2)^2 (z + 2)) around a closed contour that encloses the points 2 and -2 on the complex plane using residue calculus, we first need to find the residues at the singular points z = 2 and z = -2.\n\n1. Residue at z = 2:\nSince there is a double pole at z = 2, we need to find the first derivative of the function with respect to z and then evaluate it at z = 2.\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 1)/((z - 2)^2 (z + 2))\n\nLet's first find the numerator's derivative:\n\nd/dz (z^2 - 1) = 2z\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of f(z) using the quotient rule:\n\nd/dz f(z) = (2z * ((z - 2)^2 (z + 2)) - (z^2 - 1) * d/dz ((z - 2)^2 (z + 2))) / ((z - 2)^2 (z + 2))^2\n\nd/dz ((z - 2)^2 (z + 2)) = 2(z - 2)(z + 2) + (z - 2)^2\n\nNow, substitute back into the quotient rule equation:\n\nd/dz f(z) = (2z * ((z - 2)^2 (z + 2)) - (z^2 - 1) * (2(z - 2)(z + 2) + (z - 2)^2)) / ((z - 2)^2 (z + 2))^2\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at z = 2:\n\nResidue at z = 2 = d/dz f(z) at z = 2 = (8 - (3)(4 + 4)) / (0)^2 = -4\n\n2. Residue at z = -2:\nSince there is a simple pole at z = -2, we can directly evaluate the function at z = -2:\n\nResidue at z = -2 = f(z) at z = -2 = ((-2)^2 - 1) / ((-2 - 2)^2 (-2 + 2)) = 3 / (16)(0) = -3/16\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the value of the integral:\n\nIntegral = 2πi * (Residue at z = 2 + Residue at z = -2) = 2πi * (-4 - 3/16) = 2πi * (-67/16)\n\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n\nIntegral = -67πi/8"
