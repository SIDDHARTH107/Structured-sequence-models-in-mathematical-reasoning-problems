    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^3 - 1 = 0$\n\nWe can factor this expression using the difference of cubes formula:\n\n$(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0$\n\nThis gives us the following zeros:\n\n1. $z = 1$ (from the factor $z - 1$), which is a simple zero (order 1) since the exponent of the factor is 1.\n\n2. The zeros of the quadratic factor $z^2 + z + 1$ can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\n$z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\nSo, the other two zeros are $z = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ and $z = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$, both of which are also simple zeros (order 1).\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^2 + 9 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation with no real solutions, but it does have two complex solutions:\n\n1. $z = 3i$ (order 1), since the exponent of the factor $(z - 3i)$ is 1.\n2. $z = -3i$ (order 1), since the exponent of the factor $(z + 3i)$ is 1.\n\nIn summary, the meromorphic function $f(z) = \\frac{z^3 - 1}{z^2 + 9}$ has three zeros: $z = 1$, $z = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$, and $z = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$, all of order 1, and two poles: $z = 3i$ and $z = -3i$, both of order 1."
