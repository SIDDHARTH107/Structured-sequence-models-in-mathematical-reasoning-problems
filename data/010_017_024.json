    "message_2": "To compute the Betti numbers of the level sets $M_c$ using Morse inequalities, we first need to analyze the critical points and their indices. Recall that the index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point.\n\nLet's analyze the Hessian matrices at the given critical points:\n\n1. $H_{(1,1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ has eigenvalues 2 and 2, both positive, so the index of the critical point (1,1) is 0.\n\n2. $H_{(1,-1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ has eigenvalues 2 and -2, so the index of the critical point (1,-1) is 1 (since there is one negative eigenvalue).\n\n3. $H_{(-1,1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ has eigenvalues -2 and 2, so the index of the critical point (-1,1) is 1 (since there is one negative eigenvalue).\n\nNow, let's use Morse inequalities to compute the Betti numbers of the level sets $M_c$. Recall that Morse inequalities state that for each non-negative integer k, we have:\n\n$$\\beta_k(M_c) \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k-i} C_i$$\n\nwhere $\\beta_k(M_c)$ is the k-th Betti number of the level set $M_c$, and $C_i$ is the number of critical points of index i.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n- $C_0 = 1$ (the critical point (1,1) has index 0)\n- $C_1 = 2$ (the critical points (1,-1) and (-1,1) have index 1)\n\nNow, we can compute the Betti numbers:\n\n1. For k = 0, we have:\n\n$$\\beta_0(M_c) \\geq C_0 = 1$$\n\nSince $\\beta_0(M_c)$ is the number of connected components of $M_c$, and we know that $M_c$ is non-empty (due to the existence of critical points), we can conclude that $\\beta_0(M_c) = 1$.\n\n2. For k = 1, we have:\n\n$$\\beta_1(M_c) \\geq C_1 - C_0 = 2 - 1 = 1$$\n\nThus, $\\beta_1(M_c) \\geq 1$. However, we cannot determine the exact value of $\\beta_1(M_c)$ from the given information. It could be 1 or greater.\n\nIn summary, for the level sets $M_c$ of the smooth function $f:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, we have:\n\n- $\\beta_0(M_c) = 1$\n- $\\beta_1(M_c) \\geq 1$\n\nWe cannot compute the exact value of $\\beta_1(M_c)$ using the given information and Morse inequalities alone."
