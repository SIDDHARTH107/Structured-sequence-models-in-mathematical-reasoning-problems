    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - x) / x using the quotient rule, we first need to identify the numerator function (u) and the denominator function (v). In this case, u(x) = 3x^2 - x and v(x) = x.\n\nThe quotient rule states that if we have a function f(x) = u(x) / v(x), then the derivative f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (v(x) * u'(x) - u(x) * v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(3x^2 - x)/dx = 6x - 1\nv'(x) = d(x)/dx = 1\n\nNow, we can plug these derivatives and the original functions into the quotient rule formula:\n\nf'(x) = (x * (6x - 1) - (3x^2 - x) * 1) / x^2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = (2 * (6*2 - 1) - (3*(2)^2 - 2) * 1) / (2)^2\nf'(2) = (2 * (12 - 1) - (12 - 2)) / 4\nf'(2) = (2 * 11 - 10) / 4\nf'(2) = (22 - 10) / 4\nf'(2) = 12 / 4\nf'(2) = 3\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - x) / x at the point x = 2 is 3."
