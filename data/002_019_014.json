    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 12 cm and a base radius of 5 cm. Find the surface area of the cone in square centimeters (cm²).",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to find the sum of the base area and the lateral area. The base area is the area of the circular base, and the lateral area is the area of the curved surface.\n\nFirst, let's find the base area (A_base). The formula for the area of a circle is:\n\nA_base = π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base.\n\nA_base = π * (5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nNext, let's find the lateral area (A_lateral). The formula for the lateral area of a cone is:\n\nA_lateral = π * r * l\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, and l is the slant height of the cone. To find the slant height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, since the height, radius, and slant height form a right triangle:\n\nl² = h² + r²\n\nwhere h is the height of the cone.\n\nl² = (12 cm)² + (5 cm)² = 144 cm² + 25 cm² = 169 cm²\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the slant height:\n\nl = √169 cm² = 13 cm\n\nNow, we can find the lateral area:\n\nA_lateral = π * (5 cm) * (13 cm) = 65π cm²\n\nFinally, add the base area and the lateral area to find the total surface area:\n\nSurface area = A_base + A_lateral = 25π cm² + 65π cm² = 90π cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is 90π square centimeters, or approximately 282.74 cm²."
