    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+8) + log2(x-2) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation using the product rule of logarithms, which states that logb(m) + logb(n) = logb(mn):\n\nlog2((x+8)(x-2)) = 3\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation to the base 2:\n\n2^(log2((x+8)(x-2))) = 2^3\n\nSince 2 raised to the power of log base 2 of a number is just the number itself, we have:\n\n(x+8)(x-2) = 8\n\nNow, we can expand the left side of the equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 8x - 16 = 8\n\nx^2 + 6x - 16 = 8\n\nNow, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\nx^2 + 6x - 24 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x + 12)(x - 2) = 0\n\nFinally, we can solve for x by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx + 12 = 0 => x = -12\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. If we plug x = -12 into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog2(-12+8) + log2(-12-2) = log2(-4) + log2(-14)\n\nSince we cannot take the logarithm of a negative number, x = -12 is not a valid solution.\n\nIf we plug x = 2 into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog2(2+8) + log2(2-2) = log2(10) + log2(0)\n\nSince we cannot take the logarithm of zero, x = 2 is also not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, there are no valid solutions for x in the given equation."
