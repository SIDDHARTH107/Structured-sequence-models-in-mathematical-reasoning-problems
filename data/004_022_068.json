    "message_1": "A fence is to be built to enclose a rectangular area of 320 square feet. The fence along three sides is to be made of material that costs 6 dollars per foot, while the material along the fourth side costs 12 dollars per foot. What are the dimensions of the rectangle that minimize the cost of the fence?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. The area of the rectangle is given by A = LW, and we know that A = 320 square feet. So, we have:\n\nLW = 320 (1)\n\nThe cost of the fence is given by the sum of the cost of the three sides with the 6 dollars per foot material and the one side with the 12 dollars per foot material. Let's denote the cost as C:\n\nC = 6L + 6W + 12W = 6L + 18W (2)\n\nWe want to minimize the cost C, so we need to find the dimensions L and W that give the minimum value for C.\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express L in terms of W:\n\nL = 320/W (3)\n\nNow, substitute equation (3) into equation (2) to get the cost function in terms of W only:\n\nC(W) = 6(320/W) + 18W\n\nTo find the minimum cost, we can take the derivative of the cost function with respect to W and set it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dW = -6(320/W^2) + 18\n\nNow, set dC/dW = 0 and solve for W:\n\n0 = -6(320/W^2) + 18\n6(320/W^2) = 18\n320/W^2 = 3\nW^2 = 320/3\nW = √(320/3) ≈ 10.39 feet\n\nNow, use equation (3) to find the corresponding length L:\n\nL = 320/W ≈ 320/10.39 ≈ 30.81 feet\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that minimize the cost of the fence are approximately 10.39 feet for the width and 30.81 feet for the length."
