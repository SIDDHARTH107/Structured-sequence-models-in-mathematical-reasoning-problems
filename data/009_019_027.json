    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the particle will be found between 1.5 and 2.5 at time t=2. We can do this by finding the probability density function (pdf) of the particle's position at time t=2 and then integrating it over the interval [1.5, 2.5].\n\nFirst, we need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The given SDE is a linear SDE with constant coefficients, so we can use the integrating factor method to solve it. The integrating factor is given by $e^{kt}$, so we multiply both sides of the SDE by $e^{kt}$:\n\n$$e^{kt}dX_t = -ke^{kt}(X_t - \\mu)dt + \\sigma e^{kt}dW_t.$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the left-hand side as the differential of the product $e^{kt}X_t$:\n\n$$d(e^{kt}X_t) = -ke^{kt}(\\mu)dt + \\sigma e^{kt}dW_t.$$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to t, we get:\n\n$$e^{kt}X_t - e^{k(0)}X_0 = -k\\mu \\int_0^t e^{ks}ds + \\sigma \\int_0^t e^{ks}dW_s.$$\n\nSince $X_0 = 2$, we have:\n\n$$e^{kt}X_t - 2 = -k\\mu \\int_0^t e^{ks}ds + \\sigma \\int_0^t e^{ks}dW_s.$$\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\n\n$$e^{kt}X_t - 2 = -k\\mu \\left[\\frac{e^{ks}}{k}\\right]_0^t + \\sigma \\int_0^t e^{ks}dW_s.$$\n\n$$e^{kt}X_t - 2 = -\\mu (e^{kt} - 1) + \\sigma \\int_0^t e^{ks}dW_s.$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $X_t$:\n\n$$X_t = \\frac{1}{e^{kt}}(2 + \\mu (e^{kt} - 1) - \\sigma \\int_0^t e^{ks}dW_s).$$\n\nThe solution to the SDE is given by:\n\n$$X_t = 2e^{-kt} + \\mu (1 - e^{-kt}) + \\sigma e^{-kt}\\int_0^t e^{ks}dW_s.$$\n\nNow, we can find the probability density function (pdf) of $X_t$. The pdf of $X_t$ is given by the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of the pdf. For this SDE, the Fokker-Planck equation is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(kp(x,t)) + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(\\sigma^2 p(x,t)).$$\n\nThe solution to this Fokker-Planck equation is given by the Gaussian distribution:\n\n$$p(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2(1-e^{-2kt})}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu - (X_0-\\mu)e^{-kt})^2}{2\\sigma^2(1-e^{-2kt})}\\right).$$\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the particle will be found between 1.5 and 2.5 at time t=2 by integrating the pdf over the interval [1.5, 2.5]:\n\n$$P(1.5 \\le X_2 \\le 2.5) = \\int_{1.5}^{2.5} p(x,2) dx.$$\n\nPlugging in the values for $k=0.5$, $\\mu=1$, $\\sigma=0.2$, and $X_0=2$, we get:\n\n$$P(1.5 \\le X_2 \\le 2.5) = \\int_{1.5}^{2.5} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi (0.2)^2(1-e^{-2(0.5)(2)})}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-1 - (2-1)e^{-0.5(2)})^2}{2(0.2)^2(1-e^{-2(0.5)(2)})}\\right) dx.$$\n\nTo find the numerical value of this probability, we can use a numerical integration method, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, or use software like Mathematica or Python.\n\nUsing a numerical integration method or software, we find that:\n\n$$P(1.5 \\le X_2 \\le 2.5) \\approx 0.788.$$"
