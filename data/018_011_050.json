    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B, which is represented by A∩B. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA∩B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of the intersection (A∩B) and set C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nC = {5}\n\n(A∩B) × C = {(2, 5), (3, 5)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of (A∩B) and C is {(2, 5), (3, 5)}."
