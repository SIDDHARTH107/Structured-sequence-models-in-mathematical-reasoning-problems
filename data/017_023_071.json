    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 72, we first find the prime factorization of 72, which is 2^3 * 3^2. Now, we will use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible Sylow subgroups and their structures.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, the number of such subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 2-Sylow subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, the number of such subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, there are 4 3-Sylow subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3 values:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: In this case, both the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are normal. The group is a direct product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups, which are isomorphic to Z_8 and Z_9, respectively. The group is isomorphic to Z_8 × Z_9, which is abelian.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, the 2-Sylow subgroup is normal, and the 3-Sylow subgroup is not. The group is a semidirect product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. The 2-Sylow subgroup is isomorphic to Z_8, and the 3-Sylow subgroup is isomorphic to Z_9. There are two non-abelian groups in this case: Z_2 × (Z_4 × Z_9) and Z_4 × (Z_2 × Z_9).\n\n3. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1: In this case, the 2-Sylow subgroup is not normal, and the 3-Sylow subgroup is normal. The group is a semidirect product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. The 2-Sylow subgroup is isomorphic to Z_8, and the 3-Sylow subgroup is isomorphic to Z_9. There is one non-abelian group in this case: (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2) × Z_9.\n\n4. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4: In this case, both the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are not normal. There are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 3 non-abelian groups of order 72, and their isomorphism classes are:\n\n1. Z_2 × (Z_4 × Z_9)\n2. Z_4 × (Z_2 × Z_9)\n3. (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2) × Z_9"
