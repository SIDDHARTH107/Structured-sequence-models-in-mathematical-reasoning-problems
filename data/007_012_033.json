    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a natural number p > 1, p is a prime number if and only if (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In other words, the theorem holds for all prime numbers.\n\nThe smallest positive integer for which Wilson's theorem does not hold is 4, which is a composite number. For 4, we have (4-1)! = 3! = 6, and 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4), not -1."
