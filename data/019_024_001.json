The test had a total of 100 points. The class average was 80 points. What is the highest possible score a student could have achieved if they answered only one question correctly?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. There are 20 students in the group.\n2. The test has 10 multiple-choice questions, each with 4 possible answers.\n3. The test has a total of 100 points.\n4. The class average is 80 points.\n5. We need to find the highest possible score a student could have achieved if they answered only one question correctly.\n\nFirst, let's find the total points scored by the class:\n\nTotal points = class average * number of students\nTotal points = 80 * 20\nTotal points = 1600\n\nNow, let's assume that 19 students scored the maximum possible score of 100 points:\n\nTotal points scored by 19 students = 19 * 100\nTotal points scored by 19 students = 1900\n\nSince the total points scored by the class is 1600, this means that the 20th student must have scored:\n\nPoints scored by 20th student = Total points - Total points scored by 19 students\nPoints scored by 20th student = 1600 - 1900\nPoints scored by 20th student = -300\n\nHowever, this is not possible, as a student cannot score negative points. Therefore, we need to adjust the scores of the other 19 students to make it possible for the 20th student to have answered only one question correctly.\n\nLet's assume that 18 students scored the maximum possible score of 100 points:\n\nTotal points scored by 18 students = 18 * 100\nTotal points scored by 18 students = 1800\n\nNow, let's assume that the 19th student scored 90 points:\n\nTotal points scored by 19 students = 1800 + 90\nTotal points scored by 19 students = 1890\n\nNow, we can calculate the points scored by the 20th student:\n\nPoints scored by 20th student = Total points - Total points scored by 19 students\nPoints scored by 20th student = 1600 - 1890\nPoints scored by 20th student = -290\n\nAgain, this is not possible. We need to continue adjusting the scores of the other students until we find a possible score for the 20th student.\n\nAfter several adjustments, we find that if 17 students scored 100 points, 2 students scored 90 points, and the 20th student scored 10 points, the total points scored by the class would be 1600:\n\nTotal points scored by 17 students = 17 * 100 = 1700\nTotal points scored by 2 students = 2 * 90 = 180\nTotal points scored by 20th student = 10\n\nTotal points = 1700 + 180 + 10 = 1600\n\nTherefore, the highest possible score a student could have achieved if they answered only one question correctly is 10 points."
