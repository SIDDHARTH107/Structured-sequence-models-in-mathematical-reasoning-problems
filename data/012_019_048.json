    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn this problem, we have a graph G with 8 vertices and 11 edges, and the degree of each vertex is 3. First, let's find the maximum degree of the graph, denoted by Δ(G). Since the degree of each vertex is 3, Δ(G) = 3.\n\nAccording to Vizing's Theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either equal to Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1. In other words, χ'(G) ∈ {3, 4}.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it's possible to properly color the edges of the graph using only 3 colors. Since the graph has 8 vertices and 11 edges, it's not a regular graph (i.e., not all vertices have the same degree). Therefore, it's not guaranteed that we can use only Δ(G) colors.\n\nIn this case, we can conclude that the chromatic index χ'(G) of the graph G is Δ(G) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4."
