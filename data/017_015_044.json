    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. If n_3 = 4, then there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are guaranteed to be normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibilities for n_2 are 1, 3, and 4. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal in G. If n_2 = 3 or 4, then there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are guaranteed to be normal in G.\n\nNow, let's analyze each group possibility:\n\n1. C24: This is a cyclic group of order 24, which means it has a unique element of order 24. In this case, n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1, as there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. If G has these properties, then G is isomorphic to C24.\n\n2. A5: The alternating group A5 has order 60, not 24, so G cannot be isomorphic to A5.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 24: There are five non-abelian groups of order 24, but we will focus on two main cases:\n\n   a) G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a non-normal Sylow 2-subgroup (n_3 = 1, n_2 = 3 or 4). In this case, G is isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 24, such as the semidirect product of Z3 and Z8 or Z3 and Z4 x Z2.\n   \n   b) G has a non-normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a non-normal Sylow 2-subgroup (n_3 = 4, n_2 = 3 or 4). In this case, G is isomorphic to another non-abelian group of order 24, such as the symmetric group S4.\n\nTo determine which group G is isomorphic to, we need to find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups in G. If G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then G is isomorphic to C24. If G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a non-normal Sylow 2-subgroup, or if G has non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups and non-normal Sylow 2-subgroups, then G is isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 24."
