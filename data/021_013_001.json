    "message_2": "Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is used to find the global minimum of a function. In this case, we will use it to find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 15.\n\nHere are the steps to perform simulated annealing:\n\n1. Initialize the temperature T to 1000.\n2. Choose a random initial solution x.\n3. Repeat until the temperature T is sufficiently small:\n   a. Choose a random neighbor x' of x within the neighborhood range of 0.1.\n   b. Calculate the change in the objective function Δf = f(x') - f(x).\n   c. If Δf < 0, accept the new solution x' (i.e., set x = x').\n   d. If Δf ≥ 0, accept the new solution x' with probability exp(-Δf/T).\n   e. Update the temperature T = 0.95 * T.\n\nSince this is a probabilistic algorithm, the solution may not be the same every time. Here is a Python implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm for the given function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 3*x**2 - 9*x + 15\n\ndef simulated_annealing(T, cooling_rate, neighborhood_range):\n    x = random.uniform(-10, 10)\n    while T > 1e-6:\n        x_prime = x + random.uniform(-neighborhood_range, neighborhood_range)\n        delta_f = f(x_prime) - f(x)\n        if delta_f < 0 or random.random() < math.exp(-delta_f / T):\n            x = x_prime\n        T *= cooling_rate\n    return x, f(x)\n\nT = 1000\ncooling_rate = 0.95\nneighborhood_range = 0.1\n\nx_min, f_min = simulated_annealing(T, cooling_rate, neighborhood_range)\nprint(\"Global minimum at x =\", x_min, \"with f(x) =\", f_min)\n```\n\nRun the code multiple times to get different solutions, and choose the one with the lowest f(x) value as the global minimum. Note that the algorithm may not always find the exact global minimum, but it should provide a good approximation."
