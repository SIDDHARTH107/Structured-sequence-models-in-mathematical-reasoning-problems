    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter (d)\n\nIn this case, the diameter (d) is 50 cm. So, we can plug in the value into the formula:\n\nC = π * 50 cm\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 50 cm\n\nC ≈ 157.079 cm\n\nThe circumference of the wheel is approximately 157.079 cm."
