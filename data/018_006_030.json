    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, denoted as A', we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A.\n\nA' = { x ∈ U | x ∉ A }\n\nComparing the elements of U and A, we can find the elements that are not in A:\n\nA' = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∪ A' = U using set theory principles.\n\nLet x be an arbitrary element in U. We need to show that x ∈ A ∪ A' (i.e., x is in either A or A' or both).\n\nSince x is an element of U, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. x ∈ A: In this case, x is already in A, so x ∈ A ∪ A'.\n2. x ∉ A: In this case, x must be in A' (because A' contains all elements of U that are not in A). So, x ∈ A ∪ A'.\n\nIn both cases, x ∈ A ∪ A'. Since x was an arbitrary element of U, this shows that every element of U is in A ∪ A'. Therefore, A ∪ A' is a subset of U.\n\nNow, let's show that U is a subset of A ∪ A'. Let y be an arbitrary element in A ∪ A'. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. y ∈ A: In this case, y is already in U (since A is a subset of U).\n2. y ∈ A': In this case, y is also in U (since A' contains elements of U not in A).\n\nIn both cases, y ∈ U. Since y was an arbitrary element of A ∪ A', this shows that every element of A ∪ A' is in U. Therefore, U is a subset of A ∪ A'.\n\nSince A ∪ A' is a subset of U and U is a subset of A ∪ A', we can conclude that A ∪ A' = U."
