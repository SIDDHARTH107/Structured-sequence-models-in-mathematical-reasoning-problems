Let x be a point in X such that the fiber p^(-1)(x) has exactly 3 elements. Calculate the fundamental group of X at x.",
    "message_2": "Since E is simply connected, its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., π_1(E) = {e}. Let x ∈ X and let F = p^(-1)(x) be the fiber over x, which has exactly 3 elements. We want to compute the fundamental group π_1(X, x).\n\nBy the lifting criterion for covering spaces, given any loop f: [0, 1] → X based at x, there exists a unique lift ĝ: [0, 1] → E of f if and only if f_*(π_1([0, 1], 0)) ⊆ p_*(π_1(E, ĝ(0))). Since E is simply connected, its fundamental group is trivial, and thus p_*(π_1(E, ĝ(0))) = {e}. This means that there exists a unique lift ĝ of f if and only if f is null-homotopic.\n\nNow, consider the action of the fundamental group π_1(X, x) on the fiber F. Since X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, the action of π_1(X, x) on F is transitive. This means that for any two points y, z ∈ F, there exists an element g ∈ π_1(X, x) such that g.y = z.\n\nSince the fiber F has exactly 3 elements, the action of π_1(X, x) on F partitions π_1(X, x) into 3 cosets. Let G be the stabilizer of a point y ∈ F, i.e., G = {g ∈ π_1(X, x) | g.y = y}. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, we have |π_1(X, x)| = |G| * 3.\n\nNow, we claim that G is isomorphic to π_1(X, x). To see this, consider the restriction of the covering map p to the connected component of E containing y, say p': E' → X. Since E' is also simply connected, the same argument as before shows that the action of G on the fiber p'^(-1)(x) is transitive. Moreover, since the action of π_1(X, x) on F is transitive, it follows that p'^(-1)(x) = F. Therefore, the action of G on F is free, and we have a bijection between G and π_1(X, x) given by the action on F.\n\nThus, we have |π_1(X, x)| = |G| * 3, and since G is isomorphic to π_1(X, x), we have |π_1(X, x)| = |π_1(X, x)| * 3. This implies that |π_1(X, x)| = 3. Since X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, the fundamental group π_1(X, x) must be a discrete group with 3 elements. The only such group is the cyclic group of order 3, i.e., Z_3.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of X at x is π_1(X, x) ≅ Z_3."
