    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n  * 4x - 6y = 14\n\nWhich is the same as the second equation. This means that both equations represent the same line. Since they are the same line, there are infinitely many solutions for this system of linear equations. The system is dependent."
