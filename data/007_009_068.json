    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it counts the number of integers in the range [1, n] that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 with n.\n\nTo compute φ(n), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is:\n\n24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n\nNow, we can plug the prime factors into the formula:\n\nφ(24) = 24 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(24) = 24 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(24) = 12 * (2/3)\nφ(24) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function of 24 is 8."
