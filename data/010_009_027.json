    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nGiven a square with a side length of 2, construct a triangulation that consists of smaller triangles with sides of length 1. Calculate the total number of triangles in this triangulation.",
    "message_2": "To construct a triangulation with smaller triangles of side length 1, we can divide the square into four smaller squares, each with a side length of 1. Then, we can further divide each of these smaller squares into two right-angled triangles by drawing a diagonal.\n\nSo, for each of the four smaller squares, we get 2 triangles. Therefore, the total number of triangles in this triangulation is 4 * 2 = 8 triangles."
