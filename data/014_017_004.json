    "message_1": "In a ciphertext generated by a substitution cipher, the frequency of the letter 'E' is found to be 0.20. Assuming that 'E' is the most frequent letter in English language, find the replacement of the letter 'E' and the corresponding frequency in the plaintext.",
    "message_2": "To find the replacement of the letter 'E' and the corresponding frequency in the plaintext, we need to analyze the frequency distribution of the letters in the ciphertext. Since we know that 'E' is the most frequent letter in the English language, we can assume that the letter with the highest frequency in the ciphertext is the replacement for 'E'.\n\nHowever, without any information about the frequency distribution of the other letters in the ciphertext, it is impossible to determine the exact replacement of the letter 'E' and the corresponding frequency in the plaintext.\n\nIf you can provide the frequency distribution of the letters in the ciphertext, I can help you find the replacement of the letter 'E' and the corresponding frequency in the plaintext."
