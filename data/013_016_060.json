    "message_1": "Consider a principal who hires an agent to perform a task. The agent's effort can either be \"high\" (H) or \"low\" (L), resulting in a payoff of $10H$ or $5L$ for the principal. However, the agent will only put in high effort if the wage offered by the principal is at least $w$. The agent's reservation wage is $r$, where $r < w$. If the principal offers a wage of $w = 8$, what effort level will the agent choose?",
    "message_2": "Since the wage offered by the principal ($w = 8$) is greater than the agent's reservation wage ($r < w$), the agent will choose to put in high effort (H). This is because the agent's condition for putting in high effort is met, as the wage offered is at least $w$."
