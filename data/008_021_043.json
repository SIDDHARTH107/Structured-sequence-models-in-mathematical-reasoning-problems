    "message_2": "First, let's write down the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 1 -2 | 3 |\n| 2 -4 | 6 |\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to attempt to get the matrix into its row-echelon form. We can start by eliminating the 2 in the second row, first column. To do this, we can subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n| 1 -2 |  3 |\n| 0  0 |  0 |\n\nNow, the matrix is in its row-echelon form. Notice that the second row is all zeros. This means that the coefficient matrix is singular, which means it does not have an inverse.\n\nA singular coefficient matrix implies that the system of linear equations is either inconsistent (no solution) or dependent (infinitely many solutions). In this case, since the second row of the augmented matrix is all zeros, it represents the equation 0x + 0y = 0, which is always true. This means that the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.\n\nIn other words, the given system of linear equations does not have a unique solution, and any multiple of the first equation will satisfy the second equation as well."
