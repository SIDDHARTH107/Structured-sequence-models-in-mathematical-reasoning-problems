    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30, we first note that 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, which is a product of distinct prime numbers. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 30.\n\nLet G be a group of order 30. By Sylow's theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 10 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, we consider the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since they are all normal, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5. This gives us the group Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_30.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both of which are normal. G is then isomorphic to the semidirect product (P_2 × P_3) ⋊ P_5. Since P_3 and P_5 are both normal, we have G isomorphic to (Z_2 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_5. The only nontrivial action of Z_5 on Z_2 × Z_3 is given by the automorphism that sends (1, 0) to (1, 1) and (0, 1) to (0, 2). This gives us the group Z_10 ⋊ Z_3, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_15.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both of which are normal. G is then isomorphic to the semidirect product P_2 ⋊ (P_3 × P_5). Since P_2 and P_5 are both normal, we have G isomorphic to Z_2 ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_5). However, this case is not possible, as there is no nontrivial action of Z_2 on Z_3 × Z_5.\n\nThus, there are two distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30:\n\n1. The cyclic group Z_30.\n2. The dihedral group D_15."
