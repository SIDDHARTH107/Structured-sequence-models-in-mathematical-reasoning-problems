    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges in which every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex.\n\nIn this graph, the maximum number of edges that can be selected to create a perfect matching is 2. One possible perfect matching is the set of edges {A-C, B-E}. Another possible perfect matching is the set of edges {A-D, B-E}."
