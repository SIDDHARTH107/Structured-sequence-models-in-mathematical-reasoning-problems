    "message_1": "A wire of length 25 meters is cut into two pieces. One piece is bent in the shape of a circle and the other is bent into the shape of a square. Find the maximum total area that can be enclosed by the two shapes.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the wire used to form the circle as x meters, and the length of the wire used to form the square as (25 - x) meters. \n\nThe circumference of the circle is x meters, so we can write the radius of the circle as r = x / (2 * pi). The area of the circle is given by the formula A_circle = pi * r^2.\n\nThe perimeter of the square is (25 - x) meters, so we can write the side length of the square as s = (25 - x) / 4. The area of the square is given by the formula A_square = s^2.\n\nThe total area enclosed by the two shapes is the sum of the areas of the circle and the square: A_total = A_circle + A_square.\n\nTo find the maximum total area, we need to find the maximum value of A_total with respect to x. To do this, we will differentiate A_total with respect to x and set the derivative equal to zero, then solve for x.\n\nFirst, let's express A_total in terms of x:\n\nA_total = pi * (x / (2 * pi))^2 + ((25 - x) / 4)^2\n\nA_total = (x^2 / (4 * pi)) + ((25 - x)^2 / 16)\n\nNow, let's differentiate A_total with respect to x:\n\nd(A_total) / dx = (2 * x / (4 * pi)) - (2 * (25 - x) / 16)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nd(A_total) / dx = (x / (2 * pi)) - ((25 - x) / 8)\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero and solving for x:\n\n0 = (x / (2 * pi)) - ((25 - x) / 8)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 8 * 2 * pi to eliminate the fractions:\n\n0 = 8 * x * pi - 2 * pi * (25 - x)\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n0 = 8 * pi * x - 50 * pi + 2 * pi * x\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n0 = 10 * pi * x - 50 * pi\n\nDividing both sides by 10 * pi:\n\nx = 5\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the maximum total area:\n\nA_total = (5^2 / (4 * pi)) + ((25 - 5)^2 / 16)\n\nA_total = (25 / (4 * pi)) + (20^2 / 16)\n\nA_total = (25 / (4 * pi)) + 100\n\nThe maximum total area that can be enclosed by the two shapes is (25 / (4 * pi)) + 100 square meters."
