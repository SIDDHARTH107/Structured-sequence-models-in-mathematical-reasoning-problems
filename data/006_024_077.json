    "message_1": "A travel agency found that the probability of a customer cancelling a flight is 0.15. If the agency books 50 customers for a flight, what is the probability that at least 5 customers will cancel their flight?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, k cancelled flights)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 50 customers)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, cancelled flights)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.15)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.85)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 5 customers will cancel their flight, which means we need to find the probability of 5, 6, 7, ..., 50 cancellations. To do this, we can find the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 cancellations and subtract that from 1 (the total probability).\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\n\nP(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nThen, we'll subtract this from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 cancellations:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X < 5)\n\nNow, we'll calculate the individual probabilities using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * 0.15^0 * 0.85^50 ≈ 0.000002\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * 0.15^1 * 0.85^49 ≈ 0.000045\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * 0.15^2 * 0.85^48 ≈ 0.00045\nP(X = 3) = C(50, 3) * 0.15^3 * 0.85^47 ≈ 0.0024\nP(X = 4) = C(50, 4) * 0.15^4 * 0.85^46 ≈ 0.0089\n\nNow, we'll add these probabilities together:\n\nP(X < 5) = 0.000002 + 0.000045 + 0.00045 + 0.0024 + 0.0089 ≈ 0.0118\n\nFinally, we'll subtract this from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 cancellations:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - 0.0118 ≈ 0.9882\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 customers will cancel their flight is approximately 0.9882 or 98.82%."
