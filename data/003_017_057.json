    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 2sin(x), and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] 2sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 2sin(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫2sin(x) dx = -2cos(x) + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\n-2cos(π) - (-2cos(0)) = -2(-1) - (-2(1)) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nNow, we'll plug this back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 4 = 4/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) on the interval [0, π] is 4/π."
