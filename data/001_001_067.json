    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Add x to both sides of the equation to isolate the x terms on one side:\n2x + x + 7 = 15 - x + x\n\n3x + 7 = 15\n\n2. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to isolate the x term:\n3x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7\n\n3x = 8\n\n3. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:\n3x / 3 = 8 / 3\n\nx = 8/3"
