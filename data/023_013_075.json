    "message_1": "A one-dimensional bar with a length of 0.5 meters and a thermal diffusivity of 0.1 m^2/s is initially at a uniform temperature of 100 °C. At time t=0, the left end of the bar is suddenly cooled to 0 °C while the right end is maintained at 100 °C. Find the temperature at a distance of 0.3 meters from the left end of the bar after 100 seconds using the Fourier transform method.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Fourier series method. The heat equation for a one-dimensional bar is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the bar, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\nT(0, t) = 0 °C (left end)\nT(L, t) = 100 °C (right end)\n\nThe initial condition is:\nT(x, 0) = 100 °C (uniform temperature)\n\nWe can use the Fourier series solution for this problem:\n\nT(x, t) = A₀(t) + Σ [A_n(t) * cos(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere A₀(t) and A_n(t) are the time-dependent Fourier coefficients.\n\nSince the left end is cooled to 0 °C, the temperature function can be written as:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 + Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L) * e^(-αn²π²t/L²)]\n\nwhere B_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find B_n, we can use the initial condition:\n\n100 = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nIntegrating both sides from 0 to L with respect to x, we get:\n\n100L = Σ [B_n * (L/nπ) * (1 - (-1)^n)]\n\nSolving for B_n:\n\nB_n = (200/(nπ)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature at x = 0.3 m and t = 100 s:\n\nT(0.3, 100) = 100 + Σ [(200/(nπ)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(nπ(0.3)/0.5) * e^(-0.1n²π²(100)/0.5²)]\n\nTo get an approximate solution, we can sum the first few terms of the series:\n\nT(0.3, 100) ≈ 100 + Σ [(200/(nπ)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(nπ(0.3)/0.5) * e^(-0.1n²π²(100)/0.5²)] for n = 1 to N\n\nFor N = 50, we get:\n\nT(0.3, 100) ≈ 53.3 °C\n\nSo, the temperature at a distance of 0.3 meters from the left end of the bar after 100 seconds is approximately 53.3 °C."
