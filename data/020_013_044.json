    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's define the Lagrangian function L(x, λ) as follows:\n\nL(x, λ) = x' * A * x - λ * (x' * b - 1)\n\nwhere λ is the Lagrange multiplier. To find the optimal solution, we need to find the gradient of L with respect to x and λ and set them equal to zero:\n\n∇xL = 2 * A * x - λ * b = 0\n∇λL = x' * b - 1 = 0\n\nNow we can rewrite the first equation as:\n\nA * x = (λ/2) * b\n\nSince A is a symmetric matrix, we can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalues of A are:\n\nλ₁ = 6, λ₂ = 4, λ₃ = 1\n\nwith corresponding eigenvectors:\n\nv₁ = [ 1/√2,  1/√2,  0    ]\nv₂ = [-1/√2,  1/√2,  0    ]\nv₃ = [ 0,      0,     1    ]\n\nNow we can express x as a linear combination of the eigenvectors:\n\nx = α₁ * v₁ + α₂ * v₂ + α₃ * v₃\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation A * x = (λ/2) * b, we get:\n\n(λ/2) * b = α₁ * λ₁ * v₁ + α₂ * λ₂ * v₂ + α₃ * λ₃ * v₃\n\nNow we can solve for α₁, α₂, and α₃:\n\nα₁ = (λ/12) * (1 + √2)\nα₂ = (λ/12) * (1 - √2)\nα₃ = (λ/2) * 3\n\nNow we need to find λ such that x' * b = 1 and x >= 0. Substituting the expression for x into the constraint x' * b = 1, we get:\n\n(α₁ * v₁ + α₂ * v₂ + α₃ * v₃)' * b = 1\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 4/3\n\nNow we can find the optimal solution x:\n\nx = α₁ * v₁ + α₂ * v₂ + α₃ * v₃\nx = (1/3) * [ 1/√2, 1/√2, 0 ] + (1/9) * [-1/√2, 1/√2, 0 ] + (2/3) * [ 0, 0, 1 ]\nx = [ 1/9, 5/9, 2/3 ]\n\nSo the optimal solution for the given optimization problem is x = [ 1/9, 5/9, 2/3 ]."
