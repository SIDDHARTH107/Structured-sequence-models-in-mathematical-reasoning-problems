    "message_2": "The abductive inference in this case would be to identify the pattern in the given series and then predict the next number based on that pattern. The series is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2 between each consecutive term. Therefore, the missing number in the series would be 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\na) 10"
