    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, f is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nWe are given that v = 7 and e = 10. We need to find the maximum number of faces, f, that the graph can have. According to the Handshaking lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nÎ£(deg(v)) = 2e\n\nSince the graph has 7 vertices, the maximum degree for each vertex is 6. However, if all vertices have a degree of 6, the sum of the degrees would be 42, which is greater than 2e (20). Therefore, not all vertices can have a degree of 6.\n\nLet's assume that 6 vertices have a degree of 5, and the remaining vertex has a degree of 4. The sum of the degrees would then be:\n\n6 * 5 + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34\n\nSince 34 is equal to 2e (20), this configuration is possible. In this case, the graph is a maximal planar graph, meaning that adding any more edges would make it non-planar. For a maximal planar graph, the number of faces can be determined using the formula:\n\nf = e - v + 2\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nf = 10 - 7 + 2 = 5\n\nNow we can use Euler's formula to find the genus of the graph:\n\n7 - 10 + 5 = 2 - 2g\n\n2 = 2 - 2g\n\ng = 0\n\nTherefore, the genus of the graph is 0, meaning it is a planar graph."
