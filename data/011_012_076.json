    "message_2": "To find out how many students do not like either chocolate or vanilla cake, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal students liking chocolate or vanilla cake = (Students liking chocolate cake) + (Students liking vanilla cake) - (Students liking both chocolate and vanilla cake)\n\nTotal students liking chocolate or vanilla cake = 15 + 18 - 10 = 23\n\nNow, we can find out how many students do not like either chocolate or vanilla cake by subtracting the total students liking chocolate or vanilla cake from the total number of students in the class.\n\nStudents not liking either chocolate or vanilla cake = (Total students in the class) - (Total students liking chocolate or vanilla cake)\n\nStudents not liking either chocolate or vanilla cake = 30 - 23 = 7\n\nSo, 7 students in the class do not like either chocolate or vanilla cake."
