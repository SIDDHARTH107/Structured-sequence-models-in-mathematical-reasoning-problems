    "message_2": "Proof 1: X is connected.\n\nAssume for contradiction that X is not connected. Then X can be written as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets A and B, i.e., X = A ∪ B with A ∩ B = ∅.\n\nNow, consider the sets f(A) and g(B). Since f and g are continuous, f(A) and g(B) are open in Y. Also, f(A) ∪ g(B) = Y, because for any x in X, either x is in A or x is in B, and thus either f(x) is in f(A) or g(x) is in g(B).\n\nNow, we claim that f(A) ∩ g(B) = ∅. Suppose there exists y in f(A) ∩ g(B). Then there exist a in A and b in B such that f(a) = y and g(b) = y. But this contradicts the assumption that f(x) ≠ g(x) for all x in X, since f(a) = g(b). Therefore, f(A) ∩ g(B) = ∅.\n\nWe have shown that Y can be written as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets f(A) and g(B), which contradicts the assumption that Y is connected. This contradiction implies that X must be connected.\n\nProof 2: f(X) is connected.\n\nLet X be a path-connected space, and let f: X to Y be a continuous function. To show that f(X) is connected, we will show that for any two points y1 and y2 in f(X), there exists a continuous function h: [0, 1] to f(X) such that h(0) = y1 and h(1) = y2.\n\nSince y1 and y2 are in f(X), there exist x1 and x2 in X such that f(x1) = y1 and f(x2) = y2. Since X is path-connected, there exists a continuous function p: [0, 1] to X such that p(0) = x1 and p(1) = x2.\n\nNow, define the function h: [0, 1] to f(X) by h(t) = f(p(t)) for all t in [0, 1]. Since f and p are continuous, h is also continuous. Moreover, h(0) = f(p(0)) = f(x1) = y1 and h(1) = f(p(1)) = f(x2) = y2.\n\nThus, for any two points y1 and y2 in f(X), there exists a continuous function h connecting them. This implies that f(X) is connected."
