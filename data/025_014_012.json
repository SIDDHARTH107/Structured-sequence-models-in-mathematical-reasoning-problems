    "message_1": "A math student is asked to find the value of a particular theta function at a given point. The theta function is defined according to the following equation:\n\nθ(z) = ∑_{n=-∞}^{∞} e^{iπn^2z}\n\nThe point at which the theta function is to be evaluated is z = (1+i)/2. What is the value of θ(z) at this point?",
    "message_2": "To find the value of the theta function at z = (1+i)/2, we can plug this value into the equation:\n\nθ((1+i)/2) = ∑_{n=-∞}^{∞} e^{iπn^2((1+i)/2)}\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this is an infinite series, and finding an exact value for it can be quite challenging. In practice, we would typically approximate the value by considering a finite number of terms in the series. The more terms we include, the more accurate our approximation will be.\n\nFor example, let's consider the first 100 terms of the series (from n = -50 to n = 50):\n\nθ((1+i)/2) ≈ ∑_{n=-50}^{50} e^{iπn^2((1+i)/2)}\n\nBy calculating the sum of these terms, we can obtain an approximation for the value of the theta function at z = (1+i)/2. Keep in mind that this is just an approximation, and the actual value would require considering an infinite number of terms."
