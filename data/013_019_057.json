However, there is a 50% chance that the project will fail and the company will lose the entire investment. The company can pay an expert to give them advice on whether the project is likely to succeed or fail, but there is a 40% chance that the expert is not trustworthy and will give them bad advice. \n\nAssuming the company communicates honestly with the expert, what is the maximum amount the company should pay for the expert's advice to make it worth paying for the advice, taking into account the probability of success or failure of the project, and the possibility of the expert giving bad advice?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the expected value of the project without the expert's advice:\n\nExpected value (no advice) = (Probability of success * Earnings if successful) - (Probability of failure * Loss if failed)\nExpected value (no advice) = (0.5 * $300,000) - (0.5 * $100,000)\nExpected value (no advice) = $150,000 - $50,000\nExpected value (no advice) = $100,000\n\nNow, let's consider the expert's advice. We have four possible scenarios:\n\n1. The expert is trustworthy and the project is successful.\n2. The expert is trustworthy and the project fails.\n3. The expert is not trustworthy and the project is successful.\n4. The expert is not trustworthy and the project fails.\n\nLet's assume that if the expert is trustworthy, they will always give correct advice. So, if the expert advises to invest, the project will be successful, and if they advise not to invest, the project will fail.\n\nWe can now calculate the expected value with the expert's advice:\n\nExpected value (advice) = (Probability of trustworthy expert * Probability of success * Earnings if successful) - (Probability of trustworthy expert * Probability of failure * Loss if failed) + (Probability of untrustworthy expert * Expected value without advice)\nExpected value (advice) = (0.6 * 1 * $300,000) - (0.6 * 0 * $100,000) + (0.4 * $100,000)\nExpected value (advice) = $180,000 + $40,000\nExpected value (advice) = $220,000\n\nNow, we can find the maximum amount the company should pay for the expert's advice:\n\nMaximum payment for advice = Expected value (advice) - Expected value (no advice)\nMaximum payment for advice = $220,000 - $100,000\nMaximum payment for advice = $120,000\n\nSo, the maximum amount the company should pay for the expert's advice is $120,000."
