    "message_2": "To find the sine, cosine, and tangent values for a 60-degree angle, we can use the unit circle and the properties of special right triangles, specifically the 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2. Let's consider a 30-60-90 triangle with a hypotenuse of length 1 (which corresponds to the radius of the unit circle). Then, the side lengths are:\n\n- Opposite side (opposite the 60-degree angle) = 1/2\n- Adjacent side (adjacent to the 60-degree angle) = √3/2\n\nNow, we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent values for the 60-degree angle:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of 60 degrees:\nsin(60) = opposite side / hypotenuse = (1/2) / 1 = 1/2\n\n2. Cosine (cos) of 60 degrees:\ncos(60) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = (√3/2) / 1 = √3/2\n\n3. Tangent (tan) of 60 degrees:\ntan(60) = opposite side / adjacent side = (1/2) / (√3/2) = 1/√3 = √3/3 (after rationalizing the denominator)\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent values for a 60-degree angle are:\n\nsin(60) = 1/2\ncos(60) = √3/2\ntan(60) = √3/3"
