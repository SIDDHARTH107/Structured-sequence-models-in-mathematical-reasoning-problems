    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 50 cm and cross-sectional area of 1 cm² is initially at a temperature of 100°C. The two ends of the rod are in contact with a thermal reservoir at a temperature of 0°C. Assuming that heat transfer occurs only in the axial direction and that the rod is in a steady state, use the Fourier transform method to determine the temperature distribution along the rod.",
    "message_2": "To determine the temperature distribution along the rod, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂²T/∂x² = 0\n\nwhere T is the temperature and x is the position along the rod.\n\nSince the rod is in a steady state, the temperature distribution will not change with time, and the equation becomes a simple second-order differential equation.\n\nWe can solve this equation by integrating twice:\n\n∂T/∂x = C1\nT(x) = C1x + C2\n\nNow we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the constants C1 and C2. The boundary conditions are:\n\n1. T(0) = 0°C (temperature at the left end of the rod)\n2. T(50) = 0°C (temperature at the right end of the rod)\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n\n0 = C1(0) + C2\nC2 = 0\n\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n\n0 = C1(50) + 0\nC1 = 0\n\nSo, the temperature distribution along the rod is:\n\nT(x) = 0\n\nHowever, this result contradicts the initial condition that the rod is initially at a temperature of 100°C. This is because the problem statement is not physically consistent. If the rod is initially at 100°C and both ends are in contact with a 0°C reservoir, the rod will not be in a steady state, and the temperature distribution will change with time.\n\nTo obtain a physically consistent solution, we would need to consider the transient heat conduction equation and solve it using the Fourier series method."
