    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the following kinematic equations:\n\n1. v = u + at\n2. s = ut + (1/2)at^2\n3. v^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\n- v is the final velocity\n- u is the initial velocity\n- a is the acceleration (due to gravity in this case, which is -9.8 m/s^2)\n- t is the time\n- s is the displacement (height in this case)\n\nAt the maximum height, the final velocity (v) will be 0 m/s. We can use the first equation to find the time it takes to reach the maximum height:\n\n0 = 20 + (-9.8)t\n9.8t = 20\nt = 20/9.8\nt ≈ 2.04 seconds\n\nNow, we can use the second equation to find the maximum height (s):\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at^2\ns = (20)(2.04) + (1/2)(-9.8)(2.04)^2\ns = 40.8 - 20.4(2.04)\ns ≈ 20.4 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height the object will reach is approximately 20.4 meters, and it will take about 2.04 seconds to reach that height."
