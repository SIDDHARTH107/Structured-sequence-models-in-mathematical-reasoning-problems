    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) = 2sin(x), and the interval is [0, pi]. So, a = 0 and b = pi.\n\nAverage value = (1/(pi-0)) * ∫[0, pi] 2sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 2sin(x) from 0 to pi:\n\n∫[0, pi] 2sin(x) dx = [-2cos(x)] from 0 to pi (since the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x))\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds:\n\n[-2cos(pi)] - [-2cos(0)] = (-2 * -1) - (-2 * 1) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nNow, we plug this back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(pi-0)) * 4 = 4/pi\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) on the interval [0, pi] is 4/pi."
