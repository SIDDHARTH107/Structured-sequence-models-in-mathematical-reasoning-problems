    "message_2": "To compute the Hilbert series $H(R/I, t)$, we first need to understand the structure of the quotient ring $R/I$. We have the following relations in the ring $R$:\n\n1. $xy = y^2x$.\n\nNow, let's consider the ideal $I = (x)R$. This means that every element in $I$ is of the form $xr$ for some $r \\in R$. \n\nWe want to find a basis for the $k$-vector space $R/I$. Notice that since $I$ is generated by $x$, the elements of $R/I$ can be represented as polynomials in $y$ with coefficients in $k$. Thus, a natural basis for $R/I$ is given by the set $\\{1, y, y^2, y^3, \\dots\\}$.\n\nNow, let's compute the Hilbert series $H(R/I, t)$. The Hilbert series is a generating function that counts the dimensions of the graded components of the $k$-vector space $R/I$. In our case, the graded components are given by the powers of $y$. \n\nFor each $n \\geq 0$, the dimension of the $n$-th graded component is the number of basis elements of the form $y^n$, which is just 1. Therefore, the Hilbert series is given by the following power series:\n\n$H(R/I, t) = 1 + t + t^2 + t^3 + \\dots$\n\nThis is a geometric series with common ratio $t$. We can find its sum using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n$H(R/I, t) = \\frac{1}{1 - t}$"
