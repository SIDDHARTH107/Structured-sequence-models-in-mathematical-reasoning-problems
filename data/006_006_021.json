    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x successes in n trials\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10 free throws)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, 8 successful free throws)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 85% or 0.85)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, 15% or 0.15)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated using the formula: n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCx:\nn = 10\nx = 8\nnCx = 10! / (8! * (10-8)!)\nnCx = 10! / (8! * 2!)\nnCx = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\nnCx = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\nnCx = 45\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\nP(8) = 45 * (0.85^8) * (0.15^2)\n\nP(8) = 45 * 0.275 * 0.0225\nP(8) â‰ˆ 0.2759\n\nSo, the probability of the basketball player making exactly 8 out of 10 free throws given their average success rate is 85% is approximately 27.59%."
