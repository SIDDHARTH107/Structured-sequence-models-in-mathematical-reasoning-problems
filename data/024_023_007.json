    "message_2": "The torus is a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle of radius 1 (smaller radius) around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance of 2 (larger radius) from the circle's center. The equation given, `(sqrt(x^2+y^2)-2)^2+z^2=1`, describes this torus in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nTo determine the symmetries of the torus, we need to find the transformations that map the torus onto itself. There are several types of symmetries for the torus:\n\n1. Rotational symmetry: The torus has rotational symmetry around the z-axis. Any rotation around the z-axis by an angle θ will map the torus onto itself. Mathematically, this can be represented as the transformation (x, y, z) → (x cos(θ) - y sin(θ), x sin(θ) + y cos(θ), z).\n\n2. Translational symmetry: The torus has translational symmetry along its central circular axis (the z-axis). If we \"unwrap\" the torus along this axis, we can see that it is periodic with a period equal to the circumference of the central circle, which is 4π. Mathematically, this can be represented as the transformation (x, y, z) → (x, y, z + 4πn), where n is an integer.\n\n3. Reflection symmetry: The torus has reflection symmetry with respect to the xy-plane (z = 0). If we reflect the torus across this plane, it will map onto itself. Mathematically, this can be represented as the transformation (x, y, z) → (x, y, -z).\n\nThese are the main symmetries of the torus described by the given equation. Note that there are no symmetries that involve scaling or shearing, as these would change the shape of the torus and not map it onto itself."
