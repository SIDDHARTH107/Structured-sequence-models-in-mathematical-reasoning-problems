    "message_2": "To find the lowest frequency associated with the electron's motion in the box, we first need to determine the lowest energy state of the electron. In a one-dimensional box, the energy levels are quantized according to the formula:\n\nE_n = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), and L is the width of the box (2 x 10^-9 m).\n\nFor the lowest energy state, n = 1. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE_1 = (1^2 * (6.626 x 10^-34)^2) / (8 * (9.109 x 10^-31) * (2 x 10^-9)^2)\nE_1 = 6.024 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can find the frequency associated with this energy using the formula:\n\nf = E / h\n\nf = (6.024 x 10^-19 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nf = 9.09 x 10^14 Hz\n\nThe lowest frequency associated with the electron's motion in the box is 9.09 x 10^14 Hz.\n\nNow, let's find the wave function of the electron in position space using the Fourier transform. The wave function of an electron in a one-dimensional box is given by:\n\nΨ(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(n * π * x / L)\n\nFor the lowest energy state (n = 1), the wave function is:\n\nΨ(x) = sqrt(2/(2 x 10^-9)) * sin(π * x / (2 x 10^-9))\n\nΨ(x) = sqrt(10^9) * sin(π * x / (2 x 10^-9))\n\nThis is the wave function of the electron in position space for the lowest energy state in a one-dimensional box of width 2 nm."
