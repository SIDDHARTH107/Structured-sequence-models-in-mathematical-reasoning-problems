    "message_1": "A company wants to secure its data using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Given the public key Q=(5, 1), the message M=11, and the generator point G=(2, 2), find the corresponding ciphertext. Use the equation, C = M*Q, where * represents scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext C, we need to perform scalar multiplication of the message M with the public key Q on the elliptic curve. \n\nGiven:\nQ = (5, 1)\nM = 11\nG = (2, 2)\n\nFirst, we need to find the elliptic curve equation. Since we have the generator point G, we can use it to find the equation. The general equation for an elliptic curve is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + ax + b (mod p)\n\nWe need to find the values of a, b, and p. Since we don't have these values, we cannot proceed with the scalar multiplication and find the ciphertext C.\n\nHowever, if you provide the values of a, b, and p, we can proceed with the calculation."
