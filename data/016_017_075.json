    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the length of the curve at the nth iteration as L_n. The length of the initial line segment (n=0) is 1 unit, so L_0 = 1.\n\nWith each iteration, the length of the curve doubles. Therefore, the length of the curve at the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nL_n = L_0 * 2^n\n\nTo find the length of the 8th iteration (n=8), we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nL_8 = 1 * 2^8\nL_8 = 1 * 256\nL_8 = 256 units\n\nSo, the length of the 8th iteration of the Heighway Dragon curve is 256 units."
