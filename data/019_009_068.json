    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use proof by contradiction. We will assume that ~(P∧Q) holds, and (P∨Q) holds, and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that ~(P∧Q) holds, which means that it is not the case that both P and Q are true. In other words, either P is false, or Q is false, or both are false.\n\nNow, let's assume that (P∨Q) holds, which means that either P is true, or Q is true, or both are true.\n\nWe will now show that this leads to a contradiction:\n\n1. If P is true and Q is false, then (P∨Q) holds, but ~(P∧Q) also holds, since Q is false.\n2. If P is false and Q is true, then (P∨Q) holds, but ~(P∧Q) also holds, since P is false.\n3. If both P and Q are true, then (P∨Q) holds, but this contradicts our assumption that ~(P∧Q) holds, since both P and Q are true.\n\nIn all cases, we have a contradiction, which means that our assumption that (P∨Q) holds must be false. Therefore, if ~(P∧Q) holds, then ~(P∨Q) must also hold."
