Determine the electric potential inside and outside the sphere.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ and assume that the electric potential is only a function of the radial distance $r$, i.e., $\\phi = \\phi(r)$. This is because the charge distribution is spherically symmetric. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator is given by:\n\n$$\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(r^2 \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\\right)$$\n\nThe differential equation becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(r^2 \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\\right) = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n\nInside the sphere ($r < a$), the charge density is uniform, so $\\rho = \\rho_0$. The equation becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(r^2 \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\\right) = -\\frac{\\rho_0}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n\nIntegrating once with respect to $r$, we get:\n\n$$r^2 \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} = -\\frac{\\rho_0}{\\epsilon_0} \\frac{r^3}{3} + C_1$$\n\nIntegrating again, we obtain the electric potential inside the sphere:\n\n$$\\phi_{inside}(r) = -\\frac{\\rho_0}{6\\epsilon_0} r^2 + \\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2$$\n\nOutside the sphere ($r > a$), the charge density is zero, so the differential equation becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(r^2 \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\\right) = 0$$\n\nIntegrating once, we get:\n\n$$r^2 \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} = C_3$$\n\nIntegrating again, we obtain the electric potential outside the sphere:\n\n$$\\phi_{outside}(r) = -\\frac{C_3}{r} + C_4$$\n\nNow we need to find the constants $C_1, C_2, C_3,$ and $C_4$. To do this, we will use the boundary conditions. At the surface of the sphere ($r = a$), the electric potential must be continuous:\n\n$$\\phi_{inside}(a) = \\phi_{outside}(a)$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\rho_0}{6\\epsilon_0} a^2 + \\frac{C_1}{a} + C_2 = -\\frac{C_3}{a} + C_4$$\n\nThe electric field is given by the negative gradient of the electric potential:\n\n$$\\vec{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$$\n\nAt the surface of the sphere, the electric field must also be continuous. In spherical coordinates, the radial component of the electric field is given by:\n\n$$E_r = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}$$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\partial \\phi_{inside}}{\\partial r}\\Big|_{r=a} = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi_{outside}}{\\partial r}\\Big|_{r=a}$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\rho_0}{3\\epsilon_0} a + \\frac{C_1}{a^2} = \\frac{C_3}{a^2}$$\n\nNow we have two equations and four unknowns. However, we can use the fact that the total charge of the sphere is given by:\n\n$$Q = \\int_{sphere} \\rho dV = \\rho_0 \\int_{sphere} dV = \\rho_0 \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3$$\n\nThe electric field outside the sphere is equivalent to the electric field produced by a point charge $Q$ at the origin. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$E_{outside}(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2}$$\n\nSo, at $r = a$, we have:\n\n$$E_{outside}(a) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 a^2} = \\frac{\\rho_0 a}{3\\epsilon_0}$$\n\nUsing this condition, we can solve for $C_3$:\n\n$$C_3 = \\rho_0 a^3$$\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the equation for the electric potential outside the sphere:\n\n$$\\phi_{outside}(r) = -\\frac{\\rho_0 a^3}{\\epsilon_0 r} + C_4$$\n\nUsing the continuity condition for the electric potential at $r = a$, we can solve for $C_4$:\n\n$$C_4 = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{2\\epsilon_0}$$\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of $C_3$ and $C_4$ back into the equation for the electric potential inside the sphere:\n\n$$\\phi_{inside}(r) = -\\frac{\\rho_0}{6\\epsilon_0} r^2 + \\frac{\\rho_0 a^3}{\\epsilon_0 a} - \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{2\\epsilon_0}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\phi_{inside}(r) = \\frac{\\rho_0}{6\\epsilon_0}(3a^2 - r^2)$$\n\nSo, the electric potential inside the sphere is:\n\n$$\\phi_{inside}(r) = \\frac{\\rho_0}{6\\epsilon_0}(3a^2 - r^2)$$\n\nAnd the electric potential outside the sphere is:\n\n$$\\phi_{outside}(r) = -\\frac{\\rho_0 a^3}{\\epsilon_0 r} + \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{2\\epsilon_0}$$"
