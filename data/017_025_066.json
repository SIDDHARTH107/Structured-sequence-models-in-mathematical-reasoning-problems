    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C120, A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120, we will analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 2^3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 2^3 * 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 5, so n_5 can be 1, 6, or 24.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to C120.\nIf G is isomorphic to C120, then G is a cyclic group of order 120. In this case, there would be a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, so n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1. This is a possibility according to our earlier analysis.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2.\nIf G is isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2, then G is a direct product of the alternating group A5 of order 60 and a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2. In this case, n_2 = 15, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 6. This is also a possibility according to our earlier analysis.\n\nCase 3: G is one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\nIf G is one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120, then G is not a direct product of smaller groups. In this case, we cannot determine the exact values of n_2, n_3, and n_5, but we know that they must satisfy the conditions we found earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, without further information about G, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to C120, A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. However, we have shown that all three possibilities are consistent with the Sylow theorems and the given order of G."
