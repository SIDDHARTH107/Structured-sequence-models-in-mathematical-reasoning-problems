    "message_1": "I apologize, but I cannot create a precise numerical problem for deontic logic as it is a branch of logic that deals with ethical concepts, and its concepts do not lend themselves to numerical problems. However, I can provide a question that would require the student to apply their understanding of deontic logic.\n\nQuestion: John believes that it is morally obligatory to donate money to charity. Mary believes that it is not morally obligatory to donate money to charity. In this scenario, can both John and Mary be right at the same time? Why or why not?",
    "message_2": "In the scenario presented, both John and Mary can be right at the same time, depending on the ethical framework they are using to make their judgments. Deontic logic deals with the concepts of obligation, permission, and prohibition, but it does not dictate which ethical framework should be used to determine these concepts.\n\nFor example, John might be using a deontological ethical framework, which focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions, and believes that donating to charity is a moral duty. On the other hand, Mary might be using a consequentialist ethical framework, which focuses on the outcomes of actions, and believes that donating to charity is not morally obligatory because it depends on the specific consequences of donating in each situation.\n\nIn this case, both John and Mary can be right within their respective ethical frameworks, even though they have different views on the moral obligation of donating to charity. This highlights the importance of understanding the underlying ethical principles and frameworks when discussing and evaluating moral claims."
