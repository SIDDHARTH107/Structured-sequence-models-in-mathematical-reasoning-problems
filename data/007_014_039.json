    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). Perfect numbers can be represented by the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from the study of Mersenne primes.\n\nTo find the 7th perfect number, we need to find the first 7 pairs of prime numbers (p, 2^p - 1) that satisfy the formula.\n\n1. (2, 3): 2^(2-1) * (2^2 - 1) = 6\n2. (3, 7): 2^(3-1) * (2^3 - 1) = 28\n3. (5, 31): 2^(5-1) * (2^5 - 1) = 496\n4. (7, 127): 2^(7-1) * (2^7 - 1) = 8128\n5. (13, 8191): 2^(13-1) * (2^13 - 1) = 33,550,336\n6. (17, 131071): 2^(17-1) * (2^17 - 1) = 8,589,869,056\n7. (19, 524287): 2^(19-1) * (2^19 - 1) = 137,438,691,328\n\nThe 7th perfect number is 137,438,691,328."
