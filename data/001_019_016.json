    "message_2": "To solve for the absolute value of x, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero.\n5x - 20 = 30\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n5x = 50\nx = 10\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative.\n-(5x - 20) = 30\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n5x - 20 = -30\n5x = -10\nx = -2\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are 10 and -2."
