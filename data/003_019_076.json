    "message_2": "To find the integral of f(x) = 4cos(3x)dx, we first need to find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe antiderivative of 4cos(3x) with respect to x is:\n\n∫4cos(3x)dx = (4/3)sin(3x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this antiderivative at the given limits, x = 0 and x = π/6:\n\n[(4/3)sin(3(π/6))] - [(4/3)sin(3(0))]\n\n= (4/3)sin(π/2) - (4/3)sin(0)\n\n= (4/3)(1) - (4/3)(0)\n\n= 4/3\n\nSo, the integral of f(x) = 4cos(3x)dx from x = 0 to x = π/6 is 4/3."
