    "message_2": "An entire function is a function that is holomorphic (analytic) on the entire complex plane. The order of an entire function is a measure of its growth rate as the magnitude of the input variable z goes to infinity.\n\nThe order of an entire function is defined as:\n\nρ = lim (z→∞) sup (log|f(z)| / log|z|)\n\nwhere sup denotes the supremum (least upper bound) of the set.\n\nFor the given function f(z) = 3z^3 - 2z^2 + 3, we can see that it is a polynomial of degree 3. Polynomials are entire functions since they are holomorphic on the entire complex plane.\n\nTo find the order of f(z), we can look at the highest degree term, which is 3z^3. As z goes to infinity, the lower degree terms (2z^2 and 3) become insignificant compared to the highest degree term. Therefore, the growth rate of f(z) is determined by the term 3z^3.\n\nNow, let's compute the order:\n\nρ = lim (z→∞) sup (log|3z^3| / log|z|)\n\nSince the constant factor 3 does not affect the growth rate, we can ignore it:\n\nρ = lim (z→∞) sup (log|z^3| / log|z|)\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can simplify the expression:\n\nρ = lim (z→∞) sup (3 * log|z| / log|z|)\n\nThe log|z| terms cancel out:\n\nρ = lim (z→∞) sup (3)\n\nThe supremum of a constant value is just the constant itself:\n\nρ = 3\n\nSo, the order of the entire function f(z) = 3z^3 - 2z^2 + 3 is 3."
