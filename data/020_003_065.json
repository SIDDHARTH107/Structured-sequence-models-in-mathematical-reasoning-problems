Each unit of type A can be sold for $10, and each unit of type B can be sold for $12. The factory has a daily production capacity of 200 units. How many units of each type should the factory produce in order to maximize their profit for the day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A produced and y be the number of units of type B produced. We are given that the factory has a daily production capacity of 200 units, so:\n\nx + y = 200\n\nThe profit for each unit of type A is $10 - $5 = $5, and the profit for each unit of type B is $12 - $7 = $5. Therefore, the total profit P can be represented as:\n\nP = 5x + 5y\n\nWe want to maximize the profit, so we need to find the optimal values of x and y. Since the profit per unit is the same for both products, we can produce any combination of x and y that satisfies the production capacity constraint to achieve the maximum profit.\n\nLet's solve the production capacity constraint equation for y:\n\ny = 200 - x\n\nNow we can plug in different values of x and find the corresponding values of y:\n\n1. If the factory produces only type A products (x = 200), then y = 200 - 200 = 0. So, they produce 200 units of type A and 0 units of type B.\n\n2. If the factory produces only type B products (y = 200), then x = 200 - 200 = 0. So, they produce 0 units of type A and 200 units of type B.\n\n3. If the factory produces equal amounts of both products (x = 100), then y = 200 - 100 = 100. So, they produce 100 units of type A and 100 units of type B.\n\nAll of these combinations will result in the same maximum profit:\n\nP = 5x + 5y = 5(200) = $1000\n\nSo, the factory can produce any combination of type A and type B products that satisfy the production capacity constraint (x + y = 200) to achieve the maximum profit of $1000 per day."
