    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$, we will use the fact that $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) \\cong H^0(C, \\omega_C)$, where $\\omega_C$ is the canonical bundle of $C$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the canonical bundle $\\omega_C$. Recall that for a smooth curve $C$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial $F(x, y, z)$ of degree $d$, the canonical bundle is given by $\\omega_C \\cong \\mathcal{O}_C(d - 3)$. In our case, $C$ is a cubic curve, so $d = 3$. Therefore, the canonical bundle is $\\omega_C \\cong \\mathcal{O}_C(0)$, which is just the structure sheaf of $C$ itself.\n\nNow, we want to compute the dimension of $H^0(C, \\omega_C)$. Since $\\omega_C \\cong \\mathcal{O}_C(0)$, we have $H^0(C, \\omega_C) = H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(0))$. The global sections of $\\mathcal{O}_C(0)$ are just the constant functions on $C$. Since $C$ is a projective curve, it has only one connected component, so there is only one constant function on $C$. Therefore, the dimension of $H^0(C, \\omega_C)$ is 1.\n\nFinally, we have $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) \\cong H^0(C, \\omega_C)$, so the dimension of $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$ is also 1."
