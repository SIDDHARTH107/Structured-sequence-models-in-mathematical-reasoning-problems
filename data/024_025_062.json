    "message_2": "To compute the first Chern class $c_1(M)$ of the complex manifold $M$, we will use the adjunction formula. The adjunction formula relates the first Chern class of a hypersurface $M$ in a complex manifold $N$ to the first Chern class of $N$ and the divisor associated to the hypersurface. In our case, $M$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ given by the zero set of the polynomial $f(z_1, z_2, z_3)$. \n\nFirst, let's compute the first Chern class of $\\mathbb{C}^3$. Since $\\mathbb{C}^3$ is a complex vector space, it is a flat manifold, and its first Chern class is zero: $c_1(\\mathbb{C}^3) = 0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the divisor associated to the hypersurface $M$. The divisor is given by the zero set of a holomorphic function, which in our case is the polynomial $f(z_1, z_2, z_3)$. The degree of this polynomial is 3, so the divisor is of degree 3.\n\nThe adjunction formula states that:\n\n$c_1(M) = c_1(\\mathbb{C}^3) + (deg(D) - 1)[M]$\n\nwhere $[M]$ is the homology class of the hypersurface $M$. Since $c_1(\\mathbb{C}^3) = 0$, we have:\n\n$c_1(M) = (3 - 1)[M] = 2[M]$\n\nThus, the first Chern class of the complex manifold $M$ is $c_1(M) = 2[M]$."
