Let $Y$ be a closed 3-submanifold of $X$ such that $[Y] \\in H_3(X;\\mathbb{Z})$ is the Poincaré dual of a non-torsion element $\\alpha \\in H^2(X;\\mathbb{Z})$. Find the degree of the map $f: Y \\to S^3$, where $S^3$ is the 3-sphere with its usual orientation.",
    "message_2": "Since $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, we know that $X$ is a homology 3-sphere, i.e., $H_0(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(X;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, $H_2(X;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, and $H_3(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nNow, let's consider the map $f: Y \\to S^3$. Since $Y$ is a closed 3-submanifold of $X$, we have that $Y$ is also a homology 3-sphere. In particular, $H_3(Y;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nTo compute the degree of $f$, we need to look at the induced map on homology $f_*: H_3(Y;\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_3(S^3;\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_3(Y;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_3(S^3;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, the induced map $f_*$ is multiplication by some integer, say $n$. That is, $f_*(y) = ny$ for all $y \\in H_3(Y;\\mathbb{Z})$. The degree of $f$ is then defined to be this integer $n$.\n\nNow, let's use the fact that $[Y] \\in H_3(X;\\mathbb{Z})$ is the Poincaré dual of a non-torsion element $\\alpha \\in H^2(X;\\mathbb{Z})$. This means that the intersection product of $[Y]$ with any 2-cycle representing $\\alpha$ is non-zero. In particular, we have that $\\langle [Y], \\alpha \\rangle \\neq 0$.\n\nConsider the composition $g = f \\circ i: Y \\to X \\to S^3$, where $i: Y \\to X$ is the inclusion map. We have that $g_* = f_* \\circ i_*: H_3(Y;\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_3(S^3;\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $i_*$ is an isomorphism, we have that $g_* = f_*$, and thus the degree of $g$ is also $n$. \n\nNow, let's compute the intersection product of $[Y]$ with $\\alpha$ using the composition $g$. We have that $\\langle [Y], \\alpha \\rangle = \\langle g_*[Y], \\alpha \\rangle = \\langle n[Y], \\alpha \\rangle = n\\langle [Y], \\alpha \\rangle$. Since $\\langle [Y], \\alpha \\rangle \\neq 0$, we must have that $n = \\pm 1$. \n\nTherefore, the degree of the map $f: Y \\to S^3$ is either $1$ or $-1$."
