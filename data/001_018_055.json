    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation first. \n\n1. Combine the logarithms using the product rule: log_a(b) + log_a(c) = log_a(bc)\n   log base 3 of (27x^2) + log base 3 of (9x) = log base 3 of (27x^2 * 9x)\n\n2. Combine the logarithms using the quotient rule: log_a(b) - log_a(c) = log_a(b/c)\n   log base 3 of (27x^2 * 9x) - log base 3 of 81 = log base 3 of ((27x^2 * 9x) / 81)\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\nlog base 3 of ((27x^2 * 9x) / 81) = 4\n\n3. Remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation as powers of the base (3):\n\n(27x^2 * 9x) / 81 = 3^4\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n\n(27x^2 * 9x) / 81 = 81\n\n5. Multiply both sides by 81 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n27x^2 * 9x = 81 * 81\n\n6. Simplify the equation:\n\n243x^3 = 6561\n\n7. Divide both sides by 243:\n\nx^3 = 27\n\n8. Take the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution for x is 3."
