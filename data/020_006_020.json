    "message_1": "A meat processing plant produces two types of meat products: ground beef and sausage. It has 10,000 pounds of beef and 4,000 pounds of pork available. The production process for the ground beef requires 4 pounds of beef and 1 pound of pork per unit, while the production process for the sausage requires 2 pounds of beef and 3 pounds of pork per unit. The plant has a total of 4 production lines, each capable of producing up to 800 units of meat products per day.\n\nThe plant wants to maximize its profit. The profit from each unit of ground beef is $5, and the profit from each unit of sausage is $3. The question for the student to solve is:\nHow many units of ground beef and sausage should the plant produce with the available resources to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of ground beef and y be the number of units of sausage.\n\nThe constraints for the available resources are:\n\n1. Beef constraint: 4x + 2y ≤ 10,000\n2. Pork constraint: 1x + 3y ≤ 4,000\n3. Production line constraint: x + y ≤ 4 * 800 = 3,200\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 3y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\n1. y ≤ (10,000 - 4x) / 2\n2. y ≤ (4,000 - x) / 3\n3. y ≤ 3,200 - x\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by plotting these inequalities on a graph. The feasible region will be the intersection of all three inequalities.\n\nNext, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region. These are the points where the inequalities intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of (1) and (2): (10,000 - 4x) / 2 = (4,000 - x) / 3\n2. Intersection of (1) and (3): (10,000 - 4x) / 2 = 3,200 - x\n3. Intersection of (2) and (3): (4,000 - x) / 3 = 3,200 - x\n\nSolving these equations, we get the following vertices:\n\n1. (600, 2000)\n2. (1000, 2000)\n3. (1200, 800)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(600, 2000) = 5(600) + 3(2000) = 3,000 + 6,000 = 9,000\n2. P(1000, 2000) = 5(1000) + 3(2000) = 5,000 + 6,000 = 11,000\n3. P(1200, 800) = 5(1200) + 3(800) = 6,000 + 2,400 = 8,400\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (1000, 2000), with a profit of $11,000. Therefore, the plant should produce 1000 units of ground beef and 2000 units of sausage to maximize its profit."
