    "message_1": "Suppose a school has 200 students and the probability of a student passing their final math exam is 0.7. What is the probability that at least 140 students will pass their final math exam?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 140 students will pass their final math exam, we can use the binomial probability formula. However, calculating this directly for each case (140, 141, 142, ..., 200) would be tedious. Instead, we can find the probability that fewer than 140 students pass and subtract that from 1.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (students passing) out of n trials (total students)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (0.7 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (200 students)\n- k is the number of successes (140 or more students passing)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 140 students passing, so we can calculate the probability of fewer than 140 students passing and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X >= 140) = 1 - P(X < 140) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 139)]\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability for each value of k from 0 to 139 and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 140) = Σ [C(200, k) * (0.7)^k * (0.3)^(200-k)] for k = 0 to 139\n\nThis calculation is quite large and would be best done using software or a calculator with a built-in binomial probability function. Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X < 140) ≈ 0.0573\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 140 students passing:\n\nP(X >= 140) = 1 - P(X < 140) = 1 - 0.0573 ≈ 0.9427\n\nSo, the probability that at least 140 students will pass their final math exam is approximately 0.9427 or 94.27%."
