    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 12x + 4, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will give us the second derivative, f''(x).\n\n1. Find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 12x + 4)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x - 12\n\n2. Find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x^2 + 10x - 12)\nf''(x) = 12x + 10\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 2:\nf''(2) = 12(2) + 10\nf''(2) = 24 + 10\nf''(2) = 34\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 12x + 4 at x = 2 is 34."
