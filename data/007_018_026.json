    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes with a difference of at least 100, we need to find the first pair of primes that have a difference of 100 or more.\n\nWe can start by checking prime numbers and their differences:\n\n- The difference between 2 and 3 is 1.\n- The difference between 3 and 5 is 2.\n- The difference between 5 and 7 is 2.\n- The difference between 7 and 11 is 4.\n- The difference between 11 and 13 is 2.\n- The difference between 13 and 17 is 4.\n- The difference between 17 and 19 is 2.\n- The difference between 19 and 23 is 4.\n- The difference between 23 and 29 is 6.\n- The difference between 29 and 31 is 2.\n- The difference between 31 and 37 is 6.\n- The difference between 37 and 41 is 4.\n- The difference between 41 and 43 is 2.\n- The difference between 43 and 47 is 4.\n- The difference between 47 and 53 is 6.\n- The difference between 53 and 59 is 6.\n- The difference between 59 and 61 is 2.\n- The difference between 61 and 67 is 6.\n- The difference between 67 and 71 is 4.\n- The difference between 71 and 73 is 2.\n- The difference between 73 and 79 is 6.\n- The difference between 79 and 83 is 4.\n- The difference between 83 and 89 is 6.\n- The difference between 89 and 97 is 8.\n- The difference between 97 and 101 is 4.\n- The difference between 101 and 103 is 2.\n- The difference between 103 and 107 is 4.\n- The difference between 107 and 109 is 2.\n- The difference between 109 and 113 is 4.\n\nWe can continue this process, but it will take a long time to find the first pair of primes with a difference of at least 100. Instead, we can use a more efficient method to find the answer.\n\nUsing a prime number table or a prime number calculator, we can find that the first pair of consecutive primes with a difference of at least 100 is:\n\n- 370261 and 370373\n\nThe difference between these two prime numbers is:\n\n370373 - 370261 = 112\n\nSo, the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes with a difference of at least 100 is 112."
