    "message_1": "Suppose we are studying the lifetimes of light bulbs. We know that the probability of a bulb lasting at least 1000 hours is 0.8, and the probability of a bulb lasting at least 1500 hours is 0.6. What is the probability that a bulb lasts between 1000 and 1500 hours?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that a bulb lasts at least 1000 hours, and B be the event that a bulb lasts at least 1500 hours. We are given P(A) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.6. We want to find the probability of a bulb lasting between 1000 and 1500 hours, which is P(A) - P(B).\n\nSo, the probability that a bulb lasts between 1000 and 1500 hours is:\n\nP(A) - P(B) = 0.8 - 0.6 = 0.2\n\nTherefore, the probability that a bulb lasts between 1000 and 1500 hours is 0.2 or 20%."
