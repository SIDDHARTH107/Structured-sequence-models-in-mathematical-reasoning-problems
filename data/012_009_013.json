    "message_2": "In an undirected graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. Let's denote the number of edges as E.\n\nFrom the given degree sequence, we have:\n\n5 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + x = 2E\n\nNow, let's find the possible values of x.\n\nCase 1: x = 1\nThe degree sequence would be (5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1). The sum of the degrees is 23, which is odd. Since the sum of degrees must be even (2E), this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: x = 2\nThe degree sequence would be (5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2). The sum of the degrees is 24, which is even. So, we have:\n\n24 = 2E\nE = 12\n\nThere are 12 edges in the graph. This degree sequence is possible, and the graph can be constructed.\n\nCase 3: x > 2\nIf x > 2, the sum of the degrees will be greater than 24, which means there will be more than 12 edges. However, this would lead to some vertices having a degree greater than 5, which contradicts the given degree sequence.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for x is 2."
