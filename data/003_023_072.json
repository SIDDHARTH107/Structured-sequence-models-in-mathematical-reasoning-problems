    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry. The two vectors are vector A = [-3, 2, 5] and vector B = [4, -1, 2]. Find their cross product.",
    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the following formula:\n\nA x B = [A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y, A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z, A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x]\n\nwhere A_x, A_y, and A_z are the components of vector A, and B_x, B_y, and B_z are the components of vector B.\n\nGiven vector A = [-3, 2, 5] and vector B = [4, -1, 2], we can find the cross product as follows:\n\nA x B = [(2 * 2 - 5 * (-1)), (5 * 4 - (-3) * 2), (-3 * (-1) - 2 * 4)]\nA x B = [(4 + 5), (20 + 6), (3 - 8)]\nA x B = [9, 26, -5]\n\nSo, the cross product of vector A and vector B is [9, 26, -5]."
