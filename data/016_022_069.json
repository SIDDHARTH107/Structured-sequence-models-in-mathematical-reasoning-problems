    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal created by repeatedly removing tetrahedra from the initial pyramid. In this case, we start with a pyramid consisting of 4 triangles at the base.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 4. So, after 5 iterations, the total number of triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid can be calculated as follows:\n\nInitial triangles * (4^iterations) = 4 * (4^5) = 4 * 1024 = 4096 triangles."
