    "message_2": "To find the value of the financial derivative, we need to use the Black-Scholes formula for European call and put options. Since we are not given whether the derivative is a call or a put option, I will provide the value for both.\n\nThe Black-Scholes formula for a European call option is:\n\n$$C(S, t) = SN(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$$\n\nand for a European put option:\n\n$$P(S, t) = Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(-d_2) - SN(-d_1)$$\n\nwhere\n$$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln{\\frac{S}{K}} + (r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}$$\n$$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}$$\n\n$N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nGiven the parameters $S=100$, $K=110$, $T=0.5$, $\\sigma=0.2$, and $r=0.05$, we can calculate $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n\n$$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln{\\frac{100}{110}} + (0.05 + \\frac{0.2^2}{2})(0.5)}{0.2\\sqrt{0.5}} \\approx -0.4282$$\n$$d_2 = -0.4282 - 0.2\\sqrt{0.5} \\approx -0.6282$$\n\nNow, we can find the value of the call and put options:\n\n$$C(100, 0) = 100N(-0.4282) - 110e^{-0.05(0.5)}N(-0.6282) \\approx 2.86$$\n$$P(100, 0) = 110e^{-0.05(0.5)}N(0.6282) - 100N(0.4282) \\approx 7.96$$\n\nSo, the value of the financial derivative is approximately $2.86$ for a call option and $7.96$ for a put option."
