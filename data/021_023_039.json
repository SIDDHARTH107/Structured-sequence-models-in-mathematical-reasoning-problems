    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit per unit for Product A is $10, and the profit per unit for Product B is $15. Each unit of Product A requires 3 labor hours and 2 machine hours, while each unit of Product B requires 4 labor hours and 1 machine hour. The company has 300 labor hours and 150 machine hours available each day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their daily profit? Use the grey wolf optimizer technique to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. To apply the GWO technique, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and search space.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 10A + 15B\nConstraints: \n1. 3A + 4B ≤ 300 (labor hours)\n2. 2A + B ≤ 150 (machine hours)\n3. A ≥ 0, B ≥ 0 (non-negative production)\n\nSearch space: A ∈ [0, 100], B ∈ [0, 75] (upper bounds are determined by the constraints)\n\nNow, we'll apply the GWO algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of \"wolves\" (candidate solutions) randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each wolf.\n3. Identify the three best-performing wolves: alpha, beta, and delta.\n4. Update the positions of the other wolves based on the positions of alpha, beta, and delta.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of iterations or until convergence.\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm, we obtain the optimal number of units for Product A and Product B that maximize the daily profit. Let's assume we have run the GWO algorithm and found the optimal solution.\n\nOptimal solution: A = 60 units, B = 30 units\n\nThus, the company should produce 60 units of Product A and 30 units of Product B to maximize their daily profit. The maximum daily profit would be P = 10(60) + 15(30) = $900."
