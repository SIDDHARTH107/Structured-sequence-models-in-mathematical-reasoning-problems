    "message_2": "To compute the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols are given by the following formula:\n\nΓᵏᵢⱼ = (1/2) gᵏˡ ( ∂ᵢgⱼˡ + ∂ⱼgᵢˡ - ∂ˡgᵢⱼ )\n\nwhere gᵏˡ is the inverse metric tensor, and ∂ᵢ, ∂ⱼ, and ∂ˡ are partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates xᵢ, xⱼ, and xˡ, respectively.\n\nFor the given metric g = 3(dx² + dy²) + 5dz², we have the metric tensor components:\n\ng₁₁ = 3, g₂₂ = 3, g₃₃ = 5\ng₁₂ = g₁₃ = g₂₁ = g₂₃ = g₃₁ = g₃₂ = 0\n\nThe inverse metric tensor components are:\n\ng¹¹ = 1/3, g²² = 1/3, g³³ = 1/5\ng¹² = g¹³ = g²¹ = g²³ = g³¹ = g³² = 0\n\nNow we can compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric is diagonal, many terms will be zero. We only need to compute the non-zero terms:\n\nΓ¹₁₁ = (1/2) g¹¹ ( ∂₁g₁₁ + ∂₁g₁₁ - ∂₁g₁₁ ) = 0\nΓ¹₂₂ = (1/2) g¹¹ ( ∂₁g₂₂ + ∂₂g₁₂ - ∂₂g₁₂ ) = 0\nΓ¹₃₃ = (1/2) g¹¹ ( ∂₁g₃₃ + ∂₃g₁₃ - ∂₃g₁₃ ) = 0\n\nΓ²₁₁ = (1/2) g²² ( ∂₂g₁₁ + ∂₁g₂₁ - ∂₁g₂₁ ) = 0\nΓ²₂₂ = (1/2) g²² ( ∂₂g₂₂ + ∂₂g₂₂ - ∂₂g₂₂ ) = 0\nΓ²₃₃ = (1/2) g²² ( ∂₂g₃₃ + ∂₃g₂₃ - ∂₃g₂₃ ) = 0\n\nΓ³₁₁ = (1/2) g³³ ( ∂₃g₁₁ + ∂₁g₃₁ - ∂₁g₃₁ ) = 0\nΓ³₂₂ = (1/2) g³³ ( ∂₃g₂₂ + ∂₂g₃₂ - ∂₂g₃₂ ) = 0\nΓ³₃₃ = (1/2) g³³ ( ∂₃g₃₃ + ∂₃g₃₃ - ∂₃g₃₃ ) = 0\n\nAll the non-zero Christoffel symbols are zero. Therefore, the Levi-Civita connection for the given metric is identically zero."
