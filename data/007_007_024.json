    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 4x + 9y = 37 for positive integer values of x and y, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the general solution and then find the specific positive integer solutions.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 9 using the Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n9 = 2 * 4 + 1\n4 = 4 * 1\n\nThe GCD of 4 and 9 is 1, which divides 37, so there are integer solutions to the equation.\n\nNow, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients that satisfy the equation:\n\n1 = 9 - 2 * 4\n\nSo, the particular solution is x = -2 and y = 1. To find the general solution, we can use the formula:\n\nx = x0 + (n * b) / gcd(a, b)\ny = y0 - (n * a) / gcd(a, b)\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions, a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the equation, gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b, and n is an integer.\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = 9, gcd(a, b) = 1, x0 = -2, and y0 = 1. Plugging these values into the general solution formula, we get:\n\nx = -2 + 9n\ny = 1 - 4n\n\nNow, we need to find the positive integer values of x and y. Since x and y must be positive, we can set up inequalities:\n\n-2 + 9n > 0\n1 - 4n > 0\n\nSolving these inequalities, we get:\n\nn > 2/9\nn < 1/4\n\nSince n must be an integer, there is no integer value of n that satisfies both inequalities. Therefore, there are no positive integer solutions for x and y in the Diophantine equation 4x + 9y = 37."
