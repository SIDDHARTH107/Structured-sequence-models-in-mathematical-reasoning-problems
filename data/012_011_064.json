    "message_2": "A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of cut vertices. To maximize the number of cut vertices, we can create a linear graph, where each vertex is connected to at most two other vertices. In this case, the graph will have 9 edges (10 vertices - 1). However, we have 12 edges, so we need to add 3 more edges to the graph. We can add these edges without creating any cycles, which ensures that the number of cut vertices remains the same. For example, we can connect vertices 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6. In this case, the graph will still have 8 cut vertices (all vertices except the first and the last).\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of bridges. To maximize the number of bridges, we can create a tree (a connected graph with no cycles). In a tree with n vertices, there are always n-1 edges. In our case, with 10 vertices, there will be 9 edges. However, we have 12 edges, so we need to add 3 more edges to the graph. Since the graph is already connected, adding any edge will create a cycle, which means that the new edge cannot be a bridge. Therefore, the maximum number of bridges in the graph is 9 (the number of edges in the tree)."
