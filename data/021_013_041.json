    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a student to solve related to solving an optimization problem using simulated annealing method:\n\nA company produces two types of products, X and Y. The company has a limited budget and wants to maximize the profits. The production of X product requires 3 hours of machine time, while production of Y product requires 6 hours of machine time. The company has 120 hours of machine time available in a week. The profit for a produced unit of X product is $4, while for Y product it is $6. Determine the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce in a week to maximize the profit. Use the simulated annealing method to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the simulated annealing method, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and the initial solution.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 4X + 6Y\nConstraints: 3X + 6Y ≤ 120 (machine time constraint)\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\nLet's set the initial temperature T = 100, cooling rate α = 0.95, and the stopping temperature T_stop = 1.\n\nStep 2: Generate an initial solution\nWe can start with an initial solution, for example, X = 20 and Y = 10. This solution satisfies the constraint (3*20 + 6*10 = 120).\n\nStep 3: Simulated annealing algorithm\nWhile T > T_stop:\n  1. Generate a random neighbor solution by slightly changing the values of X and Y.\n  2. Calculate the change in profit ΔP = P_new - P_old.\n  3. If ΔP > 0, accept the new solution.\n  4. If ΔP < 0, accept the new solution with probability exp(ΔP/T).\n  5. Update the temperature T = α * T.\n\nStep 4: Repeat step 3 until the stopping condition is met (T ≤ T_stop).\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain the optimal solution for the number of units of X and Y products to maximize the profit. Note that the solution may not be unique, and the algorithm might converge to different solutions depending on the initial solution and random neighbor generation. However, the simulated annealing method is a powerful optimization technique that can provide near-optimal solutions for complex problems."
