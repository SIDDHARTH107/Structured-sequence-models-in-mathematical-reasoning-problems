    "message_2": "To determine which option the math student should choose, we can calculate the expected value of each option. The expected value is the average outcome of an event occurring multiple times and can be calculated by multiplying the probability of success by the profit.\n\nExpected Value of Option A:\nProbability of Success (A) * Profit (A) = 0.6 * $500 = $300\n\nExpected Value of Option B:\nProbability of Success (B) * Profit (B) = 0.8 * $300 = $240\n\nSince the expected value of Option A ($300) is higher than the expected value of Option B ($240), the math student should choose Option A."
