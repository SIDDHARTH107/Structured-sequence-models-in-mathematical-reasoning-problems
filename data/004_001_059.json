    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x² + 5x - 2, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nFor f(x) = 3x² + 5x - 2, we have three terms to differentiate:\n\n1. The derivative of 3x²:\n   Using the power rule, n = 2, so f'(x) = 2 * 3x^(2-1) = 6x.\n\n2. The derivative of 5x:\n   Using the power rule, n = 1, so f'(x) = 1 * 5x^(1-1) = 5.\n\n3. The derivative of -2 (a constant):\n   The derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of the individual terms:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 5 + 0 = 6x + 5\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x² + 5x - 2 is f'(x) = 6x + 5."
