    "message_2": "To find the integral of tan(x) dx from x=0 to x=π/4, we first need to find the antiderivative of tan(x). We know that the derivative of ln|sec(x)| is sec(x)tan(x), so we can use integration by substitution to find the antiderivative of tan(x).\n\nLet u = sec(x), so du = sec(x)tan(x) dx. Then, we have:\n\n∫tan(x) dx = ∫(1/cos(x)) * sin(x) dx = ∫(sin(x)/cos(x)) dx\n\nNow, we substitute u = sec(x) and du = sec(x)tan(x) dx:\n\n∫(sin(x)/cos(x)) dx = ∫(1/u) du = ln|u| + C = ln|sec(x)| + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral from x=0 to x=π/4:\n\n∫(tan(x) dx) from x=0 to x=π/4 = ln|sec(π/4)| - ln|sec(0)|\n\nsec(π/4) = √2 and sec(0) = 1, so we have:\n\nln(√2) - ln(1) = ln(√2) - 0 = ln(√2)\n\nSo, the integral of tan(x) dx from x=0 to x=π/4 is ln(√2)."
