    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)Y(y)T'(t) = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = -k^2$\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -k^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $T'(t) + k^2T(t) = 0$\n2. $X''(x) + k^2X(x) = -\\lambda X(x)$ and $Y''(y) + k^2Y(y) = -\\lambda Y(y)$\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\n$T(t) = Ce^{-k^2t}$\n\nSolving the second ODE, we get:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$ and $Y(y) = D\\cos(ky) + E\\sin(ky)$\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{nm}e^{-k^2t}\\cos(kx)\\cos(ky)$\n\nTo find the coefficients $C_{nm}$, we use the initial condition $u(x, y, 0) = e^{-x^2-y^2}$:\n\n$e^{-x^2-y^2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{nm}\\cos(kx)\\cos(ky)$\n\nWe can find the coefficients $C_{nm}$ using Fourier series, but this is a complicated process. However, since we are only interested in the value of $u(1, 0, \\pi)$, we can simplify the problem.\n\nAt $(1, 0, \\pi)$, the general solution becomes:\n\n$u(1, 0, \\pi) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{nm}e^{-k^2\\pi}\\cos(k)\\cos(0)$\n\n$u(1, 0, \\pi) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{nm}e^{-k^2\\pi}\\cos(k)$\n\nSince the initial condition is symmetric with respect to $x$ and $y$, we can assume that the coefficients $C_{nm}$ are also symmetric. Therefore, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\n$u(1, 0, \\pi) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_{n}e^{-k^2\\pi}\\cos(k)$\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find the coefficients $C_n$:\n\n$e^{-x^2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_{n}\\cos(kx)$\n\nUsing the orthogonality of cosine functions, we can find the coefficients $C_n$:\n\n$C_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\pi} e^{-x^2}\\cos(kx) dx$\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution. However, we can approximate the value of $u(1, 0, \\pi)$ by truncating the sum after a few terms. The more terms we include, the better the approximation will be."
