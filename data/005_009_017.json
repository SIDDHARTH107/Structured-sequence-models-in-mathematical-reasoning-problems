    "message_2": "To find the median score, we first need to arrange the scores in ascending order:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25\n\nSince there are 25 students (an odd number), the median score will be the middle value, which is the 13th value in the ordered list:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, (13), 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25\n\nSo, the median score is 13."
