    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible partitions for each prime factor's exponent:\n   For 2^4: (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1) -> 5 partitions\n   For 3^1: (1) -> 1 partition\n3. Use the formula for the number of abelian groups of a given order: \n   Number of abelian groups = product of the number of partitions for each prime factor's exponent\n   In this case, the number of abelian groups = 5 * 1 = 5\n4. Use the formula for the number of non-abelian groups of a given order:\n   Number of non-abelian groups = total number of groups - number of abelian groups\n   To find the total number of groups, we can use the following table:\n\n   | p^k | Number of groups of order p^k |\n   |-----|-------------------------------|\n   | 2^1 | 1                             |\n   | 2^2 | 2                             |\n   | 2^3 | 5                             |\n   | 2^4 | 15                            |\n   | 3^1 | 1                             |\n\n   Total number of groups of order 48 = (15 * 1) + (5 * 1) = 20\n   Number of non-abelian groups = 20 - 5 = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups and 5 non-isomorphic abelian groups of order 48, making a total of 20 non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\nThe 5 non-isomorphic abelian groups are:\n1. Z_48\n2. Z_24 x Z_2\n3. Z_16 x Z_3\n4. Z_8 x Z_6\n5. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_3\n\nThe 15 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups are more difficult to list explicitly, but they can be found using various techniques, such as constructing groups with given properties, examining semidirect products, and using computer software like GAP or Magma."
