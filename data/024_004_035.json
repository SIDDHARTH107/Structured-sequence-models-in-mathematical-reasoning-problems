    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the cylindrical surface at the given point, we first need to find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) and then calculate the mean curvature using the formula:\n\nMean curvature (H) = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nFor a cylinder, one of the principal curvatures (k1) is always 0 because it has no curvature along its height. The other principal curvature (k2) is the reciprocal of the radius of the cylinder.\n\nk1 = 0\nk2 = 1 / radius = 1 / 2 cm\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature (H):\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2 = (0 + 1/2) / 2 = 1/4 cm^(-1)\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, √3, 2) is 1/4 cm^(-1)."
