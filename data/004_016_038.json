    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, we have a continuous function representing the distance traveled by the car over time. We are given that the car travels 80 miles in 2 hours. We can represent this as a closed interval [0, 2] for the time (in hours) and a corresponding closed interval [0, 80] for the distance (in miles).\n\nThe average rate of change of the distance function over the interval [0, 2] can be found by dividing the change in distance by the change in time:\n\nAverage speed = (Final distance - Initial distance) / (Final time - Initial time)\nAverage speed = (80 miles - 0 miles) / (2 hours - 0 hours)\nAverage speed = 80 miles / 2 hours\nAverage speed = 40 miles per hour\n\nSo, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the distance function (i.e., the speed of the car) at c is equal to the average speed of 40 miles per hour."
