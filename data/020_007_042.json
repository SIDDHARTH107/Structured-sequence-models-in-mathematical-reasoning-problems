    "message_1": "A company needs to ship 100 packages to different locations. Each package must be shipped to one of five different locations, but some locations have a limit on the number of packages they can receive. Location A can only receive 20 packages, Location B can only receive 30 packages, Location C can only receive 15 packages, Location D can only receive 25 packages, and Location E can only receive 10 packages. What is the optimal way to distribute the packages among the locations to minimize the number of locations that reach their package limit?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of locations that reach their package limit, we should try to distribute the packages as evenly as possible among the locations. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total capacity of all locations: \nA: 20 packages\nB: 30 packages\nC: 15 packages\nD: 25 packages\nE: 10 packages\nTotal capacity: 20 + 30 + 15 + 25 + 10 = 100 packages\n\nSince the total capacity is equal to the number of packages that need to be shipped (100), we can distribute the packages in such a way that each location receives the maximum number of packages it can handle without exceeding its limit.\n\nSo, the optimal distribution would be:\nLocation A: 20 packages\nLocation B: 30 packages\nLocation C: 15 packages\nLocation D: 25 packages\nLocation E: 10 packages\n\nIn this distribution, all locations will reach their package limit, but this is the most even distribution possible given the constraints."
