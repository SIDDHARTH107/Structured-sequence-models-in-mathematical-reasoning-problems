    "message_1": "Sure, here's a related rates problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA ladder is 10 feet long and leaning against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 ft/s. At what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall? (Hint: this problem involves the Pythagorean theorem) \n\nThe student is expected to use calculus to solve for the rate of change of the height of the top of the ladder with respect to time (in ft/s) at the given moment, by finding the derivative of the relevant equation.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, and let y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 feet long, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\nx^2 + y^2 = 100\n\nNow we need to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall, which is dy/dt. We are given that the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 ft/s, which is dx/dt.\n\nTo find dy/dt, we will differentiate the equation above with respect to time (t):\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that dx/dt = 2 ft/s and that x = 6 feet when we want to find dy/dt. To find the value of y at this moment, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 100\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow solve for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -24\ndy/dt = -24/16\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, at the given moment when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 ft/s (negative sign indicates that the height is decreasing)."
