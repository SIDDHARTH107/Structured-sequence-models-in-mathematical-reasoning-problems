    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the algebraic curve given by the equation x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 1. Show that this curve is birational to the curve given by the equation z^2 = x^2 - y^2. Find the rational function that defines the birational map between these two curves.",
    "message_2": "To show that the two curves are birational, we need to find a rational map between them. Let's first rewrite the first equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 1\n(x + y)^2 = 1\n\nNow, let's define two new variables u and v as follows:\n\nu = x + y\nv = x - y\n\nWe can solve for x and y in terms of u and v:\n\nx = (u + v) / 2\ny = (u - v) / 2\n\nNow, let's substitute these expressions for x and y into the second equation:\n\nz^2 = x^2 - y^2\nz^2 = ((u + v) / 2)^2 - ((u - v) / 2)^2\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation:\n\nz^2 = (u^2 + 2uv + v^2 - u^2 + 2uv - v^2) / 4\nz^2 = (4uv) / 4\nz^2 = uv\n\nNow, we have found a rational map between the two curves:\n\n(x, y, z) -> (u, v, z) = ((x + y), (x - y), sqrt(x^2 - y^2))\n\nThis map is also invertible:\n\n(u, v, z) -> (x, y, z) = (((u + v) / 2), ((u - v) / 2), sqrt(uv))\n\nSince we have found a rational map between the two curves, we can conclude that they are birational."
