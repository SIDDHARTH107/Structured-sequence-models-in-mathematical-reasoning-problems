    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. These groups are:\n\n1. Cyclic group C36: This group is generated by a single element of order 36. The permutation that defines this group is (1 2 3 ... 36).\n\n2. Direct product of C9 and C4, denoted as C9 × C4: This group is generated by two elements, one of order 9 and one of order 4. The permutations that define this group are (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) and (10 11 12 13).\n\n3. Direct product of C3 and C12, denoted as C3 × C12: This group is generated by two elements, one of order 3 and one of order 12. The permutations that define this group are (1 2 3) and (4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15).\n\n4. The dihedral group D18: This group is generated by two elements, one of order 18 (a rotation) and one of order 2 (a reflection). The permutations that define this group are (1 2 3 ... 18) and (1 18)(2 17)(3 16)...(8 11)(9 10).\n\nThese are the four non-isomorphic groups of order 36 and the permutations that define each of them."
