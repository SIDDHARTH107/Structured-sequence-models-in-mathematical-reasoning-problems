    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that as the number of iterations increases, the curve fills more and more of the space it occupies. In the case of the Peano curve, it is constructed using a series of smaller line segments.\n\nAt each iteration, the number of line segments in the curve is multiplied by 9. This is because the curve is divided into 9 smaller copies of itself, each with the same number of segments as the previous iteration.\n\nTo find the length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = (number of line segments) * (length of each segment)\n\nFor the first iteration, there are 9 line segments, each with a length of 1 unit. So, the length of the curve after the first iteration is 9 * 1 = 9 units.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the number of line segments is multiplied by 9. So, after 5 iterations, the number of line segments is:\n\n9 * 9^4 = 9 * 6561 = 59049\n\nSince each line segment has a length of 1 unit, the length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations is:\n\nLength = 59049 * 1 = 59049 units."
