    "message_1": "A bird is perched on top of a 25 meters tall tree. A birdwatcher is standing 40 meters away from the tree. What is the distance between the bird and birdwatcher, rounded to the nearest meter? (Assume the birdwatcher and the bird are on level ground.)",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. Let the distance between the bird and the birdwatcher be represented by \"d\". The height of the tree is one side of the right triangle (25 meters), and the distance between the birdwatcher and the tree is the other side (40 meters).\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that a² + b² = c², where a and b are the two shorter sides of the right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse (the longest side, which is the distance between the bird and the birdwatcher in this case).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n25² + 40² = d²\n625 + 1600 = d²\n2225 = d²\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the value of d:\n\n√2225 = d\n47.17 ≈ d\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the distance between the bird and the birdwatcher is approximately 47 meters."
