    "message_1": "If the original Dragon curve has a length of 1 unit, and we repeat the process of doubling the length and adding a new segment to the middle of each segment in the curve, how long will the Dragon curve be after 5 iterations?",
    "message_2": "The Dragon curve grows in length with each iteration. After each iteration, the length of the curve is doubled and an additional segment is added for each existing segment. The formula for the length of the Dragon curve after n iterations is:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit and we want to find the length after 5 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^5) = 1 * 32 = 32 units\n\nSo, the Dragon curve will be 32 units long after 5 iterations."
