    "message_1": "A metal rod 20 centimeters long and 15 millimeters in diameter is heated at one end to a temperature of 100°C. The other end of the rod is kept at a constant temperature of 20°C. Using the Fourier transform, what is the temperature distribution along the rod at time t = 10 seconds, assuming the initial temperature of the rod was 20°C and its thermal diffusivity is 0.1 cm^2/s?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution along the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity, x is the position along the rod, and t is the time.\n\nBoundary conditions:\nT(0,t) = 100°C (heated end)\nT(20,t) = 20°C (other end)\n\nInitial condition:\nT(x,0) = 20°C\n\nTo solve the heat equation with these boundary and initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation and dividing by T(x,t), we get:\n\n(1/T) ∂T/∂t = α (1/X) ∂²X/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1/T) ∂T/∂t = -λ = α (1/X) ∂²X/∂x²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. (1/T) ∂T/∂t = -λ\n2. (1/X) ∂²X/∂x² = -λ/α\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n1. T(t) = Ce^(-λt)\n2. X(x) = A*cos(√(λ/α)x) + B*sin(√(λ/α)x)\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0,t) = 100°C => X(0)T(t) = 100 => X(0) = 100/C\nT(20,t) = 20°C => X(20)T(t) = 20 => X(20) = 20/C\n\nApplying the initial condition and using the Fourier series, we can write the solution as:\n\nT(x,t) = 20 + (100 - 20) * Σ [(1/nπ) * sin(nπ/2) * sin(nπx/20) * e^(-n²π²αt/400)]\n\nNow we can plug in the given values for x, t, and α:\n\nT(x,10) = 20 + 80 * Σ [(1/nπ) * sin(nπ/2) * sin(nπx/20) * e^(-n²π²(0.1)t/400)]\n\nT(x,10) = 20 + 80 * Σ [(1/nπ) * sin(nπ/2) * sin(nπx/20) * e^(-n²π²(0.1)(10)/400)]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution along the rod at t = 10 seconds. To find the temperature at specific points along the rod, simply plug in the desired x value (in centimeters) into the equation and sum the series. Note that the series converges quickly, so only a few terms are needed for a good approximation."
