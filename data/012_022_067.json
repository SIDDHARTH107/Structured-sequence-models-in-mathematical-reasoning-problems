    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices contains either a complete subgraph with m vertices or an independent set with n vertices. In this case, we are looking for R(5, 5).\n\nUnfortunately, the exact value of R(5, 5) is not known. It is known that R(5, 5) is between 43 and 49, but the exact value has not been determined yet. This is an open problem in the field of Ramsey theory."
