    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph G is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in G. In this case, the graph G has 6 vertices and 9 edges. The vertices {1, 2, 3} form a triangle, which is a complete subgraph with 3 vertices. The vertices {4, 5} and {3, 6} are connected by edges, but they do not form a complete subgraph larger than the triangle formed by {1, 2, 3}. Therefore, the clique number of this graph G is 3."
