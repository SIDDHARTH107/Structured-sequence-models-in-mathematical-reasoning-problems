    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student studying Interpolation and extrapolation of data using Lagrange polynomials:\n\nSuppose you are given the following set of data: (1, 3), (3, 5), (4, 7), (6, 11). Using Lagrange polynomials, interpolate the value of y when x = 2. Additionally, using the same set of data, extrapolate the value of y when x = 8.",
    "message_2": "To interpolate the value of y when x = 2 and extrapolate the value of y when x = 8 using Lagrange polynomials, we first need to find the Lagrange polynomial for the given data points.\n\nThe Lagrange polynomial is given by:\n\nL(x) = L_0(x) * y_0 + L_1(x) * y_1 + L_2(x) * y_2 + L_3(x) * y_3\n\nwhere L_i(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials and y_i are the y-values of the given data points.\n\nThe Lagrange basis polynomials are defined as:\n\nL_i(x) = Π((x - x_j) / (x_i - x_j)) for j ≠ i\n\nFor our given data points (1, 3), (3, 5), (4, 7), (6, 11), we can calculate the Lagrange basis polynomials as follows:\n\nL_0(x) = ((x - 3) * (x - 4) * (x - 6)) / ((1 - 3) * (1 - 4) * (1 - 6))\nL_1(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 4) * (x - 6)) / ((3 - 1) * (3 - 4) * (3 - 6))\nL_2(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 3) * (x - 6)) / ((4 - 1) * (4 - 3) * (4 - 6))\nL_3(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 3) * (x - 4)) / ((6 - 1) * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4))\n\nNow, we can find the interpolated value of y when x = 2:\n\nL(2) = L_0(2) * 3 + L_1(2) * 5 + L_2(2) * 7 + L_3(2) * 11\n\nL(2) ≈ 4.0\n\nSo, the interpolated value of y when x = 2 is approximately 4.\n\nNext, we can find the extrapolated value of y when x = 8:\n\nL(8) = L_0(8) * 3 + L_1(8) * 5 + L_2(8) * 7 + L_3(8) * 11\n\nL(8) ≈ 16.0\n\nSo, the extrapolated value of y when x = 8 is approximately 16."
