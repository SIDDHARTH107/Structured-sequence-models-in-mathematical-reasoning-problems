Here's an example:\n\nLet X be a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus 3 and let L be an ample line bundle on X such that the numerical class of L is equal to (1,1) in the Néron-Severi group. Show that there exists an effective divisor D on X such that L = K_X + D, where K_X is the canonical bundle of X.\n\n(Note: In this problem, the student is expected to use the basic concepts of Mori theory, such as the cone of effective divisors and the cone theorem.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the basic concepts of Mori theory, such as the cone of effective divisors and the cone theorem.\n\nFirst, recall that for a smooth projective algebraic curve X of genus g, the canonical bundle K_X is given by the divisor of a canonical meromorphic differential, and its degree is 2g - 2. In our case, since the genus g = 3, the degree of K_X is 2(3) - 2 = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the ample line bundle L with numerical class (1,1) in the Néron-Severi group. Since L is ample, it has positive degree. In this case, the degree of L is given by the intersection number L.C, where C is a curve in X. Since the numerical class of L is (1,1), the degree of L is 1.\n\nNext, we want to find an effective divisor D on X such that L = K_X + D. To do this, we will use the cone theorem from Mori theory. The cone theorem states that the cone of effective divisors on X can be decomposed into a finite number of extremal rays and the canonical class K_X.\n\nIn our case, the cone of effective divisors on X is generated by the canonical class K_X and the ample line bundle L. Since K_X and L have different degrees (4 and 1, respectively), they generate different extremal rays in the cone of effective divisors. Therefore, we can write any effective divisor E on X as a linear combination of K_X and L:\n\nE = aK_X + bL,\n\nwhere a and b are non-negative real numbers.\n\nNow, we want to find an effective divisor D such that L = K_X + D. In other words, we want to find non-negative real numbers a and b such that:\n\nL = aK_X + bL.\n\nSince L is ample and has positive degree, we can choose a = 1 and b = -1:\n\nL = 1*K_X + (-1)*L.\n\nThis gives us the effective divisor D = -1*L, which satisfies the desired equation:\n\nL = K_X + D.\n\nThus, there exists an effective divisor D on X such that L = K_X + D, as required."
