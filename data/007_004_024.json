    "message_2": "To find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 24 and 36, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (36) by the smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n   36 รท 24 = 1, remainder 12\n\n2. Replace the larger number (36) with the smaller number (24) and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\n   Now we have to find the GCD of 24 and 12.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (24) by the new smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n   24 รท 12 = 2, remainder 0\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12.\n\nSo, the GCD of 24 and 36 is 12."
