    "message_1": "Suppose the weight of avocados in a grocery store follows a normal distribution with a mean of 160 grams and a standard deviation of 10 grams. What is the probability that a randomly selected avocado weighs between 150 and 170 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected avocado weighs between 150 and 170 grams, we will use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores for 150 grams and 170 grams.\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nFor 150 grams:\nz1 = (150 - 160) / 10 = -1\n\nFor 170 grams:\nz2 = (170 - 160) / 10 = 1\n\nNow, we will look up the probabilities associated with these z-scores in the standard normal distribution table.\n\nFor z1 = -1, the probability is 0.1587 (15.87%).\nFor z2 = 1, the probability is 0.8413 (84.13%).\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected avocado weighs between 150 and 170 grams, we will subtract the probability of z1 from the probability of z2:\n\nP(150 < X < 170) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected avocado weighs between 150 and 170 grams is approximately 0.6826 or 68.26%."
