    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nA × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of C and D, denoted as C × D.\n\nC × D = {(2, 2), (2, y), (x, 2), (x, y)}\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection of A and C, denoted as A ∩ C. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ C = {2}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ C) and B, denoted as (A ∩ C) × B.\n\n(A ∩ C) × B = {2} × {x, y} = {(2, x), (2, y)}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of (A × B) and (C × B), denoted as (A × B) ∩ (C × B). The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\n(A × B) ∩ (C × B) = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)} ∩ {(2, x), (2, y)} = {(2, x), (2, y)}\n\nFinally, we can see that (A ∩ C) × B = (A × B) ∩ (C × B) since both sets are equal to {(2, x), (2, y)}."
