    "message_1": "A student has 10 different toys that they want to arrange on a shelf. How many different arrangements of toys are possible if they cannot have 2 specific toys together?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the total number of arrangements without any restrictions. Since there are 10 different toys, there are 10! (10 factorial) ways to arrange them. 10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800.\n\nNow, let's find the number of arrangements where the 2 specific toys are together. We can treat these 2 toys as a single unit, so we have 9 units to arrange (8 individual toys and 1 pair of toys). There are 9! ways to arrange these 9 units: 9! = 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 362,880.\n\nHowever, within this single unit, the 2 specific toys can be arranged in 2! ways (since there are 2 toys). So, we have 9! × 2! = 362,880 × 2 = 725,760 arrangements where the 2 specific toys are together.\n\nTo find the number of arrangements where the 2 specific toys are not together, we subtract the number of arrangements where they are together from the total number of arrangements without any restrictions:\n\n3,628,800 (total arrangements) - 725,760 (arrangements with the 2 specific toys together) = 2,903,040.\n\nSo, there are 2,903,040 different arrangements of toys where the 2 specific toys are not together."
