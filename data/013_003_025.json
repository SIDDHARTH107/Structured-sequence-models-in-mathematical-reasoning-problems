    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game with two players, Player 1 suggests the division of $100 between them and Player 2 can either accept or reject the offer. If Player 2 accepts, the money is divided according to the suggested proposal. If Player 2 rejects, both players receive nothing. If both players are rational and want to maximize their profit, what is the lowest amount that Player 1 should offer so that Player 2 accepts the proposal?",
    "message_2": "In an Ultimatum Game, if both players are rational and want to maximize their profit, Player 1 should offer the lowest amount that Player 2 would still accept. Since Player 2 would prefer to have some money rather than nothing, they would accept any amount greater than $0.\n\nTherefore, the lowest amount that Player 1 should offer so that Player 2 accepts the proposal is $1. This way, Player 1 would keep $99, and Player 2 would get $1."
