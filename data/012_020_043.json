    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nTo find the automorphism group of graph G, we need to find all possible permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. Let's list the adjacency relations of the graph G:\n\n1: {2, 4}\n2: {1, 5}\n3: {4, 5}\n4: {1, 3}\n5: {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself, is always an automorphism. So, (1 2 3 4 5) is an automorphism.\n\n2. We can swap vertices 2 and 5, and vertices 4 and 3. This gives us the automorphism (1)(2 5)(3 4).\n\n3. We can also swap vertices 1 and 3, and vertices 2 and 4. This gives us the automorphism (1 3)(2 4)(5).\n\n4. Finally, we can apply both of the previous swaps, resulting in the automorphism (1 3)(2 5 4).\n\nSo, the automorphism group of graph G is { (1 2 3 4 5), (1)(2 5)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4)(5), (1 3)(2 5 4) }."
