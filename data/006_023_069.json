    "message_1": "Suppose a market has 600 customers, of which 400 are males and 200 are females. Among the males, 240 prefer brand A, while among the females, 100 prefer brand A. What is the probability of randomly selecting a male customer who prefers brand A?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of randomly selecting a male customer who prefers brand A, we need to divide the number of male customers who prefer brand A by the total number of male customers.\n\nNumber of male customers who prefer brand A = 240\nTotal number of male customers = 400\n\nProbability = (Number of male customers who prefer brand A) / (Total number of male customers)\nProbability = 240 / 400\n\nProbability = 0.6 or 60%\n\nSo, the probability of randomly selecting a male customer who prefers brand A is 60%."
