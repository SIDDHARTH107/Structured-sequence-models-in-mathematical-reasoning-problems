    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B △ A. Since symmetric difference is commutative, B △ A = A △ B.\n\nB △ A = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) ∩ B:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNext, let's find (B △ A) ∩ A:\n\n(B △ A) ∩ A = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) ∩ B ≠ (B △ A) ∩ A, which means the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection."
