    "message_2": "First, let's recall some facts about groups and isomorphisms:\n\n1. A group of order p, where p is a prime number, is always cyclic and isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p, denoted as Cp.\n2. If a group G has a normal subgroup N of order n and a subgroup H of order m, where n and m are relatively prime (gcd(n, m) = 1), then G is isomorphic to the direct product of N and H, denoted as N x H.\n3. The dihedral group Dn is a non-abelian group of order 2n, which consists of n rotations and n reflections.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given groups:\n\na) C30 is the cyclic group of order 30. It has a unique element of order 30, and all its elements can be generated by this element.\n\nb) D15 is the dihedral group of order 2 * 15 = 30. It consists of 15 rotations and 15 reflections.\n\nc) The non-abelian group of order 30 is a group with 30 elements that is not commutative.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G of order 30. Since 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, G has Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups. Let P2, P3, and P5 be Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups of G, respectively.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p. Thus, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups divides 15 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups divides 10 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3, and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups divides 6 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only possibility for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 1, which means that P2 is a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, the only possibility for the number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 1, which means that P5 is a normal subgroup of G. Since the orders of P2 and P5 are relatively prime (gcd(2, 5) = 1), by fact 2, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P2 and P5, which is a cyclic group of order 2 * 5 = 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups divides 10 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are 1 and 10. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal, and G would be isomorphic to the direct product of P2, P3, and P5, which is a cyclic group of order 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. In this case, G would be isomorphic to C30.\n\nIf there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, then G is not isomorphic to C30, as it is not cyclic. In this case, G would be a non-abelian group of order 30. Since D15 is also a non-abelian group of order 30, G would be isomorphic to D15.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either C30 or D15, depending on the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. It cannot be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30, as this is not a well-defined group. To show the isomorphisms between G and the chosen group, one would need to construct an explicit bijection between the elements of G and the elements of the chosen group that preserves the group operation."
