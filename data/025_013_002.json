    "message_2": "To find the order of J(C) and the number of connected components of J(C) over the complex numbers, we first need to determine the genus of the curve C. The given equation is a cubic equation, which means that C is an elliptic curve. For an elliptic curve, the genus g is always equal to 1.\n\nNow, let's find the order of J(C). The order of J(C) is the number of points on the curve over a finite field. For an elliptic curve, the order is given by the Hasse-Weil theorem, which states that the number of points N on the curve over a finite field of order q is approximately q + 1 - a, where |a| ≤ 2√q. Since we are working over the complex numbers, we have an infinite field, and the order of J(C) is infinite.\n\nNext, let's find the number of connected components of J(C) over the complex numbers. The Jacobian J(C) of an algebraic curve C of genus g is an abelian variety of dimension g. For an elliptic curve, the Jacobian is isomorphic to the curve itself, and since the curve is connected, its Jacobian has only one connected component.\n\nIn summary, the order of J(C) is infinite, and the number of connected components of J(C) over the complex numbers is 1."
