    "message_1": "A chaotic system is given by the equation x(t+1) = 4x(t)(1-x(t)), where x(0) = 0.5. \nUsing the Poincaré map, find the value of x(3) correct to three decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of x(3), we need to iterate the given equation three times, starting with x(0) = 0.5.\n\nFirst iteration (t = 0):\nx(1) = 4 * x(0) * (1 - x(0))\nx(1) = 4 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)\nx(1) = 2 * 0.5\nx(1) = 1\n\nSecond iteration (t = 1):\nx(2) = 4 * x(1) * (1 - x(1))\nx(2) = 4 * 1 * (1 - 1)\nx(2) = 4 * 0\nx(2) = 0\n\nThird iteration (t = 2):\nx(3) = 4 * x(2) * (1 - x(2))\nx(3) = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0)\nx(3) = 0 * 1\nx(3) = 0\n\nSo, the value of x(3) is 0.000 (correct to three decimal places)."
