    "message_2": "To calculate the first Lyapunov exponent, we need to know the system's evolution function and its derivative. Unfortunately, the problem statement does not provide this information. The time series data alone is not sufficient to determine the evolution function or its derivative.\n\nIf you can provide the evolution function and its derivative, I can help you calculate the first Lyapunov exponent using the given formula."
