    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides with lengths of 6 meters and 9 meters, and the angle between them is 75 degrees. What is the perimeter of the triangle, rounded to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two known sides, C is the angle between them, and c is the length of the unknown side.\n\nIn this case, a = 6 meters, b = 9 meters, and C = 75 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (75 * π) / 180 ≈ 1.309 radians\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines:\n\nc² = 6² + 9² - 2 * 6 * 9 * cos(1.309)\nc² = 36 + 81 - 108 * cos(1.309)\nc² ≈ 117 - 108 * 0.2588\nc² ≈ 117 - 27.951\nc² ≈ 89.049\n\nNow, we find the square root to get the length of the third side:\n\nc ≈ √89.049 ≈ 9.44 meters\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c ≈ 6 + 9 + 9.44 ≈ 24.44 meters\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the perimeter is approximately 24 meters."
