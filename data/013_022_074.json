    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, the dictator is given 10 points to distribute between themselves and the receiver. The dictator can choose to keep any amount they want for themselves and give the rest to the receiver. If the dictator keeps X points for themselves, how many points will the receiver get? If the receiver gets Y points, what fractional amount of the total points did the receiver receive?",
    "message_2": "If the dictator keeps X points for themselves, the receiver will get the remaining points, which can be calculated as:\n\nY = 10 - X\n\nTo find the fractional amount of the total points the receiver received, we can create a fraction with Y as the numerator and the total points (10) as the denominator:\n\nFraction = Y/10 = (10 - X)/10\n\nSo, the receiver gets a fractional amount of (10 - X)/10 of the total points."
