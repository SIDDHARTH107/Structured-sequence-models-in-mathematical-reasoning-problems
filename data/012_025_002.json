    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph.\n\nWe can start at vertex 1 and try to visit all other vertices:\n\n1. Start at vertex 1, visit vertex 2: 1-2\n2. From vertex 2, visit vertex 3: 1-2-3\n3. From vertex 3, visit vertex 4: 1-2-3-4\n4. From vertex 4, visit vertex 5: 1-2-3-4-5\n\nNow, we have visited all vertices, but we cannot return to vertex 1 from vertex 5, as there is no edge between vertices 1 and 5. Therefore, this path does not form a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nLet's try another path:\n\n1. Start at vertex 1, visit vertex 4: 1-4\n2. From vertex 4, visit vertex 2: 1-4-2\n3. From vertex 2, visit vertex 3: 1-4-2-3\n4. From vertex 3, visit vertex 5: 1-4-2-3-5\n\nNow, we have visited all vertices, and there is an edge between vertices 5 and 1. Thus, we can return to vertex 1 from vertex 5: 1-4-2-3-5-1.\n\nThis path forms a Hamiltonian cycle, and the sequence of vertices is: 1-4-2-3-5-1."
