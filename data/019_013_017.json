If the set contains no even integers, the function should return 0. \n\nFor example, if the set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, the function should return 56 (2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 = 4 + 16 + 36 = 56).",
    "message_2": "To define a function in second-order logic that returns the sum of the squares of the even integers in a non-empty set of integers, we can use the following formula:\n\n∃f ∀S (f(S) = Σ (x^2 | x ∈ S ∧ x is even))\n\nHere, f is the function we want to define, S is a non-empty set of integers, and x is an integer. The formula states that there exists a function f such that for all sets S, f(S) is equal to the sum of the squares of the even integers in S.\n\nTo express the condition \"x is even\" in second-order logic, we can use the following formula:\n\n∃y (x = 2 * y)\n\nHere, y is an integer. The formula states that there exists an integer y such that x is equal to 2 times y.\n\nNow, we can combine these formulas to define the desired function:\n\n∃f ∀S (f(S) = Σ (x^2 | x ∈ S ∧ (∃y (x = 2 * y))))\n\nThis formula defines a function f in second-order logic that returns the sum of the squares of the even integers in a non-empty set of integers. If the set contains no even integers, the function will return 0, as required."
