    "message_1": "A car is moving on a straight road with an increasing velocity of 3 m/s^2. If the initial velocity of the car was 10 m/s, find the distance traveled by the car after 8 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance traveled by the car, we can use the equation of motion:\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at^2\n\nwhere s is the distance traveled, u is the initial velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration.\n\nGiven, initial velocity (u) = 10 m/s, acceleration (a) = 3 m/s^2, and time (t) = 8 seconds.\n\nNow, plug in the values into the equation:\n\ns = (10 m/s)(8 s) + (1/2)(3 m/s^2)(8 s)^2\n\ns = 80 m + (1/2)(3 m/s^2)(64 s^2)\n\ns = 80 m + (1.5 m/s^2)(64 s^2)\n\ns = 80 m + 96 m\n\ns = 176 m\n\nSo, the distance traveled by the car after 8 seconds is 176 meters."
