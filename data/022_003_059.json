    "message_2": "To find the value of the integral of e^z over the circle |z-2i|=3 in the complex plane, we can use the parameterization of the circle and then apply Cauchy's integral theorem.\n\nFirst, let's parameterize the circle. We can write z in terms of a parameter t as follows:\n\nz = 2i + 3e^(it), where t ∈ [0, 2π]\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of z with respect to t:\n\ndz/dt = 3ie^(it)\n\nNow, we can write the integral as:\n\n∫(e^z dz) = ∫(e^(2i + 3e^(it)) * 3ie^(it) dt), where t ∈ [0, 2π]\n\nHowever, since e^z is an entire function (i.e., it is holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane), Cauchy's integral theorem states that the integral of e^z over any closed curve (such as our circle) is equal to 0.\n\nSo, the value of the integral of e^z over the circle |z-2i|=3 in the complex plane is 0."
