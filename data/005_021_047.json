    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the average rating of all customers who will review this company in the future using bootstrapping, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample the dataset with replacement (i.e., randomly select 1000 customer reviews from the original dataset, allowing for duplicates) and calculate the average rating for each resampled dataset.\n2. Repeat step 1 a large number of times (e.g., 10,000 times) to create a distribution of average ratings.\n3. Calculate the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the distribution, which will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform the bootstrapping process and generate random samples. I recommend using a programming language like Python or R to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's an example of how you could perform bootstrapping using Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original dataset information\naverage_rating = 4.2\nstandard_deviation = 0.8\nnum_reviews = 1000\n\n# Generate a synthetic dataset based on the given information\nnp.random.seed(42)\nratings = np.random.normal(average_rating, standard_deviation, num_reviews)\n\n# Bootstrapping\nnum_iterations = 10000\nbootstrap_means = []\n\nfor _ in range(num_iterations):\n    resampled_ratings = np.random.choice(ratings, size=num_reviews, replace=True)\n    bootstrap_means.append(np.mean(resampled_ratings))\n\n# Calculate the 95% confidence interval\nlower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)\nupper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)\n\nprint(f\"The 95% confidence interval for the average rating is ({lower_bound:.2f}, {upper_bound:.2f})\")\n```\n\nThis code will generate a synthetic dataset based on the given information, perform bootstrapping, and calculate the 95% confidence interval for the average rating of all customers who will review this company in the future."
