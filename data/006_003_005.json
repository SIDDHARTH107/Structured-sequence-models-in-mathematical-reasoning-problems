    "message_1": "If a standard deck of cards is shuffled thoroughly and one card is drawn randomly, what is the probability that the card drawn is a king or a queen?",
    "message_2": "A standard deck of cards has 52 cards, with 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). Each suit has one king and one queen.\n\nThere are 4 kings and 4 queens in the deck, making a total of 8 cards that are either a king or a queen.\n\nThe probability of drawing a king or a queen is the number of favorable outcomes (kings or queens) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (all cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = (Number of kings or queens) / (Total number of cards in the deck)\n\nProbability = 8 / 52\n\nProbability = 2 / 13\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a king or a queen from a standard deck of cards is 2/13."
