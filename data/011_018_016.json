    "message_1": "In a classroom of 35 students, the teacher wants to divide them into groups of 7 students for a group activity. How many different ways can the teacher form these groups, where each group has exactly 7 students?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, k is the number of students in each group, and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nIn this case, n = 35 and k = 7.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to form the first group of 7 students:\n\nC(35, 7) = 35! / (7!(35-7)!) = 35! / (7!28!)\n\nNow, we have 28 students left. We need to find the number of ways to form the second group of 7 students:\n\nC(28, 7) = 28! / (7!(28-7)!) = 28! / (7!21!)\n\nNow, we have 21 students left. We need to find the number of ways to form the third group of 7 students:\n\nC(21, 7) = 21! / (7!(21-7)!) = 21! / (7!14!)\n\nNow, we have 14 students left. We need to find the number of ways to form the fourth group of 7 students:\n\nC(14, 7) = 14! / (7!(14-7)!) = 14! / (7!7!)\n\nFinally, we have 7 students left, and they will form the last group. There is only 1 way to form this group since all the remaining students will be in it.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to form each group together:\n\nTotal number of ways = C(35, 7) × C(28, 7) × C(21, 7) × C(14, 7)\n\nHowever, since the order of the groups does not matter, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 5 groups, which is 5!:\n\nTotal number of ways = (C(35, 7) × C(28, 7) × C(21, 7) × C(14, 7)) / 5!\n\nCalculating the factorials and plugging them into the formula, we get:\n\nTotal number of ways = (6545 × 1184040 × 116280 × 3432) / 120 = 3246326710\n\nSo, there are 3,246,326,710 different ways the teacher can form the groups of 7 students."
