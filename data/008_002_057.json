    "message_2": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix A using the formula method, we can use the following formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of matrix A, and adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = (1 * 4) - (2 * 3) = 4 - 6 = -2\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of matrix A. To do this, we swap the elements on the main diagonal and change the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = \n```\n 4 -2\n-3  1\n```\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A by multiplying the adjugate of A by the reciprocal of the determinant:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-2) * adj(A) = \n```\n-2  1\n 1.5 -0.5\n```\n\nSo, the inverse of matrix A is:\n```\n-2  1\n 1.5 -0.5\n```"
