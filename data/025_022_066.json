    "message_2": "The derived category of coherent sheaves on a non-singular cubic curve $C$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is denoted by $D^b(\\text{Coh}(C))$. It is a triangulated category that is generated by the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_C$ and its twists by the Serre line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(1)$.\n\nTo compute the derived category, we can use the Beilinson spectral sequence. The Beilinson spectral sequence is a tool that relates the derived category of coherent sheaves on a projective variety to the derived category of graded modules over a polynomial ring.\n\nFor a non-singular cubic curve $C$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, the Beilinson spectral sequence takes the form:\n\n$$E_2^{p, q} = \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} H^q(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(p - 2q + i)) \\Rightarrow D^b(\\text{Coh}(C))$$\n\nThe cohomology groups $H^q(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(p - 2q + i))$ can be computed using the Riemann-Roch theorem and Serre duality. For a non-singular cubic curve, we have:\n\n$$H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(n)) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } n < 0 \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } n = 0 \\\\\nn+1 & \\text{if } n > 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nand\n\n$$H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(n)) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } n \\geq -1 \\\\\n-n & \\text{if } n < -1\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nUsing these cohomology groups, we can compute the $E_2$ page of the Beilinson spectral sequence:\n\n$$E_2^{p, q} = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbb{C} & \\text{if } p = q = 0 \\\\\n\\mathbb{C}^{p+1} & \\text{if } p > 0 \\text{ and } q = 0 \\\\\n\\mathbb{C}^{-p} & \\text{if } p < 0 \\text{ and } q = 1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nSince the Beilinson spectral sequence degenerates at the $E_2$ page, we have:\n\n$$D^b(\\text{Coh}(C)) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\bigoplus_{q = 0}^1 E_2^{p, q}$$\n\nThus, the derived category of coherent sheaves on a non-singular cubic curve $C$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is generated by the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_C$ and its twists by the Serre line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(1)$, with the cohomology groups given above."
