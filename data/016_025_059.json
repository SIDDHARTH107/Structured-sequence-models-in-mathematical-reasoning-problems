    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that forms a larger equilateral triangle made up of smaller equilateral triangles. In each stage, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 3.\n\nTo find the total number of triangles in the 8th stage, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of triangles = Initial number of triangles * (Multiplier)^(Stage - 1)\n\nIn this case, the initial number of triangles is 1 (first stage), the multiplier is 3, and the stage is 8.\n\nTotal number of triangles = 1 * (3)^(8 - 1)\nTotal number of triangles = 1 * (3)^7\nTotal number of triangles = 1 * 2187\nTotal number of triangles = 2187\n\nSo, there are 2187 triangles in the 8th stage of the Sierpinski sieve when the first stage contains only one triangle."
