    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function over an interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, f(x) = sin(2x), a = 0, and b = π. So we have:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * ∫[0, π] sin(2x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(2x) with respect to x:\n\n∫ sin(2x) dx = (-1/2) * cos(2x) + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral over the interval [0, π]:\n\n((-1/2) * cos(2π)) - ((-1/2) * cos(0))\n\n= (-1/2) * (cos(2π) - cos(0))\n\n= (-1/2) * (1 - 1)\n\n= 0\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 0 = 0\n\nSo the average value of f(x) = sin(2x) over the interval [0, π] is 0."
