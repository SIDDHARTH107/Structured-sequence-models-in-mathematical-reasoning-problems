    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from the original cube. In each iteration, the surface area of the Menger sponge increases. The formula to calculate the surface area of a Menger sponge after n iterations is:\n\nSurface area = 6 * (20/9)^n * s^2\n\nwhere s is the side length of the original cube and n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the side length (s) is 9 cm, and the number of iterations (n) is 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface area = 6 * (20/9)^3 * 9^2\n\nSurface area ≈ 6 * 2.96296 * 81\n\nSurface area ≈ 1440.96 cm^2\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the surface area of the Menger sponge after 3 iterations is approximately 1440.96 cm^2."
