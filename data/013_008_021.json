    "message_1": "Consider a Public Goods Game with four players who each have $20 to contribute to a public good. The payoff to each player for contributing $x_i$ is given by $20 - .5 x_i + .25 (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4).$ If all players choose to contribute the same amount, what is the optimal contribution for each player to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "Let's first rewrite the payoff function for each player in terms of the total contribution of all players, denoted by $X$. Since all players contribute the same amount, we have $X = 4x_i$, and thus $x_i = \\frac{1}{4}X$. The payoff function for each player can now be written as:\n\n$P_i = 20 - 0.5x_i + 0.25(X) = 20 - 0.5\\left(\\frac{1}{4}X\\right) + 0.25(X)$.\n\nNow, we want to find the optimal contribution $x_i$ (or equivalently, the optimal total contribution $X$) that maximizes the payoff for each player. To do this, we can take the derivative of the payoff function with respect to $X$ and set it equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{dP_i}{dX} = -0.5\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 0.25 = 0$.\n\nSolving for $X$, we get:\n\n$X = 20$.\n\nSince $x_i = \\frac{1}{4}X$, the optimal contribution for each player is:\n\n$x_i = \\frac{1}{4}(20) = 5$.\n\nSo, each player should contribute $5 to maximize their payoff in this Public Goods Game."
