    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartan connection of M, we need to compute the curvature 2-form Ω associated with the connection 1-form ω. The curvature 2-form is given by the exterior derivative of the connection 1-form, i.e., Ω = dω.\n\nGiven ω = x dy, we can compute the exterior derivative as follows:\n\ndω = (d(x dy)) = (d(x) ∧ dy) + (x d(dy))\n\nSince d(x) = dx and d(dy) = 0 (because the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form, and there are no 3-forms in a 2-dimensional manifold), we have:\n\ndω = (dx ∧ dy) + (x * 0) = dx ∧ dy\n\nSo, the Cartan connection (curvature 2-form) of M is:\n\nΩ = dx ∧ dy"
