    "message_2": "Let's consider the two distinct points on the unit circle S¹ that we are identifying, say A and B. To find the fundamental group of X, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that if a space X is the union of two open, path-connected subspaces U and V such that their intersection U ∩ V is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X, denoted π₁(X), can be computed from the fundamental groups of U, V, and their intersection U ∩ V.\n\nLet's take U to be the unit circle S¹ with a small open neighborhood around point A removed, and V to be the unit circle S¹ with a small open neighborhood around point B removed. Then, U and V are both open and path-connected, and their intersection U ∩ V is the unit circle S¹ with small open neighborhoods around both A and B removed, which is also path-connected.\n\nNow, we can compute the fundamental groups of U, V, and U ∩ V. Since U and V are both homotopy equivalent to the unit circle S¹ with a single point removed, their fundamental groups are both isomorphic to the free group on one generator, i.e., π₁(U) ≅ π₁(V) ≅ ℤ. The intersection U ∩ V is homotopy equivalent to the unit circle S¹ with two points removed, which is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of two circles, so its fundamental group is the free group on two generators, i.e., π₁(U ∩ V) ≅ ℤ * ℤ.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem to compute the fundamental group of X. The theorem states that π₁(X) is the free product of π₁(U) and π₁(V) with the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i_U(x)i_V(x)^{-1} for x in π₁(U ∩ V), where i_U and i_V are the inclusion maps of U ∩ V into U and V, respectively.\n\nIn our case, since π₁(U) ≅ π₁(V) ≅ ℤ and π₁(U ∩ V) ≅ ℤ * ℤ, we have two generators for U ∩ V, say a and b. The inclusion maps i_U and i_V map these generators to the single generator of U and V, say g. So, the normal subgroup we need to quotient by is generated by the elements i_U(a)i_V(a)^{-1} = gg^{-1} = 1 and i_U(b)i_V(b)^{-1} = gg^{-1} = 1.\n\nThus, the fundamental group of X is the free product of π₁(U) and π₁(V) quotiented by the normal subgroup generated by the identity element, which is just the free product itself. Therefore, π₁(X) ≅ π₁(U) * π₁(V) ≅ ℤ * ℤ."
