    "message_2": "To find the maximum or minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 7 on the interval [0, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 2 and x = 4.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 4] and the critical points to see which give the maximum and minimum values of the function.\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 9(0)^2 + 24(0) + 7 = 7\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 24(2) + 7 = -7\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 24(4) + 7 = 15\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find that the maximum value of f(x) is 15 at x = 4, and the minimum value of f(x) is -7 at x = 2."
