    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 9x + 2, we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function, f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x³ - 6x² + 9x + 2) = 3x² - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x² - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x where f''(x) = 0:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 2. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, we plug this value back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)³ - 6(2)² + 9(2) + 2 = 8 - 24 + 18 + 2 = 4\n\nThus, the inflection point of the function f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 9x + 2 is (2, 4)."
