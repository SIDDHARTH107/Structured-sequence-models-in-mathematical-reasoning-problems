    "message_2": "To determine the frequency content of a 512x512 image in the range of 0-64 cycles per image, we will perform a 2D Fourier transform. The 2D Fourier transform will give us a frequency domain representation of the image, where each point represents a frequency component.\n\nIn the frequency domain, the range of 0-64 cycles per image corresponds to the first 65 frequency components in both the horizontal and vertical directions (including the 0th component). Therefore, the total number of frequency components in this range can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal frequency components = (number of horizontal components) x (number of vertical components)\nTotal frequency components = 65 x 65\nTotal frequency components = 4225\n\nSo, there are 4225 total frequency components present in the range of 0-64 cycles per image for a 512x512 image."
