    "message_2": "First, let's correct the statement: 25 is not a prime number, but it is a power of a prime number (5^2).\n\nNow, let's consider a group G of order 25. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) in G must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Since the only divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25, there are either 1 or 5 Sylow 5-subgroups in G. \n\nCase 1: There is only one Sylow 5-subgroup in G.\nIn this case, the unique Sylow 5-subgroup is normal in G. Let H be this subgroup. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H is cyclic. Let K be a subgroup of G such that G = HK and H âˆ© K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Then, by the direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of H is 5, the order of K must also be 5. Thus, K is also cyclic. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nCase 2: There are 5 Sylow 5-subgroups in G.\nIn this case, let H be one of the Sylow 5-subgroups. Since the order of H is 5, H is cyclic. Now, consider the action of G on the set of Sylow 5-subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group on 5 elements, S_5. The kernel of this homomorphism, N, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in H. Since H is cyclic of order 5, either N = H or N is trivial. If N = H, then H is normal in G, and we are back to Case 1. If N is trivial, then the homomorphism is injective, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_5. However, this is a contradiction, since the order of G (25) does not divide the order of S_5 (120). Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, the only possible structure for a group of order 25 is that it is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
