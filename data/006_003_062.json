    "message_2": "There is only 1 Ace of Spades in a standard deck of 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing the Ace of Spades is 1 out of 52, which can be represented as a fraction:\n\n1/52\n\nAs a decimal, this is approximately:\n\n0.0192\n\nAnd as a percentage, this is:\n\n1.92%\n\nSo, the probability of drawing an Ace of Spades from a standard deck of 52 cards is 1.92%."
