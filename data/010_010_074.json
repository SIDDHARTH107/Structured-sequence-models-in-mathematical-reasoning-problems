    "message_2": "To find the critical points of $f$, we need to find the points where the gradient of $f$ is zero. The gradient of $f$ is given by the vector of its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (3x^2 - 3y^2, -6xy)$.\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$\\begin{cases}\n3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0 \\\\\n-6xy = 0\n\\end{cases}$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. \n\nIf $x = 0$, the first equation becomes $-3y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So, one critical point is $(0,0)$.\n\nIf $y = 0$, the first equation becomes $3x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. But this case leads to the same critical point $(0,0)$.\n\nThus, the only critical point of $f$ is $(0,0)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the Morse index of this critical point. The Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of $f$ at the critical point. The Hessian matrix of $f$ is given by:\n\n$H_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n6x & -6y \\\\\n-6y & -6x\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nAt the critical point $(0,0)$, the Hessian matrix becomes:\n\n$H_f(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix has two zero eigenvalues, so the Morse index of the critical point $(0,0)$ is 0."
