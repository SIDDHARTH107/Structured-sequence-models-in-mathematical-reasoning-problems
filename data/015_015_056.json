    "message_2": "The Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is a complex oscillatory chemical reaction that involves multiple chemical species. The number of equilibrium states in a BZ reaction depends on the specific chemical species involved and the reaction conditions. However, we can attempt to estimate the maximum number of equilibrium states based on the information provided.\n\nIn a system with 10 chemical species, each with a maximum concentration of 1.0 M, there are potentially 2^10 = 1024 different combinations of the presence or absence of each species at its maximum concentration. Each of these combinations could represent a different equilibrium state.\n\nHowever, this is an overestimate because not all combinations will be chemically feasible due to conservation of mass and other constraints. Additionally, some combinations may not be stable equilibrium states. The actual number of equilibrium states will be less than 1024, but without more specific information about the chemical species and reaction conditions, it is difficult to provide a more accurate estimate."
