    "message_2": "To find the geodesic between the points (1, 2, 5) and (-2, 3, 13) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we need to parameterize the curve on the surface. Let's use the parameter t, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, and define the curve as:\n\nr(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (x(t), y(t), x(t)^2 + y(t)^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the arc length of the curve. The arc length is given by the integral:\n\nL = ∫[0, 1] √(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + z'(t)^2) dt\n\nSince z = x^2 + y^2, we have z'(t) = 2x(t)x'(t) + 2y(t)y'(t). The arc length becomes:\n\nL = ∫[0, 1] √(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + (2x(t)x'(t) + 2y(t)y'(t))^2) dt\n\nTo minimize the arc length, we apply the Euler-Lagrange equations to x(t) and y(t). The Euler-Lagrange equations are:\n\nd/dt (∂L/∂x'(t)) - ∂L/∂x(t) = 0\nd/dt (∂L/∂y'(t)) - ∂L/∂y(t) = 0\n\nSolving these equations is quite involved and typically requires numerical methods. However, we can gain some insight by considering the projection of the geodesic onto the xy-plane. In the xy-plane, the geodesic will be a straight line connecting the points (1, 2) and (-2, 3). This line can be parameterized as:\n\nx(t) = 1 - 3t\ny(t) = 2 + t\n\nNow we can find the corresponding z(t) using the surface equation:\n\nz(t) = (1 - 3t)^2 + (2 + t)^2\n\nThe parameterized curve on the surface is:\n\nr(t) = (1 - 3t, 2 + t, (1 - 3t)^2 + (2 + t)^2)\n\nThis curve may not be the exact geodesic, but it provides a good approximation. To find the precise geodesic, one would need to solve the Euler-Lagrange equations numerically and adjust the parameterization accordingly."
