    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people, k is the number of people we want to select, and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (total number of people) and k = 3 (number of people to select for the committee).\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\n\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 different ways to select a committee of 3 people from a group of 7 people."
