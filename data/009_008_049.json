    "message_1": "A stretched guitar string of length 1 meter is plucked and creates a wave that travels along the string with a speed of 200 meters per second. The wave equation is given as $y(x,t) = 0.1sin(\\pi x)cos(400\\pi t)$ where $x$ is measured in meters and $t$ is measured in seconds. \n\nWhat is the wavelength, frequency, and period of the wave?",
    "message_2": "To find the wavelength, frequency, and period of the wave, we need to analyze the wave equation given: $y(x,t) = 0.1\\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(400\\pi t)$.\n\nThe general form of a wave equation is $y(x,t) = A\\sin(kx - \\omega t)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wave number, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $t$ is time.\n\nComparing the given equation to the general form, we can see that:\n\n$k = \\pi$ (from the $\\sin(\\pi x)$ term)\n$\\omega = 400\\pi$ (from the $\\cos(400\\pi t)$ term)\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength, frequency, and period using the following relationships:\n\n1. Wavelength ($\\lambda$) is related to the wave number ($k$) as: $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$.\n2. Frequency ($f$) is related to the angular frequency ($\\omega$) as: $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$.\n3. Period ($T$) is the inverse of frequency: $T = \\frac{1}{f}$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the wavelength, frequency, and period:\n\n1. Wavelength: $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi} = 2$ meters.\n2. Frequency: $f = \\frac{400\\pi}{2\\pi} = 200$ Hz.\n3. Period: $T = \\frac{1}{200} = 0.005$ seconds.\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is 2 meters, the frequency is 200 Hz, and the period is 0.005 seconds."
