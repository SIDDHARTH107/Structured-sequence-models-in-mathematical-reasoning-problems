    "message_2": "To find the value of arctan(sqrt(3)), we need to find the angle whose tangent is sqrt(3). \n\nRecall that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. We can use the properties of special triangles to find the angle.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:√3:2. In this case, the side opposite the angle is √3 times the length of the side adjacent to the angle. Therefore, the tangent of the angle is √3/1 = √3.\n\nSo, the angle we are looking for is the one in a 30-60-90 triangle where the tangent is √3. This angle is 60 degrees or π/3 radians.\n\nThus, arctan(sqrt(3)) = π/3 radians."
