    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many students scored an A in Mathematics. \n\n60% of 250 students = (60/100) * 250 = 150 students\n\nNow, let's find out how many students didn't score an A in Mathematics.\n\nTotal students - Students who scored an A = 250 - 150 = 100 students\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a randomly chosen student didn't score an A in Mathematics.\n\nProbability = (Number of students who didn't score an A) / (Total number of students)\nProbability = 100 / 250 = 0.4 or 40%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen student from this school didn't score an A in Mathematics is 40%."
