    "message_2": "Let $P=(x_0, y_0)$ be a rational 2-torsion point on the elliptic curve $E$. Since $P$ is a 2-torsion point, we have $2P = O$, where $O$ is the point at infinity. Using the formulas for point addition on elliptic curves, we can deduce that the slope of the tangent line at $P$ is zero, which means that $P$ is a point of inflection. Thus, the derivative of the curve equation with respect to $x$ must be zero at $x_0$:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + ax + b)$\n\n$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + a$\n\nSince $P$ is a point of inflection, we have $\\frac{dy}{dx}(x_0) = 0$. Therefore,\n\n$0 = 3x_0^2 + a$\n\n$a = -3x_0^2$\n\nNow, substitute this value of $a$ back into the equation of the elliptic curve:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - 3x_0^2x + b$\n\nSince $P=(x_0, y_0)$ is a point on the curve, we can plug in its coordinates:\n\n$y_0^2 = x_0^3 - 3x_0^2x_0 + b$\n\n$b = y_0^2 - x_0^3$\n\nNow, substitute this value of $b$ back into the equation of the elliptic curve:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - 3x_0^2x + y_0^2 - x_0^3$\n\nNow, let $D = x_0y_0$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - \\frac{D^2}{y_0^2}x + \\frac{D^2}{x_0} - \\frac{D^2}{y_0}$\n\nNow, consider the transformation $x' = \\frac{x}{y_0^2}$ and $y' = \\frac{y}{x_0y_0}$. Applying this transformation to the equation above, we get:\n\n$y'^2 = x'^3 - D^2x'$\n\nThus, the elliptic curve $E$ is isomorphic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ to an elliptic curve of the form $y^2 = x^3 - D^2x$ for some $D \\in \\mathbb{Q}$."
