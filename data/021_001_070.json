    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the third equation to get rid of the fraction:\n\n-2x + y - 2z = 0\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1) 3x + 2y - z = 8\n2) 2x - 2y + 4z = -2\n3) -2x + y - 2z = 0\n\nWe will perform Gaussian elimination to solve this system. First, we will eliminate x from equations 2 and 3. To do this, we will multiply equation 1 by 2/3 and subtract it from equation 2, and multiply equation 1 by -2/3 and add it to equation 3:\n\n(2/3) * (1) - (2): (2/3)*(3x + 2y - z) - (2x - 2y + 4z) = (2/3)*8 - (-2)\n(4x + 4y - 2z) - (2x - 2y + 4z) = 16/3 + 2\n2x + 6y - 6z = 22/3\n\n(-2/3) * (1) + (3): (-2/3)*(3x + 2y - z) + (-2x + y - 2z) = (-2/3)*8 + 0\n(-2x - 4/3y + 2/3z) + (-2x + y - 2z) = -16/3\n-4x + 1/3y - 4/3z = -16/3\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1) 3x + 2y - z = 8\n2) 2x + 6y - 6z = 22/3\n3) -4x + 1/3y - 4/3z = -16/3\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from equation 3. To do this, we will multiply equation 1 by 4/3 and add it to equation 3:\n\n(4/3) * (1) + (3): (4/3)*(3x + 2y - z) + (-4x + 1/3y - 4/3z) = (4/3)*8 - 16/3\n(4x + 8/3y - 4/3z) + (-4x + 1/3y - 4/3z) = 32/3 - 16/3\n9y - 8z = 16\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1) 3x + 2y - z = 8\n2) 2x + 6y - 6z = 22/3\n3) 9y - 8z = 16\n\nNext, we will eliminate y from equation 2. To do this, we will multiply equation 3 by 2/3 and subtract it from equation 2:\n\n(2/3) * (3) - (2): (2/3)*(9y - 8z) - (2x + 6y - 6z) = (2/3)*16 - 22/3\n(6y - 16/3z) - (2x + 6y - 6z) = 32/3 - 22/3\n-2x + 2z = 10/3\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1) 3x + 2y - z = 8\n2) -2x + 2z = 10/3\n3) 9y - 8z = 16\n\nNow, we can solve equation 2 for x:\n\n-2x + 2z = 10/3\nx = (2z - 10/3) / 2\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for x back into equation 1:\n\n3((2z - 10/3) / 2) + 2y - z = 8\n(3z - 15) + 2y - z = 8\n2y + 2z = 23\ny + z = 23/2\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for y back into equation 3:\n\n9(23/2 - z) - 8z = 16\n207/2 - 9z - 8z = 16\n-17z = -175/2\nz = 175/34\n\nNow, we will substitute this value of z back into the expression for y:\n\ny + 175/34 = 23/2\ny = 23/2 - 175/34\ny = 161/34\n\nFinally, we will substitute the values of y and z back into the expression for x:\n\nx = (2(175/34) - 10/3) / 2\nx = (350/34 - 20/6) / 2\nx = (350/34 - 68/34) / 2\nx = 282/34 / 2\nx = 141/34\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 141/34\ny = 161/34\nz = 175/34"
