    "message_1": "Suppose two cars are driving towards each other on a narrow road. Each driver must decide whether to swerve to avoid a collision or continue driving straight. If both drivers swerve, they will both be safe, but if one swerves and the other continues straight, the one who continues straight will win the game.\n\nIf the cost of swerving is -1 and the cost of continuing straight is 1, what is the payoff for each driver if both drivers continue straight?",
    "message_2": "If both drivers continue straight, they will collide. In this case, the payoff for each driver is not defined, as the game's rules only provide payoffs for swerving or continuing straight without a collision. The game assumes that a collision is an undesirable outcome that both drivers want to avoid, so assigning a payoff value to a collision would not make sense in the context of this game."
