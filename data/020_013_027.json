    "message_1": "A company produces three types of products with the following production costs per unit:\n- Product A costs $3 to produce\n- Product B costs $4 to produce\n- Product C costs $5 to produce\n\nThe company has a total budget of $1000 to allocate to the production of these products. The demand for each product is as follows:\n- The demand for Product A is at least 200 units\n- The demand for Product B is at least 100 units\n- The demand for Product C is at least 150 units\n\nThe company wants to maximize profit by determining the optimal amount of units to produce for each product, subject to the budget and demand constraints. Assuming that the selling prices are as follows:\n- Product A sells for $5 per unit\n- Product B sells for $6 per unit\n- Product C sells for $7 per unit\n\nWhat is the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's total profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's total profit, we need to determine the profit per unit for each product and allocate the budget accordingly, while also satisfying the demand constraints.\n\nProfit per unit for each product:\n- Product A: $5 - $3 = $2\n- Product B: $6 - $4 = $2\n- Product C: $7 - $5 = $2\n\nSince the profit per unit is the same for all three products, we need to satisfy the demand constraints first and then allocate the remaining budget to produce additional units.\n\n1. Satisfy the demand constraints:\n- Product A: 200 units * $3 = $600\n- Product B: 100 units * $4 = $400\n- Product C: 150 units * $5 = $750\n\n2. Calculate the remaining budget after satisfying the demand constraints:\n- Total budget: $1000\n- Budget used for Product A: $600\n- Budget used for Product B: $400\n- Budget used for Product C: $750\n- Remaining budget: $1000 - $600 - $400 - $750 = -$750\n\nSince the remaining budget is negative, we cannot produce additional units for any product. Therefore, the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's total profit is to produce:\n\n- 200 units of Product A\n- 100 units of Product B\n- 150 units of Product C\n\nThis production plan satisfies the demand constraints and utilizes the entire budget. The total profit for this plan is:\n\n- Profit from Product A: 200 units * $2 = $400\n- Profit from Product B: 100 units * $2 = $200\n- Profit from Product C: 150 units * $2 = $300\n- Total profit: $400 + $200 + $300 = $900"
