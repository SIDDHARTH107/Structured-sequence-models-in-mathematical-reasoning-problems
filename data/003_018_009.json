    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = sin(2x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x.\n\nThe derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2.\n\nSo, using the chain rule, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d(sin(2x))/dx = cos(2x) * d(2x)/dx = cos(2x) * 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\nf'(π/6) = 2 * cos(2 * π/6) = 2 * cos(π/3)\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2, so:\n\nf'(π/6) = 2 * (1/2) = 1\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) = sin(2x) at x = π/6 is 1."
