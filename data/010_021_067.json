    "message_1": "Consider a symplectic manifold $(M, \\omega)$ where $M$ has dimension $4$ and $\\omega$ is a closed non-degenerate 2-form. Let $S$ be a closed $2$-dimensional submanifold of $M$. \n\nIf $\\omega(S) = 4$ and $\\omega(T) = -3$, where $T$ is a closed $2$-dimensional submanifold of $M$ that is homologous to $S$, what is the value of $\\int_S\\omega$?",
    "message_2": "Since $S$ and $T$ are homologous, this means that they represent the same class in the second homology group of the manifold $M$. In particular, this means that there exists a 3-chain $C$ such that $\\partial C = S - T$.\n\nNow, we are given that $\\omega(S) = 4$ and $\\omega(T) = -3$. Since $\\omega$ is a closed 2-form, we have $d\\omega = 0$. Using Stokes' theorem, we can relate the integrals of $\\omega$ over $S$ and $T$:\n\n$$\\int_{S - T} \\omega = \\int_{\\partial C} \\omega = \\int_C d\\omega = 0$$\n\nSince $S - T = \\partial C$, we have:\n\n$$\\int_S \\omega - \\int_T \\omega = 0$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$\\int_S \\omega - (-3) = 4$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\int_S \\omega$ is:\n\n$$\\int_S \\omega = 4 + 3 = \\boxed{7}$$"
