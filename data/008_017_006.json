The inverse of a diagonal matrix is another diagonal matrix with the reciprocals of the diagonal elements:\n\nA^(-1) = | 1/3  0    0  |\n         | 0    1/5  0  |\n         | 0    0    1/4|\n\nNow, multiply A^(-1) with b:\n\nx = | 1/3  0    0  |   | 10 |\n    | 0    1/5  0  | * | 20 |\n    | 0    0    1/4|   | 16 |\n\nx = | (1/3)*10 + 0*20 + 0*16 |\n    | 0*10 + (1/5)*20 + 0*16 |\n    | 0*10 + 0*20 + (1/4)*16 |\n\nx = | 10/3  |\n    |  4    |\n    |  4    |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 10/3\ny = 4\nz = 4"
