    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem related to Contact Geometry and its Applications:\n\nSuppose you have a sphere of radius $r$ centered at the origin in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. You also have a plane passing through the point $(a,b,c)$ such that the sphere touches the plane at that point, with the point of contact being the origin. What is the equation of the plane in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$?",
    "message_2": "Since the sphere is centered at the origin and touches the plane at the point (a, b, c), the normal vector of the plane can be determined by the coordinates of the point (a, b, c). This is because the normal vector is perpendicular to the plane and points directly from the center of the sphere to the point of contact.\n\nThe general equation of a plane in 3D space is given by:\n\nAx + By + Cz + D = 0\n\nwhere A, B, and C are the components of the normal vector, and D is a constant.\n\nIn this case, the normal vector is (a, b, c), so the equation of the plane becomes:\n\nax + by + cz + D = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of D. Since the plane passes through the point (a, b, c), we can substitute these coordinates into the equation:\n\na(a) + b(b) + c(c) + D = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 + D = 0\n\nSince the point (a, b, c) lies on the sphere of radius r, it must satisfy the equation of the sphere:\n\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = r^2\n\nNow we can find the value of D:\n\nD = r^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is:\n\nax + by + cz + (r^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)) = 0"
