    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\n2x + 3y = 13\n\n2x = 13 - 3y\n\nx = (13 - 3y) / 2\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n4x - 5y = -19\n\n4((13 - 3y) / 2) - 5y = -19\n\n2(13 - 3y) - 5y = -19\n\n26 - 6y - 5y = -19\n\n-11y = -45\n\ny = 45 / 11\n\nNow that we have the value for y, we can substitute it back into the expression for x:\n\nx = (13 - 3y) / 2\n\nx = (13 - 3(45 / 11)) / 2\n\nx = (13 - 135 / 11) / 2\n\nx = (-2 / 11) / 2\n\nx = -1 / 11\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -1/11, y = 45/11"
