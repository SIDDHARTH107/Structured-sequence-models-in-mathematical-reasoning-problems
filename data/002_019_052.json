    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral area (curved surface) and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nA_base = π(5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nThe formula for the lateral area of a cone is A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height. In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the slant height is 10 cm.\n\nA_lateral = π(5 cm)(10 cm) = 50π cm²\n\nNow, we add the base area and the lateral area together to find the total surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 25π cm² + 50π cm² = 75π cm²\n\nTo round to the nearest hundredth, we can use the approximation π ≈ 3.14:\n\nA_total ≈ 75(3.14) cm² ≈ 235.5 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 235.5 cm², rounded to the nearest hundredth."
