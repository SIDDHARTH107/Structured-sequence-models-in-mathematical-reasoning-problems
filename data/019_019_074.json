    "message_2": "A Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM) can decide whether a binary input string of length 100 is a palindrome or not using a finite number of states. Here's a high-level description of how the DTM can work:\n\n1. Start at the leftmost symbol of the input string.\n2. Compare the leftmost symbol with the rightmost symbol.\n3. If they are the same, mark both symbols (e.g., with an 'X') and move the head to the next unmarked symbol on both ends.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the middle of the string is reached or a mismatch is found.\n5. If a mismatch is found, reject the input; otherwise, accept it.\n\nTo implement this algorithm, we need the following states:\n\n1. State for moving right to find the first unmarked symbol on the left end.\n2. State for moving left to find the first unmarked symbol on the right end.\n3. State for comparing the symbols.\n4. State for marking the symbols.\n5. State for accepting the input.\n6. State for rejecting the input.\n\nThus, a DTM can decide whether a binary input string of length 100 is a palindrome or not using a maximum of 6 states."
