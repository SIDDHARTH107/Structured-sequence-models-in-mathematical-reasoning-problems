    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to find the values of x when y = 0.\n\n0 = |2x - 4|\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: -(2x - 4) = 0\n-2x + 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nIn both cases, we get the same x-intercept, which is x = 2. So the x-intercept is (2, 0).\n\nNow, let's find the vertex of the absolute value equation.\n\nThe vertex of an absolute value equation is the point where the graph changes direction. In this case, the graph will change direction when the expression inside the absolute value (2x - 4) is equal to 0.\n\n2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-value back into the equation:\n\ny = |2(2) - 4|\ny = |4 - 4|\ny = |0|\ny = 0\n\nSo the vertex of the absolute value equation is (2, 0)."
