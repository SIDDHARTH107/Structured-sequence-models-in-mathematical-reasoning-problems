    "message_2": "Based on the given information, the probability of the basketball player making a free throw shot is 80 successful shots out of 100 attempts. To calculate the probability, divide the number of successful shots by the total number of attempts:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful shots) / (Total number of attempts)\n\nProbability = 80 / 100\n\nProbability = 0.8 or 80%\n\nSo, the probability of the basketball player making a free throw shot is 80%."
