    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem, we need to find the cycle index of the dihedral group D_6, which is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon (including rotations and reflections).\n\nThe dihedral group D_6 has 12 elements: 6 rotations (0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°) and 6 reflections (about the axes of symmetry of the hexagon).\n\nLet's find the cycle index for each of these elements:\n\n1. For the 0° rotation, all 6 beads are in their own cycle. The cycle index is (a_1)^6.\n2. For the 60° and 300° rotations, there is one cycle of length 6. The cycle index is (a_6)^1 for both.\n3. For the 120° and 240° rotations, there are two cycles of length 3. The cycle index is (a_3)^2 for both.\n4. For the 180° rotation, there are three cycles of length 2. The cycle index is (a_2)^3.\n5. For the 6 reflections, each reflection has three cycles of length 2. The cycle index is (a_2)^3 for each.\n\nNow, we can compute the average cycle index for the dihedral group D_6:\n\nZ(D_6) = (1/12)[(a_1)^6 + 2(a_6)^1 + 2(a_3)^2 + (a_2)^3 + 6(a_2)^3]\n\nTo find the number of distinct necklaces with 6 beads of different colors, we substitute a_i = 6 for all i in the cycle index:\n\nN = (1/12)[(6^1)^6 + 2(6^6)^1 + 2(6^3)^2 + (6^2)^3 + 6(6^2)^3]\nN = (1/12)[46656 + 2(46656) + 2(729) + 7776 + 6(7776)]\nN = (1/12)[46656 + 93312 + 1458 + 7776 + 46656]\nN = (1/12)[204858]\n\nTherefore, there are 17,071 distinct necklaces that can be made using 6 beads of different colors, where rotations and reflections are considered equivalent."
