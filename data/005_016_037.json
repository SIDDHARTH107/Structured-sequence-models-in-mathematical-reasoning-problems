    "message_1": "A study was conducted to compare the final exam scores of students in three different courses - Math, Science, and English. The mean scores and standard deviations for each course are obtained as follows:\n\nMath: Mean = 73, SD = 8\nScience: Mean = 81, SD = 12\nEnglish: Mean = 77, SD = 10\n\nA new student has scored 75 on the final exam. Determine which course the student is most likely to belong to. Use discriminant analysis assuming equal prior probabilities.",
    "message_2": "To determine which course the student is most likely to belong to, we will use the discriminant function for each course and compare the values. The discriminant function is given by:\n\nD(x) = (x - μ) / σ\n\nwhere x is the student's score, μ is the mean score for the course, and σ is the standard deviation for the course.\n\nFor Math:\nD_Math = (75 - 73) / 8 = 2 / 8 = 0.25\n\nFor Science:\nD_Science = (75 - 81) / 12 = -6 / 12 = -0.5\n\nFor English:\nD_English = (75 - 77) / 10 = -2 / 10 = -0.2\n\nNow we compare the discriminant values:\n\nD_Math = 0.25\nD_Science = -0.5\nD_English = -0.2\n\nThe highest discriminant value is for Math (0.25), so the student is most likely to belong to the Math course."
