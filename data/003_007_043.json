    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we will use the law of cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 12 cm in this case. Let's denote the sides as a = 8 cm, b = 10 cm, and c = 12 cm, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C respectively. We want to find angle C.\n\nThe law of cosines states that:\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n12² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(C)\n\nSolving for cos(C):\ncos(C) = (8² + 10² - 12²) / (2 * 8 * 10)\ncos(C) = (64 + 100 - 144) / 160\ncos(C) = 20 / 160\ncos(C) = 1/8\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C whose cosine is 1/8. We can use the inverse cosine function (also written as arccos or cos^(-1)) to find the angle:\n\nC = arccos(1/8)\nC ≈ 82.82°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 82.82°."
