If so, give the mapping that shows the isomorphism. If not, explain why they are not isomorphic.",

One possible mapping that shows the isomorphism is:\n\n1 -> a\n2 -> b\n3 -> c\n4 -> d\n\nWith this mapping, the adjacency relationships are preserved:\n\n- 1 is adjacent to 2, 3 in Graph A, and a is adjacent to b, c in Graph B.\n- 2 is adjacent to 1, 4 in Graph A, and b is adjacent to a, d in Graph B.\n- 3 is adjacent to 1, 4 in Graph A, and c is adjacent to a, d in Graph B.\n- 4 is adjacent to 2, 3 in Graph A, and d is adjacent to b, c in Graph B.\n\nSince there is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices and edges of Graph A and Graph B that preserves adjacency, they are isomorphic."
