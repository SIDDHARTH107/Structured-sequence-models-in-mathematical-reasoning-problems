    "message_2": "To find the degree and genus of the curve X, we first need to determine the degree of the equation defining the curve. The given equation is y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2, which is a homogeneous equation of degree 3 (since the highest degree term is x^3).\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the genus of a smooth projective algebraic curve, which is given by:\n\ngenus = (degree - 1)(degree - 2) / 2\n\nIn our case, the degree is 3, so we have:\n\ngenus = (3 - 1)(3 - 2) / 2 = (2)(1) / 2 = 1\n\nThus, the degree of the curve X is 3, and the genus is 1."
