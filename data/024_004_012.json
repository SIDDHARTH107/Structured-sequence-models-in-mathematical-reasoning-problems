    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2). Then, we can find the tangent vectors:\n\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we can find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = ru • ru = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = ru • rv = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = rv • rv = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we find the normal vector N:\n\nN = ru x rv = (2u, -2v, -1)\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • ruu = (2u, -2v, -1) • (0, 0, 2) = 2\nM = N • ruv = (2u, -2v, -1) • (0, -1, 2u) = 2u^2 - 2v^2\nN = N • rvv = (2u, -2v, -1) • (0, 0, 2) = 2\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/2) * (1/(EG - F^2)) * (EN + GL - 2FM)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nL = 2\nM = 2(1)^2 - 2(1)^2 = 0\nN = 2\n\nNow, we can find H:\n\nH = (1/2) * (1/(5*5 - 4^2)) * (2*5 + 2*5 - 2*0)\nH = (1/2) * (1/9) * (20)\nH = 10/9\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2) is H = 10/9."
