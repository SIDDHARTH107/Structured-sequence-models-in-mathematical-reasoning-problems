Suppose that $f$ has exactly $m$ critical points of index $i$ and let $b_i$ denote the $i$-th Betti number of $M$. Prove that\n$$\nb_i\\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{i}(-1)^{i-j}m_j,\n$$\nwhere $m_j$ is the number of critical points of index $j$. Now consider the following particular case: let $M$ be the torus $T^2$ and $f$ be given by $f(x,y)=\\sin(x)+\\sin(y)$. Find all the critical points of $f$ and compute the Betti numbers of $T^2$. Use Morse inequalities to obtain a sharp inequality for each Betti number.",
    "message_2": "To prove the Morse inequality, we will use the Morse complex. Recall that the Morse complex is a chain complex $(C_*,\\partial_*)$ with $C_i = \\mathbb{Z}^{m_i}$ and $\\partial_i : C_i \\to C_{i-1}$ is the boundary operator. The homology of the Morse complex is isomorphic to the singular homology of $M$, so the Betti numbers $b_i$ are the ranks of the homology groups $H_i(C_*)$.\n\nNow, consider the filtration of $M$ by the sublevel sets of $f$: $M_i = f^{-1}((-\\infty, c_i])$, where $c_i$ is the value of $f$ at the $i$-th critical point. The Morse inequalities relate the Betti numbers of $M$ to the ranks of the homology groups of the pairs $(M_i, M_{i-1})$. By the excision theorem, we have\n$$\nH_j(M_i, M_{i-1}) \\cong H_j(M, M_{i-1}),\n$$\nand by the long exact sequence of the pair $(M_i, M_{i-1})$, we get\n$$\n\\cdots \\to H_j(M_{i-1}) \\to H_j(M_i) \\to H_j(M_i, M_{i-1}) \\to H_{j-1}(M_{i-1}) \\to \\cdots.\n$$\nSince $H_j(M_i) \\cong H_j(M)$ for all $i$, we can rewrite the long exact sequence as\n$$\n\\cdots \\to H_j(M) \\to H_j(M) \\to H_j(M, M_{i-1}) \\to H_{j-1}(M) \\to \\cdots.\n$$\nNow, we can apply the rank-nullity theorem to the maps $H_j(M) \\to H_j(M)$ and $H_{j-1}(M) \\to H_{j-1}(M)$, which gives us\n$$\nb_j - b_{j-1} = \\text{rank}(H_j(M, M_{i-1})) - \\text{rank}(H_{j-1}(M, M_{i-1})).\n$$\nSumming over all $j$ from $0$ to $i$, we obtain the Morse inequality\n$$\nb_i \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{i}(-1)^{i-j}m_j.\n$$\n\nNow, let's consider the torus $T^2$ with the Morse function $f(x,y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y)$. To find the critical points, we compute the gradient:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x,y) = (\\cos(x), \\cos(y)).\n$$\nThe critical points occur when $\\nabla f(x,y) = (0,0)$. This happens when $x,y \\in \\{0, \\pi\\}$, so there are four critical points: $(0,0)$, $(0,\\pi)$, $(\\pi,0)$, and $(\\pi,\\pi)$. The Hessian matrix of $f$ is\n$$\nHf(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(x) & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\sin(y) \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAt the critical points, the Hessian matrices are\n$$\nHf(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad Hf(0,\\pi) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad Hf(\\pi,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad Hf(\\pi,\\pi) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe indices of these critical points are 0, 1, 1, and 2, respectively. Thus, we have $m_0 = 1$, $m_1 = 2$, and $m_2 = 1$.\n\nThe Betti numbers of the torus $T^2$ are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Using the Morse inequalities, we obtain\n$$\nb_0 \\geq m_0 = 1, \\quad b_1 \\geq m_1 - m_0 = 1, \\quad b_2 \\geq m_2 - m_1 + m_0 = 0.\n$$\nThese inequalities are sharp, as they are equalities in this case."
