    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(2x + 3y) * 2 = 11 * 2\n4x + 6y = 22\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 22\n4x - 5y = -22\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 22 - (-22)\n4x + 6y - 4x + 5y = 44\n11y = 44\n\nNow, divide by 11 to find the value of y:\n\ny = 44 / 11\ny = 4\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into either of the original equations to find the value of x. I'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n2x + 3(4) = 11\n2x + 12 = 11\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n2x = -1\n\nNow, divide by 2 to find the value of x:\n\nx = -1 / 2\nx = -0.5\n\nSo the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = -0.5 and y = 4."
