    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material has an initial mass of 50 grams and a half-life of 10 days. What is the mass of the material after 20 days?",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of the radioactive material after 20 days, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 50 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 20 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 50 * (1/2)^(20 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 50 * (1/2)^2\n\nFinal mass = 50 * (1/4)\n\nFinal mass = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 20 days, the mass of the radioactive material will be 12.5 grams."
