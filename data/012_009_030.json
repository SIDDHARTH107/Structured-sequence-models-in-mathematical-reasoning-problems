    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and the following degree sequence: 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1. Is this degree sequence possible? If yes, draw a possible graph that corresponds to this degree sequence. If not, explain why it is not possible.",
    "message_2": "Yes, this degree sequence is possible. To show this, we can construct a graph with the given degree sequence. Here's one possible graph:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n2. Assign the degrees as follows: deg(A) = 3, deg(B) = 3, deg(C) = 2, deg(D) = 2, deg(E) = 2, deg(F) = 1, deg(G) = 1, and deg(H) = 1.\n3. Connect the vertices according to their degrees:\n   - Connect A to B, C, and D.\n   - Connect B to A, E, and F.\n   - Connect C to A and G.\n   - Connect D to A and H.\n   - Connect E to B.\n   - Connect F to B.\n   - Connect G to C.\n   - Connect H to D.\n\nThe resulting graph has the desired degree sequence and looks like this:\n\n```\n    A---B\n   /|   |\\\n  / |   | \\\n C  |   |  E\n  \\ |   | /\n   \\|   |/\n    D---F\n     \\ /\n      G\n      |\n      H\n```\n\nSo, the given degree sequence is possible."
