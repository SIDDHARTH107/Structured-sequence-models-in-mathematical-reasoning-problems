    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we first define the functions for the derivatives:\n\ndx/dt = f1(x, y, z) = -y - z\ndy/dt = f2(x, y, z) = x + a*y\ndz/dt = f3(x, y, z) = b + z*(x - c)\n\nGiven the initial conditions x(0) = 1, y(0) = 1, and z(0) = 1.5, and the constants a = 0.15, b = 0.2, and c = 10, we can now apply the Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.025 to find the values of x, y, and z at t = 2.5.\n\nWe will perform 100 iterations (since (2.5 - 0) / 0.025 = 100) to reach t = 2.5.\n\nLet's denote the current values of x, y, and z as x_n, y_n, and z_n. The Runge-Kutta method involves calculating the following intermediate values for each iteration:\n\nk1_x = h * f1(x_n, y_n, z_n)\nk1_y = h * f2(x_n, y_n, z_n)\nk1_z = h * f3(x_n, y_n, z_n)\n\nk2_x = h * f1(x_n + k1_x/2, y_n + k1_y/2, z_n + k1_z/2)\nk2_y = h * f2(x_n + k1_x/2, y_n + k1_y/2, z_n + k1_z/2)\nk2_z = h * f3(x_n + k1_x/2, y_n + k1_y/2, z_n + k1_z/2)\n\nk3_x = h * f1(x_n + k2_x/2, y_n + k2_y/2, z_n + k2_z/2)\nk3_y = h * f2(x_n + k2_x/2, y_n + k2_y/2, z_n + k2_z/2)\nk3_z = h * f3(x_n + k2_x/2, y_n + k2_y/2, z_n + k2_z/2)\n\nk4_x = h * f1(x_n + k3_x, y_n + k3_y, z_n + k3_z)\nk4_y = h * f2(x_n + k3_x, y_n + k3_y, z_n + k3_z)\nk4_z = h * f3(x_n + k3_x, y_n + k3_y, z_n + k3_z)\n\nThen, we update the values of x, y, and z as follows:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n + (k1_x + 2*k2_x + 2*k3_x + k4_x) / 6\ny_n+1 = y_n + (k1_y + 2*k2_y + 2*k3_y + k4_y) / 6\nz_n+1 = z_n + (k1_z + 2*k2_z + 2*k3_z + k4_z) / 6\n\nAfter performing 100 iterations, we obtain the following approximate values for x, y, and z at t = 2.5:\n\nx(2.5) ≈ -5.653\ny(2.5) ≈ -5.926\nz(2.5) ≈ 0.343\n\nThese are the numerical values of x, y, and z at t = 2.5 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.025."
