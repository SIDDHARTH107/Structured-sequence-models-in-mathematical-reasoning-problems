    "message_2": "The union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in either A or B or in both. In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nA set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C. In this case, since every element of A and B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can say that A ∪ B is a superset of both sets A and B."
