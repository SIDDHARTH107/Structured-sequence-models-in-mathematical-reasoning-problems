    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products AxB and BxA.\n\nAxB = {(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}\n\nBxA = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(AxB)⋃(BxA) = {(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)}\n\n(BxA)⋃(AxB) = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}\n\nAs we can see, the sets (AxB)⋃(BxA) and (BxA)⋃(AxB) are actually equal:\n\n(AxB)⋃(BxA) = (BxA)⋃(AxB)\n\nThis means that the Cartesian product of two sets is commutative with respect to union. The initial claim that they are not equal is incorrect."
