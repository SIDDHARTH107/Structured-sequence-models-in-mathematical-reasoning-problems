The data is presented below:\n\n| Student | Hours of Study (X) | Test Grade (Y) |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| 1       | 3                  | 65                   |\n| 2       | 4                  | 70                   |\n| 3       | 6                  | 82                   |\n| 4       | 5                  | 75                   |\n| 5       | 2                  | 60                   |\n| 6       | 7                  | 90                   |\n| 7       | 9                  | 97                   |\n| 8       | 8                  | 92                   |\n| 9       | 1                  | 52                   |\n| 10      | 5                  | 72                   |\n\nUsing correlation analysis, determine the relationship between the hours of study and the grades obtained.",
    "message_2": "To determine the relationship between the hours of study and the grades obtained, we will use the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient is:\n\nr = Σ[(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean)] / sqrt[Σ(Xi - X_mean)^2 * Σ(Yi - Y_mean)^2]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean of X (hours of study) and Y (test grade):\n\nX_mean = (3 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 5) / 10 = 50 / 10 = 5\nY_mean = (65 + 70 + 82 + 75 + 60 + 90 + 97 + 92 + 52 + 72) / 10 = 755 / 10 = 75.5\n\nNext, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator = Σ[(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean)]\nDenominator = sqrt[Σ(Xi - X_mean)^2 * Σ(Yi - Y_mean)^2]\n\nFor each student, we will calculate (Xi - X_mean), (Yi - Y_mean), (Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean), (Xi - X_mean)^2, and (Yi - Y_mean)^2:\n\n| Student | (Xi - X_mean) | (Yi - Y_mean) | (Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean) | (Xi - X_mean)^2 | (Yi - Y_mean)^2 |\n|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 1       | -2            | -10.5         | 21                         | 4              | 110.25         |\n| 2       | -1            | -5.5          | 5.5                        | 1              | 30.25          |\n| 3       | 1             | 6.5           | 6.5                        | 1              | 42.25          |\n| 4       | 0             | -0.5          | 0                          | 0              | 0.25           |\n| 5       | -3            | -15.5         | 46.5                       | 9              | 240.25         |\n| 6       | 2             | 14.5          | 29                         | 4              | 210.25         |\n| 7       | 4             | 21.5          | 86                         | 16             | 462.25         |\n| 8       | 3             | 16.5          | 49.5                       | 9              | 272.25         |\n| 9       | -4            | -23.5         | 94                         | 16             | 552.25         |\n| 10      | 0             | -3.5          | 0                          | 0              | 12.25          |\n\nNow, we will sum up the last three columns:\n\nΣ(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean) = 21 + 5.5 + 6.5 + 0 + 46.5 + 29 + 86 + 49.5 + 94 + 0 = 338\nΣ(Xi - X_mean)^2 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 9 + 4 + 16 + 9 + 16 + 0 = 60\nΣ(Yi - Y_mean)^2 = 110.25 + 30.25 + 42.25 + 0.25 + 240.25 + 210.25 + 462.25 + 272.25 + 552.25 + 12.25 = 1932.5\n\nNow we can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n\nr = 338 / sqrt(60 * 1932.5) = 338 / sqrt(116000) ≈ 0.976\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is approximately 0.976, which indicates a strong positive correlation between the hours of study and the grades obtained. This means that as the hours of study increase, the test grades also tend to increase."
