    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have 3 vertices (1, 2, and 3), 2 edges ({1, 2} and {2, 3}), and no faces (since there is no complete triangle formed by the edges).\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic is:\n\nχ = 3 - 2 + 0 = 1"
