    "message_2": "To show that there exist exactly three non-isomorphic groups of order 10, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let the order of G be 10, which can be factored as 2 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, G has a 2-Sylow subgroup P of order 2 and a 5-Sylow subgroup Q of order 5.\n\nSince the order of P is 2, P is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_2. Similarly, since the order of Q is 5, Q is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_5. Now, we will consider the possible structures of G.\n\n1. G is cyclic: In this case, G is isomorphic to Z_10, the cyclic group of order 10. This is one possible non-isomorphic group of order 10.\n\n2. G is a direct product of P and Q: In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of Z_2 and Z_5, which is Z_2 × Z_5. Since Z_2 and Z_5 are both cyclic and have relatively prime orders, their direct product is also cyclic, and thus isomorphic to Z_10. This case does not give us a new non-isomorphic group.\n\n3. G is a semidirect product of P and Q: In this case, G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Z_2 and Z_5. Since the order of the automorphism group of Z_5 is 4, there are two possible non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_2 to Aut(Z_5). One of these homomorphisms corresponds to the identity automorphism, which gives us the direct product case (Z_2 × Z_5, isomorphic to Z_10). The other non-trivial homomorphism gives us a new non-isomorphic group, which is the dihedral group D_10 of order 10.\n\nThus, there exist exactly three non-isomorphic groups of order 10: Z_10, Z_2 × Z_5 (which is isomorphic to Z_10), and D_10.\n\nTo determine which of these groups G is isomorphic to, we need more information about the structure of G. If G is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to Z_10. If G is not cyclic but has a normal 5-Sylow subgroup, then G is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_5 (which is isomorphic to Z_10). If G is not cyclic and does not have a normal 5-Sylow subgroup, then G is isomorphic to D_10."
