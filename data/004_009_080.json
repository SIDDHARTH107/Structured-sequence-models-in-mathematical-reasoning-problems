    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) using the product rule, we need to take the derivative of each function separately and then add their products. The product rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x) * h(x), then the derivative f'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x).\n\nLet g(x) = (2x + 1) and h(x) = (3x - 4).\n\nFirst, find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d(2x + 1)/dx = 2\nh'(x) = d(3x - 4)/dx = 3\n\nNow, apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x)\nf'(x) = (2) * (3x - 4) + (2x + 1) * (3)\n\nNow, distribute and simplify:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 8 + 6x + 3\nf'(x) = 12x - 5\n\nSo, the derivative f'(x) = 12x - 5."
