    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of material used, we need to minimize the surface area of the can while maintaining the volume of 180 cubic inches. The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nA = 2πrh + 2πr^2\n\nWe are given the volume formula:\n\nV = πr^2h = 180\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of r:\n\nh = 180 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area formula:\n\nA(r) = 2πr(180 / (πr^2)) + 2πr^2\nA(r) = 360/r + 2πr^2\n\nTo find the minimum surface area, we need to find the critical points of A(r) by taking the derivative with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\nA'(r) = -360/r^2 + 4πr\n\nNow, set A'(r) = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = -360/r^2 + 4πr\n360/r^2 = 4πr\n360 = 4πr^3\nr^3 = 360 / (4π)\nr^3 = 90 / π\nr = (90 / π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 180 / (πr^2)\nh = 180 / (π(90 / π)^(2/3))\nh = 180 / (90^(2/3))\n\nNow, we have the dimensions of the can that requires the least amount of material:\n\nr ≈ (90 / π)^(1/3) inches\nh ≈ 180 / (90^(2/3)) inches"
