    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we'll first cross-multiply:\n\n(2x + 3)(3) = (5x - 1)(4)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n6x + 9 = 20x - 4\n\nNext, we'll isolate the variable x by moving all the terms with x to one side of the equation:\n\n6x - 20x = -4 - 9\n\n-14x = -13\n\nNow, divide by -14 to solve for x:\n\nx = -13 / -14\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\nx = 13/14"
