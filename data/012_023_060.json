    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. The clique number of a graph G is the size of the largest clique in G.\n\nIn this case, the order of the graph G is 7 (n = 7), which means there are 7 vertices in the graph. The clique number of G is given as 3, which means the largest clique in the graph has 3 vertices.\n\nSince the maximum size of a clique in the graph is 3, the maximum number of nodes that can be present in a clique in this graph is 3."
