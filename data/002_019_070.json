    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (the area of the cone's curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, and l is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height, as the radius, height, and slant height form a right triangle:\n\nl^2 = r^2 + h^2\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 6 cm and the height (h) is 8 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nl^2 = 6^2 + 8^2\nl^2 = 36 + 64\nl^2 = 100\nl = √100\nl = 10 cm\n\nNow that we have the slant height, we can find the surface area of the cone:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\nSurface Area = π(6)(6 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(6)(16)\nSurface Area = 96π cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is 96π cm^2, or approximately 301.59 cm^2."
