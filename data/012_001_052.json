    "message_2": "To use Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to know the connections between the nodes. Since the graph is not provided, I will assume a possible configuration for the graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges:\n\n1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.\n2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.\n3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.\n4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.\n5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between node 1 and node 5:\n\n1. Set the distance of the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distance of all other nodes to infinity. Mark all nodes as unvisited.\n\nDistances: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞}\nVisited: {1: False, 2: False, 3: False, 4: False, 5: False}\n\n2. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 1) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (nodes 2 and 3) by adding the weight of the edge (1 in this case, since all edges have equal weight).\n\nDistances: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: ∞, 5: ∞}\nVisited: {1: True, 2: False, 3: False, 4: False, 5: False}\n\n3. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 2) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (nodes 3 and 4) by adding the weight of the edge (1).\n\nDistances: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: ∞}\nVisited: {1: True, 2: True, 3: False, 4: False, 5: False}\n\n4. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 3) and mark it as visited. Update the distance of its neighbor (node 5) by adding the weight of the edge (1).\n\nDistances: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2}\nVisited: {1: True, 2: True, 3: True, 4: False, 5: False}\n\n5. Since node 5 is the destination, we can stop the algorithm here. The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 has a length of 2.\n\nSo, the length of the shortest path between node 1 and node 5 is 2."
