    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere inscribed within a cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere. Since the sphere is inscribed within the cube, its diameter is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 6 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the radius of the sphere. The radius is half of the diameter:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 27 cm^3\nV = 36π cm^3\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14, we get:\n\nV ≈ 36 * 3.14 cm^3\nV ≈ 113.04 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed within the cube is approximately 113.04 cubic centimeters."
