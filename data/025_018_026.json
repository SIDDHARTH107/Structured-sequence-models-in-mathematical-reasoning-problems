    "message_2": "1. To show that C is smooth away from the origin, we need to check that the gradient of the function defining the curve is non-zero at all points other than the origin. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y.\n\nLet $F(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 6xyz$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 6xz$\n\nAt the origin (0, 0), both partial derivatives are zero, so the gradient is zero. However, away from the origin, at least one of x or y is non-zero. If x is non-zero, then $3x^2 - 6yz$ is non-zero, and if y is non-zero, then $3y^2 - 6xz$ is non-zero. Therefore, the gradient is non-zero away from the origin, and C is smooth away from the origin.\n\n2. To find the tangent line to C at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the gradient at that point. Plugging x = 1 and y = 1 into the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 3(1)^2 - 6(1)(1) = -3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3(1)^2 - 6(1)(1) = -3$\n\nThe gradient at the point (1, 1, 2) is (-3, -3). The tangent line to C at this point is given by the parametric equation:\n\n$x = 1 - 3t$\n\n$y = 1 - 3t$\n\n$z = 2$\n\n3. To find the equation of the tangent plane to C at the point (1, 1, 2), we use the gradient as the normal vector to the plane. The equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n\n$(-3)(x - 1) + (-3)(y - 1) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$-3x - 3y + 6 = 0$\n\nSo the equation of the tangent plane to C at the point (1, 1, 2) is:\n\n$3x + 3y = 6$"
