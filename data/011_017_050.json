    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square with the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSince the first row is fixed, we only need to consider the possible arrangements for the second and third rows. Let's denote the first row as (1, 2, 3).\n\nFor the second row, there are two possible arrangements:\n1. (2, 3, 1)\n2. (3, 1, 2)\n\nFor each of these arrangements, there is only one possible arrangement for the third row that satisfies the Latin square conditions:\n\n1. If the second row is (2, 3, 1), the third row must be (3, 1, 2).\n2. If the second row is (3, 1, 2), the third row must be (2, 3, 1).\n\nSo, there are 2 different 3x3 Latin squares that can be formed with the first row being (1, 2, 3)."
