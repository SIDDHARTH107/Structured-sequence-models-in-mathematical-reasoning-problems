    "message_2": "To determine whether the group G of order 48 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n2. n_3 divides 16 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16 and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Since P and Q are both normal in G and their intersection is trivial (only the identity element), G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is a cyclic group of order 48. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C48.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3, which is normal in G. However, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, so none of them are normal in G. Since Q is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of a Sylow 2-subgroup P and Q. This gives us a non-abelian group of order 48. There are 14 such non-abelian groups, so G could be isomorphic to one of them.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is not possible because there cannot be a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups simultaneously.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups, so none of them are normal in G. This case does not give us any new information about the structure of G.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 48 could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C48, one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, or the alternating group A4 × C4. To determine which one it is, we would need more information about the specific group G."
