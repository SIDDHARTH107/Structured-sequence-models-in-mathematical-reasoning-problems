They want to use a discriminant function to determine which school's applicants are more likely to be admitted. The following table shows the mean GPAs and entrance exam scores for each school, as well as the covariance matrix for the two variables.\n\n| School | Mean GPA | Mean entrance exam score |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 3.2 | 150 |\n| B | 3.6 | 170 |\n\nCovariance matrix:\n\n|  | GPA | Entrance exam |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GPA | 0.1 | 8 |\n| Entrance exam | 8 | 100 |\n\nUsing this information, calculate the discriminant function for these two schools and predict which school's applicants are more likely to be admitted if the cutoff score is set at a discriminant value of 0.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the discriminant function, we first need to find the inverse of the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is given as:\n\n|  | GPA | Entrance exam |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GPA | 0.1 | 8 |\n| Entrance exam | 8 | 100 |\n\nThe determinant of the covariance matrix is:\ndet = (0.1 * 100) - (8 * 8) = 10 - 64 = -54\n\nThe inverse of the covariance matrix is (1/det) * adjoint(matrix), where adjoint(matrix) is the matrix obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements. So, the inverse covariance matrix is:\n\n|  | GPA | Entrance exam |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GPA | -100/54 | 8/54 |\n| Entrance exam | 8/54 | -0.1/54 |\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in means for GPA and entrance exam scores between the two schools:\n\nΔGPA = 3.6 - 3.2 = 0.4\nΔEntranceExam = 170 - 150 = 20\n\nNext, we multiply the inverse covariance matrix by the difference in means:\n\n|  | GPA | Entrance exam |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GPA | -100/54 * 0.4 + 8/54 * 20 | -0.1/54 * 0.4 + 8/54 * 20 |\n\nThis results in:\n\n|  | GPA | Entrance exam |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GPA | -40/54 + 160/54 | -0.4/54 + 160/54 |\n\nSimplifying the matrix:\n\n|  | GPA | Entrance exam |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GPA | 120/54 | 159.6/54 |\n\nNow, we can calculate the discriminant function value (D) for each school:\n\nD_A = (120/54) * 3.2 + (159.6/54) * 150\nD_B = (120/54) * 3.6 + (159.6/54) * 170\n\nD_A = 2.222 * 3.2 + 2.956 * 150 ≈ 7.111 + 443.333 ≈ 450.444\nD_B = 2.222 * 3.6 + 2.956 * 170 ≈ 8.000 + 500.556 ≈ 508.556\n\nSince the cutoff score is set at a discriminant value of 0, we can see that both schools' applicants have discriminant values greater than 0. However, School B's applicants have a higher discriminant value (508.556) compared to School A's applicants (450.444). Therefore, applicants from School B are more likely to be admitted."
