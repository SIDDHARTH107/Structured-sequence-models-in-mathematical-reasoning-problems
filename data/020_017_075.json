    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 over the interval [1, 4], we can use calculus techniques. First, we need to find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 and x = 3 are the critical points.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [1, 4] and the critical points to determine the minimum value of the function.\n\nf(1) = 1^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = 3^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(4) = 4^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6\n\nThe minimum value of the function over the interval [1, 4] occurs at x = 3, and the minimum value is f(3) = 2."
