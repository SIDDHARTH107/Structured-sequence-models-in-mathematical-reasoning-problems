A Möbius transformation is a function of the form:\n\nf(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d),\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex numbers and ad - bc ≠ 0.\n\nWe want to find a Möbius transformation that maps the points -i, 0, and i to the upper half plane. Let's denote these points as z1 = -i, z2 = 0, and z3 = i.\n\nFirst, let's find a Möbius transformation that maps z1, z2, and z3 to 0, 1, and ∞, respectively. This transformation can be written as:\n\nf(z) = (z - z1) / (z - z3).\n\nNow, we substitute the values of z1 and z3:\n\nf(z) = (z + i) / (z - i).\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse of this transformation, which maps 0, 1, and ∞ back to -i, 0, and i, respectively. The inverse of a Möbius transformation can be found by solving for z in terms of f(z):\n\nz = (d * f(z) - b) / (-c * f(z) + a).\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = i, c = 1, and d = -i. Substituting these values, we get:\n\nz = (-i * f(z) - i) / (-f(z) + 1).\n\nNow, we have the conformal mapping that transforms the imaginary axis from -1 to 1 to the upper half plane:\n\nz = (-i * f(z) - i) / (-f(z) + 1)."
