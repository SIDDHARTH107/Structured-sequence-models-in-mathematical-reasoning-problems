    "message_1": "What is the probability of a burglary occurring in a specific neighborhood in a given month, if historical statistics show that on average there are 5 burglaries per year and 1 burglary occurred 2 months ago?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, burglaries) occurring in a fixed interval of time (a month).\n\nThe average number of burglaries per month is 5 burglaries per year / 12 months = 5/12 ≈ 0.4167 burglaries per month.\n\nLet X be the number of burglaries in a given month. We want to find the probability P(X ≥ 1), which is the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the specific neighborhood in a given month.\n\nUsing the Poisson distribution formula, we can find the probability of no burglaries occurring in a given month:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-λ) * λ^X) / X! = (e^(-0.4167) * 0.4167^0) / 0! ≈ 0.6591\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one burglary occurring in a given month:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.6591 ≈ 0.3409\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the specific neighborhood in a given month is approximately 34.09%, regardless of when the last burglary occurred."
