    "message_2": "To find the zeroes of the function f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nz^2 - 2z + 2 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the zeroes:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nz = (2 ± √(4 - 8)) / 2\nz = (2 ± √(-4)) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression under the square root:\n\n√(-4) = √(4 * -1) = √(4) * √(-1) = 2i\n\nSo, the zeroes are:\n\nz = (2 ± 2i) / 2\nz = 1 ± i\n\nNow, we need to check if these zeroes are inside the unit circle. The unit circle is defined by the equation |z| = 1. To check if a complex number is inside the unit circle, we need to check if its magnitude is less than 1.\n\nFor z = 1 + i:\n\n|1 + i| = √((1)^2 + (1)^2) = √(1 + 1) = √2\n\nFor z = 1 - i:\n\n|1 - i| = √((1)^2 + (-1)^2) = √(1 + 1) = √2\n\nBoth zeroes have a magnitude of √2, which is greater than 1. Therefore, there are no zeroes of the function f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2 inside the unit circle."
