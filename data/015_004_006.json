    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is shaped like a heart, and its area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a cardioid:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the cardioid. In this case, the radius is given as 1/4.\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * (1/4)^2\nArea = (1/2) * π * (1/16)\nArea = π/32\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set with a radius of 1/4 is π/32."
