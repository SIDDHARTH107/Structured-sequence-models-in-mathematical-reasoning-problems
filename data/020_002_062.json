    "message_1": "A farmer wants to enclose a rectangular plot of land that borders a river using 100 meters of fencing. What are the dimensions (length and width) of the plot that will give the farmer the maximum possible area? Assume that the side of the plot adjacent to the river doesn't need a fence.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the plot parallel to the river be x meters, and the width perpendicular to the river be y meters. Since the farmer has 100 meters of fencing, the total fencing used for the two widths and one length is:\n\nx + 2y = 100\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for x:\n\nx = 100 - 2y\n\nThe area of the rectangular plot is given by:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nSubstitute the expression for x from above:\n\nArea = (100 - 2y) * y = 100y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to y and set it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dy = 100 - 4y = 0\n\nSolving for y:\n\n4y = 100\ny = 25\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding value of x:\n\nx = 100 - 2y = 100 - 2(25) = 50\n\nSo, the dimensions of the plot that will give the farmer the maximum possible area are 50 meters in length (parallel to the river) and 25 meters in width (perpendicular to the river)."
