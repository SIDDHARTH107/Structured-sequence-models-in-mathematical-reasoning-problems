    "message_1": "Here is a possible question for a math student to solve:\n\nIn the Traveler's Dilemma, two airline companies offer a reward for the lowest fare provided by the two companies. The fare must be a positive integer not exceeding 100. The two travelers agree on a shared reward that is the average of the two fares they choose. What fare should each traveler choose if they want to optimize their reward and why?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, both travelers want to maximize their reward. Let's denote the fares chosen by the two travelers as A and B, where A and B are positive integers not exceeding 100. The shared reward will be the average of the two fares, i.e., (A + B) / 2.\n\nSince both travelers want to maximize their reward, they will try to choose the highest possible fare. However, they also know that the other traveler is trying to do the same. If one traveler chooses 100, the other traveler can choose 99, and the shared reward will be (100 + 99) / 2 = 99.5. In this case, the traveler who chose 99 will get a higher reward than the one who chose 100.\n\nKnowing this, both travelers will try to choose a fare slightly lower than 100 to outsmart the other. However, this logic can be applied iteratively, leading both travelers to choose lower and lower fares. Eventually, they will reach the lowest possible fare, which is 1.\n\nSo, in the Traveler's Dilemma, both travelers should choose a fare of 1 to optimize their reward. This is because, by choosing any higher fare, they risk the other traveler choosing a fare one unit lower, which would result in a lower reward for them."
