    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x,y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 8x - 10y + 25, we can complete the square for both x and y terms.\n\nFirst, let's group the x and y terms:\n\nf(x,y) = (x^2 - 8x) + (2xy) + (y^2 - 10y) + 25\n\nNow, complete the square for the x terms:\n\nx^2 - 8x = (x - 4)^2 - 16\n\nAnd complete the square for the y terms:\n\ny^2 - 10y = (y - 5)^2 - 25\n\nNow, substitute these back into the original function:\n\nf(x,y) = ((x - 4)^2 - 16) + 2xy + ((y - 5)^2 - 25) + 25\n\nSimplify the function:\n\nf(x,y) = (x - 4)^2 + (y - 5)^2 - 16 + 2xy\n\nNow, we can see that the function is a sum of two squares, which are always non-negative:\n\nf(x,y) = (x - 4)^2 + (y - 5)^2 + 2xy - 16\n\nThe minimum value of f(x,y) occurs when both (x - 4)^2 and (y - 5)^2 are minimized, which happens when x = 4 and y = 5. In this case, f(4,5) = 0 + 0 + 2(4)(5) - 16 = 32 - 16 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f(x,y) is 16."
