    "message_1": "A company claims that the mean weight of their cereal boxes is 453 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. A sample of 50 cereal boxes is taken to test the claim. Determine if the sample data supports the company's claim at a 5% significance level.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the sample data supports the company's claim at a 5% significance level, we will perform a hypothesis test using the z-test for the sample mean.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 453 grams (The mean weight of the cereal boxes is 453 grams)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 453 grams (The mean weight of the cereal boxes is not 453 grams)\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance.\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nThe formula for the z-test statistic is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide the sample mean (x̄). Please provide the sample mean to proceed with the calculation."
