    "message_1": "A soft drink company claims that their new product contains on average 10% less sugar than the leading competitors. To test this claim, a sample of 50 cans of the new product was selected and the sugar content was measured. The mean sugar content was found to be 25 grams per can with a standard deviation of 4 grams per can. Can we reject the company's claim at a significance level of 5%?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The company claims that their product contains 10% less sugar than the leading competitors.\n2. The sample size (n) is 50 cans.\n3. The sample mean (x̄) is 25 grams per can.\n4. The sample standard deviation (s) is 4 grams per can.\n5. The significance level (α) is 5% or 0.05.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean sugar content of the leading competitor's product. Let's denote it as μ₀. Since the new product claims to have 10% less sugar, we can write:\n\nx̄ = 0.9 * μ₀\n25 = 0.9 * μ₀\nμ₀ = 25 / 0.9\nμ₀ ≈ 27.78 grams per can\n\nNow, we will perform a one-sample t-test with the null hypothesis (H₀) that the true mean sugar content of the new product is equal to 90% of the leading competitor's product (μ = 0.9 * μ₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁) that the true mean sugar content is not equal to 90% of the leading competitor's product (μ ≠ 0.9 * μ₀).\n\nThe t-statistic is calculated as follows:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ₀) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (25 - 27.78) / (4 / √50)\nt ≈ -3.97\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) equal to n - 1 = 49. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.01.\n\nSince the calculated t-statistic (-3.97) is less than the critical t-value (-2.01), we reject the null hypothesis (H₀) at a significance level of 5%. This means that we have enough evidence to reject the company's claim that their new product contains on average 10% less sugar than the leading competitors."
