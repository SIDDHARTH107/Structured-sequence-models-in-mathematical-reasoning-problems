    "message_2": "Since X has a Morse function f with exactly 3 critical points and the index of each critical point is different, we know that there are critical points with indices 0, 1, and 2. Let's denote the number of critical points of index i as $b_i$. We are given that $b_0 = 1$ and $b_1 = 4$. Since there is only one critical point left, we have $b_2 = 1$.\n\nNow, we want to show that the inequality $b_k \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\mathrm{rank}(H_i(X))$ holds for the homology groups of X. We will check this inequality for each index k.\n\nFor $k=0$, we have $b_0 = 1$. Since $H_0(X)$ counts the number of connected components of X, we have $\\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X)) \\geq 1$. Therefore, the inequality holds for $k=0$.\n\nFor $k=1$, we have $b_1 = 4$. By Morse inequalities, we know that\n$$b_1 - b_0 \\leq \\mathrm{rank}(H_1(X)) - \\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X)).$$\nPlugging in the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$, we get\n$$4 - 1 \\leq \\mathrm{rank}(H_1(X)) - \\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X)).$$\nThis implies that $\\mathrm{rank}(H_1(X)) \\geq 3 + \\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X))$. Since $\\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X)) \\geq 1$, we have $\\mathrm{rank}(H_1(X)) \\geq 4$. Therefore, the inequality holds for $k=1$.\n\nFor $k=2$, we have $b_2 = 1$. By Morse inequalities, we know that\n$$b_2 - b_1 + b_0 \\leq \\mathrm{rank}(H_2(X)) - \\mathrm{rank}(H_1(X)) + \\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X)).$$\nPlugging in the values of $b_0$, $b_1$, and $b_2$, we get\n$$1 - 4 + 1 \\leq \\mathrm{rank}(H_2(X)) - \\mathrm{rank}(H_1(X)) + \\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X)).$$\nThis implies that $\\mathrm{rank}(H_2(X)) \\geq 2 + \\mathrm{rank}(H_1(X)) - \\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X))$. Since $\\mathrm{rank}(H_1(X)) \\geq 4$ and $\\mathrm{rank}(H_0(X)) \\geq 1$, we have $\\mathrm{rank}(H_2(X)) \\geq 1$. Therefore, the inequality holds for $k=2$.\n\nSince the inequality holds for all indices k, we have shown that the homology groups of X satisfy the inequality $b_k \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\mathrm{rank}(H_i(X))$.\n\nNow, we want to calculate the number of connected components of X. Since $b_0 = 1$, there is only one critical point of index 0. This critical point corresponds to a minimum of the Morse function f, which means that X has only one connected component."
