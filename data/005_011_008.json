    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that their tennis balls have a mean bounce height of 81 inches. To test this claim, a sample of 36 tennis balls is selected and measured. The sample has a mean bounce height of 79 inches with a standard deviation of 3.5 inches. Is there enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. We are given the following information:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 81 inches (mean bounce height claimed by the manufacturer)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 81 inches (mean bounce height is different from the claim)\n\nSample size (n) = 36\nSample mean (x̄) = 79 inches\nSample standard deviation (s) = 3.5 inches\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (79 - 81) / (3.5 / √36)\nt = (-2) / (3.5 / 6)\nt = -2 / 0.583\nt ≈ -3.43\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 35 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.03.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.43) is less than the critical t-value (-2.03), we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence at the 0.05 significance level to reject the manufacturer's claim that the mean bounce height of their tennis balls is 81 inches."
