    "message_1": "A factory produces widgets daily. On day 1, there are 100 widgets produced. Each day thereafter, the production level is equal to the previous day's production level multiplied by 1.5. Write a recurrence relation for this situation, and use it to determine how many widgets will be produced on day 5.",
    "message_2": "Let P(n) represent the number of widgets produced on day n. The given information states that the production level each day is 1.5 times the previous day's production level. Therefore, we can write the recurrence relation as:\n\nP(n) = 1.5 * P(n-1)\n\nWe are also given that on day 1, 100 widgets are produced:\n\nP(1) = 100\n\nNow, we can use the recurrence relation to find the number of widgets produced on day 5:\n\nP(2) = 1.5 * P(1) = 1.5 * 100 = 150\nP(3) = 1.5 * P(2) = 1.5 * 150 = 225\nP(4) = 1.5 * P(3) = 1.5 * 225 = 337.5\nP(5) = 1.5 * P(4) = 1.5 * 337.5 = 506.25\n\nTherefore, on day 5, 506.25 widgets will be produced. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a widget, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, the factory will produce approximately 506 widgets on day 5."
