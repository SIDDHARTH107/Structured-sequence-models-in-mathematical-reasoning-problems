    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that the political party will win a vote on a bill, we need to determine the percentage of votes they will have if 80% of their members vote with the party line.\n\nIf the political party holds 40% of the seats in parliament, and 80% of their members vote with the party line, then the percentage of votes they will have is:\n\n0.40 (percentage of seats) * 0.80 (percentage of members voting with the party line) = 0.32 or 32%\n\nSo, the probability that the political party will win a vote on a bill is 32%."
