    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 4, 6}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, then find the symmetric difference between A and B using the Cartesian product. Show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product by comparing (A △ B) x (B △ A) and (B △ A) x (A △ B).",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} - {2} = {1, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences (A △ B) x (B △ A). Since the symmetric difference is commutative (A △ B = B △ A), we only need to compute one of them:\n\n(A △ B) x (B △ A) = {1, 3, 4, 6} x {1, 3, 4, 6} = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences (B △ A) x (A △ B):\n\n(B △ A) x (A △ B) = {1, 3, 4, 6} x {1, 3, 4, 6} = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) x (B △ A) = (B △ A) x (A △ B). Therefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
