    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity. We will do this by plugging in all possible x values in the finite field F7 and checking if the resulting y^2 value has a square root in the field. If it does, we count the corresponding points.\n\nThe equation of the elliptic curve is y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 (mod 7), which simplifies to y^2 = x^3 + x + 3 (mod 7).\n\nNow, we will plug in all possible x values from 0 to 6 and check for square roots:\n\n1. x = 0: y^2 = 0^3 + 0 + 3 (mod 7) = 3 (mod 7)\n   There are no square roots of 3 in F7, so no points for x = 0.\n\n2. x = 1: y^2 = 1^3 + 1 + 3 (mod 7) = 5 (mod 7)\n   The square roots of 5 in F7 are 2 and 5, so we have two points for x = 1: (1, 2) and (1, 5).\n\n3. x = 2: y^2 = 2^3 + 2 + 3 (mod 7) = 15 (mod 7) = 1 (mod 7)\n   The square roots of 1 in F7 are 1 and 6, so we have two points for x = 2: (2, 1) and (2, 6).\n\n4. x = 3: y^2 = 3^3 + 3 + 3 (mod 7) = 33 (mod 7) = 5 (mod 7)\n   The square roots of 5 in F7 are 2 and 5, so we have two points for x = 3: (3, 2) and (3, 5).\n\n5. x = 4: y^2 = 4^3 + 4 + 3 (mod 7) = 71 (mod 7) = 1 (mod 7)\n   The square roots of 1 in F7 are 1 and 6, so we have two points for x = 4: (4, 1) and (4, 6).\n\n6. x = 5: y^2 = 5^3 + 5 + 3 (mod 7) = 133 (mod 7) = 0 (mod 7)\n   The square root of 0 in F7 is 0, so we have one point for x = 5: (5, 0).\n\n7. x = 6: y^2 = 6^3 + 6 + 3 (mod 7) = 225 (mod 7) = 4 (mod 7)\n   The square roots of 4 in F7 are 2 and 5, so we have two points for x = 6: (6, 2) and (6, 5).\n\nNow, we count the points we found: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 11 points. However, we also need to include the point at infinity, so the order of the elliptic curve is 11 + 1 = 12."
