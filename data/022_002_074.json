    "message_2": "To find the image of the unit disk under the conformal mapping $f(z) = \\frac{2z-1}{z+1}$, we will first find the images of some key points and then determine the general shape of the image.\n\n1. Image of the center of the unit disk:\nThe center of the unit disk is $z = 0$. Applying the mapping $f(z)$, we get:\n$f(0) = \\frac{2(0) - 1}{0 + 1} = -1$\n\n2. Image of the boundary of the unit disk:\nThe boundary of the unit disk is given by $|z| = 1$. Let $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. Then,\n$f(e^{i\\theta}) = \\frac{2e^{i\\theta} - 1}{e^{i\\theta} + 1}$\nNow, let $w = f(e^{i\\theta})$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get:\n$w = \\frac{(2e^{i\\theta} - 1)(e^{-i\\theta} - 1)}{(e^{i\\theta} + 1)(e^{-i\\theta} - 1)}$\n$w = \\frac{2e^{i\\theta}e^{-i\\theta} - 2e^{i\\theta} - e^{-i\\theta} + 1}{e^{i\\theta}e^{-i\\theta} - 1}$\n$w = \\frac{2 - 2e^{i\\theta} - e^{-i\\theta} + 1}{1 - 1}$\n$w = \\frac{3 - 2e^{i\\theta} - e^{-i\\theta}}{0}$\nSince the denominator is zero, the image of the boundary points is at infinity. This means that the image of the boundary of the unit disk is a straight line.\n\n3. Image of the interior of the unit disk:\nSince the mapping is conformal, the image of the interior of the unit disk will be the region enclosed by the straight line found in step 2.\n\nPutting all this information together, we can conclude that the image of the unit disk under the conformal mapping $f(z) = \\frac{2z-1}{z+1}$ is the right half-plane $\\{w \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\operatorname{Re}(w) > -1\\}$."
