    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of the vector field $X$ with respect to the vector field $Y$, we use the Lie bracket of the two vector fields, which is defined as $[Y, X] = YX - XY$. \n\nFirst, we compute the action of $Y$ on $X$:\n$$\nYX = Y(y\\partial_x + x\\partial_y) = Y(y\\partial_x) + Y(x\\partial_y).\n$$\n\nNow, we apply the product rule for vector fields:\n$$\nY(y\\partial_x) = (Yy)\\partial_x + y(Y\\partial_x) = (\\partial_x y)\\partial_x = \\partial_x(y\\partial_x),\n$$\nand\n$$\nY(x\\partial_y) = (Yx)\\partial_y + x(Y\\partial_y) = (\\partial_x x)\\partial_y = \\partial_x(x\\partial_y).\n$$\n\nSo, we have\n$$\nYX = \\partial_x(y\\partial_x) + \\partial_x(x\\partial_y).\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the action of $X$ on $Y$:\n$$\nXY = X(\\partial_x) = y\\partial_x(\\partial_x) + x\\partial_y(\\partial_x).\n$$\n\nSince $\\partial_x$ and $\\partial_y$ are partial derivatives, we have\n$$\n\\partial_x(\\partial_x) = \\partial_x^2,\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\partial_y(\\partial_x) = 0.\n$$\n\nThus,\n$$\nXY = y\\partial_x^2.\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the Lie bracket $[Y, X] = YX - XY$:\n$$\n[Y, X] = \\partial_x(y\\partial_x) + \\partial_x(x\\partial_y) - y\\partial_x^2.\n$$\n\nFinally, we can rewrite the Lie derivative in terms of the original vector fields:\n$$\n[Y, X] = (\\partial_x y - y)\\partial_x + x\\partial_x(\\partial_y) = (\\partial_x y - y)\\partial_x + x\\partial_{xy}.\n$$\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to $Y$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_Y X = (\\partial_x y - y)\\partial_x + x\\partial_{xy}.\n$$"
