    "message_1": "In a community of 500 families, the probability of a family owning a dog is 0.6 and the probability of a family owning a cat is 0.4. What is the probability that a family chosen at random owns both a dog and a cat?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a family owning both a dog and a cat, we need to know if owning a dog and owning a cat are independent events. If they are independent, we can simply multiply the probabilities together. However, without this information, we cannot determine the exact probability of a family owning both a dog and a cat."
