    "message_2": "To determine the next two numbers in the sequence, we can first look for a pattern. Let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n5 - 2 = 3\n10 - 5 = 5\n17 - 10 = 7\n26 - 17 = 9\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 2 each time (3, 5, 7, 9). So, we can infer that the next difference should be 11, and the one after that should be 13.\n\nNow, we can add these differences to the last known term in the sequence (26):\n\n26 + 11 = 37\n37 + 13 = 50\n\nSo, the next two numbers in the sequence are 37 and 50. The sequence becomes:\n\n2, 5, 10, 17, 26, 37, 50"
