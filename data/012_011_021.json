    "message_2": "In the given graph, a cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components.\n\nCut vertices: Vertex 2 is a cut vertex. If we remove vertex 2, the graph will be split into three connected components: {1, 3}, {4}, and {5}.\n\nBridges: The edge connecting vertices 2 and 4 (2---4) is a bridge. If we remove this edge, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3, 5} and {4}."
