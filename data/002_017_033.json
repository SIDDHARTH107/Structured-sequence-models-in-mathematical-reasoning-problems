    "message_1": "A regular polygon has a side length of 8 cm and the measure of each of its interior angles is 150 degrees. What is the area of the polygon?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the regular polygon, we first need to determine the number of sides it has. We can do this by using the formula for the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon:\n\nInterior angle = (n - 2) * 180° / n\n\nWhere n is the number of sides. In this case, the interior angle is 150°. So we have:\n\n150 = (n - 2) * 180 / n\n\nMultiplying both sides by n, we get:\n\n150n = 180n - 360\n\nSubtracting 150n from both sides:\n\n30n = 360\n\nDividing by 30:\n\nn = 12\n\nSo the polygon has 12 sides. Now we can find the area of the polygon using the formula:\n\nArea = (n * s²) / (4 * tan(180° / n))\n\nWhere n is the number of sides, s is the side length, and tan is the tangent function. Plugging in the values:\n\nArea = (12 * 8²) / (4 * tan(180° / 12))\n\nArea = (12 * 64) / (4 * tan(15°))\n\nArea ≈ (768) / (4 * 0.2679)\n\nArea ≈ 768 / 1.0716\n\nArea ≈ 716.86 cm²\n\nThe area of the polygon is approximately 716.86 cm²."
