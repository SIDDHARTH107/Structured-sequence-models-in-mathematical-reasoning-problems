    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the first two equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 2, and then add the two equations together:\n\n(1)(x + 2y - 3z) = (1)(0)\n(2)(2x - y + 4z) = (2)(0)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 0\n4x - 2y + 8z = 0\n\nNow, add the two equations together:\n\nx + 4x + 2y - 2y - 3z + 8z = 0 + 0\n5x + 5z = 0\n\nNow, let's eliminate y from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 1 and the third equation by 1, and then add the two equations together:\n\n(1)(2x - y + 4z) = (1)(0)\n(1)(3x + y - 7z) = (1)(0)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n2x - y + 4z = 0\n3x + y - 7z = 0\n\nNow, add the two equations together:\n\n2x + 3x - y + y + 4z - 7z = 0 + 0\n5x - 3z = 0\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\n5x + 5z = 0\n5x - 3z = 0\n\nWe can subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n5x + 5z - (5x - 3z) = 0 - 0\n5x + 5z - 5x + 3z = 0\n8z = 0\n\nNow, divide by 8:\n\nz = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find the value of x. Let's use the equation 5x + 5z = 0:\n\n5x + 5(0) = 0\n5x = 0\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\nx = 0\n\nNow that we have the values of x and z, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the equation x + 2y - 3z = 0:\n\n0 + 2y - 3(0) = 0\n2y = 0\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\ny = 0\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of linear equations are x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
