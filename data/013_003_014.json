    "message_1": "A seller has a cake and wants to sell it to a buyer. The seller first suggests a price for the cake, and the buyer can either accept or reject the offer. If the buyer accepts, they both receive a certain monetary payoff, but if the buyer rejects, both parties receive nothing. The game ends after one round. Suppose the seller suggests a price of $20. How much payoff should the seller offer to the buyer to ensure that they will accept the offer in the ultimatum game?",
    "message_2": "In the ultimatum game, the seller wants to maximize their payoff while ensuring that the buyer accepts the offer. The buyer will accept the offer as long as they receive a non-zero payoff, since receiving something is better than nothing.\n\nTo ensure that the buyer accepts the offer, the seller should offer the smallest non-zero amount to the buyer. In this case, the seller could offer $0.01 to the buyer and keep $19.99 for themselves. This way, the buyer receives a non-zero payoff and is likely to accept the offer, while the seller maximizes their own payoff."
