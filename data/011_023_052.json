    "message_1": "Consider a graph G, where G has 6 vertices, and each vertex has degree 3. What is the minimum number of colors needed to properly color each vertex of G if no two adjacent vertices can have the same color?",
    "message_2": "A graph with 6 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3 is a regular graph. In this case, it is a 3-regular graph. According to the theorem, the chromatic number of a regular graph is either its degree or its degree plus one.\n\nTo determine the minimum number of colors needed, we can try to color the graph using 3 colors first. If it's not possible, then we'll need to use 4 colors.\n\nHowever, a 3-regular graph with 6 vertices is not possible because the Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees would be 6 * 3 = 18, which means there should be 9 edges. But, a complete graph with 6 vertices (K6) has 15 edges, and a 3-regular graph with 6 vertices would require a subgraph of K6, which is not possible.\n\nSo, the given problem is not valid, as a 3-regular graph with 6 vertices cannot exist."
