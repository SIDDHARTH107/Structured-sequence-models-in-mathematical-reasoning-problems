    "message_2": "To find the values of x that make y equal to 2, we can set y = 2 in the given quadratic equation:\n\n2 = x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for x. First, we can subtract 2 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -4, and c = 1. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nPlugging in the values of a, b, and c:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(1))) / 2(1)\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 4)) / 2\nx = (4 ± √12) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root of 12:\n\n√12 = √(4 * 3) = 2√3\n\nSo, the two possible values of x are:\n\nx = (4 + 2√3) / 2 = 2 + √3\nx = (4 - 2√3) / 2 = 2 - √3\n\nThus, the values of x that make y equal to 2 are x = 2 + √3 and x = 2 - √3."
