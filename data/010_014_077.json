    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group of the space X, we will use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. We will cover X with two open sets U and V, where U is the square with a small open neighborhood around the diagonal removed, and V is an open neighborhood of the diagonal. The intersection U ∩ V is homotopy equivalent to the disjoint union of two open intervals.\n\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence for cohomology with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is given by:\n\n$$\\cdots \\rightarrow H^0(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H^0(U;\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H^0(V;\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H^0(U \\cap V;\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H^1(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H^1(U;\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H^1(V;\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow \\cdots$$\n\nSince U is homotopy equivalent to the square with the diagonal removed, it has the same cohomology groups as the square, which are $H^0(U;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H^1(U;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. V is contractible, so its cohomology groups are $H^0(V;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H^1(V;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. The intersection U ∩ V has the cohomology groups $H^0(U \\cap V;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H^1(U \\cap V;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nThe relevant portion of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is now:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow H^1(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow 0$$\n\nThis implies that $H^1(X;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$."
