    "message_1": "A school has 120 students in total. Out of these 120 students, 60 students are girls and 40 students are enrolled in a mathematics course. Among the mathematics students, there are 25 girls. Find the probability that a randomly selected student from the school is a mathematics student who is a boy.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the number of boys who are enrolled in the mathematics course. Since there are 25 girls in the mathematics course and a total of 40 students enrolled in the course, there must be 15 boys in the mathematics course (40 - 25 = 15).\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that a randomly selected student is a mathematics student who is a boy. To do this, we will divide the number of boys in the mathematics course by the total number of students in the school.\n\nProbability = (Number of boys in the mathematics course) / (Total number of students)\nProbability = 15 / 120\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15.\n\nProbability = (15 รท 15) / (120 รท 15)\nProbability = 1 / 8\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from the school is a mathematics student who is a boy is 1/8 or 0.125."
