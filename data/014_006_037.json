The student has a pre-shared random key that is also 10 binary digits long. What is the encrypted message that the student should send if the original message is \"0110101100\" and the key is \"1011011000\"?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using one-time pad encryption, the student needs to perform a bitwise XOR operation between the original message and the key. \n\nOriginal message: 0110101100\nKey:             1011011000\n\nPerforming XOR operation:\n\n0 XOR 1 = 1\n1 XOR 0 = 1\n1 XOR 1 = 0\n0 XOR 1 = 1\n1 XOR 0 = 1\n0 XOR 1 = 1\n1 XOR 1 = 0\n1 XOR 0 = 1\n0 XOR 0 = 0\n0 XOR 0 = 0\n\nEncrypted message: 1101101010"
