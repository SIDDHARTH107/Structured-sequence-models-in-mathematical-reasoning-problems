    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(4,4) is the smallest integer N such that any graph of order N (i.e., having N vertices) will contain either a clique of size 4 (a complete subgraph with 4 vertices, all connected to each other) or an independent set of size 4 (a set of 4 vertices with no edges between them). In other words, it is the smallest number of vertices needed to guarantee that either a complete subgraph of size 4 or an independent set of size 4 will be present in the graph.\n\nThe Ramsey number R(4,4) is known to be 18. This means that in any graph with 18 or more vertices, there must be either a clique of size 4 or an independent set of size 4."
