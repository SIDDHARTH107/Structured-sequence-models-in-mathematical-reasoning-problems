    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 12 guests and 4 tables, each seating 3 guests. We need to make sure that each guest sits with every other guest at least once.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of ways to divide the 12 guests into 4 groups of 3. This can be done using the multinomial coefficient formula:\n\nC(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nIn our case, n = 12, and n1 = n2 = n3 = n4 = 3. So the number of ways to divide the guests into 4 groups of 3 is:\n\nC(12; 3, 3, 3, 3) = 12! / (3! * 3! * 3! * 3!) = 369600 / 1296 = 285\n\nNow, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange these groups of 3 guests at the 4 tables. Since there are 4 tables, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the groups at the tables.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the number of seating charts, because the order of the guests within each group does not matter. For each group of 3 guests, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them. So we need to divide our result by 6^4 (since there are 4 groups of 3 guests).\n\nTherefore, the total number of different seating charts is:\n\n(285 * 24) / (6^4) = 6840 / 1296 = 5\n\nSo there are 5 different seating charts possible that satisfy the given conditions."
