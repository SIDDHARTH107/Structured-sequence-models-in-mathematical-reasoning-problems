    "message_1": "A store offers 8 different flavors of ice cream. If a customer wants to buy 5 scoops of ice cream, in how many different ways can they select the scoops if they want at least one scoop of each flavor? (Hint: use multinomial coefficients)",
    "message_2": "Since the customer wants at least one scoop of each flavor, it is not possible to select 5 scoops of ice cream from 8 different flavors. The minimum number of scoops required to have at least one scoop of each flavor is 8 scoops. Therefore, there are 0 ways to select 5 scoops of ice cream with at least one scoop of each flavor."
