    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations on the augmented matrix to get it into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n```\n| 1  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 2 -1  3 | -1 |\n| 3  1  2 |  3 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row to eliminate the x coefficients in the second and third rows:\n\n```\n| 1  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -11|\n| 0 -5  5 | -12|\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -5:\n\n```\n| 1  2 -1 |  5  |\n| 0  1 -1 |  2.2|\n| 0 -5  5 | -12 |\n```\n\nStep 3: Add 5 times the second row to the third row, and subtract 2 times the second row from the first row to eliminate the y coefficients in the first and third rows:\n\n```\n| 1  0  3 |  0.6|\n| 0  1 -1 |  2.2|\n| 0  0  0 |  1  |\n```\n\nSince the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 1, which is not possible, the given system of linear equations has no solution."
