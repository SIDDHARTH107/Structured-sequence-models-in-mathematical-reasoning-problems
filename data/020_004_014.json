    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of computer chips A and B. The company earns a profit of $12 for each type A chip and $18 for each type B chip. The production of type A chip requires 1 hour of assembly time and 2 hours of testing time. The production of type B chip requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of testing time. The company has 7 hours of assembly time and 9 hours of testing time available per day. What is the maximum possible profit that the company can earn in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A chips and y be the number of type B chips produced in a day.\n\nThe profit function is P(x, y) = 12x + 18y.\n\nThe constraints for the assembly and testing times are:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 7 (assembly time)\n2x + 1y ≤ 9 (testing time)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 1x + 2y = 7\ny = (7 - x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 1y = 9\ny = 9 - 2x\n\nThe intersection points of these lines are:\n\n(0, 0) - origin\n(0, 3.5) - intersection of 1x + 2y = 7 with y-axis\n(4.5, 0) - intersection of 2x + 1y = 9 with x-axis\n(3, 2) - intersection of 1x + 2y = 7 and 2x + 1y = 9\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these intersection points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 12(0) + 18(0) = $0\nP(0, 3.5) = 12(0) + 18(3.5) = $63\nP(4.5, 0) = 12(4.5) + 18(0) = $54\nP(3, 2) = 12(3) + 18(2) = $72\n\nThe maximum possible profit is $72, which occurs when the company produces 3 type A chips and 2 type B chips in a day."
