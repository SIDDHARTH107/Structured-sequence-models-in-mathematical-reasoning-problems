    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to find the number of ways to partition 20 identical balls into 4 non-empty boxes. So, we need to find the value of S(20, 4).\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind formula:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can find the value of S(20, 4) by calculating the Stirling numbers for smaller values of n and k and using the results to build up to the desired value.\n\nHere's a table of Stirling numbers for n = 1 to 20 and k = 1 to 4:\n\nn\\k | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4\n----|---------|---------|---------|---------\n1   | 1       | 0       | 0       | 0\n2   | 1       | 1       | 0       | 0\n3   | 1       | 3       | 1       | 0\n4   | 1       | 7       | 6       | 1\n5   | 1       | 15      | 25      | 10\n6   | 1       | 31      | 90      | 65\n7   | 1       | 63      | 301     | 350\n8   | 1       | 127     | 966     | 1701\n9   | 1       | 255     | 3025    | 7770\n10  | 1       | 511     | 9330    | 34105\n11  | 1       | 1023    | 28501   | 130750\n12  | 1       | 2047    | 86526   | 463800\n13  | 1       | 4095    | 261625  | 2042975\n14  | 1       | 8191    | 982800  | 10400600\n15  | 1       | 16383   | 3646500 | 45379620\n16  | 1       | 32767   | 10843546| 176726319\n17  | 1       | 65535   | 31594600| 656412042\n18  | 1       | 131071  | 86493225| 2713190410\n19  | 1       | 262143  | 212837625| 10850511170\n20  | 1       | 524287  | 471533587| 50827132350\n\nFrom the table, we can see that S(20, 4) = 50,827,132,350. Therefore, there are 50,827,132,350 ways to arrange 20 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes such that no box is empty."
