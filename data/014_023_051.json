    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Rail fence cipher with a rail key of 3, we write the message in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nM   E   A   S\n A H A T I T\n  T   M   C\n\nNow, we read the message from left to right, top to bottom:\n\nMEASAHATITTMC\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"MEASAHATITTMC\".\n\nTo decrypt the message, we reverse the process. We know the rail key is 3, so we create a zigzag pattern with 3 rows and place the characters of the encrypted message accordingly:\n\nM   E   A   S\n ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n  ?   ?   ? \n\n A H A T I T\n  T   M   C\n\nNow, we fill in the missing characters by reading the zigzag pattern diagonally:\n\nM   E   A   S\n A H A T I T\n  T   M   C\n\nThe decrypted message is \"MATHEMATICS\"."
