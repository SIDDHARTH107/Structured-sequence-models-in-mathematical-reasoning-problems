    "message_1": "Assuming there are 100 fishes in a lake shared by 10 fishermen and each fisherman has a quota of 10 fishes, what is the maximum number of fish that can be sustainably harvested by all the fishermen without depleting the fish population in the lake?",
    "message_2": "To sustainably harvest fish without depleting the fish population, the fishermen need to ensure that the fish population can reproduce and maintain its current size. In this case, the maximum number of fish that can be sustainably harvested depends on the reproduction rate of the fish and the rate at which the fish population can replenish itself.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we cannot determine the reproduction rate or the replenishment rate of the fish population. Therefore, we cannot determine the maximum number of fish that can be sustainably harvested without depleting the fish population in the lake."
