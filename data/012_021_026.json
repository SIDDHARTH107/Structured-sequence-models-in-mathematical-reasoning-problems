The width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest set of vertices in any bag minus one.",
    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition with the minimum width. One possible tree decomposition is:\n\n```\n  {A, B, C}\n /       \\\n{B, D, E} {C, E, F}\n |         |\n{B, D}   {C, F}\n |         |\n{B, E}   {E, F}\n   \\     /\n    {E, G}\n```\n\nIn this tree decomposition, the largest set of vertices in any bag is {A, B, C}, which has a size of 3. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
