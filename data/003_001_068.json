    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall at an angle of 60 degrees. If the ladder is 10 meters long, how far is the bottom of the ladder from the wall?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, we can use trigonometry. Specifically, we can use the cosine function. The cosine function relates the angle, the adjacent side (the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall), and the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder).\n\ncos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees and the hypotenuse is 10 meters. We want to find the adjacent side, which is the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall.\n\ncos(60) = adjacent side / 10\n\ncos(60) = 0.5 (since cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5)\n\n0.5 = adjacent side / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the adjacent side:\n\nadjacent side = 0.5 * 10\nadjacent side = 5 meters\n\nSo, the bottom of the ladder is 5 meters away from the wall."
