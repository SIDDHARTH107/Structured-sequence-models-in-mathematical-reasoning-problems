    "message_1": "A school has 500 students, out of which 75% are expected to pass their math exam. What is the probability that at least 350 students would pass their exams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (students passing the exam) out of n trials (total students)\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (n! / (x! * (n-x)!))\n- p is the probability of success (passing the exam) for a single trial (student)\n- n is the total number of trials (students)\n- x is the number of successes (students passing the exam)\n\nIn this problem:\n- n = 500 (total students)\n- p = 0.75 (75% probability of passing the exam)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 350 students pass their exams, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for x = 350, 351, ..., 500.\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the event not occurring is that fewer than 350 students pass their exams. So, we can find the sum of probabilities for x = 0, 1, ..., 349 and subtract it from 1.\n\nLet's denote the probability of at least 350 students passing their exams as P(X ≥ 350). Then, we have:\n\nP(X ≥ 350) = 1 - P(X < 350) = 1 - Σ[P(x) for x = 0 to 349]\n\nCalculating the sum of probabilities for x = 0 to 349 can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability.\n\nThe normal approximation uses the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution, which are given by:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nμ = 500 * 0.75 = 375\nσ = sqrt(500 * 0.75 * 0.25) ≈ 9.57\n\nNow, we can standardize the normal distribution by finding the z-score for x = 349.5 (using the continuity correction):\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ = (349.5 - 375) / 9.57 ≈ -2.66\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability for z = -2.66:\n\nP(Z ≤ -2.66) ≈ 0.0038\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 350 students passing their exams:\n\nP(X ≥ 350) = 1 - P(X < 350) ≈ 1 - 0.0038 = 0.9962\n\nSo, the probability that at least 350 students would pass their exams is approximately 99.62%."
