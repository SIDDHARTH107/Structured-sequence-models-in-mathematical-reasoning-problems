    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset containing the ages of 100 students in a mathematics class. The mean age of students is 20 years, with a standard deviation of 2.5 years. If a new student is added to the class who is 23 years old, what is the z-score of the new student's age in relation to the rest of the class?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the z-score of the new student's age, we will use the following formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere z is the z-score, X is the value (in this case, the new student's age), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nGiven the mean age (μ) is 20 years and the standard deviation (σ) is 2.5 years, we can plug in the values:\n\nz = (23 - 20) / 2.5\nz = 3 / 2.5\nz = 1.2\n\nThe z-score of the new student's age is 1.2, which means the new student's age is 1.2 standard deviations above the mean age of the class."
