    "message_1": "Suppose a company is manufacturing electronic devices that have a certain number of components. Each component has a tolerance level, and the tolerance level of a component affects the overall performance of the device. The company wants to ensure that the overall performance of the device is not affected too much due to the variation in the component tolerance levels.\n\nThe company can choose from multiple suppliers for each component, and each supplier offers components with different tolerance levels. The cost of components from each supplier is also different.\n\nThe task is to minimize the cost of the components while ensuring that the overall performance of the device is within an acceptable range, even if there is variation in the tolerance levels of the components. The student should formulate a robust optimization problem for this scenario and provide the optimal component selection strategy with their respective quantities and suppliers in order to minimize the cost. \n\nAs a numerical example, suppose the company needs 10 components for the device and has the following options:\n\n- Supplier 1 offers components with a tolerance level of 5 for $10 each.\n- Supplier 2 offers components with a tolerance level of 10 for $7 each.\n- Supplier 3 offers components with a tolerance level of 15 for $5 each.\n\nThe acceptable range for the overall performance of the device is between 80 and 100. The student should find the optimal component selection strategy to minimize the cost while ensuring that the overall performance of the device is within the acceptable range.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x1, x2, and x3 be the number of components purchased from Supplier 1, Supplier 2, and Supplier 3, respectively. We want to minimize the total cost, which can be represented as:\n\nCost = 10x1 + 7x2 + 5x3\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. The total number of components must be 10: x1 + x2 + x3 = 10\n2. The overall performance of the device must be within the acceptable range (80 to 100): 5x1 + 10x2 + 15x3 >= 80 and 5x1 + 10x2 + 15x3 <= 100\n3. The number of components from each supplier must be non-negative: x1, x2, x3 >= 0\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using any optimization software or solver. The optimal solution is:\n\nx1 = 4, x2 = 6, x3 = 0\n\nThis means that the company should purchase 4 components from Supplier 1 and 6 components from Supplier 2. The total cost for this optimal component selection strategy is:\n\nCost = 10(4) + 7(6) = 40 + 42 = $82\n\nThis solution ensures that the overall performance of the device is within the acceptable range (80 to 100) and minimizes the cost of the components."
