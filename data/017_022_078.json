    "message_2": "There are two non-abelian groups of order 60, up to isomorphism. These groups are:\n\n1. The symmetric group S_5, which is the group of all permutations of 5 elements. It has order 60 because there are 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 elements in total, and S_5 is non-abelian.\n\n2. The alternating group A_5, which is the group of all even permutations of 5 elements. It has order 60 because there are 5!/2 = 60 even permutations, and A_5 is non-abelian.\n\nThese two groups are not isomorphic to each other, as S_5 contains both even and odd permutations, while A_5 contains only even permutations."
