    "message_1": "A local bakery sells $5$ different types of bread. The cost per pound for each type of bread is as follows: \n- Whole Wheat: $3$ dollars \n- Sourdough: $3.5$ dollars \n- Rye: $4$ dollars \n- Italian: $4.25$ dollars \n- French: $4.5$ dollars \n\nThe bakery has $200$ pounds of flour and $46$ pounds of yeast in stock. Each bread type requires a specific amount of flour and yeast per pound of bread: \n\n- Whole Wheat: $0.5$ pounds of flour and $0.01$ pounds of yeast \n- Sourdough: $0.6$ pounds of flour and $0.02$ pounds of yeast \n- Rye: $0.7$ pounds of flour and $0.03$ pounds of yeast \n- Italian: $0.8$ pounds of flour and $0.04$ pounds of yeast \n- French: $0.9$ pounds of flour and $0.05$ pounds of yeast \n\nThe bakery wants to maximize their profit by selling the bread at the highest possible price. How much of each type of bread should they make to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, the bakery should focus on producing the bread with the highest profit margin, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost of production per pound. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of production per pound for each type of bread:\n\nWhole Wheat: (0.5 * flour_cost) + (0.01 * yeast_cost)\nSourdough: (0.6 * flour_cost) + (0.02 * yeast_cost)\nRye: (0.7 * flour_cost) + (0.03 * yeast_cost)\nItalian: (0.8 * flour_cost) + (0.04 * yeast_cost)\nFrench: (0.9 * flour_cost) + (0.05 * yeast_cost)\n\nWe need to find the cost of flour and yeast per pound. We can do this by dividing the total cost of flour and yeast by the total pounds available.\n\nLet's assume the cost of flour is $x$ dollars per pound and the cost of yeast is $y$ dollars per pound. Then, we have:\n\n200 * x = total_cost_of_flour\n46 * y = total_cost_of_yeast\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit margin for each type of bread:\n\nWhole Wheat: $3 - [(0.5 * x) + (0.01 * y)]$\nSourdough: $3.5 - [(0.6 * x) + (0.02 * y)]$\nRye: $4 - [(0.7 * x) + (0.03 * y)]$\nItalian: $4.25 - [(0.8 * x) + (0.04 * y)]$\nFrench: $4.5 - [(0.9 * x) + (0.05 * y)]$\n\nThe bakery should produce the type of bread with the highest profit margin. However, we need more information about the cost of flour and yeast per pound to determine which bread has the highest profit margin. Once we have that information, we can calculate the profit margins and decide which bread to produce.\n\nAfter determining the bread with the highest profit margin, the bakery should produce as much of that bread as possible, given the constraints of the available flour and yeast."
