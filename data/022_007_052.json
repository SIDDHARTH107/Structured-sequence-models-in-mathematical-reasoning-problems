    "message_1": "Let P(x) be a polynomial of degree n with complex coefficients such that |P(z)| ≤ M for all z in C, where M is a positive constant. Find the value of n for which P(x) must be a constant polynomial.",
    "message_2": "By Liouville's theorem, a bounded entire function (i.e., a function that is holomorphic on the entire complex plane and is bounded) must be constant. Since P(x) is a polynomial, it is an entire function. Given that |P(z)| ≤ M for all z in C, P(x) is also bounded.\n\nTherefore, by Liouville's theorem, P(x) must be a constant polynomial. This implies that the degree of P(x) is n = 0."
