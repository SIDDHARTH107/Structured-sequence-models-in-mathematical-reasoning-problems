What is the total curve length of the Gosper curve after six iterations?",
    "message_2": "To find the total curve length of the Gosper curve after six iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal curve length = Initial curve length * (scaling factor) ^ number of iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial curve length is 1 unit, the scaling factor is 7/4, and the number of iterations is 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nTotal curve length = 1 * (7/4)^6\n\nNow, we need to compute (7/4)^6:\n\n(7/4)^6 = 7^6 / 4^6 = 117649 / 4096\n\nSo, the total curve length of the Gosper curve after six iterations is:\n\nTotal curve length = 117649 / 4096 â‰ˆ 28.7402 units"
