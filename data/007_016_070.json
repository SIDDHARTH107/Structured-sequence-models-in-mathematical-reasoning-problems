    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. A safe prime is a prime number of the form 2p + 1, where p is also prime. We are looking for the smallest prime number that satisfies both conditions.\n\nLet's start by listing the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, ...\n\nNow, let's check if they are Sophie Germain primes:\n- For p = 2, 2p + 1 = 5, which is prime. So, 2 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n- For p = 3, 2p + 1 = 7, which is prime. So, 3 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n- For p = 5, 2p + 1 = 11, which is prime. So, 5 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n- For p = 7, 2p + 1 = 15, which is not prime. So, 7 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n- For p = 11, 2p + 1 = 23, which is prime. So, 11 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nNow let's check if these Sophie Germain primes are also safe primes:\n- For p = 2, 2p + 1 = 5, which is prime. So, 2 is a safe prime.\n- For p = 3, 2p + 1 = 7, which is prime. So, 3 is a safe prime.\n- For p = 5, 2p + 1 = 11, which is prime. So, 5 is a safe prime.\n\nTherefore, the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a safe prime is 5."
