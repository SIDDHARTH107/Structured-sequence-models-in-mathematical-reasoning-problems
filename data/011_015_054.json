What is the minimum number of pairs of people that must know each other to guarantee there is a group of 3 people who all know each other, or a group of 3 people where no two of them know each other?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. Consider one person at the party, say person A. There are 5 other people at the party, so person A either knows at least 3 of them or doesn't know at least 3 of them.\n\nCase 1: Person A knows at least 3 people.\nIf any of the 3 people that person A knows also know each other, then we have a group of 3 people who all know each other (including person A). If none of the 3 people know each other, then we have a group of 3 people where no two of them know each other.\n\nCase 2: Person A doesn't know at least 3 people.\nIf any of the 3 people that person A doesn't know also don't know each other, then we have a group of 3 people where no two of them know each other (including person A). If all of the 3 people know each other, then we have a group of 3 people who all know each other.\n\nIn either case, we are guaranteed to have a group of 3 people who all know each other or a group of 3 people where no two of them know each other. Since there are 5 pairs of people involving person A, the minimum number of pairs of people that must know each other to guarantee this condition is 3."
