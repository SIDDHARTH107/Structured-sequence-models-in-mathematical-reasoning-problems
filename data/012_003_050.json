    "message_2": "To determine the size of the maximum independent set of vertices in G, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of the maximum independent set and the minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices in the graph. This is known as the Gallai's theorem.\n\nFirst, let's find an upper bound for the minimum vertex cover. By Tur√°n's theorem, a graph with n vertices and more than (n-1)(n-2)/2 edges must contain a triangle. In our case, n = 7, so if a graph has more than (7-1)(7-2)/2 = 15 edges, it must contain a triangle. Since our graph has 9 edges, it is possible that it does not contain a triangle.\n\nHowever, we can still find an upper bound for the minimum vertex cover. In a graph without a triangle, the minimum vertex cover can be at most n/2, where n is the number of vertices. This is because, in the worst case, we would need to cover each edge with a distinct vertex. In our case, n = 7, so the upper bound for the minimum vertex cover is 7/2 = 3.5. Since the vertex cover must be an integer, we can round up to get an upper bound of 4.\n\nNow, we can use Gallai's theorem to find the size of the maximum independent set. Since the sum of the size of the maximum independent set and the minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices, we have:\n\nsize of maximum independent set + size of minimum vertex cover = 7\n\nSince we found an upper bound of 4 for the minimum vertex cover, we can conclude that the size of the maximum independent set is at least 7 - 4 = 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the size of the maximum independent set of vertices in G is at least 3."
