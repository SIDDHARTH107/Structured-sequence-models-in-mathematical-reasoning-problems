    "message_1": "A boat is moving with a velocity of 20 m/s at an angle of 30 degrees North of East. Determine the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the East.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the East, we can use vector components. We can break down the boat's velocity into its horizontal (East) and vertical (North) components.\n\nThe horizontal component (Vx) can be found using the cosine function:\nVx = V * cos(θ)\nVx = 20 m/s * cos(30°)\nVx ≈ 17.32 m/s (East)\n\nThe vertical component (Vy) can be found using the sine function:\nVy = V * sin(θ)\nVy = 20 m/s * sin(30°)\nVy ≈ 10 m/s (North)\n\nSo, the boat's velocity relative to the East is approximately 17.32 m/s, and the direction is 30 degrees North of East."
