    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element in A. The empty set, denoted as ∅, has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A. \n\nBy definition, a set B is a subset of a set A (written as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. Since there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A, we can conclude that the empty set is a subset of A.\n\n∅ ⊆ A"
