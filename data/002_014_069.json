    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 of each type (length x width, length x height, and width x height).\n\n1. Length x Width: 6 cm x 4 cm = 24 cm²\nSince there are 2 faces of this type, the total area for these faces is 2 x 24 cm² = 48 cm².\n\n2. Length x Height: 6 cm x 5 cm = 30 cm²\nSince there are 2 faces of this type, the total area for these faces is 2 x 30 cm² = 60 cm².\n\n3. Width x Height: 4 cm x 5 cm = 20 cm²\nSince there are 2 faces of this type, the total area for these faces is 2 x 20 cm² = 40 cm².\n\nNow, add the areas of all the faces together:\n48 cm² + 60 cm² + 40 cm² = 148 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 cm²."
