    "message_2": "To find the derivative of 洧녭(洧논) = (洧논^2 - 5)(3洧논^3 + 2) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together: u(洧논) = 洧논^2 - 5 and v(洧논) = 3洧논^3 + 2.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\n(洧녹洧녺)' = 洧녹'洧녺 + 洧녹洧녺'\n\nNow, we find the derivatives of u(洧논) and v(洧논):\n\nu'(洧논) = d(洧논^2 - 5)/d洧논 = 2洧논\nv'(洧논) = d(3洧논^3 + 2)/d洧논 = 9洧논^2\n\nApplying the product rule, we get:\n\n洧녭'(洧논) = (2洧논)(3洧논^3 + 2) + (洧논^2 - 5)(9洧논^2)\n\nNow, we find the derivative of 洧녭(洧논) at 洧논 = 1:\n\n洧녭'(1) = (2)(3(1)^3 + 2) + ((1)^2 - 5)(9(1)^2)\n洧녭'(1) = (2)(3 + 2) + (1 - 5)(9)\n洧녭'(1) = (2)(5) - (4)(9)\n洧녭'(1) = 10 - 36\n洧녭'(1) = -26\n\nSo, the derivative of 洧녭(洧논) at 洧논 = 1 is -26."
