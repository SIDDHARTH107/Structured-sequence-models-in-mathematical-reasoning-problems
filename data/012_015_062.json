    "message_2": "To determine whether there exist two vertices in this graph that are not connected by a path, we can use the concept of connected components. A connected component is a subgraph in which every two vertices are connected to each other by a path, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph would be a tree, which is a connected graph with the minimum number of edges. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. In our case, with 8 vertices, a tree would have 7 edges.\n\nHowever, our graph has 12 edges, which is more than the minimum number of edges required for a connected graph with 8 vertices. Therefore, there must be at least one cycle in the graph. Since the graph has a cycle, it must be connected, meaning that there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n\nSo, there do not exist two vertices in this graph that are not connected by a path."
