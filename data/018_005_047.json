    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and its complement set A' is the empty set, we need to show that there are no elements that are common to both sets.\n\nLet's denote the intersection of set A and set A' as A ∩ A'. We will now try to find any common elements between set A and set A'.\n\nSet A contains even numbers, while set A' contains odd numbers. Since even numbers are not divisible by 2 and odd numbers are divisible by 2, there cannot be any common elements between the two sets.\n\nTherefore, A ∩ A' = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nThis proves that the intersection of set A and its complement set A' is the empty set."
