    "message_2": "To find the tension in the string, we can use the wave equation for a string fixed at both ends. The wave equation is given by:\n\nv² = T/μ\n\nwhere v is the wave speed, T is the tension, and μ is the linear mass density of the string.\n\nFirst, let's find the linear mass density (μ) of the string:\n\nμ = (mass of the string) / (length of the string)\nμ = 0.01 kg / 10 m\nμ = 0.001 kg/m\n\nNext, we can find the wave speed (v) from the given wave function y(x,t) = 2sin(3x - 4t). The wave speed can be determined from the coefficients of x and t in the wave function:\n\ny(x,t) = 2sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere k is the wave number and ω is the angular frequency. The wave speed is given by:\n\nv = ω/k\n\nFrom the given wave function, we can see that k = 3 and ω = 4. Therefore, the wave speed is:\n\nv = 4 / 3 m/s\n\nNow, we can use the wave equation to find the tension (T):\n\nv² = T/μ\n(4/3)² = T / 0.001\n\nT = 0.001 * (4/3)²\nT = 0.001 * (16/9)\nT = 16/900\nT = 8/450\n\nT ≈ 0.0178 N\n\nThe tension in the string is approximately 0.0178 N."
