    "message_2": "To find the probability of it not raining for four consecutive days, we first need to find the probability of it not raining on a single day. Since the probability of it raining is 0.3, the probability of it not raining is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of it not raining for four consecutive days. Since each day's weather is independent, we can multiply the probabilities of it not raining on each day:\n\n0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.2401\n\nSo, the probability of it not raining for four consecutive days is 0.2401 or 24.01%."
