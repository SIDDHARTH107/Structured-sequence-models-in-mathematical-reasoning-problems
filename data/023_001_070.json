    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given function f(x) = x(2π - x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π (for n = 0, 1, 2, ...)\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π (for n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[x(2π - x) * cos(0)]dx from 0 to 2π\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[x(2π - x)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2(π - x/3)] from 0 to 2π\na_0 = (1/π) * [(8π^3/3) - 4π^3] = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n for n ≥ 1:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x(2π - x) * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(2π - x) * (x * sin(nx)/n) - ∫[sin(nx) - x * cos(nx)/n]dx] from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1/π) * [(2π - x) * (x * sin(nx)/n) + (x * cos(nx)/n^2) - (sin(nx)/n^3)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [0 - 0 + (2π^2/n^2) - (0)] = 4π^2/n^2\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x(2π - x) * sin(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-(2π - x) * (x * cos(nx)/n) - ∫[-cos(nx) - x * sin(nx)/n]dx] from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1/π) * [-(2π - x) * (x * cos(nx)/n) - (x * sin(nx)/n^2) - (cos(nx)/n^3)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [0 - 0 - 0 + (2π/n^3)] = 2π/n^3\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = 0/2 + Σ[(4π^2/n^2) * cos(nx) + (2π/n^3) * sin(nx)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(x) = x(2π - x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(4π^2/n^2) * cos(nx) + (2π/n^3) * sin(nx)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ..."
