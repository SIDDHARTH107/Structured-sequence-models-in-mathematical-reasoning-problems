    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region B enclosed by the curves y = x^3, y = 0, and x = 2 about the y-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of the cross-sectional disks perpendicular to the axis of rotation.\n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y. Since y = x^3, we can rewrite it as x = y^(1/3).\n\nThe volume of a single disk is given by the formula V_disk = πR^2h, where R is the radius and h is the height (thickness) of the disk. In this case, the radius is x (which is y^(1/3)) and the height is a small change in y, denoted as dy.\n\nSo, the volume of a single disk is V_disk = π(y^(1/3))^2 dy = πy^(2/3) dy.\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the range of y values in the region B. Since y = 0 is the lower curve and y = x^3 is the upper curve, the range of y values is from 0 to (2^3) = 8.\n\nSo, the total volume V of the solid is given by the integral:\n\nV = ∫[0, 8] πy^(2/3) dy\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the power rule for integration:\n\nV = π ∫[0, 8] y^(2/3) dy = π [(3/5)y^(5/3)] [0, 8]\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\nV = π [(3/5)(8)^(5/3) - (3/5)(0)^(5/3)]\n\nV = π [(3/5)(32)]\n\nV = (96/5)π\n\nSo, the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region B enclosed by the curves y = x^3, y = 0, and x = 2 about the y-axis is (96/5)π cubic units."
