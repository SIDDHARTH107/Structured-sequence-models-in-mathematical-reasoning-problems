    "message_2": "To find the probability that $X_t > 2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, we first need to find the solution to the given SDE. We can rewrite the SDE as:\n\n$$\\frac{dX_t}{X_t} = -dt + dW_t$$\n\nNow, we integrate both sides over the interval $[0, t]$:\n\n$$\\int_0^t \\frac{dX_s}{X_s} = -\\int_0^t ds + \\int_0^t dW_s$$\n\nApplying the integration, we get:\n\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{X_t}{X_0}\\right) = -t + W_t$$\n\nSince $X_0 = 1$, we have:\n\n$$\\ln(X_t) = -t + W_t$$\n\nExponentiating both sides, we obtain the solution:\n\n$$X_t = e^{-t + W_t}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t > 2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. We can rewrite this inequality as:\n\n$$e^{-t + W_t} > 2$$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n$$-t + W_t > \\ln(2)$$\n\nRearranging the inequality:\n\n$$W_t > t + \\ln(2)$$\n\nSince $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, it has a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$. Therefore, we can rewrite $W_t$ as $W_t = \\sqrt{t}Z$, where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable with mean $0$ and variance $1$. The inequality becomes:\n\n$$\\sqrt{t}Z > t + \\ln(2)$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of this inequality holding for $t \\in [0,1]$. Let's denote the probability as $P(t)$:\n\n$$P(t) = P(\\sqrt{t}Z > t + \\ln(2))$$\n\nSince $Z$ is a standard normal random variable, we can find the probability using the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), denoted by $\\Phi$:\n\n$$P(t) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t + \\ln(2)}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the probability over the interval $t \\in [0,1]$. We can do this by integrating $P(t)$ over the interval:\n\n$$P = \\int_0^1 P(t) dt = \\int_0^1 \\left[1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t + \\ln(2)}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\\right] dt$$\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution, so we would need to use numerical methods to find the probability. However, this integral represents the probability that $X_t > 2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$."
