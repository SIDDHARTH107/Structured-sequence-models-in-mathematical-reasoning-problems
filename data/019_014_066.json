    "message_2": "To prove that there exist exactly 4 groups of order 4 up to isomorphism, we will first list all possible groups of order 4 and then show that they are non-isomorphic.\n\n1. The cyclic group C4: This group has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3}, where a^4 = 1. It has one element of order 4 (a), and the other non-identity elements have order 2 (a^2) and 4 (a^3).\n\n2. The Klein four-group V4: This group has elements {1, a, b, c}, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1 and ab = c, ba = c, ac = b, ca = b, bc = a, cb = a. All non-identity elements have order 2.\n\n3. The dihedral group D4: This group has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b}, where a^4 = 1, b^2 = 1, and bab = a^3. It has one element of order 4 (a), and the other non-identity elements have order 2 (a^2, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b) and 4 (a^3).\n\n4. The quaternion group Q4: This group has elements {1, i, j, k, -1, -i, -j, -k}, where i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. It has one element of order 4 (i), and the other non-identity elements have order 2 (j, k, -1, -i, -j, -k).\n\nNow, we will show that these groups are non-isomorphic:\n\n1. C4 vs. V4: C4 has an element of order 4 (a), while all non-identity elements in V4 have order 2. Therefore, C4 and V4 are not isomorphic.\n\n2. C4 vs. D4: C4 has only one element of order 4 (a), while D4 has two elements of order 4 (a and a^3). Therefore, C4 and D4 are not isomorphic.\n\n3. C4 vs. Q4: C4 has only one element of order 4 (a), while Q4 has three elements of order 4 (i, -i, and -1). Therefore, C4 and Q4 are not isomorphic.\n\n4. V4 vs. D4: V4 has no elements of order 4, while D4 has two elements of order 4 (a and a^3). Therefore, V4 and D4 are not isomorphic.\n\n5. V4 vs. Q4: V4 has no elements of order 4, while Q4 has three elements of order 4 (i, -i, and -1). Therefore, V4 and Q4 are not isomorphic.\n\n6. D4 vs. Q4: D4 has two elements of order 4 (a and a^3), while Q4 has three elements of order 4 (i, -i, and -1). Therefore, D4 and Q4 are not isomorphic.\n\nSince we have shown that these four groups are non-isomorphic, we can conclude that there exist exactly 4 groups of order 4 up to isomorphism."
