    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x + 3 using the Tabu Search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the algorithm with an initial guess of x=0, a domain of x between -5 and 5, a tabu list of length 5, and a maximum of 100 iterations.\n\n2. Define the function f(x) and the neighborhood function, which generates a set of neighboring solutions for a given x value.\n\n3. Run the Tabu Search algorithm, updating the current solution and tabu list at each iteration.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the Tabu Search algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 5*x**2 + x + 3\n\ndef neighborhood(x):\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(-5, 6):\n        new_x = x + i\n        if -5 <= new_x <= 5:\n            neighbors.append(new_x)\n    return neighbors\n\ndef tabu_search(initial_x, domain, tabu_list_length, max_iterations):\n    current_x = initial_x\n    current_value = f(current_x)\n    tabu_list = []\n\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        neighbors = neighborhood(current_x)\n        next_x = None\n        next_value = None\n\n        for x in neighbors:\n            if x not in tabu_list:\n                value = f(x)\n                if next_value is None or value < next_value:\n                    next_x = x\n                    next_value = value\n\n        if next_value < current_value:\n            current_x = next_x\n            current_value = next_value\n\n        tabu_list.append(current_x)\n        if len(tabu_list) > tabu_list_length:\n            tabu_list.pop(0)\n\n    return current_x, current_value\n\ninitial_x = 0\ndomain = (-5, 5)\ntabu_list_length = 5\nmax_iterations = 100\n\nresult_x, result_value = tabu_search(initial_x, domain, tabu_list_length, max_iterations)\nprint(f\"Minimum value found: f({result_x}) = {result_value}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the minimum value of the function f(x) within the specified domain and constraints. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the Tabu Search algorithm."
