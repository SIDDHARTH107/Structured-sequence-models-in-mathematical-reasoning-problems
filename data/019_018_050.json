    "message_2": "To prove the statement using natural deduction, we will first define what it means for an integer to be odd and then proceed with the proof.\n\nDefinition: An integer x is odd if there exists an integer k such that x = 2k + 1.\n\nNow, let's prove the statement ∀x (Odd(x) → Odd(x + 2)) using natural deduction:\n\n1. Assume x is an odd integer (Assumption)\n2. There exists a k such that x = 2k + 1 (Definition of odd integer)\n3. x + 2 = (2k + 1) + 2 (Substitute x with 2k + 1 from step 2)\n4. x + 2 = 2k + 3 (Simplify the expression)\n5. x + 2 = 2(k + 1) + 1 (Factor out 2 from the expression)\n6. Let k' = k + 1, then x + 2 = 2k' + 1 (Substitute k' for k + 1)\n7. There exists a k' such that x + 2 = 2k' + 1 (Existential generalization from step 6)\n8. x + 2 is an odd integer (Definition of odd integer)\n\nTherefore, if x is an odd integer, then x + 2 is an odd integer. Symbolically, we have proven ∀x (Odd(x) → Odd(x + 2))."
