    "message_1": "A company has three machines (M1, M2, and M3) that are used to produce three products (P1, P2, and P3). Each machine can only produce one product at a time, and it takes a different amount of time to produce each product on each machine. The following table shows the production times (in hours) for each product on each machine:\n\n|Machine  | P1 | P2  | P3 |\n|--------|----|-----|----|\n|M1      | 2  | 1.5 | 2.5|\n|M2      | 2.5| 3   | 1.5|\n|M3      | 1.5| 2.5 | 3  |\n\nThe company wants to produce 100 units of each product in the least amount of time possible. What is the optimal production schedule for the company?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production schedule, we need to assign each product to the machine that can produce it the fastest. We can do this by comparing the production times for each product on each machine.\n\nFor Product P1:\nM1 takes 2 hours, M2 takes 2.5 hours, and M3 takes 1.5 hours. The fastest machine for P1 is M3.\n\nFor Product P2:\nM1 takes 1.5 hours, M2 takes 3 hours, and M3 takes 2.5 hours. The fastest machine for P2 is M1.\n\nFor Product P3:\nM1 takes 2.5 hours, M2 takes 1.5 hours, and M3 takes 3 hours. The fastest machine for P3 is M2.\n\nNow that we have assigned each product to its optimal machine, we can calculate the total production time for each machine to produce 100 units of its assigned product.\n\nM1 (producing P2): 1.5 hours * 100 units = 150 hours\nM2 (producing P3): 1.5 hours * 100 units = 150 hours\nM3 (producing P1): 1.5 hours * 100 units = 150 hours\n\nThe optimal production schedule is as follows:\n- M1 produces 100 units of P2 in 150 hours\n- M2 produces 100 units of P3 in 150 hours\n- M3 produces 100 units of P1 in 150 hours\n\nAll machines will finish producing 100 units of their assigned products in 150 hours."
