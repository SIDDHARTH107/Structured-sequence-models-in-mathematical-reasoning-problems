    "message_2": "To show that either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30 or G has at least two elements of order 15, we will use Sylow's Theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of a group is the number of elements in the group. In this case, the order of G is 30. We can factor 30 as 2 * 3 * 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow subgroups of G. By Sylow's First Theorem, G has a subgroup of order 2, a subgroup of order 3, and a subgroup of order 5. Let's denote these subgroups as P2, P3, and P5, respectively.\n\nBy Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for a prime p must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo p. \n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroup (P2), the number of such subgroups must divide 30 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1 or 15. If there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, then it is normal in G.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroup (P3), the number of such subgroups must divide 30 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is 1, so there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, and it is normal in G.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroup (P5), the number of such subgroups must divide 30 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is 1, so there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, and it is normal in G.\n\nNow, since P3 and P5 are both normal in G, their product P3 * P5 is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P3 and P5 are relatively prime (3 and 5), the order of P3 * P5 is 3 * 5 = 15, by the product formula for the orders of subgroups.\n\nIf the order of P2 is 1, then G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and G is isomorphic to C2 x C3 x C5, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n\nIf the order of P2 is 15, then there are 15 distinct elements of order 2 in G. Since P3 * P5 has order 15, there must be at least one element in G that is not in P3 * P5 and has order 2. Let's call this element x. Then, x is in one of the 2-Sylow subgroups, say P2'. Since P2' has order 2, it must consist of the identity element and x.\n\nNow, consider the element y = x(P3 * P5). Since x has order 2 and P3 * P5 has order 15, y has order 15. Moreover, there is another element of order 15, namely (P3 * P5)x, since the product of an element of order 2 and an element of order 15 has order 15.\n\nThus, either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, or G has at least two elements of order 15."
