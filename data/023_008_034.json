    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x(π - x) on the interval [0, π], we need to compute the Fourier series representation of the function. The Fourier series of a function f(x) on the interval [0, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are calculated as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1] dx from 0 to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx from 0 to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx from 0 to π\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x(π - x), we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[x(π - x)] dx from 0 to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x(π - x) * cos(n * x)] dx from 0 to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x(π - x) * sin(n * x)] dx from 0 to π\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2(π - x)/2 - x^3/6] from 0 to π = (π^2/6)\na_n = 0 (since the function is odd and cosine is even, their product will be even, and the integral over a symmetric interval will be 0)\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x(π - x) * sin(n * x)] dx from 0 to π\n\nTo compute b_n, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x(π - x), dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = (π - 2x) dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x(π - x)/n) * cos(n * x) - (1/n) * ∫(π - 2x) * cos(n * x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining term:\n\n∫(π - 2x) * cos(n * x) dx = π * ∫cos(n * x) dx - 2 * ∫x * cos(n * x) dx\n\nThe first term can be integrated directly:\n\n∫π * cos(n * x) dx = (π/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nFor the second term, we can use integration by parts again:\n\nu = x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\n∫x * cos(n * x) dx = (x/n) * sin(n * x) - (1/n) * ∫sin(n * x) dx = (x/n) * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nNow, we can substitute these results back into the expression for b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x(π - x)/n) * cos(n * x) - (1/n) * ((π/n) * sin(n * x) - 2 * ((x/n) * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)))] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nb_n = (2*(-1)^n)/(n^3)\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x(π - x) on the interval [0, π] is:\n\nf(x) = (π^2/6) + Σ [(2*(-1)^n)/(n^3) * sin(n * x)] from n = 1 to infinity"
