    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 3x in the interval [-2, 2], we first need to determine if the function is odd, even, or neither. Since f(-x) = -3x = -f(x), the function is odd. Therefore, we only need to find the sine coefficients (Bn) in the Fourier series.\n\nThe Fourier series of an odd function is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[Bn * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, n is an integer, and Bn is the sine coefficient.\n\nIn our case, the interval is [-2, 2], so L = (2 - (-2))/2 = 2.\n\nNow, let's find the Bn coefficients using the following formula:\n\nBn = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from -L to L\n\nFor f(x) = 3x, we have:\n\nBn = (2/2) * ∫[3x * sin(nπx/2) dx] from -2 to 2\n\nBn = ∫[3x * sin(nπx/2) dx] from -2 to 2\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 3x, dv = sin(nπx/2) dx\ndu = 3 dx, v = (-2/nπ) * cos(nπx/2)\n\nNow, the integration by parts formula is:\n\n∫[u dv] = uv - ∫[v du]\n\nSo, we have:\n\nBn = [(-6x/nπ) * cos(nπx/2)] from -2 to 2 - ∫[(-2/nπ) * cos(nπx/2) * 3 dx] from -2 to 2\n\nBn = [(-6x/nπ) * cos(nπx/2)] from -2 to 2 + (6/nπ) * ∫[cos(nπx/2) dx] from -2 to 2\n\nNow, we integrate cos(nπx/2) dx:\n\n∫[cos(nπx/2) dx] = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)\n\nSo,\n\nBn = [(-6x/nπ) * cos(nπx/2)] from -2 to 2 + (6/nπ) * [(2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)] from -2 to 2\n\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\n\nBn = (-6/nπ) * [cos(nπ) - cos(-nπ)] + (12/n^2π^2) * [sin(nπ) - sin(-nπ)]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = cos(-nπ) and sin(nπ) = sin(-nπ) = 0, we have:\n\nBn = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nSo, all the Bn coefficients are 0. This means that the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 3x in the interval [-2, 2] is identically zero:\n\nf(x) = 0\n\nThis might seem counterintuitive, but it's because the function f(x) = 3x is not periodic in the interval [-2, 2]. The Fourier series is designed to represent periodic functions, and in this case, it fails to represent the non-periodic function f(x) = 3x."
