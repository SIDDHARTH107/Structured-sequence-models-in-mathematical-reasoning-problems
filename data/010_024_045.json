    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a triangle is determined by its angles. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle is:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle. In this case, α = 60 degrees, β = 70 degrees, and γ = x degrees. We are given that the area of the triangle is 12 square units. So,\n\n12 = π - (60° + 70° + x°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angles from degrees to radians:\n\n60° = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n70° = (70 * π) / 180 = 7π/18 radians\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n12 = π - (π/3 + 7π/18 + x)\n\nTo solve for x, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n12 = π - (6π/18 + 7π/18 + x)\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions:\n\n12 = π - (13π/18 + x)\n\nNext, we can subtract π from both sides:\n\n12 - π = -13π/18 + x\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 18 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n18(12 - π) = -13π + 18x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n18x = 13π - 18(12 - π)\n\n18x = 13π - 216 + 18π\n\n18x = 31π - 216\n\nx = (31π - 216) / 18\n\nx ≈ 0.824 radians\n\nTo convert back to degrees:\n\nx ≈ (0.824 * 180) / π ≈ 47.2°\n\nSo, the value of x is approximately 47.2 degrees."
