    "message_2": "To find the length of the perpendicular side, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the base a, the perpendicular side b, and the hypotenuse c.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem is written as:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe are given the values of a (the base) and c (the hypotenuse):\n\na = 10 cm\nc = 15 cm\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n(10 cm)^2 + b^2 = (15 cm)^2\n\n100 cm^2 + b^2 = 225 cm^2\n\nTo find the length of the perpendicular side (b), we can subtract 100 cm^2 from both sides of the equation:\n\nb^2 = 225 cm^2 - 100 cm^2\nb^2 = 125 cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the length of b by taking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √(125 cm^2)\nb ≈ 11.18 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the perpendicular side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter ≈ 10 cm + 11.18 cm + 15 cm\nPerimeter ≈ 36.18 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 36.18 cm."
