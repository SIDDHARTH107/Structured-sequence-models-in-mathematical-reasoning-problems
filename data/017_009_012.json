    "message_2": "To prove that there exists an element of order 9 in G, we will use the fact that the order of an element divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 9, which is a prime number, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 9.\n\nLet's consider the elements of G. By definition, the identity element e has order 1. Now, let's consider any other element a in G. Since a is not the identity element, the order of a cannot be 1. Therefore, the order of a must be 9, as those are the only two possibilities.\n\nSo, there exists an element a in G with order 9."
