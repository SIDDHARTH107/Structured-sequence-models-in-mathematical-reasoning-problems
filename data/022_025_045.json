    "message_2": "First, let's find the second derivative of the wave function $\\psi(x) = e^{-ax^2}$ with respect to $x$. \n\n$$\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = -2ax e^{-ax^2}$$\n\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = 2a e^{-ax^2} - 4a^2x^2 e^{-ax^2} = 2a(1 - 2ax^2)e^{-ax^2}$$\n\nNow, substitute the second derivative and the potential function into the Schrödinger equation:\n\n$$\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2 \\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$$\n\n$$\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}(2a(1 - 2ax^2)e^{-ax^2}) + (6x^2e^{-ax^2}) = Ee^{-ax^2}$$\n\nSince the wave function $\\psi(x)$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $e^{-ax^2}$:\n\n$$\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}(2a(1 - 2ax^2)) + 6x^2 = E$$\n\nNow, we need to find the energy $E$ in electronvolts. To do this, we can convert the potential function from electronvolts to joules by multiplying by the elementary charge $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} C$:\n\n$$V(x) = 6x^2 \\text{ eV} = 6x^2 (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} J)$$\n\nSubstitute the given values of $\\hbar$, $m$, and $a$:\n\n$$\\frac{- (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J.s)^2}{2(9.11 \\times 10^{-31} kg)}(2(2 \\text{ nm}^{-2})(1 - 2(2 \\text{ nm}^{-2})x^2)) + 6x^2 (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} J) = E$$\n\nSince we are interested in the energy $E$ in electronvolts, we can divide both sides by the elementary charge $e$:\n\n$$\\frac{- (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J.s)^2}{2(9.11 \\times 10^{-31} kg)(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} C)}(2(2 \\text{ nm}^{-2})(1 - 2(2 \\text{ nm}^{-2})x^2)) + 6x^2 = E$$\n\nThis equation is still dependent on $x$. To find the energy $E$, we need to find the expectation value of the energy, which is given by:\n\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi^*(x) \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)\\right) \\psi(x) dx$$\n\nHowever, solving this integral analytically is quite challenging. Instead, we can use numerical methods, such as the variational method or numerical integration, to find an approximate value for the energy $E$."
