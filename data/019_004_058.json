    "message_1": "Let's consider the following temporal logic formula: \n```\nF (p ∧ G q)\n```\nwhere `p` and `q` are propositions (statements that are either true or false) representing the following:\n\n- `p`: \"It is sunny today\"\n- `q`: \"I exercise every day\"\n\nThe formula can be read as: \"At some point in the future, `p` is true and for all future times, `q` is true\". \n\nThe problem for the student to solve is to provide a possible scenario where this formula is true. In other words, give an example of a time sequence where at some point in the future it is sunny and from then on, you exercise every day.",
    "message_2": "A possible scenario where the formula F (p ∧ G q) is true can be described as follows:\n\nConsider a sequence of days, starting from today (Day 1) and continuing indefinitely into the future. Let's say that for the first three days, the weather is cloudy and you do not exercise. On Day 4, the weather becomes sunny (p is true) and you decide to start exercising every day from that point onwards (q is true).\n\nThe sequence of days would look like this:\n\n- Day 1: Cloudy, no exercise\n- Day 2: Cloudy, no exercise\n- Day 3: Cloudy, no exercise\n- Day 4: Sunny, exercise (p is true, and q starts being true from this day)\n- Day 5: Rainy, exercise\n- Day 6: Sunny, exercise\n- Day 7: Sunny, exercise\n- ...\n\nFrom Day 4 onwards, you exercise every day, regardless of the weather. This scenario satisfies the temporal logic formula F (p ∧ G q), as there is a point in the future (Day 4) where it is sunny (p is true) and from then on, you exercise every day (G q is true)."
