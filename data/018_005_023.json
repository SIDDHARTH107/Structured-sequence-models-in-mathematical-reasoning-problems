    "message_2": "To find the complement of A (denoted as A'), we need to know the universal set (denoted as U) that A is a subset of. The universal set contains all the elements under consideration for a particular problem. Since the universal set is not provided, let's assume that U = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} for this problem.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A, which consists of all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {0}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and A' (denoted as A ∩ A'). The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'} = {}\n\nSince there are no common elements between A and A', the intersection is an empty set (denoted as {}). This demonstrates that the intersection of a set and its complement is always an empty set."
