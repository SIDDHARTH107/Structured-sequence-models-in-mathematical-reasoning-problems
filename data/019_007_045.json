    "message_1": "Sorry, but it's not possible to provide a precise numerical problem for the subtopic of Non-monotonic logic as it is a type of logic that deals with systems where the addition of new premises may invalidate previously drawn conclusions. It would require a statement or a scenario to apply non-monotonic logic, rather than a precise numerical problem.",
    "message_2": "That's correct. Non-monotonic logic is not a numerical problem but rather a type of logic used in artificial intelligence, reasoning, and knowledge representation. If you have a statement or scenario related to non-monotonic logic, I'd be happy to help you analyze it."
