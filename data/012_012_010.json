    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to find the girth of the graph G, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * (number of edges) / (number of vertices)\n\nIn this case, the number of vertices is 9 and the number of edges is 14. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 14 / 9\ngirth(G) ≤ 28 / 9\ngirth(G) ≤ 3.11\n\nSince the girth must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 4. Therefore, the girth of the graph G is at most 4. Now we need to check if there is a cycle of length 4 in the graph.\n\nConsider a vertex with the highest degree in the graph. Since the graph has 14 edges, the maximum degree of a vertex is at least 14 / 4 = 3.5, which means there is a vertex with a degree of at least 4. Let's call this vertex A.\n\nNow, consider the neighbors of vertex A. Since A has at least 4 neighbors, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one pair of neighbors that share a common neighbor. Let's call these neighbors B and C, and their common neighbor D.\n\nThus, we have a cycle A-B-D-C-A, which is a cycle of length 4. Therefore, the girth of the graph G is 4."
