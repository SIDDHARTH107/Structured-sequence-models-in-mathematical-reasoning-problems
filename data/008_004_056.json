We can write the corresponding system of linear equations:\n\nx - 2y + z = 0\ny - z = 0\nz = 0\n\nFrom the last equation, we have z = 0. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get y = 0. Finally, substituting y = 0 and z = 0 into the first equation, we get x = 0.\n\nSo, the solution to the given homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
