    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nFor the given graph, let's find all the automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism: (A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F)\n2. Swap A and B, and swap C and F: (A B)(C F)(D)(E)\n3. Swap A and C, and swap E and F: (A C)(B)(D)(E F)\n4. Swap B and C, and swap D and E: (A)(B C)(D E)(F)\n5. Swap A and B, swap C and D, and swap E and F: (A B)(C D)(E F)\n6. Swap A and C, swap B and D, and swap E and F: (A C)(B D)(E F)\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of the graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph has 6 elements and can be represented as:\n\n{ (A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F), (A B)(C F)(D)(E), (A C)(B)(D)(E F), (A)(B C)(D E)(F), (A B)(C D)(E F), (A C)(B D)(E F) }"
