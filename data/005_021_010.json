    "message_2": "To construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean income of all households in the neighborhood using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the original sample of 50 households with an average income of $60,000 and a standard deviation of $10,000.\n\n2. Perform a large number of bootstrap resamples (e.g., 10,000) by randomly selecting 50 households with replacement from the original sample. For each resample, calculate the mean income.\n\n3. Arrange the resampled means in ascending order and find the 2.5th percentile (lower bound) and the 97.5th percentile (upper bound) of the resampled means. These percentiles will give you the 95% confidence interval for the mean income of all households in the neighborhood.\n\nNote: Since the actual calculations involve random sampling, the confidence interval may vary slightly each time you perform the bootstrapping. However, the general approach remains the same."
