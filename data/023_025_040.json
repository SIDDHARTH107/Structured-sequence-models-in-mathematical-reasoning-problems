    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∇²T\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator. For a thin circular plate, we can use the polar coordinate system (r, θ) to simplify the Laplacian operator:\n\n∇²T = (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂T/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²T/∂θ²\n\nThe thermal diffusivity α is given by:\n\nα = k/(ρc_p)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and c_p is the specific heat capacity. For copper, we have:\n\nk = 400 W/mK\nρ = 8960 kg/m³\nc_p = 385 J/kgK\n\nCalculating the thermal diffusivity:\n\nα = 400 / (8960 * 385) = 1.173e-4 m²/s\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier transform to solve the heat equation. Let T(r, θ, t) = F(r, θ)G(t). Substituting this into the heat equation and separating variables, we get:\n\n(1/G) ∂G/∂t = α [(1/F) ∂/∂r (r ∂F/∂r) + (1/r²F) ∂²F/∂θ²]\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on the spatial coordinates, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\n(1/G) ∂G/∂t = -λ²\nα [(1/F) ∂/∂r (r ∂F/∂r) + (1/r²F) ∂²F/∂θ²] = -λ²\n\nSolving the time-dependent part:\n\n∂G/∂t = -λ²G\nG(t) = A e^(-λ²t)\n\nSolving the spatial part:\n\n(1/F) ∂/∂r (r ∂F/∂r) + (1/r²F) ∂²F/∂θ² = -λ²/α\n\nThis is a Bessel equation, and its solution can be expressed as a linear combination of Bessel functions:\n\nF(r, θ) = ∑[B_m J_m(λ_m r) e^(i m θ)]\n\nwhere J_m is the m-th order Bessel function, λ_m is the m-th root of the Bessel function, and B_m is a constant.\n\nNow, we need to find the initial temperature distribution:\n\nT(r, θ, 0) = F(r, θ)G(0) = F(r, θ)\n\nSince the initial temperature is 0°C, we have:\n\nF(r, θ) = 0\n\nThis implies that all the B_m coefficients must be zero, so the temperature distribution is:\n\nT(r, θ, t) = 0\n\nTherefore, the temperature distribution over the plate remains at 0°C."
