    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x-3) + 1 = 5, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n√(2x-3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(2x-3))^2 = 4^2\n2x - 3 = 16\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nAdd 3 to both sides of the equation:\n2x = 19\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\nx = 19/2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 19/2."
