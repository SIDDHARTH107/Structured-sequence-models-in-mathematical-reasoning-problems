    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer N such that any graph with N vertices will contain either a complete subgraph with m vertices or an independent set (an empty subgraph) with n vertices.\n\nFor a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5), we are looking for the Ramsey number R(5, 5). The exact value of R(5, 5) is not known, but it is known that 43 ≤ R(5, 5) ≤ 49. This means that the Ramsey number for a complete graph with 5 vertices is between 43 and 49, inclusive."
