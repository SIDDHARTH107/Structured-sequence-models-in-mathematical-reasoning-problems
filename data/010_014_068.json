    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group H^1(X; Z), we will use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Let U be an open set containing the triangle and V be an open set containing the square such that U ∩ V is an open set containing the common edge of the triangle and the square. Then, we have the following Mayer-Vietoris sequence:\n\nH^0(X; Z) → H^0(U; Z) ⊕ H^0(V; Z) → H^0(U ∩ V; Z) → H^1(X; Z) → H^1(U; Z) ⊕ H^1(V; Z) → H^1(U ∩ V; Z)\n\nSince U, V, and U ∩ V are all contractible, their cohomology groups are trivial except for H^0, which is isomorphic to Z. Thus, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence becomes:\n\nZ → Z ⊕ Z → Z → H^1(X; Z) → 0 ⊕ 0 → 0\n\nThe map from Z ⊕ Z to Z is given by (a, b) ↦ a - b. The kernel of this map is the set of pairs (a, b) such that a = b, which is isomorphic to Z. The image of the map from Z to Z ⊕ Z is also isomorphic to Z. Therefore, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have:\n\nH^1(X; Z) ≅ (Z ⊕ Z) / Z ≅ Z\n\nSo, the first cohomology group H^1(X; Z) of X with coefficients in Z is isomorphic to Z."
