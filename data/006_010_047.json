    "message_1": "Out of 500 people in a town, 60% are over the age of 50. Out of these people over 50, 15% have been affected by a certain disease. What is the probability that a randomly selected person from the town is over 50 and has been affected by the disease?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the number of people over the age of 50. Since 60% of the 500 people are over 50, we have:\n\n0.60 * 500 = 300 people over the age of 50.\n\nNext, we need to find how many of these people over 50 have been affected by the disease. Since 15% of the people over 50 have been affected, we have:\n\n0.15 * 300 = 45 people over 50 affected by the disease.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected person from the town is over 50 and has been affected by the disease. To do this, we divide the number of people over 50 with the disease by the total number of people in the town:\n\n45 (people over 50 with the disease) / 500 (total people) = 0.09\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person from the town is over 50 and has been affected by the disease is 0.09 or 9%."
