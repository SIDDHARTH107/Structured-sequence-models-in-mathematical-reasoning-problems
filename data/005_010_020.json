    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs that are labeled as either \"defective\" or \"non-defective.\" The percentage of defective light bulbs produced is known to be 10%. A box contains 15 light bulbs. What is the probability that the box contains exactly 2 defective light bulbs using Bayesian Statistics?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is more appropriate for this type of problem than Bayesian statistics. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective light bulbs in the box\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective light bulbs from a total of n light bulbs\n- n is the total number of light bulbs in the box (15 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective light bulbs (2 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a light bulb being defective (10% or 0.1)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(15, 2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 defective light bulbs from a total of 15:\n\nC(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * (15-2)!)\nC(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * 13!)\nC(15, 2) = (15 * 14) / (2 * 1)\nC(15, 2) = 105\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = 105 * (0.1)^2 * (1-0.1)^(15-2)\nP(X = 2) = 105 * (0.01) * (0.9)^13\nP(X = 2) â‰ˆ 0.2585\n\nSo, the probability that the box contains exactly 2 defective light bulbs is approximately 25.85%."
