    "message_2": "First, note that the order of G is 27 = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 mod 3 and divides 27. Thus, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let P be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is either isomorphic to C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 x C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3).\n\nNow, let's consider the two cases:\n\n1. If there exists an element a in G such that a^3 is not equal to the identity element:\n\nIn this case, the order of a cannot be 1 or 3, so it must be 9 or 27. If the order of a is 27, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C27, which contradicts the assumption that a^3 is not the identity element. Therefore, the order of a must be 9. Since a is not in P (because the order of elements in P is at most 9), we have that G = P <a>, where <a> is the cyclic subgroup generated by a.\n\nNow, let b be an element in P. Since P is normal in G, we have that ab = ba^k for some integer k. Then, (ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = a^3(ba^k)^3 = a^3a^(3k)b^3 = a^(3+3k)b^3. Since a^3 is not the identity element, we have that (ab)^3 is not equal to b^3, which implies that G is non-abelian.\n\nFinally, we have that G is a non-abelian group of order 27, and there is only one such group up to isomorphism, so G must be isomorphic to this non-abelian group of order 27.\n\n2. If for all elements a in G, a^3 is equal to the identity element:\n\nIn this case, G is a 3-group, and by the Burnside's theorem, G must be a direct product of cyclic groups of order 3. Since the order of G is 27, G must be isomorphic to C3 x C3 x C3. However, this contradicts the fact that G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9, which is not a direct product of cyclic groups of order 3.\n\nTherefore, this case is not possible, and G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27."
