If M is a compact oriented smooth manifold without boundary, and $[\\omega]$ is a non-zero element of the top de Rham cohomology of M, what is the possible value of the integral of $\\omega$ over M?",
    "message_2": "Since M is a compact oriented smooth manifold without boundary, we can apply Stokes' theorem to relate the integral of a closed form to its cohomology class. In particular, if $[\\omega]$ is a non-zero element of the top de Rham cohomology of M, then it represents a non-trivial cohomology class. This means that there exists a closed form $\\omega$ that is not exact, i.e., it cannot be written as the exterior derivative of another form.\n\nNow, let's consider the integral of $\\omega$ over M:\n\n$$\\int_M \\omega$$\n\nSince $\\omega$ is closed, we have $d\\omega = 0$. By Stokes' theorem, we have:\n\n$$\\int_M d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$$\n\nHowever, since M is a manifold without boundary, we have $\\partial M = \\emptyset$, and the integral on the right-hand side is zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\int_M d\\omega = 0$$\n\nSince $\\omega$ is not exact, this means that the integral of $\\omega$ over M cannot be zero. In general, the possible values of the integral of $\\omega$ over M will depend on the specific manifold and closed 1-form being considered. However, we can conclude that the integral of $\\omega$ over M must be a non-zero value."
