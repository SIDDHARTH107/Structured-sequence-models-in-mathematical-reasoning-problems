    "message_1": "A school has 10 students and wants to form a committee with a president, a vice president, and a secretary. How many different committees can be formed if Alice refuses to serve as the president and Bob and Carla refuse to serve as secretary at the same time? Use Polya's enumeration theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem by considering the different cases and then summing up the possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Alice is not the president, and neither Bob nor Carla is the secretary.\nThere are 9 choices for the president (everyone except Alice), 8 choices for the vice president (everyone except the president), and 7 choices for the secretary (everyone except the president, vice president, Bob, and Carla). So there are 9 * 8 * 7 = 504 possible committees in this case.\n\nCase 2: Alice is not the president, and Bob is the secretary.\nThere are 9 choices for the president (everyone except Alice), 8 choices for the vice president (everyone except the president and Bob), and 1 choice for the secretary (Bob). So there are 9 * 8 * 1 = 72 possible committees in this case.\n\nCase 3: Alice is not the president, and Carla is the secretary.\nThere are 9 choices for the president (everyone except Alice), 8 choices for the vice president (everyone except the president and Carla), and 1 choice for the secretary (Carla). So there are 9 * 8 * 1 = 72 possible committees in this case.\n\nNow, we sum up the possibilities from all three cases: 504 + 72 + 72 = 648.\n\nTherefore, there are 648 different committees that can be formed under the given conditions."
