    "message_2": "The time complexity of the algorithm that checks if a given number is prime or not depends on the specific algorithm used. However, the most basic algorithm, which checks divisibility by all numbers up to the square root of the given number, has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)). More advanced algorithms, such as the AKS primality test, have a time complexity of O(log(n)^7.5) or better."
