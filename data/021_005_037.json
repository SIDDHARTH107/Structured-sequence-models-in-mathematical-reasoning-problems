    "message_2": "To approximate y(0.2) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.1, we will perform one iteration of the method. Let's denote the given differential equation as dy/dx = f(x, y), where f(x, y) = x - 2y.\n\nThe fourth-order Runge-Kutta method consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate k1: k1 = h * f(x, y)\n2. Calculate k2: k2 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k1/2)\n3. Calculate k3: k3 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k2/2)\n4. Calculate k4: k4 = h * f(x + h, y + k3)\n5. Update y: y_new = y + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to our problem:\n\nInitial condition: x = 0, y = 1, h = 0.1\n\n1. k1 = 0.1 * f(0, 1) = 0.1 * (0 - 2*1) = -0.2\n2. k2 = 0.1 * f(0 + 0.1/2, 1 - 0.2/2) = 0.1 * f(0.05, 0.9) = 0.1 * (0.05 - 2*0.9) = -0.185\n3. k3 = 0.1 * f(0 + 0.1/2, 1 - 0.185/2) = 0.1 * f(0.05, 0.9075) = 0.1 * (0.05 - 2*0.9075) = -0.1765\n4. k4 = 0.1 * f(0 + 0.1, 1 - 0.1765) = 0.1 * f(0.1, 0.8235) = 0.1 * (0.1 - 2*0.8235) = -0.1547\n\nNow, update y:\n\ny_new = 1 + (-0.2 + 2*(-0.185) + 2*(-0.1765) + (-0.1547))/6 = 1 - 0.1795\n\nSo, the approximate value of y(0.2) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.1 is y(0.2) â‰ˆ 1 - 0.1795 = 0.8205."
