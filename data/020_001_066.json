Machine A is available for 6 hours per day and machine B is available for 8 hours per day. Each unit of product X requires 3 hours of machine A and 2 hours of machine B. Each unit of product Y requires 2 hours of machine A and 1 hour of machine B. The profit for each unit of product X is $15 and the profit for each unit of product Y is $10. How many units of each product should be produced to maximize the profit, given the available machine hours?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe constraints for the available machine hours are:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 6 (Machine A)\n2x + y ≤ 8 (Machine B)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 15x + 10y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 6\n2x + y ≤ 8\n\nWe can rewrite the inequalities as:\n\ny ≤ (6 - 3x)/2\ny ≤ 8 - 2x\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points of these inequalities:\n\n(6 - 3x)/2 = 8 - 2x\n6 - 3x = 16 - 4x\nx = 10\n\nHowever, x = 10 is not a feasible solution since it would require more hours of machine A than available. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of y for each inequality:\n\ny ≤ (6 - 3x)/2\ny ≤ 8 - 2x\n\nFor the first inequality, when x = 0:\n\ny ≤ (6 - 3*0)/2\ny ≤ 3\n\nFor the second inequality, when x = 0:\n\ny ≤ 8 - 2*0\ny ≤ 8\n\nSince y ≤ 3 is the more restrictive constraint, we will use that value. Now we can find the maximum profit:\n\nP(x, y) = 15x + 10y\nP(0, 3) = 15*0 + 10*3\nP(0, 3) = 30\n\nThe factory should produce 0 units of product X and 3 units of product Y to maximize the profit, which will be $30."
