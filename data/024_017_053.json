    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v}$ along the curve, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{D\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\vec{r}(t)} \\vec{v} = 0$\n\nwhere $\\vec{r}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix}2t \\\\ 3t^2 \\\\ 4t^3\\end{bmatrix}$ is the position vector of the curve, and $\\nabla_{\\vec{r}(t)}$ is the covariant derivative along the curve.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector $\\vec{T}(t)$ of the curve:\n\n$\\vec{T}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{d(2t)}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{d(3t^2)}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{d(4t^3)}{dt}\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 6t \\\\ 12t^2\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we need to find the covariant derivative of $\\vec{v}$ along the curve:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\vec{r}(t)} \\vec{v} = \\frac{D\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} - \\langle\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}, \\vec{T}(t)\\rangle\\vec{T}(t)$\n\nSince $\\vec{v}$ is a constant vector, its derivative with respect to $t$ is zero:\n\n$\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThus, the covariant derivative of $\\vec{v}$ along the curve is also zero:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\vec{r}(t)} \\vec{v} = \\frac{D\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThis means that the vector $\\vec{v}$ is parallel transported along the curve without any change. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v}$ from $t = 0$ to $t = 1$ is the same vector:\n\n$\\vec{v}_{\\text{parallel transported}} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3\\end{bmatrix}$"
