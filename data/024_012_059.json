    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator of the 2-form ω at a point p in M, we first need to choose a local coordinate system and an orientation for the 3-dimensional manifold M. Let's choose an oriented orthonormal basis {e₁, e₂, e₃} for the tangent space TₚM at the point p, and let {e^₁, e^₂, e^₃} be the corresponding dual basis of the cotangent space T*ₚM.\n\nNow, let's express the 2-form ω in terms of the dual basis:\n\nω = a e^₁ ∧ e^₂ + b e^₁ ∧ e^₃ + c e^₂ ∧ e^₃,\n\nwhere a, b, and c are scalar functions on M.\n\nSince ω ∧ ω ≠ 0, at least one of the coefficients a, b, or c must be nonzero. Without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≠ 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge star operator of ω at the point p:\n\n*ω = (1/a) e^₃.\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this calculation:\n\nThe Hodge star operator maps a k-form to an (n-k)-form, where n is the dimension of the manifold. In our case, n = 3, and we're working with a 2-form, so the Hodge star operator maps ω to a 1-form.\n\nThe Hodge star operator is defined such that for any k-form α and (n-k)-form β, we have α ∧ *β = ⟨α, β⟩ dV, where ⟨α, β⟩ is the inner product of α and β, and dV is the volume form on M.\n\nIn our case, we want to find the 1-form *ω such that for any 2-form η = d e^₁ ∧ e^₂ + f e^₁ ∧ e^₃ + g e^₂ ∧ e^₃, we have ω ∧ *η = ⟨ω, η⟩ dV.\n\nUsing the properties of the wedge product and the fact that e^i ∧ e^i = 0, we get:\n\nω ∧ *η = a e^₁ ∧ e^₂ ∧ *η + b e^₁ ∧ e^₃ ∧ *η + c e^₂ ∧ e^₃ ∧ *η.\n\nNow, we want this expression to be equal to ⟨ω, η⟩ dV = (ad + bf + cg) e^₁ ∧ e^₂ ∧ e^₃.\n\nComparing the two expressions, we see that we must have *η = (1/a) e^₃, so that:\n\n*ω = (1/a) e^₃."
