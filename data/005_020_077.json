Generate 10,000 random points inside a square of side 10 units that circumscribes the circle. Calculate the number of points that lie inside the circle using the formula x^2 + y^2 <= r^2, where x and y are the coordinates of the point and r is the radius of the circle. Use this information to estimate the area of the circle.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the area of the circle using Monte Carlo simulation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate 10,000 random points inside the square of side 10 units that circumscribes the circle.\n2. Calculate the number of points that lie inside the circle using the formula x^2 + y^2 <= r^2.\n3. Use the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points to estimate the area of the circle.\n\nFirst, let's generate 10,000 random points inside the square:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nnum_points = 10000\npoints = [(random.uniform(-5, 5), random.uniform(-5, 5)) for _ in range(num_points)]\n```\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of points that lie inside the circle:\n\n```python\ndef is_inside_circle(point, radius):\n    x, y = point\n    return x**2 + y**2 <= radius**2\n\nradius = 5\npoints_inside_circle = [point for point in points if is_inside_circle(point, radius)]\nnum_points_inside_circle = len(points_inside_circle)\n```\n\nNow, let's use the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points to estimate the area of the circle:\n\n```python\ncircle_area_ratio = num_points_inside_circle / num_points\nsquare_area = 10 * 10  # Side length of the square is 10 units\nestimated_circle_area = circle_area_ratio * square_area\n```\n\nFinally, we can print the estimated area of the circle:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Estimated area of the circle:\", estimated_circle_area)\n```\n\nThis code will output an estimated area of the circle, which should be close to the actual area (78.54 square units) since we used a large number of random points (10,000) in the Monte Carlo simulation. Note that the result may vary slightly each time the code is run due to the randomness of the points generated."
