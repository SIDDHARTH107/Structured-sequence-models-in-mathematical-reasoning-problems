    "message_2": "To determine the number of Sylow-3 subgroups in a group of order 36, we use Sylow's Theorems. Let G be a group of order 36, and let n_3 be the number of Sylow-3 subgroups of G. By Sylow's Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_3 divides the index of the Sylow-3 subgroup, which is |G|/|P| = 36/3 = 12, where |P| is the order of a Sylow-3 subgroup (which is 3).\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFrom these conditions, the possible values for n_3 are 1, 3, 4, and 12. However, since n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3, we can eliminate 4. Thus, the distinct possibilities for the number of Sylow-3 subgroups in a group of order 36 are 1, 3, and 12.\n\nNow, let's classify all groups of order 36 up to isomorphism using this information:\n\n1. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow-3 subgroup, which is normal in G. Let P be the unique Sylow-3 subgroup and Q be a Sylow-2 subgroup. Since |P| = 3 and |Q| = 4, we have that P is isomorphic to either Z_3 or Z_3 x Z_3, and Q is isomorphic to either Z_4 or Z_2 x Z_2. However, since |P| is prime, P must be isomorphic to Z_3. Therefore, G is a semidirect product of P and Q. If Q is isomorphic to Z_4, then G is isomorphic to either Z_3 x Z_4 or Z_12. If Q is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_2, then G is isomorphic to either Z_3 x (Z_2 x Z_2) or a non-abelian group of order 36.\n\n2. If n_3 = 3, there are three distinct Sylow-3 subgroups, none of which are normal in G. In this case, G cannot be a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups, and G must be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 36.\n\n3. If n_3 = 12, there are twelve distinct Sylow-3 subgroups, none of which are normal in G. In this case, G cannot be a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups, and G must be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 36.\n\nIn summary, the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 36 are:\n\n1. Z_3 x Z_4\n2. Z_12\n3. Z_3 x (Z_2 x Z_2)\n4. A non-abelian group of order 36"
