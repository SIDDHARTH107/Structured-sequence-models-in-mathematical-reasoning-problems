    "message_1": "Consider a topological quantum field theory that assigns to each closed oriented 2-manifold a vector space over the field of complex numbers. Let the vector space assigned to the 2-sphere be two dimensional. Suppose the TQFT satisfies the Turaev-Viro axioms. Find the dimension of the vector space assigned to the orientable genus 3 surface by the TQFT.",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the vector space assigned to the orientable genus 3 surface by the TQFT, we can use the Turaev-Viro axioms and the fact that the vector space assigned to the 2-sphere is two-dimensional.\n\nAccording to the Turaev-Viro axioms, the dimension of the vector space assigned to a closed oriented surface is given by the product of the dimensions of the vector spaces assigned to the connected components of the surface.\n\nLet's denote the dimension of the vector space assigned to the orientable genus g surface as V(g). We are given that V(0) = 2 (since the 2-sphere is the genus 0 surface).\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the connected sum of two surfaces corresponds to the tensor product of their vector spaces. In other words, V(g1) ⊗ V(g2) = V(g1 + g2).\n\nFor the orientable genus 3 surface, we can express it as the connected sum of three 2-spheres (genus 0 surfaces):\n\nV(3) = V(0) ⊗ V(0) ⊗ V(0)\n\nSince V(0) = 2, we have:\n\nV(3) = 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the vector space assigned to the orientable genus 3 surface by the TQFT is 8."
