    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the intersection cohomology group $IH^1(X)$, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, which relates the cohomology of a projective variety to that of a hyperplane section.\n\nIn this case, the curve X is a cubic curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have that the cohomology groups of X are isomorphic to those of a generic hyperplane section, which in this case is a smooth cubic curve. Therefore, we can compute the cohomology groups of a smooth cubic curve and use this information to determine the intersection cohomology groups of X.\n\nA smooth cubic curve is a genus 1 curve, which is an elliptic curve. The cohomology groups of an elliptic curve are given by:\n\n$H^0(E) = \\mathbb{C}$,\n$H^1(E) = \\mathbb{C}^{2g}$,\n$H^2(E) = \\mathbb{C}$,\n\nwhere g is the genus of the curve. In this case, g = 1, so we have:\n\n$H^0(E) = \\mathbb{C}$,\n$H^1(E) = \\mathbb{C}^2$,\n$H^2(E) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, the intersection cohomology groups of X are given by the cohomology groups of a smooth cubic curve:\n\n$IH^0(X) = H^0(E) = \\mathbb{C}$,\n$IH^1(X) = H^1(E) = \\mathbb{C}^2$,\n$IH^2(X) = H^2(E) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group $IH^1(X)$ is 2."
