    "message_2": "A Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The perimeter of a Koch island after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of sides) * (4/3)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 1, and the initial equilateral triangle has 3 sides. We want to find the perimeter after the fifth iteration (n = 5).\n\nPerimeter = 1 * 3 * (4/3)^5\nPerimeter = 3 * (1024/243)\nPerimeter ≈ 3 * 4.214\nPerimeter ≈ 12.642\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after the fifth iteration is approximately 12.642 units."
