    "message_1": "A tree is located 50 meters away from a building. If the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the tree is 60 degrees, and the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the building is 45 degrees, what is the height of the tree?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the tree as h1 and the height of the building as h2. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation, distance, and height for both the tree and the building.\n\nFor the tree:\ntan(60°) = h1 / 50\n\nFor the building:\ntan(45°) = h2 / 50\n\nNow, we can solve for h1 and h2.\n\nFor the building:\ntan(45°) = 1 (since the tangent of 45 degrees is 1)\nh2 = 50 * 1\nh2 = 50 meters\n\nFor the tree:\ntan(60°) = sqrt(3) (since the tangent of 60 degrees is sqrt(3))\nh1 = 50 * sqrt(3)\nh1 ≈ 50 * 1.732\nh1 ≈ 86.6 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree is approximately 86.6 meters."
