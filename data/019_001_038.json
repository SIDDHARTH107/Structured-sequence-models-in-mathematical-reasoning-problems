    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the compound proposition, we will evaluate each part of the proposition using the given values of p and q.\n\nGiven: p is true and q is false.\n\n1. (p ∧ q): This is a conjunction, which means it is true if and only if both p and q are true. Since p is true and q is false, (p ∧ q) is false.\n\n2. ¬p: This is the negation of p. Since p is true, ¬p is false.\n\nNow, we have the compound proposition:\n\n(false) ∨ (false)\n\n3. (p ∧ q) ∨ ¬p: This is a disjunction, which means it is true if at least one of the propositions is true. Since both (p ∧ q) and ¬p are false, the entire proposition (p ∧ q) ∨ ¬p is false."
