    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 9 and let a be an element of order 3 in G, i.e., a^3 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Since the order of G is 9, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which is a subgroup of order 3. Let H be such a subgroup. Since the order of H is 3, which is prime, H is cyclic and generated by a, i.e., H = {e, a, a^2}.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 9.\nLet b be an element of order 9 in G. Then, the cyclic group generated by b, denoted by <b>, has order 9 and contains all the elements of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 9.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 3. Let b be an element in G but not in H (since H has only elements of order 3 and the identity). Then, the order of b is also 3, and the subgroup K generated by b is of order 3, i.e., K = {e, b, b^2}.\n\nSince the order of G is 9, the product of the orders of H and K must be equal to the order of G, i.e., |H||K| = |G|. Therefore, the intersection of H and K must be trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}.\n\nNow, let's consider the set HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. Since |H| = 3 and |K| = 3, |HK| = 9. Moreover, since H ∩ K = {e}, the elements of HK are distinct. Therefore, HK = G.\n\nNow, we define a map φ: H × K → G by φ(h, k) = hk. Since HK = G, φ is surjective. We will show that φ is also a homomorphism. Let (h1, k1) and (h2, k2) be elements of H × K. Then,\n\nφ((h1, k1)(h2, k2)) = φ(h1h2, k1k2) = h1h2k1k2.\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nφ(h1, k1)φ(h2, k2) = h1k1h2k2.\n\nSince G is non-abelian, we cannot guarantee that k1h2 = h2k1. However, we can show that there exists a non-abelian group of order 9 with this property. Let G' be the group of 3x3 matrices of the form\n\n[[1, a, c],\n [0, 1, b],\n [0, 0, 1]]\n\nwith a, b, and c in the field F_3 (the integers modulo 3). G' is a non-abelian group of order 9, and it can be shown that it satisfies the conditions we have derived for G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to this non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 9, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. If it does not have an element of order 9, it is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 9."
