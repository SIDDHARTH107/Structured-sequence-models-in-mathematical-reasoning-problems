    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * cos(x), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of two functions multiplied together is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In this case, let u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = cos(x).\n\nu'(x) = 2x (derivative of x^2)\nv'(x) = -sin(x) (derivative of cos(x))\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (2x)(cos(x)) + (x^2)(-sin(x))\nf'(x) = 2x*cos(x) - x^2*sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/2:\n\nf'(π/2) = 2(π/2)*cos(π/2) - (π/2)^2*sin(π/2)\nf'(π/2) = π*cos(π/2) - (π^2/4)*sin(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1, we have:\n\nf'(π/2) = π*0 - (π^2/4)*1\nf'(π/2) = -π^2/4"
