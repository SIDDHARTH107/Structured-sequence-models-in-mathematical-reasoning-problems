    "message_2": "Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. Let x be the horizontal distance between the observer and the balloon, y be the vertical distance between the observer and the balloon, and z be the distance between the observer and the balloon (the hypotenuse). We have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = z^2\n\nWe are given that dy/dt = 10 ft/s (the rate at which the balloon is rising) and dz/dt = 15 ft/s (the rate at which the distance between the observer and the balloon is increasing) when y = 500 ft. We want to find dz/dt when y = 1000 ft.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between x and y when y = 500 ft. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + (500)^2 = z^2\n\nNow, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 2z(dz/dt)\n\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx(dx/dt) + y(dy/dt) = z(dz/dt)\n\nWe know that dy/dt = 10 ft/s and dz/dt = 15 ft/s when y = 500 ft. We can plug these values into the equation:\n\nx(dx/dt) + 500(10) = z(15)\n\nNow we need to find the values of x and z when y = 500 ft. We can use the equation x^2 + (500)^2 = z^2 to find the value of z:\n\nz = sqrt(x^2 + (500)^2)\n\nSince we don't have enough information to find the exact value of x, we will express the relationship between x and z when y = 1000 ft using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + (1000)^2 = z'^2\n\nNow we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nx(dx/dt) + 1000(dy/dt) = z'(dz'/dt)\n\nWe know that dy/dt = 10 ft/s when y = 1000 ft. We can plug this value into the equation:\n\nx(dx/dt) + 1000(10) = z'(dz'/dt)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two unknowns (x and dz'/dt):\n\n1) x(dx/dt) + 500(10) = z(15)\n2) x(dx/dt) + 1000(10) = z'(dz'/dt)\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by dividing equation 2 by equation 1:\n\n(1000(10))/(500(10)) = (z'(dz'/dt))/(z(15))\n\n2 = (z'(dz'/dt))/(z(15))\n\nNow, we can solve for dz'/dt:\n\ndz'/dt = (2z(15))/z'\n\nWe know that z = sqrt(x^2 + (500)^2) and z' = sqrt(x^2 + (1000)^2). Since the balloon is rising vertically, the horizontal distance x remains constant. Therefore, we can write:\n\nz' = 2z\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the equation for dz'/dt:\n\ndz'/dt = (2z(15))/(2z)\n\ndz'/dt = 15 ft/s\n\nSo, the balloon is moving away from the observer at a rate of 15 ft/s when it is 1000 ft high."
