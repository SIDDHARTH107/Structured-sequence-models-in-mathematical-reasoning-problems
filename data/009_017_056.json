Using Maxwell's equations, find the induced electric field at a point 3 meters from the wire in the z-direction.",
    "message_2": "To find the induced electric field at a point 3 meters from the wire in the z-direction, we can use Ampere's law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field produced by the wire at the given point. The magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying a current I is given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\nB = (μ₀I)/(2πr)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the wire to the point of interest. In this case, r = 3 meters.\n\nUsing the permeability of free space, μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A, and the given current, I = 2A, we can find the magnetic field produced by the wire:\n\nB_wire = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 2A) / (2π × 3m) = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 6m = (4/3) × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, we have two magnetic fields acting on the point: the uniform magnetic field in the x-direction (B_x = 0.5 T) and the magnetic field produced by the wire (B_wire = (4/3) × 10^(-7) T). Since the wire's magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction, it does not affect the x-component of the total magnetic field. Thus, the total magnetic field at the point is:\n\nB_total = B_x + B_wire = 0.5 T + (4/3) × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's law, another one of Maxwell's equations, to find the induced electric field (E) at the point. Faraday's law states that the closed line integral of the electric field around a loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux (Φ) through the loop:\n\n∮E⋅dl = -dΦ/dt\n\nSince the magnetic field is uniform and not changing with time, the rate of change of the magnetic flux is zero:\n\ndΦ/dt = 0\n\nTherefore, the closed line integral of the electric field is also zero:\n\n∮E⋅dl = 0\n\nThis means that there is no induced electric field at the point 3 meters from the wire in the z-direction due to the uniform magnetic field and the current-carrying wire."
