    "message_1": "A group of 50 students were asked about their favorite subjects in school. 25 students said they like Mathematics, 20 students said they like Science, and 15 students said they like History. 10 students said they like both Mathematics and Science, 5 students said they like both Mathematics and History, and 8 students said they like both Science and History. If 3 students were chosen at random, what is the probability that at least one of them likes Mathematics? Use the Inclusion-Exclusion principle to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of the three students chosen at random likes Mathematics, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that none of the three students like Mathematics.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of students who do not like Mathematics. We know that:\n\n- 25 students like Mathematics\n- 10 students like both Mathematics and Science\n- 5 students like both Mathematics and History\n\nSo, there are 25 - 10 - 5 = 10 students who like only Mathematics.\n\nNow, there are 50 - 25 = 25 students who do not like Mathematics.\n\nThe probability that the first student chosen does not like Mathematics is 25/50. After choosing the first student, there are 49 students left. The probability that the second student chosen does not like Mathematics is 24/49. After choosing the second student, there are 48 students left. The probability that the third student chosen does not like Mathematics is 23/48.\n\nSo, the probability that none of the three students like Mathematics is (25/50) * (24/49) * (23/48) = 0.2122.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability that at least one of the three students likes Mathematics:\n\n1 - 0.2122 = 0.7878.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the three students chosen at random likes Mathematics is approximately 0.7878 or 78.78%."
