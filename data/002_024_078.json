    "message_1": "A trapezium has two parallel sides, one of length 7 cm and the other of length 12 cm. The distance between these sides is 5 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of these sides. Since the trapezium can be divided into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side, we can find the length of a and b using the theorem.\n\nLet's call the length of the shorter parallel side A (7 cm) and the length of the longer parallel side B (12 cm). The distance between the parallel sides is h (5 cm). Now, let's find the length of the base of each right triangle.\n\nThe base of the first right triangle is (B - A) / 2 = (12 - 7) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side a:\n\na^2 = h^2 + (2.5)^2\na^2 = 5^2 + 2.5^2\na^2 = 25 + 6.25\na^2 = 31.25\na = √31.25 ≈ 5.59 cm\n\nSince the trapezium is symmetrical, the length of side b is also 5.59 cm.\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = A + B + a + b\nPerimeter = 7 + 12 + 5.59 + 5.59\nPerimeter ≈ 30.18 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 30.18 cm."
