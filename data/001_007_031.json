    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 > 5x - 7, we need to isolate x on one side of the inequality. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 2x from both sides of the inequality.\n3 > 3x - 7\n\nStep 2: Add 7 to both sides of the inequality.\n10 > 3x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 3.\n10/3 > x\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x < 10/3."
