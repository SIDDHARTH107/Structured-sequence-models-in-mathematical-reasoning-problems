    "message_2": "To determine the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph G, we need to analyze the graph's structure. However, without any specific information about the graph's layout or connectivity, it is impossible to provide an exact number of cut vertices and bridges.\n\nA cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn general, the number of cut vertices and bridges depends on the graph's structure, such as whether it is a tree, a cycle, or a more complex graph. For example, if the graph is a tree (i.e., a connected graph with no cycles), then every edge is a bridge, and every non-leaf vertex is a cut vertex. On the other hand, if the graph is a cycle, there are no cut vertices or bridges.\n\nWithout more information about the graph G, we cannot determine the exact number of cut vertices and bridges."
