    "message_2": "The first player has the winning strategy. Here's what they should do to guarantee a win:\n\n1. In the first turn, the first player should remove 1 stone from the pile. This leaves 8 stones in the pile.\n2. From this point on, the first player should mimic the second player's move in the previous turn. For example, if the second player removes 1 stone, the first player should also remove 1 stone in their next turn. If the second player removes 2 stones, the first player should also remove 2 stones in their next turn.\n\nBy following this strategy, the first player ensures that they will always be the one to remove the last stone and win the game. Here's why:\n\n- If the second player removes 1 stone, there will be 7 stones left. The first player also removes 1 stone, leaving 6 stones. They continue this pattern until there are 2 stones left, at which point the first player removes both stones and wins.\n- If the second player removes 2 stones, there will be 6 stones left. The first player also removes 2 stones, leaving 4 stones. They continue this pattern until there are 2 stones left, at which point the first player removes both stones and wins.\n\nIn either case, the first player is guaranteed to win by following this strategy."
