    "message_1": "How many elements of order 2 does a non-abelian group of order 16 have, and which one of the three groups (C16, D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16) could it be?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze each group:\n\n1. C16: This is the cyclic group of order 16. It has only one element of order 2, which is the element that is half of the generator (e.g., if the generator is g, then g^8 has order 2). Since C16 is an abelian group, it does not meet the non-abelian requirement.\n\n2. D8: This is the dihedral group of order 16 (8 reflections and 8 rotations). In D8, there are 5 elements of order 2: one is the half-rotation, and the other four are the reflections. D8 is a non-abelian group, so it meets the requirement.\n\n3. Q16: This is the quaternion group of order 16, which is also a non-abelian group. In Q16, there are 8 elements of order 2.\n\nTherefore, the non-abelian groups of order 16 are D8 and Q16. D8 has 5 elements of order 2, and Q16 has 8 elements of order 2."
