    "message_2": "Since (A × B) and (A × B) are the same set, their union is just the set itself. The Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) where x is an element of A and y is an element of B. So, we have:\n\nA × B = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}\n\nTherefore, (A × B) ∪ (A × B) = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}"
