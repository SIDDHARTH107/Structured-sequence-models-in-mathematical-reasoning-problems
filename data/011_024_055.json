    "message_1": "A factory has three assembly lines, each producing a different product. Line 1 produces 300 units per hour, Line 2 produces 200 units per hour, and Line 3 produces 400 units per hour. The factory needs to supply a total of 800 units per hour to a customer. Using network flow algorithms, determine the maximum number of units that can be supplied from the factory to the customer per hour.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of units that can be supplied from the factory to the customer per hour, we can use the network flow algorithm. In this case, we can model the problem as a flow network with the following nodes and edges:\n\n1. Source node (S)\n2. Line 1 node (L1)\n3. Line 2 node (L2)\n4. Line 3 node (L3)\n5. Customer node (C)\n6. Sink node (T)\n\nWe can then create the following edges with capacities:\n\n1. (S, L1) with capacity 300 units/hour\n2. (S, L2) with capacity 200 units/hour\n3. (S, L3) with capacity 400 units/hour\n4. (L1, C) with capacity 300 units/hour\n5. (L2, C) with capacity 200 units/hour\n6. (L3, C) with capacity 400 units/hour\n7. (C, T) with capacity 800 units/hour\n\nNow, we can apply the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow from the source node (S) to the sink node (T).\n\n1. Start with an initial flow of 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph.\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nAfter applying the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we find that the maximum flow from the source node (S) to the sink node (T) is 900 units/hour. However, the customer only needs 800 units/hour, so the factory can supply the required 800 units/hour to the customer."
