    "message_2": "In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nTo find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 30-degree angle, we can use the following definitions:\n\n1. sine (sin) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n2. cosine (cos) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.\n3. tangent (tan) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the adjacent side.\n\nFor the 30-degree angle:\n\n1. sin(30) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 1/2\n2. cos(30) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = √3/2\n3. tan(30) = opposite side / adjacent side = 1/√3\n\nSo, the sine of the 30-degree angle is 1/2, the cosine is √3/2, and the tangent is 1/√3."
