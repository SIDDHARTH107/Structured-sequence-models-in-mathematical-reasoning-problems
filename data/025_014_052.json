    "message_2": "To find the number of linearly independent holomorphic differentials of the third kind on $X$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g$ and a divisor $D$ on $X$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_X - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only along $D$, $K_X$ is the canonical divisor of $X$, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the genus $g$ of the curve $X$. We can use the formula for the genus of a smooth plane curve of degree $d$:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$\n\nIn our case, $d = 4$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2} = 3$\n\nNow, we want to find the number of linearly independent holomorphic differentials of the third kind, which are meromorphic differentials with residues summing to zero at their poles. In other words, we want to find $l(3K_X)$, where $K_X$ is the canonical divisor of $X$.\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$l(3K_X) - l(2K_X) = \\deg(3K_X) + 1 - g$\n\nSince $K_X$ is the canonical divisor, we know that $\\deg(K_X) = 2g - 2 = 2 \\cdot 3 - 2 = 4$. Therefore, $\\deg(3K_X) = 3 \\cdot 4 = 12$, and we have:\n\n$l(3K_X) - l(2K_X) = 12 + 1 - 3 = 10$\n\nNow, we need to find $l(2K_X)$. By the Riemann-Roch theorem again, we have:\n\n$l(K_X) - l(K_X - 2K_X) = \\deg(2K_X) + 1 - g$\n\nSince $\\deg(2K_X) = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$, we have:\n\n$l(K_X) - l(K_X - 2K_X) = 8 + 1 - 3 = 6$\n\nBut $l(K_X - 2K_X) = 0$ because $K_X - 2K_X$ is a negative divisor, so we get:\n\n$l(K_X) = 6$\n\nNow, we can find $l(3K_X)$:\n\n$l(3K_X) = l(2K_X) + 10 = 6 + 10 = 16$\n\nThus, there are 16 linearly independent holomorphic differentials of the third kind on the smooth plane quartic curve $X$."
