    "message_2": "To find the average temperature based on the sine values recorded, we first need to convert the sine values back to their corresponding temperature values. Since we don't have the actual sine values, we'll assume that the student measured the temperature at equal intervals within the given range (10°C to 30°C).\n\n1. Divide the temperature range into equal intervals for the 12 measurements:\n   (30°C - 10°C) / 12 = 20°C / 12 = 1.67°C\n\n2. Calculate the temperature values for each interval:\n   T1 = 10°C\n   T2 = 10°C + 1.67°C\n   T3 = 10°C + 2 * 1.67°C\n   ...\n   T12 = 10°C + 11 * 1.67°C\n\n3. Convert the temperature values to sine values:\n   sin(T1), sin(T2), ..., sin(T12)\n\n4. Convert the sine values back to their corresponding temperature values:\n   arcsin(sin(T1)), arcsin(sin(T2)), ..., arcsin(sin(T12))\n\n5. Calculate the average temperature:\n   (arcsin(sin(T1)) + arcsin(sin(T2)) + ... + arcsin(sin(T12))) / 12\n\nSince we don't have the actual sine values, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, this is the process that should be followed to find the average temperature based on the sine values recorded."
