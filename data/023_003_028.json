The thermal conductivity of the rod is 0.5 units and its cross-sectional area is 2 square units. Assume that the rod is cooled by a surrounding environment that maintains a temperature of 0°C, and that the rod is initially at the same temperature as its environment.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution u(x,t) of the insulated rod, we can use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k * ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature distribution, k is the thermal conductivity, and x and t are the spatial and time variables, respectively.\n\nSince we are looking for the steady-state temperature distribution, the temperature does not change with time, so ∂u/∂t = 0. The equation becomes:\n\n0 = k * ∂²u/∂x²\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for u(x). First, integrate with respect to x:\n\n∂u/∂x = C₁\n\nIntegrate again with respect to x:\n\nu(x) = C₁x + C₂\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. At x = 0, u(0) = 100°C\n2. At x = 1, u(1) = 50°C\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n\n100 = C₁(0) + C₂\nC₂ = 100\n\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n\n50 = C₁(1) + 100\nC₁ = -50\n\nSo, the steady-state temperature distribution is:\n\nu(x) = -50x + 100\n\nThis equation describes the temperature distribution along the insulated rod at any given time in the steady-state condition."
