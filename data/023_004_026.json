    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-jωx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the entire real line.\n\nHowever, since f(x) = e^(-4x) for x > 0 and f(x) = 0 for x ≤ 0, we can modify the integral limits accordingly:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-4x) * e^(-jωx)] dx, where the integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, let's combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-x(4 + jω))] dx, from 0 to infinity.\n\nThis is an integral of the form ∫[e^(-ax)] dx, which can be solved as -[e^(-ax) / a], evaluated from 0 to infinity. In our case, a = 4 + jω.\n\nF(ω) = -[e^(-x(4 + jω)) / (4 + jω)] from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limits:\n\nAt x = infinity, the exponential term e^(-x(4 + jω)) goes to 0, so the whole expression becomes 0.\n\nAt x = 0, the exponential term e^(-x(4 + jω)) becomes 1, so the expression becomes -1 / (4 + jω).\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of f(x) = e^(-4x) for x > 0 is:\n\nF(ω) = 1 / (4 + jω)."
