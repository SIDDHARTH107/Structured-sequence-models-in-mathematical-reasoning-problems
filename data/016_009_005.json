    "message_2": "The length of the dragon curve doubles with each iteration. After the first iteration, the length is 2, after the second iteration, the length is 4, and so on. \n\nTo find the total length of the curve after 10 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * 2^(number of iterations)\n\nLength = 1 * 2^10\n\nLength = 1 * 1024\n\nLength = 1024\n\nSo, the total length of the curve after 10 iterations is 1024."
