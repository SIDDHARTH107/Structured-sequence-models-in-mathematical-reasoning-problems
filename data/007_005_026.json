    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 12 and 30 is the smallest number that both 12 and 30 can divide into evenly. To find the LCM, you can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 12: 2^2 * 3\nPrime factorization of 30: 2 * 3 * 5\n\nNow, take the highest powers of each prime factor and multiply them together:\n\n2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60\n\nSo, the LCM of 12 and 30 is 60."
