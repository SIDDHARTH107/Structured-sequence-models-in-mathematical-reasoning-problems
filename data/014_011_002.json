    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MEET ME AT THE PARK\" using a transposition cipher with a key of \"4 3 1 2\", we first need to remove the spaces and arrange the message in a grid with 4 columns, since the key has 4 numbers.\n\nThe message without spaces is \"MEETMEATTHEPARK\".\n\nNow, we arrange the message in a grid with 4 columns:\n\nM E E T\nM E A T\nT H E P\nA R K\n\nNext, we rearrange the columns according to the key \"4 3 1 2\":\n\nT E M E\nT A M E\nP E T H\nK R A\n\nFinally, we read the encrypted message by rows:\n\nThe encrypted message is \"TEMETAMEPETHKRA\"."
