    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (4x^2 + 3x - 2) / (2x - 1), we will use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative f'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / (h(x))^2.\n\nLet g(x) = 4x^2 + 3x - 2 and h(x) = 2x - 1.\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d/dx (4x^2 + 3x - 2) = 8x + 3\nh'(x) = d/dx (2x - 1) = 2\n\nNow, we apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\nf'(x) = ((8x + 3)(2x - 1) - (4x^2 + 3x - 2)(2)) / (2x - 1)^2\nf'(x) = (16x^2 - 8x + 6x - 3 - 8x^2 - 6x + 4) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)\nf'(x) = (16x^2 - 8x^2 + 6x - 6x - 3 + 4) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)\nf'(x) = (8x^2 - 1) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (4x^2 + 3x - 2) / (2x - 1) is f'(x) = (8x^2 - 1) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)."
