    "message_2": "First, we will write the given system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 |  0 ]\n[ 3  1  1 |  4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -12 ]\n[ 0 -2 -2 | -14 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  4 ]\n[ 0 -2 -2 | -14 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Add 2 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  4 ]\n[ 0  0 -4/3 | -6 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Multiply the third row by -3/4:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  4 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  3 ]\n```\n\nNow that we have the matrix in row-echelon form, we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nStep 1: z = 3\n\nStep 2: y - (1/3)z = 4 => y - (1/3)(3) = 4 => y = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nStep 3: x + y + z = 6 => x + 5 + 3 = 6 => x = -2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -2, y = 5, and z = 3."
