    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of X, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets U and V such that their intersection U ∩ V is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X can be computed as the amalgamated free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, with respect to their intersection U ∩ V.\n\nLet's consider the following decomposition of X:\n\n1. Let U be an open set containing the circle and a small portion of the line segment.\n2. Let V be an open set containing the line segment and a small portion of the circle.\n\nBoth U and V are path-connected, and their intersection U ∩ V is also path-connected since it contains a small portion of the circle and the line segment.\n\nNow, let's compute the fundamental groups of U, V, and U ∩ V:\n\n1. The fundamental group of U, denoted π₁(U), is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the circle, which is the infinite cyclic group Z (the integers under addition). This is because U deformation retracts onto the circle.\n2. The fundamental group of V, denoted π₁(V), is trivial since V is contractible (it can be continuously shrunk to a point).\n3. The fundamental group of U ∩ V, denoted π₁(U ∩ V), is also trivial since U ∩ V is contractible.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of X, denoted π₁(X), is the amalgamated free product of π₁(U) and π₁(V) with respect to π₁(U ∩ V). Since π₁(V) and π₁(U ∩ V) are both trivial, the amalgamated free product is just the fundamental group of U, which is isomorphic to Z.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group Z."
