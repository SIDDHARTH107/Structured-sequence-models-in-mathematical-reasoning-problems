    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression $\\log_{2}(64)-\\log_{2}(8)$, we can use the logarithmic property:\n\n$\\log_{b}(a) - \\log_{b}(c) = \\log_{b}(\\frac{a}{c})$\n\nApplying this property to the given expression, we get:\n\n$\\log_{2}(64)-\\log_{2}(8) = \\log_{2}(\\frac{64}{8})$\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction:\n\n$\\frac{64}{8} = 8$\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n$\\log_{2}(8)$\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent to which the base (2) must be raised to obtain the number (8). In other words, we need to find the value of x in the equation:\n\n$2^x = 8$\n\nSince $2^3 = 8$, the value of x is 3. Therefore, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\n$\\log_{2}(8) = 3$"
