    "message_2": "To prove that there exist only three non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 18. Since 18 = 2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 2 and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 9 in G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can only be 1.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, both P and Q are normal in G since they are unique. By the normality of P and Q, we have that G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Since P is of order 2 and Q is of order 9, we have G ≅ Z_2 × Z_9. This is the first non-isomorphic group of order 18.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, Q is still normal in G. Let H be any Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, |HQ| = |H||Q|/|H ∩ Q| = 2 * 9 / 1 = 18, so G = HQ. Since Q is normal in G, we have that G is a semidirect product of H and Q, i.e., G ≅ H ⋊ Q. The action of H on Q is determined by the automorphism group of Q, which is Aut(Q) ≅ Z_6 (since Q is isomorphic to Z_9). \n\nThere are two possible actions of H on Q: the trivial action and the action given by the automorphism of order 2 in Aut(Q). \n\nFor the trivial action, we have G ≅ H × Q ≅ Z_2 × Z_9, which is the same as in Case 1.\n\nFor the action given by the automorphism of order 2 in Aut(Q), we obtain a non-abelian group of order 18. This is the second non-isomorphic group of order 18.\n\nThus, there are only three non-isomorphic groups of order 18: Z_18, Z_2 × Z_9, and the non-abelian group obtained in Case 2.\n\nNow, let's find all the generators of the cyclic group of order 18, which is Z_18. The generators of Z_18 are the elements that are relatively prime to 18. These are:\n\n1, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nSo, the generators of the cyclic group of order 18 are 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17."
