    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the vector equation r(t) with respect to t.\n\nr(t) = <cos(t), sin(t), t>\nr'(t) = <-sin(t), cos(t), 1>\nr''(t) = <-cos(t), -sin(t), 0>\n\nNow, we need to find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) at the point corresponding to t = π/2. The formulas for curvature and torsion are as follows:\n\nCurvature (k) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\nTorsion (τ) = (r'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t))) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = <1*cos(t) - 0, 0 - (-1)*(-sin(t)), -sin(t)*(-sin(t)) - cos(t)*cos(t)>\nr'(t) x r''(t) = <cos(t), -sin(t), -1>\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt((-sin(t))^2 + cos(t)^2 + 1^2)\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(1)\n\nNow, let's find the curvature (k) at t = π/2:\n\nk = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\nk = ||<cos(π/2), -sin(π/2), -1>|| / (1)^3\nk = ||<0, -1, -1>|| / 1\nk = sqrt(0^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2)\nk = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the curvature at t = π/2 is k = sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ) at t = π/2:\n\nτ = (r'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t))) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\nτ = (<-sin(π/2), cos(π/2), 1> • <cos(π/2), -sin(π/2), -1>) / ||<cos(π/2), -sin(π/2), -1>||^2\nτ = (-1*0 + 0*(-1) + 1*(-1)) / (sqrt(2))^2\nτ = -1 / 2\n\nSo, the torsion at t = π/2 is τ = -1/2.\n\nIn conclusion, the curvature and torsion of the curve at the point corresponding to t = π/2 are k = sqrt(2) and τ = -1/2, respectively."
