Suppose that the De Rham cohomology group $H^1_{DR}(S)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and that the flow $X$ has three periodic orbits with periods $1$, $2$, and $3$. \n\nWhat is the sum of the indices of the three periodic orbits of $X$ on $S$?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the three periodic orbits as $O_1$, $O_2$, and $O_3$ with periods $1$, $2$, and $3$, respectively. Let $i(O_k)$ be the index of the periodic orbit $O_k$. We want to find the sum $i(O_1) + i(O_2) + i(O_3)$.\n\nSince $X$ is a Hamiltonian flow on the surface $S$, it preserves the symplectic form $\\omega$ on $S$. The Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that the sum of the indices of all periodic orbits of a vector field on a closed surface is equal to the Euler characteristic of the surface, which is given by $\\chi(S) = \\#V - \\#E + \\#F$, where $\\#V$, $\\#E$, and $\\#F$ are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of a triangulation of $S$, respectively.\n\nNow, we are given that the De Rham cohomology group $H^1_{DR}(S)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This implies that the first Betti number of $S$, $b_1(S)$, is equal to $3$. The Euler-Poincaré formula states that $\\chi(S) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k b_k(S)$, where $b_k(S)$ is the $k$-th Betti number of $S$. Since $S$ is a surface, we have $n = 2$. Thus, we have $\\chi(S) = b_0(S) - b_1(S) + b_2(S)$.\n\nSince $S$ is connected, we have $b_0(S) = 1$. Moreover, we know that $b_1(S) = 3$. To find $b_2(S)$, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic of a surface is even. Therefore, we must have $\\chi(S) = 1 - 3 + b_2(S) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This implies that $b_2(S)$ must be even. Since $S$ is a smooth, closed surface, the minimum value for $b_2(S)$ is $0$. Therefore, we have $b_2(S) = 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic of $S$: $\\chi(S) = 1 - 3 + 0 = -2$. By the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, the sum of the indices of the three periodic orbits of $X$ on $S$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of $S$. Thus, we have $i(O_1) + i(O_2) + i(O_3) = -2$."
