    "message_1": "A torus has a minor radius of 3 cm and a major radius of 5 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 5 cm and r = 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 5 * 3^3\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 5 * 27\n\nVolume = 270 * π^2\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π^2 as 9.8696.\n\nVolume ≈ 270 * 9.8696\n\nVolume ≈ 2666.792 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 2666.792 cubic centimeters."
