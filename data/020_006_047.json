Each unit of A requires 3 hours of work and earns a profit of $100, while each unit of B requires 5 hours of work and earns a profit of $200. The company has 10 workers, each working for 40 hours per week. How many units of A and B should the company produce each week to maximize profits while ensuring that the number of units of A and B are integers?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe total working hours available per week is 10 workers * 40 hours/worker = 400 hours.\n\nThe constraint for the working hours is:\n3x + 5y ≤ 400\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit, which is given by:\nProfit = 100x + 200y\n\nTo find the integer values of x and y that maximize the profit, we can use integer linear programming or simply test different combinations of x and y that satisfy the constraint.\n\nWe can start by finding the maximum possible value of x (when y = 0):\n3x ≤ 400\nx ≤ 400/3\nx ≤ 133.33\n\nSince x must be an integer, the maximum value of x is 133.\n\nNow, we can test different combinations of x and y, starting with the highest value of x and decreasing it, while checking if the corresponding value of y is an integer.\n\nFor x = 133:\n3x + 5y = 400\n3(133) + 5y = 400\n399 + 5y = 400\n5y = 1\ny = 0.2 (not an integer)\n\nFor x = 132:\n3x + 5y = 400\n3(132) + 5y = 400\n396 + 5y = 400\n5y = 4\ny = 0.8 (not an integer)\n\nFor x = 131:\n3x + 5y = 400\n3(131) + 5y = 400\n393 + 5y = 400\n5y = 7\ny = 1.4 (not an integer)\n\nFor x = 130:\n3x + 5y = 400\n3(130) + 5y = 400\n390 + 5y = 400\n5y = 10\ny = 2 (an integer)\n\nSo, the company should produce 130 units of Product A and 2 units of Product B to maximize the profit while ensuring that the number of units of A and B are integers.\n\nThe maximum profit will be:\nProfit = 100x + 200y = 100(130) + 200(2) = 13,000 + 400 = $13,400 per week."
