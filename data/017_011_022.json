    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 12, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 12. Then, |G| = 2^2 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3, and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 4, and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFrom these conditions, we have that n_2 can be 1 or 3, and n_3 can be 1 or 4. We will analyze each case and show that the only possible isomorphism classes are C12, A4, and D6.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G since they are unique. We have |P| = 4 and |Q| = 3. Since P and Q are normal, their product PQ is a subgroup of G, and |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 12. Thus, G = PQ, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. Since P is a group of order 4 and Q is a group of order 3, G is isomorphic to C4 × C3, which is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. There are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and they are all conjugate to each other. Let P be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since |Q| = 3, Q is isomorphic to C3. Since |P| = 4, P is either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If P is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Q and P, which is D6. If P is isomorphic to V4, then G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. However, this case is not possible because the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must be congruent to 1 mod 3, and 4 does not satisfy this condition.\n\nTherefore, the only possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 12 are C12, A4, and D6. Every group of order 12 must have a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup, and by analyzing the possible numbers of these subgroups, we have shown that every group of order 12 is isomorphic to one of these three groups."
