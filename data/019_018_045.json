By definition, an even integer can be represented as 2n, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, let a = 2m and b = 2n, where m and n are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of a and b:\n\na + b = 2m + 2n\n\nWe can factor out the common factor of 2:\n\na + b = 2(m + n)\n\nSince m and n are integers, their sum (m + n) is also an integer. Let's call this integer k:\n\na + b = 2k\n\nSince 2k is an even integer (as it is a multiple of 2), we have proven that the sum of any two even integers is even."
