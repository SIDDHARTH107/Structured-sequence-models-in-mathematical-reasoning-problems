    "message_2": "First, let's write the given system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the constant terms column vector.\n\nA = | 3 -2  4 |\n    | 2  1 -2 |\n    | 1  4  2 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 18 |\n    |  2 |\n    | 34 |\n\nNow, let's convert the matrix A into a sparse matrix representation. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the matrix A is already a dense matrix, meaning that most of its elements are non-zero. Therefore, there is no need to convert it into a sparse matrix.\n\nTo solve the system Ax = b, we can use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\n1. First, we'll perform row operations to convert matrix A into an upper triangular matrix:\n\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1:\nA = | 3  -2   4 |\n    | 0   5/3 -10/3 |\n    | 1   4   2 |\n\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R1:\nA = | 3  -2   4 |\n    | 0   5/3 -10/3 |\n    | 0   14/3  2/3 |\n\nR3 = R3 - (14/5)R2:\nA = | 3  -2   4 |\n    | 0   5/3 -10/3 |\n    | 0   0    12 |\n\n2. Now, we can perform back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = 12 / 12 = 1\n\ny = (10/3 - (-10/3)(1)) / (5/3) = 2\n\nx = (18 - (-2)(2) - 4(1)) / 3 = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 2, and z = 1."
