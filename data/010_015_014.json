    "message_2": "To compute the second De Rham cohomology group $H^2_{\\text{dR}}(M)$, we first need to find a basis for the closed 2-forms on $M$ and then determine which of these are exact.\n\nSince $M$ is a two-dimensional torus, we can parameterize it using the coordinates $(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$, where $0 \\leq \\theta_1, \\theta_2 < 2\\pi$. The torus can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ using the following parameterization:\n\n$$\nx = (R + r\\cos\\theta_2)\\cos\\theta_1, \\\\\ny = (R + r\\cos\\theta_2)\\sin\\theta_1, \\\\\nz = r\\sin\\theta_2,\n$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube, and $r$ is the radius of the tube.\n\nNow, let's compute the basis for the closed 2-forms on $M$. Since $M$ is two-dimensional, there is only one possible 2-form, which is the area form:\n\n$$\n\\omega = d\\theta_1 \\wedge d\\theta_2.\n$$\n\nTo determine if this form is closed, we need to compute its exterior derivative:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = d(d\\theta_1 \\wedge d\\theta_2) = 0,\n$$\n\nsince the exterior derivative of a 2-form in a 2-dimensional space is always zero. Therefore, $\\omega$ is closed.\n\nNow we need to determine if $\\omega$ is exact. A 2-form $\\omega$ is exact if there exists a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that $\\omega = d\\alpha$. In our case, since the torus is compact and connected, the only exact 2-forms are those with zero integral over the whole torus. Let's compute the integral of $\\omega$ over $M$:\n\n$$\n\\int_M \\omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta_1 \\wedge d\\theta_2 = (2\\pi)^2.\n$$\n\nSince the integral is nonzero, $\\omega$ is not exact. Therefore, the second De Rham cohomology group $H^2_{\\text{dR}}(M)$ is one-dimensional and has a basis given by the area form $\\omega$:\n\n$$\nH^2_{\\text{dR}}(M) = \\text{span}\\{\\omega\\}.\n$$"
