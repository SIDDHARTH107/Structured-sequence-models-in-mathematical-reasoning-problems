    "message_2": "To determine the frequency content of the given signal f(t) = cos(t) + cos(2t) + cos(3t), we can use the Fourier series representation for periodic functions. The Fourier series representation of a periodic function is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(nωt) + bn * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients, ω is the angular frequency, and n is the harmonic number.\n\nFor the given function, we can see that it is already in the Fourier series form, with no sine terms (bn = 0 for all n). The Fourier coefficients are:\n\na0 = 0 (since there is no constant term)\na1 = 1 (coefficient of cos(t))\na2 = 1 (coefficient of cos(2t))\na3 = 1 (coefficient of cos(3t))\n\nThe fundamental frequency (n = 1) is given by ω = 2π/T, where T is the period of the function. Since the function is a sum of cosines with different frequencies, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the individual cosine functions to find the overall period T.\n\nFor cos(t), T1 = 2π\nFor cos(2t), T2 = π\nFor cos(3t), T3 = 2π/3\n\nThe LCM of T1, T2, and T3 is 2π. Therefore, the fundamental frequency is ω = 2π/T = 2π/(2π) = 1.\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series representation of the given function:\n\nf(t) = cos(t) + cos(2t) + cos(3t)\n\nThe frequency content of the signal is given by the frequencies of the cosine terms:\n\n1st harmonic: ω1 = 1 (fundamental frequency)\n2nd harmonic: ω2 = 2\n3rd harmonic: ω3 = 3\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal is {1, 2, 3}."
