    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest possible vertex cover for the given graph G.\n\nTo find the minimum-sized vertex cover, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start with an empty set and iteratively add vertices to the set, choosing the vertex that covers the most uncovered edges at each step.\n\n1. Start with an empty set: {}\n2. Vertex 3 covers the most uncovered edges (3 edges: (1, 3), (2, 3), and (3, 4)). Add vertex 3 to the set: {3}\n3. Vertex 4 covers the most uncovered edges (2 edges: (4, 5) and (4, 6)). Add vertex 4 to the set: {3, 4}\n4. All edges are now covered, so we stop.\n\nThe minimum-sized vertex cover of G is {3, 4}, and its size is 2."
