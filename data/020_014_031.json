    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 4 over the domain 0 ≤ x ≤ 4, we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\nFactor the equation:\n\n(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, x = 4 and x = 2 are the critical points.\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the domain (x = 0 and x = 4):\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 9(0)^2 + 24(0) + 4 = 4\nf(2) = 2^3 - 9(2)^2 + 24(2) + 4 = -4\nf(4) = 4^3 - 9(4)^2 + 24(4) + 4 = 0\n\nThe maximum value of f(x) occurs at x = 0, and the maximum value is f(0) = 4."
