    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x), we first need to find the first derivative of f(x). \n\nThe derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x). So, the first derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = e^x + cos(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of f(x) by taking the derivative of f'(x):\n\nThe derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). So, the second derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf''(x) = e^x - sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 0:\n\nf''(0) = e^0 - sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) at x = 0 is 1."
