    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the algebraic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 5, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 4x - 5. Then, the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 4\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J is given by:\n\nJ = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n    | -3x^2 + 4  2y |\n\nNow, we need to find the torsion subgroup of the Jacobian. The torsion subgroup consists of points on the curve that are annihilated by some integer larger than 1. In other words, we are looking for points (x, y) on the curve such that n * (x, y) = O, where n > 1 and O is the identity element (the point at infinity) in the Jacobian.\n\nTo find the torsion subgroup, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the rational points on the curve.\n2. Compute the group law on the curve to find the multiples of the rational points.\n3. Determine the smallest integer n > 1 such that n * (x, y) = O for each rational point (x, y).\n\nFor the given curve y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 5, finding all the rational points is not feasible. However, we can find some rational points and their multiples to get an idea of the torsion subgroup.\n\nLet's consider the point P = (1, 0) on the curve. We can compute the multiples of P:\n\n2P = (1, 0) + (1, 0) = O (since the tangent line at P is vertical)\n3P = 2P + P = O + (1, 0) = (1, 0)\n\nFrom this, we can see that the point P has order 2, as 2P = O. Therefore, the torsion subgroup of the Jacobian contains at least the point P.\n\nTo find more points and their orders, we would need to perform a more exhaustive search or use more advanced techniques such as the Nagell-Lutz theorem or the Mordell-Weil theorem. However, this example demonstrates the basic idea of finding the torsion subgroup of the Jacobian of an algebraic curve."
