    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to row reduce the matrix to its row echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n   `[ 1  2 -3\n     -4  5  6\n      7 -8  9 ]`\n\nStep 1: Add 4 times the first row to the second row to eliminate the -4 in the second row.\n\n   `[ 1  2  -3\n      0  13  6\n      7 -8  9 ]`\n\nStep 2: Subtract 7 times the first row from the third row to eliminate the 7 in the third row.\n\n   `[ 1  2  -3\n      0  13  6\n      0 -22 30 ]`\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 13 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n\n   `[ 1  2  -3\n      0  1  6/13\n      0 -22 30 ]`\n\nStep 4: Add 22 times the second row to the third row to eliminate the -22 in the third row.\n\n   `[ 1  2  -3\n      0  1  6/13\n      0  0  292/13 ]`\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by (292/13) to get a leading 1 in the third row.\n\n   `[ 1  2  -3\n      0  1  6/13\n      0  0  1 ]`\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form, and we can see that there are 3 non-zero rows, which means the rank of the matrix A is 3."
