    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the control system using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transforms of the input and output signals.\n\nLet's denote the Fourier transform of x(t) as X(ω) and the Fourier transform of y(t) as Y(ω).\n\nThe input signal x(t) is given as:\n\nx(t) = 5sin(2πt)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of x(t), we get:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[5sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nThe Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF{sin(at)} = (j/2) * [δ(ω - a) - δ(ω + a)]\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of x(t) is:\n\nX(ω) = (5j/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the output signal y(t):\n\ny(t) = 20sin(2πt - π/2) + 10cos(4πt + π)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of y(t), we get:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[20sin(2πt - π/2) * e^(-jωt)] dt + ∫[10cos(4πt + π) * e^(-jωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nUsing the Fourier transform properties for sine and cosine functions, we get:\n\nY(ω) = 10j * [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)] + 5 * [δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) by dividing the Fourier transform of the output signal Y(ω) by the Fourier transform of the input signal X(ω):\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / X(ω)\n\nH(ω) = [10j * (δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)) + 5 * (δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π))] / [(5j/2) * (δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π))]\n\nH(ω) = 2 * [2j * (δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)) + (δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π))]\n\nSo, the transfer function of the control system is:\n\nH(ω) = 4j * (δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)) + 2 * (δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π))"
