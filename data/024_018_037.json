    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface S at the point (1,1,-1) in the direction of the vector v = 2i + 3j + 4k, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S by the position vector r(u,v) = (u, v, uv - u^2 - v^2). Then, we can find the tangent vectors r_u and r_v:\n\nr_u = ∂r/∂u = (1, 0, v - 2u)\nr_v = ∂r/∂v = (0, 1, u - 2v)\n\nNow, we can find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, v - 2u) • (1, 0, v - 2u) = 1 + (v - 2u)^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, v - 2u) • (0, 1, u - 2v) = (v - 2u)(u - 2v)\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, u - 2v) • (0, 1, u - 2v) = 1 + (u - 2v)^2\n\nNext, we find the normal vector N to the surface:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, v - 2u) × (0, 1, u - 2v) = (2u - v, 2v - u, 1)\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • ∂^2r/∂u^2 = (2u - v, 2v - u, 1) • (0, 0, -2) = -2\nM = N • ∂^2r/∂u∂v = (2u - v, 2v - u, 1) • (0, 0, 1) = 1\nN = N • ∂^2r/∂v^2 = (2u - v, 2v - u, 1) • (0, 0, -2) = -2\n\nNow, we can find the sectional curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,-1), we have:\n\nE = 1 + (1 - 2)^2 = 2\nF = (1 - 2)(1 - 2) = 1\nG = 1 + (1 - 2)^2 = 2\nL = -2\nM = 1\nN = -2\n\nSo, K = (-2 * -2 - 1^2) / (2 * 2 - 1^2) = (4 - 1) / (4 - 1) = 3 / 3 = 1\n\nTherefore, the sectional curvature of the surface S at the point (1,1,-1) in the direction of the vector v = 2i + 3j + 4k is 1."
