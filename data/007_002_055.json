    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 11, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. \n\nThe prime factorization of each number is:\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n5 = 5\n11 = 11\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in the given numbers. In this case, all the prime factors are unique, so the LCM is:\n\nLCM = 2 × 3 × 5 × 11 = 330\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 11 is 330."
