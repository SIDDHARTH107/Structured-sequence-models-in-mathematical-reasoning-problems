    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent (i.e., there is an edge between every pair of vertices in the clique). To determine the maximum number of vertices that can form a clique in a graph with 8 vertices and 15 edges, we can use the formula for the maximum number of edges in a complete graph:\n\nNumber of edges in a complete graph with n vertices = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nWe need to find the largest n such that the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is less than or equal to 15.\n\nFor n = 1, number of edges = 1 * (1 - 1) / 2 = 0\nFor n = 2, number of edges = 2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1\nFor n = 3, number of edges = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3\nFor n = 4, number of edges = 4 * (4 - 1) / 2 = 6\nFor n = 5, number of edges = 5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 10\nFor n = 6, number of edges = 6 * (6 - 1) / 2 = 15\n\nWhen n = 7, the number of edges = 7 * (7 - 1) / 2 = 21, which is greater than 15. Therefore, the maximum number of vertices that can form a clique in this graph is 6."
