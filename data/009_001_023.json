    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(rt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth constant, and t is the time in days.\n\nIn this case, P0 = 100 rabbits, r = 0.3 rabbits/day, and t = 5 days.\n\nP(5) = 100 * e^(0.3 * 5)\n\nP(5) = 100 * e^1.5\n\nP(5) ≈ 100 * 4.4817\n\nP(5) ≈ 448.17\n\nAfter 5 days, there will be approximately 448 rabbits in the population."
