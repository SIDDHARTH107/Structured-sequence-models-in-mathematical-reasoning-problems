    "message_1": "A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at a rate of 3 m/s^2. How long will it take for the car to reach a speed of 60 km/h?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the speed from km/h to m/s.\n\n60 km/h * (1000 m/km) * (1 h/3600 s) = 60 * (10/36) m/s = 50/3 m/s\n\nNow we can use the formula for uniformly accelerated motion:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nIn this case, u = 0 (since the car starts from rest), v = 50/3 m/s, and a = 3 m/s^2. We need to find t.\n\n50/3 = 0 + 3t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = (50/3) / 3\n\nt = 50/9 s\n\nSo, it will take the car approximately 50/9 seconds, or about 5.56 seconds, to reach a speed of 60 km/h."
