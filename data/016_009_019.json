    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal pattern that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The total length of the Dragon Curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal length = Initial length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, and we want to find the total length after 14 iterations. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nTotal length = 1 * (2^14)\n\nTotal length = 1 * 16,384\n\nTotal length = 16,384 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon Curve after 14 iterations is 16,384 units."
