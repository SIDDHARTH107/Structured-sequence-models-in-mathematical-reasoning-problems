    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x - 10 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = -3, and c = -10.\n\nx = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(-10))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (3 ± √(9 + 40)) / 2\n\nx = (3 ± √49) / 2\n\nx = (3 ± 7) / 2\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (3 + 7) / 2\nx = 10 / 2\nx = 5\n\n2) x = (3 - 7) / 2\nx = -4 / 2\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x - 10 = 0 are x = 5 and x = -2."
