    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the math student to solve related to Cryptanalysis of Playfair cipher:\n\nSuppose you intercept a Playfair cipher message that contains the following digraphs: FG, JU, DQ, XA, and CM. You also know that the key matrix used to encrypt the message had the following layout:\n\n| F | G | H | I | K |\n| L | M | N | O | P |\n| Q | R | S | T | U |\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n\nUsing this information, determine the plaintext message for the encrypted message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher message, we will apply the decryption rules to each digraph in the message using the provided key matrix.\n\n1. If both letters in the digraph are in the same row, replace each letter with the letter to its left (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters in the digraph are in the same column, replace each letter with the letter above it (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters in the digraph are in different rows and columns, replace each letter with the letter in its row that is in the same column as the other letter in the digraph.\n\nNow, let's decrypt each digraph:\n\n1. FG: Both letters are in the same row. Replace F with K and G with F. The decrypted digraph is KF.\n2. JU: J is not in the key matrix, so we replace it with I (as I and J are combined in the Playfair cipher). I and U are in different rows and columns. Replace I with H (same row as I, same column as U) and U with S (same row as U, same column as I). The decrypted digraph is HS.\n3. DQ: Both letters are in the same column. Replace D with C and Q with P. The decrypted digraph is CP.\n4. XA: Both letters are in different rows and columns. Replace X with W (same row as X, same column as A) and A with V (same row as A, same column as X). The decrypted digraph is WV.\n5. CM: Both letters are in the same row. Replace C with B and M with L. The decrypted digraph is BL.\n\nPutting the decrypted digraphs together, we get the plaintext message: KFHS_CPWV_BL. Note that the underscores represent spaces in the original message."
