    "message_1": "In a game of Cheap Talk, Player 1 wants to coordinate on a strategy with Player 2. Each player can either truthfully communicate their intended action or lie about it. If both players communicate the same action, they get a payoff of 10. If they communicate different actions, they get a payoff of 0. If a player lies, they pay a cost of 1. If Player 1 communicates \"left\" with probability p and Player 2 communicates \"left\" with probability q, what is the probability that they coordinate on \"left\" and get a payoff of 10?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both players coordinate on \"left\" and get a payoff of 10, we need to find the probability that both players communicate \"left\" and actually choose \"left\" as their action.\n\nLet's denote the probability of Player 1 choosing \"left\" as P1 and the probability of Player 2 choosing \"left\" as P2. Then, the probability of both players choosing \"left\" is P1 * P2.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that both players communicate \"left\" given that they have chosen \"left\". Since Player 1 communicates \"left\" with probability p and Player 2 communicates \"left\" with probability q, the probability that both players communicate \"left\" given that they have chosen \"left\" is p * q.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both players coordinate on \"left\" and get a payoff of 10 is the product of the probability that both players choose \"left\" and the probability that both players communicate \"left\" given that they have chosen \"left\":\n\nProbability (coordinate on \"left\") = P1 * P2 * p * q"
