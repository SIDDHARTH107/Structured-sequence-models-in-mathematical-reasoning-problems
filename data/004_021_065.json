    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 8, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x).\n\nThe first derivative is found by differentiating each term of the function with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3)/dx - d(5x^2)/dx + d(7x)/dx - d(8)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation (d(x^n)/dx = nx^(n-1)), we get:\n\nf'(x) = (3)(2)x^(3-1) - (2)(5)x^(2-1) + (1)(7)x^(1-1) - 0\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 7\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d(6x^2)/dx - d(10x)/dx + d(7)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = (2)(6)x^(2-1) - (1)(10)x^(1-1) + 0\nf''(x) = 12x - 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 8 is f''(x) = 12x - 10."
