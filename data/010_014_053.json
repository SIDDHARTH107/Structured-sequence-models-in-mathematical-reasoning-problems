    "message_2": "Let X be a 3-dimensional sphere, denoted as S^3. To compute the second cohomology group H^2(X), we can use the fact that the cohomology groups of spheres are well-known.\n\nFor a sphere S^n, the cohomology groups H^k(S^n) are given by:\n\nH^k(S^n) = Z if k = 0 or k = n,\nH^k(S^n) = 0 otherwise,\n\nwhere Z denotes the group of integers.\n\nIn our case, we have n = 3, and we want to compute H^2(S^3). Since 2 is not equal to 0 or 3, we have:\n\nH^2(S^3) = 0.\n\nSo, the second cohomology group of a 3-dimensional sphere is the trivial group."
