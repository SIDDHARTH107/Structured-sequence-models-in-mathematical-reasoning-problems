    "message_2": "To compute the Tutte polynomial T(x, y) of the given graph, we will use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G) = T(G - e) + T(G / e) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G) = x * T(G / e) if e is a bridge,\nT(G) = y * T(G - e) if e is a loop.\n\nHere, G is the graph, e is an edge, G - e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nThe given graph G has six vertices and the following edges: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6). There are no loops in the graph. We will compute the Tutte polynomial by recursively applying the formula.\n\nFirst, we will remove the edge (1, 2) and contract it. The resulting graphs are:\n\nG - (1, 2): edges (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\nG / (1, 2): edges (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\n\nNow, we will remove the edge (1, 3) and contract it in both G - (1, 2) and G / (1, 2):\n\nG - (1, 2) - (1, 3): edges (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\nG - (1, 2) / (1, 3): edges (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\nG / (1, 2) - (1, 3): edges (1, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\nG / (1, 2) / (1, 3): edges (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)\n\nNotice that G - (1, 2) - (1, 3) and G - (1, 2) / (1, 3) are isomorphic, so their Tutte polynomials will be the same. We will compute the Tutte polynomial for G - (1, 2) - (1, 3) and multiply it by 2.\n\nNext, we will remove the edge (2, 3) and contract it in G - (1, 2) - (1, 3):\n\nG - (1, 2) - (1, 3) - (2, 3): edges (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\nG - (1, 2) - (1, 3) / (2, 3): edges (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\n\nAgain, these two graphs are isomorphic, so their Tutte polynomials will be the same. We will compute the Tutte polynomial for G - (1, 2) - (1, 3) - (2, 3) and multiply it by 2.\n\nFinally, we will remove the edge (2, 4) and contract it in G - (1, 2) - (1, 3) - (2, 3):\n\nG - (1, 2) - (1, 3) - (2, 3) - (2, 4): edges (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\nG - (1, 2) - (1, 3) - (2, 3) / (2, 4): edges (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\n\nThese two graphs are also isomorphic, so their Tutte polynomials will be the same. We will compute the Tutte polynomial for G - (1, 2) - (1, 3) - (2, 3) - (2, 4) and multiply it by 2.\n\nNow, we have reached graphs with no more bridges. The Tutte polynomial for a graph with no edges and n vertices is x^(n-1). In our case, n = 4, so the Tutte polynomial for each of the graphs we reached is x^3.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\nT(G) = 2 * (2 * (2 * x^3)) = 8x^3\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is T(x, y) = 8x^3."
