    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To find the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph, we can use a greedy algorithm.\n\n1. Select the vertex with the highest degree (most connected edges). In this case, it's vertex D with a degree of 4.\n2. Remove all edges connected to the selected vertex.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all edges are covered.\n\nFollowing this algorithm:\n\n1. Select vertex D and remove its edges (A-D, C-D, D-E, D-H).\n2. The remaining edges are A-B, B-F, C-G, and F-I. Select vertex B and remove its edges (A-B, B-F).\n3. The remaining edges are C-G and F-I. Select vertex C and remove its edge (C-G).\n4. The remaining edge is F-I. Select vertex F and remove its edge (F-I).\n\nThe minimum vertex cover for this graph is {D, B, C, F} with a size of 4."
