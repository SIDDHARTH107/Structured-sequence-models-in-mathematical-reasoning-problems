    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can, we need to minimize the surface area of the can. The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nA = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere A is the surface area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nWe are given that the height of the can is 4 times its radius, so we can write:\n\nh = 4r\n\nWe also know that the volume of the cylinder is 1 liter, which is equal to 1000 cubic centimeters. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr²h\n\nSubstituting the value of h in terms of r, we get:\n\n1000 = πr²(4r)\n\nDivide both sides by 4π:\n\n250/π = r³\n\nNow, cube root both sides to find the value of r:\n\nr = (250/π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can find the height using the relationship h = 4r:\n\nh = 4(250/π)^(1/3)\n\nNow that we have the dimensions of the can, we can find the surface area:\n\nA = 2π((250/π)^(1/3))² + 2π((250/π)^(1/3))(4(250/π)^(1/3))\n\nA = 2π(250/π)^(2/3) + 8π(250/π)\n\nNow, we can find the cost of the metal to manufacture the can. The metal costs $10 per square meter, and we need to convert the surface area from square centimeters to square meters:\n\nA_meters = A / 10000\n\nCost = 10 * A_meters\n\nCost = 10 * (2π(250/π)^(2/3) + 8π(250/π)) / 10000\n\nThe dimensions of the can that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can are:\n\nRadius: r = (250/π)^(1/3) cm\nHeight: h = 4(250/π)^(1/3) cm\n\nAnd the minimum cost is:\n\nCost = 10 * (2π(250/π)^(2/3) + 8π(250/π)) / 10000 dollars"
