    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways a teacher can choose a group of 5 students from a class of 30, we use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (30 in this case) and k is the number of students to be chosen (5 in this case). The exclamation mark represents the factorial of a number.\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5!(30-5)!)\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5!25!)\n\nNow, we calculate the factorials:\n\n30! = 30 × 29 × 28 × 27 × 26 × 25!\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n25! = 25 × 24 × 23 × ... × 2 × 1\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nC(30, 5) = (30 × 29 × 28 × 27 × 26) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(30, 5) = (30 × 29 × 28 × 27 × 26) / 120\n\nC(30, 5) = 142506\n\nSo, there are 142,506 ways for the teacher to choose a group of 5 students from a class of 30 students to participate in a math competition."
