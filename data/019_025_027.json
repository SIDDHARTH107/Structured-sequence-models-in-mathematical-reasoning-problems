If John scored a B on his math exam, what is the probability that he studied for at least two hours before the exam?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that John studied for at least two hours, and B be the event that John scored a B or higher on his exam. We are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = probability that John studied for at least two hours\nP(A') = probability that John studied for less than two hours\nP(B|A) = probability that John scored a B or higher given that he studied for at least two hours\nP(B|A') = probability that John scored a B or higher given that he studied for less than two hours\n\nWe are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that John studied for at least two hours given that he scored a B or higher.\n\nWe are given:\n\nP(A) = not given\nP(A') = not given\nP(B|A) = 0.80\nP(B|A') = 0.50\n\nWe can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]\n\nHowever, we don't have the values for P(A) and P(A'). We can assume that the probability of a student studying for at least two hours or less than two hours sums up to 1, i.e.,\n\nP(A) + P(A') = 1\n\nWithout the values for P(A) and P(A'), we cannot find the exact probability P(A|B)."
