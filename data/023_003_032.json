    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a numerical problem for a student studying Fourier analysis and using Fourier series to solve partial differential equations:\n\nConsider the following partial differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is a function and $k$ is a constant. Assume the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = 0$ and $u(L,t) = 0$ for some fixed length $L$. \n\nFind the Fourier series representation of $u(x,t)$ by solving the heat equation above using separation of variables. Specifically, assume that:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$ \n\nand then solve for $X(x)$ and $T(t)$ separately. Write your answer in terms of the Fourier series coefficients $a_n$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using separation of variables, we first substitute $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$ into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (X(x)T(t))}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 (X(x)T(t))}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda = k\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) $\\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{k}X(x)$ with boundary conditions $X(0) = 0$ and $X(L) = 0$.\n\n2) $\\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda k T(t)$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for $X(x)$. Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous, we can assume that the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are positive. Thus, we can write $\\lambda = \\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2}$ for some integer $n$. The general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$\n\nNow let's solve the second equation for $T(t)$. The general solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = B_ne^{-\\lambda_n k t}$\n\nNow we can write the solution for $u(x,t)$ as a sum of the product of $X_n(x)$ and $T_n(t)$:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)e^{-\\frac{n^2\\pi^2 k t}{L^2}}$\n\nwhere $a_n = A_nB_n$ are the Fourier series coefficients."
