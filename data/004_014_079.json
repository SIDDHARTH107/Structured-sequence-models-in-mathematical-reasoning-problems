    "message_2": "To find the volume of the water tank, we need to find the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the two hemispheres, then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nThe diameter of the cylinder is 12 m, so the radius is half of that, which is 6 m. The height of the cylinder is given as 10 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV_cylinder = π(6^2)(10) = 360π m^3\n\nNow, let's find the volume of one hemisphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3, and since a hemisphere is half of a sphere, the formula for the volume of a hemisphere is V = (2/3)πr^3.\n\nThe radius of the hemisphere is the same as the radius of the cylinder, which is 6 m. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nV_hemisphere = (2/3)π(6^3) = (2/3)π(216) = 144π m^3\n\nSince there are two hemispheres, the total volume of the two hemispheres is:\n\nV_total_hemispheres = 2 * 144π = 288π m^3\n\nFinally, we add the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the two hemispheres to find the total volume of the water tank:\n\nV_total = V_cylinder + V_total_hemispheres = 360π + 288π = 648π m^3\n\nSo, the volume of the water tank is 648π m^3."
