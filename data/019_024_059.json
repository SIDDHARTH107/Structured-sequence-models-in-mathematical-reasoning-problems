    "message_1": "A math student needs to solve the following abductive logic problem:\n\nSuppose you have a jar with 100 marbles. There are three colors of marbles: blue, green, and yellow. You know that there are at least 20 blue marbles in the jar, and there are more blue marbles than green marbles. You also know that the number of yellow marbles is equal to the number of blue and green marbles combined. How many green marbles are in the jar?",
    "message_2": "Let's use variables to represent the number of marbles of each color:\n\nB = number of blue marbles\nG = number of green marbles\nY = number of yellow marbles\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. B + G + Y = 100 (total number of marbles)\n2. B >= 20 (there are at least 20 blue marbles)\n3. B > G (there are more blue marbles than green marbles)\n4. Y = B + G (the number of yellow marbles is equal to the number of blue and green marbles combined)\n\nNow, we can use this information to solve for the number of green marbles (G).\n\nFrom the 4th piece of information, we can rewrite the 1st equation as:\n\nB + G + (B + G) = 100\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n2B + 2G = 100\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nB + G = 50\n\nSince B > G, the maximum value for G would be when B = 20 (the minimum value for B). In this case, G = 30. However, this contradicts the information that B > G. Therefore, we need to increase the value of B and decrease the value of G while maintaining the equation B + G = 50.\n\nIf we increase B to 21, then G would be 29. This satisfies all the given conditions:\n\n1. B + G + Y = 100 (21 + 29 + 50 = 100)\n2. B >= 20 (21 >= 20)\n3. B > G (21 > 29)\n4. Y = B + G (50 = 21 + 29)\n\nSo, there are 29 green marbles in the jar."
