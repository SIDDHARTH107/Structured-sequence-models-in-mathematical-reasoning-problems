If Player A decides to divide the money equally among all 10 players, how much money will each player receive? If Player A decides to keep 90 units of money for themselves and only give 10 units to the other players, how much will each of the other players receive?",
    "message_2": "If Player A decides to divide the money equally among all 10 players, including themselves, each player will receive:\n\n100 units / 10 players = 10 units per player\n\nIf Player A decides to keep 90 units of money for themselves and only give 10 units to the other players, the remaining 9 players will share the 10 units. In this case, each of the other players will receive:\n\n10 units / 9 players â‰ˆ 1.11 units per player"
