    "message_2": "A quadratic residue is an integer that is congruent to a perfect square modulo a given number. In this case, we are asked to find all the quadratic residues modulo 13.\n\nTo find the quadratic residues of 13, we can calculate the squares of the numbers from 0 to 6 (half of 13, rounded down) modulo 13, as the squares of the numbers from 7 to 12 will be congruent to the squares of the numbers from 0 to 6 modulo 13.\n\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 13)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 13)\n3² ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n4² ≡ 16 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n5² ≡ 25 ≡ 12 (mod 13)\n6² ≡ 36 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues of 13 are {0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12}."
