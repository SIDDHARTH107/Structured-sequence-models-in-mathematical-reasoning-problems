    "message_2": "To find the smallest consecutive pair of primes with a gap of 25, we can start by checking prime numbers and their gaps. We know that the first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, and so on.\n\nWe can see that the gap between 2 and 3 is 1, between 3 and 5 is 2, between 5 and 7 is 2, and so on. We are looking for a gap of 25.\n\nBy checking the gaps between consecutive prime numbers, we find that the smallest consecutive pair of primes with a gap of 25 is 89 and 114. However, 114 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 2 and 57.\n\nWe need to continue searching for the smallest consecutive pair of primes with a gap of 25. After further checking, we find that the smallest consecutive pair of primes with a gap of 25 is 251 and 277. The gap between these two prime numbers is 277 - 251 = 25."
