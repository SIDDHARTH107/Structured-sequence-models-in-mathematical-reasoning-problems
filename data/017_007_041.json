    "message_2": "To show that G must be isomorphic either to the cyclic group C6 or to the dihedral group D3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of an element in a group divides the order of the group.\n2. A group of prime order is cyclic.\n3. A group with a unique element of order 2 is abelian.\n\nSince G has order 6, by the first fact, the possible orders of its elements are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Let's analyze the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 6.\nIf G has an element of order 6, say g, then G = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is a cyclic group generated by g, and G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 6.\nIn this case, G must have elements of orders 2 and 3, since the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3. Then, G contains the elements {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2}.\n\nNow, we claim that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3. Recall that D3 is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle, and it has the following presentation: D3 = {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}, where r is a rotation by 120 degrees and s is a reflection. The relations in D3 are r^3 = e, s^2 = e, and sr = r^2s.\n\nWe can define an isomorphism φ: G → D3 as follows:\nφ(e) = e\nφ(a) = s\nφ(b) = r\nφ(b^2) = r^2\nφ(ab) = sr\nφ(ab^2) = sr^2\n\nIt's easy to verify that φ is a homomorphism, and since it is bijective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic either to the cyclic group C6 or to the dihedral group D3. We found the isomorphisms in each case: the identity map for G isomorphic to C6, and the map φ defined above for G isomorphic to D3."
