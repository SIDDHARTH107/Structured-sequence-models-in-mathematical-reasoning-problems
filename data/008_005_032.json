    "message_2": "First, we will solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods. We can represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3  1 | 12\n| 1 -2  4 | -6\n| 3  1 -2 |  8\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -6\n| 2  3  1 | 12\n| 3  1 -2 |  8\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and replace Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n|  1 -2  4 |  -6\n|  0  7 -7 |  24\n|  0  7 -14|  26\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by 7:\n\n| 1 -2  4 |  -6\n| 0  1 -1 |   3\n| 0  7 -14|  26\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with (-7 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n| 1 -2  4 |  -6\n| 0  1 -1 |   3\n| 0  0  7 |   5\n\n5. Divide Row 3 by 7:\n\n| 1 -2  4 |  -6\n| 0  1 -1 |   3\n| 0  0  1 | 5/7\n\nNow, we will perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. z = 5/7\n2. y = 3 + z = 3 + 5/7 = 26/7\n3. x = -6 - 4z + 2y = -6 - 4(5/7) + 2(26/7) = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 26/7, and z = 5/7.\n\nNow, let's find the value of the unknown constant k such that the system of equations becomes:\n\n2x + 3y + z = 12\n\nx - 2y + 4z = -6\n\n3x + y - 2z = k\n\nWe can substitute the values of x, y, and z that we found earlier into the third equation:\n\n3(3) + (26/7) - 2(5/7) = k\n9 + 26/7 - 10/7 = k\nk = 9 + 16/7\nk = 63/7 + 16/7\nk = 79/7\n\nSo, the value of the unknown constant k is 79/7."
