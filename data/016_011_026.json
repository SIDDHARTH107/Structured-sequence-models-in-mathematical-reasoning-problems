    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal that is created by iteratively replacing each line segment with a pattern of smaller line segments. In each iteration, the length of the line segments is divided by 3, and the number of line segments is multiplied by 5.\n\nLet's calculate the total length of all the line segments in the fractal after 4 iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nLength of each segment: 1/3\nNumber of segments: 5\nTotal length: (1/3) * 5 = 5/3\n\nIteration 2:\nLength of each segment: (1/3) / 3 = 1/9\nNumber of segments: 5 * 5 = 25\nTotal length: (1/9) * 25 = 25/9\n\nIteration 3:\nLength of each segment: (1/9) / 3 = 1/27\nNumber of segments: 25 * 5 = 125\nTotal length: (1/27) * 125 = 125/27\n\nIteration 4:\nLength of each segment: (1/27) / 3 = 1/81\nNumber of segments: 125 * 5 = 625\nTotal length: (1/81) * 625 = 625/81\n\nNow, let's sum the total lengths from all 4 iterations:\n\nTotal length = (5/3) + (25/9) + (125/27) + (625/81)\n\nTo sum these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 9, 27, and 81. The LCM is 81.\n\nTotal length = (5 * 27/81) + (25 * 9/81) + (125 * 3/81) + (625/81)\nTotal length = (135/81) + (225/81) + (375/81) + (625/81)\nTotal length = (135 + 225 + 375 + 625) / 81\nTotal length = 1360/81\n\nSo, the total length of all the line segments in the Vicsek fractal after 4 iterations is 1360/81 units."
