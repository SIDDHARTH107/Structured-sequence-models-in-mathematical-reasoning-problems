    "message_2": "First, we will show that H and K are normal subgroups of G. Since the order of G is 30, we have that |G| = 2 * 3 * 5. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) divides 6 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which we denote by H. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups divides 10 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are 1 or 10. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal in G. If there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, then there are 20 elements of order 3 in G, leaving only 9 elements not of order 3. Since H has 4 elements of order 5, there are only 5 elements left. But G has a subgroup of order 2 by Cauchy's theorem, so there must be an element of order 2. This means there are only 4 elements left, which is not enough to form another Sylow 5-subgroup. Thus, there must be only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which we denote by K, and it must be normal in G.\n\nNow, we have that H and K are normal subgroups of G, and since their orders are relatively prime (5 and 3), we have that their intersection is the identity element. Therefore, by the internal direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, denoted by H x K.\n\nSince H is a group of order 5 and K is a group of order 3, both H and K are cyclic (as 5 and 3 are prime). Let h be a generator of H and k be a generator of K. Then, the elements of G can be written as {h^i * k^j | 0 ≤ i < 5, 0 ≤ j < 3}.\n\nNow, we consider the commutator [h, k] = h^(-1) * k^(-1) * h * k. If [h, k] = e (the identity element), then G is abelian and isomorphic to the cyclic group C30. If [h, k] ≠ e, then G is non-abelian. In this case, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. [h, k] = h^a * k^b for some a and b such that 0 < a < 5 and 0 < b < 3. In this case, G is a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\n2. [h, k] = h^a for some a such that 0 < a < 5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
