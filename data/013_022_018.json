    "message_1": "In the Dictator Game, two players are given a pool of 10 tokens. Player 1 is given the opportunity to split the tokens between themselves and player 2 as they please. Player 2 has no decision-making power and must accept the allocation given by player 1. If player 2 accepts the allocation, both players get to keep their tokens. However, if player 2 rejects the allocation, both players lose all their tokens. \n\nAssuming player 1 values their own tokens twice as much as player 2's tokens, what is the maximum amount of tokens that player 1 can allocate to player 2 without risking rejection and losing all tokens?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of tokens allocated to player 1, and y be the number of tokens allocated to player 2. Since there are 10 tokens in total, we have x + y = 10.\n\nPlayer 1 values their own tokens twice as much as player 2's tokens. Therefore, player 1's utility function can be represented as U1 = 2x + y.\n\nPlayer 2 will reject the allocation if they believe they would be better off with no tokens. Therefore, player 2's utility function can be represented as U2 = y.\n\nPlayer 1 wants to maximize their utility while ensuring player 2 does not reject the allocation. To do this, player 1 must allocate tokens to player 2 such that player 2's utility is greater than or equal to zero (U2 ≥ 0).\n\nSince U2 = y, we have y ≥ 0.\n\nNow, player 1 wants to maximize their utility function U1 = 2x + y, subject to the constraint y ≥ 0 and x + y = 10.\n\nTo find the maximum value of U1, we can substitute the constraint x + y = 10 into the utility function:\n\nU1 = 2(10 - y) + y = 20 - y.\n\nSince player 1 wants to maximize U1, they will minimize y. However, they must also ensure that player 2 does not reject the allocation, so y must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of y that player 1 can allocate to player 2 without risking rejection is y = 0. In this case, player 1 would allocate all 10 tokens to themselves and none to player 2. However, this scenario assumes that player 2 is indifferent between accepting and rejecting the allocation. To ensure that player 2 does not reject the allocation, player 1 should allocate at least 1 token to player 2.\n\nSo, the maximum amount of tokens that player 1 can allocate to player 2 without risking rejection and losing all tokens is 1."
