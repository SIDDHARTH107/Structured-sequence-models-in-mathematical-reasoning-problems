    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the two radii.\n\nThe formula for the arc length (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nFor this problem, we have a radius of 5 cm and a central angle of 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2π(5)\nL = (1/6) × 10π\nL = 10π/6\nL = 5π/3 cm\n\nNow, we add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter = (5π/3) + 2(5)\nPerimeter = (5π/3) + 10\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is approximately (5π/3) + 10 cm."
