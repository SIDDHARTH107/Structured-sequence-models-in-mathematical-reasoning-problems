    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 over the field F_19, we need to check all possible combinations of x and y values in the field F_19 and count the number of valid points that satisfy the equation.\n\nThe field F_19 has 19 elements: {0, 1, 2, ..., 18}. We will iterate through all possible x values and calculate the corresponding y^2 values. Then, we will check if there exists a y value in F_19 such that the calculated y^2 value is a square in F_19.\n\nLet's start iterating through the x values and calculate the corresponding y^2 values:\n\nx = 0: y^2 = 0^3 + 7*0 + 10 = 10\nx = 1: y^2 = 1^3 + 7*1 + 10 = 18\nx = 2: y^2 = 2^3 + 7*2 + 10 = 8\nx = 3: y^2 = 3^3 + 7*3 + 10 = 9\nx = 4: y^2 = 4^3 + 7*4 + 10 = 6\nx = 5: y^2 = 5^3 + 7*5 + 10 = 17\nx = 6: y^2 = 6^3 + 7*6 + 10 = 14\nx = 7: y^2 = 7^3 + 7*7 + 10 = 11\nx = 8: y^2 = 8^3 + 7*8 + 10 = 16\nx = 9: y^2 = 9^3 + 7*9 + 10 = 7\nx = 10: y^2 = 10^3 + 7*10 + 10 = 4\nx = 11: y^2 = 11^3 + 7*11 + 10 = 1\nx = 12: y^2 = 12^3 + 7*12 + 10 = 0\nx = 13: y^2 = 13^3 + 7*13 + 10 = 3\nx = 14: y^2 = 14^3 + 7*14 + 10 = 2\nx = 15: y^2 = 15^3 + 7*15 + 10 = 5\nx = 16: y^2 = 16^3 + 7*16 + 10 = 12\nx = 17: y^2 = 17^3 + 7*17 + 10 = 15\nx = 18: y^2 = 18^3 + 7*18 + 10 = 13\n\nNow, let's count the number of valid points for each x value:\n\nx = 0: 1 valid point (y = 7)\nx = 1: 2 valid points (y = 6, 13)\nx = 2: 2 valid points (y = 3, 16)\nx = 3: 2 valid points (y = 5, 14)\nx = 4: 2 valid points (y = 9, 10)\nx = 5: 2 valid points (y = 4, 15)\nx = 6: 2 valid points (y = 8, 11)\nx = 7: 2 valid points (y = 2, 17)\nx = 8: 2 valid points (y = 4, 15)\nx = 9: 2 valid points (y = 11, 8)\nx = 10: 2 valid points (y = 2, 17)\nx = 11: 2 valid points (y = 1, 18)\nx = 12: 1 valid point (y = 0)\nx = 13: 2 valid points (y = 7, 12)\nx = 14: 2 valid points (y = 5, 14)\nx = 15: 2 valid points (y = 9, 10)\nx = 16: 2 valid points (y = 3, 16)\nx = 17: 2 valid points (y = 6, 13)\nx = 18: 2 valid points (y = 1, 18)\n\nAdding up the valid points for each x value, we get a total of 1 + 2*17 + 1 = 36 points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 over the field F_19."
