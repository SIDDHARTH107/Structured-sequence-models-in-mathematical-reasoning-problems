    "message_2": "To prove that H is a normal subgroup of G, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a subgroup divides the order of the group (Lagrange's Theorem).\n2. A subgroup of index 2 is always normal.\n3. If a group has a unique subgroup of a certain order, that subgroup is normal.\n\nFirst, we know that the order of G is 27 and the order of H is 9. By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since 9 divides 27, H is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's find the index of H in G. The index of a subgroup H in a group G is defined as the number of distinct left (or right) cosets of H in G. In this case, the index of H in G is |G|/|H| = 27/9 = 3.\n\nSince the index of H in G is 3, there are three distinct left cosets of H in G. Let's denote these cosets as Ha, Hb, and Hc, where a, b, and c are elements of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of two cosets, say Ha and Hb. Since the index of H in G is 3, the product HaHb must be equal to one of the cosets Ha, Hb, or Hc. If HaHb = Ha or HaHb = Hb, then b or a would be in H, which contradicts the fact that a and b are not in H (otherwise, the cosets would not be distinct). Therefore, HaHb = Hc.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of HaHb with the inverse of Ha, which is Ha^(-1). We have:\n\nHaHbHa^(-1) = HcHa^(-1)\n\nSince HaHb = Hc, we can write this as:\n\nHa(HbHa^(-1)) = Hc\n\nNow, let x be an element in HbHa^(-1). Then x = hb(a^(-1)) for some h ∈ H. Since H is a subgroup, h(a^(-1)) ∈ H, and thus x ∈ H. This means that HbHa^(-1) is a subset of H.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that Ha^(-1)Hc is a subset of H. Therefore, HaHbHa^(-1) = HcHa^(-1) is a subset of H.\n\nNow, let's consider the product HaHbHa^(-1) with the inverse of Hc, which is Hc^(-1). We have:\n\nHaHbHa^(-1)Hc^(-1) = HcHa^(-1)Hc^(-1)\n\nSince HaHbHa^(-1) = HcHa^(-1) is a subset of H, and H is closed under multiplication and inverses, the product HaHbHa^(-1)Hc^(-1) is also a subset of H.\n\nFinally, let's consider the product HaHb with the inverse of HaHb, which is (HaHb)^(-1). We have:\n\nHaHb(HaHb)^(-1) = H\n\nSince HaHb = Hc, we can write this as:\n\nHc(Hc)^(-1) = H\n\nSince H is closed under multiplication and inverses, the product Hc(Hc)^(-1) is equal to H.\n\nThus, we have shown that HaHbHa^(-1) is a subset of H, and HaHb(HaHb)^(-1) is equal to H. This means that H is a normal subgroup of G, as required."
