    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nwhere f1(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 3 and f2(x, y) = xy - 1.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = -2y\n∂f2/∂x = y\n∂f2/∂y = x\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = |  2x  -2y |\n          |   y   x  |\n\nNow we can apply Newton's method using the following formula:\n\n(x_new, y_new) = (x_old, y_old) - J(x_old, y_old)^(-1) * F(x_old, y_old)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the vector of the functions [f1(x, y), f2(x, y)].\n\nWe start with the initial guess (x0, y0) = (1.5, 0.5) and perform three iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nJ(1.5, 0.5) = |  3  -1 |\n              | 0.5  1.5 |\n\nF(1.5, 0.5) = [1.5^2 - 0.5^2 - 3, 1.5*0.5 - 1] = [0.5, -0.25]\n\nTo find J(1.5, 0.5)^(-1) * F(1.5, 0.5), we first compute the inverse of J(1.5, 0.5):\n\nJ(1.5, 0.5)^(-1) = 1/(3*1.5 - (-1)*0.5) * |  1.5  1 |\n                                           | -0.5  3 |\n\nJ(1.5, 0.5)^(-1) = 1/4.5 * |  1.5  1 |\n                           | -0.5  3 |\n\nJ(1.5, 0.5)^(-1) = |  1/3  2/9  |\n                   | -1/9  2/3  |\n\nNow, we can compute J(1.5, 0.5)^(-1) * F(1.5, 0.5):\n\nJ(1.5, 0.5)^(-1) * F(1.5, 0.5) = |  1/3  2/9  | * |  0.5  |\n                                 | -1/9  2/3  |   | -0.25 |\n\nJ(1.5, 0.5)^(-1) * F(1.5, 0.5) = | 1/6 - 1/18 | = | 1/9  |\n                                 |-1/18 + 1/6 |   | 1/9  |\n\nNow, we can update our guess:\n\n(x1, y1) = (1.5, 0.5) - (1/9, 1/9) = (1.389, 0.389)\n\nIteration 2:\nJ(1.389, 0.389) = |  2.778  -0.778 |\n                  |  0.389   1.389 |\n\nF(1.389, 0.389) = [1.389^2 - 0.389^2 - 3, 1.389*0.389 - 1] = [0.021, -0.008]\n\nWe compute J(1.389, 0.389)^(-1) * F(1.389, 0.389) and update our guess:\n\n(x2, y2) = (1.389, 0.389) - (0.006, 0.006) = (1.383, 0.383)\n\nIteration 3:\nJ(1.383, 0.383) = |  2.766  -0.766 |\n                  |  0.383   1.383 |\n\nF(1.383, 0.383) = [1.383^2 - 0.383^2 - 3, 1.383*0.383 - 1] = [0.000, -0.000]\n\nWe compute J(1.383, 0.383)^(-1) * F(1.383, 0.383) and update our guess:\n\n(x3, y3) = (1.383, 0.383) - (0.000, 0.000) = (1.383, 0.383)\n\nAfter three iterations, our approximate solution is (x, y) = (1.383, 0.383), rounded to three decimal places."
