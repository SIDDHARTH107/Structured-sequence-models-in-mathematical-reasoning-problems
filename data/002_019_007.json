    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a cone if the radius of its base is 6 cm and its height is 10 cm? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, and l is the slant height of the cone. First, we need to find the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nl = √(r^2 + h^2)\n\nwhere h is the height of the cone. Plugging in the given values:\n\nl = √(6^2 + 10^2) = √(36 + 100) = √136\n\nNow, we can find the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = π(6)(6 + √136) ≈ 3.14(6)(6 + 11.66) ≈ 3.14(6)(17.66) ≈ 334.93 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 334.93 cm², rounded to the nearest hundredth."
