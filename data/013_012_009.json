    "message_1": "A company is in Stackelberg competition with another company in the market. Its marginal cost of production is given by 5. At a market demand of 100 units, the other firm is the leader and produces output as per its profit maximization of quantity 60. Determine the output level of the company and calculate its profit. Also, find the total market quantity and market price.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the market demand curve, the reaction function of the follower firm (our company), and then determine the output level and profit of our company.\n\n1. Market demand curve:\nWe know that the total market quantity is 100 units when the other firm (leader) produces 60 units. Let P be the market price and Q be the total market quantity. The market demand curve can be represented as P = A - BQ, where A and B are constants. We need to find the values of A and B.\n\nWhen Q = 100, the leader firm produces 60 units, so the follower firm (our company) produces 40 units. The market price is the same for both firms, so we can write the demand curve for the leader firm as P = A - B(60), and for the follower firm as P = A - B(40).\n\nSince both firms face the same market price, we can equate the two demand curves:\n\nA - B(60) = A - B(40)\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = (A - A) / (60 - 40) = 0 / 20 = 0\n\nSince B = 0, the market demand curve is P = A.\n\n2. Reaction function of the follower firm (our company):\nThe follower firm's profit maximization problem can be written as:\n\nmax π = P * q - C(q)\n\nwhere π is the profit, q is the output level of the follower firm, and C(q) is the cost function. We know that the marginal cost of production for the follower firm is 5, so the cost function can be written as C(q) = 5q.\n\nSubstituting the market demand curve (P = A) and the cost function (C(q) = 5q) into the profit maximization problem, we get:\n\nmax π = A * q - 5q\n\nTaking the first-order derivative with respect to q and setting it equal to 0 to find the optimal output level:\n\ndπ/dq = A - 5 = 0\n\nA = 5\n\nSo, the market demand curve is P = 5.\n\n3. Output level and profit of the follower firm (our company):\nSince the market price is 5, the profit maximization problem for the follower firm becomes:\n\nmax π = 5 * q - 5q\n\nπ = 0\n\nThis means that the follower firm (our company) makes zero profit in the Stackelberg competition. Since the leader firm produces 60 units and the total market quantity is 100 units, the output level of the follower firm (our company) is:\n\nq = 100 - 60 = 40 units\n\n4. Total market quantity and market price:\nThe total market quantity is 100 units, and the market price is 5."
