    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and set B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Calculate the symmetric difference of the two sets, and then find the complement of that result. Finally, find the symmetric difference of the complements of sets A and B. Show that these two values are not equal, therefore proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1, 2}\nB - A = {5, 6}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2} ∪ {5, 6} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference. The complement of a set is the set of elements that are not in the given set. We will assume the universal set U contains all the elements from sets A and B.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {1, 2, 5, 6} = {3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the complements of sets A and B:\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {1, 2, 3, 4} = {5, 6}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complements of sets A and B:\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' - B') ∪ (B' - A')\n\nA' - B' = {5, 6} - {1, 2} = {5, 6}\nB' - A' = {1, 2} - {5, 6} = {1, 2}\n\nA' ∆ B' = {5, 6} ∪ {1, 2} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's compare the complement of the symmetric difference of sets A and B with the symmetric difference of the complements of sets A and B:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {3, 4}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nSince (A ∆ B)' ≠ A' ∆ B', the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
