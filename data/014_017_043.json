    "message_1": "A message has been encrypted using a substitution cipher, where each letter of the original message has been replaced with a different letter. Using frequency analysis, it is determined that the most common letter in the encrypted message is \"Y\", which represents the letter \"E\" in the original message. If the second most common letter is \"X\", which represents the letter \"T\" in the original message, what is the probability that a randomly chosen letter in the encrypted message will represent the letter \"R\" in the original message?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that a randomly chosen letter in the encrypted message will represent the letter \"R\" in the original message, we need to know the frequency of the letter \"R\" in the original message or the frequency of the letter that represents \"R\" in the encrypted message.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough information to determine this probability. We only know the most common letter \"Y\" represents \"E\" and the second most common letter \"X\" represents \"T\". We would need more information about the frequency distribution of the letters in the encrypted message or the original message to calculate the probability for the letter \"R\"."
