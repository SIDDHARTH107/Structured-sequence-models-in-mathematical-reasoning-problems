    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a 3 or higher on a fair six-sided die, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 3, 4, 5, or 6) and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nThere are 4 successful outcomes (3, 4, 5, and 6) and 6 total possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a 3 or higher on the first roll is:\n\n4 successful outcomes / 6 total possible outcomes = 4/6 = 2/3\n\nThe probability of rolling a 3 or higher on the first roll is 2/3 or approximately 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)."
