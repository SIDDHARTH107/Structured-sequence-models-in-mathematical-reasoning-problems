    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral, we will use Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed curve is zero. First, we need to check if the function f(z) = 3z^2 + 2z - 1 is analytic.\n\nA function is analytic if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function f(z) is a polynomial, and polynomials are differentiable everywhere. Therefore, f(z) is analytic.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic and γ is a closed curve, we can apply Cauchy's integral theorem:\n\n∫γ (3z^2 + 2z - 1) dz = 0"
