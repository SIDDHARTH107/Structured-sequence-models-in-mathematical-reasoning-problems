    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total Gaussian curvature of a surface, the total geodesic curvature of its boundary, and its Euler characteristic. The theorem is stated as follows:\n\n∫∫_M K dA + ∫_∂M k_g ds = 2πχ(M)\n\nwhere:\n- K is the Gaussian curvature of the surface M\n- dA is the area element on the surface\n- k_g is the geodesic curvature of the boundary ∂M of the surface\n- ds is the arc length element along the boundary\n- χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of the surface M\n\nIn this problem, we are given the Gaussian curvature K = 2 and the total geodesic curvature ∫_∂M k_g ds = 6π. We can plug these values into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n∫∫_M (2) dA + 6π = 2πχ(M)\n\nTo find the Euler characteristic χ(M), we need to know the area of the surface. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the area. However, we can rewrite the equation in terms of the area A:\n\n2A + 6π = 2πχ(M)\n\nIf we had more information about the surface, such as its topology or area, we could solve for the Euler characteristic χ(M)."
