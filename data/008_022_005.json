    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method with partial pivoting, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 7 |\n| 4  5  6 |15 |\n| 7  8 10 |21 |\n\nStep 1: Find the pivot in the first column (largest absolute value) and swap rows if necessary. In this case, the pivot is already in the correct position (1).\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the pivot:\n\n| 1  2   3 |  7 |\n| 0 -3  -6 |-13 |\n| 0 -6 -11 |-28 |\n\nStep 3: Find the pivot in the second column (largest absolute value) and swap rows if necessary. In this case, we need to swap row 2 and row 3:\n\n| 1  2   3 |  7 |\n| 0 -6 -11 |-28 |\n| 0 -3  -6 |-13 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below the pivot:\n\n| 1  2   3 |  7 |\n| 0 -6 -11 |-28 |\n| 0  0   1 |  3 |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can perform back-substitution:\n\nz = 3\n\n-6y - 11z = -28\n-6y - 11(3) = -28\n-6y - 33 = -28\ny = (28 - 33) / -6\ny = 5 / 6\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 7\nx + 2(5/6) + 3(3) = 7\nx = 7 - 10/3 - 9\nx = (21 - 10 - 27) / 3\nx = -16 / 3\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -16/3\ny = 5/6\nz = 3\n\nNow, let's check if the resulting matrix is ill-conditioned. We can do this by calculating the determinant of the coefficient matrix and checking if it's close to zero.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n\n| 1  2  3 |\n| 4  5  6 |\n| 7  8 10 |\n\nDeterminant = 1(5*10 - 6*8) - 2(4*10 - 6*7) + 3(4*8 - 5*7)\nDeterminant = 1(50 - 48) - 2(40 - 42) + 3(32 - 35)\nDeterminant = 1(2) - 2(-2) + 3(-3)\nDeterminant = 2 + 4 - 9\nDeterminant = -3\n\nSince the determinant is not close to zero, the matrix is not ill-conditioned."
