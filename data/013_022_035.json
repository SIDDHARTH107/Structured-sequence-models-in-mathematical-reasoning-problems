    "message_1": "Suppose Alice and Bob are playing the Dictator Game, where Alice is the dictator and she has $100 to divide between herself and Bob. Alice can choose to give any amount between 0 and 100 to Bob, and she can keep the rest for herself. If Bob accepts the amount given by Alice, then both of them keep the money. If Bob rejects the offer, then neither of them gets to keep the money. \n\nAssuming Bob knows that rejecting the offer means both of them get nothing and that both Alice and Bob are rational, what is the rational amount Alice should offer to Bob to ensure he accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "Since both Alice and Bob are rational, they will both want to maximize their own gains. Bob knows that if he rejects the offer, he will get nothing. Therefore, he will accept any offer that is greater than $0, as it is better than getting nothing. \n\nKnowing this, Alice can offer the smallest amount greater than $0 to Bob, which would be $1. This way, Alice can keep $99 for herself, and Bob will accept the offer since it is better than getting nothing. So, the rational amount Alice should offer to Bob is $1."
