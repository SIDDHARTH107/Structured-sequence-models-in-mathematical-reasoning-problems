    "message_2": "To encrypt a message using RSA encryption, we use the formula:\n\nciphertext = (plaintext^e) % n\n\nIn this case, the plaintext message is 71, e = 17, and n = 323. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nciphertext = (71^17) % 323\n\nCalculating 71^17:\n\n71^17 = 2415919107800001\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when this number is divided by 323:\n\nciphertext = 2415919107800001 % 323 = 93\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext that you will send is 93."
