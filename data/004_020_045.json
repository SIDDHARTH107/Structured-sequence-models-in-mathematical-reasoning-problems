    "message_1": "A 200-pound object is moved horizontally across a table by a force of 50 pounds, where the displacement is 8 feet. Using integration, find the work done by the force.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Displacement × cos(θ)\n\nSince the object is moved horizontally and the force is also applied horizontally, the angle between the force and the displacement is 0 degrees. The cosine of 0 degrees is 1, so the formula becomes:\n\nWork = Force × Displacement\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nForce = 50 pounds\nDisplacement = 8 feet\n\nWork = 50 pounds × 8 feet\n\nWork = 400 foot-pounds\n\nUsing integration, the work done by the force is 400 foot-pounds."
