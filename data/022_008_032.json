    "message_2": "The order of an entire function is a measure of the growth rate of the function as the magnitude of the input variable approaches infinity. In this case, we are given the function f(z) = e^z - 1.\n\nTo find the order of the entire function, we can use the Hadamard's theorem, which states that the order ρ of an entire function can be found using the formula:\n\nρ = lim (sup) (z -> ∞) (log |f(z)| / log |z|)\n\nLet's analyze the function f(z) = e^z - 1:\n\nAs z approaches infinity, the exponential term e^z grows much faster than the constant term -1. Therefore, we can approximate f(z) as e^z for large values of z.\n\nNow, let's find the order ρ:\n\nρ = lim (sup) (z -> ∞) (log |e^z| / log |z|)\n\nSince |e^z| = e^Re(z) (where Re(z) denotes the real part of z), we have:\n\nρ = lim (sup) (z -> ∞) (Re(z) / log |z|)\n\nNow, let's consider the case when z is a large positive real number (i.e., z = x, where x is a large positive real number). In this case, Re(z) = x, and we have:\n\nρ = lim (sup) (x -> ∞) (x / log x)\n\nTo evaluate this limit, we can use L'Hôpital's rule. Differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to x, we get:\n\nρ = lim (sup) (x -> ∞) (1 / (1 / x))\n\nρ = lim (sup) (x -> ∞) x\n\nAs x approaches infinity, the limit also approaches infinity. Therefore, the order of the entire function f(z) = e^z - 1 is infinite."
