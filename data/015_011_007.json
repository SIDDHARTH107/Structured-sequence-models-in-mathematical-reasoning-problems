    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a complex and chaotic system, which means that it is highly sensitive to initial conditions and does not have a simple closed-form solution for the maximum angle displaced by the second pendulum. To determine the maximum angle displaced by the second pendulum, one would need to numerically simulate the system using the equations of motion and the given initial conditions.\n\nHowever, I can provide the equations of motion for a double pendulum system, which can be used to perform the numerical simulation.\n\nLet θ₁ and θ₂ be the angles of the first and second pendulums with respect to the vertical, and let L₁ and L₂ be the lengths of the first and second pendulums, respectively. Also, let m₁ and m₂ be the masses of the first and second pendulums, respectively, and g be the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe equations of motion for a double pendulum system can be written as:\n\n(1) (m₁ + m₂) * L₁ * θ₁'' + m₂ * L₂ * θ₂'' * cos(θ₁ - θ₂) + m₂ * L₂ * (θ₂')² * sin(θ₁ - θ₂) + g * (m₁ + m₂) * sin(θ₁) = 0\n\n(2) L₂ * θ₂'' + L₁ * θ₁'' * cos(θ₁ - θ₂) - L₁ * (θ₁')² * sin(θ₁ - θ₂) + g * sin(θ₂) = 0\n\nHere, θ₁'' and θ₂'' represent the second derivatives of θ₁ and θ₂ with respect to time (i.e., the angular accelerations), and θ₁' and θ₂' represent the first derivatives of θ₁ and θ₂ with respect to time (i.e., the angular velocities).\n\nTo find the maximum angle displaced by the second pendulum, you would need to numerically solve these equations of motion using the given initial conditions (θ₁(0) = 20°, θ₂(0) = 10°, θ₁'(0) = 0, and θ₂'(0) = 0) and then analyze the resulting time series of θ₂ to find its maximum value."
