A researcher studied a sample of 100 patients and discovered that the drug was successful in curing the disease for 22 patients. \n\nWhat is the probability that the drug will cure the disease for 30 or more patients out of a new sample of 100 patients?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 30% or 0.3)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, we want to find the probability of 30 or more successes)\n\nWe want to find the probability of 30 or more successes, so we need to calculate the cumulative probability for k = 30 to 100:\n\nP(X >= 30) = 1 - P(X < 30) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 29\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each k and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 30) = 1 - Σ [C(100, k) * 0.3^k * 0.7^(100-k)] for k = 0 to 29\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 30) ≈ 1 - 0.9474 = 0.0526\n\nSo, the probability that the drug will cure the disease for 30 or more patients out of a new sample of 100 patients is approximately 5.26%."
