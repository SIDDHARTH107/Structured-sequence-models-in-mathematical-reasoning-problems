They collect the following data: \n\n- For employees who perform well, the average age is 35 and the average salary is $50,000.\n- For employees who perform poorly, the average age is 50 and the average salary is $30,000.\n\nUsing discriminant analysis, determine the linear equation that separates the well-performing employees from the poorly performing employees.",
    "message_2": "To perform a discriminant analysis, we need to find the linear equation that best separates the two groups of employees. We can represent the well-performing employees with the point (35, 50,000) and the poorly performing employees with the point (50, 30,000). Let's denote these points as A (35, 50,000) and B (50, 30,000).\n\nFirst, we need to find the midpoint between these two points. The midpoint formula is:\n\nMidpoint M = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n\nM = ((35 + 50)/2, (50,000 + 30,000)/2)\nM = (85/2, 80,000/2)\nM = (42.5, 40,000)\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the line perpendicular to the line connecting points A and B. The slope formula is:\n\nSlope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nSlope_AB = (30,000 - 50,000) / (50 - 35)\nSlope_AB = (-20,000) / 15\nSlope_AB = -4/3\n\nSince we want the slope of the line perpendicular to AB, we'll use the negative reciprocal:\n\nSlope_perpendicular = 3/4\n\nNow, we have the slope and a point (M) on the line. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\ny - 40,000 = (3/4)(x - 42.5)\n\nTo make it easier to work with, let's multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n4(y - 40,000) = 3(x - 42.5)\n4y - 160,000 = 3x - 127.5\n\nNow, let's put the equation in the standard form (Ax + By = C):\n\n3x - 4y = -160,000 + 127.5\n3x - 4y = -159,872.5\n\nSo, the linear equation that separates the well-performing employees from the poorly performing employees is:\n\n3x - 4y = -159,872.5"
