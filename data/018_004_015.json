    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted as A', will contain all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nLet's assume that the universal set U contains all the integers from 1 to 10. Then, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now, we can find the complement of A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of U and A, we can see that the elements 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 are not in A. Therefore, the complement of A is:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's prove that this complement set is unique. Suppose there exists another set B such that B is also the complement of A. Then, by definition, B must also contain all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nSince A and B are both complements of A, they must have the same elements. Therefore, B must also contain the elements 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10. Since A' and B have the same elements, they are equal:\n\nA' = B\n\nThus, the complement of A is unique, and it is the set A' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}."
