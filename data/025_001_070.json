    "message_1": "Consider the two algebraic curves in the plane given by the equations:\n\nC1: x² + y² = 1\n\nC2: x² - 2x + y² - 2y = 0\n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, determine the number of intersection points between these two curves.",
    "message_2": "To apply Bezout's theorem, we first need to rewrite the given equations as homogeneous polynomials. We can do this by introducing a new variable z and homogenizing the equations:\n\nC1: x² + y² - z² = 0\nC2: x² - 2xz + y² - 2yz = 0\n\nNow we can determine the degrees of these two curves. The degree of a curve is the highest total degree of its terms. In this case, both C1 and C2 have a degree of 2.\n\nBezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points between two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are counted with their multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, the product of the degrees is 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 intersection points between the two curves, counted with their multiplicities."
