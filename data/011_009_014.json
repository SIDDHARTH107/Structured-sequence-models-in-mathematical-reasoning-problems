    "message_1": "A company has 8 distinct colors of t-shirts and wants to create a collection with at least one t-shirt of each color. In how many ways can they choose the t-shirts for the collection?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the number of t-shirts of each color that can be chosen for the collection. Since there must be at least one t-shirt of each color, we can represent the number of t-shirts of each color as follows:\n\nColor 1: 1, 2, 3, ...\nColor 2: 1, 2, 3, ...\nColor 3: 1, 2, 3, ...\n...\nColor 8: 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we can use the multiplication principle to find the total number of ways to choose the t-shirts for the collection. The multiplication principle states that if there are n ways to do one thing and m ways to do another, then there are n * m ways to do both.\n\nFor each color, there are infinite choices (1, 2, 3, ...), so we cannot directly apply the multiplication principle here. However, we can use the concept of geometric series to find the total number of ways.\n\nLet's assume that for each color, there is a maximum limit of t-shirts that can be chosen, say k. Then, for each color, there are k choices (1, 2, 3, ..., k). Now, we can apply the multiplication principle:\n\nTotal number of ways = k * k * k * ... * k (8 times) = k^8\n\nAs k approaches infinity, the total number of ways also approaches infinity. Therefore, there are infinite ways to choose the t-shirts for the collection with at least one t-shirt of each color."
