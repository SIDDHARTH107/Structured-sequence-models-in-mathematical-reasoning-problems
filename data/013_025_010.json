    "message_1": "Let's say two travelers were separated and offered the deal that whoever can name the amount between 1 and 100, inclusive, that is closest to half the average of the named amounts will receive a prize of $100. If both travelers are rational and understand the principle of game theory, what number should each traveler choose?",
    "message_2": "This problem is a classic example of game theory, specifically a two-player game. Let's call the two travelers Player A and Player B. Both players are trying to choose a number between 1 and 100, inclusive, that is closest to half the average of the named amounts.\n\nLet x be the number chosen by Player A and y be the number chosen by Player B. The average of the named amounts is (x + y) / 2, and half of the average is (x + y) / 4.\n\nBoth players are rational and understand game theory, so they will try to minimize the difference between their chosen number and half the average of the named amounts. In other words, they want to minimize the absolute value of the difference between their chosen number and (x + y) / 4.\n\nPlayer A wants to minimize |x - (x + y) / 4|, and Player B wants to minimize |y - (x + y) / 4|.\n\nSince both players are rational, they will assume that the other player is also trying to minimize their difference. Therefore, Player A will assume that Player B will choose a number y such that |y - (x + y) / 4| is minimized, and Player B will assume that Player A will choose a number x such that |x - (x + y) / 4| is minimized.\n\nIf both players choose the same number, then the difference between their chosen number and half the average of the named amounts will be zero, which is the minimum possible difference. So, both players will choose the same number.\n\nLet's call this number z. Then, we have:\n\nz = (z + z) / 4\n4z = 2z\n2z = 0\nz = 0\n\nHowever, z must be between 1 and 100, inclusive. So, the closest integer value to 0 within the given range is 1.\n\nTherefore, both travelers should choose the number 1 to minimize the difference between their chosen number and half the average of the named amounts."
