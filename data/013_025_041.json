    "message_1": "Consider two travelers, A and B, who lose their identical bags on a flight. The bags each contain $100 bills, but there is no receipt or other proof of ownership. The airline can only reimburse passengers for losses up to $50. They cannot communicate with each other, and must decide independently before contacting the airline how much to claim in compensation. If both claim the full $50, the airline will regard it as a coincidence and pay up; but if one traveler claims less than $50, they will reimburse that person for the full amount claimed and punish the other one by awarding them nothing. What should each traveler claim? What is the outcome?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be analyzed using game theory, specifically the concept of Nash equilibrium. In this situation, there are two players (travelers A and B) and each has two strategies: claim $50 or claim less than $50.\n\nLet's consider the possible outcomes:\n\n1. Both travelers claim $50: The airline regards it as a coincidence and pays each traveler $50. The outcome is ($50, $50).\n\n2. Traveler A claims $50 and traveler B claims less than $50: The airline reimburses traveler B for the full amount claimed and punishes traveler A by awarding them nothing. The outcome is ($0, x), where x is the amount claimed by traveler B.\n\n3. Traveler A claims less than $50 and traveler B claims $50: The airline reimburses traveler A for the full amount claimed and punishes traveler B by awarding them nothing. The outcome is (x, $0), where x is the amount claimed by traveler A.\n\n4. Both travelers claim less than $50: The airline reimburses each traveler for the full amount claimed. The outcome is (x, y), where x and y are the amounts claimed by travelers A and B, respectively.\n\nIn this situation, the best strategy for each traveler is to claim $50. This is because if one traveler claims less than $50, they risk getting nothing if the other traveler also claims less than $50. On the other hand, if both travelers claim $50, they are guaranteed to receive $50 each.\n\nThus, the Nash equilibrium in this game is for both travelers to claim $50, resulting in the outcome ($50, $50)."
