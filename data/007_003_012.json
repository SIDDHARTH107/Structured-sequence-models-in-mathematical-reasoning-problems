    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 3125 is divided by 37 using modular arithmetic principles, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the given number (3125) in a form that is easier to work with modulo 37. Since 3125 = 5^5, we can rewrite the problem as finding the remainder of 5^5 when divided by 37.\n\n2. Calculate the powers of 5 modulo 37:\n   - 5^1 ≡ 5 (mod 37)\n   - 5^2 ≡ 25 (mod 37)\n   - 5^3 ≡ 5 * 25 ≡ 125 ≡ 14 (mod 37) (since 125 - 3 * 37 = 14)\n   - 5^4 ≡ 14 * 5 ≡ 70 ≡ 33 (mod 37) (since 70 - 37 = 33)\n   - 5^5 ≡ 33 * 5 ≡ 165 ≡ 17 (mod 37) (since 165 - 4 * 37 = 17)\n\n3. The remainder when 3125 is divided by 37 is 17."
