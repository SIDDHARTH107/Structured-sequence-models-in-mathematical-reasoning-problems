    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x) * (4x - 1) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x^2 + 3x\nv(x) = 4x - 1\n\nNext, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(u)/dx = d(x^2 + 3x)/dx = 2x + 3\nv'(x) = d(v)/dx = d(4x - 1)/dx = 4\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nd(uv)/dx = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSo, for our functions, we have:\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 3)(4x - 1) + (x^2 + 3x)(4)\n\nNow, we can expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 3)(4x - 1) + 4(x^2 + 3x)\n      = 8x^2 - 2x + 12x - 3 + 4x^2 + 12x\n      = 8x^2 + 10x - 3 + 4x^2 + 12x\n      = 12x^2 + 22x - 3\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x) * (4x - 1) is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 + 22x - 3"
