    "message_1": "In a school, there are 10 students who want to form a committee consisting of 3 representatives from each grade level: 9th grade, 10th grade, and 11th grade. In how many ways can they choose the committee members?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nSince there are 10 students and 3 representatives from each grade level, we can assume that there are at least 3 students in each grade level. Let's denote the number of students in each grade level as follows:\n\n- 9th grade: n1 students\n- 10th grade: n2 students\n- 11th grade: n3 students\n\nWe know that n1 + n2 + n3 = 10.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 representatives from each grade level. For each grade level, we will use the combination formula:\n\n- 9th grade: C(n1, 3) = n1! / (3!(n1-3)!)\n- 10th grade: C(n2, 3) = n2! / (3!(n2-3)!)\n- 11th grade: C(n3, 3) = n3! / (3!(n3-3)!)\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose the committee members, we will multiply the number of ways for each grade level:\n\nTotal ways = C(n1, 3) * C(n2, 3) * C(n3, 3)\n\nHowever, we do not have the exact values for n1, n2, and n3. Since the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact distribution of students among the grade levels, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer to this question."
