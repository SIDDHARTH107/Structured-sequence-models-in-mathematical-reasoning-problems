    "message_1": "In Playfair cipher, the English alphabet is arranged in a 5x5 matrix. Suppose we want to encrypt the word \"MATH\" using a Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\". \n\nWhat is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the word \"MATH\" using a Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\", we first need to create the 5x5 matrix using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: CRYPTO -> CRYPT\n2. Fill the 5x5 matrix with the unique key letters and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is usually combined with I in Playfair cipher):\n\n   C  R  Y  P  T\n   O  A  B  D  E\n   F  G  H  I  K\n   L  M  N  S  U\n   V  W  X  Z  Q\n\n3. Break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters): MA TH\n4. Encrypt each digraph using the matrix:\n   - MA: M is in row 4, column 2; A is in row 2, column 2. They are in the same column, so we replace them with the letters below them (wrap around if needed). Encrypted digraph: LN\n   - TH: T is in row 1, column 5; H is in row 3, column 3. They form a rectangle, so we replace them with the letters in the opposite corners. Encrypted digraph: YD\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message: LNYD"
