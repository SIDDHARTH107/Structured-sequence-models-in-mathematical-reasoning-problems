    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two products P1 and P2. The company has a daily production capacity of 150 units, and each unit of P1 requires 3 hours of production time and each unit of P2 requires 5 hours of production time. The company earns a profit of $10 for each unit of P1 and $15 for each unit of P2. What is the maximum profit that the company can earn in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of P1 produced and y be the number of units of P2 produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 150 (total production capacity)\n2. 3x + 5y ≤ 450 (total production time, assuming 150 hours available in a day)\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit, which is given by the equation:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region. Then, we can check the vertices of the feasible region to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 150\n   y ≤ 150 - x\n\n2. 3x + 5y ≤ 450\n   y ≤ (450 - 3x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices (0, 0), (0, 90), (50, 60), and (150, 0).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 90) = 10(0) + 15(90) = $1350\n3. Profit at (50, 60) = 10(50) + 15(60) = $1400\n4. Profit at (150, 0) = 10(150) + 15(0) = $1500\n\nThe maximum profit is $1500, which occurs when the company produces 150 units of P1 and 0 units of P2."
