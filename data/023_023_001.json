Determine the current i(t) flowing through the resistor using the Fourier transform method. \n\n![network diagram](https://i.imgur.com/xNzLfb1.png)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the Fourier transform of the voltage source V(t) and then use Ohm's law to find the current i(t) flowing through the resistor.\n\n1. Find the Fourier transform of V(t):\n\nV(t) = 4cos(1000t)\n\nThe Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF{cos(at)} = π[δ(ω - a) + δ(ω + a)]\n\nwhere F denotes the Fourier transform, a is the frequency of the cosine function, ω is the angular frequency, and δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nIn our case, a = 1000. So, the Fourier transform of V(t) is:\n\nV(ω) = 2π[δ(ω - 1000) + δ(ω + 1000)]\n\n2. Use Ohm's law to find the current i(t):\n\nOhm's law states that V = RI, where V is the voltage, R is the resistance, and I is the current. In the frequency domain, this becomes:\n\nI(ω) = V(ω) / R\n\nWe know that V(ω) = 2π[δ(ω - 1000) + δ(ω + 1000)] and R = 3 ohms. So,\n\nI(ω) = (2π/3)[δ(ω - 1000) + δ(ω + 1000)]\n\n3. Find the inverse Fourier transform of I(ω) to get i(t):\n\nThe inverse Fourier transform of a Dirac delta function is given by:\n\nF⁻¹{δ(ω - a)} = (1/2π) * e^(jat)\n\nSo, the inverse Fourier transform of I(ω) is:\n\ni(t) = (1/3)[2cos(1000t) + 2cos(-1000t)]\n\nSince cos(-x) = cos(x), we can simplify this expression to:\n\ni(t) = (2/3)cos(1000t)\n\nSo, the current i(t) flowing through the resistor is:\n\ni(t) = (2/3)cos(1000t) A"
