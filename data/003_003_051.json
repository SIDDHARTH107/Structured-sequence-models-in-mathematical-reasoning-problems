    "message_2": "To find the value of sin(150°), we can use the sum of angles formula for sine, which states that sin(A + B) = sin(A)cos(B) + cos(A)sin(B). We can break down 150° into the sum of two known angles: 90° and 60°. So, we have:\n\nsin(150°) = sin(90° + 60°) = sin(90°)cos(60°) + cos(90°)sin(60°)\n\nWe know that sin(90°) = 1, cos(90°) = 0, sin(60°) = √3/2, and cos(60°) = 1/2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nsin(150°) = (1)(1/2) + (0)(√3/2) = 1/2 + 0 = 1/2\n\nSo, sin(150°) = 1/2."
