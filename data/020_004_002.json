    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has constraints on the total resources it can use to produce these products. The resources can be allocated to the products in any proportion. The profit of Product A is $8 per unit and the profit of Product B is $10 per unit. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should it produce given the following constraints?\n\n- The company has a maximum of 500 units of resource X.\n- The company has a maximum of 700 units of resource Y.\n- The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of Product A.\n- The company can produce a maximum of 150 units of Product B. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can earn? How many units of each product should the company produce to achieve this profit? You can assume that the objective function and constraints are all quadratic.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 8x + 10y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Resource X constraint: x + y ≤ 500\n2. Resource Y constraint: 2x + y ≤ 700\n3. Product A constraint: 0 ≤ x ≤ 100\n4. Product B constraint: 0 ≤ y ≤ 150\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by plotting these constraints on a graph.\n\n1. x + y = 500\ny = 500 - x\n\n2. 2x + y = 700\ny = 700 - 2x\n\nNow, let's find the intersection points of these lines:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\n500 - x = 700 - 2x\nx = 200\n\nSo, the intersection point is (200, 300).\n\nNow, let's check the intersection points with the product constraints:\n\nIntersection of (1) and x = 100:\ny = 500 - 100 = 400\n\nIntersection of (2) and x = 100:\ny = 700 - 2(100) = 500\n\nIntersection of (1) and y = 150:\nx = 500 - 150 = 350\n\nIntersection of (2) and y = 150:\nx = (700 - 150) / 2 = 275\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region. Since x ≤ 100 and y ≤ 150, the feasible region is a polygon with vertices (0, 0), (100, 0), (100, 150), (0, 150), and (100, 400).\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum profit within this feasible region. We can do this by evaluating the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = 0\nP(100, 0) = 8(100) + 10(0) = 800\nP(100, 150) = 8(100) + 10(150) = 2300\nP(0, 150) = 8(0) + 10(150) = 1500\nP(100, 400) is not in the feasible region since it violates the constraint y ≤ 150.\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (100, 150), with a profit of $2300. The company should produce 100 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B to achieve this profit."
