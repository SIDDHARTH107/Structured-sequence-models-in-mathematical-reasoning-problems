    "message_2": "To find all the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] for which cos(x) = 0.5, we need to consider the unit circle and the cosine function.\n\nThe cosine function represents the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle. When cos(x) = 0.5, the x-coordinate of the point is 0.5. There are two points on the unit circle with an x-coordinate of 0.5, and they are located in the first and fourth quadrants.\n\nIn the first quadrant, the angle x is π/3 (or 60°) because the cosine of π/3 is 0.5. In the fourth quadrant, the angle x is 5π/3 (or 300°) because the cosine of 5π/3 is also 0.5.\n\nSo, the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] for which cos(x) = 0.5 are x = π/3 and x = 5π/3."
