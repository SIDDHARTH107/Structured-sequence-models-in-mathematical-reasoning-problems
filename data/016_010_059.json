    "message_2": "In an Apollonian gasket, if three mutually tangent circles have curvatures k1, k2, and k3, then the curvature k4 of the fourth circle tangent to all three is given by the formula:\n\nk4 = k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nIn this case, we have k1 = 3, k2 = 4, and k3 = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nk4 = 3 + 4 + 5 ± 2 * sqrt(3 * 4 + 4 * 5 + 5 * 3)\nk4 = 12 ± 2 * sqrt(12 + 20 + 15)\nk4 = 12 ± 2 * sqrt(47)\n\nSince the curvature must be positive, we take the positive value:\n\nk4 = 12 + 2 * sqrt(47)\n\nNow, we are asked to find the sum of the curvatures of the three mutually tangent circles and the fourth circle:\n\nSum = k1 + k2 + k3 + k4\nSum = 3 + 4 + 5 + (12 + 2 * sqrt(47))\nSum = 24 + 2 * sqrt(47)\n\nSo, the sum of the curvatures of the three mutually tangent circles in the Apollonian gasket with curvatures 3, 4, and 5, and the fourth circle is 24 + 2 * sqrt(47)."
