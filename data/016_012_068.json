    "message_1": "Suppose you construct the Peano curve by going through 4 iterations, each time replacing each straight line segment of length 1 with a zigzag curve consisting of 3 line segments that form a right angle. What is the length of the resulting curve?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. In the first iteration, we replace the initial straight line segment of length 1 with a zigzag curve consisting of 3 line segments that form a right angle. The length of the resulting curve is 3 * 1 = 3.\n\n2. In the second iteration, we replace each of the 3 line segments from the first iteration with the zigzag curve. Since there are 3 line segments, the total number of line segments in the second iteration is 3 * 3 = 9. The length of each line segment in the second iteration is 1/3, so the total length of the curve is 9 * (1/3) = 3.\n\n3. In the third iteration, we replace each of the 9 line segments from the second iteration with the zigzag curve. Since there are 9 line segments, the total number of line segments in the third iteration is 9 * 3 = 27. The length of each line segment in the third iteration is 1/9, so the total length of the curve is 27 * (1/9) = 3.\n\n4. In the fourth iteration, we replace each of the 27 line segments from the third iteration with the zigzag curve. Since there are 27 line segments, the total number of line segments in the fourth iteration is 27 * 3 = 81. The length of each line segment in the fourth iteration is 1/27, so the total length of the curve is 81 * (1/27) = 3.\n\nSo, after 4 iterations, the length of the resulting Peano curve is 3."
