    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We first transform the problem into polar coordinates since the domain is a circle. Let $x = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y = r\\sin\\theta$. Then, the Laplace's equation becomes:\n\n$\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0$\n\nNow, we assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on $r$ and the other on $\\theta$: $u(r,\\theta) = R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial (R\\Theta)}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 (R\\Theta)}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0$\n\nDividing by $R\\Theta$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{R}\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\Theta}\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Theta}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0$\n\nNow, we separate the variables:\n\n$\\frac{r}{R}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\Theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Theta}{\\partial \\theta^2} = \\lambda$\n\nSolving the ODEs for $R(r)$ and $\\Theta(\\theta)$, we get:\n\n$\\Theta(\\theta) = A\\cos(n\\theta) + B\\sin(n\\theta)$\n\n$R(r) = C_nr^n + D_nr^{-n}$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary condition $u(x,y) = x + 2y$ on $C$. In polar coordinates, this becomes:\n\n$u(r,\\theta) = r\\cos\\theta + 2r\\sin\\theta = R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$, we get:\n\n$R(r)\\cos\\theta = r\\cos\\theta \\Rightarrow R(r) = r$\n\n$R(r)\\sin\\theta = 2r\\sin\\theta \\Rightarrow R(r) = 2r$\n\nSince these are contradictory, we can't find a solution in the form of a product of two functions. However, we can still find a particular solution that satisfies the boundary condition. We can guess a particular solution of the form:\n\n$u_p(r,\\theta) = Ar\\cos\\theta + Br\\sin\\theta$\n\nApplying the boundary condition, we get:\n\n$u_p(r,\\theta) = r\\cos\\theta + 2r\\sin\\theta$\n\nThus, the particular solution is:\n\n$u_p(r,\\theta) = r\\cos\\theta + 2r\\sin\\theta$\n\nSince the Laplace's equation is linear, the particular solution also satisfies the equation. Therefore, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\n$u(r,\\theta) = r\\cos\\theta + 2r\\sin\\theta$"
