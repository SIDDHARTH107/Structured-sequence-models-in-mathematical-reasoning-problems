    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, clowns performing) out of n trials (total clowns)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes out of n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, a clown performing, which is 70% or 0.7)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 10 clowns)\n- k is the number of successes we're interested in (in this case, at least 7 clowns performing)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 7 clowns performing, we need to calculate the probabilities for 7, 8, 9, and 10 clowns performing and then sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\n\nLet's calculate each probability:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0\n\nCalculating the combinations:\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!3!) = 120\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8!2!) = 45\nC(10, 9) = 10! / (9!1!) = 10\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10!0!) = 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3 ≈ 0.2668\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2 ≈ 0.2335\nP(X = 9) = 10 * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1 ≈ 0.1211\nP(X = 10) = 1 * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0 ≈ 0.0282\n\nFinally, let's sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 0.2668 + 0.2335 + 0.1211 + 0.0282 ≈ 0.6496\n\nSo, the probability that at least 7 clowns will perform the comedy skit during the performance is approximately 64.96%."
