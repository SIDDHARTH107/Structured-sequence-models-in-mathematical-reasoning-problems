Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve regarding the Diffie-Hellman key exchange:\n\nSuppose Alice and Bob agree to use the prime number p=11 and the primitive root g=2 for their Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Also, suppose Alice chooses a secret number a=3 and Bob chooses a secret number b=5. Using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, what is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will arrive at?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g=2, a=3, and p=11.\nA = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\n\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where g=2, b=5, and p=11.\nB = 2^5 mod 11 = 32 mod 11 = 10\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p, where B=10, a=3, and p=11.\nK_A = 10^3 mod 11 = 1000 mod 11 = 1\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p, where A=8, b=5, and p=11.\nK_B = 8^5 mod 11 = 32768 mod 11 = 1\n\nSince K_A = K_B, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will arrive at is 1."
