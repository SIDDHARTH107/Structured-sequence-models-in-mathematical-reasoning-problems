    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B, we need to show that every element in the intersection of set A and set B is also an element of set A and set B.\n\nLet's first find the intersection of set A and set B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of set A and set B, denoted as A ∩ B, is {4, 5}.\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of set A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of set A. The elements in A ∩ B are {4, 5}. Both 4 and 5 are elements of set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of set A.\n\nNext, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of set B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of set B. The elements in A ∩ B are {4, 5}. Both 4 and 5 are elements of set B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of set B.\n\nSince A ∩ B is a subset of both set A and set B, we have proved that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B."
