    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 200 liters of water with 5 kg of salt. Salt water containing 0.1 kg of salt per liter is entering the tank at the rate of 5 liters per minute, and the well-mixed solution is leaving the tank at the same rate. How much salt will be in the tank after 30 minutes? (Assume that the tank is well mixed and the concentration of salt is proportional to the amount of salt in the tank at any given time)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at time t as S(t), measured in kg. Since the salt water is entering the tank at a rate of 5 liters per minute with a concentration of 0.1 kg of salt per liter, the rate of salt entering the tank is 5 * 0.1 = 0.5 kg/min.\n\nAt any given time, the concentration of salt in the tank is S(t) / 200, since the volume of the tank remains constant at 200 liters. The rate of salt leaving the tank is the product of this concentration and the outflow rate, which is 5 liters per minute. Therefore, the rate of salt leaving the tank is (S(t) / 200) * 5.\n\nNow we can set up a differential equation to describe the rate of change of salt in the tank:\n\ndS/dt = rate of salt entering - rate of salt leaving\ndS/dt = 0.5 - (S(t) / 200) * 5\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can first rewrite it as:\n\ndS/dt + (5/200) * S(t) = 0.5\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. We can solve it using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\nIF = e^(∫(5/200) dt) = e^(5t/200)\n\nNow, we multiply the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(5t/200) * dS/dt + (5/200) * e^(5t/200) * S(t) = 0.5 * e^(5t/200)\n\nThe left side of this equation is the derivative of the product of S(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt [S(t) * e^(5t/200)] = 0.5 * e^(5t/200)\n\nNow we integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d[S(t) * e^(5t/200)] = ∫0.5 * e^(5t/200) dt\n\nS(t) * e^(5t/200) = 20 * e^(5t/200) + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition S(0) = 5 kg:\n\n5 = 20 + C\nC = -15\n\nNow we have the general solution:\n\nS(t) * e^(5t/200) = 20 * e^(5t/200) - 15\n\nS(t) = 20 - 15 * e^(-5t/200)\n\nWe want to find the amount of salt in the tank after 30 minutes, so we plug in t = 30:\n\nS(30) = 20 - 15 * e^(-5*30/200)\nS(30) = 20 - 15 * e^(-3/2)\n\nS(30) ≈ 20 - 15 * 0.2231\nS(30) ≈ 20 - 3.3465\nS(30) ≈ 16.6535\n\nAfter 30 minutes, there will be approximately 16.6535 kg of salt in the tank."
