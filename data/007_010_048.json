    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nAlice has 3 apples and 4 oranges. Bob has 5 apples and 2 oranges. Charlie has 2 apples and 3 oranges. If they want to share their fruits evenly among themselves, how many fruits does each person get? (Hint: Use the Chinese remainder theorem to solve this problem).",
    "message_2": "The Chinese remainder theorem is not applicable in this situation. Instead, we can simply add up the total number of fruits and divide by the number of people.\n\nTotal apples: 3 (Alice) + 5 (Bob) + 2 (Charlie) = 10 apples\nTotal oranges: 4 (Alice) + 2 (Bob) + 3 (Charlie) = 9 oranges\n\nTotal fruits: 10 apples + 9 oranges = 19 fruits\n\nThere are 3 people (Alice, Bob, and Charlie), so we divide the total number of fruits by 3:\n\n19 fruits รท 3 people = 6 fruits with 1 fruit remaining\n\nEach person will get 6 fruits. However, there will be 1 fruit remaining that cannot be evenly distributed among the three of them."
