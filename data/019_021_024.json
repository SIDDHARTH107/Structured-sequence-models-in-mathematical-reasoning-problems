    "message_1": "Two players, A and B, are playing a game. Each player can choose to either cooperate or defect. If both players cooperate, they each receive a payoff of 3. If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of 1. If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives a payoff of 5 and the cooperator receives a payoff of 0. \n\nSuppose A always cooperates, what strategy should B choose in order to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "Since player A always cooperates, player B should choose to defect in order to maximize their own payoff. If player B defects while player A cooperates, player B will receive a payoff of 5, which is higher than the payoff of 3 they would receive if they also cooperated."
