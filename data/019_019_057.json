    "message_2": "Let's consider a Turing Machine M that checks if a given binary string has an even number of 1s. We can define the language L as the set of all binary strings with an even number of 1s.\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of M with respect to L.\n\n1. If a string s ∈ L, then s has an even number of 1s. Since M is designed to accept strings with an even number of 1s, M will accept s.\n\n2. If a string s ∉ L, then s has an odd number of 1s. M will reject s because it only accepts strings with an even number of 1s.\n\nTherefore, M accepts all strings in L and rejects all strings not in L. In this specific example, M accepts all strings in L and rejects all strings outside of L."
