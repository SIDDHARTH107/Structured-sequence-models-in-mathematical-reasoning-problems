    "message_2": "As a language model AI, I cannot directly plot graphs. However, I can guide you on how to solve the polynomial equation graphically and find its zeros.\n\nTo solve the polynomial equation y = x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 8 graphically, you need to plot the function on a graph and find the points where the curve intersects the x-axis. These points are the zeros of the polynomial.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Choose a range of x-values to plot the function. For this polynomial, a range of x-values from -2 to 5 should be sufficient to capture all the zeros.\n\n2. Calculate the corresponding y-values for each x-value using the equation y = x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 8.\n\n3. Plot the points (x, y) on a graph.\n\n4. Draw a smooth curve through the points to create the graph of the function.\n\n5. Identify the points where the curve intersects the x-axis. These points are the zeros of the polynomial.\n\n6. If necessary, you can use numerical methods (such as the bisection method or Newton's method) to find the approximate values of the zeros.\n\nRemember that a polynomial of degree 4 can have up to 4 real zeros. In this case, you might find that the polynomial has fewer than 4 real zeros, which means that some of the zeros are complex (not real)."
