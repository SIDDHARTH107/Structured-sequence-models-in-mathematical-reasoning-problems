    "message_2": "To find the average value of the sound wave over the interval [0, π], we need to integrate the function over this interval and then divide by the length of the interval.\n\nThe average value formula is:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫(f(x) dx) from a to b\n\nIn this case, the function is y = 7sin(5x) - 2cos(8x), and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫(7sin(5x) - 2cos(8x) dx) from 0 to π\n\nFirst, we need to find the integral of the function:\n\n∫(7sin(5x) - 2cos(8x) dx) = (-7/5)cos(5x) - (1/4)sin(8x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\n((-7/5)cos(5π) - (1/4)sin(8π)) - ((-7/5)cos(0) - (1/4)sin(0))\n\n= ((-7/5)(-1) - 0) - ((-7/5)(1) - 0)\n\n= (7/5) + (7/5)\n\n= 14/5\n\nNow, we can find the average value by dividing this result by the length of the interval (π):\n\nAverage value = (14/5) / π\n\nAverage value ≈ 0.8914\n\nSo, the average value of the sound wave over the interval [0, π] is approximately 0.8914."
