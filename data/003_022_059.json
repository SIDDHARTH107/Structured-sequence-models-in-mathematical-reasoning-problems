    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √((-2)² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the vectors A and B. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B. To find the dot product, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = (A_x * B_x) + (A_y * B_y)\n\nSo, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (3 * -2) + (4 * 5) = -6 + 20 = 14\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (14) / (5 * √29)\n\nθ = arccos(14 / (5 * √29))\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the dot product of A and B using the trigonometric formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * cos(θ)\n\nHowever, since we already found the dot product using the algebraic method (A · B = 14), we can conclude that:\n\nA · B = 14"
