    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding the particle between x = 0.2 nm and x = 0.8 nm, we need to integrate the square of the wave function (ψ^2(x)) over this interval. The wave function is given by:\n\nψ(x) = √(2/L)sin(nπx/L), where n = 1 and L = 1 nm.\n\nSo, ψ(x) = √2sin(πx).\n\nNow, we need to find ψ^2(x):\n\nψ^2(x) = (ψ(x))^2 = (2sin(πx))^2 = 2sin^2(πx).\n\nNext, we integrate ψ^2(x) over the interval [0.2 nm, 0.8 nm]:\n\nP(x) = ∫[0.2, 0.8] 2sin^2(πx) dx.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the double-angle formula for sin^2(x):\n\nsin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2.\n\nSo, ψ^2(x) = 2(1 - cos(2πx))/2 = 1 - cos(2πx).\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\nP(x) = ∫[0.2, 0.8] (1 - cos(2πx)) dx.\n\nIntegrating each term separately:\n\n∫[0.2, 0.8] 1 dx = x | [0.2, 0.8] = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6.\n\n∫[0.2, 0.8] -cos(2πx) dx = (-1/(2π))sin(2πx) | [0.2, 0.8].\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n(-1/(2π))sin(2π(0.8)) - (-1/(2π))sin(2π(0.2)) = (-1/(2π))(sin(1.6π) - sin(0.4π)).\n\nSo, the total probability is:\n\nP(x) = 0.6 + (-1/(2π))(sin(1.6π) - sin(0.4π)) ≈ 0.6 - 0.048.\n\nP(x) ≈ 0.552.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the particle between x = 0.2 nm and x = 0.8 nm is approximately 0.552 or 55.2%."
