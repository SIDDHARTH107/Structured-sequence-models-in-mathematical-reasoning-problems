    "message_2": "To find the union of set A and set B, we combine all the unique elements from both sets. \n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3}\nSet B = {2, 4, 6}\n\nUnion of set A and set B: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, to find a superset of the union of set A and set B, we need a set that contains all the elements of the union and possibly more elements. One example of a superset would be:\n\nSuperset: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNote that there can be multiple different supersets, as long as they contain all the elements of the union of set A and set B."
