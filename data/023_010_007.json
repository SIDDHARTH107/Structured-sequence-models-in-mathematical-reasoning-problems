    "message_1": "Consider an 8x8 grayscale image with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. Apply the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to this image and compute the DFT coefficients for the pixel at row 3, column 6. Assume that the origin of the DFT is at the top-left corner of the image.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the 8x8 grayscale image as I(x, y), where x and y are the row and column indices, respectively. The 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of this image can be computed using the following formula:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ (x=0 to 7) Σ (y=0 to 7) I(x, y) * exp(-2πi(ux/8 + vy/8))\n\nHere, F(u, v) represents the DFT coefficients, and i is the imaginary unit. We are interested in computing the DFT coefficients for the pixel at row 3 (u=3) and column 6 (v=6).\n\nF(3, 6) = Σ (x=0 to 7) Σ (y=0 to 7) I(x, y) * exp(-2πi(3x/8 + 6y/8))\n\nTo compute the DFT coefficients for the specific pixel, we need the pixel values of the image I(x, y). Since the image is not provided, we cannot compute the exact DFT coefficients. However, the formula above can be used to compute the DFT coefficients once the image is provided."
