    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you are tasked with minimizing the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 using the differential evolution algorithm. Assume that the initial population consists of 10 individuals, each with three decision variables (x1, x2, x3) selected uniformly at random from the interval [0, 10]. The mutation factor F is set to 0.8, the crossover probability CR is set to 0.9, and the termination criterion is set to 1000 function evaluations. Implement the differential evolution algorithm and determine the optimal solution and resulting function value.",
