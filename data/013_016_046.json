    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players, A and B, who can each choose between two strategies, S1 or S2, in a game of Moral Hazard. If player A chooses S1, the payoff for A is 500 if player B chooses S1, and 800 if player B chooses S2. If player A chooses S2, the payoff for A is 900 if player B chooses S1, and 200 if player B chooses S2. However, player B will only know what strategy player A has chosen after making their own decision. If player B chooses S1, the payoff for B is 600 if player A chooses S1, and 400 if player A chooses S2. If player B chooses S2, the payoff for B is 700 if player A chooses S1, and 800 if player A chooses S2. What is the Nash Equilibrium for this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to determine the best response for each player given the other player's strategy. We can represent the payoffs in a matrix:\n\n```\n          B\n          S1   S2\n        ┌─────┬─────┐\n      S1│500,600│800,700│\nA       ├─────┼─────┤\n      S2│900,400│200,800│\n        └─────┴─────┘\n```\n\nLet's find the best response for player A given player B's strategy:\n\n- If player B chooses S1, player A's payoffs are 500 (S1) and 900 (S2). Player A's best response is S2.\n- If player B chooses S2, player A's payoffs are 800 (S1) and 200 (S2). Player A's best response is S1.\n\nNow let's find the best response for player B given player A's strategy:\n\n- If player A chooses S1, player B's payoffs are 600 (S1) and 700 (S2). Player B's best response is S2.\n- If player A chooses S2, player B's payoffs are 400 (S1) and 800 (S2). Player B's best response is S2.\n\nNow we can find the Nash Equilibrium by identifying the strategy pairs where both players are playing their best response:\n\n- (S1, S2) is a Nash Equilibrium because player A's best response to S2 is S1, and player B's best response to S1 is S2.\n\nSo the Nash Equilibrium for this game is (S1, S2)."
