    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. The factory has a total of 800 units of raw material, 60 hours of labor, and a maximum storage capacity of 150 units. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of raw material, 3 hours of labor, and takes up 2 units of storage space, while each unit of product B requires 3 units of raw material, 2 hours of labor, and takes up 1 unit of storage space. If the profit from the sale of a unit of product A is $5 and the profit from the sale of a unit of product B is$4, what is the maximum profit the factory can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for raw material, labor, and storage capacity are as follows:\n\nRaw material: 2x + 3y ≤ 800\nLabor: 3x + 2y ≤ 60\nStorage: 2x + y ≤ 150\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 5x + 4y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies all the constraints and then find the maximum value of the objective function.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 800\n   y ≤ (800 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. Labor constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 60\n   y ≤ (60 - 3x) / 2\n\n3. Storage constraint: 2x + y ≤ 150\n   y ≤ 150 - 2x\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points of these constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of raw material and labor constraints:\n   (800 - 2x) / 3 = (60 - 3x) / 2\n   1600 - 4x = 180 - 9x\n   5x = 1420\n   x = 284/5 = 56.8\n\n   y = (60 - 3x) / 2\n   y = (60 - 3(56.8)) / 2\n   y = 10.2\n\n2. Intersection of raw material and storage constraints:\n   (800 - 2x) / 3 = 150 - 2x\n   800 - 2x = 450 - 6x\n   4x = 350\n   x = 87.5\n\n   y = 150 - 2x\n   y = 150 - 2(87.5)\n   y = -25 (This value is not feasible since y cannot be negative)\n\n3. Intersection of labor and storage constraints:\n   (60 - 3x) / 2 = 150 - 2x\n   120 - 6x = 150 - 2x\n   4x = 30\n   x = 7.5\n\n   y = 150 - 2x\n   y = 150 - 2(7.5)\n   y = 135\n\nNow, we need to check the objective function at the intersection points and the origin (0,0):\n\n1. Profit at (0,0): 5(0) + 4(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (56.8, 10.2): 5(56.8) + 4(10.2) = $284 + $40.8 = $324.8\n3. Profit at (7.5, 135): 5(7.5) + 4(135) = $37.5 + $540 = $577.5\n\nThe maximum profit is $577.5, which occurs when the factory produces 7.5 units of product A and 135 units of product B. Since the factory cannot produce a fraction of a unit, it should produce 7 units of product A and 135 units of product B to achieve a maximum profit of $572."
