    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by -2. So, we can write the second equation as:\n\n-2(-2x + 3y) = -2(7)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4x - 6y = 14\n\nSince both equations are the same, this system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and they are dependent. To find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\n-2x + 3y = 7\n\nAdd 2x to both sides:\n\n3y = 2x + 7\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\ny = (2x + 7) / 3\n\nSo, the general solution for this system of linear equations is y = (2x + 7) / 3."
