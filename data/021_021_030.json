    "message_1": "A company is trying to minimize the cost of producing a certain product. The production cost consists of a fixed cost of $50,000 and a variable cost of $25 per unit. The company can produce at most 20,000 units of the product. Using the Cuckoo Search algorithm, find the optimal production quantity that minimizes the overall cost.",
    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. To apply the Cuckoo Search algorithm to this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: In this case, the objective function is the total cost of production, which is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost. The function can be represented as:\n\n   Total Cost = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost * Production Quantity)\n\n2. Set the algorithm parameters: The parameters for the Cuckoo Search algorithm include the number of nests (n), the probability of discovering a host's egg (p), and the step size (α). For this problem, we can set n = 25, p = 0.25, and α = 0.01.\n\n3. Initialize the nests: Generate n random solutions (nests) within the search space, which is the production quantity between 0 and 20,000 units.\n\n4. Evaluate the nests: Calculate the total cost for each nest using the objective function.\n\n5. Perform the search: For each iteration, generate a new solution (cuckoo egg) by modifying a randomly chosen nest using the step size (α). Evaluate the new solution and replace the worst nest with the new solution if it has a better objective function value. With probability p, choose a random nest and replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for a predefined number of iterations or until the convergence criterion is met.\n\n7. Select the best solution: The nest with the lowest total cost represents the optimal production quantity.\n\nBy applying the Cuckoo Search algorithm to this problem, we can find the optimal production quantity that minimizes the overall cost. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute the algorithm and provide the exact optimal production quantity. You can implement the Cuckoo Search algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB to obtain the solution."
