    "message_1": "In a Feistel cipher with 16 rounds, the block size is 64 bits and the key size is 128 bits. How many total XOR operations are performed during the encryption process (excluding any key setup operations)?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, each round consists of two main operations: an XOR operation and a substitution operation (usually called the F-function). The XOR operation is performed on half of the block size, which in this case is 32 bits (since the block size is 64 bits). \n\nSince there are 16 rounds, the total number of XOR operations performed during the encryption process is:\n\n16 rounds * 1 XOR operation per round * 32 bits per XOR operation = 16 * 1 * 32 = 512 XOR operations."
