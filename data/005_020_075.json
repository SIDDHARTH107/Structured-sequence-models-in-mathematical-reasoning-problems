    "message_1": "Suppose a car rental agency has 10 Toyota Camry cars in their fleet, each of which has an average fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon. The agency wants to estimate the average fuel efficiency of their fleet by running a Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations. For each iteration, assume that the actual fuel efficiency per each Camry car in the fleet is uniformly distributed from 22 to 28 miles per gallon. What is the estimated average fuel efficiency of the car rental agency's fleet after running the Monte Carlo simulation?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the average fuel efficiency of the car rental agency's fleet using a Monte Carlo simulation, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Run 1000 iterations.\n2. In each iteration, generate 10 random fuel efficiency values for each of the 10 Toyota Camry cars, uniformly distributed between 22 and 28 miles per gallon.\n3. Calculate the average fuel efficiency for each iteration.\n4. Calculate the overall average fuel efficiency across all iterations.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\niterations = 1000\ntotal_cars = 10\ntotal_fuel_efficiency = 0\n\nfor i in range(iterations):\n    iteration_fuel_efficiency = 0\n    for j in range(total_cars):\n        car_fuel_efficiency = random.uniform(22, 28)\n        iteration_fuel_efficiency += car_fuel_efficiency\n    iteration_fuel_efficiency /= total_cars\n    total_fuel_efficiency += iteration_fuel_efficiency\n\nestimated_average_fuel_efficiency = total_fuel_efficiency / iterations\n```\n\nAfter running the Monte Carlo simulation, the estimated average fuel efficiency of the car rental agency's fleet will be stored in the variable `estimated_average_fuel_efficiency`. This value will be close to the true average fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon, but it may not be exactly 25 due to the randomness involved in the simulation."
