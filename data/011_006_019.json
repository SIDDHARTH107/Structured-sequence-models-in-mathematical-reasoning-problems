The remaining prize money will be given as consolation prizes for the fourth and fifth place finishers. How many different ways can the company distribute the consolation prizes if there are ten competitors in the competition?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how much money is left for the consolation prizes after giving the top three winners their prizes. The total prize money is $500, and the top three winners receive $200, $150, and $100, respectively. So, the total amount given to the top three winners is:\n\n$200 + $150 + $100 = $450\n\nNow, let's subtract this amount from the total prize money to find out how much is left for the consolation prizes:\n\n$500 - $450 = $50\n\nSo, there is $50 left to be distributed as consolation prizes for the fourth and fifth place finishers. Let x be the amount given to the fourth place finisher and y be the amount given to the fifth place finisher. We have the following equation:\n\nx + y = $50\n\nSince x and y must be whole numbers (as we cannot give out fractional amounts of money), we can find the different ways to distribute the consolation prizes by finding the different pairs of whole numbers (x, y) that satisfy the equation.\n\n1. x = $1, y = $49\n2. x = $2, y = $48\n3. x = $3, y = $47\n...\n...\n47. x = $47, y = $3\n48. x = $48, y = $2\n49. x = $49, y = $1\n\nThere are 49 different ways to distribute the consolation prizes among the fourth and fifth place finishers."
