    "message_2": "To find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent of a 30-degree angle, we can use the properties of special right triangles, specifically the 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2.\n\nLet's find the values:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of 30 degrees:\nsin(30) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, and the hypotenuse is 2.\nsin(30) = 1/2\n\n2. Cosine (cos) of 30 degrees:\ncos(30) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\ncos(30) = √3/2\n\n3. Tangent (tan) of 30 degrees:\ntan(30) = opposite side / adjacent side\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle is √3.\ntan(30) = 1/√3\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\ntan(30) = (√3/3)\n\nSo, the values are:\nsin(30) = 1/2\ncos(30) = √3/2\ntan(30) = √3/3"
