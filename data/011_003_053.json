    "message_2": "To find the number of different committees of three people that can be formed from a group of seven people, we need to find the number of combinations of choosing 3 people from 7. This can be represented as C(7,3) or 7C3, which can be found using Pascal's Triangle.\n\nPascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows of Pascal's Triangle are:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n```\n\nTo find 7C3, we look at the 8th row (starting from the row with a single 1 as the 1st row) and the 4th number in that row. In this case, the 4th number in the 8th row is 35.\n\nSo, there are 35 different committees of three people that can be formed from a group of seven people."
