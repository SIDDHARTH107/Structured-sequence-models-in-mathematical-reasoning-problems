    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit obtained from each unit of product A is $5 and from each unit of product B is $7. The company has 500 units of raw material available and 200 hours of work time. To produce one unit of product A requires 4 units of raw material and 2 hours of work time, whereas to produce one unit of product B requires 3 units of raw material and 4 hours of work time. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize its profit? Use the firefly algorithm to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is based on the flashing behavior of fireflies. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute the firefly algorithm directly. Instead, I can help you set up the problem and guide you through the steps to solve it using the firefly algorithm.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective is to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 500 (raw material constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 200 (work time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo solve this problem using the firefly algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions (x, y) within the feasible region.\n2. Define the attractiveness and brightness of each firefly based on the profit function P(x, y). The higher the profit, the brighter and more attractive the firefly.\n3. Move the less attractive fireflies towards the more attractive ones based on their attractiveness and distance.\n4. Update the positions of the fireflies and evaluate their new profit values.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for a predefined number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.\n6. Select the firefly with the highest profit value as the optimal solution.\n\nBy following these steps, you can find the optimal number of units of products A and B to produce in order to maximize the profit using the firefly algorithm. Note that you will need a programming language or software that supports the firefly algorithm to implement these steps."
