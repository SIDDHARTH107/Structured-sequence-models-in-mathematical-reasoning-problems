    "message_2": "To find the minimum weight of a spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we first sort the edges by their weights in ascending order. Then, we add the edges to the spanning tree one by one, making sure not to create cycles. We continue this process until we have connected all the nodes.\n\nSorted edges by weight: (1-4, 2), (2-5, 3), (1-2, 8), (4-5, 9), (1-5, 5), (2-4, 6)\n\n1. Add edge (1-4, 2) to the spanning tree.\n2. Add edge (2-5, 3) to the spanning tree.\n3. Edge (1-2, 8) would create a cycle, so skip it.\n4. Edge (4-5, 9) would create a cycle, so skip it.\n5. Add edge (1-5, 5) to the spanning tree.\n6. Add edge (2-4, 6) to the spanning tree.\n\nNow all nodes are connected, and the minimum spanning tree is complete. The edges in the minimum spanning tree are (1-4, 2), (2-5, 3), (1-5, 5), and (2-4, 6).\n\nThe minimum weight of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights of these edges: 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 16."
