    "message_2": "To find the exact value of the sine of 60 degrees using the unit circle, we first need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. \n\n60 degrees * (π/180) = (π/3) radians\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle to find the sine of this angle. On the unit circle, the sine of an angle is equal to the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle.\n\nFor a 60-degree angle (π/3 radians), the point on the unit circle is (1/2, √3/2). Therefore, the sine of 60 degrees is:\n\nsin(60°) = sin(π/3) = √3/2"
