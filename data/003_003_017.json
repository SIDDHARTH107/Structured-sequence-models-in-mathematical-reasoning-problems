    "message_2": "To find the cosine and sine values for the angle 120 degrees using the unit circle method, we first need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. \n\n1 degree = π/180 radians\n120 degrees = (120 * π) / 180 = (2 * π) / 3 radians\n\nNow, let's use the unit circle method. The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1, centered at the origin (0, 0) of the coordinate plane. The angle is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. \n\nFor an angle of (2 * π) / 3 radians, we can find the reference angle by subtracting π radians (180 degrees) from the given angle:\n\nReference angle = (2 * π) / 3 - π = π / 3 radians (60 degrees)\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the reference angle intersects the unit circle. For a 60-degree angle (π / 3 radians), the coordinates are:\n\nx = cos(π / 3) = 1/2\ny = sin(π / 3) = √3 / 2\n\nSince the original angle (120 degrees) is in the second quadrant, the x-coordinate (cosine) will be negative, and the y-coordinate (sine) will be positive:\n\ncos(120 degrees) = cos((2 * π) / 3) = -1/2\nsin(120 degrees) = sin((2 * π) / 3) = √3 / 2"
