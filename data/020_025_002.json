What is the shortest distance the driver can travel in order to deliver all 5 packages and return to the starting point? \n\nStarting point: 0 km\nLocation 1: 2 km\nLocation 2: 4 km\nLocation 3: 3 km\nLocation 4: 5 km\nLocation 5: 1 km",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance the driver can travel to deliver all 5 packages and return to the starting point, we can use the round-trip method. This means that the driver will travel to each location and then return to the starting point.\n\nHere are the distances for each round-trip:\n\nStarting point to Location 1 and back: 2 km + 2 km = 4 km\nStarting point to Location 2 and back: 4 km + 4 km = 8 km\nStarting point to Location 3 and back: 3 km + 3 km = 6 km\nStarting point to Location 4 and back: 5 km + 5 km = 10 km\nStarting point to Location 5 and back: 1 km + 1 km = 2 km\n\nNow, we add up all the round-trip distances:\n\n4 km + 8 km + 6 km + 10 km + 2 km = 30 km\n\nSo, the shortest distance the driver can travel to deliver all 5 packages and return to the starting point is 30 km."
