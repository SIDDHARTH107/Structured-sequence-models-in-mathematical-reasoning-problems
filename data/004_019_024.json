Give your answers in feet per second for velocity and feet per second squared for acceleration. Assume the acceleration due to gravity is constant at 32 feet per second squared.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the ball after 2 seconds, we can use the equations of motion for an object in free fall under constant acceleration:\n\n1. Position equation: s(t) = s0 + v0*t + 0.5*a*t^2\n2. Velocity equation: v(t) = v0 + a*t\n3. Acceleration equation: a(t) = a (constant)\n\nGiven:\nInitial height (s0) = 100 feet\nInitial velocity (v0) = 0 (since the ball is dropped)\nAcceleration due to gravity (a) = -32 feet/second^2 (negative sign indicates downward direction)\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity after 2 seconds using the velocity equation:\n\nv(2) = v0 + a*t\nv(2) = 0 + (-32)*2\nv(2) = -64 feet/second\n\nThe velocity of the ball after 2 seconds is -64 feet/second (downward direction).\n\nNow, let's find the acceleration after 2 seconds. Since the acceleration due to gravity is constant, the acceleration at any time, including 2 seconds, will be the same:\n\na(2) = a\na(2) = -32 feet/second^2\n\nThe acceleration of the ball after 2 seconds is -32 feet/second^2 (downward direction).\n\nSo, the velocity of the ball after 2 seconds is -64 feet/second, and the acceleration is -32 feet/second^2."
