    "message_2": "Proof by contradiction:\n\nAssume that there exists a rational number x that satisfies the equation x^2 - 3 = 0. Since x is a rational number, we can express it as a fraction x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., a and b are coprime), and b â‰  0.\n\nNow, let's substitute x = a/b into the equation:\n\n(a/b)^2 - 3 = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\na^2 / b^2 = 3\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by b^2:\n\na^2 = 3b^2\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that a^2 is divisible by 3, which means that a must also be divisible by 3 (since 3 is a prime number). Let's express a as a = 3k, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, let's substitute a = 3k back into the equation:\n\n(3k)^2 = 3b^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n9k^2 = 3b^2\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n3k^2 = b^2\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that b^2 is divisible by 3, which means that b must also be divisible by 3 (since 3 is a prime number).\n\nHowever, this contradicts our initial assumption that a and b have no common factors other than 1 (i.e., they are coprime). Since both a and b are divisible by 3, they have a common factor of 3.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there exists a rational number x that satisfies the equation x^2 - 3 = 0 must be false. Hence, there is no rational number that satisfies the given equation. QED."
