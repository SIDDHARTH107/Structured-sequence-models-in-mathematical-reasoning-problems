    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 5x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 5, b = 3, and c = -2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (the part inside the square root):\n\nDiscriminant = b^2 - 4ac = (3)^2 - 4(5)(-2) = 9 + 40 = 49\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-3 ± √49) / 2(5)\n\nx = (-3 ± 7) / 10\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\nx1 = (-3 + 7) / 10 = 4 / 10 = 2/5\nx2 = (-3 - 7) / 10 = -10 / 10 = -1\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation 5x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0 are x = 2/5 and x = -1."
