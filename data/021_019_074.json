    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. Here's a step-by-step guide to applying the HS algorithm to the given problem:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n\n- Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solution vectors in the harmony memory. Let's choose HMS = 5.\n- Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of choosing a value from the harmony memory. Let's choose HMCR = 0.8.\n- Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting a value after it has been chosen. Let's choose PAR = 0.3.\n- Number of iterations (NI): The number of times the algorithm will be executed. Let's choose NI = 100.\n\n2. Initialize the harmony memory:\n\nCreate an initial harmony memory (HM) by randomly generating 5 solution vectors (x-values) that satisfy the constraint g(x) = 2x - 5 ≥ 0. For example:\n\nHM = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n3. Improvise a new harmony:\n\nFor each iteration, create a new harmony vector (x_new) by following these steps:\n\na. Choose a value from the harmony memory with a probability of HMCR. For example, x_new = 4 (chosen from HM).\n\nb. Adjust the chosen value with a probability of PAR. For example, x_new = 4 + 0.1 = 4.1.\n\nc. If the new harmony vector (x_new) satisfies the constraint g(x_new) ≥ 0, calculate its fitness (f(x_new)) and proceed to the next step. Otherwise, repeat steps a and b until a valid x_new is found.\n\n4. Update the harmony memory:\n\nIf the fitness of the new harmony vector (f(x_new)) is better than the worst fitness in the harmony memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the specified number of iterations (NI).\n\n6. Find the best solution:\n\nAfter completing all iterations, the harmony vector with the best fitness in the harmony memory is the optimal solution.\n\nApplying the HS algorithm with the chosen parameters to the given problem, you'll find the optimal solution for the constrained optimization problem. Note that the actual solution may vary depending on the random initializations and parameter choices."
