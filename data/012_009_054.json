One possible graph with the given degree sequence can be drawn as follows:\n\nLet the vertices be labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.\n\nEdges:\n1. A - B, A - C (degree of A = 2)\n2. B - C, B - D (degree of B = 2)\n3. C - D, C - E (degree of C = 3)\n4. D - E, D - F (degree of D = 3)\n5. E - F, E - G, E - H (degree of E = 4)\n6. F - G, F - H, F - I (degree of F = 4)\n7.
