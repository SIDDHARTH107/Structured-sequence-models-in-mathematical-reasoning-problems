    "message_1": "On a road trip from New York to Miami, the probability of encountering at least one toll booth is 0.8. If there are 5 toll booths on the route, what is the probability that the travelers will encounter all 5 toll booths?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event of encountering at least one toll booth, and let B be the event of encountering all 5 toll booths. We are given P(A) = 0.8 and asked to find P(B).\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of not encountering any toll booth, which we'll call P(A'). Since there are only two possibilities (either encountering at least one toll booth or not encountering any), we have:\n\nP(A) + P(A') = 1\nP(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of encountering each toll booth independently. Let T_i be the event of encountering the i-th toll booth, and let T_i' be the event of not encountering the i-th toll booth. We have:\n\nP(T_1' ∩ T_2' ∩ T_3' ∩ T_4' ∩ T_5') = P(A')\n\nSince the toll booths are independent, we can write this as:\n\nP(T_1') * P(T_2') * P(T_3') * P(T_4') * P(T_5') = 0.2\n\nNow, let p be the probability of encountering a single toll booth, and let q = 1 - p be the probability of not encountering a single toll booth. Then we have:\n\nq^5 = 0.2\n\nSolving for q:\n\nq = (0.2)^(1/5) ≈ 0.672\n\nNow we can find p:\n\np = 1 - q ≈ 1 - 0.672 ≈ 0.328\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of encountering all 5 toll booths, which is P(B):\n\nP(B) = P(T_1 ∩ T_2 ∩ T_3 ∩ T_4 ∩ T_5)\n\nSince the toll booths are independent, we can write this as:\n\nP(B) = P(T_1) * P(T_2) * P(T_3) * P(T_4) * P(T_5) = p^5\n\nP(B) ≈ (0.328)^5 ≈ 0.0039\n\nSo the probability of encountering all 5 toll booths is approximately 0.0039 or 0.39%."
