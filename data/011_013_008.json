    "message_1": "In a group of 8 people, how many different ways can they be seated at a round table if there are 4 chairs on one side and 4 on the other? (Assume that rotations and reflections are considered the same and indistinguishable)",
    "message_2": "Since rotations and reflections are considered the same and indistinguishable, we can fix one person's position and arrange the remaining 7 people. \n\nThere are 4 chairs on one side and 4 on the other. Let's first arrange the people on one side of the table. There are 7 people left to choose from for the first chair, 6 for the second, 5 for the third, and 4 for the fourth. So, there are 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 840 ways to arrange the people on one side of the table.\n\nNow, let's arrange the people on the other side of the table. There are 3 people left to choose from for the first chair, 2 for the second, and 1 for the third. The last person will automatically sit in the last chair. So, there are 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways to arrange the people on the other side of the table.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people at the round table, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the people on each side: 840 * 6 = 5040 different ways."
