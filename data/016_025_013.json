    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that forms a larger equilateral triangle made up of smaller equilateral triangles. With each iteration, the number of smaller triangles increases. \n\nIn the first iteration, there is 1 triangle.\nIn the second iteration, there are 3 triangles.\nIn the third iteration, there are 9 triangles.\n\nFor the fourth iteration, we can use the formula for the number of triangles in the Sierpinski sieve:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^n, where n is the iteration number.\n\nNumber of triangles in the fourth iteration = 3^4 = 81 triangles."
