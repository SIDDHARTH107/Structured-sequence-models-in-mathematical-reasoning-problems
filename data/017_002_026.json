    "message_2": "To find all subgroups of G, we will use the fact that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 15, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {e} is always a subgroup of any group, and it is cyclic since e is the identity element.\n\n2. Let's find subgroups of order 3. The divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. We know that if a subgroup has order 3, then it must be of the form <a^k> for some k, where a is the generator of G. We want to find k such that (a^k)^3 = a^(3k) = e. Since the order of a is 15, we have a^15 = e. Therefore, we need to find k such that 3k is a multiple of 15. The smallest such k is 5. So, the subgroup of order 3 is <a^5> = {e, a^5, a^{10}}. This subgroup is cyclic because it is generated by a single element, a^5.\n\n3. Now, let's find subgroups of order 5. We want to find k such that (a^k)^5 = a^(5k) = e. Since the order of a is 15, we need to find k such that 5k is a multiple of 15. The smallest such k is 3. So, the subgroup of order 5 is <a^3> = {e, a^3, a^6, a^9, a^{12}}. This subgroup is cyclic because it is generated by a single element, a^3.\n\n4. Finally, the whole group G itself is a subgroup of order 15. It is cyclic by definition, as it is generated by the single element a.\n\nIn conclusion, the subgroups of G are {e}, <a^5> = {e, a^5, a^{10}}, <a^3> = {e, a^3, a^6, a^9, a^{12}}, and G itself. Each of these subgroups is cyclic, as they are all generated by a single element."
