    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic polynomial of the graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) represents the number of ways to color the graph G with k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\n1. Choose an edge e = {u, v} in the graph G. Let's choose the edge {1, 2}.\n2. Compute the chromatic polynomial of the graph G-e obtained by deleting the edge e from G. In our case, G-e has edges: {1,5}, {2,3}, {2,5}, {3,4}, and {4,5}.\n3. Compute the chromatic polynomial of the graph G/e obtained by contracting the edge e in G. In our case, G/e has vertices 1, 3, 4, and 5, and edges: {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,5}, {3,4}, and {4,5}.\n4. The chromatic polynomial of G is given by P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k).\n\nNow we need to compute the chromatic polynomial for G-e and G/e.\n\nFor G-e, we can see that it is a cycle of length 5. The chromatic polynomial for a cycle of length n is given by P(C_n, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So, P(G-e, k) = (k-1)^5 + (-1)^5 (k-1).\n\nFor G/e, we can see that it is a tree with 4 vertices. The chromatic polynomial for a tree with n vertices is given by P(T_n, k) = k(k-1)^(n-1). So, P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)^3.\n\nNow we can compute the chromatic polynomial for G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k) = ((k-1)^5 + (-1)^5 (k-1)) - k(k-1)^3.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^3 * ((k-1)^2 - k + 1).\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the graph G."
