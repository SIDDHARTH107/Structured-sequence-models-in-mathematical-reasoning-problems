    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products - X and Y. The production process requires two raw materials - A and B. The daily availability of raw materials is 20 units of A and 16 units of B. It takes 3 units of A and 2 units of B to produce product X, and 1 unit of A and 4 units of B to produce product Y. The profit earned by the company on each unit of product X and product Y is $4 and $5 respectively. Determine the maximum profit the company can earn in a day, assuming it can produce any combination of X and Y.",
