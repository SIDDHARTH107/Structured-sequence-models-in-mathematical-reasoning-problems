    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for the student:\n\nConsider the following partial differential equation:\n\n∂²u/∂x² + 4u = 0\n\nwith boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = u(π,t) = 0\n\nUsing Fourier series, find the solution u(x,t) that satisfies the given boundary conditions and initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = x - 2π, 0 ≤ x ≤ π\n\nNote: You may assume that the solution satisfies the boundary conditions in the sense of Fourier series.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation with the given boundary conditions and initial condition using Fourier series, we first need to find the Fourier sine series representation of the initial condition function, f(x) = x - 2π, on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π.\n\nThe Fourier sine series representation of a function f(x) on the interval [0, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L.\n\nIn our case, L = π, so we have:\n\nf(x) = Σ [B_n * sin(nx)]\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients B_n:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * ∫[(x - 2π) * sin(nx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nTo calculate B_n, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x - 2π, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n)cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * [(-(x - 2π)/n) * cos(nx) - ∫(cos(nx)/n) dx] from 0 to π\n\nB_n = (2/π) * [(-(x - 2π)/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n²) * sin(nx)] from 0 to π\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * {[-(π - 2π)/n) * cos(nπ) + (1/n²) * sin(nπ) - (0 - 2π)/n * cos(0) + (1/n²) * sin(0)]}\n\nB_n = (2/π) * {[(π/n) * cos(nπ) - 2π/n]}\n\nNow that we have the coefficients B_n, we can write the Fourier sine series representation of the initial condition function:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2/π) * (π/n) * cos(nπ) - 2π/n] * sin(nx)\n\nSince the given partial differential equation is homogeneous, the solution u(x, t) will have the same form as the Fourier sine series representation of the initial condition function, with each term multiplied by an exponential function of time:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(2/π) * (π/n) * cos(nπ) - 2π/n] * sin(nx) * e^(-4t)\n\nThis is the solution to the given partial differential equation with the given boundary conditions and initial condition."
