    "message_1": "A cable company charges a base fee of $20 for internet and an additional charge of $0.03 per megabit of data. If a customer wants to minimize their monthly bill and requires 500 megabits of data, what is the optimal plan for the customer?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal plan for the customer, we need to calculate the total cost of the plan based on the base fee and the additional charge for the required data.\n\nTotal cost = Base fee + (Additional charge per megabit * Required data)\n\nTotal cost = $20 + ($0.03 * 500)\n\nTotal cost = $20 + $15\n\nTotal cost = $35\n\nThe optimal plan for the customer would be the one that includes the base fee of $20 and provides 500 megabits of data, with a total cost of $35 per month."
