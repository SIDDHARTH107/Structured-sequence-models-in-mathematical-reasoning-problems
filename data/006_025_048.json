    "message_2": "To find the probability that the performer will hit at least one bullseye during the show, we can first find the probability that they will miss all four attempts and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of missing a single attempt is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.\n\nThe probability of missing all four attempts is 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.00390625.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of hitting at least one bullseye:\n\n1 - 0.00390625 = 0.99609375.\n\nSo, the probability that the performer will hit at least one bullseye during the live stage show is approximately 99.61%."
