    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: chairs and tables. The profit per chair is $30 and the profit per table is $50. Each chair requires 4 hours of labor and each table requires 7 hours of labor. The total labor hours available per day are 120. The factory can only produce a total of 24 products per day. How many units of each product must be produced to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 4x + 7y ≤ 120\n2. Production constraint: x + y ≤ 24\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 30x + 50y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the production constraint for y:\n\ny = 24 - x\n\nNow, substitute this into the labor constraint:\n\n4x + 7(24 - x) ≤ 120\n\nSimplify the inequality:\n\n4x + 168 - 7x ≤ 120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-3x ≤ -48\n\nDivide by -3 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):\n\nx ≥ 16\n\nSo, the factory must produce at least 16 chairs. Now, we will find the corresponding number of tables using the production constraint:\n\ny = 24 - x\ny = 24 - 16\ny = 8\n\nThus, the factory must produce 16 chairs and 8 tables to maximize the profit.\n\nTo verify that this solution maximizes the profit, we can check the profit for producing 15 chairs and 9 tables, and for producing 17 chairs and 7 tables:\n\nP(15, 9) = 30(15) + 50(9) = 450 + 450 = 900\nP(16, 8) = 30(16) + 50(8) = 480 + 400 = 880\nP(17, 7) = 30(17) + 50(7) = 510 + 350 = 860\n\nAs we can see, producing 16 chairs and 8 tables results in the maximum profit of $880."
