    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation (PDE) with the given boundary conditions using Fourier series, we first need to find a suitable transformation. Let's try the following change of variables:\n\n$v(x, y) = u(x, y) - 2y$\n\nNow, the boundary conditions become:\n\n$v(0, y) = 0, \\quad v(x, 0) = -2x, \\quad v(x, 1) = -2x$\n\nThe PDE remains the same:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + 4\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} -3 \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} = 0$\n\nNow, let's assume that the solution can be represented as a product of two functions, one depending on x and the other on y:\n\n$v(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$\n\nSubstituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + 4X'(x)Y'(y) - 3X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + 4\\frac{X'(x)Y'(y)}{X(x)Y(y)} - 3\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nNow, let's separate the variables:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - 3\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -4\\frac{X'(x)Y'(y)}{X(x)Y(y)}$\n\nThe left-hand side depends only on x, and the right-hand side depends only on y. Therefore, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - 3\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -λ$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) $X''(x) + λX(x) = 0$\n\n2) $3Y''(y) + λY(y) = 0$\n\nLet's solve the second ODE first. We have three cases:\n\nCase 1: λ > 0\n\nIn this case, the general solution of the second ODE is:\n\n$Y(y) = A\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\frac{λ}{3}}y) + B\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\frac{λ}{3}}y)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $v(x, 0) = -2x$ and $v(x, 1) = -2x$, we get:\n\n$Y(0) = A\\cosh(0) + B\\sinh(0) = A = 0$\n\n$Y(1) = B\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\frac{λ}{3}}) = 0$\n\nSince $B$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), there is no non-trivial solution in this case.\n\nCase 2: λ = 0\n\nIn this case, the general solution of the second ODE is:\n\n$Y(y) = Ay + B$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$Y(0) = B = 0$\n\n$Y(1) = A = 0$\n\nAgain, there is no non-trivial solution in this case.\n\nCase 3: λ < 0\n\nIn this case, the general solution of the second ODE is:\n\n$Y(y) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{-\\frac{λ}{3}}y) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{-\\frac{λ}{3}}y)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$Y(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$\n\n$Y(1) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{-\\frac{λ}{3}}) = 0$\n\nFor non-trivial solutions, we must have:\n\n$\\sqrt{-\\frac{λ}{3}} = n\\pi \\Rightarrow λ = -3n^2\\pi^2$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nNow, let's solve the first ODE for each λ:\n\n$X''(x) - 3n^2\\pi^2X(x) = 0$\n\nThe general solution is:\n\n$X(x) = C_n\\cos(3n\\pi x) + D_n\\sin(3n\\pi x)$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for v(x, y) as a Fourier series:\n\n$v(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} [C_n\\cos(3n\\pi x) + D_n\\sin(3n\\pi x)]\\sin(n\\pi y)$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $v(0, y) = 0$, we get:\n\n$C_n = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients $D_n$ using the boundary condition $v(x, 0) = -2x$:\n\n$-2x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} D_n\\sin(3n\\pi x)\\sin(0)$\n\nSince $\\sin(0) = 0$, we cannot determine $D_n$ from this boundary condition. However, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions to find $D_n$:\n\n$D_n = -\\frac{2}{\\int_0^1 \\sin^2(3n\\pi x) dx}\\int_0^1 2x\\sin(3n\\pi x) dx$\n\nCalculating the integrals, we get:\n\n$D_n = -\\frac{12}{n\\pi(1 - (-1)^n)}$\n\nFinally, the solution for v(x, y) is:\n\n$v(x, y) = -\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{12}{n\\pi(1 - (-1)^n)}\\sin(3n\\pi x)\\sin(n\\pi y)$\n\nAnd the solution for u(x, y) is:\n\n$u(x, y) = 2y -\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{12}{n\\pi(1 - (-1)^n)}\\sin(3n\\pi x)\\sin(n\\pi y)$\n\nThis is the solution for the given PDE with the specified boundary conditions for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$."
