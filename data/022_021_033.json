    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = (s+2)/(s^2 + 9), we can use the method of partial fraction decomposition. First, we rewrite F(s) as the sum of two fractions:\n\nF(s) = A/(s + 3i) + B/(s - 3i)\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined, and i is the imaginary unit (i^2 = -1). To find A and B, we can clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by (s^2 + 9):\n\ns + 2 = A(s - 3i) + B(s + 3i)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by choosing appropriate values for s. Let's choose s = 3i:\n\n3i + 2 = A(3i - 3i) + B(3i + 3i)\n2 = 6iB\nB = 1/3i\n\nNow, let's choose s = -3i:\n\n-3i + 2 = A(-3i - 3i) + B(-3i + 3i)\n2 = -6iA\nA = -1/3i\n\nNow we have:\n\nF(s) = (-1/3i)/(s + 3i) + (1/3i)/(s - 3i)\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use the fact that the inverse Laplace transform is linear, so we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term separately:\n\nL^(-1){(-1/3i)/(s + 3i)} = (-1/3i)e^(-3it)\nL^(-1){(1/3i)/(s - 3i)} = (1/3i)e^(3it)\n\nNow, we can combine these two terms to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s):\n\nf(t) = L^(-1){F(s)} = (-1/3i)e^(-3it) + (1/3i)e^(3it)\n\nThis is the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = (s+2)/(s^2 + 9)."
