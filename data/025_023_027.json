Suppose that the intersection $Y$ with any irreducible component of $X$ has at worst rational singularities. Let $Z$ be a local complete intersection subvariety of $X$ meeting $Y$ transversely in a subvariety of pure dimension one. Compute the dimension of the cohomology group $H^4_c(Z,\\mathbb{Q})$, where $H^4_c(Z,\\mathbb{Q})$ denotes the cohomology group with compact support.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the cohomology group $H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q})$, we will use the long exact sequence in cohomology with compact support associated to the pair $(Z, Y \\cap Z)$ and the Gysin sequence.\n\nFirst, let's consider the pair $(Z, Y \\cap Z)$. Since $Z$ is a local complete intersection subvariety of $X$ meeting $Y$ transversely in a subvariety of pure dimension one, we have that $Y \\cap Z$ is a local complete intersection subvariety of $Y$ of pure dimension one. By the assumption that the intersection $Y$ with any irreducible component of $X$ has at worst rational singularities, it follows that $Y \\cap Z$ has at worst rational singularities as well.\n\nNow, let's consider the long exact sequence in cohomology with compact support associated to the pair $(Z, Y \\cap Z)$:\n\n$$\\cdots \\to H^3_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4_c(Z, Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nSince $Y \\cap Z$ is a local complete intersection subvariety of $Y$ of pure dimension one, we have that $H^3_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ and $H^4_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$. Thus, the long exact sequence becomes:\n\n$$0 \\to H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4_c(Z, Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to 0$$\n\nThis implies that $H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^4_c(Z, Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nNext, let's consider the Gysin sequence associated to the inclusion $i: Y \\cap Z \\hookrightarrow Z$:\n\n$$\\cdots \\to H^2_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\xrightarrow{i^*} H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H^4_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nSince $H^4_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, we have that $i_*$ is surjective. Thus, the Gysin sequence becomes:\n\n$$\\cdots \\to H^2_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\xrightarrow{i^*} H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to 0$$\n\nThis implies that $H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the image of $i^*: H^2_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q})$. Since $Y \\cap Z$ is a local complete intersection subvariety of $Y$ of pure dimension one with at worst rational singularities, we have that $H^2_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q})$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the cohomology group $H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q})$ is equal to the dimension of the image of $i^*: H^2_c(Y \\cap Z, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4_c(Z, \\mathbb{Q})$, which is a non-negative integer."
