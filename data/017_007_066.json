    "message_2": "To show that G is either isomorphic to C6 or D3, we will use the properties of groups and their elements.\n\nSince the order of G is 6, by the Sylow Theorems, there must be a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2 and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of elements in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n1. If there exists an element of order 6 in G, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C6. This is because a cyclic group of order 6 is generated by an element of order 6.\n\n2. If there is no element of order 6 in G, then the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 3. The identity element has order 1. Since P is a subgroup of order 2, there must be an element of order 2 in G. Let this element be x. Similarly, since Q is a subgroup of order 3, there must be an element of order 3 in G. Let this element be y.\n\nNow, we have the elements x and y with orders 2 and 3, respectively. Since the order of G is 6, there must be 6 distinct elements in G. We can generate these elements by considering the products of x and y:\n\n{e, x, y, y^2, xy, xy^2}\n\nHere, e is the identity element. Note that (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = y^2 since x has order 2. Also, (xy)^3 = xyxyxy = x(yx)yx = x^2y^2 = y^2y = y^3 = e since y has order 3. Therefore, the group G is generated by x and y, and is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 6, it must be either isomorphic to the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
