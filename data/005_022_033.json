    "message_1": "A retailer measured the weights (in pounds) of a sample of 12 watermelons in their store and got the following data: \n42, 39, 40, 47, 45, 50, 48, 41, 43, 46, 44, 51. \nCalculate the median weight, the mean absolute deviation, and the interquartile range.",
    "message_2": "First, let's arrange the data in ascending order:\n39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51\n\n1. Median Weight:\nSince there are 12 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (6th and 7th values).\n\nMedian = (44 + 45) / 2 = 89 / 2 = 44.5 pounds\n\n2. Mean Absolute Deviation:\nFirst, we need to find the mean of the data set.\n\nMean = (39 + 40 + 41 + 42 + 43 + 44 + 45 + 46 + 47 + 48 + 50 + 51) / 12\nMean = 546 / 12 = 45.5\n\nNow, we find the absolute deviation of each data point from the mean and sum them up.\n\n|39 - 45.5| + |40 - 45.5| + |41 - 45.5| + |42 - 45.5| + |43 - 45.5| + |44 - 45.5| + |45 - 45.5| + |46 - 45.5| + |47 - 45.5| + |48 - 45.5| + |50 - 45.5| + |51 - 45.5|\n= 6.5 + 5.5 + 4.5 + 3.5 + 2.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 4.5 + 5.5\n= 38.5\n\nMean Absolute Deviation = 38.5 / 12 = 3.2083 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\n3. Interquartile Range (IQR):\nTo find the IQR, we first need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the overall median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, it's the average of the 3rd and 4th values (41 and 42).\n\nQ1 = (41 + 42) / 2 = 83 / 2 = 41.5\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the overall median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, it's the average of the 9th and 10th values (47 and 48).\n\nQ3 = (47 + 48) / 2 = 95 / 2 = 47.5\n\nNow, we can find the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 47.5 - 41.5 = 6\n\nSo, the median weight is 44.5 pounds, the mean absolute deviation is approximately 3.2083 pounds, and the interquartile range is 6 pounds."
