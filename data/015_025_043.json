    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the oscillation when the system reaches steady-state, we first need to find the steady-state solution of the given forced van der Pol oscillator equation. We can assume a steady-state solution of the form:\n\n$$x(t) = A\\cos(t+\\phi)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude and $\\phi$ is the phase shift. Now, we need to find the first and second derivatives of $x(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = -A\\sin(t+\\phi)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -A\\cos(t+\\phi)$$\n\nSubstitute these derivatives into the given equation:\n\n$$-A\\cos(t+\\phi) + 0.1(1 - (A\\cos(t+\\phi))^2)(-A\\sin(t+\\phi)) + A\\cos(t+\\phi) = \\cos(t)$$\n\nNow, we need to simplify the equation and solve for $A$. Using the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(t+\\phi) = 1 - \\sin^2(t+\\phi)$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$0.1A(1 - (1 - \\sin^2(t+\\phi)))(-A\\sin(t+\\phi)) = \\cos(t) - A\\cos(t+\\phi)$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$0.1A^2\\sin^3(t+\\phi) - 0.1A\\sin(t+\\phi) = \\cos(t) - A\\cos(t+\\phi)$$\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of the trigonometric functions on both sides of the equation:\n\n$$0.1A^2\\sin^3(t+\\phi) - 0.1A\\sin(t+\\phi) = 0$$\n$$\\cos(t) - A\\cos(t+\\phi) = 0$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\n$$A\\cos(t+\\phi) = \\cos(t)$$\n\nSince the amplitude $A$ must be positive, we can square both sides of the equation and use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(t+\\phi) + \\sin^2(t+\\phi) = 1$:\n\n$$A^2 = \\frac{\\cos^2(t)}{\\cos^2(t+\\phi) + \\sin^2(t+\\phi)} = \\frac{\\cos^2(t)}{1} = \\cos^2(t)$$\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find the amplitude $A$:\n\n$$A = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(t)} = |\\cos(t)|$$\n\nSince we are looking for the amplitude of the oscillation when the system reaches steady-state, we can find the maximum value of $|\\cos(t)|$, which is 1. Therefore, the amplitude of the oscillation when the system reaches steady-state is:\n\n$$A = 1$$"
