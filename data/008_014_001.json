    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the QR decomposition method, we first need to rewrite the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\nA = | -2  1 -1 |\n    |  1 -3  2 |\n    |  2  2 -3 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  3 |\n    | -4 |\n    |  0 |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we need to find orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R:\n\n1. Find the orthogonal basis for A:\n\nu1 = a1 = (-2, 1, 2)\nu2 = a2 - proj(u1, a2) = (1, -3, 2) - ((1, -3, 2)·(-2, 1, 2))/((-2, 1, 2)·(-2, 1, 2)) * (-2, 1, 2) = (1, -3, 2) - (-1/3, 1/3, -2/3) = (4/3, -10/3, 8/3)\nu3 = a3 - proj(u1, a3) - proj(u2, a3) = (-1, 2, -3) - ((-1, 2, -3)·(-2, 1, 2))/((-2, 1, 2)·(-2, 1, 2)) * (-2, 1, 2) - ((-1, 2, -3)·(4/3, -10/3, 8/3))/((4/3, -10/3, 8/3)·(4/3, -10/3, 8/3)) * (4/3, -10/3, 8/3) = (-1, 2, -3) - (-1/3, 1/3, -2/3) - (0, 0, 0) = (-2/3, 5/3, -4/3)\n\n2. Normalize the orthogonal basis to get the orthonormal basis:\n\nq1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (-2, 1, 2) / sqrt((-2)^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) = (-2/3, 1/3, 2/3)\nq2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (4/3, -10/3, 8/3) / sqrt((4/3)^2 + (-10/3)^2 + (8/3)^2) = (1/3, -5/3, 2/3)\nq3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (-2/3, 5/3, -4/3) / sqrt((-2/3)^2 + (5/3)^2 + (-4/3)^2) = (-1/3, 2/3, -1/3)\n\nNow we have the orthogonal matrix Q:\n\nQ = | -2/3  1/3 -1/3 |\n    |  1/3 -5/3  2/3 |\n    |  2/3  2/3 -1/3 |\n\nNext, we find the upper triangular matrix R:\n\nR = Q^T * A\n\nR = | -2/3  1/3 -1/3 | * | -2  1 -1 |\n    |  1/3 -5/3  2/3 |   |  1 -3  2 |\n    |  2/3  2/3 -1/3 |   |  2  2 -3 |\n\nR = |  3 -1  2 |\n    |  0  3 -2 |\n    |  0  0  1 |\n\nNow we have A = QR, and we can solve the system Rx = Q^T * b:\n\nQ^T * b = | -2/3  1/3 -1/3 | * |  3 |\n          |  1/3 -5/3  2/3 |   | -4 |\n          |  2/3  2/3 -1/3 |   |  0 |\n\nQ^T * b = | 2 |\n          | 2 |\n          | 1 |\n\nNow we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^T * b:\n\n|  3 -1  2 | | x |   | 2 |\n|  0  3 -2 | | y | = | 2 |\n|  0  0  1 | | z |   | 1 |\n\nFrom the last row, we get z = 1. Now we can substitute z into the second row to find y:\n\n3y - 2z = 2\n3y - 2(1) = 2\n3y = 4\ny = 4/3\n\nFinally, substitute y and z into the first row to find x:\n\n3x - y + 2z = 2\n3x - (4/3) + 2(1) = 2\n3x = 2/3\nx = 2/9\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 2/9\ny = 4/3\nz = 1"
