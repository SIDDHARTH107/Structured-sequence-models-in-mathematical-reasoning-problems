    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral, we first factor the denominator:\n\n$$z^2 - 5z + 6 = (z - 2)(z - 3)$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n$$\\int_{|z|=2}\\frac{1}{(z - 2)(z - 3)} dz$$\n\nSince the contour of integration is the circle centered at the origin with radius 2, the singularities 2 and 3 are located inside and outside the contour, respectively. Therefore, we only need to consider the singularity at z = 2.\n\nWe can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral. The residue theorem states that for a simple closed contour C,\n\n$$\\oint_C f(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\sum_{k=1}^n \\text{Res}(f, a_k)$$\n\nwhere the sum is over all singularities $a_k$ inside the contour C, and Res(f, a_k) is the residue of the function f at the singularity $a_k$.\n\nIn our case, we have only one singularity inside the contour, at z = 2. To find the residue, we can use the formula for simple poles:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f, a) = \\lim_{z \\to a} (z - a) f(z)$$\n\nApplying this formula to our integral, we get:\n\n$$\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{(z - 2)(z - 3)}, 2\\right) = \\lim_{z \\to 2} (z - 2) \\frac{1}{(z - 2)(z - 3)}$$\n\n$$= \\lim_{z \\to 2} \\frac{1}{z - 3} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1$$\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the value of the integral:\n\n$$\\int_{|z|=2}\\frac{1}{z^2 - 5z + 6} dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot (-1) = -2\\pi i$$\n\nSo the value of the integral is $-2\\pi i$."
