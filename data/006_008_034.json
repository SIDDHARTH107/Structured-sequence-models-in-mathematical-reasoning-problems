    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in a week)\n- n choose k is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a given day (0.3)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (no rain) on a given day (0.7)\n- n is the number of trials (7 days in a week)\n- k is the number of successes (3 rainy days)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = (7 choose 3) * 0.3^3 * 0.7^4\n\nFirst, calculate the combinations (7 choose 3):\n\n(7!)/(3!(7-3)!) = (7!)/(3!4!) = (7*6*5)/(3*2*1) = 35\n\nNow, calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 3) = 35 * 0.3^3 * 0.7^4 â‰ˆ 0.2668\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 3 days next week is approximately 0.2668 or 26.68%."
