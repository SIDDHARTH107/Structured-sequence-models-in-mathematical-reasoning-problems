    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a problem:\n\nSuppose Bob wants to send a message to Alice using ElGamal encryption. The prime modulus is 257, while the base is 3. Bob chooses his private key as 11, and computes his public key. He then randomly selects a session key, which turns out to be 13. Bob sends the encrypted message to Alice along with his public key. The encrypted message is (88, 184). Help Alice decrypt the message using her private key (101).",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute Bob's public key. Since the prime modulus is 257 and the base is 3, we can calculate the public key as follows:\n\nPublic key = (base ^ private key) % prime modulus\nPublic key = (3 ^ 11) % 257\nPublic key = 187\n\nNow, let's decrypt the message (88, 184) using Alice's private key (101).\n\n1. Calculate the shared secret:\nShared secret = (public key ^ private key) % prime modulus\nShared secret = (187 ^ 101) % 257\nShared secret = 3\n\n2. Calculate the inverse of the shared secret:\nInverse shared secret = (shared secret ^ (prime modulus - 2)) % prime modulus\nInverse shared secret = (3 ^ (257 - 2)) % 257\nInverse shared secret = 171\n\n3. Decrypt the message:\nDecrypted message = (encrypted message * inverse shared secret) % prime modulus\nDecrypted message = (184 * 171) % 257\nDecrypted message = 72\n\nSo, the decrypted message is 72."
