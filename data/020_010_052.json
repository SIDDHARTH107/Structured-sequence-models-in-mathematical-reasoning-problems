    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit of A is $5 and the profit per unit of B is $8. The company has 100 units of raw material available. Each unit of A requires 2 units of raw material and each unit of B requires 3 units of raw material. Due to uncertainty in the availability of raw material, the company wants to minimize the worst-case profit (also known as \"robust optimization\"). What is the maximum profit the company can earn assuming they adopt a robust optimization approach?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit = 5x + 8y\n\nThe constraints for the raw material are:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 100 (raw material constraint)\n\nx ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo minimize the worst-case profit, we need to find the minimum value of the profit function under these constraints. We can start by finding the feasible region for the problem.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the raw material constraint for y:\n\ny ≤ (100 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by considering the extreme points of the constraints:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 0 (origin)\n2. x = 0, y = 100/3 (intersection of y-axis and raw material constraint)\n3. x = 50, y = 0 (intersection of x-axis and raw material constraint)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. Profit(0, 100/3) = 5(0) + 8(100/3) = $800/3 ≈ $266.67\n3. Profit(50, 0) = 5(50) + 8(0) = $250\n\nThe minimum profit among these vertices is $0, which occurs when the company produces no products. However, this is not a practical solution, as the company would want to produce at least some products to make a profit.\n\nThe next lowest profit is $250, which occurs when the company produces 50 units of product A and no units of product B. This is the maximum profit the company can earn while adopting a robust optimization approach, as it minimizes the worst-case profit while still producing products."
