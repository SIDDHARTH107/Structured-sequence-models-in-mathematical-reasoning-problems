    "message_1": "In a substitution cipher, \"A\" is replaced with \"F\", \"B\" with \"G\", \"C\" with \"H\" and so on until \"Z\" is replaced with \"E\". If the encrypted message reads \"XGKZQF\", what is the original message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to reverse the substitution process. Since \"A\" is replaced with \"F\", we can say that \"F\" is replaced with \"A\". Similarly, \"G\" is replaced with \"B\", \"H\" with \"C\", and so on until \"E\" is replaced with \"Z\". \n\nNow, let's decrypt the message \"XGKZQF\" using this reversed substitution:\n\nX -> S\nG -> B\nK -> F\nZ -> U\nQ -> L\nF -> A\n\nSo, the original message is \"SFBULA\"."
