    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve increases with each iteration.\n\nThe perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter after the 10th iteration. So, n = 10.\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^10)\nPerimeter = 1 * 1024\nPerimeter = 1024 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after the 10th iteration is 1024 units."
