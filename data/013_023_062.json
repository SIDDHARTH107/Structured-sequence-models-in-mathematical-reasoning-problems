Whatever amount Player A sends will be tripled, and then Player B decides how much to return to Player A. If player B returns $X, how much money did Player A send?\n\nFor example, if Player A sends $3 and Player B decides to send back $5, then the total amount of money in the game is $8.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount Player A sends as \"a\" and the amount Player B returns as \"x\". According to the problem, the amount sent by Player A is tripled before Player B receives it. So, Player B receives 3a dollars.\n\nNow, we are given that Player B returns x dollars to Player A. We need to find the value of \"a\" in terms of \"x\".\n\nSince Player B returns x dollars from the 3a dollars they received, they keep (3a - x) dollars for themselves.\n\nThe total amount of money in the game after the transactions is the sum of the money held by both players, which is:\n\nTotal amount = (10 - a) + (3a - x)\n\nWe are given that the total amount of money in the game is 8 dollars. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n8 = (10 - a) + (3a - x)\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"a\" in terms of \"x\":\n\n8 = 10 - a + 3a - x\n8 = 10 + 2a - x\n2a - x = -2\na = (x - 2) / 2\n\nSo, the amount Player A sends, \"a\", is equal to (x - 2) / 2."
