    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by iteratively applying a simple rule to an initial line segment. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nLet's denote the length of the initial line segment as L0 = 3 units. After the first iteration, the length of the curve will be L1 = (4/3) * L0. After the second iteration, the length will be L2 = (4/3) * L1, and after the third iteration, the length will be L3 = (4/3) * L2.\n\nTo find the length of the curve after 3 iterations, we can calculate L3 as follows:\n\nL1 = (4/3) * L0 = (4/3) * 3 = 4\nL2 = (4/3) * L1 = (4/3) * 4 = 16/3\nL3 = (4/3) * L2 = (4/3) * (16/3) = 64/9\n\nSo, the length of the Koch snowflake curve after 3 iterations is 64/9 units, or approximately 7.111 units."
