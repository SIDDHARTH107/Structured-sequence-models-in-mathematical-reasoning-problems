    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted as χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn this problem, we have a graph G with 8 vertices and 13 edges. To find the chromatic index, we can use Vizing's Theorem, which states that for any simple, undirected graph G, the chromatic index χ'(G) is either equal to the maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1, i.e., χ'(G) ∈ {Δ(G), Δ(G) + 1}.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph. Since the graph has 13 edges and 8 vertices, the average degree is (2 * 13) / 8 = 26 / 8 = 3.25. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 4.\n\nNow, we need to check if we can properly color the edges of the graph using Δ(G) = 4 colors or if we need Δ(G) + 1 = 5 colors. Since we don't have the actual graph, we can't determine the exact chromatic index. However, we can conclude that the chromatic index χ'(G) is either 4 or 5, i.e., χ'(G) ∈ {4, 5}."
