    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5} be two sets. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the complement of the symmetric difference. Next, find the complement of set A and the complement of set B. Finally, show that the symmetric difference of the complements is not equal to the complement of the symmetric difference, thereby proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference of A and B, we take the elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. The symmetric difference of A and B is:\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's assume a universal set U that contains all the elements in A and B. For simplicity, let's take U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We will find the complement of the symmetric difference:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {2, 3, 6}\n\nNow, we will find the complement of set A and the complement of set B:\n\nA' = U - A = {4, 5, 6}\nB' = U - B = {1, 6}\n\nNow, we will find the symmetric difference of the complements:\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4, 5}\n\nComparing the symmetric difference of the complements (A' ∆ B' = {1, 4, 5}) with the complement of the symmetric difference ((A ∆ B)' = {2, 3, 6}), we can see that they are not equal.\n\nThus, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
