    "message_2": "The trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot, and its knot type can be determined by its crossing number. The crossing number is the minimum number of crossings in any diagram of the knot. For the trefoil knot, the crossing number is 3. This means that the trefoil knot is a 3_1 knot in the standard notation for knots, where the first number represents the crossing number and the second number distinguishes between different knots with the same crossing number."
