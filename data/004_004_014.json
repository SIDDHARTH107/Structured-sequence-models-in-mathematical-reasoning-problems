    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 between x = 0 and x = 2, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 2.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 1) dx = (x^3/3) + x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 2:\n\n[(2^3/3) + 2] - [(0^3/3) + 0] = (8/3) + 2\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\n(8/3) + (6/3) = 14/3\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 between x = 0 and x = 2 is 14/3 square units."
