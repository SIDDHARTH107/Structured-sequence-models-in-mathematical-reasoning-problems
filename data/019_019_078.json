    "message_2": "To determine the smallest positive integer that cannot be computed using a Turing machine with a single tape that starts with a blank tape and halts after exactly 2021 steps, we need to consider the number of possible configurations a Turing machine can have within 2021 steps.\n\nA Turing machine consists of a finite set of states, an input alphabet, a tape alphabet, a transition function, and a set of final states. In this case, the input alphabet is a blank tape, and the Turing machine has a single tape.\n\nLet's assume the Turing machine has k states and a tape alphabet of size b. The maximum number of configurations a Turing machine can have within 2021 steps is given by the product of the number of states, the number of tape alphabet symbols, and the number of steps: k * b * 2021.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer that cannot be computed, we need to find the smallest k and b such that k * b * 2021 is greater than the desired integer. Since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we can start with k = 1 and b = 2 (binary alphabet).\n\n1 * 2 * 2021 = 4042\n\nThis means that a Turing machine with a single tape, starting with a blank tape, and halting after exactly 2021 steps can have at most 4042 different configurations. However, not all of these configurations will result in a unique positive integer, as some may be invalid or represent the same number.\n\nGiven the large number of possible configurations, it is difficult to determine the exact smallest positive integer that cannot be computed. However, we can safely say that the smallest positive integer that cannot be computed will be greater than the number of valid configurations, which is less than or equal to 4042."
