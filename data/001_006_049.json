    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the parabola y = x^2 + 6x + 8, we can use the vertex formula for a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, which is:\n\nVertex: (h, k) = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 8.\n\nFirst, let's find h:\nh = -b/2a = -6/(2*1) = -6/2 = -3\n\nNow, let's find the value of y (k) when x = h:\nk = f(-3) = (-3)^2 + 6*(-3) + 8 = 9 - 18 + 8 = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-3, -1)."
