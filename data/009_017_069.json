    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a distance of 3m from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, this is represented as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 3m from the wire, we can consider a circular loop of radius 3m centered on the wire. The magnetic field strength will be constant along this loop.\n\nLet's denote the magnetic field strength as B, the distance from the wire as r (which is 3m in this case), and the length of the circular loop as the circumference of the circle, which is 2πr. The closed line integral of the magnetic field around the loop is B times the circumference of the circle:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B(2πr)\n\nNow, we can apply Ampere's Law:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nWe are given the current I = 5A, and the permeability of free space μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. We want to find the magnetic field strength B at a distance r = 3m from the wire. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB(2π × 3) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)(5A)\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)(5A) / (2π × 3)\n\nB ≈ (2 × 10^(-7) Tm/A)(5A)\n\nB ≈ 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 3m from the wire is approximately 10^(-6) Tesla."
