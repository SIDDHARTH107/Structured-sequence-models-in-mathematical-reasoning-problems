Project A has a potential return of $20,000 and requires an investment of $45,000, while project B has a potential return of $16,000 and requires an investment of $35,000. How much money should the company invest in each project in order to maximize their potential return?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the potential return, we need to calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each project. The ROI is calculated as (potential return / investment required).\n\nROI for Project A:\nROI_A = $20,000 / $45,000 = 0.4444 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nROI for Project B:\nROI_B = $16,000 / $35,000 = 0.4571 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nProject B has a higher ROI, so the company should prioritize investing in Project B. However, since the company has a budget of $100,000, they can invest in both projects.\n\nInvestment in Project A: $45,000\nInvestment in Project B: $35,000\n\nAfter investing in both projects, the company will have $100,000 - $45,000 - $35,000 = $20,000 remaining in their budget. Since Project B has a higher ROI, the company should invest the remaining $20,000 in Project B.\n\nFinal investment:\nProject A: $45,000\nProject B: $35,000 + $20,000 = $55,000"
