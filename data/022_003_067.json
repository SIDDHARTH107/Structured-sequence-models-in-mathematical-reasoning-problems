    "message_2": "To evaluate the contour integral, we will use the residue theorem. The residue theorem states that for a simple closed contour C and a function f(z) with isolated singularities inside C,\n\n$$\\oint_C f(z)dz = 2\\pi i \\sum_{k=1}^n \\operatorname{Res}(f, a_k)$$\n\nwhere the sum is over the residues of f(z) at its singularities $a_k$ inside C.\n\nThe function $f(z) = \\frac{z^3}{(z-1)(z-2)}$ has singularities at $z = 1$ and $z = 2$. Since the contour C is the unit circle centered at the origin, only the singularity at $z = 1$ is inside the contour.\n\nTo find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z = 1$, we can use the formula for the residue of a simple pole:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Res}(f, a) = \\lim_{z \\to a} (z - a) f(z)$$\n\nIn our case, $a = 1$, so we have:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Res}(f, 1) = \\lim_{z \\to 1} (z - 1) \\frac{z^3}{(z-1)(z-2)}$$\n\nThe $(z-1)$ term cancels out, leaving:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Res}(f, 1) = \\lim_{z \\to 1} \\frac{z^3}{(z-2)}$$\n\nEvaluating the limit, we get:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Res}(f, 1) = \\frac{1^3}{(1-2)} = -1$$\n\nNow we can apply the residue theorem:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{z^3}{(z-1)(z-2)}dz = 2\\pi i \\operatorname{Res}(f, 1) = 2\\pi i (-1) = -2\\pi i$$\n\nSo the contour integral is equal to $-2\\pi i$."
