    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a simple undirected graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and the number of edges does not exceed n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, the graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. The minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is (10-1) = 9 edges. Since 15 > 9, the graph could be connected. However, we need to check if the number of edges does not exceed the maximum possible number of edges for a simple undirected graph with 10 vertices, which is 10(10-1)/2 = 45 edges. Since 15 < 45, the graph is connected.\n\nTherefore, the given graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges is connected. There is only one connected component, and its size is equal to the total number of vertices, which is 10."
