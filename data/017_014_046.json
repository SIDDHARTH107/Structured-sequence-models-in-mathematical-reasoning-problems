    "message_2": "To find all distinct groups of order 20 up to isomorphism, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of a group G is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5. Thus, we are looking for the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possibilities are n_5 = 1 or n_5 = 4.\n\nNow we can classify the groups based on their Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G, G is the direct product of P_2 and P_5, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_5. P_2 can be either C_4 (cyclic) or C_2 × C_2 (Klein four-group), and P_5 is always C_5 (cyclic). So, we have two possibilities: G ≅ C_4 × C_5 or G ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_5.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 4, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_5, i.e., G ≅ P_2 ⋊ P_5. P_2 can be either C_4 (cyclic) or C_2 × C_2 (Klein four-group). If P_2 is C_4, then G is the dihedral group D_20. If P_2 is C_2 × C_2, then G is a non-abelian group called the quaternion group Q_20.\n\nIn summary, we have four distinct groups of order 20 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. G ≅ C_4 × C_5 (cyclic)\n2. G ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_5 (cyclic)\n3. G ≅ D_20 (dihedral)\n4. G ≅ Q_20 (non-abelian)"
