    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve that is constructed through an iterative process. Each iteration increases the number of line segments and the total length of the curve. \n\nIn the first iteration, there are 3 line segments, each with a length of 1 unit. So, the total length is 3 units.\n\nIn each subsequent iteration, each line segment is replaced by a copy of the entire curve from the previous iteration, scaled down by a factor of 3. This means that the number of line segments in the curve is multiplied by 3 with each iteration.\n\nLet's calculate the length of the Peano curve for the first 4 iterations:\n\nIteration 1: 3 line segments (3 units)\nIteration 2: 3 * 3 = 9 line segments (9 units)\nIteration 3: 9 * 3 = 27 line segments (27 units)\nIteration 4: 27 * 3 = 81 line segments (81 units)\n\nAfter the first 4 iterations, the Peano curve has a total length of 81 units."
