    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 6 and let a be an element of order 6 in G. Since the order of a is 6, we have a^6 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Now, consider the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>. This subgroup contains the elements {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}. Since a has order 6, all these elements are distinct. Therefore, the cyclic subgroup <a> has 6 elements.\n\nSince the order of G is also 6, we have |G| = |<a>|. This implies that G = <a>, which means G is a cyclic group generated by a. The cyclic group of order 6, C6, is generated by an element b with order 6, and its elements are {e, b, b^2, b^3, b^4, b^5}.\n\nNow, we define a function φ: G → C6 as follows: φ(a^i) = b^i for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We will show that φ is an isomorphism between G and C6.\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since a has order 6, the elements a^i for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are distinct, and similarly for the elements b^i in C6. Thus, φ is well-defined.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let x = a^i and y = a^j be elements in G. Then, φ(xy) = φ(a^i * a^j) = φ(a^(i+j)) = b^(i+j) = b^i * b^j = φ(a^i) * φ(a^j) = φ(x) * φ(y). Therefore, φ is a homomorphism.\n\n3. φ is injective (one-to-one): Suppose φ(a^i) = φ(a^j) for some i, j with 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 5. Then b^i = b^j, which implies i = j (since b has order 6). Thus, φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective (onto): For any element b^i in C6, there exists an element a^i in G such that φ(a^i) = b^i. Therefore, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism between G and C6. Thus, the group G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6."
