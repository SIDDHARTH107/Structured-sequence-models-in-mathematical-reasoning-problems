    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. Since we know one angle and the lengths of the two sides adjacent to that angle, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, let's consider the angle of 55 degrees as angle C, and the sides of length 6 meters and 8 meters as sides a and b, respectively. We want to find the length of side c.\n\nc^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 - 2 * 6 * 8 * cos(55)\nc^2 = 36 + 64 - 96 * cos(55)\nc^2 ≈ 100 - 55.4256\nc^2 ≈ 44.5744\nc ≈ √44.5744\nc ≈ 6.678\n\nNow that we have the length of the third side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = 6 + 8 + 6.678 ≈ 20.678 meters"
