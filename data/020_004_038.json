    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to optimize its production process by minimizing the cost of producing two types of products, Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 4 units of resource 1 and 3 units of resource 2, while the production of Product B requires 2 units of resource 1 and 5 units of resource 2. The cost of producing one unit of Product A is $10 and the cost of producing one unit of Product B is $15. The company has a total of 40 units of resource 1 and 35 units of resource 2 available for production. \n\nWhat is the optimal production quantity of Product A and Product B that will minimize the production cost of the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the total cost:\nC(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nThe constraints are based on the available resources:\n4x + 2y ≤ 40 (resource 1)\n3x + 5y ≤ 35 (resource 2)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints for y:\ny ≤ (40 - 4x)/2\ny ≤ (35 - 3x)/5\n\nNow we will find the corner points of the feasible region by setting the inequalities to equalities and solving for x and y:\n1. x = 0, y = (40 - 4x)/2 => y = 20\n2. x = 0, y = (35 - 3x)/5 => y = 7\n3. y = 0, x = (40 - 2y)/4 => x = 10\n4. Intersection of 4x + 2y = 40 and 3x + 5y = 35:\n   4x + 2y = 40 => y = 20 - 2x\n   3x + 5(20 - 2x) = 35 => x = 5, y = 10\n\nSo, the corner points of the feasible region are (0, 20), (0, 7), (10, 0), and (5, 10).\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\nC(0, 20) = 10(0) + 15(20) = $300\nC(0, 7) = 10(0) + 15(7) = $105\nC(10, 0) = 10(10) + 15(0) = $100\nC(5, 10) = 10(5) + 15(10) = $200\n\nThe minimum cost is $100, which occurs when producing 10 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B."
