    "message_1": "In a basketball game, a player has a 70% chance of making a free throw. If the player takes 10 free throws, what is the probability that they will make exactly 7 of them?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of making exactly x free throws, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as nCx), p is the probability of making a free throw (0.7 in this case), and n is the total number of free throws taken (10 in this case).\n\nWe want to find the probability of making exactly 7 free throws, so we'll plug in x = 7:\n\nP(7) = C(10, 7) * 0.7^7 * (1-0.7)^(10-7)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 free throws from 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / (5040 * 6)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / 30240\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the formula:\n\nP(7) = 120 * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3\n\nCalculate the powers:\n\nP(7) = 120 * 0.0823543 * 0.027\n\nFinally, multiply everything together:\n\nP(7) ≈ 120 * 0.0823543 * 0.027 ≈ 0.2668\n\nSo, the probability of the player making exactly 7 free throws out of 10 is approximately 26.68%."
