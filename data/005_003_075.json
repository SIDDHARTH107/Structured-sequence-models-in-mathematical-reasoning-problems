Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the linear regression line, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) of the line. The equation of the line will be in the form y = mx + b, where y represents the height (in inches) and x represents the weight (in pounds).\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the weights (x̄) and the mean of the heights (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (140 + 150 + 160 + 170 + 180 + 190 + 200 + 210 + 220 + 230) / 10 = 1850 / 10 = 185\n\nȳ = (65 + 67 + 68 + 70 + 72 + 73 + 75 + 76 + 78 + 80) / 10 = 724 / 10 = 72.4\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (m). We can use the following formula:\n\nm = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = (140-185)(65-72.4) + (150-185)(67-72.4) + ... + (230-185)(80-72.4) = -45(-7.4) - 35(-5.4) - 25(-4.4) - 15(-2.4) - 5(-0.4) + 5(0.6) + 15(2.6) + 25(3.6) + 35(5.6) + 45(7.6) = 3330 + 1890 + 1100 + 360 + 20 + 30 + 390 + 900 + 1960 + 3420 = 13500\n\nDenominator = Σ(xi - x̄)^2 = (-45)^2 + (-35)^2 + (-25)^2 + (-15)^2 + (-5)^2 + 5^2 + 15^2 + 25^2 + 35^2 + 45^2 = 2025 + 1225 + 625 + 225 + 25 + 25 + 225 + 625 + 1225 + 2025 = 7225\n\nNow, we can find the slope (m):\n\nm = 13500 / 7225 = 1.868\n\nFinally, we need to find the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄ = 72.4 - 1.868 * 185 = 72.4 - 345.58 = -273.18\n\nSo, the linear regression line for predicting the height (in inches) based on the weight (in pounds) is:\n\ny = 1.868x - 273.18\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the equation becomes:\n\ny = 1.87x - 273.18"
