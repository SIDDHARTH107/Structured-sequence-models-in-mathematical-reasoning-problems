    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 1$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 7x - 1$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 7$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we can find the Jacobian matrix at the point $(1, \\sqrt{9}) = (1, 3)$:\n\n$J_F(1, 3) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(1, 3) & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(1, 3) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -3(1)^2 - 7 & 2(3) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -10 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSo, the Jacobian of the curve at the point $(1, \\sqrt{9})$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} -10 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$."
