    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the fuzzy set A ∩ B, we need to find the intersection of the two fuzzy sets A and B. The intersection of two fuzzy sets is defined as the minimum of the membership functions of the two sets for each element in the universe of discourse.\n\nA(x) = {0.3/30, 0.6/60, 0.9/90}\nB(x) = {0.2/50, 0.4/70, 0.8/90}\n\nLet's find the intersection A ∩ B:\n\nA ∩ B(x) = min(A(x), B(x))\n\nFor x = 30, A(30) = 0.3, but B(30) is not defined. So, we cannot find the intersection at x = 30.\n\nFor x = 50, A(50) is not defined, but B(50) = 0.2. So, we cannot find the intersection at x = 50.\n\nFor x = 60, A(60) = 0.6, but B(60) is not defined. So, we cannot find the intersection at x = 60.\n\nFor x = 70, A(70) is not defined, but B(70) = 0.4. So, we cannot find the intersection at x = 70.\n\nFor x = 90, A(90) = 0.9 and B(90) = 0.8. So, the intersection at x = 90 is:\n\nA ∩ B(90) = min(A(90), B(90)) = min(0.9, 0.8) = 0.8\n\nSince we have only one intersection point, the maximum value of the fuzzy set A ∩ B in terms of the membership function is 0.8 at x = 90."
