    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal object created by iteratively removing cubes from the original cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube and the six cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes in each iteration.\n\nThe volume of the original cube is V = a^3, where a is the length of the cube. In this case, a = 3 cm, so the original volume is V = 3^3 = 27 cubic centimeters.\n\nAfter the first iteration, 1/3 of the volume is removed (7 of the 27 smaller cubes). The remaining volume is (2/3) * V.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the 20 remaining cubes undergoes the same process, so the remaining volume is (2/3)^2 * (20/27) * V.\n\nAfter the third iteration, the remaining volume is (2/3)^3 * (20/27)^2 * V.\n\nAfter the fourth iteration, the remaining volume is (2/3)^4 * (20/27)^3 * V.\n\nPlugging in the original volume, we get:\n\n(2/3)^4 * (20/27)^3 * 27 = (16/81) * (8000/19683) * 27 â‰ˆ 8.610 cubic centimeters.\n\nSo, the volume of the Menger sponge after the 4th iteration is approximately 8.610 cubic centimeters."
