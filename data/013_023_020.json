    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A is given $10 and must decide how much to share with Player B. Player B then receives the shared amount and must decide how much, if any, to return to Player A. Whatever is returned is tripled and given back to Player A. If Player B decides to keep all the money, then neither player receives anything. \n\nSuppose Player A decides to share $4 with Player B. How much would Player B need to return to Player A in order to maximize their combined payoffs?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount Player B returns to Player A as x. Since Player A initially shares $4 with Player B, Player B has $4 to work with. Therefore, 0 ≤ x ≤ 4.\n\nWhen Player B returns x dollars to Player A, the returned amount is tripled, so Player A receives 3x dollars. The total payoff for Player A is then the initial $10 minus the $4 shared, plus the 3x dollars received, which is 6 + 3x.\n\nPlayer B's payoff is the $4 received from Player A minus the x dollars returned, which is 4 - x.\n\nThe combined payoffs for both players is the sum of their individual payoffs: (6 + 3x) + (4 - x) = 10 + 2x.\n\nTo maximize the combined payoffs, we need to maximize the value of 2x, given the constraint 0 ≤ x ≤ 4. The maximum value of 2x occurs when x = 4, which results in a combined payoff of 10 + 2(4) = 18.\n\nSo, Player B should return all $4 to Player A in order to maximize their combined payoffs."
