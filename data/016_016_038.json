    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is constructed iteratively. In each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 7 compared to the previous iteration.\n\nTo find the number of segments in the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of segments = 7^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of segments = 7^5 = 16807\n\nSo, there are 16,807 segments in the 5th iteration of the Gosper curve."
