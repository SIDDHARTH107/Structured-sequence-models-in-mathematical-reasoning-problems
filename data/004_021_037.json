    "message_2": "To find the second derivative, we first need to find the first derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x - 16.\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), is found by taking the derivative of each term with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = (3x^2) - (18x) + 24\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = (6x) - 18\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 3:\n\nf''(3) = (6 * 3) - 18 = 18 - 18 = 0\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) at x = 3 is 0."
