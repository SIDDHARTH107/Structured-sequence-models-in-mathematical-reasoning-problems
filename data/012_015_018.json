    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges.\n\nIn this case, we have 9 vertices, so a connected graph must have at least 9-1 = 8 edges. Since our graph has 11 edges, which is more than the minimum required, it is possible for the graph to be connected.\n\nHowever, having more than the minimum required number of edges does not guarantee that the graph is connected. To determine if the graph is connected, we would need more information about the specific connections between the vertices."
