    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using block matrices, we first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3  5 | 7\n| 4  5  6 | 8\n| 6  7  8 | 9\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2:\n\n| 1  1.5  2.5 | 3.5\n| 4  5    6   | 8\n| 6  7    8   | 9\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1.5  2.5 | 3.5\n| 0 -1   -4   |-6\n| 0  1    2   | 0\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by -1:\n\n| 1  1.5  2.5 | 3.5\n| 0  1    4   | 6\n| 0  1    2   | 0\n\nStep 4: Subtract the second row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1.5  2.5 | 3.5\n| 0  1    4   | 6\n| 0  0   -2   |-6\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -2:\n\n| 1  1.5  2.5 | 3.5\n| 0  1    4   | 6\n| 0  0    1   | 3\n\nNow, we perform back-substitution to find the solutions (x, y, z):\n\nz = 3\ny + 4z = 6 => y = 6 - 4(3) = -6\nx + 1.5y + 2.5z = 3.5 => x = 3.5 - 1.5(-6) - 2.5(3) = 1\n\nSo, the solution is (x, y, z) = (1, -6, 3)."
