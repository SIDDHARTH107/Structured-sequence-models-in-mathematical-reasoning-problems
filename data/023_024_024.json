    "message_2": "Since the function f(x) has a periodic discontinuity at x = 0, we can assume that the function is odd. This means that the Fourier series will only contain sine terms. The period of the function is 2L. Let's find the Fourier series of the function f(x) expanded over the interval -L to L.\n\nThe general form of the Fourier series for an odd function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nTo find the coefficients b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx, integrated over the interval -L to L.\n\nSince f(x) = x for x > 0 and f(x) = -x for x < 0, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * [∫[-x * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx from -L to 0 + ∫[x * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx from 0 to L]\n\nNow, let's solve the integrals:\n\nFor the first integral, let's substitute u = -x:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * [∫[u * sin(n * π * (-u) / L)](-du) from L to 0 + ∫[x * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx from 0 to L]\n\nb_n = (2/L) * [-∫[u * sin(n * π * u / L)]du from 0 to L + ∫[x * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx from 0 to L]\n\nNow, we can combine the integrals:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[(x - u) * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx from 0 to L\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet v = x - u, dv = dx\nLet w = sin(n * π * x / L), dw = (n * π / L) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫v * dw = v * w - ∫w * dv\n\nb_n = (2/L) * [(x - u) * (-cos(n * π * x / L) * L / (n * π)) from 0 to L - ∫(-cos(n * π * x / L) * L / (n * π))dx from 0 to L]\n\nb_n = (2/L) * [(-L * cos(n * π * x / L) / (n * π)) from 0 to L + (L / (n * π)) * ∫cos(n * π * x / L)dx from 0 to L]\n\nNow, let's solve the remaining integral:\n\n∫cos(n * π * x / L)dx = (L / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / L) + C\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * [(-L * cos(n * π * x / L) / (n * π)) from 0 to L + (L / (n * π)) * (L / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / L) from 0 to L]\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * [(-L * cos(n * π) / (n * π) + L * cos(0) / (n * π)) + (L^2 / (n^2 * π^2)) * (sin(n * π) - sin(0))]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n and sin(n * π) = 0:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * [(-L * (-1)^n / (n * π) + L / (n * π))]\n\nb_n = (2 * L / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the function f(x):\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2 * L / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series of the function f(x) expanded over the interval -L to L, where L is the period of the function."
