Assume that the selling price is dependent on the production quantity and follows a linear demand curve with an intercept of 100 and a slope of -0.05.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the expected cost of producing 1000 units of a product, we need to consider the relationship between production cost, selling price, and the demand curve. We are given the following information:\n\n1. Production cost follows a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 5.\n2. Selling price follows a normal distribution with mean 80 and standard deviation 10.\n3. The selling price is dependent on the production quantity and follows a linear demand curve with an intercept of 100 and a slope of -0.05.\n\nFirst, let's find the expected selling price (ESP) for 1000 units using the linear demand curve:\n\nESP = 100 - 0.05 * 1000 = 100 - 50 = 50\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal production cost (OPC) that minimizes the expected cost. Since the production cost follows a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 5, we can use the following formula to calculate the probability density function (PDF) of the production cost:\n\nPDF(x) = (1 / (5 * sqrt(2 * pi))) * exp(-((x - 50)^2) / (2 * 5^2))\n\nTo minimize the expected cost, we need to find the value of x (production cost) that maximizes the PDF(x) * (ESP - x). We can do this by taking the derivative of the function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(PDF(x) * (ESP - x)) / dx = 0\n\nSolving this equation, we find that the optimal production cost (OPC) is approximately 50. This means that the expected cost is minimized when the production cost is equal to the mean of the normal distribution (50).\n\nIn conclusion, to minimize the expected cost of producing 1000 units of a product, the optimal solution is to produce the product at a cost of approximately 50 per unit."
