    "message_2": "In Morse homology, the rank of the homology groups is determined by the number of critical points of the Morse function with a given index. In this case, we have one critical point of index 0, one critical point of index 1, and one critical point of index 2.\n\nRecall that the rank of a homology group is the number of its generators. Since we are working with coefficients in Z2, the homology groups will be vector spaces over Z2.\n\nThe rank of H0(X) is 1, as there is one critical point of index 0, which corresponds to a generator of H0(X). Similarly, the rank of H1(X) is 1, as there is one critical point of index 1, which corresponds to a generator of H1(X).\n\nNow, let's consider H2(X). There is one critical point of index 2, which corresponds to a generator of H2(X). Therefore, the rank of H2(X) is 1.\n\nSo, the rank of the second homology group H2(X) is 1."
