    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. The Descartes Circle Theorem states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4, the following equation holds:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nGiven the initial curvatures of the three mutually tangent circles as 1, 2, and 3, we can find the curvature of the fourth circle using the Descartes Circle Theorem. Let k4 be the curvature of the fourth circle:\n\n(1 + 2 + 3 + k4)^2 = 2(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + k4^2)\n\nSolving for k4:\n\n(6 + k4)^2 = 2(1 + 4 + 9 + k4^2)\n36 + 12k4 + k4^2 = 28 + 2k4^2\n8 = 12k4 - k4^2\nk4^2 - 12k4 + 8 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for k4:\n\nk4 = (12 ± sqrt(12^2 - 4 * 8)) / 2\nk4 = (12 ± sqrt(128)) / 2\n\nThere are two possible values for k4: one for the circle inside the initial three circles (k4 = 6 - sqrt(32)) and one for the circle outside the initial three circles (k4 = 6 + sqrt(32)). We are interested in the inner circle, so we take the smaller value:\n\nk4 = 6 - sqrt(32) ≈ 0.431\n\nNow, we need to find the total curvature of the Apollonian gasket. The total curvature is the sum of the curvatures of all the circles in the gasket. The gasket is a fractal, and its total curvature is the sum of an infinite geometric series. The common ratio of this series is the ratio of the curvatures of successive circles, which is (6 - sqrt(32)) / 6 ≈ 0.0718.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\nSum = a / (1 - r)\n\nwhere a is the first term (the sum of the initial curvatures) and r is the common ratio:\n\nSum = (1 + 2 + 3) / (1 - 0.0718)\nSum ≈ 6 / 0.9282\nSum ≈ 6.464\n\nThe total curvature of the Apollonian gasket is approximately 6.46 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)."
