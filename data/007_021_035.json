    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 225225 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random starting point x0 and a function f(x). A common choice for f(x) is f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n2. Generate a sequence of numbers using the function f(x) and the previous number in the sequence: x1 = f(x0), x2 = f(x1), x3 = f(x2), and so on.\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between two numbers in the sequence and the original number (225225). If the GCD is not 1, then it is a factor of the original number.\n\nLet's start with x0 = 2 and f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n\n1. x1 = f(x0) = f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\n2. x2 = f(x1) = f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\n3. x3 = f(x2) = f(26) = 26^2 + 1 = 677\n\nNow, we calculate the GCD of the absolute differences and 225225:\n\n1. GCD(|5 - 2|, 225225) = GCD(3, 225225) = 3\n2. GCD(|26 - 5|, 225225) = GCD(21, 225225) = 3\n3. GCD(|677 - 26|, 225225) = GCD(651, 225225) = 3\n\nIn this case, the smallest prime factor of 225225 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 3."
