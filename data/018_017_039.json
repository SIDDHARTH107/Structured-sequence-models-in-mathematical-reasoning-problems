    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. (A x B) x {1}:\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of (A x B) with {1}:\n(A x B) x {1} = {((1,2),1), ((1,3),1), ((1,4),1), ((2,2),1), ((2,3),1), ((2,4),1), ((3,2),1), ((3,3),1), ((3,4),1)}\n\n2. A x (B x {1}):\nB x {1} = {(2,1), (3,1), (4,1)}\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of A with (B x {1}):\nA x (B x {1}) = {(1,(2,1)), (1,(3,1)), (1,(4,1)), (2,(2,1)), (2,(3,1)), (2,(4,1)), (3,(2,1)), (3,(3,1)), (3,(4,1))}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between the two sets. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n\nSymmetric Difference = {((1,2),1), ((1,3),1), ((1,4),1), ((2,2),1), ((2,3),1), ((2,4),1), ((3,2),1), ((3,3),1), ((3,4),1)} âˆ† {(1,(2,1)), (1,(3,1)), (1,(4,1)), (2,(2,1)), (2,(3,1)), (2,(4,1)), (3,(2,1)), (3,(3,1)), (3,(4,1))}\n\nThe symmetric difference is the union of the two sets minus their intersection. In this case, the intersection is empty, so the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n\nSymmetric Difference = {((1,2),1), ((1,3),1), ((1,4),1), ((2,2),1), ((2,3),1), ((2,4),1), ((3,2),1), ((3,3),1), ((3,4),1), (1,(2,1)), (1,(3,1)), (1,(4,1)), (2,(2,1)), (2,(3,1)), (2,(4,1)), (3,(2,1)), (3,(3,1)), (3,(4,1))}\n\nSince the symmetric difference is not an empty set, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to the symmetric difference."
