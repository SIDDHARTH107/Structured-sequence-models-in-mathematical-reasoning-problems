    "message_2": "To determine the spectrum of the signal x(t) with a square pulse of width T = 2 seconds and a sampling frequency of 10 Hz, we first need to define the signal x(t) and then apply the Fourier transform.\n\nThe square pulse can be represented as:\n\nx(t) = { 1, for 0 <= t < T\n         0, otherwise\n\nGiven T = 2 seconds, the signal x(t) is:\n\nx(t) = { 1, for 0 <= t < 2\n         0, otherwise\n\nNow, we apply the Fourier transform to x(t) to obtain its spectrum X(f). The Fourier transform of a square pulse is given by the sinc function:\n\nX(f) = ∫ x(t) * e^(-j * 2 * π * f * t) dt\n\nFor the given square pulse, the Fourier transform becomes:\n\nX(f) = ∫[0 to 2] e^(-j * 2 * π * f * t) dt\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nX(f) = [-1/(j * 2 * π * f)] * e^(-j * 2 * π * f * t) | [0 to 2]\n\nX(f) = [-1/(j * 2 * π * f)] * [e^(-j * 4 * π * f) - 1]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression using the sinc function:\n\nX(f) = 2 * sinc(2 * π * f * T)\n\nSince T = 2 seconds, the spectrum becomes:\n\nX(f) = 2 * sinc(4 * π * f)\n\nNow, we need to consider the sampling frequency, which is 10 Hz. To obtain the discrete-time Fourier transform, we sample the continuous-time spectrum X(f) at intervals of the sampling frequency:\n\nX[k] = X(k * f_s), where k is an integer and f_s is the sampling frequency.\n\nIn this case, f_s = 10 Hz, so:\n\nX[k] = 2 * sinc(4 * π * k * 10)\n\nThis is the spectrum of the signal x(t) with a square pulse of width T = 2 seconds and a sampling frequency of 10 Hz."
