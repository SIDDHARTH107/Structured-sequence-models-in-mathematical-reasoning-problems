    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x - 3| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 3 â‰¥ 0\nIn this case, we can remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n2x - 3 = 7\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nCase 2: 2x - 3 < 0\nIn this case, we need to negate the expression inside the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n-(2x - 3) = 7\n-2x + 3 = 7\n-2x = 4\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 5 and -2."
