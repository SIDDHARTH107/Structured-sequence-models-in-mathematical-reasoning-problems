    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 18. Since 18 is not a prime number, we cannot directly apply Fermat's Little Theorem. However, we can use the theorem to help us simplify the problem.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factors of 18: 18 = 2 * 3^2. Now, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem to each of these prime factors.\n\nFor the prime factor 2:\n7^2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\nFor the prime factor 3:\n7^3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 18. We can rewrite 7^27 as (7^2)^13 * 7. Since 7^2 ≡ 1 (mod 2), we know that (7^2)^13 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Therefore, 7^27 ≡ 7 (mod 2).\n\nSimilarly, we can rewrite 7^27 as (7^3)^9. Since 7^3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we know that (7^3)^9 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Therefore, 7^27 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\nNow, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 18. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if we have a system of linear congruences:\n\nx ≡ a1 (mod m1)\nx ≡ a2 (mod m2)\n...\nx ≡ an (mod mn)\n\nwhere m1, m2, ..., mn are pairwise relatively prime, then there exists a unique solution x modulo M, where M = m1 * m2 * ... * mn.\n\nIn our case, we have the following system of linear congruences:\n\nx ≡ 7 (mod 2)\nx ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nSince 2 and 3 are relatively prime, we can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We have M = 2 * 3 = 6. We can now find the unique solution x modulo 6.\n\nThe solution to this system of linear congruences is x ≡ 1 (mod 6). Therefore, the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 18 is the same as the remainder when 1 is divided by 18, which is 1."
