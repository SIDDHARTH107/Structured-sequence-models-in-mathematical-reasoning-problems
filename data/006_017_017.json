    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time (a month) with a known average rate (5 accidents per month).\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (accidents), k is the desired number of events (3 accidents), λ is the average rate of events (5 accidents per month), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (5^3 * e^(-5)) / 3!\n\nP(X = 3) = (125 * e^(-5)) / 6\n\nP(X = 3) = (125 * 0.0067379) / 6\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.14037\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 accidents involving pedestrians occur on the particular road in a given month is approximately 14.04%."
