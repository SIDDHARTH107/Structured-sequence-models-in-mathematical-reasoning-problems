    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the union of the symmetric difference of A and B with the set {2, 4, 6}. Finally, prove that the result you obtained is distributive over the union of A and B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it's the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the symmetric difference of A and B with the set {2, 4, 6}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ {2, 4, 6} = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∪ {2, 4, 6} = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the result obtained is distributive over the union of A and B. Distributive property states that:\n\nA ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)\n\nLet's use the result we obtained, {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}, as set C.\n\nA ∪ (B ∩ C) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ ({3, 4, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 2, 4, 5, 6})\nB ∩ C = {4, 5, 6}\nA ∪ (B ∩ C) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C):\n\n(A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSince A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C), the distributive property holds, and the result we obtained, {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}, is distributive over the union of A and B."
