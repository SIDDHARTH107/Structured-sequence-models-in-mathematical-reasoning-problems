    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1}\nB - A = {5}\n\nA ∆ B = {1} ∪ {5} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection. Commutativity with respect to intersection means that for any two sets A and B, (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = (A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B). \n\nLet's find (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = {1, 5} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nNow, let's find (A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B):\n\n(A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B) = {2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 5} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = (A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B), the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection. However, the original statement asked to show that it is not commutative. In this case, the statement is incorrect, as the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection."
