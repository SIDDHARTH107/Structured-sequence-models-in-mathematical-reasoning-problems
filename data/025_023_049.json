    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^p(X) for p = 0, 1, 2, 3, we first need to understand the singularities of X. The variety X is given by the zero locus of the homogeneous polynomial f(x, y, z) = x^4 + y^4 + z^4 in the complex projective space P^2. The singularities of X can be found by computing the partial derivatives of f with respect to x, y, and z and finding their common zeros:\n\n∂f/∂x = 4x^3\n∂f/∂y = 4y^3\n∂f/∂z = 4z^3\n\nSetting these equal to zero, we get:\n\n4x^3 = 0 => x = 0\n4y^3 = 0 => y = 0\n4z^3 = 0 => z = 0\n\nHowever, since X is a projective variety, the point (0, 0, 0) does not exist in P^2. Therefore, X is a smooth variety with no singularities.\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^p(X) using the ordinary cohomology groups H^p(X) since X is smooth. For a smooth projective variety of dimension n, the cohomology groups are given by:\n\nH^p(X) = 0 for p > 2n\nH^p(X) = C for p = 0\nH^p(X) = C^(2n - p) for p odd\n\nIn our case, X is a smooth projective curve (dimension 1) in P^2, so we have:\n\nIH^0(X) = H^0(X) = C\nIH^1(X) = H^1(X) = C^2\nIH^2(X) = H^2(X) = C\nIH^3(X) = H^3(X) = 0\n\nSo, the intersection cohomology groups of X are:\n\nIH^0(X) = C\nIH^1(X) = C^2\nIH^2(X) = C\nIH^3(X) = 0"
