    "message_1": "A principal hires an agent to sell his product. The agent's effort in selling the product determines the probability of success, giving the principal a profit of $100 if successful, and a loss of $50 if not successful. The agent has two levels of effort he can exert, a high effort that costs him $40, and gives a 70% chance of success, and a low effort that costs him $20, and gives a 40% chance of success. If the agent is risk-neutral and only cares about maximizing his profit, what effort level will he choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which effort level the agent will choose, we need to calculate the expected profit for each effort level.\n\nFor the high effort level:\nExpected profit = (Probability of success * Profit if successful) - (Probability of failure * Loss if not successful) - Cost of effort\nExpected profit = (0.7 * $100) - (0.3 * $50) - $40\nExpected profit = $70 - $15 - $40\nExpected profit = $15\n\nFor the low effort level:\nExpected profit = (Probability of success * Profit if successful) - (Probability of failure * Loss if not successful) - Cost of effort\nExpected profit = (0.4 * $100) - (0.6 * $50) - $20\nExpected profit = $40 - $30 - $20\nExpected profit = -$10\n\nSince the agent wants to maximize his profit, he will choose the high effort level, as it results in an expected profit of $15, compared to a -$10 expected profit for the low effort level."
