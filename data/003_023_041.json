    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nC = |A| * |B| * sin(θ) * n\n\nwhere C is the cross product, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3^2 + (-2)^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 4 + 16) = √29\n|B| = √(5^2 + 1^2 + (-2)^2) = √(25 + 1 + 4) = √30\n\nNext, let's find the angle θ between vectors A and B using the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\n3*5 + (-2)*1 + 4*(-2) = 15 - 2 - 8 = 5\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| * |B|)\ncos(θ) = 5 / (√29 * √30)\nθ = arccos(5 / (√29 * √30))\n\nNow, let's find the sin(θ):\n\nsin(θ) = √(1 - cos^2(θ))\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (5 / (√29 * √30))^2)\n\nFinally, let's find the unit vector n perpendicular to both A and B using the cross product formula:\n\nn = (A x B) / |A x B|\n\nA x B = [(A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y), (A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z), (A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x)]\nA x B = [(-2 * -2) - (4 * 1), (4 * 5) - (3 * -2), (3 * 1) - (-2 * 5)]\nA x B = [4 + 4, 20 + 6, 3 + 10]\nA x B = [8, 26, 13]\n\n|A x B| = √(8^2 + 26^2 + 13^2) = √(64 + 676 + 169) = √909\n\nn = [8/√909, 26/√909, 13/√909]\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product C:\n\nC = |A| * |B| * sin(θ) * n\nC = √29 * √30 * √(1 - (5 / (√29 * √30))^2) * [8/√909, 26/√909, 13/√909]\n\nThe cross product of vector A and vector B using trigonometry is:\n\nC = √29 * √30 * √(1 - (5 / (√29 * √30))^2) * [8/√909, 26/√909, 13/√909]\n\nNote: The result is left in this form because the expression for sin(θ) is quite complex, and the numerical values would be approximations."
