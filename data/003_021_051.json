    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors A and B, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of A and B, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product A · B:\n\nA · B = (3 * -2) + (4 * 5) = -6 + 20 = 14\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √((-2)^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n14 = 5 * √29 * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 * √29:\n\ncos(θ) = 14 / (5 * √29)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(14 / (5 * √29))\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, multiply by 180/π:\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 * (180/π) ≈ 52.7 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors A and B is approximately 52.7 degrees."
