    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base that measures 12 meters by 8 meters and a height of 6 meters. Calculate the volume of the rectangular pyramid in cubic meters.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be calculated by multiplying its length and width:\n\nBase area = length * width\nBase area = 12 meters * 8 meters\nBase area = 96 square meters\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the rectangular pyramid:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\nVolume = (1/3) * 96 square meters * 6 meters\nVolume = (1/3) * 576 cubic meters\nVolume = 192 cubic meters\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 192 cubic meters."
