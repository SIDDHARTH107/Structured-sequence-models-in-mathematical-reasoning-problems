    "message_2": "Since M is a complex manifold of complex dimension 2, it has real dimension 4. Chern classes are characteristic classes of complex vector bundles, and they are defined for each complex dimension. Therefore, for a complex manifold of dimension 2, there are only two non-trivial Chern classes: c_1(M) and c_2(M).\n\nThe remaining Chern classes c_3(M), c_4(M), ... are all trivial (i.e., equal to zero) because they correspond to dimensions higher than the dimension of the manifold M. In other words, there are no more complex dimensions to consider for this manifold.\n\nSo, the values of the remaining Chern classes are:\n\nc_3(M) = 0\nc_4(M) = 0\n...\nc_n(M) = 0 for all n > 2"
