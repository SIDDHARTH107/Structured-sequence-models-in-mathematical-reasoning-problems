    "message_1": "A company needs to fulfill an order of 120 units of products that come in three different sizes: small, medium, and large. Each unit of small product costs $5 to make, while medium units cost $8, and large units cost $12. The company needs to minimize the cost of fulfilling the order without satisfying the order of one particular size completely unacceptable. How many units of each size should the company manufacture to minimize the cost of fulfilling the order?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of small, medium, and large units as S, M, and L, respectively. We know that:\n\nS + M + L = 120\n\nThe company wants to minimize the cost, which can be represented as:\n\nCost = 5S + 8M + 12L\n\nSince the company doesn't want to make any size completely unacceptable, we need to have at least one unit of each size. So, we can start with S = 1, M = 1, and L = 1. This leaves us with 117 units to distribute among the sizes.\n\nNow, to minimize the cost, we should try to allocate as many units as possible to the small size, as it is the cheapest. Let's increase the number of small units:\n\nS = 1 + 117 = 118\nM = 1\nL = 1\n\nHowever, this distribution makes the medium and large sizes almost unacceptable. To balance the distribution and keep the cost low, we can try to allocate some units to the medium size:\n\nS = 58\nM = 58\nL = 4\n\nThis distribution provides a more balanced allocation of units among the sizes while keeping the cost low. The total cost for this distribution would be:\n\nCost = 5(58) + 8(58) + 12(4) = 290 + 464 + 48 = $802\n\nSo, the company should manufacture 58 small units, 58 medium units, and 4 large units to minimize the cost of fulfilling the order while keeping the distribution of sizes acceptable."
