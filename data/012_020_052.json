    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nIn the given graph G, we can see that there are 6 vertices, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. We will now determine the automorphisms of the graph.\n\n1. The identity automorphism: This is the trivial automorphism that maps each vertex to itself. It is always an element of the automorphism group.\n\n2. Rotation by 120 degrees clockwise: This automorphism maps A to C, C to E, E to A, B to D, D to F, and F to B. We can denote this automorphism as (ACE)(BDF).\n\n3. Rotation by 120 degrees counterclockwise: This automorphism maps A to E, E to C, C to A, B to F, F to D, and D to B. We can denote this automorphism as (AEC)(BFD).\n\n4. Reflection about the vertical axis: This automorphism maps A to A, B to F, F to B, C to C, D to E, and E to D. We can denote this automorphism as (BF)(DE).\n\n5. Reflection about the line passing through A and the midpoint of edge CD: This automorphism maps A to A, B to D, D to B, C to E, E to C, and F to F. We can denote this automorphism as (BD)(CE).\n\n6. Reflection about the line passing through A and the midpoint of edge EF: This automorphism maps A to A, B to C, C to B, D to F, F to D, and E to E. We can denote this automorphism as (BC)(DF).\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of the given graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of graph G is:\n\n{(), (ACE)(BDF), (AEC)(BFD), (BF)(DE), (BD)(CE), (BC)(DF)}"
