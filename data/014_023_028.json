    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Rail Fence Cipher with a depth of 4, we arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows. The pattern looks like this:\n\nM---A---S\n-T--E-A-I\n--H-M-T-C\n---M---I\n\nNow, we read the letters row by row to get the ciphertext. The resulting ciphertext is: \"MAS TEAI HMT CM MI\". If we remove the spaces, the final ciphertext is \"MASTEAIHMTCMI\"."
