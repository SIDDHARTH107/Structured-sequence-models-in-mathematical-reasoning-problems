    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 6358 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\nSo, let's find the sum of the digits of 6358:\n\n6 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 22\n\nNow, we can see that 22 is not divisible by 9. To find the remainder, we can divide 22 by 9:\n\n22 รท 9 = 2 (remainder 4)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 6358 is divided by 9 is 4."
