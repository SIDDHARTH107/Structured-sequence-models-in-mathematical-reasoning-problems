    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of X(w) = 2jw/(w^2 + 4), we need to compute the following integral:\n\nx(t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[X(w) * e^(jwt)] dw, where the integral is taken over all w from -∞ to +∞.\n\nSo, x(t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[(2jw/(w^2 + 4)) * e^(jwt)] dw.\n\nWe can recognize that the given function X(w) is the Fourier transform of a damped sinusoid. To find the inverse Fourier transform, we can use the following property of the Fourier transform:\n\nIf X(w) = A * (jw / (w^2 + a^2)), then x(t) = A * e^(-a|t|) * sin(at), where A and a are constants.\n\nIn our case, A = 2 and a = 2. So, x(t) = 2 * e^(-2|t|) * sin(2t).\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x(t) at t = 2:\n\nx(2) = 2 * e^(-2 * |2|) * sin(2 * 2)\nx(2) = 2 * e^(-4) * sin(4)\nx(2) ≈ 2 * 0.0183 * 0.7568\nx(2) ≈ 0.0276\n\nTherefore, the value of x(t) at t = 2 is approximately 0.0276."
