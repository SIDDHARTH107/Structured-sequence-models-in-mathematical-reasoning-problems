The cost of traveling between each city is given in the following table:\n\n| City | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 0 | 5 | 2 | 7 | 3 |\n| 2 | 5 | 0 | 3 | 4 | 1 |\n| 3 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 4 | 6 |\n| 4 | 7 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 2 |\n| 5 | 3 | 1 | 6 | 2 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the shortest possible route that the salesman can take to visit all of the cities and return to his starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible permutations of the cities and calculating the total cost for each permutation. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) permutations, which is equal to 120. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5, resulting in 24 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the 24 unique routes and their total costs:\n\n1-2-3-4-5-1: 5+3+4+2+3 = 17\n1-2-3-5-4-1: 5+3+6+2+7 = 23\n1-2-4-3-5-1: 5+4+4+6+3 = 22\n1-2-4-5-3-1: 5+4+2+6+2 = 19\n1-2-5-3-4-1: 5+1+6+4+7 = 23\n1-2-5-4-3-1: 5+1+2+4+2 = 14\n\n1-3-2-4-5-1: 2+3+4+2+3 = 14\n1-3-2-5-4-1: 2+3+1+2+7 = 15\n1-3-4-2-5-1: 2+4+4+1+6 = 17\n1-3-4-5-2-1: 2+4+2+1+5 = 14\n1-3-5-2-4-1: 2+6+1+4+7 = 20\n1-3-5-4-2-1: 2+6+2+4+5 = 19\n\n1-4-2-3-5-1: 7+4+3+6+3 = 23\n1-4-2-5-3-1: 7+4+1+6+2 = 20\n1-4-3-2-5-1: 7+4+3+1+6 = 21\n1-4-3-5-2-1: 7+4+6+1+5 = 23\n1-4-5-2-3-1: 7+2+1+3+2 = 15\n1-4-5-3-2-1: 7+2+6+3+5 = 23\n\n1-5-2-3-4-1: 3+1+3+4+7 = 18\n1-5-2-4-3-1: 3+1+4+4+2 = 14\n1-5-3-2-4-1: 3+6+3+4+7 = 23\n1-5-3-4-2-1: 3+6+4+4+5 = 22\n1-5-4-2-3-1: 3+2+4+3+2 = 14\n1-5-4-3-2-1: 3+2+4+3+5 = 17\n\nThe shortest possible route is either 1-2-5-4-3-1, 1-3-2-4-5-1, 1-3-4-5-2-1, 1-5-2-4-3-1, or 1-5-4-2-3-1, with a total cost of 14."
