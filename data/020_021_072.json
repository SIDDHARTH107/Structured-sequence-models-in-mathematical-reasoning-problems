    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, A and B. The production of A requires 5 hours of machine time, while B requires 8 hours of machine time. The factory has 100 hours of machine time available for production. Each unit of A and B generate a profit of $10 and $15, respectively. Determine the optimal production quantities of A and B to maximize the total profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe total machine time constraint can be represented as:\n5x + 8y â‰¤ 100\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities of A and B, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we need to find the boundary points of the constraint:\n1. When x = 0:\n5(0) + 8y = 100\ny = 12.5\n\n2. When y = 0:\n5x + 8(0) = 100\nx = 20\n\nSo, the boundary points are (0, 12.5) and (20, 0).\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region. Since the constraint is less than or equal to 100, the feasible region will be below the line connecting the boundary points. The feasible region will be a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 12.5), and (20, 0).\n\nNext, we need to find the integer points within the feasible region, as the production quantities must be whole numbers. The integer points within the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 12), (4, 10), (8, 8), (12, 6), (16, 4), and (20, 0).\n\nNow, we will calculate the total profit for each of these integer points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 12) = 10(0) + 15(12) = $180\n3. P(4, 10) = 10(4) + 15(10) = $190\n4. P(8, 8) = 10(8) + 15(8) = $200\n5. P(12, 6) = 10(12) + 15(6) = $210\n6. P(16, 4) = 10(16) + 15(4) = $220\n7. P(20, 0) = 10(20) + 15(0) = $200\n\nThe maximum total profit is $220, which occurs when producing 16 units of product A and 4 units of product B. Therefore, the optimal production quantities are 16 units of A and 4 units of B."
