    "message_1": "Suppose that there are 10 farmers who share a common grazing land, which can support a maximum of 100 cows. Each farmer can bring any number of cows to the land for grazing. The benefits of bringing a cow to the land are shared equally between all the farmers, while the cost of keeping a cow (in terms of lost productivity) falls only on the individual farmer. If each farmer maximizes their own benefit, how many cows will be brought to the land for grazing?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the benefit of bringing a cow to the land as B and the cost of keeping a cow as C. Since the benefits are shared equally among the 10 farmers, each farmer receives B/10 for each cow brought to the land. The net benefit for each farmer for each cow they bring is (B/10 - C).\n\nEach farmer will continue to bring cows to the land as long as the net benefit is positive, i.e., (B/10 - C) > 0. Rearranging the inequality, we get B > 10C.\n\nNow, let's assume that each farmer brings 'x' cows to the land. The total number of cows on the land would be 10x. Since the land can support a maximum of 100 cows, we have 10x ≤ 100.\n\nTo maximize their own benefit, each farmer will bring as many cows as possible while keeping the net benefit positive. So, we need to find the maximum value of 'x' that satisfies both conditions: B > 10C and 10x ≤ 100.\n\nSince we don't have specific values for B and C, we cannot determine the exact number of cows each farmer will bring. However, we can say that the total number of cows brought to the land will be less than or equal to 100, and each farmer will bring a number of cows such that their net benefit remains positive."
