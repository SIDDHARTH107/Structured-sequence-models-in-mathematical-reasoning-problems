    "message_1": "Consider a mechanism design problem where an auction is being held to sell a painting. There are 3 bidders, each with a private value for the painting. The private values are $100, $150, and $200. The auctioneer can choose between two auction formats: a sealed bid first-price auction or a second-price auction. In the sealed bid first-price auction, bidders simultaneously submit a bid, and the highest bidder wins the painting paying their bid. In the second-price auction, bidders simultaneously submit a bid, and the highest bidder wins the painting paying the second highest bid. Which auction format should the auctioneer use to maximize their revenue, and what would be the expected revenue in this case?",
    "message_2": "To determine which auction format the auctioneer should use to maximize their revenue, we need to analyze the expected revenue for both formats.\n\n1. Sealed bid first-price auction:\n\nIn a sealed bid first-price auction, bidders tend to bid below their true valuation to avoid overpaying. Let's assume that each bidder bids a fraction of their true valuation. For simplicity, we can assume that each bidder bids half of the difference between their valuation and the next lowest valuation. \n\nBidder 1 (valuation $100) would bid $100.\nBidder 2 (valuation $150) would bid $(150 - 100)/2 + 100 = $125.\nBidder 3 (valuation $200) would bid $(200 - 150)/2 + 150 = $175.\n\nIn this case, Bidder 3 would win the auction and pay $175.\n\n2. Second-price auction:\n\nIn a second-price auction, bidders have the incentive to bid their true valuation, as they will only pay the second highest bid if they win. \n\nBidder 1 would bid $100.\nBidder 2 would bid $150.\nBidder 3 would bid $200.\n\nIn this case, Bidder 3 would win the auction and pay $150 (the second highest bid).\n\nComparing the two auction formats, the sealed bid first-price auction would generate more revenue for the auctioneer ($175) than the second-price auction ($150). Therefore, the auctioneer should choose the sealed bid first-price auction to maximize their revenue, and the expected revenue in this case would be $175."
