    "message_2": "To compute the ElGamal ciphertext C, we first need to compute the public key. The public key is given by (p, alpha, beta), where beta = alpha^d mod p.\n\nGiven p = 17, alpha = 3, and d = 7, we can compute beta as follows:\n\nbeta = alpha^d mod p\nbeta = 3^7 mod 17\nbeta = 2187 mod 17\nbeta = 10\n\nNow, the public key is (17, 3, 10).\n\nTo encrypt the message M = 11, we need to choose a random integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ p-2). Let's choose k = 5 for this example. Now, we compute the ciphertext C as a pair of integers (c1, c2) using the following formulas:\n\nc1 = alpha^k mod p\nc2 = M * (beta^k) mod p\n\nUsing the chosen k = 5, we can compute c1 and c2 as follows:\n\nc1 = alpha^k mod p\nc1 = 3^5 mod 17\nc1 = 243 mod 17\nc1 = 4\n\nc2 = M * (beta^k) mod p\nc2 = 11 * (10^5) mod 17\nc2 = 11 * 100000 mod 17\nc2 = 1100000 mod 17\nc2 = 15\n\nSo, the ciphertext C is the pair of integers (c1, c2) = (4, 15)."
