    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 7 using the tabu search algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the search:\n- Set the current solution x_current to a random value in the range [0, 5].\n- Set the best solution x_best to x_current.\n- Set the tabu list to an empty list of length 5.\n- Set the iteration counter to 0.\n\n2. Perform the search:\n- While the iteration counter is less than 50:\n  - Generate a set of candidate solutions in the neighborhood of x_current. For example, you can generate 10 random solutions in the range [x_current - 0.5, x_current + 0.5], making sure they are within the range [0, 5].\n  - Remove any candidate solutions that are in the tabu list.\n  - Evaluate the objective function f(x) for each candidate solution and select the best candidate x_candidate with the lowest f(x) value.\n  - If f(x_candidate) is less than f(x_best), update x_best to x_candidate.\n  - Add x_current to the tabu list. If the tabu list is full, remove the oldest element.\n  - Set x_current to x_candidate.\n  - Increment the iteration counter.\n\n3. Return the best solution x_best and its corresponding f(x) value.\n\nNote that the tabu search algorithm is a metaheuristic, which means it may not always find the exact minimum value, but it can provide a good approximation. The quality of the solution depends on the parameters used, such as the size of the neighborhood, the length of the tabu list, and the number of iterations."
