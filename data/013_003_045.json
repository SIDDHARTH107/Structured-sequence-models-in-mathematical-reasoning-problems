    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, there are two players, A and B. Player A has $100 and proposes a split to player B. If player B accepts, they split the money as proposed. If player B rejects, neither player gets any money. \n\nIf player A proposes a split of $75 to themselves and $25 to player B, what is the minimum amount that player B should accept for the split to be considered fair according to the Nash equilibrium concept in Game Theory?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when player A offers the smallest possible amount to player B, and player B accepts it. This is because player B would prefer to receive any amount greater than zero rather than rejecting the offer and getting nothing. \n\nIn this case, the minimum amount that player B should accept for the split to be considered fair according to the Nash equilibrium concept in Game Theory is $1. This is because if player A offers any amount greater than $0 to player B, player B should accept it, as it is better than receiving nothing. However, it's important to note that in real-world situations, people often reject offers that they perceive as unfair, even if it means getting nothing."
