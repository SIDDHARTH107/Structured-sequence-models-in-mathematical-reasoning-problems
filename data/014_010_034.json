    "message_1": "Suppose we are using a simple substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet is replaced with a corresponding letter. If the letter 'E' is replaced with the letter 'X', what letter would the letter 'S' be replaced with?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the pattern of the substitution cipher. Since 'E' is replaced with 'X', we can find the difference between their positions in the alphabet.\n\n'E' is the 5th letter, and 'X' is the 24th letter. The difference between their positions is 24 - 5 = 19.\n\nNow, we can apply this pattern to the letter 'S'. 'S' is the 19th letter in the alphabet. Adding the difference of 19, we get 19 + 19 = 38. Since there are only 26 letters in the alphabet, we need to wrap around by subtracting 26 from 38: 38 - 26 = 12.\n\nThe 12th letter in the alphabet is 'L'. Therefore, in this simple substitution cipher, the letter 'S' would be replaced with the letter 'L'."
