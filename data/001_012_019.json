    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common factors from the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 18x^2y - 24xy^2 + 30x^2\nWe can factor out 6x from each term:\n6x(3x^1y^1 - 4x^0y^2 + 5x^1y^0)\n\nDenominator: 6xy\n\nNow, we can simplify the rational expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their common factor, which is 6x:\n\n(6x(3x^1y^1 - 4x^0y^2 + 5x^1y^0)) / (6xy)\n\nDivide by 6x:\n\n(3x^1y^1 - 4x^0y^2 + 5x^1y^0) / y\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression with simplified exponents:\n\n(3xy - 4y^2 + 5x) / y\n\nThis is the simplified rational expression."
