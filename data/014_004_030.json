    "message_1": "Suppose you are tasked with conducting an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) computation using the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over a finite field with modulus p = 17. Given a private key d = 5 and a public key Q = (13, 4), compute the result of the scalar multiplication of the private key d by the point Q using the point doubling and point addition algorithm in ECC.",
    "message_2": "To compute the scalar multiplication dQ, we will use the double-and-add algorithm. We will represent the binary form of d, which is 5, as 101. Starting from the left-most bit, we will perform point doubling and point addition as necessary.\n\n1. Initialize the result R = O (the point at infinity)\n2. For each bit of d (from left to right):\n   a. Double the point R\n   b. If the bit is 1, add the point Q to R\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. R = O\n2. First bit of d is 1:\n   a. R = 2R = O (since R is the point at infinity)\n   b. R = R + Q = O + (13, 4) = (13, 4)\n\nNow, R = (13, 4)\n\n3. Second bit of d is 0:\n   a. R = 2R = 2(13, 4)\n\nTo compute 2(13, 4), we'll use the point doubling formula:\n\nx3 = (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) - 2x1 (mod p)\ny3 = (x1 - x3) * (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) - y1 (mod p)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (13, 4), a = 2, and p = 17.\n\nx3 = (3 * 13^2 + 2) * (2 * 4)^(-1) - 2 * 13 (mod 17)\nx3 = (3 * 169 + 2) * 8^(-1) - 26 (mod 17)\nx3 = (507 + 2) * 15 - 26 (mod 17)\nx3 = 509 * 15 - 26 (mod 17)\nx3 = 7639 - 26 (mod 17)\nx3 = 7613 (mod 17)\nx3 = 3\n\ny3 = (13 - 3) * (3 * 13^2 + 2) * (2 * 4)^(-1) - 4 (mod 17)\ny3 = 10 * (507 + 2) * 15 - 4 (mod 17)\ny3 = 10 * 509 * 15 - 4 (mod 17)\ny3 = 50950 - 4 (mod 17)\ny3 = 50946 (mod 17)\ny3 = 6\n\nSo, 2(13, 4) = (3, 6). Now, R = (3, 6).\n\n4. Third bit of d is 1:\n   a. R = 2R = 2(3, 6)\n\nTo compute 2(3, 6), we'll use the point doubling formula again:\n\nx3 = (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) - 2x1 (mod p)\ny3 = (x1 - x3) * (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) - y1 (mod p)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (3, 6), a = 2, and p = 17.\n\nx3 = (3 * 3^2 + 2) * (2 * 6)^(-1) - 2 * 3 (mod 17)\nx3 = (3 * 9 + 2) * 12^(-1) - 6 (mod 17)\nx3 = (27 + 2) * 7 - 6 (mod 17)\nx3 = 29 * 7 - 6 (mod 17)\nx3 = 203 - 6 (mod 17)\nx3 = 197 (mod 17)\nx3 = 1\n\ny3 = (3 - 1) * (3 * 3^2 + 2) * (2 * 6)^(-1) - 6 (mod 17)\ny3 = 2 * (27 + 2) * 7 - 6 (mod 17)\ny3 = 2 * 29 * 7 - 6 (mod 17)\ny3 = 58 * 7 - 6 (mod 17)\ny3 = 406 - 6 (mod 17)\ny3 = 400 (mod 17)\ny3 = 2\n\nSo, 2(3, 6) = (1, 2). Now, R = (1, 2).\n\n   b. R = R + Q = (1, 2) + (13, 4)\n\nTo compute (1, 2) + (13, 4), we'll use the point addition formula:\n\nx3 = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) - x1 - x2 (mod p)\ny3 = (x1 - x3) * (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) - y1 (mod p)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (1, 2), (x2, y2) = (13, 4), and p = 17.\n\nx3 = (4 - 2) * (13 - 1)^(-1) - 1 - 13 (mod 17)\nx3 = 2 * 12^(-1) - 14 (mod 17)\nx3 = 2 * 5 - 14 (mod 17)\nx3 = 10 - 14 (mod 17)\nx3 = -4 (mod 17)\nx3 = 13\n\ny3 = (1 - 13) * (4 - 2) * 12^(-1) - 2 (mod 17)\ny3 = -12 * 2 * 5 - 2 (mod 17)\ny3 = -24 * 5 - 2 (mod 17)\ny3 = -120 - 2 (mod 17)\ny3 = -122 (mod 17)\ny3 = 4\n\nSo, (1, 2) + (13, 4) = (13, 4). Now, R = (13, 4).\n\nThe result of the scalar multiplication 5Q is (13, 4)."
