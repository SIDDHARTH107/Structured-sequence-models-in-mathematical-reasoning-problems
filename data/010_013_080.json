    "message_1": "Let $E \\to \\mathbb{S}^2$ be a vector bundle over the two-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$ such that the fiber over each point is a two-dimensional real vector space. If $c_1(E) = 4$, what is the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\mathbb{S}^2)$ of the two-sphere?",
    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a space is a topological invariant, and for a closed surface like the two-sphere, it can be computed using the formula:\n\n$\\chi(\\mathbb{S}^2) = 2 - 2g$\n\nwhere $g$ is the genus of the surface. Since the two-sphere is simply connected and has no holes, its genus is 0. Therefore, the Euler characteristic of the two-sphere is:\n\n$\\chi(\\mathbb{S}^2) = 2 - 2(0) = 2$.\n\nNote that the given information about the vector bundle $E$ and its first Chern class $c_1(E)$ is not needed to compute the Euler characteristic of the two-sphere, as it is a topological invariant of the underlying space itself."
