    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with the given key matrix, we first need to convert the letters to their numerical equivalents (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). \n\nMATH = [12, 0, 19, 7]\n\nNow, we need to break the message into blocks of size 2 (since the key matrix is 2x2) and multiply each block by the key matrix.\n\nBlock 1: [12, 0]\nBlock 2: [19, 7]\n\nNext, we multiply each block by the key matrix:\n\nBlock 1:\n[3 2] * [12] = [3*12 + 2*0] = [36]\n[5 7]   [ 0]   [5*12 + 7*0]   [60]\n\nBlock 2:\n[3 2] * [19] = [3*19 + 2*7] = [65]\n[5 7]   [ 7]   [5*19 + 7*7]   [126]\n\nNow, we need to take the results modulo 26 to get the numerical equivalents of the ciphertext:\n\nBlock 1: [36 % 26, 60 % 26] = [10, 8]\nBlock 2: [65 % 26, 126 % 26] = [13, 0]\n\nFinally, we convert the numerical equivalents back to letters:\n\n[10, 8, 13, 0] = KIM_A\n\nSo, the ciphertext that results from encrypting the message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher algorithm with the given key matrix is \"KIM_A\"."
