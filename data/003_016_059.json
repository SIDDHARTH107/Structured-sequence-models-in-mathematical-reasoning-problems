    "message_2": "A sinusoidal function in the form y = A * sin(B * (x - C)) has a phase shift of C units to the right. In the given function y = 2sin(3x - pi/4), we can rewrite it as y = 2sin(3 * (x - pi/12)) by dividing the phase term by the coefficient of x (which is 3 in this case).\n\nSo, the phase shift is pi/12 units to the right."
