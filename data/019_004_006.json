Since $p$ is true for every moment in time, we know that $p$ is true at time $t$. Now, we are given that $q$ is true at some future moment in time. Let $t'$ be the earliest such moment in time when $q$ is true, where $t' \\ge t$.\n\nSince $q$ is true at time $t'$, we can say that $q$ will eventually be true at time $t$. Thus, the implication $(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond q)$ holds at time $t$. Since $t$ was an arbitrary moment in time, we can conclude that the implication holds for every moment in time.\n\nTherefore, the given temporal logic statement $\\Box (p \\rightarrow \\Diamond q)$ is true."
