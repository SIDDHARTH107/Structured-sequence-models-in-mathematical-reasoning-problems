    "message_2": "To find the equation of the sine function with the given parameters, we can use the general form of a sine function:\n\ny = A * sin(B(x - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the coefficient that determines the period, C is the horizontal shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, we have A = 3 (amplitude), period = π/2, and D = 2 (vertical shift). To find the value of B, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nSubstituting the given period:\n\nπ/2 = 2π / B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 4\n\nSince there is no mention of a horizontal shift, we can assume C = 0. Now we can write the equation of the sine function:\n\ny = 3 * sin(4x) + 2\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the graph at x = π/4, x = π/2, and x = 3π/4:\n\n1. For x = π/4:\ny = 3 * sin(4(π/4)) + 2\ny = 3 * sin(π) + 2\ny = 3 * 0 + 2\ny = 2\nCoordinate: (π/4, 2)\n\n2. For x = π/2:\ny = 3 * sin(4(π/2)) + 2\ny = 3 * sin(2π) + 2\ny = 3 * 0 + 2\ny = 2\nCoordinate: (π/2, 2)\n\n3. For x = 3π/4:\ny = 3 * sin(4(3π/4)) + 2\ny = 3 * sin(3π) + 2\ny = 3 * 0 + 2\ny = 2\nCoordinate: (3π/4, 2)\n\nSo, the coordinates of the graph at the given x-values are (π/4, 2), (π/2, 2), and (3π/4, 2)."
