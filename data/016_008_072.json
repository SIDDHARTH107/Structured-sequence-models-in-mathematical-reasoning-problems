    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be found using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces in each iteration, and M is the scaling factor (how many times smaller each piece is compared to the original).\n\nFor the Koch curve, there are N = 4 self-similar pieces in each iteration, and each piece is M = 3 times smaller than the original.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with the length of the original line segment or the number of iterations. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve remains approximately 1.2619, regardless of the original line segment having a length of 3 units and the iteration step being repeated 5 times."
