    "message_2": "To find the probability that the region will not be hit by a hurricane in the next 3 years, we first need to find the probability of the region not being hit by a hurricane in a single year. \n\nThe probability of not being hit by a hurricane in a year is 1 - the probability of being hit by a hurricane in a year. In this case, it's 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of this happening for 3 consecutive years. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.614125\n\nSo, the probability that the region will not be hit by a hurricane in the next 3 years is approximately 0.614 or 61.4%."
