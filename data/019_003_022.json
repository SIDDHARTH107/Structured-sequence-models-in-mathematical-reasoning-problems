Here is a precise question for them to solve:\n\nGiven the formula □(p → q) → (□p → □q), prove that if John is honest, then if he speaks the truth, he speaks the truth necessarily. In other words, if John always tells the truth, then anything he says that is true is necessarily true.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into a modal logic formula and then use the given formula to prove the statement.\n\nLet's represent the given statement as follows:\n\np: John is honest\nq: John speaks the truth\n\nThe given statement can be translated as: If John is honest (p), then if he speaks the truth (q), he speaks the truth necessarily (□q).\n\nNow, we are given the formula: □(p → q) → (□p → □q)\n\nWe know that John is honest, so we can assume p is true. We want to prove that if he speaks the truth (q), then he speaks the truth necessarily (□q).\n\nSince John is honest, we can say that he always tells the truth, which means that if p is true, then q is true. In modal logic, this can be represented as:\n\np → q\n\nNow, we know that John is honest, so we can say that he necessarily always tells the truth. In modal logic, this can be represented as:\n\n□(p → q)\n\nNow, we can use the given formula to prove the statement. We have:\n\n□(p → q) → (□p → □q)\n\nWe know that □(p → q) is true, so we can use modus ponens to derive:\n\n□p → □q\n\nSince John is honest (p is true), we can also say that □p is true (John is necessarily honest). Now, we can use modus ponens again to derive:\n\n□q\n\nSo, we have proved that if John speaks the truth (q), then he speaks the truth necessarily (□q). In other words, if John always tells the truth, then anything he says that is true is necessarily true."
