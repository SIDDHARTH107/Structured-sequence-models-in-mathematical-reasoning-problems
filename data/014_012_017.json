    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Vigenere cipher with the key \"MATH\", we first need to repeat the key to match the length of the message. In this case, the key becomes \"MATHM\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square to encrypt each letter of the message. The Vigenere square consists of 26 rows and columns, each representing the letters of the alphabet. To encrypt a letter, we find the intersection of the row corresponding to the message letter and the column corresponding to the key letter.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter:\n\n1. H (message) and M (key): Go to the row of H and the column of M, which gives us the letter Z.\n2. E (message) and A (key): Go to the row of E and the column of A, which gives us the letter E.\n3. L (message) and T (key): Go to the row of L and the column of T, which gives us the letter X.\n4. L (message) and H (key): Go to the row of L and the column of H, which gives us the letter D.\n5. O (message) and M (key): Go to the row of O and the column of M, which gives us the letter W.\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"ZEXDW\"."
