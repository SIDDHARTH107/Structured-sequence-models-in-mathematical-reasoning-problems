    "message_1": "A Latin square of order 4 is a 4 x 4 array filled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, such that each row and each column contains each of the numbers exactly once. How many distinct Latin squares of order 4 are there?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct Latin squares of order 4, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in any order, so there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to fill it. However, since we are only interested in distinct Latin squares, we can fix the first row as (1, 2, 3, 4) without loss of generality. This is because any other arrangement of the first row can be transformed into this fixed arrangement by simply renaming the symbols.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to fill it, as the first element must be different from the first element in the first row (which is fixed as 1), and then there are 2 choices for the second element, and only 1 choice for the remaining two elements.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 cases to consider:\n\n   a) The first element is the same as the second element in the second row. In this case, there are 2 choices for the second element in the third row, and then the remaining two elements are determined. So, there are 2 ways to fill the third row in this case.\n\n   b) The first element is different from the second element in the second row. In this case, there is only 1 choice for the second element in the third row, and then the remaining two elements are determined. So, there is 1 way to fill the third row in this case.\n\n   In total, there are 2 + 1 = 3 ways to fill the third row.\n\n4. Once the first three rows are filled, the fourth row is completely determined, as each element must be different from the corresponding elements in the first three rows.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct Latin squares of order 4 is:\n\n1 (for the fixed first row) × 3! (for the second row) × 3 (for the third row) × 1 (for the determined fourth row) = 1 × 6 × 3 × 1 = 18.\n\nTherefore, there are 18 distinct Latin squares of order 4."
