    "message_1": "Consider a regular hexagon with side length of 10cm. Divide it into 6 equilateral triangles, as shown below:\n\n![Hexagon divided into 6 equilateral triangles](https://i.imgur.com/fhwnN8N.png)\n\nNow, divide each of these equilateral triangles into 4 smaller equilateral triangles by connecting the midpoints of adjacent sides, as shown below:\n\n![Hexagon divided into equilateral triangles and smaller ones](https://i.imgur.com/8Ovqbzj.png)\n\nFind the total number of small equilateral triangles that the hexagon is now divided into.",
    "message_2": "When we divide each of the 6 equilateral triangles into 4 smaller equilateral triangles, we get a total of 6 * 4 = 24 small equilateral triangles.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the overlapping triangles in the center of the hexagon. There are 6 of these overlapping triangles, which form another equilateral triangle.\n\nSo, the total number of small equilateral triangles that the hexagon is now divided into is 24 + 1 (the central equilateral triangle) = 25."
