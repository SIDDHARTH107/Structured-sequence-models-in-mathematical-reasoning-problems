    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the given function f(z) = (1 + z)/(z^2 - 4z + 3) at the point z = 1, we first need to factor the denominator and rewrite the function in a more suitable form for expansion.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^2 - 4z + 3 = (z - 1)(z - 3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = (1 + z)/((z - 1)(z - 3))\n\nNext, we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n(1 + z)/((z - 1)(z - 3)) = A/(z - 1) + B/(z - 3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z - 1)(z - 3) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n1 + z = A(z - 3) + B(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in suitable values for z:\n\n1. z = 1:\n1 + 1 = A(1 - 3) + B(1 - 1)\n2 = -2A\nA = -1\n\n2. z = 3:\n1 + 3 = A(3 - 3) + B(3 - 1)\n4 = 2B\nB = 2\n\nNow we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = -1/(z - 1) + 2/(z - 3)\n\nTo find the Laurent series expansion at z = 1, we need to expand the function in powers of (z - 1). We can rewrite the second term as:\n\n2/(z - 3) = 2/(2 - (1 - z)) = 1/(1 - (1 - z)/2)\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n1/(1 - x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nApplying this to our function:\n\n1/(1 - (1 - z)/2) = 1 + (1 - z)/2 + (1 - z)^2/4 + (1 - z)^3/8 + ...\n\nNow, we can combine this with the first term of f(z):\n\nf(z) = -1/(z - 1) + 1 + (1 - z)/2 + (1 - z)^2/4 + (1 - z)^3/8 + ...\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of the given function f(z) = (1 + z)/(z^2 - 4z + 3) at the point z = 1."
