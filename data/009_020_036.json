    "message_2": "To find the optimal control input 𝑢𝑡 that minimizes the cost functional 𝐽, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function:\n\nH(𝑥, 𝑢, 𝜆) = 𝜆(2𝑥 + 𝑢)\n\nwhere 𝜆 is the costate variable. The necessary conditions for optimality are:\n\n1. 𝑑𝑥/𝑑𝑡 = ∂H/∂𝜆\n2. 𝑑𝜆/𝑑𝑡 = -∂H/∂𝑥\n3. ∂H/∂𝑢 = 0\n\nNow, let's compute the derivatives:\n\n1. 𝑑𝑥/𝑑𝑡 = 2𝑥 + 𝑢 (from the given differential equation)\n2. 𝑑𝜆/𝑑𝑡 = -2𝜆\n3. ∂H/∂𝑢 = 𝜆\n\nFrom equation (3), we have 𝜆 = 0. However, this would imply that 𝑑𝜆/𝑑𝑡 = 0, which contradicts equation (2). Therefore, we must have a \"bang-bang\" control, where 𝑢𝑡 is either -1 or 1.\n\nNow, let's solve the differential equations for 𝑥 and 𝜆:\n\n1. 𝑑𝑥/𝑑𝑡 = 2𝑥 + 𝑢 => 𝑥(𝑡) = (C1 * e^(2t) - 𝑢/2) * e^(-2t)\n2. 𝑑𝜆/𝑑𝑡 = -2𝜆 => 𝜆(𝑡) = C2 * e^(-2t)\n\nApplying the initial condition 𝑥(0) = 1, we get:\n\n1 = C1 - 𝑢/2 => C1 = 1 + 𝑢/2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of 𝑢 that satisfies the final condition 𝑥(1) = 4:\n\n4 = (1 + 𝑢/2) * e^(2(1)) - 𝑢/2 * e^(-2(1))\n\nSolving this equation numerically, we find that 𝑢 ≈ 0.430. However, since 𝑢 must be either -1 or 1, we choose 𝑢 = 1 as it is closer to the numerical solution.\n\nTherefore, the optimal control input 𝑢𝑡 = 1 minimizes the cost functional 𝐽."
