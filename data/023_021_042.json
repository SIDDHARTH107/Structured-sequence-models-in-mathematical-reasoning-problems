    "message_1": "A uniform electric field of intensity 500 V/m is applied to a material having a relative permittivity of 4. Find the displacement current density produced if the electric field varies with time as E = 500cos(10^8t) V/m. Use Fourier transform to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement current density, we first need to find the electric displacement field (D) and then take the time derivative of it. The electric displacement field is related to the electric field (E) and the relative permittivity (ε_r) as follows:\n\nD = ε_0 * ε_r * E\n\nwhere ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 F/m).\n\nGiven the relative permittivity (ε_r) of 4, we can find the electric displacement field:\n\nD = (8.854 x 10^-12 F/m) * 4 * (500cos(10^8t) V/m)\n\nD = 35.416 x 10^-10 * cos(10^8t) C/m^2\n\nNow, we need to find the time derivative of D:\n\ndD/dt = -35.416 x 10^-10 * (10^8) * sin(10^8t) A/m^2\n\nThe displacement current density (J_d) is given by the time derivative of the electric displacement field:\n\nJ_d = dD/dt = -3.5416 * 10^7 * sin(10^8t) A/m^2\n\nNow, we are asked to solve the problem using the Fourier transform. However, since the given electric field is already in the time domain and we have found the displacement current density in the time domain, there is no need to apply the Fourier transform in this case. The displacement current density is:\n\nJ_d(t) = -3.5416 * 10^7 * sin(10^8t) A/m^2"
