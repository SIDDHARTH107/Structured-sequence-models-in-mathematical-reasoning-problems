    "message_2": "To find the number of different functions that can be defined from A to B, we need to consider that each element in A can be mapped to any of the elements in B. Since there are 3 elements in A and 4 elements in B, each element in A has 4 choices for mapping to an element in B.\n\nSo, for the first element in A, there are 4 choices, for the second element in A, there are 4 choices, and for the third element in A, there are 4 choices. To find the total number of functions, we multiply the number of choices for each element in A:\n\n4 choices * 4 choices * 4 choices = 4^3 = 64\n\nTherefore, there are 64 different functions that can be defined from A to B using the product type A × B."
