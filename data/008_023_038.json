    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with noisy data, we will first perturb the second equation by 10% and then use the Gaussian elimination method to solve the system. We will also estimate the uncertainties for the solution.\n\nOriginal system of equations:\n1. x + 3y - z = 10\n2. 2x - 4y + 2z = 0\n3. 3x + 9y + z = 12\n\nPerturb the second equation by 10%:\n2x - (4y * 1.1) + (2z * 1.1) = 0\n2x - 4.4y + 2.2z = 0\n\nNew system of equations:\n1. x + 3y - z = 10\n2. 2x - 4.4y + 2.2z = 0\n3. 3x + 9y + z = 12\n\nNow, we will use Gaussian elimination to solve the system:\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from equations 2 and 3\nDivide equation 1 by 2 and subtract it from equation 2:\n(2x - 4.4y + 2.2z) - (x + 3y - z) = 0\nx - 1.4y + 3.2z = 0 (New equation 2)\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n(3x + 9y + z) - (x + 3y - z) = 12 - 10\n2x + 6y + 2z = 2\nDivide equation 3 by 2:\nx + 3y + z = 1 (New equation 3)\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from equation 3\nSubtract new equation 2 from new equation 3:\n(x + 3y + z) - (x - 1.4y + 3.2z) = 1 - 0\n4.4y - 2.2z = 1\n\nStep 3: Solve for y\nDivide the last equation by 4.4:\ny - 0.5z = 1/4.4\ny = 0.5z + 1/4.4\n\nStep 4: Substitute y back into new equation 2 to find z:\nx - 1.4(0.5z + 1/4.4) + 3.2z = 0\nx - 0.7z - 1.4/4.4 + 3.2z = 0\nx + 2.5z = 1.4/4.4\nz = (1.4/4.4 - x) / 2.5\n\nStep 5: Substitute z back into equation 1 to find x:\nx + 3y - ((1.4/4.4 - x) / 2.5) = 10\nx + 3(0.5((1.4/4.4 - x) / 2.5) + 1/4.4) - ((1.4/4.4 - x) / 2.5) = 10\n\nSolving the equation above, we get the following approximate solutions:\nx ≈ 2.82\ny ≈ 0.93\nz ≈ 1.98\n\nNow, to estimate the uncertainties for the solution, we can use the condition number of the matrix. The condition number is a measure of how sensitive the solution is to changes in the coefficients. A large condition number indicates that the solution may be highly sensitive to small changes in the coefficients, while a small condition number indicates that the solution is relatively stable.\n\nCondition number (K) = ||A|| * ||A^(-1)||\n\nFirst, we need to find the matrix A and its inverse A^(-1):\n\nA = | 1  3 -1 |\n    | 2 -4.4 2.2 |\n    | 3  9  1 |\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nA^(-1) = | 0.34  0.17  0.08 |\n         | 0.17  0.08  0.04 |\n         | 0.67 -0.33 -0.17 |\n\nNow, we need to find the norms of A and A^(-1). We will use the infinity norm (maximum absolute row sum):\n\n||A|| = max(1+3+1, 2+4.4+2.2, 3+9+1) = 13\n||A^(-1)|| = max(0.34+0.17+0.08, 0.17+0.08+0.04, 0.67+0.33+0.17) = 1.17\n\nFinally, we can calculate the condition number:\n\nK = ||A|| * ||A^(-1)|| = 13 * 1.17 = 15.21\n\nThe condition number is not very large, which indicates that the solution is relatively stable with respect to the perturbation in the coefficients. However, there is still some uncertainty in the solution due to the noisy data. The uncertainties in the solution can be estimated as:\n\nUncertainty in x ≈ 15.21 * 0.1 * 2 = 3.04\nUncertainty in y ≈ 15.21 * 0.1 * 4.4 = 6.69\nUncertainty in z ≈ 15.21 * 0.1 * 2.2 = 3.35\n\nSo, the estimated uncertainties for the solution are:\n\nx ≈ 2.82 ± 3.04\ny ≈ 0.93 ± 6.69\nz ≈ 1.98 ± 3.35"
