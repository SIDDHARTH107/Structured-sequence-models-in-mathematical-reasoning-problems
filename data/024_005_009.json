    "message_1": "Consider the surface given by the equation z = x^2 - 2y^2. Determine the values of the principal curvatures at the point (1,-1,1).",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface by the coordinates (u, v) such that x = u, y = v, and z = u^2 - 2v^2. Then, the position vector of the surface is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - 2v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, -4v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [r_u • r_u, r_u • r_v]\n      [r_v • r_u, r_v • r_v]\n\nwhere • denotes the dot product. So,\n\nI = [ (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u), (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, -4v) ]\n      [ (0, 1, -4v) • (1, 0, 2u), (0, 1, -4v) • (0, 1, -4v) ]\n\nI = [ 1 + 4u^2, -8uv ]\n      [ -8uv, 1 + 16v^2 ]\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives of r:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, -8)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [ r_uu • N, r_uv • N ]\n         [ r_uv • N, r_vv • N ]\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector to the surface. To find N, we compute the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, -4v) = (8uv, 8u^2 + 2, -1)\n\nNow, we normalize N:\n\n|N| = √(64u^2v^2 + (8u^2 + 2)^2 + 1)\n\nTo find the unit normal vector, we divide N by |N|:\n\nn = N / |N|\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form:\n\nII = [ (0, 0, 2) • n, (0, 0, 0) • n ]\n         [ (0, 0, 0) • n, (0, 0, -8) • n ]\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 1), we have u = 1 and v = -1:\n\nI = [ 5, 8 ]\n      [ 8, 17 ]\n\nn = (8, 10, -1) / √(65)\n\nII = [ 2/√(65), 0 ]\n         [ 0, 8/√(65) ]\n\nNow, we find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the characteristic equation of the shape operator matrix, which is the product of the inverse of the first fundamental form and the second fundamental form:\n\ndet(II - kI) = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation for k, we get the principal curvatures:\n\nk1 = 1/5\nk2 = 2/5\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, 1) are 1/5 and 2/5."
