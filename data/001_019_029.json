    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x - 4| = 10, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 4 is positive or zero\nIf 3x - 4 â‰¥ 0, then |3x - 4| = 3x - 4. So, the equation becomes:\n\n3x - 4 = 10\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n3x = 14\nx = 14/3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 4 is negative\nIf 3x - 4 < 0, then |3x - 4| = -(3x - 4). So, the equation becomes:\n\n-(3x - 4) = 10\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n-3x + 4 = 10\n-3x = 6\nx = -2\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 14/3 and x = -2."
