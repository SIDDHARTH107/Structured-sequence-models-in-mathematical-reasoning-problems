    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the Calabi-Yau variety at the point (1,1,1), we first need to find the gradient vector of the variety at that point. The gradient vector is given by the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to each variable.\n\nLet $F(x,y,z) = y^2z + 4x^3 - 6xz^2$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 12x^2 - 6z^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = y^2 - 12xz$\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1,1,1):\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(1,1,1) = 12(1)^2 - 6(1)^2 = 6$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(1,1,1) = 2(1)(1) = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}(1,1,1) = (1)^2 - 12(1)(1) = -11$\n\nSo, the gradient vector at the point (1,1,1) is $\\langle 6, 2, -11 \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form:\n\n$(x - 1) = \\frac{6}{2}(y - 1)$\n\n$(x - 1) = \\frac{-11}{2}(z - 1)$\n\nSolving for y and z, we get:\n\n$y = \\frac{1}{3}(x - 1) + 1$\n\n$z = \\frac{-2}{11}(x - 1) + 1$\n\nThese are the parametric equations of the tangent line to the Calabi-Yau variety at the point (1,1,1)."
