    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nx = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6 \\\\\n14 \\\\\n23\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will find the Cholesky decomposition of A, which is a lower triangular matrix L such that A = LL^T.\n\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\nl_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\\nl_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\\\\nl_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nWe can find the elements of L using the following equations:\n\nl_{11} = \\sqrt{a_{11}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n\nl_{21} = a_{21}/l_{11} = 2/1 = 2\n\nl_{31} = a_{31}/l_{11} = 2/1 = 2\n\nl_{22} = \\sqrt{a_{22} - l_{21}^2} = \\sqrt{3 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n\nl_{32} = (a_{32} - l_{31}l_{21})/l_{22} = (5 - 2*2)/1 = 1\n\nl_{33} = \\sqrt{a_{33} - l_{31}^2 - l_{32}^2} = \\sqrt{6 - 2^2 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n\nSo, the Cholesky decomposition of A is:\n\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6 \\\\\n14 \\\\\n23\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny_1 = 6\n\ny_2 = 14 - 2*y_1 = 14 - 2*6 = 2\n\ny_3 = 23 - 2*y_1 - y_2 = 23 - 2*6 - 2 = 9\n\nNow, we will solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nz = 9\n\ny = 2 - z = 2 - 9 = -7\n\nx = 6 - 2*y - 2*z = 6 - 2*(-7) - 2*9 = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1, y = -7, z = 9"
