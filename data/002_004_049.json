    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8cm and the width is 5cm. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(8 + 5)\nPerimeter = 2(13)\nPerimeter = 26cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 26 centimeters."
