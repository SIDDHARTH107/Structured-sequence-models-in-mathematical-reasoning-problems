The second term is the integral of a convergent function, so we can ignore it. Therefore,\n\nF1(k) = -2/(1 + 2πik).\n\nCase 2: x < 0\nF2(k) = ∫[2e^(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over x from -∞ to 0.\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\nF2(k) = [(1/(1 - 2πik)) * 2e^(x) * e^(-2πikx)] from -∞ to 0\n       + ∫[(1/(1 - 2πik))^2 * 2 * e^(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over x from -∞ to 0.\n\nThe first term goes to 0 as x goes to -∞, and at x = 0, it becomes 2/(1 - 2πik). The second term is the integral of a convergent function, so we can ignore it. Therefore,\n\nF2(k) = 2/(1 - 2πik).\n\nNow, we add the Fourier transforms for both cases:\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k) = -2/(1 + 2πik) + 2/(1 - 2πik).\n\nTo combine these fractions, we get:\n\nF(k) = [(-2 + 4πik) + (2 + 4πik)] / ((1 + 2πik)(1 - 2πik))\n     = 8πik / (1 + (2πik)^2)\n     = 8πik / (1 + 4π^2k^2).\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 2e^(-|x|) is:\n\nF(k) = 8πik / (1 + 4π^2k^2)."
