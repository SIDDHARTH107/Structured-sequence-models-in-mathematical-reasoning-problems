    "message_1": "A tower stands 60 meters high. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 45 degrees. What is the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the tower?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have a right triangle with the tower as one side, the ground as the base, and the line of sight to the top of the tower as the hypotenuse. The angle of elevation is given as 45 degrees.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to find the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the tower. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (the height of the tower) to the adjacent side (the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the tower).\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this case, the angle is 45 degrees, and the opposite side is the height of the tower, which is 60 meters.\n\ntan(45) = 60 / adjacent side\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1 (tan(45) = 1):\n\n1 = 60 / adjacent side\n\nTo find the adjacent side (the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the tower), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the adjacent side and then divide by 1:\n\nAdjacent side = 60 / 1\n\nAdjacent side = 60 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the tower is 60 meters."
