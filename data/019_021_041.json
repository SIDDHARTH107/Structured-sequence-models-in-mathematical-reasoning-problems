    "message_1": "In a game of Prisoner's Dilemma, Player A and Player B each have two possible strategies: cooperate (C) or defect (D). If both players cooperate, they each receive a payoff of 3. If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of 1. If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives a payoff of 5 and the cooperator receives a payoff of 0. \n\nSuppose Player A always cooperates and Player B chooses their strategy at random with equal probability. What is the expected payoff for Player A in this scenario?",
    "message_2": "Since Player A always cooperates, we only need to consider the outcomes when Player B cooperates or defects. Player B chooses their strategy at random with equal probability, so the probability of Player B cooperating is 1/2 and the probability of Player B defecting is also 1/2.\n\nWhen both players cooperate (probability = 1/2), Player A receives a payoff of 3.\nWhen Player A cooperates and Player B defects (probability = 1/2), Player A receives a payoff of 0.\n\nTo find the expected payoff for Player A, we multiply the payoffs by their respective probabilities and sum the results:\n\nExpected payoff for Player A = (3 * 1/2) + (0 * 1/2) = 3/2 + 0 = 1.5\n\nSo, the expected payoff for Player A in this scenario is 1.5."
