    "message_1": "A company wants to determine the optimal number of two machines, A or B, to produce their products. Machine A can produce 8 units per hour while machine B can produce 10 units per hour. The company can only afford to purchase a maximum of 4 machines in total. However, at least one machine should be of type B. The company needs to produce at least 80 units of their product in a day. What is the optimal number of machine A and machine B that the company should purchase to minimize their overall cost and meet their daily production requirement?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of machine A and y be the number of machine B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 4 (total machines)\n2. y ≥ 1 (at least one machine B)\n3. 8x + 10y ≥ 80 (daily production requirement)\n\nWe need to find the optimal combination of x and y that satisfies these constraints while minimizing the overall cost.\n\nFirst, let's find the possible combinations of x and y that satisfy the constraints:\n\n1. If y = 1, we have x + 1 ≤ 4, so x ≤ 3. The production requirement is 8x + 10(1) ≥ 80, so 8x ≥ 70, which means x ≥ 8.75. Since x must be an integer, there is no solution for y = 1.\n\n2. If y = 2, we have x + 2 ≤ 4, so x ≤ 2. The production requirement is 8x + 10(2) ≥ 80, so 8x ≥ 60, which means x ≥ 7.5. The only integer value for x that satisfies this constraint is x = 2.\n\n3. If y = 3, we have x + 3 ≤ 4, so x ≤ 1. The production requirement is 8x + 10(3) ≥ 80, so 8x ≥ 50, which means x ≥ 6.25. Since x must be an integer, there is no solution for y = 3.\n\n4. If y = 4, we have x + 4 ≤ 4, so x = 0. The production requirement is 8(0) + 10(4) ≥ 80, which is satisfied.\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions: (x, y) = (2, 2) and (x, y) = (0, 4). To minimize the overall cost, the company should choose the combination with the least number of machines. Therefore, the optimal number of machines is 2 machine A and 2 machine B."
