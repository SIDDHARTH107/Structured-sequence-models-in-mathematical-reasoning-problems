    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, accidents) that occur in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (accidents), k is the number of events we want to find the probability for, λ (lambda) is the average number of events (accidents) per day, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, λ = 0.5 accidents per day. We want to find the probability of at least one accident occurring, which means we need to find the probability of no accidents occurring and subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, we'll find the probability of 0 accidents occurring:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.5) * 0.5^0) / 0! = e^(-0.5)\n\nNow, we'll subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935\n\nSo, the probability of at least one accident occurring on the road is approximately 0.3935 or 39.35%."
