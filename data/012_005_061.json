    "message_1": "Consider a disconnected graph with two connected components, one of which has a diameter of 3 and the other has a diameter of 5. What is the diameter of the entire graph?",
    "message_2": "The diameter of a disconnected graph is considered to be infinite. This is because the diameter is defined as the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph, and in a disconnected graph, there are pairs of vertices for which there is no path connecting them."
