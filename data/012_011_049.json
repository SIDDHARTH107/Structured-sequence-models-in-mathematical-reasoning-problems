    "message_2": "A cut vertex (or articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm and keep track of the discovery time and the low link value for each vertex. The low link value is the smallest discovery time of any vertex reachable from the current vertex, including the vertex itself.\n\nLet's perform DFS on the given graph and calculate the discovery time and low link values for each vertex:\n\n1. Start at vertex A (discovery time: 1)\n   - A -> B (discovery time: 2)\n     - B -> C (discovery time: 3)\n       - C -> D (discovery time: 4)\n         - D -> E (discovery time: 5)\n           - E -> F (discovery time: 6)\n             - F -> G (discovery time: 7)\n               - G -> H (discovery time: 8)\n                 - H -> I (discovery time: 9)\n                   - I -> J (discovery time: 10)\n                   - I -> K (discovery time: 11)\n                 - H -> L (discovery time: 12)\n               - G -> M (discovery time: 13)\n             - F -> N (discovery time: 14)\n           - E -> O (discovery time: 15)\n         - D -> P (discovery time: 16)\n       - C -> Q (discovery time: 17)\n     - B -> R (discovery time: 18)\n\nNow, let's calculate the low link values for each vertex:\n\n- A: min(1, 2) = 1\n- B: min(2, 3, 18) = 2\n- C: min(3, 4, 17) = 3\n- D: min(4, 5, 16) = 4\n- E: min(5, 6, 15) = 5\n- F: min(6, 7, 14) = 6\n- G: min(7, 8, 13) = 7\n- H: min(8, 9, 12) = 8\n- I: min(9, 10, 11) = 9\n- J: min(10) = 10\n- K: min(11) = 11\n- L: min(12) = 12\n- M: min(13) = 13\n- N: min(14) = 14\n- O: min(15) = 15\n- P: min(16) = 16\n- Q: min(17) = 17\n- R: min(18) = 18\n\nNow, we can find the cut vertices and bridges using the low link values:\n\nCut vertices:\n- A vertex is a cut vertex if it's not a root and its low link value is greater than or equal to the discovery time of its parent.\n- Vertex A is a cut vertex since it's the root and has at least two children (B and R).\n\nBridges:\n- An edge is a bridge if the low link value of the child vertex is greater than the discovery time of the parent vertex.\n- The edge (A, B) is a bridge since the low link value of B (2) is greater than the discovery time of A (1).\n\nSo, the cut vertices are {A}, and the bridges are {(A, B)}."
