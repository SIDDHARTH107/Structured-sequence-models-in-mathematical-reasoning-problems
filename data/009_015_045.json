    "message_2": "Let's denote the initial amount of radioactive material as N0 and the remaining amount after 100 days as N100. We know that N100 = 0.25 * N0.\n\nThe decay formula for radioactive material is given by:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(-λt)\n\nwhere N(t) is the amount of radioactive material remaining after time t, λ is the decay constant, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe can plug in the values we know:\n\n0.25 * N0 = N0 * e^(-λ * 100)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by N0:\n\n0.25 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\nTo solve for λ, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.25) = ln(e^(-λ * 100))\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can simplify the right side:\n\nln(0.25) = -λ * 100\n\nNow, we can solve for λ:\n\nλ = -ln(0.25) / 100 ≈ 0.00289\n\nNow that we have the decay constant, we can find the half-life. The half-life (T) is the time it takes for half of the radioactive material to decay. We can use the decay formula again:\n\n0.5 * N0 = N0 * e^(-λ * T)\n\nDivide both sides by N0:\n\n0.5 = e^(-λ * T)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.5) = ln(e^(-λ * T))\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nln(0.5) = -λ * T\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n\nT = -ln(0.5) / λ ≈ 239.51 days\n\nThe half-life of the radioactive material is approximately 239.51 days."
