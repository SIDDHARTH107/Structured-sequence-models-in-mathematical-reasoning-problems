    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the boat's displacement, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since the boat's path forms a right triangle. Let's denote the displacement as d.\n\nd^2 = (10 km)^2 + (15 km)^2\nd^2 = 100 km^2 + 225 km^2\nd^2 = 325 km^2\nd = √325 km\nd ≈ 18.03 km\n\nThe magnitude of the boat's displacement is approximately 18.03 km.\n\nNow, let's find the direction of the boat's displacement using trigonometry. We can use the tangent function to find the angle θ between the north direction and the displacement vector.\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(θ) = 15 km / 10 km\ntan(θ) = 1.5\n\nθ = arctan(1.5)\nθ ≈ 56.31°\n\nThe direction of the boat's displacement is approximately 56.31° east of north.\n\nSo, the boat's displacement is approximately 18.03 km at a direction of 56.31° east of north."
