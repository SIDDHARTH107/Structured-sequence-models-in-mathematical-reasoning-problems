    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (i.e., isomorphisms from the graph to itself) that preserve the structure of the graph.\n\nFor the given graph:\n\n```\n1---2\n|\\ /|\n| X |\n|/ \\|\n3---4\n```\n\nWe can identify the following automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity (no change): {1, 2, 3, 4}\n2. Swap vertices 1 and 2: {2, 1, 3, 4}\n3. Swap vertices 3 and 4: {1, 2, 4, 3}\n4. Swap vertices 1 and 2, and 3 and 4: {2, 1, 4, 3}\n5. Swap vertices 1 and 3: {3, 2, 1, 4}\n6. Swap vertices 1 and 3, and 2 and 4: {3, 4, 1, 2}\n7. Swap vertices 2 and 4: {1, 4, 3, 2}\n8. Swap vertices 2 and 4, and 1 and 3: {3, 4, 1, 2}\n\nThese 8 automorphisms form the automorphism group of the given graph. The group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, which is the group of symmetries of a square."
