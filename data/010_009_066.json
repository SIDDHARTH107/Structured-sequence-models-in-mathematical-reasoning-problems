    "message_2": "To show that there exists a triangulation of the unit square $S$ with at most $10$ triangles, we will provide an explicit construction of such a triangulation.\n\nDivide the unit square into four smaller squares of side length $1/2$. Now, divide each of these smaller squares into two right triangles by drawing a diagonal. This gives us a total of $4 \\times 2 = 8$ triangles.\n\nHowever, we can further improve this triangulation. Consider the central square formed by the intersection of the diagonals of the four smaller squares. This central square has side length $1/2$. Divide this central square into two right triangles by drawing a diagonal. Now, we have a total of $8 - 4 + 2 = 6$ triangles.\n\nFinally, consider the four corner triangles of the unit square. Divide each of these corner triangles into two smaller triangles by drawing a diagonal from the right angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. This adds $4 \\times 1 = 4$ triangles to our triangulation.\n\nThus, we have a triangulation of the unit square $S$ with a total of $6 + 4 = 10$ triangles."
