    "message_2": "To find the electrostatic potential at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the sphere, we can use the formula for the potential due to a point charge, since the sphere is a conductor and the charge is uniformly distributed on its surface.\n\nThe formula for the electrostatic potential V due to a point charge Q at a distance r from the charge is:\n\nV = k * Q / r\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant, which is approximately 8.99 * 10^9 N m^2 C^-2.\n\nGiven the charge Q = 3 µC = 3 * 10^-6 C and the distance r = 8 cm = 0.08 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * (3 * 10^-6 C) / (0.08 m)\n\nV = 26.97 * 10^3 N m^2 C^-2\n\nV ≈ 26.97 kV\n\nSo, the electrostatic potential at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the sphere is approximately 26.97 kV."
