    "message_1": "A coin has been flipped 20 times and landed on heads 14 times. What is the probability of getting tails on the next flip?",
    "message_2": "The probability of getting tails on the next flip is independent of the previous flips. A fair coin has two sides, heads and tails, so the probability of getting tails on the next flip is 1/2 or 50%."
