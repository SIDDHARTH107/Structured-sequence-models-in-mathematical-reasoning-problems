    "message_1": "A company employs an agent to manage a project. The agent's effort level can be high or low, and the success of the project depends on the agent's effort level. The agent's high effort level will result in a successful project with a probability of 0.9 and a failed project with a probability of 0.1. The agent's low effort level will result in a successful project with a probability of 0.6 and a failed project with a probability of 0.4.\n\nThe principal can offer the agent a bonus of $1000 if the project is successful, and a penalty of $2000 if the project fails. If the agent's payoff function is given by U(e), where e = {high effort, low effort}, and the principal's expected profit is maximized, what effort level should the agent choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effort level the agent should choose, we need to calculate the agent's expected payoff for both high effort and low effort, and then compare the two.\n\nFor high effort:\nExpected payoff = (probability of success * bonus) - (probability of failure * penalty)\nExpected payoff = (0.9 * $1000) - (0.1 * $2000)\nExpected payoff = $900 - $200\nExpected payoff = $700\n\nFor low effort:\nExpected payoff = (probability of success * bonus) - (probability of failure * penalty)\nExpected payoff = (0.6 * $1000) - (0.4 * $2000)\nExpected payoff = $600 - $800\nExpected payoff = -$200\n\nComparing the expected payoffs, the agent should choose the high effort level, as it results in a higher expected payoff ($700) compared to the low effort level (-$200)."
