    "message_1": "Let G1 and G2 be two graphs with G1 having 5 vertices and 7 edges, and G2 having 5 vertices and 8 edges. Determine whether or not G1 and G2 are isomorphic. If they are, provide an isomorphism between the two graphs.",
    "message_2": "G1 and G2 cannot be isomorphic because they have a different number of edges. For two graphs to be isomorphic, they must have the same number of vertices and edges, as well as a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency of vertices is preserved.\n\nSince G1 has 7 edges and G2 has 8 edges, they do not meet the criteria for isomorphism. Therefore, G1 and G2 are not isomorphic, and there is no isomorphism between the two graphs."
