    "message_2": "To determine the 95% confidence interval for the true mean score of the population using the bootstrapping method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples from the original sample (with replacement). In practice, we can use 1000 or more bootstrap samples.\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n3. Arrange the bootstrap sample means in ascending order.\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap sample means. These percentiles will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data to perform the bootstrapping, we can use the t-distribution to approximate the 95% confidence interval. The formula for the confidence interval using the t-distribution is:\n\nCI = x̄ ± t * (s / √n)\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- x̄ is the sample mean (85 in this case)\n- t is the t-score corresponding to the desired level of confidence (95% in this case) and degrees of freedom (n-1, which is 99 in this case)\n- s is the sample standard deviation (10 in this case)\n- n is the sample size (100 in this case)\n\nUsing a t-table or calculator, we find that the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 99 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.984.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 85 ± 1.984 * (10 / √100)\nCI = 85 ± 1.984 * (10 / 10)\nCI = 85 ± 1.984\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean score of the population is approximately (83.016, 86.984)."
