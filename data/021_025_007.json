    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to maximize the profit gained from the sale of two different products, A and B. The profit gained by selling each product is $20 for product A and $30 for product B. The production of product A requires two units of resource X and three units of resource Y, while the production of product B requires one unit of resource X and four units of resource Y. The company has 60 units of resource X and 48 units of resource Y available for production. Use whale optimization algorithm to determine the optimal production quantities of product A and B that maximizes the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. However, as a mathematician, I am unable to execute the WOA algorithm directly. Instead, I will provide you with a linear programming solution to this problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize): P = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints:\n2x + y <= 60 (resource X constraint)\n3x + 4y <= 48 (resource Y constraint)\nx >= 0 (non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny >= 0 (non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph.\n\n1. 2x + y <= 60\ny <= -2x + 60\n\n2. 3x + 4y <= 48\ny <= (-3/4)x + 12\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at points (0,0), (0,12), (20,0), and (8,6).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0,12) = 20(0) + 30(12) = $360\n3. P(20,0) = 20(20) + 30(0) = $400\n4. P(8,6) = 20(8) + 30(6) = $280\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (20,0), where the company should produce 20 units of product A and 0 units of product B. The maximum profit is $400."
