    "message_2": "To extend $f(z)$ to the lower half plane using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find an analytic function $g(z)$ that is equal to $f(z)$ on the real axis and is also analytic in the lower half plane. \n\nWe can define $g(z) = \\frac{1}{z+i}$, which is analytic in the lower half plane. Now, we need to find a function that is equal to $f(z)$ on the real axis and equal to $g(z)$ in the lower half plane. \n\nWe can define the function $h(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$h(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) = \\frac{1}{z-i}, & \\text{if } \\Im(z) \\geq 0 \\\\\ng(z) = \\frac{1}{z+i}, & \\text{if } \\Im(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nNow, we can verify that $h(z)$ is equal to $f(z)$ on the real axis:\n\n$$h(z) = \\frac{1}{z-i} = \\frac{1}{z+i}$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow (z-i)(z+i) = (z+i)(z-i)$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow z^2 - i^2 = z^2 - i^2$$\n\nThis equality holds for all $z$ on the real axis, so $h(z)$ is indeed equal to $f(z)$ on the real axis and equal to $g(z)$ in the lower half plane.\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of $h(z)$ at $z = -2$:\n\n$$h(-2) = \\frac{1}{-2+i}$$\n\nSince $-2$ is in the lower half plane, we use the definition of $g(z)$:\n\n$$h(-2) = \\frac{1}{-2+i} = \\frac{1}{-2+i} \\cdot \\frac{-2-i}{-2-i} = \\frac{-2-i}{(-2)^2 + i^2} = \\frac{-2-i}{4+1} = \\frac{-2-i}{5}$$\n\nSo, $f(-2) = h(-2) = \\frac{-2-i}{5}$."
