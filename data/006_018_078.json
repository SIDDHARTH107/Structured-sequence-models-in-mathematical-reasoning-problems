    "message_1": "A company has implemented several measures to prevent financial fraud. The probability that a fraud occurs in a given year is 0.1. If the company has 100 employees, what is the probability that at least one employee will commit fraud?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that at least one employee will commit fraud, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that no employee will commit fraud.\n\nThe probability that an employee does not commit fraud is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSince there are 100 employees, the probability that none of them commit fraud is (0.9)^100 ≈ 0.000026.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability that at least one employee will commit fraud.\n\nP(at least one employee commits fraud) = 1 - P(no employee commits fraud) = 1 - 0.000026 ≈ 0.999974.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one employee will commit fraud is approximately 0.999974 or 99.9974%."
