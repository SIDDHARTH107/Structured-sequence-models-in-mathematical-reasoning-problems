    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cylindrical tank using integration, we'll consider the tank as a series of infinitesimally thin disks stacked along the x-axis. Each disk has a radius of 3 meters and a thickness of dx meters. We'll integrate the volume of these disks from x = 0 to x = 10 meters.\n\nThe volume of a single disk is given by the formula:\n\ndV = π * r^2 * dx\n\nwhere dV is the infinitesimal volume, r is the radius of the disk (3 meters), and dx is the infinitesimal thickness of the disk.\n\nNow, we'll integrate this formula along the x-axis from 0 to 10 meters:\n\nV = ∫[0, 10] π * (3^2) * dx\n\nSince the radius is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nV = π * (3^2) * ∫[0, 10] dx\n\nNow, we'll integrate with respect to x:\n\nV = π * (3^2) * [x] from 0 to 10\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = π * (3^2) * (10 - 0)\n\nV = π * 9 * 10\n\nV = 90π cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of the cylindrical tank is 90π cubic meters, or approximately 283.53 cubic meters."
