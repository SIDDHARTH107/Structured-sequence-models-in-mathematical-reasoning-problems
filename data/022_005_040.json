    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of f(z) = (sin z)/z^2 around the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin using residue calculus, we first need to find the residues of the function at its singularities. The function has a singularity at z = 0.\n\nTo find the residue at z = 0, we can use the following formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order n:\n\nRes(f(z), z = 0) = (1/(n-1)!) * (d^(n-1)/dz^(n-1))[(z^n * f(z))]\n\nIn our case, n = 2, since we have a simple pole. So, we need to find the first derivative of z^2 * f(z) = sin z with respect to z:\n\nd/dz(sin z) = cos z\n\nNow, we can find the residue:\n\nRes(f(z), z = 0) = (1/(2-1)!) * (cos z) = cos(0) = 1\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral:\n\n∮f(z)dz = 2πi * (sum of residues)\n\nIn our case, there is only one residue, so the sum of residues is just 1. Therefore, the integral is:\n\n∮f(z)dz = 2πi * 1 = 2πi\n\nHowever, the integral we want to evaluate is a real integral, so we need to take the imaginary part of the result:\n\nIm(2πi) = -2π\n\nThus, the integral of f(z) = (sin z)/z^2 around the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin is approximately -6.283. However, this is not the correct answer, as the answer should be approximately -0.283.\n\nIt seems there might be a mistake in the given answer, or the problem statement might be incorrect."
