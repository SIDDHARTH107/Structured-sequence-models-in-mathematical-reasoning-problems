Use Double and Add algorithm to solve it. What is the resulting point in affine coordinates?",
    "message_2": "To find the result of 27A, we will use the double and add algorithm. We will first represent 27 in binary form, which is 11011. Now, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize the result R to the point at infinity (denoted as O).\n2. Iterate through the binary representation of 27 from left to right.\n3. For each bit, double the current value of R (using point doubling) and add A to R if the bit is 1 (using point addition).\n\nFirst, let's define the point doubling and point addition formulas for elliptic curves over a finite field:\n\nFor point doubling (2P = R):\n- λ = (3x₁² - 7) * (2y₁)⁻¹ mod 17\n- x₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂ mod 17\n- y₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ mod 17\n\nFor point addition (P + Q = R):\n- λ = (y₂ - y₁) * (x₂ - x₁)⁻¹ mod 17\n- x₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂ mod 17\n- y₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ mod 17\n\nNow, let's perform the double and add algorithm:\n\n1. R = O\n2. Iterate through the binary representation of 27 (11011):\n\n   - First bit (1): Double R (R = 2O = O) and add A (R = O + A = A = (7, 12))\n   - Second bit (1): Double R (R = 2A = (15, 6)) and add A (R = (15, 6) + A = (2, 7))\n   - Third bit (0): Double R (R = 2(2, 7) = (10, 6)), no addition since the bit is 0\n   - Fourth bit (1): Double R (R = 2(10, 6) = (6, 3)) and add A (R = (6, 3) + A = (13, 10))\n   - Fifth bit (1): Double R (R = 2(13, 10) = (9, 5)) and add A (R = (9, 5) + A = (3, 1))\n\nThe resulting point in affine coordinates is (3, 1)."
