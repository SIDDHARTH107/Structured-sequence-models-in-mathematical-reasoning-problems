    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of Set A and Set B:\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the union of Set A and Set B:\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of Set A and Set B by subtracting the intersection from the union:\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, to verify that the symmetric difference is commutative, we need to show that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference of Set B and Set A:\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nWe already know the union and intersection of Set A and Set B, which are the same as Set B and Set A:\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nB ∩ A = {3, 4, 5}\n\nSo, B Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nSince A Δ B = {1, 2, 6, 7} and B Δ A = {1, 2, 6, 7}, we can conclude that the symmetric difference is commutative."
