    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can first simplify the second equation. Since both terms in the second equation have a common factor of 2, we can divide the entire equation by 2:\n\n2x + 2y = 8\n(2x + 2y) / 2 = 8 / 2\nx + y = 4\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\nx + y = 4\nx + y = 4\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line in the coordinate plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system of equations. To express the solutions, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other:\n\nx = 4 - y\n\nNow, for any value of y, we can find the corresponding value of x that satisfies the equation. For example, if y = 0, then x = 4; if y = 1, then x = 3, and so on. The solutions can be represented as ordered pairs (x, y) or as the equation x = 4 - y."
