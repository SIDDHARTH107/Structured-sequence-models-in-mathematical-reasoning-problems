    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 6 vertices numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The edges of the graph G are as follows: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (4,5), and (5,6). Determine if there exists a perfect matching in G. If yes, identify the set of edges that form the perfect matching. If no, explain why.",
    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges such that every vertex in the graph is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In other words, each vertex is paired with another vertex through an edge, and no vertex is left unpaired.\n\nTo find a perfect matching in graph G, we can try to pair the vertices using the given edges:\n\n1. Start with vertex 1. We have two options for pairing it: (1,2) or (1,5).\n2. If we choose (1,2), then vertex 2 is paired with vertex 1. Now, we can pair vertex 3 with vertex 4 using edge (3,4). This leaves vertices 5 and 6, which can be paired using edge (5,6). So, one possible perfect matching is {(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)}.\n3. If we choose (1,5), then vertex 5 is paired with vertex 1. Now, we can pair vertex 2 with vertex 3 using edge (2,3). This leaves vertices 4 and 6, which can be paired using edge (2,6) and (4,5). However, this would mean that vertex 2 is incident to two edges in the matching, which is not allowed in a perfect matching. Therefore, there is no perfect matching in this case.\n\nSince we found a perfect matching in the first case, we can conclude that there exists a perfect matching in graph G, and the set of edges that form the perfect matching is {(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)}."
