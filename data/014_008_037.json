    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student:\n\nSuppose you have a 64-bit plaintext message that you want to encrypt using a block cipher with a block size of 128 bits. Using the DES block cipher algorithm, how many rounds of encryption would be needed to encrypt the plaintext message?",
    "message_2": "The DES (Data Encryption Standard) block cipher algorithm has a fixed block size of 64 bits and uses 16 rounds of encryption. However, the problem states that you want to encrypt a 64-bit plaintext message using a block cipher with a block size of 128 bits. DES is not suitable for this scenario, as it only supports a 64-bit block size.\n\nIf you still want to use DES for this problem, you could use a technique called \"Double DES\" or \"2DES,\" which involves applying DES twice with two different keys. This would result in an effective block size of 128 bits. In this case, since each DES encryption uses 16 rounds, you would need a total of 32 rounds (16 rounds for the first DES encryption and 16 rounds for the second DES encryption) to encrypt the 64-bit plaintext message."
