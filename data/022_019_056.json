    "message_2": "To solve the given integral equation, we can use the method of contour integration. Let's define a contour integral:\n\n$$F(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_C \\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a contour in the complex plane that encloses the real axis and is oriented counterclockwise. We can split the contour into two parts: one along the real axis, and one in the upper half-plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{t-z}$, where $z$ is a complex number with $-\\pi < \\textrm{Im}(z) < \\pi$. Since $f(t)$ is a complex-valued function, $g(t)$ is analytic everywhere except at $t = z$. We can apply Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed contour is zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\oint_C g(t)dt = 0$$\n\nNow, we can split the contour integral into two parts:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt + \\int_{C_+}\\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt = 0$$\n\nwhere $C_+$ is the contour in the upper half-plane. Since $-\\pi < \\textrm{Im}(z) < \\pi$, we can apply Jordan's lemma, which states that the integral over the contour in the upper half-plane goes to zero as the radius of the contour goes to infinity. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt = -\\int_{C_+}\\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into the original integral equation:\n\n$$f(z) = e^{2z} - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{C_+}\\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is analytic inside the contour $C$, we can apply Cauchy's integral formula, which states that:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_C \\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt$$\n\nComparing this with the expression for $F(z)$, we find that:\n\n$$f(z) = e^{2z} - F(z)$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for $F(z)$ back into the integral equation:\n\n$$f(z) = e^{2z} - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_C \\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is analytic inside the contour $C$, we can apply Cauchy's integral formula again:\n\n$$f(z) = e^{2z} - \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_C \\frac{f(t)}{t-z}dt$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z) = e^{2z}$$\n\nThis is the solution to the given integral equation for $-\\pi < \\textrm{Im}(z) < \\pi$."
