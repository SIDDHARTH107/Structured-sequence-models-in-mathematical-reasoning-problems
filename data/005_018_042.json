    "message_1": "A medical researcher wants to study the time it takes for a particular drug to have a significant effect on patients with a certain medical condition. She records the elapsed time in weeks until the drug shows a significant effect for each patient in her study. The data she collected is as follows: \n\n2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 15, 15, 15, 16, 18\n\nWhat is the median time (in weeks) it takes for the drug to show a significant effect on a patient with this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To find the median, we first need to make sure the data is sorted in ascending order, which it is. Since there are 20 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe two middle values are the 10th and 11th values, which are 10 and 11. To find the average of these two values, we add them together and divide by 2:\n\n(10 + 11) / 2 = 21 / 2 = 10.5\n\nSo, the median time it takes for the drug to show a significant effect on a patient with this medical condition is 10.5 weeks."
