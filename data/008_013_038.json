    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the LU decomposition method, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\nx + 2y + z = 8  (1)\n2x + 8y + 9z = 29  (2)\n3x + 12y + 10z = 32  (3)\n\nThe coefficient matrix A is:\n\nA = | 1  2  1 |\n    | 2  8  9 |\n    | 3 12 10 |\n\nPerforming LU decomposition:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |      U = | 1  2   1  |\n    | 2  1  0 |          | 0  4   7  |\n    | 3  2  1 |          | 0  0  -1  |\n\nNow, we will solve the system LY = B, where B is the constant matrix [8, 29, 32]^T.\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   |  8  |\n| 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 29  |\n| 3  2  1 | | y3 |   | 32  |\n\nSolving for Y:\n\ny1 = 8\ny2 = 29 - 2 * y1 = 13\ny3 = 32 - 3 * y1 - 2 * y2 = -1\n\nNow, we will solve the system UX = Y.\n\n| 1  2   1  | | x |   |  8  |\n| 0  4   7  | | y | = | 13  |\n| 0  0  -1  | | z |   | -1  |\n\nSolving for X:\n\nz = -1 / -1 = 1\ny = (13 - 7 * z) / 4 = 2\nx = 8 - 2 * y - z = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
