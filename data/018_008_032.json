    "message_1": "Suppose set A = {1, 2} and set B = {3, 4}. Calculate the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. Then, calculate the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A. Show that these two Cartesian products are not equal and hence prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartesian product of A and B (A × B), we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. \n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian product of B and A (B × A). This time, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that they are not equal:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} ≠ {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)} = B × A\n\nSince A × B ≠ B × A, we have shown that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
