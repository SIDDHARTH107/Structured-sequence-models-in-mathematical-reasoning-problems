    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, player 1 is given X dollars and must offer a share of it to player 2. Player 2 can either accept the offer and both players keep their respective shares, or reject the offer and both players receive nothing. If player 2 rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. Suppose X = $100 and player 1 offers player 2 $25, what should be the minimum amount of money that player 2 would accept?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum amount of money that player 2 would accept depends on their individual preferences and rationality. From a purely rational perspective, player 2 should accept any amount greater than $0, as receiving something is better than receiving nothing. However, in practice, people often consider fairness and may reject offers they perceive as unfair.\n\nThere is no specific mathematical answer to the minimum amount player 2 would accept, as it depends on their personal preferences and perception of fairness."
