    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's denote the integer we are looking for as x.\n\nWe have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 4)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 4 * 5 * 7 = 140.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N/4 = 140/4 = 35\nN2 = N/5 = 140/5 = 28\nN3 = N/7 = 140/7 = 20\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses:\n\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 4) = 35^(-1) (mod 4) = 3 (since 3 * 35 ≡ 1 (mod 4))\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 5) = 28^(-1) (mod 5) = 3 (since 3 * 28 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 7) = 20^(-1) (mod 7) = 4 (since 4 * 20 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nFinally, we can compute the solution:\n\nx = (1 * 35 * 3) + (2 * 28 * 3) + (3 * 20 * 4) = 105 + 168 + 240 = 513\n\nHowever, we need to find the smallest positive integer, so we take the result modulo N:\n\nx = 513 (mod 140) = 93\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 93."
