    "message_2": "To prove the existence of a normal subgroup H of G of order 8 or 16, we will use Sylow's Theorems. Let G be a group of order 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 * 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15. \n\nIf n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. Let H be this Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the order of H is 2^3 = 8, we have found a normal subgroup of order 8, and we are done in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_2 = 3 or 15. In this case, there is no unique Sylow 2-subgroup, so we cannot directly conclude the existence of a normal subgroup of order 8 or 16. However, we can use the fact that the Sylow 2-subgroups are conjugate to each other. Let P, Q, and R be three distinct Sylow 2-subgroups. Then, there exist g, h in G such that gPg^{-1} = Q and hPh^{-1} = R. \n\nConsider the intersection of P and Q, denoted by P ∩ Q. Since P and Q are both of order 8, the order of P ∩ Q must be a power of 2. If |P ∩ Q| = 4, then P ∩ Q is a normal subgroup of G of order 4, and we can find a normal subgroup of order 8 or 16 by considering the normalizer of P ∩ Q in G. \n\nIf |P ∩ Q| = 2, then P ∩ Q is a normal subgroup of G of order 2. Let K = P ∩ Q. Since K is normal in G, we can form the quotient group G/K. Note that |G/K| = 60. Now, G/K has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, say L/K, where L is a subgroup of G containing K. Since L/K is normal in G/K, L is normal in G. Moreover, |L| = 2^2 * |K| = 8 or 2^3 * |K| = 16. Thus, we have found a normal subgroup of G of order 8 or 16.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when H has order 16. In this case, G/H is isomorphic to a group of order 120/16 = 15, which is isomorphic to C3 × C5. Since G/H is abelian, G' (the derived subgroup of G) is a subgroup of H. Note that |G'| divides |H| = 16, so |G'| = 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.\n\nIf |G'| = 1, then G is abelian, which contradicts the fact that G is isomorphic to one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. If |G'| = 2 or 4, then G/G' is isomorphic to a group of order 120/2 = 60 or 120/4 = 30, respectively. In both cases, G/G' is isomorphic to a non-abelian simple group, which must be A5. Thus, G is an extension of A5 by a group of order 2 or 4. Since A5 has no non-trivial normal subgroups, the only possible extension is the direct product A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nIf |G'| = 8 or 16, then G is isomorphic to one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120, as desired."
