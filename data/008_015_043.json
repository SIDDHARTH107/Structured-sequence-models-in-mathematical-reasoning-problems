    "message_2": "First, we need to write the system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the column vector of constants (18, 33, 33).\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 2  5  2 |\n    | 3  2  6 |\n\nb = | 18 |\n    | 33 |\n    | 33 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition is a method to decompose a symmetric positive-definite matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, such that A = LL^T.\n\n1. Calculate L11: L11 = sqrt(A11) = sqrt(1) = 1\n2. Calculate L21 and L31: L21 = A21 / L11 = 2 / 1 = 2, L31 = A31 / L11 = 3 / 1 = 3\n3. Calculate L22: L22 = sqrt(A22 - L21^2) = sqrt(5 - 2^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\n4. Calculate L32: L32 = (A32 - L31 * L21) / L22 = (2 - 3 * 2) / 1 = -4\n5. Calculate L33: L33 = sqrt(A33 - L31^2 - L32^2) = sqrt(6 - 3^2 - (-4)^2) = sqrt(6 - 9 - 16) = sqrt(-19)\n\nSince we got a negative value under the square root for L33, the matrix A is not positive-definite, and Cholesky decomposition cannot be applied to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nIn this case, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or Cramer's rule to find the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of equations."
