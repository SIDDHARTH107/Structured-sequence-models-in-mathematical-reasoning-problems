    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted as A', consists of all the elements in U that are not in A. Let's assume that U is the set of all integers from 1 to 10:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A by identifying the elements in U that are not in A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nTo prove that the complement of A is unique, we need to show that there cannot be another set B' that is also the complement of A. Suppose there exists another set B' that is the complement of A. Then, B' must also contain all the elements in U that are not in A. This means that B' must be equal to A', as both sets contain the same elements.\n\nSince there cannot be another set that contains the same elements as A' and is also the complement of A, we can conclude that the complement of A is unique."
