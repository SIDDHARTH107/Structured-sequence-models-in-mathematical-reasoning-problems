    "message_2": "A Latin square of order 4 is a 4x4 grid where each number from 1 to 4 appears exactly once in each row and column. To count the number of distinct Latin squares of order 4, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways. However, since the Latin squares are considered distinct up to a permutation of the symbols (i.e., we can rearrange the numbers without changing the structure of the Latin square), we can fix the first row as (1, 2, 3, 4) without loss of generality.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining numbers, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. However, we can fix the second row's first element as 2 (again, without loss of generality), which leaves 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining numbers in the second row, which is 2 × 1 = 2 ways.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possible ways to place the numbers, and for the fourth row, there is only 1 way left (since it is determined by the previous rows).\n\nMultiplying the possibilities for each row, we get:\n\n1 (first row) × 2 (second row) × 2 (third row) × 1 (fourth row) = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 distinct Latin squares of order 4."
