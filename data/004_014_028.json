    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cylinder, we use the formula V = πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 meters and the height (h) is 10 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = π(5²)(10)\nV = π(25)(10)\nV = 250π\n\nTo round the answer to the nearest tenth, we can approximate π as 3.14:\n\nV ≈ 250 * 3.14\nV ≈ 785\n\nSo, the cylindrical tank can hold approximately 785 cubic meters of liquid."
