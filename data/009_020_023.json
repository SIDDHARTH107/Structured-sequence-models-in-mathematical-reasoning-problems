    "message_1": "A spring having a mass of 0.5 kg is attached to a wall, and to another mass of 1.5 kg that is initially at rest on a frictionless surface. The spring is compressed by 0.1m and then released. The motion of the system is governed by the differential equation: \n\nm(d^2x/dt^2) + kx = 0\n\nwhere m is the total mass of the system and k is the spring constant.\n\nWhat is the period of oscillation of the system? Assume k = 20 N/m.",
    "message_2": "To find the period of oscillation of the system, we can use the formula for the period of a mass-spring system:\n\nT = 2π√(m/k)\n\nwhere T is the period, m is the total mass of the system, and k is the spring constant.\n\nGiven the mass of the spring (0.5 kg) and the mass attached to it (1.5 kg), the total mass of the system is:\n\nm = 0.5 kg + 1.5 kg = 2 kg\n\nThe spring constant k is given as 20 N/m.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nT = 2π√(2 kg / 20 N/m)\n\nT = 2π√(1/10)\n\nT = 2π√(0.1)\n\nT ≈ 2π(0.316)\n\nT ≈ 1.99 s\n\nThe period of oscillation of the system is approximately 1.99 seconds."
