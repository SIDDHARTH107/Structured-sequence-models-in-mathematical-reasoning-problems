    "message_2": "To find the probability of experiencing a flood and a tornado in the same year, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event occurring independently.\n\nThe probability of a flood occurring in any given year is 1 in 10, or 1/10.\nThe probability of a tornado occurring in any given year is 1 in 20, or 1/20.\n\nNow, we multiply these probabilities together:\n\n(1/10) * (1/20) = 1/200\n\nSo, the probability of experiencing a flood and a tornado in the same year is 1 in 200, or 0.005 (0.5%)."
