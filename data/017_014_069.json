Show that either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, or it is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, or it is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20 by finding the elements and operation of each group, and checking all the axioms of a group that hold for the given operation.",
    "message_2": "First, let's recall the axioms of a group:\n\n1. Closure: For all elements a, b in G, the result of the operation a * b is also in G.\n2. Associativity: For all elements a, b, c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n3. Identity element: There exists an element e in G such that for every element a in G, e * a = a * e = a.\n4. Inverse element: For every element a in G, there exists an element a' in G such that a * a' = a' * a = e.\n\nNow let's consider the three groups mentioned:\n\n1. Cyclic group C20: The elements of C20 are {0, 1, 2, ..., 19}, and the operation is addition modulo 20. It is easy to check that all group axioms hold for this operation. The identity element is 0, and the inverse of an element a is 20 - a.\n\n2. Dihedral group D10: The elements of D10 can be represented as {r^i, r^i * s | 0 ≤ i ≤ 9}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The operation is composition of transformations. The identity element is r^0, and the inverse of an element r^i is r^(10 - i), while the inverse of r^i * s is r^i * s. All group axioms hold for this operation.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 20: Let's consider a group with elements {1, a, a^2, ..., a^9, b, b * a, b * a^2, ..., b * a^9}, where a has order 10 and b has order 2, and the operation is defined as follows:\n\n- a^i * a^j = a^(i + j) (mod 10)\n- a^i * b * a^j = b * a^(i + j) (mod 10) for i, j = 0, 1, ..., 9\n- b * a^i * b = a^(-i) (mod 10) for i = 0, 1, ..., 9\n\nThe identity element is 1, and the inverse of an element a^i is a^(10 - i), while the inverse of b * a^i is b * a^(-i). All group axioms hold for this operation.\n\nIn conclusion, any group G of order 20 must be isomorphic to one of these three groups: the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20."
