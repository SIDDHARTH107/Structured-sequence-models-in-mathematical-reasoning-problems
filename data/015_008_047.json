    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant (Î´) is a universal constant that appears in the study of bifurcations in chaotic systems. It is defined as the limiting ratio of successive intervals between bifurcation parameter values as they approach the onset of chaos. The Feigenbaum constant is approximately equal to 4.6692.\n\nHowever, the given bifurcation parameter value of 3.5607 does not provide enough information to directly determine the corresponding value of the Feigenbaum constant. The Feigenbaum constant is a universal constant and does not change based on the bifurcation parameter value. It remains approximately 4.6692 for all chaotic systems."
