    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the graph, we first need to understand the concept of tree decomposition and treewidth.\n\nA tree decomposition of an undirected graph G is a tree T where each node i of T is associated with a subset of vertices of G, called a bag, such that:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the vertex set of G.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in G, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. If a vertex v is in the bags of nodes i and j, then v is also in the bag of every node on the path between i and j in T.\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. The treewidth of a graph is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions of the graph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges. The maximum number of edges in a tree with 8 vertices is 7 (since a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges). Since our graph has 10 edges, it must contain at least one cycle.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario, where the graph has a cycle of length 4 (a square) and the remaining 4 vertices form a star connected to one of the vertices of the square. In this case, we can construct a tree decomposition as follows:\n\n1. Create a bag containing the 4 vertices of the square.\n2. Create 4 additional bags, each containing one of the remaining vertices and one of the vertices of the square.\n\nThe tree decomposition will have a width of 4 - 1 = 3. Since this is the worst-case scenario, the treewidth of the graph is at most 3.\n\nNow, we need to show that the treewidth is at least 3. To do this, we can use the fact that the treewidth of a graph is at least the size of the largest clique minus 1. A clique is a complete subgraph, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In our worst-case scenario, the square is a clique of size 4. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph is at least 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nSince the treewidth is at most 3 and at least 3, the treewidth of the graph is 3."
