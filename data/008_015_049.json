    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the Cholesky decomposition method, we first need to check if the given matrix is symmetric and positive definite.\n\nThe given matrix A is:\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 2  5  6 |\n    | 3  6  9 |\n\nMatrix A is symmetric, as A = A^T. Now, let's check if it is positive definite. A matrix is positive definite if all its leading principal minors have positive determinants.\n\n1) The first leading principal minor is just the (1,1) element: det(1) = 1 > 0\n2) The second leading principal minor is the upper left 2x2 submatrix:\n   | 1  2 |\n   | 2  5 |\n   det(1  2) = 1 * 5 - 2 * 2 = 1 > 0\n   (2  5)\n3) The third leading principal minor is the entire matrix A:\n   det(A) = | 1  2  3 | = 1 * | 5  6 | - 2 * | 2  6 | + 3 * | 2  5 | = 0\n            | 2  5  6 |        | 3  9 |       | 3  9 |       | 3  6 |\n            | 3  6  9 |\n\nSince the determinant of the entire matrix A is 0, the matrix is not positive definite. Therefore, we cannot use the Cholesky decomposition method to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nHowever, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to solve this system."
