    "message_1": "In a Stackelberg competition, a leader firm and a follower firm compete in the market. Suppose the leader firm has a marginal cost of $10 and the follower firm has a marginal cost of $20. The inverse demand curve is p = 100 - Q, where Q = q1 + q2 is the total quantity produced by both firms. \n\nIf the leader firm has a production capacity of 100 units, what quantity will it produce in order to maximize its profit and what will be its profit? What quantity will the follower produce and what will be its profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction functions for both the leader and the follower firms. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity produced by each firm given the quantity produced by the other firm. \n\nFirst, let's find the reaction function for the follower firm (Firm 2). The profit function for Firm 2 is:\n\nπ2 = (p - MC2) * q2 = (100 - Q - 20) * q2 = (80 - q1 - q2) * q2\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 2 will choose q2 such that its marginal profit is equal to its marginal cost:\n\ndπ2/dq2 = 80 - q1 - 2q2 = 20 (since MC2 = 20)\n\nSolving for q2, we get the reaction function for Firm 2:\n\nq2 = (60 - q1) / 2\n\nNow let's find the reaction function for the leader firm (Firm 1). The profit function for Firm 1 is:\n\nπ1 = (p - MC1) * q1 = (100 - Q - 10) * q1 = (90 - q1 - q2) * q1\n\nSince Firm 1 is the leader, it will take into account the reaction function of Firm 2 when choosing its optimal quantity. Therefore, we can substitute the reaction function of Firm 2 into the profit function of Firm 1:\n\nπ1 = (90 - q1 - ((60 - q1) / 2)) * q1\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 1 will choose q1 such that its marginal profit is equal to its marginal cost:\n\ndπ1/dq1 = 90 - 2q1 - (60 - q1) = 10 (since MC1 = 10)\n\nSolving for q1, we get:\n\nq1 = 40\n\nNow we can find the optimal quantity for Firm 2 using its reaction function:\n\nq2 = (60 - q1) / 2 = (60 - 40) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10\n\nNow that we have the optimal quantities for both firms, we can find their profits. For Firm 1:\n\nπ1 = (90 - q1 - q2) * q1 = (90 - 40 - 10) * 40 = 50 * 40 = 2000\n\nFor Firm 2:\n\nπ2 = (80 - q1 - q2) * q2 = (80 - 40 - 10) * 10 = 30 * 10 = 300\n\nSo, the leader firm (Firm 1) will produce 40 units and have a profit of $2000, while the follower firm (Firm 2) will produce 10 units and have a profit of $300."
