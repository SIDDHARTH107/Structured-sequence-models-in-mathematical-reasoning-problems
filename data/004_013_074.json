    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 15x^2 + 36x - 7 for x between 0 and 5, we need to first find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 30x + 36\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x^2 - 30x + 36 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 6:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to check the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 5]:\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^3 - 15(0)^2 + 36(0) - 7 = -7\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 15(2)^2 + 36(2) - 7 = -15\nf(3) = 2(3)^3 - 15(3)^2 + 36(3) - 7 = -16\nf(5) = 2(5)^3 - 15(5)^2 + 36(5) - 7 = 28\n\nComparing the values, we find that the maximum value of the function is 28 at x = 5, and the minimum value of the function is -16 at x = 3."
