    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the production costs of a product by adjusting the values of two parameters X and Y. The production cost equation includes the parameters as follows:\n\nCost = 10X^2 + 12XY + 8Y^2 - 500X - 400Y + 2400\n\nUsing Particle Swarm Optimization, find the values of X and Y that minimize the production cost. Use a swarm size of 20, inertia weight of 0.7, cognitive weight of 1.5, and social weight of 1.5.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm with random positions and velocities for each particle.\n2. Calculate the fitness (cost) of each particle.\n3. Update the personal best (pBest) and global best (gBest) positions.\n4. Update the velocities and positions of each particle.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nSince I cannot execute code, I will provide you with a Python code that you can run to find the optimal values of X and Y using PSO:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef cost_function(X, Y):\n    return 10 * X**2 + 12 * X * Y + 8 * Y**2 - 500 * X - 400 * Y + 2400\n\ndef pso(swarm_size, inertia_weight, cognitive_weight, social_weight, max_iterations):\n    np.random.seed(0)\n    particles = np.random.uniform(-10, 10, (swarm_size, 2))\n    velocities = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (swarm_size, 2))\n    pBest = particles.copy()\n    gBest = particles[np.argmin([cost_function(x, y) for x, y in particles])]\n\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        for i in range(swarm_size):\n            r1, r2 = np.random.rand(2)\n            velocities[i] = (inertia_weight * velocities[i] +\n                             cognitive_weight * r1 * (pBest[i] - particles[i]) +\n                             social_weight * r2 * (gBest - particles[i]))\n            particles[i] += velocities[i]\n\n            if cost_function(*particles[i]) < cost_function(*pBest[i]):\n                pBest[i] = particles[i]\n\n        gBest = particles[np.argmin([cost_function(x, y) for x, y in particles])]\n\n    return gBest\n\nswarm_size = 20\ninertia_weight = 0.7\ncognitive_weight = 1.5\nsocial_weight = 1.5\nmax_iterations = 100\n\noptimal_values = pso(swarm_size, inertia_weight, cognitive_weight, social_weight, max_iterations)\nprint(f\"Optimal values of X and Y: {optimal_values}\")\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a Python environment to find the optimal values of X and Y that minimize the production cost using PSO with the given parameters."
