    "message_2": "In simply typed lambda calculus, the term `λx:ℕ→ℕ. x 0` represents a function that takes a function `x` of type `ℕ→ℕ` as input and applies it to the natural number `0`. \n\nTo find the type of this term, we can analyze it step by step:\n\n1. `x` has the type `ℕ→ℕ`.\n2. `0` has the type `ℕ`.\n3. `x 0` applies the function `x` to the argument `0`, so it has the type `ℕ` (since `x` is a function from `ℕ` to `ℕ`).\n4. `λx:ℕ→ℕ. x 0` is a function that takes an input `x` of type `ℕ→ℕ` and returns a value of type `ℕ`.\n\nSo, the type of the term `λx:ℕ→ℕ. x 0` is `(ℕ→ℕ)→ℕ`."
