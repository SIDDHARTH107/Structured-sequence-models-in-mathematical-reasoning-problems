    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions for the Diophantine equation $$4x + 7y = 15$$, we can first find a particular solution and then use the general form of Diophantine equations to find all other solutions.\n\nStep 1: Find a particular solution\nWe can start by finding a single solution (x, y) that satisfies the equation. One way to do this is by trial and error. For example, if we let x = 1, we get:\n\n$$4(1) + 7y = 15$$\n$$7y = 11$$\n\nSince 11 is not divisible by 7, there is no integer solution for y when x = 1. Now, let's try x = 2:\n\n$$4(2) + 7y = 15$$\n$$8 + 7y = 15$$\n$$7y = 7$$\n$$y = 1$$\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x, y) = (2, 1).\n\nStep 2: Find the general form of the solution\nNow that we have a particular solution, we can use the general form of Diophantine equations to find all other solutions. The general form is:\n\n$$x = x_0 + \\frac{b}{\\gcd(a, b)}t$$\n$$y = y_0 - \\frac{a}{\\gcd(a, b)}t$$\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is the particular solution we found, a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the equation (4 and 7 in this case), gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b, and t is an integer.\n\nSince gcd(4, 7) = 1, the general form for this equation is:\n\n$$x = 2 + 7t$$\n$$y = 1 - 4t$$\n\nStep 3: Find all integer solutions\nNow we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different values of t:\n\n- For t = 0, (x, y) = (2, 1)\n- For t = 1, (x, y) = (9, -3)\n- For t = -1, (x, y) = (-5, 5)\n\nAnd so on. The solutions will continue in this pattern for all integer values of t."
