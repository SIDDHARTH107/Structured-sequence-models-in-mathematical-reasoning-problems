    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but deontic logic is a branch of philosophical logic and it does not involve numerical problems that can be solved by math students. Deontic logic deals with concepts such as permission, obligation, and prohibition in a logical framework rather than solving numerical problems.",
    "message_2": "Thank you for the information about deontic logic. If you have any mathematical problems or questions, please feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help you with them."
