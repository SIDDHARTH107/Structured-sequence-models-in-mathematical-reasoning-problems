    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of nodes such that no two nodes in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). To find the maximum number of nodes in an independent set, we can use the fact that the sum of the sizes of a maximum independent set and a minimum vertex cover is equal to the total number of nodes in the graph. This is known as the Gallai-Edmonds theorem.\n\nA vertex cover is a set of nodes such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one node in the set. In other words, if we remove the nodes in the vertex cover, there will be no edges left in the graph. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest such set.\n\nFor a graph with 10 nodes and 15 edges, let's first find an upper bound on the size of the minimum vertex cover. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete bipartite graph, which means it can be divided into two disjoint sets of nodes such that every node in one set is connected to every node in the other set. The complete bipartite graph with 15 edges is K(5,5), which has 5 nodes in each set and 5*5=25 edges. However, our graph has only 15 edges, so it cannot be a complete bipartite graph.\n\nNow, let's consider the graph with the maximum number of edges that is not a complete bipartite graph. This graph is K(6,4), which has 6 nodes in one set and 4 nodes in the other set, and 6*4=24 edges. To reduce the number of edges to 15, we can remove 9 edges from this graph. In the worst case, we can remove 9 edges in such a way that the graph still has a vertex cover of size 6 (e.g., by removing 3 edges incident to each of the 3 nodes in the larger set).\n\nTherefore, the upper bound on the size of the minimum vertex cover is 6. By the Gallai-Edmonds theorem, the maximum size of an independent set is the total number of nodes minus the size of the minimum vertex cover, which is 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nSo, the maximum number of nodes that can be in an independent set of G is 4."
