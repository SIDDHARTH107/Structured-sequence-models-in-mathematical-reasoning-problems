    "message_2": "To perform a principal component analysis (PCA) and determine the percentage of variation explained by the first two principal components, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data: Since the subject scores may have different scales, we need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each subject.\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix: The covariance matrix represents the relationships between the subjects. It is a 6x6 matrix, as there are 6 subjects.\n\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix: The eigenvalues represent the amount of variation explained by each principal component, and the eigenvectors represent the direction of the principal components in the original data space.\n\n4. Sort the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors in descending order: The first principal component corresponds to the largest eigenvalue, the second principal component corresponds to the second largest eigenvalue, and so on.\n\n5. Calculate the percentage of variation explained by the first two principal components: Divide the sum of the first two eigenvalues by the sum of all eigenvalues, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nWithout the actual dataset, we cannot perform these calculations. However, once you have the dataset, you can follow these steps to perform PCA and determine the percentage of variation explained by the first two principal components."
