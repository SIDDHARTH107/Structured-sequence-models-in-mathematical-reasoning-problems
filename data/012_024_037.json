    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nWe are given that V = 8 and E = 12. We need to find the minimum genus g for which the graph can be embedded without crossings.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of edges E_max for a planar graph with 8 vertices:\n\nE_max = 3V - 6 = 3 * 8 - 6 = 18\n\nSince E = 12 < E_max, it is possible that the graph is planar (g = 0). However, we need to check if it satisfies the Euler's formula for planar graphs.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to find the number of faces:\n\nF = 2 - 2g + E - V = 2 - 2 * 0 + 12 - 8 = 6\n\nNow, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\n12 ≤ 3 * 8 - 6\n\n12 ≤ 18\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph is planar, and the genus of the graph is g = 0."
