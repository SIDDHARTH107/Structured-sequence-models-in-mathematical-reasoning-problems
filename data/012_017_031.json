    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex.\n\nIn a complete graph with 6 vertices, we can find the number of perfect matchings using the formula for the number of perfect matchings in a complete graph with an even number of vertices:\n\nNumber of perfect matchings = (2n - 1)!! = (2 * 6 - 1)!!\n\nHere, \"!!\" denotes the double factorial, which is the product of all the odd integers up to the given number.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nNumber of perfect matchings = (11)!! = 11 * 9 * 7 * 5 * 3 * 1 = 10395\n\nTherefore, there are 10,395 perfect matchings in a complete graph with 6 vertices."
