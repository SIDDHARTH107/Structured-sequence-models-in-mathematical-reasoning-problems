    "message_1": "A spring-mass system is described by the differential equation: \n\nm𝑦′′ + k𝑦 = 0\n\nwhere 𝑚 is the mass of the object attached to the spring, 𝑦 is the vertical displacement of the object from its equilibrium position, 𝑘 is the spring constant. \n\nIf the mass is 5 kg and the spring constant is 50 N/m, and the initial displacement of the object is 𝑦(0) = 1 m and the initial velocity is 𝑦′(0) = 0 m/s. What is the displacement of the object after 4 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation:\n\nm𝑦′′ + k𝑦 = 0\n\nGiven that the mass m = 5 kg and the spring constant k = 50 N/m, the equation becomes:\n\n5𝑦′′ + 50𝑦 = 0\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n𝑦′′ + 10𝑦 = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\nr^2 + 10 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = ±√(-10) = ±√(10)i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution for the displacement function is given by:\n\n𝑦(t) = C1 * cos(√10 * t) + C2 * sin(√10 * t)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants C1 and C2 using the initial conditions:\n\n1) 𝑦(0) = 1 m\n2) 𝑦′(0) = 0 m/s\n\nApplying the first initial condition:\n\n𝑦(0) = C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0) => 1 = C1\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of 𝑦(t):\n\n𝑦′(t) = -C1 * √10 * sin(√10 * t) + C2 * √10 * cos(√10 * t)\n\nApplying the second initial condition:\n\n𝑦′(0) = -C1 * √10 * sin(0) + C2 * √10 * cos(0) => 0 = C2 * √10\n\nSo, C2 = 0.\n\nNow we have the particular solution:\n\n𝑦(t) = cos(√10 * t)\n\nFinally, we can find the displacement of the object after 4 seconds:\n\n𝑦(4) = cos(√10 * 4) ≈ -0.8391 m\n\nTherefore, the displacement of the object after 4 seconds is approximately -0.8391 meters."
