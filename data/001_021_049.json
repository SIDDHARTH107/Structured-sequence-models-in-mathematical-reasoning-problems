    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial or use numerical methods. In this case, we can factor the polynomial using the Rational Root Theorem, which states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, -6) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nThe factors of -6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. Since the leading coefficient is 1, we only need to test these factors as possible rational roots. We can use synthetic division or direct substitution to test these factors.\n\nTesting the factors, we find that x = 1 is a root of the polynomial, as (1)^3 + 2(1)^2 - 5(1) - 6 = 0. Now we can perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor.\n\nUsing synthetic division with x = 1:\n\n```\n  1  |  1  2  -5  -6\n      |     1   3   2\n      ----------------\n        1  3  -2  -4\n```\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is x^2 + 3x - 2. We can now factor this quadratic or use the quadratic formula to find the remaining roots.\n\nFactoring the quadratic, we get (x + 2)(x + 1). So the remaining roots are x = -2 and x = -1.\n\nThus, the solutions to the polynomial equation x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0 are x = 1, x = -2, and x = -1."
