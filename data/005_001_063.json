    "message_1": "What is the p-value for a hypothesis test with a null hypothesis of  ùúá = 50, alternative hypothesis of ùúá ‚â† 50, sample mean of 55, sample standard deviation of 10, and a sample size of 25 with a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To find the p-value for this hypothesis test, we first need to calculate the test statistic (t-score or z-score). Since we have the sample standard deviation, we will use the t-score. \n\n1. Calculate the t-score:\nt = (sample mean - null hypothesis mean) / (sample standard deviation / ‚àösample size)\nt = (55 - 50) / (10 / ‚àö25)\nt = 5 / 2\nt = 2.5\n\n2. Determine the degrees of freedom (df):\ndf = sample size - 1\ndf = 25 - 1\ndf = 24\n\n3. Find the p-value using a t-distribution table or calculator:\nSince the alternative hypothesis is ùúá ‚â† 50, we are conducting a two-tailed test. We will look up the t-score (2.5) in a t-distribution table or use a calculator to find the area in both tails.\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the area in one tail is approximately 0.0107. Since it's a two-tailed test, we need to multiply this value by 2 to get the p-value.\n\np-value = 2 * 0.0107\np-value ‚âà 0.0214\n\nThe p-value is approximately 0.0214. Since the p-value (0.0214) is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis."
