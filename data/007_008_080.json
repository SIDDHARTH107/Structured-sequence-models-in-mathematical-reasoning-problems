    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nIn our case, p = 13 (which is a prime number) and a = 7. So, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, 7^13 ≡ 7 (mod 13).\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 7^35 is divided by 13. We can rewrite 7^35 as (7^13)^2 * 7^9.\n\nSince 7^13 ≡ 7 (mod 13), we can substitute this into our expression:\n\n(7^13)^2 * 7^9 ≡ (7)^2 * 7^9 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n\n7^2 * 7^9 ≡ 49 * 7^9 (mod 13)\n\nWe can find the remainder of 49 when divided by 13, which is 10:\n\n10 * 7^9 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem again:\n\n7^13 ≡ 7 (mod 13)\n\nWe can rewrite 7^9 as (7^13)^0 * 7^9:\n\n10 * (7^13)^0 * 7^9 ≡ 10 * 1 * 7^9 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n10 * 7^9 (mod 13)\n\nWe can rewrite 7^9 as (7^13)^0 * 7^9:\n\n10 * (7^13)^0 * 7^9 ≡ 10 * 1 * 7^9 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n10 * 7^9 (mod 13)\n\nWe can rewrite 7^9 as 7^6 * 7^3:\n\n10 * 7^6 * 7^3 (mod 13)\n\nUsing Fermat's Little Theorem again, we know that 7^13 ≡ 7 (mod 13), so 7^6 ≡ 1 (mod 13) since 7^6 is half of 7^13:\n\n10 * 1 * 7^3 ≡ 10 * 7^3 (mod 13)\n\nNow we just need to find the remainder when 10 * 7^3 is divided by 13:\n\n10 * 343 ≡ 3430 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when 3430 is divided by 13:\n\n3430 ≡ 8 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^35 is divided by 13 is 8."
