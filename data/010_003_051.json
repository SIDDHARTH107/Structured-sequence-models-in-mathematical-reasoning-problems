    "message_2": "A topology on a set X is said to be T_1 (also known as a Frechet space) if for every pair of distinct points x, y in X, there exists an open set containing x but not y, and an open set containing y but not x.\n\nLet's check if this condition holds for the given topology on X:\n\n1. For x = a and y = b, we have open sets {a} and {b} that separate them.\n2. For x = a and y = c, we have open sets {a} and {c, d} that separate them.\n3. For x = a and y = d, we have open sets {a} and {c, d} that separate them.\n4. For x = b and y = c, we have open sets {b} and {c, d} that separate them.\n5. For x = b and y = d, we have open sets {b} and {c, d} that separate them.\n\nHowever, for x = c and y = d, we cannot find open sets that separate them. All open sets containing c also contain d, and all open sets containing d also contain c.\n\nSince we cannot find open sets that separate the points c and d, the given topology on X is not T_1."
