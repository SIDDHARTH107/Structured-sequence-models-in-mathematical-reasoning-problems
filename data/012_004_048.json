    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the graph you are referring to. However, I can explain the steps to find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm. Please provide the nodes and edges with their respective weights, and I will help you find the minimum spanning tree.\n\nHere are the steps for Kruskal's algorithm:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Initialize an empty set to store the edges of the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Iterate through the sorted edges and add the edge to the set if it does not form a cycle with the edges already in the set.\n4. Continue adding edges until the set contains (number of nodes - 1) edges or all the edges have been considered.\n\nOnce you provide the graph details, I can help you find the minimum spanning tree using these steps."
