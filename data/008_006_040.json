    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[5 - λ, -1], [2, 6 - λ]]\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\n|A - λI| = (5 - λ)(6 - λ) - (-1)(2) = λ^2 - 11λ + 28\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 11λ + 28 = 0\n\nBy factoring, we get:\n\n(λ - 4)(λ - 7) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 4 and λ2 = 7.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\n1) For λ1 = 4:\n\n(A - 4I)v1 = 0\n[[1, -1], [2, 2]]v1 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we get the equation:\n\nv1 - v2 = 0 => v1 = v2\n\nLet v1 = 1, then v2 = 1. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 4 is:\n\nv1 = [1, 1]\n\n2) For λ2 = 7:\n\n(A - 7I)v2 = 0\n[[-2, -1], [2, -1]]v2 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we get the equation:\n\n-2v1 - v2 = 0 => v2 = -2v1\n\nLet v1 = 1, then v2 = -2. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 7 is:\n\nv2 = [1, -2]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 4 with eigenvector v1 = [1, 1]\nEigenvalue λ2 = 7 with eigenvector v2 = [1, -2]"
