    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first need to form an augmented matrix:\n\n| 1   1   1 | 9\n| 2  4.1  3 | 20\n| 1 -0.5  1 | 7.5\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the x term in the second and third rows.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1:\n| 1   1    1 |  9\n| 0   2.1  1 |  2\n| 1 -0.5  1 | 7.5\n\nRow3 = Row3 - Row1:\n| 1   1    1 |  9\n| 0   2.1  1 |  2\n| 0  -1.5  0 | -1.5\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the y term in the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 - (-1.5/2.1) * Row2:\n| 1   1    1 |  9\n| 0   2.1  1 |  2\n| 0   0  -1 |  1\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\n-1z = 1 => z = -1\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\n2.1y + 1(-1) = 2 => 2.1y = 3 => y = 3/2.1 ≈ 1.43\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nx + 1.43 + (-1) = 9 => x = 9 - 1.43 + 1 => x ≈ 8.57\n\nSo, the approximate solution for the system of linear equations is x ≈ 8.57, y ≈ 1.43, and z = -1.\n\nHowever, since the coefficients are contaminated by additive noise with a maximum error of ±0.2, the true values of x, y, and z might be slightly different. This means that the solution we found is an approximation, and the actual values could be within the range of the maximum error."
