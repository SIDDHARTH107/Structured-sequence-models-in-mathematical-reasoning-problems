    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\ny = x^2 + 2x + 3 (Equation of curve X)\ny = 2x + 1 (Equation of line Y)\n\nWe can set the two equations equal to each other to find the x-values of the intersection points:\n\nx^2 + 2x + 3 = 2x + 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x by rearranging the equation:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 2x + 3 - 1 = 0\nx^2 + 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 2:\n\nx = (-0 ± √(0^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nx = (± √(-8)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. Therefore, there are no points of intersection between the curve X and the line Y."
