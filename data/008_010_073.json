Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix of the system.\n\n[ 3  2 -1 |  5 ]\n[ 1 -3  2 | -7 ]\n[ 2  1  4 | 10 ]\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - (1/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (2/3)R1\n\n[ 3   2  -1 |   5 ]\n[ 0  -5   7/3 | -22/3 ]\n[ 0  -1  10/3 |  20/3 ]\n\nNext, we will eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - (-1/5)R2\n\n[ 3   2  -1 |   5 ]\n[ 0  -5   7/3 | -22/3 ]\n[ 0   0   4 |   4 ]\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nNow that we have an upper triangular matrix, we can perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n4z = 4\nz = 1\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-5y + (7/3)z = -22/3\n-5y + (7/3)(1) = -22/3\ny = 2\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 5\n3x + 2(2) - 1 = 5\nx = 1\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
