    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point P(-2, 9), we need to find the derivative of the given function y = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 1 with respect to x, and then evaluate it at the x-coordinate of point P, which is -2.\n\nThe derivative of the function y with respect to x is:\n\ny' = d(2x^3 - 3x^2 + 1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ny' = 6x^2 - 6x\n\nNow, we need to evaluate y' at x = -2:\n\ny'(-2) = 6(-2)^2 - 6(-2)\n\ny'(-2) = 6(4) + 12\n\ny'(-2) = 24 + 12\n\ny'(-2) = 36\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point P(-2, 9) is 36."
