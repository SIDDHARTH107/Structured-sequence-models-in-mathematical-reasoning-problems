    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given a sum of $100 and proposes a division of the money to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If Player 2 rejects, neither player gets any money. What is the highest amount that Player 1 can propose to keep for themselves and still expect Player 2 to accept, assuming Player 2 values money equally?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the rational decision for Player 2 is to accept any amount greater than $0, as getting some money is better than getting nothing. However, human behavior often deviates from this purely rational approach due to factors like fairness and social norms.\n\nAssuming Player 2 values money equally and acts rationally, the highest amount Player 1 can propose to keep for themselves is $99, offering $1 to Player 2. This is because Player 2 would still prefer to accept the $1 rather than rejecting the offer and getting nothing. However, in real-world situations, such an unfair split may not be accepted by Player 2 due to the reasons mentioned earlier."
