    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a numerical problem based on Deontic logic, as it deals with modalities of obligation, permission, and prohibition, rather than numerical calculations. Deontic logic examines how the truth of statements changes when we add modality operators like \"ought to\" or \"must\", but it doesn't involve numerical computations. Would you like me to suggest a question related to a different subtopic from mathematics?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Here's a question related to algebra:\n\nSolve the following linear equation for x:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x + 5"
