    "message_2": "The given equation is in the form of $y = A\\sin(Bx - C) + D$, where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, we have $A = 2$, $B = 3$, $C = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, and $D = 1$. We are asked to find the phase shift, which is represented by C.\n\nThe phase shift is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. However, to determine the direction of the phase shift, we need to look at the sign in front of the phase shift in the equation. Since it is a negative sign, the phase shift is to the right.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the sound wave is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ to the right."
