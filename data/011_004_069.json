    "message_1": "A company has 5 employees who can be assigned to 3 different projects. If each project needs to have at least 1 employee assigned to it, how many possible combinations of employee assignments are there?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of ways to assign the 5 employees to the 3 projects without any restrictions. Each employee can be assigned to any of the 3 projects, so there are 3^5 = 243 possible assignments.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of ways in which at least one project has no employees assigned to it. There are 3 ways to choose which project has no employees, and then 2^5 = 32 ways to assign the employees to the remaining 2 projects. So, there are 3 * 32 = 96 assignments in which at least one project has no employees.\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the cases where two projects have no employees assigned to them. There is only 1 way to assign all 5 employees to a single project, and there are 3 ways to choose which project gets all the employees. So, there are 3 * 1 = 3 assignments in which two projects have no employees.\n\nUsing the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we find the total number of valid assignments as follows:\n\nTotal assignments = (Total without restrictions) - (At least one project has no employees) + (Two projects have no employees)\nTotal assignments = 243 - 96 + 3 = 150\n\nSo, there are 150 possible combinations of employee assignments where each project has at least 1 employee assigned to it."
