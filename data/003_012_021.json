    "message_1": "A student is standing 200 meters away from the foot of a building. The angle of elevation from the student's eye to the top of the building is 30 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this problem, we have the angle of elevation (30 degrees) and the distance from the student to the building (200 meters). We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(angle) = height / distance\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\ntan(30) = height / 200\n\nThe tangent of 30 degrees is equal to 1/sqrt(3) or sqrt(3)/3. So,\n\nsqrt(3)/3 = height / 200\n\nTo find the height, multiply both sides by 200:\n\nheight = 200 * sqrt(3)/3\n\nheight â‰ˆ 115.47 meters\n\nThe height of the building is approximately 115.47 meters."
