If $z(0) = 1$ and $z'(0) = i$, find $z(t)$.\n\nHint: The characteristic equation of the differential equation is $\\lambda^2 + 4 = 0$, which has roots $\\lambda_1 = -2i$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2i$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we will use the general solution for a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution is given by:\n\n$z(t) = c_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + c_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are the roots of the characteristic equation, and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants to be determined using the initial conditions.\n\nAs given, the roots of the characteristic equation are $\\lambda_1 = -2i$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2i$. So, the general solution becomes:\n\n$z(t) = c_1 e^{-2it} + c_2 e^{2it}$\n\nNow, we will use the initial conditions to find the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$.\n\n1) $z(0) = 1$: \n\n$1 = c_1 e^{0} + c_2 e^{0} \\Rightarrow 1 = c_1 + c_2$\n\n2) $z'(0) = i$: \n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of $z(t)$:\n\n$z'(t) = -2ic_1 e^{-2it} + 2ic_2 e^{2it}$\n\nNow, we will use the initial condition $z'(0) = i$:\n\n$i = -2ic_1 e^{0} + 2ic_2 e^{0} \\Rightarrow i = -2ic_1 + 2ic_2$\n\nDivide both sides by $2i$:\n\n$1 = -c_1 + c_2$\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\n$c_1 + c_2 = 1$\n\n$-c_1 + c_2 = 1$\n\nSolving this system, we get $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 1$. Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\n$z(t) = e^{2it}$"
