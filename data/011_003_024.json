    "message_2": "To find the sum of the numbers in the seventh row of Pascal's triangle, we can use the formula for the sum of the elements in a row, which is 2^n, where n is the row number (starting from row 0).\n\nThe seventh row is row 6 (since we start counting from row 0), so the sum of the numbers in the seventh row is:\n\n2^6 = 64\n\nThe sum of the numbers in the seventh row of Pascal's triangle is 64."
