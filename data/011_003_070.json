    "message_2": "The sixth row of Pascal's triangle is obtained by adding the adjacent numbers in the fifth row. The fifth row is 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. The sixth row is generated as follows:\n\n1 (from the left edge)\n1+4 = 5\n4+6 = 10\n6+4 = 10\n4+1 = 5\n1 (from the right edge)\n\nSo, the sixth row is 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1. There are 4 odd numbers in this row: 1, 5, 5, and 1."
