    "message_1": "Suppose you have a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. The cipher uses 16 rounds and each round involves a round function that uses a substitution box (S-box) with 8-bit input and output. If the plaintext is \"1010101010101010\" in binary representation and the key is \"1110000111100001111000011110000111100001111000011110000111100001\", what is the resulting ciphertext after encryption?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the Feistel cipher encryption process for 16 rounds using the given plaintext and key. However, since the round function is not provided, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext.\n\nThe Feistel cipher encryption process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext into two equal halves, L0 and R0.\n2. For each round i (from 1 to 16), compute the new values Li and Ri as follows:\n   - Li = Ri-1\n   - Ri = Li-1 XOR F(Ri-1, Ki), where F is the round function and Ki is the round key derived from the main key.\n3. After the last round, concatenate R16 and L16 to form the ciphertext.\n\nIn this case, the plaintext is \"1010101010101010\", so L0 = \"1010\" and R0 = \"1010\". The key is \"1110000111100001111000011110000111100001111000011110000111100001\".\n\nWithout the round function F and the process of deriving round keys Ki, we cannot proceed with the encryption process and compute the ciphertext."
