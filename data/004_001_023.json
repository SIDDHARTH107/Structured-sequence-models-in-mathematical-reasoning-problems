    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2, we need to differentiate it with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2 - 4x + 2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at the point x = 1:\n\nf'(1) = 6(1) - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2 at the point x = 1 is 2."
