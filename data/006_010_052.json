    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, people testing positive for the disease) in n trials (in this case, 500 people)\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as nCx or \"n choose x\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6 or 60%)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 500 people)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, 80% of 500 people, which is 400 people)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(400) = C(500, 400) * 0.6^400 * 0.4^100\n\nTo calculate C(500, 400), we can use the formula:\n\nC(n, x) = n! / (x!(n-x)!)\n\nwhere \"n!\" denotes the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n).\n\nC(500, 400) = 500! / (400! * 100!)\n\nCalculating factorials for large numbers can be challenging, so we can use approximation methods or calculators to find the value. Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nC(500, 400) ≈ 2.456 × 10^125\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(400) ≈ (2.456 × 10^125) * 0.6^400 * 0.4^100\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the final probability, we get:\n\nP(400) ≈ 1.08 × 10^-19\n\nSo, the probability that out of a randomly selected group of 500 people, 80% of them will test positive for a disease that is known to affect 60% of the population is approximately 1.08 × 10^-19."
