    "message_2": "To find the largest possible side length for the squares, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the dimensions of the metal sheet (20 inches and 30 inches).\n\nThe factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.\nThe factors of 30 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 20 and 30 is 10. Therefore, the largest possible side length for the squares is 10 inches."
