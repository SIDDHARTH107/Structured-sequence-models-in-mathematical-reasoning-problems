The distances between the locations are given in the table below:\n\n| Locations | Distance from Location |\n|---------|:----------------:|\n| A|        10|\n| B|        15|\n| C|        20|\n| D|        25|\n| E|        30|\n\nIf the delivery person starts at location A and wants to minimize the total distance traveled, what is the optimal order of deliveries for the person to make?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total distance traveled, the delivery person should visit the locations in the order of their distances from the starting point. In this case, the order would be:\n\nA → B → C → D → E\n\nThis way, the delivery person will travel the shortest possible distance between each location. The total distance traveled will be:\n\n10 (A to B) + 15 (B to C) + 20 (C to D) + 25 (D to E) = 70 units."
