    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\n1. Find the first derivative of the function:\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 6:\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 1 and x = 2. These are the critical points of the function.\n\n3. To determine if these critical points are maximum or minimum, we can use the second derivative test. Find the second derivative of the function:\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5) = 12x - 18\n\n4. Evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\nf''(1) = 12(1) - 18 = -6\nf''(2) = 12(2) - 18 = 6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, there is a local maximum at x = 1. Since f''(2) > 0, there is a local minimum at x = 2.\n\n5. To find the maximum value of the function, evaluate the function at the local maximum point:\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 12(1) + 5 = 2 - 9 + 12 + 5 = 10\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5 using Newton's method is 10."
