    "message_1": "A cube has a volume of 27 cubic units. What is the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube? (Assume that the sphere is touching all six faces of the cube and use $\\pi$ as 3.14)",
    "message_2": "Since the cube has a volume of 27 cubic units, we can find the side length of the cube by taking the cube root of the volume:\n\nSide length of cube = ∛27 = 3 units\n\nNow, we know that the diameter of the inscribed sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, so the diameter of the sphere is 3 units. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half of the diameter:\n\nRadius of sphere = Diameter / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5 units\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume of sphere = (4/3)πr³\n\nUsing the given value for π (3.14) and the radius (1.5 units), we can calculate the volume:\n\nVolume of sphere = (4/3) * 3.14 * (1.5)³\nVolume of sphere = (4/3) * 3.14 * 3.375\nVolume of sphere ≈ 14.13 cubic units\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 14.13 cubic units."
