    "message_2": "We have $f(x,y,z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz$. Let's plug in $\\omega^a, \\omega^b, \\omega^c$ for $x, y, z$, respectively:\n\n$f(\\omega^a, \\omega^b, \\omega^c) = (\\omega^a)^3 + (\\omega^b)^3 + (\\omega^c)^3 - 3(\\omega^a)(\\omega^b)(\\omega^c)$.\n\nRecall that $\\omega^3 = 1$. Thus, we have:\n\n$f(\\omega^a, \\omega^b, \\omega^c) = \\omega^{3a} + \\omega^{3b} + \\omega^{3c} - 3\\omega^{a+b+c}$.\n\nSince $\\omega^3 = 1$, we can simplify this expression to:\n\n$f(\\omega^a, \\omega^b, \\omega^c) = 1 + 1 + 1 - 3\\omega^{a+b+c} = 3 - 3\\omega^{a+b+c}$.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of distinct ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of non-negative integers such that $f(\\omega^a,\\omega^b,\\omega^c)=0$. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer triples $(a,b,c)$ such that:\n\n$3 - 3\\omega^{a+b+c} = 0 \\implies \\omega^{a+b+c} = 1$.\n\nSince $\\omega^3 = 1$, we have that $a+b+c$ must be a multiple of 3. Let $k = \\frac{a+b+c}{3}$. Then, we have:\n\n$a+b+c = 3k$ for some non-negative integer $k$.\n\nNow, we can use stars and bars to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation. We have 3 \"bins\" (corresponding to $a, b, c$) and $3k$ \"stars\" (corresponding to the sum). Using stars and bars, the number of non-negative integer solutions is:\n\n$\\binom{3k+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{3k+2}{2}$.\n\nSince $k$ can be any non-negative integer, the total number of distinct ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ is the sum of these binomial coefficients over all non-negative integers $k$:\n\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{3k+2}{2}$.\n\nHowever, this sum is infinite, so we need to find a way to bound it. Notice that if $k \\geq 3$, then $a+b+c \\geq 9$, which implies that at least one of $a, b, c$ must be greater than or equal to 3. But if one of them is greater than or equal to 3, then $\\omega^{a+b+c}$ cannot be equal to 1, since $\\omega^3 = 1$ and $\\omega^6 = 1$, but $\\omega^9 \\neq 1$. Therefore, we only need to consider the cases $k = 0, 1, 2$.\n\nFor $k=0$, we have $a+b+c=0$, which has only one solution: $(a,b,c)=(0,0,0)$.\n\nFor $k=1$, we have $a+b+c=3$, which has 3 solutions: $(a,b,c)=(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3)$.\n\nFor $k=2$, we have $a+b+c=6$, which has 6 solutions: $(a,b,c)=(6,0,0), (0,6,0), (0,0,6), (3,3,0), (3,0,3), (0,3,3)$.\n\nThus, there are a total of $1+3+6=\\boxed{10}$ distinct ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of non-negative integers such that $f(\\omega^a,\\omega^b,\\omega^c)=0$."
