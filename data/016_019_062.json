    "message_2": "The Koch Island fractal is formed by applying the Koch curve transformation to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the perimeter of the fractal increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nLet P(n) be the perimeter of the Koch Island fractal after n iterations. Given that the initial perimeter of the triangle is 3, we have P(0) = 3.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by 4/3, so P(1) = P(0) * (4/3) = 3 * (4/3) = 4.\n\nAfter the second iteration, the perimeter is again multiplied by 4/3, so P(2) = P(1) * (4/3) = 4 * (4/3) = 16/3.\n\nAfter the third iteration, the perimeter is once more multiplied by 4/3, so P(3) = P(2) * (4/3) = (16/3) * (4/3) = 64/9.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the Koch Island fractal after three iterations is 64/9."
