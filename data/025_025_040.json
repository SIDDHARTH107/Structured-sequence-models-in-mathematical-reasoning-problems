    "message_2": "To solve the matrix equation X^2 + 3X + 2I = 0, where X is a 2x2 matrix with entries in the field F_3 and I is the 2x2 identity matrix, we first need to simplify the equation. Since we are working in the field F_3, we can reduce the coefficients modulo 3. The equation becomes:\n\nX^2 + 0X + 2I = 0, or X^2 + 2I = 0.\n\nNow, let X be a 2x2 matrix with entries a, b, c, and d:\n\nX = | a  b |\n    | c  d |\n\nThen, X^2 is:\n\nX^2 = | a  b |^2 = | a^2 + bc  ab + bd |\n      | c  d |       | ac + cd  bc + d^2 |\n\nSo, the equation X^2 + 2I = 0 becomes:\n\n| a^2 + bc  ab + bd |   | 2  0 |   | 0  0 |\n| ac + cd  bc + d^2 | + | 0  2 | = | 0  0 |\n\nThis leads to the following system of equations:\n\n1. a^2 + bc + 2 = 0\n2. ab + bd = 0\n3. ac + cd = 0\n4. bc + d^2 + 2 = 0\n\nSince we are working in the field F_3, the possible values for a, b, c, and d are 0, 1, and 2. We can now solve the system of equations by trying all possible combinations of values for a, b, c, and d:\n\nAfter trying all possible combinations, we find the following solutions:\n\nX1 = | 0  1 |, X2 = | 0  2 |, X3 = | 1  0 |, X4 = | 1  1 |,\n     | 2  2 |       | 1  1 |       | 2  2 |       | 0  1 |\n\nX5 = | 1  2 |, X6 = | 2  0 |, X7 = | 2  1 |, X8 = | 2  2 |.\n     | 0  1 |       | 1  1 |       | 1  0 |       | 0  2 |\n\nSo, there are 8 possible solutions for the matrix equation X^2 + 3X + 2I = 0 in the field F_3."
