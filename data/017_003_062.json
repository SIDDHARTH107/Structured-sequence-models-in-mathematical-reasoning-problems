    "message_2": "A generator of a group of prime order p (in this case, p=17) is an element g in the group such that when you raise it to the powers 1, 2, ..., p-1, you get all the non-identity elements of the group. In other words, the order of g is p.\n\nFor a group of prime order 17, we can consider the multiplicative group of integers modulo 17, denoted as (Z/17Z)*. This group has 16 elements: {1, 2, 3, ..., 16}. To find a generator, we need to find an element g such that g^k (mod 17) generates all the non-identity elements of the group for k = 1, 2, ..., 16.\n\nLet's test some elements:\n\n- g = 2: 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 15, 2^6 = 13, 2^7 = 9, 2^8 = 1, and so on. We can see that 2 generates all the non-identity elements of the group.\n\nSo, a generator of the group of prime order 17 is 2. Note that there may be other generators as well, but 2 is one of them."
