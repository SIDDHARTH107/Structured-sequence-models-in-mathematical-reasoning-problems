    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation using the method of integrating factors, we first identify the integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y, which in this case is 3:\n\nIntegrating factor = $e^{\\int 3 dx} = e^{3x}$\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\n$e^{3x} \\frac{dy}{dx} + 3e^{3x} y = xe^{3x}$\n\nThe left side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{3x}) = xe^{3x}$\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n$\\int \\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{3x}) dx = \\int xe^{3x} dx$\n\n$ye^{3x} = \\int xe^{3x} dx + C$\n\nTo find the integral of $xe^{3x}$, we can use integration by parts. Let $u = x$ and $dv = e^{3x} dx$. Then, $du = dx$ and $v = \\frac{1}{3}e^{3x}$. Applying integration by parts:\n\n$\\int xe^{3x} dx = \\frac{1}{3}xe^{3x} - \\frac{1}{3}\\int e^{3x} dx$\n\n$\\int xe^{3x} dx = \\frac{1}{3}xe^{3x} - \\frac{1}{9}e^{3x} + C$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\n\n$ye^{3x} = \\frac{1}{3}xe^{3x} - \\frac{1}{9}e^{3x} + C$\n\nWe are given the initial condition $y(0) = 2$. We can use this to find the constant C:\n\n$2 = \\frac{1}{3}(0) - \\frac{1}{9} + C$\n\n$C = \\frac{1}{9} + 2 = \\frac{19}{9}$\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\n$ye^{3x} = \\frac{1}{3}xe^{3x} - \\frac{1}{9}e^{3x} + \\frac{19}{9}$\n\nTo find y, we divide both sides by $e^{3x}$:\n\n$y = \\frac{1}{3}x - \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{19}{9e^{3x}}$\n\nFinally, we can find the solution of this system at $x = 1$:\n\n$y(1) = \\frac{1}{3}(1) - \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{19}{9e^{3}}$\n\n$y(1) = \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{19}{9e^{3}}$\n\nThis is the solution of the given differential equation at $x = 1$."
