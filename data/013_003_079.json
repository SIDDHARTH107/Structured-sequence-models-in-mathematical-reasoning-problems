    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given $10 and offers a share to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, they split the money as agreed. If Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player receives any money. Assuming rational decision making, what is the minimum amount that Player 1 should offer to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "Assuming rational decision making, the minimum amount that Player 1 should offer to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer is $0.01. This is because any positive amount is better than receiving nothing, and a rational Player 2 would accept any offer greater than $0 to maximize their payoff. However, in real-life situations, people may not always act rationally and may reject offers they perceive as unfair."
