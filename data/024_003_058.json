    "message_2": "To calculate the Gaussian curvature of the surface S at the point (0,0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nwhere -1 ≤ u ≤ 1 and -1 ≤ v ≤ 1.\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\nM = r_uv • N = (0, 0, 0) • (0, 0, 1) = 0\nN = r_vv • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface S, which can be found as the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, 2v) = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (0,0), we have:\n\nE(0,0) = 1\nF(0,0) = 0\nG(0,0) = 1\nL(0,0) = 2\nM(0,0) = 0\nN(0,0) = 2\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature K at the point (0,0) is:\n\nK = (2 * 2 - 0^2) / (1 * 1 - 0^2) = 4 / 1 = 4\n\nTherefore, the Gaussian curvature of the surface S at the point (0,0) is 4."
