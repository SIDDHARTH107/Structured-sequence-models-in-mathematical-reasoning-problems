    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(L)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and L is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each segment is divided into 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), and each piece is 1/3 the size of the original segment (L = 3). So, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with the number of iterations, so the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after five recursive iterations is still approximately 1.2619, regardless of the initial segment length."
