    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 12: 2^2 * 3^1\nPrime factorization of 15: 3^1 * 5^1\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations:\n\n2^2, 3^1, and 5^1\n\nMultiply these prime factors together:\n\n2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60\n\nSo, the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15 is 60."
