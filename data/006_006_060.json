    "message_1": "In a football match, the probability of Team A winning is 0.6 and the probability of Team B winning is 0.4. If you were to bet on Team A winning, what are the odds in favor of winning in fractional form?",
    "message_2": "To find the odds in favor of Team A winning, we can use the formula:\n\nOdds in favor = Probability of winning / Probability of losing\n\nIn this case, the probability of Team A winning is 0.6, and the probability of Team A losing (which is the same as Team B winning) is 0.4.\n\nOdds in favor of Team A = 0.6 / 0.4 = 3/2\n\nSo, the odds in favor of Team A winning are 3:2 in fractional form."
