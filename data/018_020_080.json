    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the union of B and C, which is denoted as B ∪ C. The union of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nB ∪ C = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B ∪ C), which is denoted as A △ (B ∪ C).\n\nA △ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ (B ∪ C)) - (A ∩ (B ∪ C)) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3} = {1, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A △ B) and C, which is denoted as (A △ B) ∪ C.\n\n(A △ B) ∪ C = {1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) ∪ C and A △ (B ∪ C).\n\n((A △ B) ∪ C) △ (A △ (B ∪ C)) = ({1, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {1, 4, 5}) - ({1, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 4, 5}) = {1, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 4, 5} = {3}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of (A △ B) ∪ C and A △ (B ∪ C) is {3}.\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union. Let X, Y, and Z be arbitrary sets. We want to show that:\n\n(X △ Y) ∪ Z = (X ∪ Z) △ (Y ∪ Z)\n\nLet's break down both sides of the equation:\n\n(X △ Y) ∪ Z = ((X - Y) ∪ (Y - X)) ∪ Z\n\n(X ∪ Z) △ (Y ∪ Z) = ((X ∪ Z) - (Y ∪ Z)) ∪ ((Y ∪ Z) - (X ∪ Z))\n\nNow, let's use the distributive property of set difference over union:\n\n(X △ Y) ∪ Z = (X - Y ∪ X - Z) ∪ (Y - X ∪ Y - Z)\n\n(X ∪ Z) △ (Y ∪ Z) = (X - Y ∪ X - Z) ∪ (Y - X ∪ Y - Z)\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we have shown that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union."
