    "message_1": "Sorry, I cannot provide a numerical problem for the subtopic Paraconsistent logic as it is a non-classical logic that doesn't follow the law of non-contradiction which means that there can be contradictions that are true at the same time. It is used to reason on inconsistent information or knowledge. It is not based on numerical problems or calculations but rather deals with logical propositions and their truth values.",
    "message_2": "That's perfectly fine. If you have any other mathematical problems or questions, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help."
