    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series of the function f(z) = 1/(z^2 - 3z + 2) centered at z = 0, we first factor the denominator:\n\nf(z) = 1/((z - 1)(z - 2))\n\nNow we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n1/((z - 1)(z - 2)) = A/(z - 1) + B/(z - 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z - 1)(z - 2) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n1 = A(z - 2) + B(z - 1)\n\nTo solve for A and B, we can use the following system of equations:\n\n1. Let z = 1: 1 = -A\n2. Let z = 2: 1 = B\n\nSo, A = -1 and B = 1. Now we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = -1/(z - 1) + 1/(z - 2)\n\nNow we can find the Laurent series for each term separately. Since we are working in the annulus 1 < |z - 1| < 2, we can rewrite the terms as:\n\n-1/(z - 1) = -1/(1 - (1 - z)) = -Σ(1 - z)^n (for n = 0 to ∞)\n1/(z - 2) = 1/(2 - (z - 1)) = 1/2 Σ((z - 1)/2)^n (for n = 0 to ∞)\n\nNow we can combine the two series to get the Laurent series for f(z):\n\nf(z) = -Σ(1 - z)^n + 1/2 Σ((z - 1)/2)^n (for n = 0 to ∞)\n\nThe convergence of this series is given by the annulus 1 < |z - 1| < 2, as specified in the problem."
