    "message_1": "A curve is defined by the equation y = x^2/5 from x=0 to x=5. Find the length of the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x^2/5:\n\nf'(x) = d(x^2/5)/dx = (2x)/5\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 5] √(1 + ((2x)/5)^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 5] √(1 + (4x^2)/25) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's use the substitution:\n\nu = x/5 => x = 5u => dx = 5 du\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nL = ∫[0, 1] 5√(1 + (4(5u)^2)/25) du\n\nL = ∫[0, 1] 5√(1 + 4u^2) du\n\nNow, we can use another substitution:\n\nv = 2u => u = v/2 => du = dv/2\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nL = ∫[0, 2] (5/2)√(1 + (v^2)) dv\n\nNow, we can recognize this as the integral form of the hyperbolic sine function:\n\nL = (5/2) * sinh^(-1)(v) | [0, 2]\n\nL = (5/2) * (sinh^(-1)(2) - sinh^(-1)(0))\n\nL = (5/2) * sinh^(-1)(2)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of sinh^(-1)(2):\n\nL ≈ (5/2) * 1.443635\n\nL ≈ 7.218175\n\nSo, the length of the curve is approximately 7.218 units."
