    "message_1": "Based on non-monotonic logic, here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you have 10 cards, each with a number written on one side. The numbers on these cards are 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, and 6. Now, you are given two rules for these cards:\n\n1. If a card has an even number on one side, then it must have an odd number on the other side.\n2. If the two cards you pick have the same number on one side, then they must not have the same number on the other side.\n\nWith these two rules, can you determine which cards have even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other side? If so, which cards are they?",
    "message_2": "Yes, we can determine which cards have even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other side.\n\nLet's analyze the two rules:\n\n1. If a card has an even number on one side, then it must have an odd number on the other side.\n   This means that the cards with even numbers (2, 4, and 6) must have odd numbers on the other side.\n\n2. If the two cards you pick have the same number on one side, then they must not have the same number on the other side.\n   This means that if we pick two cards with the same even number, they must have different odd numbers on the other side.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the cards:\n\n- For the cards with the number 2, one card must have an odd number different from the other card with the number 2. Let's say one card has 3 and the other has 5 on the other side. So, we have cards (2,3) and (2,5).\n\n- For the cards with the number 4, one card must have an odd number different from the other card with the number 4. Since 3 and 5 are already used for the cards with the number 2, we can use 1 and 7 for the cards with the number 4. So, we have cards (4,1) and (4,7).\n\n- For the cards with the number 6, one card must have an odd number different from the other card with the number 6. We can use 9 and 11 for the cards with the number 6. So, we have cards (6,9) and (6,11).\n\nSo, the cards with even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other side are (2,3), (2,5), (4,1), (4,7), (6,9), and (6,11)."
