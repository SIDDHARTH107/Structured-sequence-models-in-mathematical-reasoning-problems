    "message_2": "To calculate the phase shift $\\phi$ using Fourier analysis, we first need to represent the input and output signals in their complex exponential form. This will allow us to easily compare their phase shifts.\n\nThe input signal $x(t) = 2\\cos(3t) - 4\\sin(6t)$ can be represented as a sum of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\n$$x(t) = A_1e^{j\\omega_1 t} + A_2e^{j\\omega_2 t}$$\n\nwhere $A_1 = 1 + j0$, $\\omega_1 = 3$, $A_2 = 0 - 4j$, and $\\omega_2 = 6$. So, we have:\n\n$$x(t) = (1 + j0)e^{j3t} + (0 - 4j)e^{j6t}$$\n\nNow, let's represent the output signal $y(t) = 3\\cos(3t + \\phi)$ in its complex exponential form:\n\n$$y(t) = Be^{j(\\omega_1 t + \\phi)}$$\n\nwhere $B = 3$ and $\\omega_1 = 3$. So, we have:\n\n$$y(t) = 3e^{j(3t + \\phi)}$$\n\nNow, we can use Fourier analysis to find the phase shift $\\phi$. Since the input and output signals have the same frequency component $\\omega_1 = 3$, we can compare their complex amplitudes at this frequency.\n\nFor the input signal, the complex amplitude at $\\omega_1 = 3$ is $A_1 = 1 + j0$. For the output signal, the complex amplitude at $\\omega_1 = 3$ is $B = 3e^{j\\phi}$.\n\nTo find the phase shift $\\phi$, we can divide the output complex amplitude by the input complex amplitude:\n\n$$\\frac{B}{A_1} = \\frac{3e^{j\\phi}}{1 + j0} = 3e^{j\\phi}$$\n\nSince the magnitudes of the input and output signals are related by $|B| = 3|A_1|$, we have:\n\n$$3 = 3e^{j\\phi}$$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n$$\\ln(3) = j\\phi$$\n\nFinally, we can find the phase shift $\\phi$:\n\n$$\\phi = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{j} = -j\\ln(3)$$\n\nSince the phase shift is purely imaginary, it means that the input and output signals are in quadrature (i.e., they have a phase difference of $\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$). In this case, the phase shift is negative, so the output signal is leading the input signal by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift $\\phi$ between the input and output signals is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$."
