    "message_2": "To find the value of $x$, we need to take the sine of both sides of the equation:\n\n$\\sin(\\sin^{-1}(x)) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6})$\n\nSince the sine and inverse sine functions are inverses of each other, they cancel each other out on the left side of the equation:\n\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6})$\n\nNow, we need to find the sine of $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$. Recall that $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ is equivalent to 30 degrees. The sine of 30 degrees is a well-known value:\n\n$x = \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$."
