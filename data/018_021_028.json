    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference of A and B using the given formula, we first need to choose a set C. Since the formula holds for any set C, let's choose C = A ∪ B, which is the union of A and B.\n\nC = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C)\n\nFirst, let's find the intersections A ∩ C and B ∩ C:\n\nA ∩ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ∩ C = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference of these two sets:\n\n(A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of A and B using the given formula is {1, 2, 6, 7}."
