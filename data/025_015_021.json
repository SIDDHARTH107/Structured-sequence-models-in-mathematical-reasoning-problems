    "message_2": "To find the coefficients of the quadratic equation whose roots are the points of intersection of the given curves, we first need to find the points of intersection. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\n$x^2 + 2x - 3 = 3x - 5$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:\n\n$x^2 + 2x - 3 - 3x + 5 = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$x^2 - x + 2 = 0$\n\nSo, the coefficients of the quadratic equation are:\n\n$a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 2$."
