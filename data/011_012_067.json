    "message_1": "A kindergarten school is organizing a field trip to a local zoo. There are 25 children in the class and the school needs to hire two buses to transport all the children. However, there are only 10 seats available on each bus. If the school wants to divide the children into equal groups to ride on the two buses, how many possible groups can they create using the Inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Inclusion-Exclusion principle, we first need to find the number of ways to divide the children into two groups without considering the constraint of the bus seat limit.\n\nThere are 25 children, so we want to divide them into two groups of 12 and 13 children. Using combinations, we can calculate the number of ways to do this:\n\nC(25, 12) = 25! / (12! * (25-12)!) = 25! / (12! * 13!) = 5,200,300 ways\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where there are more than 10 children in each group, which violates the bus seat limit. We can do this by finding the number of ways to divide the children into two groups of 11 and 14:\n\nC(25, 11) = 25! / (11! * (25-11)!) = 25! / (11! * 14!) = 3,268,760 ways\n\nHowever, we have now subtracted the cases where both buses are overfilled twice, so we need to add back the cases where there are 10 and 15 children in each group:\n\nC(25, 10) = 25! / (10! * (25-10)!) = 25! / (10! * 15!) = 3,268,760 ways\n\nUsing the Inclusion-Exclusion principle, the total number of possible groups that satisfy the bus seat constraint is:\n\n5,200,300 (initial groups) - 3,268,760 (11 and 14 children groups) + 3,268,760 (10 and 15 children groups) = 5,200,300 ways\n\nSo, there are 5,200,300 possible groups that can be created while satisfying the bus seat constraint."
