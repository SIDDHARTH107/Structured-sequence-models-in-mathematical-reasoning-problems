If we use a substitution cipher to encrypt the word \"MATH\", such that \"M\" maps to \"Q\", \"A\" maps to \"L\", \"T\" maps to \"W\", and \"H\" maps to \"F\", what would be the ciphertext for the plaintext word \"MATHEMATICS\"?",
    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext for the plaintext word \"MATHEMATICS\", we need to map each letter using the given substitution cipher. We have the following mappings:\n\nM -> Q\nA -> L\nT -> W\nH -> F\n\nNow, we need to find the mappings for the remaining letters in \"MATHEMATICS\", which are \"E\", \"I\", \"C\", and \"S\". Since we don't have any information about these mappings, we can't find the exact ciphertext for the given plaintext."
