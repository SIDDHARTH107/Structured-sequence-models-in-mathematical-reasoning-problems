    "message_2": "1. (A × B)'\nTo find the complement of the Cartesian product A × B, we first need to find A × B. \nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's consider the universal set U for both A and B. Since A and B have elements {1, 2} and {3, 4}, we can assume that U = {1, 2, 3, 4} for both sets. Then, the Cartesian product of U with itself is:\nU × U = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A × B by removing the elements of A × B from U × U:\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)} - {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\n2. A' × B'\nFirst, we need to find the complements of A and B:\nA' = U - A = {3, 4}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of A' and B':\nA' × B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n3. (A' × B')'\nTo find the complement of A' × B', we remove the elements of A' × B' from U × U:\n(A' × B')' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)} - {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n(A' × B')' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\n4. A' × B' ∪ (A × B)'\nNow, we find the union of A' × B' and (A × B)':\nA' × B' ∪ (A × B)' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)} ∪ {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\nA' × B' ∪ (A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compare (A × B)' and (A' × B')':\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n(A' × B')' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nWe can see that (A × B)' ≠ (A' × B')', which means the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
