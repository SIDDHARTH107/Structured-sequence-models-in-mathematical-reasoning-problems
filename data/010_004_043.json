    "message_2": "To show that A ∩ B is compact, we will use the fact that a subset of a topological space is compact if and only if every open cover of the subset has a finite subcover.\n\nLet {U_i} be an open cover of A ∩ B. Since A and B are compact, {U_i} ∪ {X - A} is an open cover of A, and {U_i} ∪ {X - B} is an open cover of B. By the compactness of A and B, there exist finite subcovers {U_i1, ..., U_ik, X - A} for A and {U_j1, ..., U_jm, X - B} for B.\n\nNow, consider the finite collection {U_i1, ..., U_ik, U_j1, ..., U_jm}. This collection is a subcover of {U_i} for A ∩ B. To see this, let x ∈ A ∩ B. Then x ∈ A and x ∈ B. Since {U_i1, ..., U_ik, X - A} covers A, either x ∈ U_ir for some r, or x ∈ X - A. If x ∈ X - A, then x ∉ A, which is a contradiction. So x ∈ U_ir for some r. Similarly, x ∈ U_js for some s. Thus, x ∈ U_ir ∪ U_js, which implies that {U_i1, ..., U_ik, U_j1, ..., U_jm} covers A ∩ B.\n\nTherefore, A ∩ B has a finite subcover for every open cover {U_i}, which means A ∩ B is compact.\n\nNow, let's prove that if X is a Hausdorff topological space, then A and B being closed subsets of X with non-empty intersection implies that A ∩ B is also closed.\n\nRecall that a topological space X is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist disjoint open sets U, V ⊆ X such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nLet x ∈ X - (A ∩ B). We want to show that there exists an open set U containing x such that U ⊆ X - (A ∩ B).\n\nSince x ∉ A ∩ B, either x ∉ A or x ∉ B. Without loss of generality, assume x ∉ A. Since A is closed, X - A is open, and x ∈ X - A. Now, for any y ∈ A ∩ B, we have y ∈ A and y ∈ B. Since X is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets U_y and V_y such that x ∈ U_y and y ∈ V_y. Note that V_y ⊆ A, as A is closed and y ∈ A.\n\nNow, consider the open cover {V_y} of A ∩ B. Since A ∩ B is compact, there exists a finite subcover {V_y1, ..., V_yn} of A ∩ B. Let U = U_y1 ∩ ... ∩ U_yn. U is an open set containing x, as each U_yi is open and x ∈ U_yi for all i.\n\nWe claim that U ⊆ X - (A ∩ B). Suppose there exists a point z ∈ U such that z ∈ A ∩ B. Then z ∈ V_yi for some i. But U and V_yi are disjoint by construction, which is a contradiction. Therefore, U ⊆ X - (A ∩ B).\n\nSince for every x ∈ X - (A ∩ B), there exists an open set U containing x such that U ⊆ X - (A ∩ B), it follows that X - (A ∩ B) is open. Thus, A ∩ B is closed."
