    "message_1": "A population of rabbits grows in number at a rate proportional to its current population, but is also preyed upon by a population of foxes whose growth rate is proportional to the product of the current populations of rabbits and foxes. At time t = 0, there are 100 rabbits and 50 foxes. Find the population of each species at time t = 10 years, assuming that the growth rates are 0.1 and 0.05 per year, respectively.",
    "message_2": "Let R(t) be the population of rabbits at time t, and F(t) be the population of foxes at time t. We are given that the growth rate of rabbits is proportional to its current population, and the growth rate of foxes is proportional to the product of the current populations of rabbits and foxes. We can represent this as a system of differential equations:\n\ndR/dt = k1 * R(t)\ndF/dt = k2 * R(t) * F(t)\n\nwhere k1 = 0.1 and k2 = 0.05 are the growth rates of rabbits and foxes, respectively.\n\nWe are also given the initial conditions: R(0) = 100 and F(0) = 50.\n\nTo solve this system of differential equations, we can first solve the equation for rabbits:\n\ndR/dt = 0.1 * R(t)\n=> dR/R(t) = 0.1 * dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(R(t)) = 0.1 * t + C1\n=> R(t) = e^(0.1 * t + C1)\n=> R(t) = e^(0.1 * t) * e^C1\n\nUsing the initial condition R(0) = 100, we can find the value of e^C1:\n\n100 = e^(0.1 * 0) * e^C1\n=> e^C1 = 100\n\nSo, the equation for the rabbit population is:\n\nR(t) = 100 * e^(0.1 * t)\n\nNow, we can solve the equation for foxes:\n\ndF/dt = 0.05 * R(t) * F(t)\n=> dF/dt = 0.05 * (100 * e^(0.1 * t)) * F(t)\n=> dF/F(t) = 5 * e^(0.1 * t) * dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(F(t)) = 5 * ∫e^(0.1 * t) dt + C2\n=> ln(F(t)) = 50 * e^(0.1 * t) + C2\n=> F(t) = e^(50 * e^(0.1 * t) + C2)\n=> F(t) = e^(50 * e^(0.1 * t)) * e^C2\n\nUsing the initial condition F(0) = 50, we can find the value of e^C2:\n\n50 = e^(50 * e^(0.1 * 0)) * e^C2\n=> e^C2 = 1\n\nSo, the equation for the fox population is:\n\nF(t) = e^(50 * e^(0.1 * t))\n\nNow, we can find the populations of rabbits and foxes at time t = 10 years:\n\nR(10) = 100 * e^(0.1 * 10)\nR(10) = 100 * e^1 ≈ 100 * 2.718 ≈ 271.8\n\nF(10) = e^(50 * e^(0.1 * 10))\nF(10) = e^(50 * e^1) ≈ e^(50 * 2.718) ≈ 1.93 * 10^59\n\nAt time t = 10 years, there are approximately 271.8 rabbits and 1.93 * 10^59 foxes."
