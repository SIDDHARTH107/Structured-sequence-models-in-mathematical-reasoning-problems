    "message_2": "To choose 3 members out of 7, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of members (7 in this case), k is the number of members we want to choose (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\n\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 ways to choose 3 members out of 7 to form a subcommittee."
