    "message_1": "In an election, there are 5 candidates for the position of the President, 7 candidates for the position of the Vice President, and 9 candidates for the position of the Secretary. A student organization will vote for one candidate for each of the three positions. \n\nHow many different ways can the organization select one candidate for each of the three positions?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of ways the organization can select one candidate for each of the three positions, we can use the counting principle. We multiply the number of choices for each position together.\n\nFor the President position, there are 5 choices.\nFor the Vice President position, there are 7 choices.\nFor the Secretary position, there are 9 choices.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select one candidate for each position is:\n\n5 (choices for President) × 7 (choices for Vice President) × 9 (choices for Secretary) = 315 different ways."
