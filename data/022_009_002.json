    "message_2": "To find the interval of convergence for the given power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| < 1$$\n\nFor the given power series, the general term is:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{(x-1)^n}{n^2 + 1}$$\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of consecutive terms:\n\n$$\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{\\frac{(x-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^2 + 1}}{\\frac{(x-1)^n}{n^2 + 1}} = \\frac{(x-1)^{n+1}(n^2 + 1)}{(x-1)^n((n+1)^2 + 1)}$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{(x-1)(n^2 + 1)}{(n+1)^2 + 1}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the limit as n approaches infinity:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-1)(n^2 + 1)}{(n+1)^2 + 1}\\right|$$\n\nTo find this limit, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by the highest power of n, which is $n^2$:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-1)(1 + \\frac{1}{n^2})}{(1 + \\frac{1}{n})^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2}}\\right|$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the terms with n in the denominator approach 0:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-1)(1)}{(1)^2}\\right| = |x-1|$$\n\nFor the series to converge, this limit must be less than 1:\n\n$$|x-1| < 1$$\n\nSolving this inequality, we get the interval of convergence:\n\n$$-1 < x-1 < 1$$\n$$0 < x < 2$$\n\nSo, the interval of convergence for the given power series is $(0, 2)$."
