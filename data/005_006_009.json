    "message_1": "Suppose the average height of students in a school is 160 cm with a standard deviation of 8 cm. If a random sample of 25 students is taken from the school, what is the probability that the sample mean height is between 157 cm and 163 cm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. In this case, we have a sample size of 25 students.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error of the sample mean. The standard error (SE) is calculated as:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation (8 cm) and n is the sample size (25 students).\n\nSE = 8 / √25 = 8 / 5 = 1.6 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of sample mean heights (157 cm and 163 cm). The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nwhere x is the sample mean height, μ is the population mean height (160 cm), and SE is the standard error (1.6 cm).\n\nFor the lower bound (157 cm):\n\nz_lower = (157 - 160) / 1.6 = -3 / 1.6 ≈ -1.875\n\nFor the upper bound (163 cm):\n\nz_upper = (163 - 160) / 1.6 = 3 / 1.6 ≈ 1.875\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean height is between these z-scores. We can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nFor z = -1.875, the probability is 0.0307 (from the z-table).\nFor z = 1.875, the probability is 0.9693 (from the z-table).\n\nTo find the probability that the sample mean height is between 157 cm and 163 cm, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(157 cm < x < 163 cm) = P(z_upper) - P(z_lower) = 0.9693 - 0.0307 = 0.9386\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean height is between 157 cm and 163 cm is approximately 0.9386 or 93.86%."
