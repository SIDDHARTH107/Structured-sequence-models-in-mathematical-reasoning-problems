    "message_2": "To solve the homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 1  3 -2 | 0\n| 2 -1  4 | 0\n|-3  1 -2 | 0\n\nNext, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Add 2 times the first row to the second row to eliminate the x term in the second row:\n\n| 1  3 -2 | 0\n| 0 -7  8 | 0\n|-3  1 -2 | 0\n\n2. Add 3 times the first row to the third row to eliminate the x term in the third row:\n\n| 1  3 -2 | 0\n| 0 -7  8 | 0\n| 0 10 -8 | 0\n\nNow, we can perform back-substitution to find the solutions:\n\nFrom the second row, we have -7y + 8z = 0, which can be simplified to y = (8/7)z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have 10y - 8z = 0. Substituting the expression for y from the second row, we get:\n\n10(8/7)z - 8z = 0\n80z/7 - 8z = 0\n(80z - 56z)/7 = 0\n24z = 0\n\nSince this is a homogeneous system, z = 0.\n\nNow, substituting z = 0 back into the expression for y, we get:\n\ny = (8/7)(0) = 0\n\nFinally, substituting y = 0 and z = 0 back into the first equation, we get:\n\nx + 3(0) - 2(0) = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
