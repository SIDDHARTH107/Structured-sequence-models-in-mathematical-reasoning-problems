    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a time-delay differential equation given by:\n\n$$\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\beta \\frac{x(t-\\tau)}{1 + x(t-\\tau)^n} - \\gamma x(t)$$\n\nwhere $x(t)$ is the variable of interest, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are positive constants, $\\tau$ is the time delay, and $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo find the value of a period-3 orbit for the Mackey-Glass equation with the given parameters, we need to numerically solve the equation and analyze its behavior. However, the problem statement does not provide the value of $n$. Without the value of $n$, we cannot proceed to solve the equation and find the period-3 orbit value.\n\nPlease provide the value of $n$ to proceed with the solution."
