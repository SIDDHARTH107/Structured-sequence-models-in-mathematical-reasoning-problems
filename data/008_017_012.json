    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first represent the given system as a sparse matrix. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the matrix representation of the system is:\n\n```\n[ 2  4  0 |  8 ]\n[ 0 -3  6 | 12 ]\n[ 0  0  5 |  5 ]\n```\n\nNow, we can solve the system using back-substitution:\n\n1. Solve for z:\nFrom the third row, we have `5z = 5`. Dividing both sides by 5, we get `z = 1`.\n\n2. Solve for y:\nFrom the second row, we have `-3y + 6z = 12`. Substitute the value of z:\n`-3y + 6(1) = 12`\n`-3y + 6 = 12`\n`-3y = 6`\nDivide both sides by -3:\n`y = -2`\n\n3. Solve for x:\nFrom the first row, we have `2x + 4y + 0z = 8`. Substitute the values of y and z:\n`2x + 4(-2) + 0(1) = 8`\n`2x - 8 = 8`\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n`2x = 16`\nDivide both sides by 2:\n`x = 8`\n\nSo, the values of the variables are `x = 8`, `y = -2`, and `z = 1`."
