    "message_1": "A university wants to admit students on the basis of their scores in three different subjects: Math, Science, and English. The university has data of 100 students who have already been admitted and their scores in these three subjects. Using discriminant analysis, determine the minimum scores required in Math, Science, and English for a new student to be admitted to the university.",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we first need to have the data of the 100 students who have already been admitted and their scores in Math, Science, and English. However, since the data is not provided, I will outline the steps to perform discriminant analysis, and you can apply these steps to your data.\n\n1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the scores in each subject for the admitted students.\n\n2. Perform a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test if there are significant differences in the means of the three subjects.\n\n3. If the MANOVA test shows significant differences, perform a discriminant analysis to find the linear combination of the three subjects that best discriminates between the admitted and non-admitted students.\n\n4. Calculate the discriminant function coefficients for each subject. These coefficients will give you the weights for each subject in the linear combination.\n\n5. Calculate the discriminant scores for each student using the discriminant function coefficients and their scores in the three subjects.\n\n6. Determine the cutoff discriminant score for admission. You can do this by finding the lowest discriminant score among the admitted students or by setting a specific percentile (e.g., 90th percentile) as the cutoff.\n\n7. To find the minimum scores required in Math, Science, and English for a new student to be admitted, you can use the discriminant function coefficients and the cutoff discriminant score. Solve the linear equation for each subject, keeping the other two subjects' scores constant.\n\nPlease note that the actual minimum scores required in Math, Science, and English will depend on the data you have. Once you have the data, you can follow these steps to perform discriminant analysis and determine the minimum scores for admission."
