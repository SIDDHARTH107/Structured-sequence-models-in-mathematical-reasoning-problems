    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since A is a set of integers, let's assume that the universal set U is the set of all integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nBy comparing the elements of sets A and U, we can find the elements that are in U but not in A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement of set A is unique. To do this, let's assume that there is another complement of set A, denoted by B', such that B' ≠ A'. Since B' is also a complement of set A, it must satisfy the same condition as A':\n\nB' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nNow, let's compare the elements of sets A' and B'. Since both A' and B' are complements of set A, they must have the same elements that are not in set A. In other words, A' and B' must have the same elements, which are {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}. Therefore, A' = B', which contradicts our initial assumption that B' ≠ A'.\n\nHence, the complement of set A is unique, and it is the set A' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}."
