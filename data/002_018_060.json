    "message_2": "A cube with a volume of 64 cubic units has a side length of 4 units (since 4^3 = 64). The diameter of the inscribed sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, so the diameter of the sphere is 4 units. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is 2 units.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius. Plugging in the radius of 2 units, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(2^3)\nV = (4/3)π(8)\nV = 32π/3\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 33.51 cubic units."
