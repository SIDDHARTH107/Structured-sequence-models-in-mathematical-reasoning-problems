    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs and it's found that 3% of the bulbs are defective. If a sample of 100 bulbs is randomly selected, what is the probability that less than 5 bulbs are defective?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula. In this case, we have:\n\n- n = 100 (number of trials, or bulbs in the sample)\n- p = 0.03 (probability of success, or a bulb being defective)\n- q = 1 - p = 0.97 (probability of failure, or a bulb not being defective)\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * q^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of having k defective bulbs, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, and p^k and q^(n-k) are the probabilities of having k successes and n-k failures, respectively.\n\nWe want to find the probability of having less than 5 defective bulbs, which means we need to calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 defective bulbs and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nNow, we can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * (0.03)^0 * (0.97)^100\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (0.03)^1 * (0.97)^99\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * (0.03)^2 * (0.97)^98\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * (0.03)^3 * (0.97)^97\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * (0.03)^4 * (0.97)^96\n\nCalculating these probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.0476\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.2271\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.3419\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.2717\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.1149\n\nFinally, summing up these probabilities:\n\nP(X < 5) ≈ 0.0476 + 0.2271 + 0.3419 + 0.2717 + 0.1149 ≈ 1.0032\n\nHowever, since probabilities cannot be greater than 1, we can conclude that the probability of having less than 5 defective bulbs is approximately 1, or 100%. This means that it is almost certain that there will be less than 5 defective bulbs in the sample of 100."
