    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve remains the same after each iteration. To calculate the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, N = 4 (each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments) and s = 3 (each segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619.\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the 4th iteration is approximately 1.2619."
