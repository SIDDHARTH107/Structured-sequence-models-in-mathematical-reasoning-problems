    "message_1": "A math student is given the equation of a curve for a two-dimensional space: \n\ny^2 = x^3 + 3x^2 \n\nThe student is asked to use Mori theory to determine the number of rational curves that can be drawn through 9 general points on the above curve. How many rational curves pass through the 9 general points?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of rational curves that can be drawn through 9 general points on the curve y^2 = x^3 + 3x^2, we can use Mori theory, which is a part of algebraic geometry. In particular, we can use the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps.\n\nThe given curve is a plane cubic curve, which is a non-singular elliptic curve. For an elliptic curve, the genus g is equal to 1. According to Kontsevich's formula, the number of rational curves of degree d passing through 3d + g - 1 general points is given by:\n\nN_d = (3d - 1)! / (d!^3 * (3d + g - 4)!)\n\nIn our case, we have 9 general points, so we need to find the degree d such that:\n\n3d + 1 - 1 = 9\n3d = 9\nd = 3\n\nNow, we can plug this value into Kontsevich's formula:\n\nN_3 = (3 * 3 - 1)! / (3!^3 * (3 * 3 + 1 - 4)!)\nN_3 = 8! / (6! * 5!)\nN_3 = (8 * 7 * 6) / (6 * 5)\nN_3 = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 rational curves of degree 3 that pass through the 9 general points on the given elliptic curve."
