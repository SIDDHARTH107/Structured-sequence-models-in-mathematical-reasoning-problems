    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(3sin(2x))/dx\n\nFirst, we'll differentiate the outer function, which is 3 times the sine of something. The derivative of 3sin(u) with respect to u is 3cos(u). So, we have:\n\ndy/dx = 3cos(2x) * d(2x)/dx\n\nNow, we'll differentiate the inner function, which is 2x. The derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2. So, we have:\n\ndy/dx = 3cos(2x) * 2\n\nNow, we'll simplify the expression:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(2x)\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6cos(2(π/4))\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6cos(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, we have:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6 * 0\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 0\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) at x = π/4 is 0."
