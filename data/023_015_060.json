    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase angle of each harmonic of the standing wave on the string, we first need to express the given displacement function y(x, t) in terms of its Fourier series representation. Since the string is fixed at both ends, we can use the sine series representation:\n\ny(x, t) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L) * cos(ω_n*t + φ_n)]\n\nwhere B_n is the amplitude of the nth harmonic, ω_n is the angular frequency of the nth harmonic, φ_n is the phase angle of the nth harmonic, and L is the length of the string (10 meters in this case).\n\nWe are given y(x, t) = 2cos(3πt)sin(20πx), which can be rewritten as:\n\ny(x, t) = 2 * sin(20πx) * cos(3πt)\n\nComparing this with the sine series representation, we can see that there is only one term in the series, so we have:\n\nB_1 = 2\nn = 20\nω_1 = 3π\nφ_1 = 0\n\nThus, there is only one harmonic in the standing wave, with amplitude B_1 = 2, angular frequency ω_1 = 3π, and phase angle φ_1 = 0."
