    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, for f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\nAntiderivative of 3x^2:\nn = 2\n(3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\nAntiderivative of 4x:\nn = 1\n(4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (4x^2)/2 = 2x^2\n\nAntiderivative of -5:\nSince -5 is a constant, its antiderivative is -5x.\n\nNow, we will combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + C"
