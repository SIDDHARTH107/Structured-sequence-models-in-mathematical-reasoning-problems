    "message_1": "During a baseball game, the pitcher has a probability of 0.2 for striking out the batter, and a probability of 0.3 for the batter to hit a foul ball. What is the probability that the batter will not strike out or hit a foul ball?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the batter will not strike out or hit a foul ball, we need to find the complement of these two probabilities. \n\nThe sum of all probabilities in a sample space is equal to 1. So, we can calculate the probability of the batter not striking out or hitting a foul ball by subtracting the probabilities of striking out and hitting a foul ball from 1.\n\nProbability (Not striking out or hitting a foul ball) = 1 - (Probability of striking out + Probability of hitting a foul ball)\n\nProbability (Not striking out or hitting a foul ball) = 1 - (0.2 + 0.3)\n\nProbability (Not striking out or hitting a foul ball) = 1 - 0.5\n\nProbability (Not striking out or hitting a foul ball) = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that the batter will not strike out or hit a foul ball is 0.5 or 50%."
