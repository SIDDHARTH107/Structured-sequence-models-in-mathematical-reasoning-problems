    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative of h(x) with respect to x is h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) with respect to x.\n\nf(x) = x^3 + 2x + 1\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 + 2x + 1) = 3x^2 + 2\n\ng(x) = (x^2 + 1)^2\ng'(x) = d/dx ((x^2 + 1)^2) = 2(x^2 + 1) * d/dx (x^2 + 1) = 2(x^2 + 1) * (2x) = 4x(x^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of f(g(x)) using the chain rule:\n\nf(g(x)) = f((x^2 + 1)^2)\nf'(g(x)) = f'((x^2 + 1)^2) * g'(x) = (3(x^2 + 1)^4 + 2) * (4x(x^2 + 1))\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) is:\n\nf'(g(x)) = (3(x^2 + 1)^4 + 2) * (4x(x^2 + 1))"
