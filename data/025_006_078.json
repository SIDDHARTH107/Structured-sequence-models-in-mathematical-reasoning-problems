    "message_2": "To compute the third cohomology group of X with coefficients in the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{Z}$, we first need to find the topology of the variety X defined by the given polynomial system.\n\nLet's rewrite the polynomial system as:\n\n1) $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 10$\n\n2) $x^2 + 2y^2 - 5z^2 = 15$\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from the system by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n$-y^2 + 6z^2 = -5$\n\nNow, divide by -1:\n\n$y^2 - 6z^2 = 5$\n\nNow, let's express y in terms of z:\n\n$y^2 = 5 + 6z^2$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y^2 back into equation (1):\n\n$x^2 + (5 + 6z^2) + z^2 = 10$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$x^2 + 7z^2 = 5$\n\nNow, we can see that the variety X is a smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. Smooth quadric surfaces are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}^1$. \n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology groups of X. Since X is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}^1$, we can use the KÃ¼nneth formula to compute the cohomology groups of X:\n\n$H^3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H^3(\\mathbb{P}^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) = H^3(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes H^0(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H^2(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes H^1(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H^1(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes H^2(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H^0(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes H^3(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nSince $H^k(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k > 0$, we have:\n\n$H^3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0 \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0 \\otimes 0 \\oplus 0 \\otimes 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes 0 = 0$\n\nSo, the third cohomology group of X with coefficients in the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the trivial group:\n\n$H^3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$."
