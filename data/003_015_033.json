    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given trigonometric function f(x) = 5 sin(3x - π/6), we need to analyze the function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 5. Therefore, the amplitude of the function is |5| = 5.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the variable x inside the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The period of a basic sine function (sin(x)) is 2π. To find the period of the given function, we need to divide the basic period by the coefficient of x.\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 5 sin(3x - π/6) is 5, and the period is (2π) / 3."
