    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1000, we need to find the smallest n such that M_n > 1000 and M_n is prime.\n\nWe can start by testing n = 11, since 2^10 - 1 = 1023, which is greater than 1000. However, M_11 = 2^11 - 1 = 2047, which is not prime (23 * 89 = 2047).\n\nNext, we can try n = 13. M_13 = 2^13 - 1 = 8191, which is a prime number. Therefore, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1000 is 8191."
