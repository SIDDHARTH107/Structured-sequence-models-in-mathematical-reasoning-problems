    "message_1": "A brewery is producing two types of beer: ale and lager. The beer is made from two types of hops: type A and type B. Each barrel of ale requires 4 pounds of type A hops and 6 pounds of type B hops, while each barrel of lager requires 2 pounds of type A hops and 10 pounds of type B hops. The brewery has 120 pounds of type A hops and 180 pounds of type B hops available. If the profit for each barrel of ale is  $150 and for each barrel of lager is $200, how many barrels of each type of beer should the brewery produce to maximize profit while using all of the available hops?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of barrels of ale and y be the number of barrels of lager. We have the following constraints based on the available hops:\n\n4x + 2y ≤ 120 (type A hops constraint)\n6x + 10y ≤ 180 (type B hops constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 150x + 200y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n4x + 2y ≤ 120\n2x + y ≤ 60\ny ≤ -2x + 60\n\n6x + 10y ≤ 180\n3x + 5y ≤ 90\ny ≤ -3/5x + 18\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 18), (20, 0), and (15, 15).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 150(0) + 200(0) = $0\nP(0, 18) = 150(0) + 200(18) = $3600\nP(20, 0) = 150(20) + 200(0) = $3000\nP(15, 15) = 150(15) + 200(15) = $5250\n\nThe maximum profit of $5250 is achieved when the brewery produces 15 barrels of ale and 15 barrels of lager."
