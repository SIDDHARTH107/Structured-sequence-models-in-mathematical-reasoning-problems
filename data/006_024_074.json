    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads when flipping a fair coin 5 times, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 coin flips)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (in this case, 3 heads)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of getting a head, which is 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of getting a tail, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated using the formula: n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = (5C3) * (0.5^3) * (0.5^(5-3))\n\nFirst, we calculate 5C3:\n\n5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(2*1)) = 10\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.5^3) = 0.125\n(0.5^2) = 0.25\n\nFinally, we put it all together:\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25 = 0.3125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads when flipping a fair coin 5 times is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
