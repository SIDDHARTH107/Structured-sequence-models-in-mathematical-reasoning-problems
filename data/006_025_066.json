    "message_1": "A magician is performing a new trick in front of an audience. The magician claims that they can correctly guess the card chosen by a randomly selected audience member 80% of the time. If the audience member chooses a card at random from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability that the magician will correctly guess the chosen card?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 52 cards in a standard deck, the probability of the magician correctly guessing the chosen card by random chance is 1/52. However, the magician claims to be able to guess the card correctly 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the magician correctly guessing the chosen card is 80% of 1/52.\n\nTo calculate this, we can multiply the probability of guessing the card by random chance (1/52) by the magician's success rate (80% or 0.8):\n\n(1/52) * 0.8 = 0.8/52 â‰ˆ 0.015384615384615385\n\nSo, the probability that the magician will correctly guess the chosen card is approximately 0.0154 or 1.54%."
