    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding a non-trivial factor of a composite number. Let's apply the algorithm to find the smallest factor of 5041.\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers modulo N to integers modulo N. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N.\n2. Choose a random starting point x_0.\n3. Iterate the function to generate a sequence of numbers: x_1 = f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1), ...\n4. At each step, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x_i - x_j| and N, where i â‰  j. If the GCD is not 1 or N, it is a non-trivial factor of N.\n\nLet's choose f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 5041 and x_0 = 2.\n\n1. x_1 = f(x_0) = (2^2 + 1) mod 5041 = 5\n2. x_2 = f(x_1) = (5^2 + 1) mod 5041 = 26\n3. x_3 = f(x_2) = (26^2 + 1) mod 5041 = 677\n\nNow let's calculate the GCDs:\n\n1. GCD(|x_1 - x_0|, 5041) = GCD(|5 - 2|, 5041) = GCD(3, 5041) = 1\n2. GCD(|x_2 - x_1|, 5041) = GCD(|26 - 5|, 5041) = GCD(21, 5041) = 1\n3. GCD(|x_3 - x_2|, 5041) = GCD(|677 - 26|, 5041) = GCD(651, 5041) = 71\n\nSince the GCD(651, 5041) = 71, which is neither 1 nor 5041, we found a non-trivial factor of 5041. The smallest factor of 5041 is 71."
