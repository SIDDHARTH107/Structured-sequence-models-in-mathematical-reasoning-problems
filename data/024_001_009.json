    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position vector r(t).\n\nr(t) = (4t - 1)i + (4t^2 - 4t)j + (2t^3 - t)k\n\nFirst derivative (tangent vector):\nr'(t) = dr/dt = 4i + (8t - 4)j + (6t^2 - 1)k\n\nSecond derivative (curvature vector):\nr''(t) = d^2r/dt^2 = 8j + 12t k\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (kappa) using the formula:\n\nkappa(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nFirst, we find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (4i + (8t - 4)j + (6t^2 - 1)k) x (8j + 12t k)\n= (48t - 32)i - 48t^2j + (32 - 24t)k\n\nNow, we find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = sqrt((48t - 32)^2 + (-48t^2)^2 + (32 - 24t)^2)\n\nNext, we find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(4^2 + (8t - 4)^2 + (6t^2 - 1)^2)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nkappa(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nTo find the torsion (tau), we use the formula:\n\ntau(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, we find the third derivative of r(t):\n\nr'''(t) = d^3r/dt^3 = 12k\n\nNow, we find the dot product of (r'(t) x r''(t)) and r'''(t):\n\n(r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) = (48t - 32)i - 48t^2j + (32 - 24t)k • 12k\n= 12(32 - 24t)\n\nFinally, we find the torsion:\n\ntau(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nThe curvature (kappa) and torsion (tau) are functions of t, and their expressions are given by the formulas above. To find their values for a specific t in the range [0, 1], simply plug in the value of t into the formulas."
