    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using complex analysis, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for the given differential equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for r:\n\nr^2 = -4\nr = ±2i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution for the differential equation is given by:\n\ny(x) = e^(αx) * (C1 * cos(βx) + C2 * sin(βx))\n\nIn our case, α = 0 and β = 2, so the general solution becomes:\n\ny(x) = C1 * cos(2x) + C2 * sin(2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of C1 and C2 using the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 2\n\n1) y(0) = C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)\n1 = C1 * 1 + 0\nC1 = 1\n\n2) y'(x) = -2C1 * sin(2x) + 2C2 * cos(2x)\ny'(0) = -2C1 * sin(0) + 2C2 * cos(0)\n2 = 0 + 2C2 * 1\nC2 = 1\n\nSo, the particular solution for the given differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = cos(2x) + sin(2x)"
