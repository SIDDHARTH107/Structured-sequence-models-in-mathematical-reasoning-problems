    "message_2": "First, let's recall some definitions and theorems:\n\n1. The order of an element a in a group G is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element in G.\n2. A group G is cyclic if there exists an element a in G such that every element in G can be written as a power of a.\n3. A group G is isomorphic to another group H if there exists a bijective function f: G -> H such that f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a, b in G.\n4. Lagrange's Theorem: If G is a finite group and H is a subgroup of G, then the order of H divides the order of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: The order of a is 9.\n\nSince the order of a is 9, it means that a^9 = e and a^n ≠ e for all n < 9. Since G has 9 elements and a has order 9, we can generate all the elements of G by taking powers of a: {e, a, a^2, a^3, ..., a^8}. This means that G is a cyclic group generated by a, and thus G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nCase 2: The order of a is 3.\n\nIf the order of a is 3, then a^3 = e and a^n ≠ e for all n < 3. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, and 9. Since G has order 9, there must be another element b in G with order 3 (otherwise, G would be cyclic and isomorphic to C9, contradicting the assumption that the order of a is 3).\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by a and b. Since a and b have order 3, H must have at least 3 elements: {e, a, b}. If H has exactly 3 elements, then G would be isomorphic to C3, which contradicts the assumption that G has order 9. Therefore, H must have more than 3 elements.\n\nSince a and b have order 3, we know that a^2 ≠ e, b^2 ≠ e, and a ≠ b. Thus, H must have at least 6 elements: {e, a, a^2, b, b^2, ab}. If H has exactly 6 elements, then G would be isomorphic to a group of order 6, which contradicts the assumption that G has order 9. Therefore, H must have 9 elements, which means H = G.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of a and b: ab. Since a and b have order 3, (ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = e. Thus, the order of ab is either 1, 3, or 9. It cannot be 1, as ab ≠ e. It cannot be 9, as G is not cyclic. Therefore, the order of ab is 3.\n\nFinally, let's check if G is abelian. If G is abelian, then ab = ba. However, since a and b have order 3 and the order of ab is also 3, we have (ab)^2 = a^2b^2. If ab = ba, then a^2b^2 = a^2b^2, which means G is abelian. But this contradicts the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, G is not abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, if the order of a is 3, G is a non-abelian group of order 9."
