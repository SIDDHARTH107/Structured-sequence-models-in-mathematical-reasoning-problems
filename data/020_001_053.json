    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products - Product A and Product B. The production process for Product A requires 4 labor hours and 3 machine hours, while the production process for Product B requires 5 labor hours and 2 machine hours. The profit earned on each unit of Product A is 10 dollars and that of Product B is 15 dollars. The factory has a total of 120 labor hours and 80 machine hours available per day. Find the number of units of each type of product that the factory should produce in order to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor hours and machine hours can be represented as:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 120 (labor hours)\n3x + 2y ≤ 80 (machine hours)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (120 - 4x) / 5\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 80\ny ≤ (80 - 3x) / 2\n\nx ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (since we cannot produce a negative number of units)\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (120 - 4x) / 5 and y = (80 - 3x) / 2:\n\n(120 - 4x) / 5 = (80 - 3x) / 2\n120 - 4x = (80 - 3x) * 5 / 2\n120 - 4x = 200 - 7.5x\n3.5x = 80\nx = 80 / 3.5\nx ≈ 22.86\n\ny = (80 - 3 * 22.86) / 2\ny ≈ 6.57\n\n2. Intersection of y = (120 - 4x) / 5 and x = 0:\n\ny = (120 - 4 * 0) / 5\ny = 120 / 5\ny = 24\n\n3. Intersection of y = (80 - 3x) / 2 and x = 0:\n\ny = (80 - 3 * 0) / 2\ny = 80 / 2\ny = 40\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 15y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(22.86, 6.57) ≈ 10 * 22.86 + 15 * 6.57 ≈ 228.6 + 98.55 ≈ 327.15\n2. P(0, 24) = 10 * 0 + 15 * 24 = 360\n3. P(0, 40) = 10 * 0 + 15 * 40 = 600\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (0, 40), which corresponds to producing 0 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B. The maximum profit is 600 dollars."
