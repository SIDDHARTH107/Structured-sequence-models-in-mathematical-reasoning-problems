    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem related to Prisoner's Dilemma:\n\nTwo criminals, A and B, are arrested and brought in for questioning. They are kept in separate cells and cannot communicate with each other. The district attorney offers each the same deal:\n- If both remain silent, each will serve one year for a minor charge.\n- If one confesses and the other remains silent, the one who confesses will be set free while the other serves three years for a major charge.\n- If both confess, each will serve two years for a major charge.\n\nAssuming that A and B are rational and self-interested, what is the best strategy for each of them, and what is the likely outcome of this situation?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for each criminal, let's analyze the possible outcomes based on their decisions:\n\n1. If A remains silent and B remains silent, both serve 1 year.\n2. If A remains silent and B confesses, A serves 3 years and B is set free.\n3. If A confesses and B remains silent, A is set free and B serves 3 years.\n4. If A confesses and B confesses, both serve 2 years.\n\nFor each criminal, they need to consider the best outcome for themselves based on the possible actions of the other criminal. \n\nFor A:\n- If A believes B will remain silent, A's best strategy is to confess (0 years instead of 1 year).\n- If A believes B will confess, A's best strategy is also to confess (2 years instead of 3 years).\n\nFor B:\n- If B believes A will remain silent, B's best strategy is to confess (0 years instead of 1 year).\n- If B believes A will confess, B's best strategy is also to confess (2 years instead of 3 years).\n\nIn both cases, the best strategy for each criminal is to confess, regardless of what they believe the other will do. This is because confessing leads to a better outcome for each individual in either scenario.\n\nTherefore, the likely outcome of this situation is that both A and B will confess, and each will serve two years for a major charge. This is known as the Nash equilibrium in the Prisoner's Dilemma, where both players choose the best strategy for themselves, given the strategies chosen by the other player."
