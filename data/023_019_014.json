    "message_2": "To find the stability of the system described by the differential equation y'' + 4y = 0 using the Fourier transform method, we first need to apply the Fourier transform to the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of a function y(t) is defined as:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[y(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nNow, let's apply the Fourier transform to the given differential equation:\n\nFourier{y''(t) + 4y(t)} = Fourier{0}\n\nUsing the linearity property of the Fourier transform, we can write:\n\nFourier{y''(t)} + 4 * Fourier{y(t)} = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transforms of y''(t) and y(t). The Fourier transform of the second derivative y''(t) is given by:\n\nFourier{y''(t)} = (jω)^2 * Y(ω) = -ω^2 * Y(ω)\n\nThe Fourier transform of y(t) is simply Y(ω). Now, we can substitute these into the equation:\n\n-ω^2 * Y(ω) + 4 * Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) * (-ω^2 + 4) = 0\n\nFor the system to be stable, the Fourier transform Y(ω) should not blow up (i.e., it should not go to infinity). This means that the term inside the parenthesis should be equal to zero:\n\n-ω^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for ω, we get:\n\nω^2 = 4\nω = ±2\n\nSince the angular frequency ω is real and finite, the system is stable. The stability of the system is determined by the roots of the characteristic equation, which in this case are real and non-repeated. Therefore, the system is stable."
