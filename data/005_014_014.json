    "message_1": "In a factor analysis, a dataset of 100 observations is used to identify underlying factors. Given a correlation matrix of the variables, factor analysis yields eigenvalues which reflect the proportion of total variance accounted for by each factor. If the first four eigenvalues were 10.15, 5.87, 1.90, and 0.56 respectively, what is the percentage of total variance explained by the first two factors?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of total variance explained by the first two factors, we need to first calculate the total variance explained by all the factors. We do this by adding up all the eigenvalues:\n\nTotal variance = 10.15 + 5.87 + 1.90 + 0.56 = 18.48\n\nNext, we calculate the variance explained by the first two factors by adding their eigenvalues:\n\nVariance explained by first two factors = 10.15 + 5.87 = 16.02\n\nNow, we can find the percentage of total variance explained by the first two factors by dividing the variance explained by the first two factors by the total variance and multiplying by 100:\n\nPercentage of total variance explained by first two factors = (16.02 / 18.48) * 100 = 0.8668 * 100 = 86.68%\n\nSo, the first two factors explain 86.68% of the total variance."
