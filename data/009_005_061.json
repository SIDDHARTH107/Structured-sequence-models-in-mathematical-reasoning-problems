    "message_1": "A circuit has an inductor of inductance 4H, a resistance of 8 ohms, and a capacitor of capacitance 0.002 F. If the voltage of the circuit is given by V(t) = 10sin(50t), find the current in the circuit.",
    "message_2": "To find the current in the circuit, we need to solve the second-order differential equation for the current I(t) in an RLC circuit. The equation is given by:\n\nL * (d^2I(t)/dt^2) + R * (dI(t)/dt) + (1/C) * I(t) = V(t)\n\nwhere L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, and V(t) is the voltage function.\n\nGiven values:\nL = 4 H\nR = 8 Ω\nC = 0.002 F\nV(t) = 10sin(50t)\n\nNow, we need to solve the following differential equation:\n\n4 * (d^2I(t)/dt^2) + 8 * (dI(t)/dt) + (1/0.002) * I(t) = 10sin(50t)\n\n4 * (d^2I(t)/dt^2) + 8 * (dI(t)/dt) + 500 * I(t) = 10sin(50t)\n\nTo solve this equation, we will first find the complementary solution (I_c) by setting the right-hand side to zero:\n\n4 * (d^2I_c(t)/dt^2) + 8 * (dI_c(t)/dt) + 500 * I_c(t) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n4r^2 + 8r + 500 = 0\n\nWe can solve for r using the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nr = (-8 ± √(8^2 - 4 * 4 * 500)) / (2 * 4)\n\nr = (-8 ± √(-7936)) / 8\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots:\n\nr = -1 ± j√(1984)\n\nThe complementary solution is given by:\n\nI_c(t) = e^(-t) * (A * cos(√1984 * t) + B * sin(√1984 * t))\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution (I_p) for the non-homogeneous equation. Since the forcing function is a sine function, we will assume a particular solution of the form:\n\nI_p(t) = C * cos(50t) + D * sin(50t)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives of I_p(t):\n\ndI_p(t)/dt = -50C * sin(50t) + 50D * cos(50t)\nd^2I_p(t)/dt^2 = -2500C * cos(50t) - 2500D * sin(50t)\n\nSubstituting I_p(t) and its derivatives into the original differential equation:\n\n4 * (-2500C * cos(50t) - 2500D * sin(50t)) + 8 * (-50C * sin(50t) + 50D * cos(50t)) + 500 * (C * cos(50t) + D * sin(50t)) = 10sin(50t)\n\nSimplifying and equating the coefficients of sin(50t) and cos(50t):\n\n-10000D + 400D + 500D = 10 (for sin(50t))\n-10000C - 400C + 500C = 0 (for cos(50t))\n\nSolving these equations:\n\nC = 0\nD = 10 / 900\n\nThe particular solution is:\n\nI_p(t) = (10/900) * sin(50t)\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\nI(t) = e^(-t) * (A * cos(√1984 * t) + B * sin(√1984 * t)) + (10/900) * sin(50t)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we would need initial conditions for the current and its derivative. However, since these conditions are not provided, we can only present the general solution as the answer:\n\nI(t) = e^(-t) * (A * cos(√1984 * t) + B * sin(√1984 * t)) + (1/90) * sin(50t)"
