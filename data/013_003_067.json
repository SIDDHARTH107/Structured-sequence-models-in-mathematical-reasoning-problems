    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A is given a pot of $10 and has to propose a division of the money to Player B. Player B can either accept or reject the offer. If Player B accepts, the money is split according to the proposed division. If Player B rejects, neither player gets any money. If Player A offers Player B $2, what is the minimum amount that Player B should accept in order to receive a positive payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum amount that Player B should accept in order to receive a positive payoff is any amount greater than $0. If Player B accepts any offer greater than $0, they will receive a positive payoff. In the given scenario, if Player A offers Player B $2, Player B should accept it, as it is greater than $0 and results in a positive payoff for Player B."
