    "message_2": "The perimeter (circumference) of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 8 cm, we can calculate the circumference (C) as follows:\n\nC = πd\nC = π × 8 cm\nC ≈ 3.14 × 8 cm\nC ≈ 25.12 cm\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 25.12 cm."
