    "message_2": "Differential evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm that is typically used for continuous optimization problems. However, for this problem, we can find the minimum value of the function f(x) using calculus, specifically by finding the critical points of the function and analyzing them within the given domain.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 + 5x + 10)/dx = 4x + 5\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n\n4x + 5 = 0\n4x = -5\nx = -5/4 = -1.25\n\nNow we have one critical point, x = -1.25. We need to check the endpoints of the domain as well to make sure we find the minimum value of f(x) within the domain -5 ≤ x ≤ 5.\n\nf(-5) = 2(-5)^2 + 5(-5) + 10 = 50\nf(-1.25) = 2(-1.25)^2 + 5(-1.25) + 10 = 6.875\nf(5) = 2(5)^2 + 5(5) + 10 = 80\n\nComparing the values of f(x) at the critical point and the endpoints, we find that the minimum value of f(x) within the domain -5 ≤ x ≤ 5 is 6.875, which occurs at x = -1.25."
