    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/R)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and R is the scaling factor (the removal ratio).\n\nIn the case of the Cantor dust, at each iteration, the line segment is divided into 3 equal parts, and the middle part (1/3 of the length) is removed. So, the scaling factor R is 1/3. After the removal, there are 2 self-similar pieces left (N = 2).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(2) / log(1/(1/3))\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.6309."
