    "message_1": "A student is trying to analyze a wave propagation problem and they have been given the following function:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(3x) + 3cos(5x)\n\nUsing the Fourier transform, what is the amplitude and frequency of each component wave?",
    "message_2": "The given function f(x) is already in the form of a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and frequency of each component wave. We can directly read the amplitude and frequency from the function.\n\nThe function f(x) consists of two component waves:\n\n1. The first component wave is a sine wave with an amplitude of 2 and a frequency of 3 (angular frequency ω = 3). So, the amplitude is 2 and the frequency is 3/(2π) = 3/6.283 ≈ 0.477 Hz.\n\n2. The second component wave is a cosine wave with an amplitude of 3 and a frequency of 5 (angular frequency ω = 5). So, the amplitude is 3 and the frequency is 5/(2π) = 5/6.283 ≈ 0.795 Hz.\n\nIn summary, the component waves have amplitudes of 2 and 3, and frequencies of approximately 0.477 Hz and 0.795 Hz, respectively."
