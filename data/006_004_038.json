    "message_2": "There are 4 numbers greater than 2 on a six-sided die (3, 4, 5, and 6). Since the die is fair, each number has an equal probability of being rolled. There are 6 possible outcomes in total (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 3, 4, 5, or 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6).\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 4/6\n\nTo simplify the fraction, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.\n\nProbability = (4/2) / (6/2) = 2/3\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a fair six-sided die is 2/3, or approximately 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)."
