    "message_1": "If we have a substitution cipher where each letter of the alphabet is replaced with another letter (not a letter it already represents) from the same alphabet, how many possible substitution ciphers are there?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible substitution ciphers, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these 26 letters.\n\nThe first letter can be replaced by any of the remaining 25 letters (since it cannot be replaced by itself). The second letter can be replaced by any of the remaining 24 letters (again, not by itself and not by the letter chosen for the first one), and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of possible substitution ciphers can be calculated as:\n\n26! / (1! * 1! * 1! * ... * 1!) = 26! / 1 = 26!\n\n26! (26 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 26:\n\n26! = 26 × 25 × 24 × ... × 2 × 1 ≈ 4.03 × 10^26\n\nSo, there are approximately 4.03 × 10^26 possible substitution ciphers."
