Suppose α, β, and γ are compact orientable, codimension 1 submanifolds of M such that:\n\n- α, β, and γ are in generic position;\n- each intersection is transverse; and\n- each submanifold is oriented such that the orientation induced by M agrees with the given orientation.\n\nFind the intersection number of α, β, and γ in terms of [M].",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection number of α, β, and γ in terms of [M], we will use the Poincaré duality and the intersection product.\n\nSince M is a closed orientable 3-manifold, the Poincaré duality states that the homology groups H_i(M) are isomorphic to the cohomology groups H^{3-i}(M) for i = 0, 1, 2, 3. In particular, we have isomorphisms:\n\nH_1(M) ≅ H^2(M) and H_2(M) ≅ H^1(M).\n\nNow, let [α], [β], and [γ] be the homology classes represented by the submanifolds α, β, and γ, respectively. Since α, β, and γ are codimension 1 submanifolds, they have dimension 2, and their homology classes are in H_2(M). By Poincaré duality, we can associate cohomology classes [α]^*, [β]^*, and [γ]^* in H^1(M) to [α], [β], and [γ], respectively.\n\nThe intersection product is a bilinear map:\n\n∩: H_2(M) × H_2(M) → H_3(M).\n\nWe can compute the intersection number of α, β, and γ by taking the intersection product of their homology classes and pairing it with the fundamental class [M] using the Kronecker product:\n\n⟨[α] ∩ [β] ∩ [γ], [M]⟩ = ⟨[α] ∩ [β], [γ]^* ∪ [M]⟩.\n\nBy Poincaré duality, we have:\n\n⟨[α] ∩ [β], [γ]^* ∪ [M]⟩ = ⟨[α] ∩ [β], [γ]^*⟩,\n\nwhere the right-hand side is the Kronecker product of [α] ∩ [β] with [γ]^* in H^1(M).\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection number of α, β, and γ as follows:\n\n⟨[α] ∩ [β] ∩ [γ], [M]⟩ = ⟨[α] ∩ [β], [γ]^*⟩ = ⟨[α], [β]^* ∪ [γ]^*⟩.\n\nSince α, β, and γ are in generic position and their intersections are transverse, the intersection number of α, β, and γ is equal to the algebraic count of the points in α ∩ β ∩ γ. This is the desired expression for the intersection number of α, β, and γ in terms of [M]."
