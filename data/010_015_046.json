    "message_2": "To prove the existence of a smooth $(n-k-1)$-form $\\eta$ on $M$ such that $\\omega \\wedge \\eta$ is a non-zero volume form on $M$, we will use the Hodge decomposition theorem.\n\nThe Hodge decomposition theorem states that for any compact, connected, and oriented $n$-dimensional smooth manifold $M$ without boundary, there exists a unique decomposition of the space of smooth $k$-forms $\\Omega^k(M)$ into the direct sum of the space of exact $k$-forms $d\\Omega^{k-1}(M)$, the space of co-exact $k$-forms $d^*\\Omega^{k+1}(M)$, and the space of harmonic $k$-forms $\\mathcal{H}^k(M)$, i.e.,\n\n$$\\Omega^k(M) = d\\Omega^{k-1}(M) \\oplus d^*\\Omega^{k+1}(M) \\oplus \\mathcal{H}^k(M).$$\n\nSince $\\omega$ is closed and non-exact, it must be a harmonic form, i.e., $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{H}^k(M)$. By the Hodge decomposition theorem, there exists a unique $(n-k-1)$-form $\\eta \\in \\Omega^{n-k-1}(M)$ such that\n\n$$\\omega \\wedge \\eta = d\\alpha + d^*\\beta,$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha \\in \\Omega^{k-1}(M)$ and $\\beta \\in \\Omega^{n-k}(M)$. Since $\\omega$ is closed, we have $d\\omega = 0$. Therefore, $d(\\omega \\wedge \\eta) = (d\\omega) \\wedge \\eta + (-1)^k \\omega \\wedge d\\eta = 0$. This implies that $\\omega \\wedge \\eta$ is a closed $(n-1)$-form.\n\nNow, we need to show that $\\omega \\wedge \\eta$ is a non-zero volume form. Suppose, for contradiction, that $\\omega \\wedge \\eta = 0$. Then, by the Hodge decomposition theorem, there exists a unique $(n-k)$-form $\\gamma \\in \\Omega^{n-k}(M)$ such that\n\n$$\\omega \\wedge \\eta = d\\gamma.$$\n\nSince $\\omega \\wedge \\eta = 0$, we have $d\\gamma = 0$. This implies that $\\gamma$ is a closed $(n-k)$-form. However, this contradicts the assumption that $\\omega$ is non-exact, as $\\omega \\wedge \\eta = d\\gamma$ implies that $\\omega$ is exact. Therefore, $\\omega \\wedge \\eta$ must be a non-zero volume form on $M$.\n\nNow, we will prove that the degree of the cohomology class $[\\omega]$ in the de Rham cohomology group $H^k_{dR}(M)$ is equal to the degree of the cohomology class $[\\eta]$ in $H^{n-k-1}_{dR}(M)$.\n\nRecall that the degree of a cohomology class $[\\alpha]$ in $H^k_{dR}(M)$ is defined as the integer $k$. Since $\\omega$ is a closed $k$-form and $\\eta$ is a closed $(n-k-1)$-form, we have\n\n$$\\deg([\\omega]) = k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\deg([\\eta]) = n-k-1.$$\n\nTo show that $\\deg([\\omega]) = \\deg([\\eta])$, we need to show that $k = n-k-1$. This is equivalent to showing that $2k + 1 = n$. Since $\\omega \\wedge \\eta$ is a non-zero volume form on $M$, we have\n\n$$\\deg([\\omega \\wedge \\eta]) = \\deg([\\omega]) + \\deg([\\eta]) = k + (n-k-1) = n-1.$$\n\nHowever, the degree of a volume form on an $n$-dimensional manifold is $n-1$. Therefore, we have $2k + 1 = n$, which implies that $\\deg([\\omega]) = \\deg([\\eta])$."
