    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n6x + 4yi = 22 + 12i\n\nSecond equation * 3:\n6x - 15yi = -12 + 27i\n\nNow, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x:\n\n(6x + 4yi) - (6x - 15yi) = (22 + 12i) - (-12 + 27i)\n\n6x + 4yi - 6x + 15yi = 22 + 12i + 12 - 27i\n\n19yi = 34 - 15i\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by 19i:\n\ny = (34 - 15i) / 19i\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary unit in the denominator, we will multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is -19i:\n\ny = ((34 - 15i) * -19i) / (19i * -19i)\n\ny = (-646i + 285i^2) / 361i^2\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can substitute -1 for i^2:\n\ny = (-646i - 285) / -361\n\nNow, we will divide both the real and imaginary parts by -361:\n\ny = 285/-361 + 646i/-361\n\ny ≈ 0.79 - 1.79i\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. We will use the first equation:\n\n3x + 2yi = 11 + 6i\n\n3x + 2(0.79 - 1.79i)i = 11 + 6i\n\n3x + 1.58i - 3.58i^2 = 11 + 6i\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can substitute -1 for i^2:\n\n3x - 1.58i + 3.58 = 11 + 6i\n\nNow, we will group the real and imaginary parts:\n\n3x + 3.58 = 11\n-1.58i = 6i\n\nFirst, we will solve for x:\n\n3x = 11 - 3.58\n3x = 7.42\nx = 7.42 / 3\nx ≈ 2.47\n\nNow, we will solve for i:\n\n-1.58i = 6i\ni = 6i / -1.58\ni ≈ -3.8\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the value of y, not i, we already have the value of y:\n\ny ≈ 0.79 - 1.79i\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx ≈ 2.47\ny ≈ 0.79 - 1.79i"
