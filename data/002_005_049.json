    "message_1": "What is the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism with dimensions 6 cm x 8 cm x 10 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. If the dimensions of the rectangular prism are length (l), width (w), and height (h), then the diagonal (d) can be found using the formula:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nIn this case, the dimensions are 6 cm (length), 8 cm (width), and 10 cm (height). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √(6² + 8² + 10²)\nd = √(36 + 64 + 100)\nd = √(200)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √(200) cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
