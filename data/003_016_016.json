    "message_2": "To find the phase shift of the given sinusoidal wave, we need to look at the equation and identify the value inside the cosine function that is being added or subtracted from the variable x. The general form of a sinusoidal wave is:\n\ny = A cos(B(x - C)) + D\n\nWhere A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 3 cos(2x + pi/4), we can see that it is in the form of:\n\ny = 3 cos(2(x + pi/8))\n\nComparing this with the general form, we can identify that the phase shift C is pi/8.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the given sinusoidal wave is pi/8."
