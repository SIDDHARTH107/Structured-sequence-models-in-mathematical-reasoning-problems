    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of the Playfair cipher using the given key and plaintext.\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in this cipher).\n\nKey: EXAMPLE\nGrid:\nE X A M P\nL B C D F\nG H I K N\nO Q R S T\nU V W Y Z\n\n2. Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the plaintext has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\nPlaintext: MATH\nDigraphs: MA TH\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nDigraph 1: MA\nM -> P (same row, next letter)\nA -> X (same row, next letter)\n\nDigraph 2: TH\nT -> U (same column, letter below)\nH -> K (same column, letter below)\n\n4. Combine the new digraphs to form the ciphertext.\n\nCiphertext: PX UK"
