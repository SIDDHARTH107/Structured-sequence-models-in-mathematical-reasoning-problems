    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nB × A = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the unions with the set {1}:\n\n(A × B) ∪ {1} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), 1}\n(B × A) ∪ {1} = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), 1}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product of two sets is associative with respect to union. To do this, we need to check if (A × B) ∪ C = A × (B ∪ C) for any set C. Let's take C = {4} as an example:\n\nB ∪ C = {2, 3, 4}\nA × (B ∪ C) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\n(A × B) ∪ C = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), 4}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ C ≠ A × (B ∪ C). Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
