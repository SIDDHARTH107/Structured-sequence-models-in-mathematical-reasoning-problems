    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit for product A is $10 and for product B it is $12. They have a weekly production capacity of 500 units. It takes 2 hours to manufacture one unit of A and 3 hours to manufacture one unit of B. The total available production time per week is 1200 hours. Formulate a non-convex optimization problem to determine the number of units of each product that should be produced in order to maximize the weekly profit of the company.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 500\n2. Time constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 1200\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nHowever, the given problem is already a convex optimization problem since the objective function and constraints are linear. In order to make it a non-convex optimization problem, we can introduce a non-linear constraint or modify the objective function to be non-linear. For example, we can add a constraint that represents a minimum required ratio of product A to product B:\n\n4. Non-convex constraint: x^2 ≥ k * y, where k is a positive constant.\n\nNow, the problem becomes a non-convex optimization problem:\n\nMaximize P = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to:\n1. x + y ≤ 500\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 1200\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n4. x^2 ≥ k * y"
