Use the median to identify any outliers and explain why the median is a more appropriate measure of central tendency in this case than the mean.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the test scores in ascending order: 75, 76, 77, 81, 85, 86, 89, 91, 93, 93.\n\nTo find the median, we take the average of the middle two numbers since there are an even number of scores: (85 + 86) / 2 = 85.5. So, the median is 85.5.\n\nNext, we need to find the interquartile range (IQR). To do this, we first find the lower quartile (Q1) and the upper quartile (Q3). Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data.\n\nLower half: 75, 76, 77, 81, 85\nUpper half: 86, 89, 91, 93, 93\n\nQ1 = (77 + 81) / 2 = 79\nQ3 = (91 + 93) / 2 = 92\n\nNow, we can calculate the IQR: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 92 - 79 = 13.\n\nTo identify any outliers, we can use the 1.5 * IQR rule. Any data point below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR is considered an outlier.\n\nLower bound: 79 - 1.5 * 13 = 60.5\nUpper bound: 92 + 1.5 * 13 = 110.5\n\nSince all the test scores are within the range of 60.5 to 110.5, there are no outliers.\n\nThe median is a more appropriate measure of central tendency in this case than the mean because it is less sensitive to extreme values or outliers. If there were any outliers in the data, the mean would be influenced by those extreme values, while the median would remain relatively stable. In this case, although there are no outliers, using the median ensures that the measure of central tendency is not affected by any potential extreme values."
