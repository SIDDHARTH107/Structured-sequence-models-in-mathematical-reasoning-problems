    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply need to add the lengths of all four sides together.\n\nPerimeter = length of first parallel side + length of second parallel side + length of first non-parallel side + length of second non-parallel side\n\nPerimeter = 5 cm + 10 cm + 7 cm + 8 cm\n\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 30 cm."
