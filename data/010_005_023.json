    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible connected subsets of a topological space X with 10 elements, we need to consider the properties of connectedness and the structure of the topology on X. However, without information about the specific topology on X, we cannot determine the exact number of connected subsets.\n\nIn general, a topological space can have various topologies, ranging from the discrete topology (where every subset is open and thus connected) to the trivial topology (where only the empty set and the whole space are open). The number of connected subsets will depend on the specific topology.\n\nFor example, if X has the discrete topology, every subset is connected, and there are 2^10 = 1024 possible subsets (including the empty set and the whole space). On the other hand, if X has the trivial topology, only the empty set and the whole space are connected, resulting in just 2 connected subsets.\n\nWithout more information about the topology on X, we cannot determine the exact number of connected subsets."
