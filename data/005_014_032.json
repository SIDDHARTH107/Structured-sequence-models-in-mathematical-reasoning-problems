    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset with 10 variables and you want to extract the underlying factors that influence these variables. Performing a factor analysis, you obtain an eigenvalue of 4.5 for the first factor. What percentage of the total variability in the data is explained by this factor?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage of the total variability explained by the first factor, we need to know the total eigenvalues for all the factors. Since there are 10 variables, the total eigenvalues will be equal to the number of variables, which is 10.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of the total variability explained by the first factor with the eigenvalue of 4.5:\n\nPercentage = (Eigenvalue of the first factor / Total eigenvalues) * 100\nPercentage = (4.5 / 10) * 100\nPercentage = 0.45 * 100\nPercentage = 45%\n\nSo, the first factor explains 45% of the total variability in the data."
