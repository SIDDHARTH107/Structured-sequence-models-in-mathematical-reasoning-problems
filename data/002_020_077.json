    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the arc length of the sector and add it to the two radii.\n\nThe formula for the arc length (L) of a sector is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is a constant (approximately 3.14159).\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the central angle (θ) is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2π(5)\nL = (1/6) × 10π\nL = 10π/6\n\nNow, simplify the fraction:\n\nL = 5π/3 cm\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we need to add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter = (5π/3) + 2(5)\nPerimeter = (5π/3) + 10\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is (5π/3) + 10 cm."
