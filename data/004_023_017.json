    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 - 1 and y = 2x - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 - 1 = 2x - x^2\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(2x - 1)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the points of intersection are x = 1/2 and x = 1. Now, we need to find the corresponding y-values for these x-values:\n\ny = (1/2)^2 - 1 = -3/4\ny = (1)^2 - 1 = 0\n\nThus, the points of intersection are (1/2, -3/4) and (1, 0).\n\nNow, we'll integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [1/2, 1]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2 - (x^2 - 1)) dx from 1/2 to 1\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 2x^2 + 1) dx from 1/2 to 1\n\nNow, integrate:\n\nArea = [x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + x] from 1/2 to 1\n\nEvaluate the definite integral:\n\nArea = (1^2 - (2/3)(1)^3 + 1) - ((1/2)^2 - (2/3)(1/2)^3 + (1/2))\nArea = (1 - 2/3 + 1) - (1/4 - 1/12 + 1/2)\nArea = (4/3) - (1/4 + 1/12)\nArea = (4/3) - (3/12)\nArea = (4/3) - (1/4)\nArea = (13/12)\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 - 1 and y = 2x - x^2 is 13/12 square units."
