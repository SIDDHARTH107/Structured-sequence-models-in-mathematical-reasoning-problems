    "message_1": "Assuming two hunters, Hunter 1 and Hunter 2, are out hunting. They each have a choice between hunting a stag, which requires cooperation and will yield 8 points on a scale of 1-10, or hunting a rabbit, which can be done individually and will yield 3 points. If the hunters decide to hunt a stag, they must both cooperate and it is only successful if both of them choose to hunt a stag. If one hunter chooses to hunt a stag and the other chooses to hunt a rabbit, the stag will get away and each hunter will receive 1 point. However, if both hunters choose to hunt a rabbit, then both of them will receive 2 points. What is the best strategy for Hunter 1 and what is his/her expected payoff if Hunter 2 always chooses to hunt a stag?",
    "message_2": "If Hunter 2 always chooses to hunt a stag, the best strategy for Hunter 1 is to also choose to hunt a stag. This is because if both hunters cooperate and choose to hunt a stag, they will each receive 8 points, which is the highest possible payoff.\n\nIn this scenario, Hunter 1's expected payoff is 8 points, as both hunters are choosing to hunt a stag and successfully cooperating."
