The distances (in miles) between the cities are as follows:\n- City 1 to City 2: 10 miles\n- City 1 to City 3: 15 miles\n- City 1 to City 4: 20 miles\n- City 1 to City 5: 25 miles\n- City 2 to City 3: 12 miles\n- City 2 to City 4: 15 miles\n- City 2 to City 5: 18 miles\n- City 3 to City 4: 11 miles\n- City 3 to City 5: 10 miles\n- City 4 to City 5: 8 miles\n\nWhat is the shortest possible route (in miles) that the salesman can take to visit all 5 cities exactly once and return to the starting city? Use the traveling salesman problem to find a solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest possible route that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. We can use the brute force method to find the solution, as there are only 5 cities. \n\nThere are (5-1)! = 4! = 24 possible routes, considering that the salesman starts and ends at the same city. Let's list all the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1. 1-2-3-4-5-1: 10 + 12 + 11 + 8 + 25 = 66 miles\n2. 1-2-3-5-4-1: 10 + 12 + 10 + 8 + 20 = 60 miles\n3. 1-2-4-3-5-1: 10 + 15 + 11 + 10 + 25 = 71 miles\n4. 1-2-4-5-3-1: 10 + 15 + 8 + 10 + 15 = 58 miles\n5. 1-2-5-3-4-1: 10 + 18 + 10 + 11 + 20 = 69 miles\n6. 1-2-5-4-3-1: 10 + 18 + 8 + 11 + 15 = 62 miles\n7. 1-3-2-4-5-1: 15 + 12 + 15 + 8 + 25 = 75 miles\n8. 1-3-2-5-4-1: 15 + 12 + 18 + 8 + 20 = 73 miles\n9. 1-3-4-2-5-1: 15 + 11 + 15 + 18 + 25 = 84 miles\n10. 1-3-4-5-2-1: 15 + 11 + 8 + 18 + 10 = 62 miles\n11. 1-3-5-2-4-1: 15 + 10 + 18 + 15 + 20 = 78 miles\n12. 1-3-5-4-2-1: 15 + 10 + 8 + 15 + 10 = 58 miles\n13. 1-4-2-3-5-1: 20 + 15 + 12 + 10 + 25 = 82 miles\n14. 1-4-2-5-3-1: 20 + 15 + 18 + 10 + 15 = 78 miles\n15. 1-4-3-2-5-1: 20 + 11 + 12 + 18 + 25 = 86 miles\n16. 1-4-3-5-2-1: 20 + 11 + 10 + 18 + 10 = 69 miles\n17. 1-4-5-2-3-1: 20 + 8 + 18 + 12 + 15 = 73 miles\n18. 1-4-5-3-2-1: 20 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 10 = 60 miles\n19. 1-5-2-3-4-1: 25 + 18 + 12 + 11 + 20 = 86 miles\n20. 1-5-2-4-3-1: 25 + 18 + 15 + 11 + 15 = 84 miles\n21. 1-5-3-2-4-1: 25 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 = 82 miles\n22. 1-5-3-4-2-1: 25 + 10 + 11 + 15 + 10 = 71 miles\n23. 1-5-4-2-3-1: 25 + 8 + 15 + 12 + 15 = 75 miles\n24. 1-5-4-3-2-1: 25 + 8 + 11 + 12 + 10 = 66 miles\n\nThe shortest possible route is route 4: 1-2-4-5-3-1, with a total distance of 58 miles."
