    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed curve is zero. In other words, if f(z) is analytic in a simply connected domain D and C is a closed curve in D, then the integral of f(z) over C is zero.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the function f(z) is analytic. A function is analytic if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function f(z) = z^3 - 2z + 1 is a polynomial, and polynomials are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic and the curve C is a closed curve (a circle), we can apply Cauchy's theorem. The integral of f(z) over the curve C is:\n\nâˆ®[f(z)dz] = 0\n\nSo, the integral of f(z) = z^3 - 2z + 1 over the curve C, which is the circle centered at 2+3i with radius 5, is 0."
