    "message_2": "First, we solve the homogeneous differential equation $y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0$. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$r^2 - 4r + 4 = 0$\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\n$(r - 2)^2 = 0$\n\nSo, we have a repeated root $r = 2$. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\n$y_h(x) = (c_1 + c_2x)e^{2x}$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 0$:\n\n$y_h(0) = (c_1 + c_2(0))e^{2(0)} = c_1 = 0$\n\n$y_h'(x) = (c_2 + 2c_2x)e^{2x}$\n\n$y_h'(0) = (c_2 + 2c_2(0))e^{2(0)} = c_2 = 0$\n\nSince both $c_1$ and $c_2$ are zero, the homogeneous solution is trivial, i.e., $y_h(x) = 0$. \n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution that satisfies the non-homogeneous boundary condition $y''(1) + y'(1) + y(1) = 12$. Let's assume a particular solution of the form:\n\n$y_p(x) = Axe^{2x}$\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives:\n\n$y_p'(x) = (2Ax + A)e^{2x}$\n\n$y_p''(x) = (4Ax + 4A)e^{2x}$\n\nNow, we plug in $x = 1$ into the boundary condition:\n\n$y_p''(1) + y_p'(1) + y_p(1) = (4A + 4A)e^{2} + (2A + A)e^{2} + Ae^{2} = 12$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$7Ae^2 = 12$\n\nSolving for A:\n\n$A = \\frac{12}{7e^2}$\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\n$y_p(x) = \\frac{12}{7e^2}xe^{2x}$\n\nFinally, the general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\n$y(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x) = 0 + \\frac{12}{7e^2}xe^{2x} = \\frac{12}{7e^2}xe^{2x}$"
