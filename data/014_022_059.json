    "message_1": "Suppose the following Playfair Cipher encrypted message was intercepted: \"HU NB HM OF ST XY JU\". Assuming that the Playfair Cipher has been used with a 5x5 key table, with the letters of the keyword \"CODE\" filling the first five positions, and the remaining positions filled with the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet in sequence, what was the original plaintext message?",
    "message_2": "First, let's create the 5x5 key table using the keyword \"CODE\" and the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet in sequence:\n\nC O D E A\nB F G H I\nJ K L M N\nP Q R S T\nU V W X Y\n\nNow, let's decrypt the intercepted message \"HU NB HM OF ST XY JU\" using the Playfair Cipher rules:\n\n1. HU: H and U are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left (wrap around if necessary): G and T.\n2. NB: N and B are in the same column, so replace them with the letters above them (wrap around if necessary): M and C.\n3. HM: H and M are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle with them and replace them with the letters in the same row but on the other corner of the rectangle: G and L.\n4. OF: O and F are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left (wrap around if necessary): E and B.\n5. ST: S and T are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left (wrap around if necessary): R and S.\n6. XY: X and Y are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left (wrap around if necessary): W and U.\n7. JU: J and U are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle with them and replace them with the letters in the same row but on the other corner of the rectangle: I and P.\n\nThe decrypted message is: \"GT MC GL EB RS WU IP\"."
