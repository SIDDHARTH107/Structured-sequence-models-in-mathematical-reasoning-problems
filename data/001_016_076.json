    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we can use the properties of exponents. When multiplying exponential expressions with the same base, we add the exponents: \n\n$2^3 \\cdot 2^4 = 2^{3+4} = 2^7$\n\nNow, when dividing exponential expressions with the same base, we subtract the exponents:\n\n$2^7 \\div 2^2 = 2^{7-2} = 2^5$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is $2^5$."
