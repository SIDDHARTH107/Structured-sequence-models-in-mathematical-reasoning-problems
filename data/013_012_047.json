    "message_1": "A company, XYZ Ltd., is planning to launch a new product in the market. There is already a competitor, ABC Corp., selling a similar product. The market demand for this product is given by Q = 200 - 2P, where Q is the quantity and P is the price. The cost of production for XYZ Ltd. is $40,000, while for ABC Corp., it is $60,000. Assuming that XYZ Ltd. acts as a leader in Stackelberg competition, determine the quantity produced and the price charged by both companies to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction functions for both companies and then find the equilibrium quantities and prices.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse demand function by solving for P in terms of Q:\n\nQ = 200 - 2P\n2P = 200 - Q\nP = (200 - Q) / 2\n\nLet q1 be the quantity produced by XYZ Ltd. and q2 be the quantity produced by ABC Corp. Then, the total quantity Q = q1 + q2.\n\nNow, let's find the profit functions for both companies:\n\nProfit_XYZ = (P * q1) - 40,000\nProfit_ABC = (P * q2) - 60,000\n\nSubstitute the inverse demand function into the profit functions:\n\nProfit_XYZ = ((200 - (q1 + q2)) / 2 * q1) - 40,000\nProfit_ABC = ((200 - (q1 + q2)) / 2 * q2) - 60,000\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to find the first-order conditions by taking the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to the respective quantities and setting them equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit_XYZ)/dq1 = (200 - 2q1 - q2)/2 = 0\nd(Profit_ABC)/dq2 = (200 - q1 - 2q2)/2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the equilibrium quantities:\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n\nq2 = 200 - 4q1\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n(200 - q1 - 2(200 - 4q1))/2 = 0\n(200 - q1 - 400 + 8q1) = 0\n7q1 - 200 = 0\nq1 = 200/7 ≈ 28.57\n\nNow, substitute q1 back into the equation for q2:\n\nq2 = 200 - 4(200/7)\nq2 = 200 - 800/7\nq2 = 600/7 ≈ 85.71\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium quantities, we can find the equilibrium price using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = (200 - (q1 + q2)) / 2\nP = (200 - (28.57 + 85.71)) / 2\nP = (200 - 114.28) / 2\nP ≈ 42.86\n\nSo, XYZ Ltd. will produce approximately 28.57 units and charge a price of $42.86, while ABC Corp. will produce approximately 85.71 units and also charge a price of $42.86 to maximize their profits in a Stackelberg competition."
