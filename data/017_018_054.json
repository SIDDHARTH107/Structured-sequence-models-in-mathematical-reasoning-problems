Cyclic group C32:\nThe cyclic group of order 32 is generated by a single element of order 32. It has a unique isomorphism class, which we can denote as C32.\n\n2. Dihedral group D16:\nThe dihedral group D16 has order 2 * 16 = 32. However, it is not a valid option in this case, because the dihedral group of order 32 is D32, not D16.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 32:\nThere are six non-abelian groups of order 32, which can be described using the following presentations:\n\na) QD32: The generalized quaternion group of order 32, with presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2, b^−1ab = a^9⟩.\n\nb) SD32: The semi-dihedral group of order 32, with presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2, b^−1ab = a^15⟩.\n\nc) M32: The modular group of order 32, with presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4, b^−1ab = a^3⟩.\n\nd) D4 x C4: The direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 4, with presentation ⟨a, b, c | a^4 = b^2 = c^4, ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb^−1⟩.\n\ne) Q8 x C4: The direct product of the quaternion group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 4, with presentation ⟨a, b, c | a^4 = b^2 = c^4, ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb⟩.\n\nf) C2 x C2 x C2 x C2 x C2: The direct product of five cyclic groups of order 2, with presentation ⟨a, b, c, d, e | a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = e^2, ab = ba, ac = ca, ad = da, ae = ea, bc = cb, bd = db, be = eb, cd = dc, ce = ec, de = ed⟩.\n\nIn summary, there are 7 isomorphism classes for groups of order 32: C32, QD32, SD32, M32, D4 x C4, Q8 x C4, and C2 x C2 x C2 x C2 x C2."
