    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n4x^3 - 12x^2 = 4x^2(x - 3)\n\nDenominator:\n8x^2 - 16x = 8x(x - 2)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(4x^2(x - 3)) / (8x(x - 2))\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 4x^2 and 8x is 4x.\n\n(4x^2(x - 3)) / (8x(x - 2)) = (4x(x - 3)) / (8(x - 2))\n\nNow, divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4x:\n\n(4x(x - 3)) / (8(x - 2)) = (x - 3) / (2(x - 2))\n\nThe simplified rational expression is:\n\n(x - 3) / (2(x - 2))"
