    "message_2": "To determine the behavior of $u(x,y,t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$, we can analyze the different components of the given solution:\n\n$u(x,y,t) = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^{3/2}} e^{-(x^2+y^2)/(4t)} \\cos\\left(\\frac{x^2+y^2}{4t} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$\n\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, we have:\n\n1. $\\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^{3/2}} \\to 0$: The prefactor goes to zero as $t$ increases, since the exponent of $t$ in the denominator is positive.\n\n2. $e^{-(x^2+y^2)/(4t)} \\to 1$: The exponential term approaches 1 as $t$ increases, since the exponent approaches 0.\n\n3. $\\cos\\left(\\frac{x^2+y^2}{4t} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\to \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$: The cosine term approaches a constant value as the argument approaches $-\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nTaking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$, we have:\n\n$u(x,y,t) \\to \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^{3/2}} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 0$\n\nThus, as $t \\to \\infty$, the solution $u(x,y,t)$ approaches 0. This means that the heat dissipates over time, and the temperature converges to a constant value (in this case, 0) as time goes to infinity."
