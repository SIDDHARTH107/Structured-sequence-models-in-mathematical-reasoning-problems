    "message_1": "Suppose that on average, 5% of a certain type of product manufactured by a company is defective. If the company produces 10,000 units of this product, what is the probability that the number of defective units produced will be less than or equal to 500?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of units produced (10,000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective units (we want to find the probability for k ≤ 500)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (0.05 in this case)\n\nHowever, calculating the binomial probability for k ≤ 500 directly would be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, which is more manageable.\n\nThe normal approximation is given by:\n\nN(μ, σ^2)\n\nwhere:\n- μ = n * p (mean of the binomial distribution)\n- σ^2 = n * p * (1-p) (variance of the binomial distribution)\n\nIn this case, μ = 10,000 * 0.05 = 500 and σ^2 = 10,000 * 0.05 * 0.95 = 475. The standard deviation σ is the square root of the variance, so σ = √475 ≈ 21.79.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability P(X ≤ 500). To do this, we can use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the Z-table) to find the Z-score and the corresponding probability. The Z-score is calculated as:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nFor X = 500, Z = (500 - 500) / 21.79 = 0.\n\nLooking up a Z-score of 0 in the standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability P(Z ≤ 0) is 0.5, or 50%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the number of defective units produced will be less than or equal to 500 is approximately 50%."
