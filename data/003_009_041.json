    "message_1": "A triangle has two angles measuring 30 degrees and 60 degrees. The length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle is 10 cm. What is the perimeter of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "Since the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, the third angle must be 180 - (30 + 60) = 90 degrees. This means we have a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the side lengths is 1 : √3 : 2. The side opposite the 60-degree angle is the middle length, so we can set up the proportion:\n\n10 cm / √3 = x / 1\n\nTo find the side length opposite the 30-degree angle (x), we can multiply both sides by √3:\n\nx = 10√3 / 3 cm\n\nNow, to find the side length opposite the 90-degree angle (the hypotenuse), we can use the proportion:\n\n10 cm / 2 = y / 1\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 20 cm\n\nNow that we have all three side lengths, we can find the perimeter by adding them together:\n\nPerimeter = x + 10 cm + y = (10√3 / 3 cm) + 10 cm + 20 cm = 10√3 / 3 cm + 30 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is (10√3 / 3 cm) + 30 cm."
