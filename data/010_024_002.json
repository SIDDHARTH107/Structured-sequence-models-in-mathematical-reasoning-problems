    "message_2": "In a hyperbolic plane, the circumference of a circle with a radius r can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC = 2π * sinh(r)\n\nwhere sinh(r) is the hyperbolic sine function.\n\nGiven that the radius r = 4, we can find the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2π * sinh(4)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that sinh(4) ≈ 27.28992.\n\nTherefore, the circumference of the circle is:\n\nC ≈ 2π * 27.28992 ≈ 171.88734\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle with a radius of 4 in this hyperbolic plane is approximately 171.89 units."
