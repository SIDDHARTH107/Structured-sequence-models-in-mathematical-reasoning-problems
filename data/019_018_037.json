    "message_2": "To prove that there is no largest prime number, we can use a proof by contradiction. Let's assume that there is a largest prime number, and we'll call it P. Now, let's consider the number Q, which is the product of all prime numbers up to P, and then add 1 to it. So, Q = (2 * 3 * 5 * ... * P) + 1.\n\nNow, let's examine the properties of Q. Since Q is one greater than the product of all prime numbers up to P, it is not divisible by any of those prime numbers. If it were divisible by any of them, there would be a remainder of 1 when divided by that prime number.\n\nNow, we have two possibilities for Q:\n\n1. Q is a prime number itself. In this case, Q is a prime number larger than P, which contradicts our assumption that P is the largest prime number.\n\n2. Q is a composite number. If Q is composite, it must have a prime factor. However, we have already established that Q is not divisible by any prime numbers up to P. Therefore, Q must have a prime factor greater than P. Again, this contradicts our assumption that P is the largest prime number.\n\nIn both cases, we have reached a contradiction, which means our original assumption that there is a largest prime number must be false. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no largest prime number."
