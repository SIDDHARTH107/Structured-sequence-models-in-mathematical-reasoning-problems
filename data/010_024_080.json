    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a hyperbolic triangle is determined by its angles, not its side lengths. The area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, the angles are 60, 70, and 50 degrees. First, we need to convert these angles to radians:\n\n60 degrees = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n70 degrees = 70 * (π / 180) = 7π / 18 radians\n50 degrees = 50 * (π / 180) = 5π / 18 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = π - (π / 3 + 7π / 18 + 5π / 18)\nArea = π - (6π / 18 + 7π / 18 + 5π / 18)\nArea = π - (18π / 18)\nArea = π - π\nArea = 0\n\nHowever, this result is not correct for a hyperbolic triangle. The sum of the angles in a hyperbolic triangle is always less than π (180 degrees). In this case, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees, which corresponds to a Euclidean triangle, not a hyperbolic triangle. Therefore, the problem statement is incorrect, and it is not possible to find the area of a hyperbolic triangle with the given angles."
