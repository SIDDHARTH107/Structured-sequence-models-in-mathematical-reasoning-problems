    "message_2": "Yes, I can decrypt the message using the Rail Fence Cipher with a rail height of 3.\n\nThe encrypted message is \"HORL WLEL ODL\". To decrypt it, we will arrange the characters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . . L\n. W . L . E . L . O . D\n. . . L . . . W . . . .\n\nNow, read the characters in the zigzag pattern from left to right and top to bottom:\n\nH -> E -> L -> L -> O -> W -> O -> R -> L -> D -> L\n\nThe decrypted message is \"HELLO WORLD\"."
