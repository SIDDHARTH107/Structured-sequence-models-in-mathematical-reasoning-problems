    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\n(1) 6x + 4iy = 8 + 6i\n(2) 6x + 15y = 3 - 6i\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate x:\n\n(1) - (2): (6x + 4iy) - (6x + 15y) = (8 + 6i) - (3 - 6i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-11y + 4iy = 5 + 12i\n\nNow, let's factor out y from the left side:\n\ny(-11 + 4i) = 5 + 12i\n\nTo solve for y, we will divide both sides by -11 + 4i. To do this, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of -11 + 4i, which is -11 - 4i:\n\ny = (5 + 12i) * (-11 - 4i) / ((-11 + 4i) * (-11 - 4i))\n\ny = (-55 - 20i - 132i - 48i^2) / (121 + 44i - 44i - 16i^2)\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can simplify the expression:\n\ny = (-55 - 20i - 132i + 48) / (121 + 16)\n\ny = (-7 - 152i) / 137\n\nNow we have the value of y:\n\ny = -7/137 - 152i/137\n\nNext, we will substitute the value of y back into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation:\n\n3x + 2i(-7/137 - 152i/137) = 4 + 3i\n\n3x - 14i/137 - 304i^2/137 = 4 + 3i\n\n3x + 14i/137 + 304/137 = 4 + 3i\n\nNow, let's isolate x:\n\n3x = (4 - 304/137) + (3i - 14i/137)\n\n3x = -168/137 + 289i/137\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = (-168/137) / 3 + (289i/137) / 3\n\nx = -56/137 + 289i/411\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = -56/137 + 289i/411\ny = -7/137 - 152i/137"
