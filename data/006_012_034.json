    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, the probability of a car theft occurring on Monday is 0.05, on Tuesday it's 0.03, on Wednesday it's 0.02, on Thursday it's 0.04, and on Friday it's 0.06. What is the probability of a car theft occurring at least once during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) in this neighborhood?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a car theft occurring at least once during the weekdays, we can first find the probability of no car thefts occurring during the weekdays and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no car theft occurring on each day is:\nMonday: 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\nTuesday: 1 - 0.03 = 0.97\nWednesday: 1 - 0.02 = 0.98\nThursday: 1 - 0.04 = 0.96\nFriday: 1 - 0.06 = 0.94\n\nNow, we find the probability of no car thefts occurring during the entire week by multiplying the probabilities of no car thefts on each day:\n0.95 * 0.97 * 0.98 * 0.96 * 0.94 ≈ 0.8403\n\nFinally, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one car theft occurring during the weekdays:\n1 - 0.8403 ≈ 0.1597\n\nSo, the probability of a car theft occurring at least once during the weekdays in this neighborhood is approximately 0.1597 or 15.97%."
