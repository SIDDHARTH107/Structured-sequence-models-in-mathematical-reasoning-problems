    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G, we first need to identify the structure of the graph. Since there are 5 vertices and 7 edges, and each vertex has degree 2 except for two vertices which have degree 3, we can deduce that the graph is a cycle with an additional edge connecting the two vertices of degree 3.\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E. The graph can be represented as follows:\n\nA -- B -- C -- D -- E -- A\n       |\n       +---- B\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) using the recursive deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y)\n\nwhere G-e is the graph obtained by deleting an edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nLet's choose the additional edge B-B as the edge e. When we delete this edge, we get a simple cycle with 5 vertices (C5). When we contract this edge, we get a cycle with 4 vertices (C4).\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for a cycle of length n is given by:\n\nT_{C_n}(x, y) = (x-1)^{n-1} + (y-1)^{n-1}\n\nSo, we have:\n\nT_{C5}(x, y) = (x-1)^4 + (y-1)^4\nT_{C4}(x, y) = (x-1)^3 + (y-1)^3\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomial of G using the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{C5}(x, y) + T_{C4}(x, y)\n          = ((x-1)^4 + (y-1)^4) + ((x-1)^3 + (y-1)^3)\n          = (x-1)^4 + (y-1)^4 + (x-1)^3 + (y-1)^3\n\nThis is the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G."
