    "message_1": "A fluid has a velocity profile given by $u(y,t) = U\\sin(\\omega t)e^{-\\alpha y}$, where $y$ is the vertical coordinate, $t$ is time, $U$ is the maximum velocity, $\\omega$ is the frequency of oscillation, and $\\alpha$ is the damping constant. What is the Fourier transform of the velocity profile with respect to $y$? And what is the cutoff wavelength below which the fluid motion is heavily damped?",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the velocity profile with respect to $y$, we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{u(y,t)\\}(k,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(y,t)e^{-iky} dy$$\n\nHere, $k$ is the wavenumber, which is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ by $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$. We will now compute the Fourier transform of $u(y,t)$:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{u(y,t)\\}(k,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} U\\sin(\\omega t)e^{-\\alpha y}e^{-iky} dy$$\n\nSince the integral is with respect to $y$, we can treat $U\\sin(\\omega t)$ as a constant:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{u(y,t)\\}(k,t) = U\\sin(\\omega t) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\alpha + ik)y} dy$$\n\nThis integral is a simple exponential integral, which can be solved using integration by parts or by recognizing it as a Laplace transform. The result is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{u(y,t)\\}(k,t) = U\\sin(\\omega t) \\frac{1}{\\alpha + ik}$$\n\nNow, let's find the cutoff wavelength below which the fluid motion is heavily damped. The damping is determined by the exponential term $e^{-\\alpha y}$ in the velocity profile. A larger value of $\\alpha$ corresponds to more damping. We can relate $\\alpha$ to the wavelength $\\lambda$ using the wavenumber $k$:\n\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$$\n\nFor heavy damping, we want the exponential term to decay significantly over a distance of one wavelength. A common criterion for this is that the amplitude of the oscillation should be reduced to $1/e$ (about 37%) of its initial value over one wavelength:\n\n$$e^{-\\alpha \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{e}$$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n$$-\\alpha \\lambda = -1$$\n\nNow, we can solve for the cutoff wavelength $\\lambda_c$:\n\n$$\\lambda_c = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_c}}$$\n\n$$\\lambda_c^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$$\n\n$$\\lambda_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}}$$\n\nSo, the cutoff wavelength below which the fluid motion is heavily damped is $\\lambda_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}}$."
