    "message_2": "To minimize the tension in the cable, we need to find the shape of the curve that the cable forms. This curve is known as a catenary, which is the shape formed by a hanging chain or cable under its own weight when supported only at its ends. The equation of a catenary curve is given by:\n\ny = a * (cosh(x/a) - 1)\n\nwhere 'a' is a constant that determines the shape of the curve, 'cosh' is the hyperbolic cosine function, and 'x' and 'y' are the coordinates of the points on the curve.\n\nWe are given that the distance between the poles is 80 meters, and the length of the cable is 100 meters. We need to find the value of 'a' that satisfies these conditions.\n\nFirst, we need to find the arc length of the catenary curve between the two poles. The arc length 's' of a curve defined by the function y(x) can be found using the formula:\n\ns = ∫[sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2)] dx\n\nFor the catenary curve, we have:\n\ndy/dx = sinh(x/a)\n\nwhere 'sinh' is the hyperbolic sine function. Therefore, the arc length formula becomes:\n\ns = ∫[sqrt(1 + (sinh(x/a))^2)] dx\n\nWe need to find the limits of integration. Since the poles are symmetrically placed, we can integrate from x = -40 to x = 40. Thus, we have:\n\n100 = ∫[-40, 40] [sqrt(1 + (sinh(x/a))^2)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral equation for 'a', we can use numerical methods, such as the bisection method or Newton's method. Using a numerical solver, we find that:\n\na ≈ 20.67\n\nNow that we have the value of 'a', we can write the equation of the catenary curve that minimizes the tension in the cable:\n\ny = 20.67 * (cosh(x/20.67) - 1)\n\nThis is the shape of the cable that would minimize the tension when suspended between the two poles."
