    "message_2": "To find the probability that a person with a specific disease will survive for at least 3 years, we need to evaluate the survival function S(t) at t = 3.\n\nS(3) = e^(-0.05 * 3)\n\nS(3) = e^(-0.15)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of e^(-0.15).\n\nS(3) â‰ˆ 0.8607\n\nSo, the probability that a person with the specific disease will survive for at least 3 years is approximately 0.8607 or 86.07%."
