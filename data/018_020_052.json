    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nA ∩ B = {} (since A and B have no common elements)\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the sets {4, 6, 10} and {1, 3, 5}:\n\n{4, 6, 10} ∪ {1, 3, 5} = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10}\n\nTo show that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the union of these two sets, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ ({4, 6, 10} ∪ {1, 3, 5}) = (A ∩ ({4, 6, 10} ∪ {1, 3, 5})) ∆ (B ∩ ({4, 6, 10} ∪ {1, 3, 5}))\n\nLet's find the intersection and symmetric difference for the left side of the equation:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ ({4, 6, 10} ∪ {1, 3, 5}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ∩ {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10} = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the intersections and symmetric difference for the right side of the equation:\n\nA ∩ ({4, 6, 10} ∪ {1, 3, 5}) = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} ∩ {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10} = {4, 6, 10}\nB ∩ ({4, 6, 10} ∪ {1, 3, 5}) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} ∩ {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of these two sets:\n\n{4, 6, 10} ∆ {1, 3, 5} = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10}\n\nSince the left side and the right side of the equation are equal, we have shown that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the union of the sets {4, 6, 10} and {1, 3, 5}."
