    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of sets A and B, which is denoted as A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A ∩ B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\n(A ∩ B) × (A ∩ B) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's verify that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection. To do this, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∩ B) × (A ∩ B) = (A × B) ∩ (A × B)\n\nWe already found (A ∩ B) × (A ∩ B) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}.\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∩ (A × B). Since (A × B) is the set of all ordered pairs from A and B, the intersection of (A × B) with itself is just (A × B).\n\n(A × B) ∩ (A × B) = A × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets:\n\n(A ∩ B) × (A ∩ B) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\n(A × B) ∩ (A × B) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, so the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over intersection."
