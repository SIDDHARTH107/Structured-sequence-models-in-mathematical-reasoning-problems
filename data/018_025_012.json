Since (A∩B) and (B∩A) are the same set (the intersection of A and B), their symmetric difference will be an empty set.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of A and B:\n\nA∩B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A∩B) and (B∩A):\n\n(A∩B)Δ(B∩A) = {x: x ∈ (A∩B) or x ∈ (B∩A), but not both}\n\nSince (A∩B) and (B∩A) are the same set, there are no elements that are in one set but not the other. Therefore, the symmetric difference is an empty set:\n\n(A∩B)Δ(B∩A) = ∅"
