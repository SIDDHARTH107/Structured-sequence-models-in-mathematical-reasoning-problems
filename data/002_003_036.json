    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * side_length^2\n\nGiven the side length of the cube is 6 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (6 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 6 * 36 cm^2\nSurface Area = 216 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 216 square centimeters."
