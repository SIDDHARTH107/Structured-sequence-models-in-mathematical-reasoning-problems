    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem: \n\nA factory produces two products A and B. The profit per unit for product A is $10 and for product B is $15. The production capacity of product A is 10 units and for product B is 6 units. The factory has a total budget of $200. How many units of each product should be produced to maximize the profit?  Use nonlinear programming to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using nonlinear programming, we first need to set up the objective function and constraints.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized):\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production capacity constraint: x ≤ 10 and y ≤ 6\n2. Budget constraint: The cost of producing x units of A and y units of B should not exceed $200. Let's assume the cost of producing one unit of A is c1 and one unit of B is c2. So, c1x + c2y ≤ 200. We don't have the values of c1 and c2, so we cannot solve this constraint.\n\nSince we don't have enough information about the cost of production, we cannot solve this problem completely. However, we can still analyze the objective function and constraints given.\n\nIf there were no constraints, the factory should produce as many units of product B as possible since it has a higher profit per unit. But due to the production capacity constraint, the maximum number of units of product B that can be produced is 6.\n\nIf the factory produces only product B, the profit would be P(0, 6) = 10(0) + 15(6) = $90.\n\nNow, let's consider producing both products A and B. Since we don't have the cost constraint, we can only analyze the production capacity constraint. If the factory produces 10 units of A and 6 units of B, the profit would be P(10, 6) = 10(10) + 15(6) = $190.\n\nWithout the cost constraint, the factory should produce 10 units of product A and 6 units of product B to maximize the profit, which would be $190. However, to completely solve this problem, we need the cost of production for each product."
