    "message_2": "To write the equation for the sine function with an amplitude of 8 and a period of 6π, we need to determine the values of A and B in the general sine function equation:\n\ny = A * sin(Bx)\n\nHere, A represents the amplitude and B determines the period of the function. The period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nWe are given the amplitude A = 8 and the period = 6π. We can find the value of B using the period formula:\n\n6π = 2π / B\nB = 2π / 6π = 1/3\n\nNow we can write the equation for the sine function:\n\ny = 8 * sin((1/3)x)"
