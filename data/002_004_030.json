    "message_1": "A rectangle has a length of 10 centimeters and a width of 5 centimeters. What is the perimeter of the rectangle in centimeters?",
    "message_2": "The perimeter of a rectangle can be found using the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 10 centimeters and the width (W) is 5 centimeters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(10 + 5)\nP = 2(15)\nP = 30\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 30 centimeters."
