    "message_2": "To find all non-abelian groups of order 96, we first analyze the prime factorization of 96. We have 96 = 2^5 * 3. Now, we use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's third theorem, n_2 must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_2 = 3, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By Sylow's third theorem, n_3 must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_3 = 4 or 16, there are multiple Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and analyze their structures.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 32 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Both P_2 and P_3 are normal in the group G. By the direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 is abelian and P_3 is abelian, their direct product is also abelian. Thus, this case does not yield a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4 or 16\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 32 and multiple Sylow 3-subgroups. P_2 is normal in G, but none of the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal. We can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups in this case. The action of a Sylow 3-subgroup on P_2 determines the structure of the semidirect product. Since P_2 is of order 32, it can be isomorphic to either C32, C16 × C2, C8 × C4, C8 × C2 × C2, or C4 × C4 × C2. We can analyze each possibility and find the non-isomorphic semidirect products. In total, we find 24 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. P_3 is normal in G, but none of the Sylow 2-subgroups are normal. Similar to Case 2, we can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups in this case. The action of a Sylow 2-subgroup on P_3 determines the structure of the semidirect product. In total, we find 48 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4 or 16\nIn this case, there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups and multiple Sylow 3-subgroups. None of the Sylow subgroups are normal. We can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups in this case. The action of a Sylow 3-subgroup on a Sylow 2-subgroup determines the structure of the semidirect product. In total, we find 124 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn summary, we have found 24 + 48 + 124 = 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. None of these groups are isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, as all of them are non-abelian, while C96 is abelian. Furthermore, none of these groups are isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, as the order of A4 × C4 × C2 is 4! * 4 * 2 = 192, which is different from 96."
