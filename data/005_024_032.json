    "message_2": "To find the mean, median, and mode of the data, we will first organize the data in ascending order: 25, 28, 30, 32.\n\nMean:\nThe mean is the average of the data. To find the mean, we will add up all the numbers and then divide by the total number of data points.\n\nMean = (25 + 28 + 30 + 32) / 4\nMean = 115 / 4\nMean = 28.75\n\nMedian:\nThe median is the middle value of the data. Since we have an even number of data points, we will find the average of the two middle values.\n\nMedian = (28 + 30) / 2\nMedian = 58 / 2\nMedian = 29\n\nMode:\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in the data. In this case, there is no number that appears more than once, so there is no mode.\n\nSo, the mean is 28.75, the median is 29, and there is no mode."
