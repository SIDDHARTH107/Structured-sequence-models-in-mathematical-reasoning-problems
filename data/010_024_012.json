    "message_2": "In a hyperbolic plane, the area of a circle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = 4π (sinh²(r/2))\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the curvature is -1. Since the curvature in this problem is -4, we need to adjust the radius accordingly. We can do this by dividing the radius by the square root of the absolute value of the curvature:\n\nAdjusted radius = r / sqrt(|curvature|) = 5 / sqrt(4) = 5 / 2\n\nNow we can plug the adjusted radius into the formula:\n\nArea = 4π (sinh²(5/4))\nArea ≈ 4π (sinh²(1.25))\nArea ≈ 4π (1.17897)\nArea ≈ 14.8044 square units\n\nSo, the area of the circle in this hyperbolic plane with a radius of 5 units and a curvature of -4 is approximately 14.8044 square units."
