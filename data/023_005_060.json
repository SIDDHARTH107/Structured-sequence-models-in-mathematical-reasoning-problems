    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial and boundary conditions, we will first apply the Fourier sine transform to the PDE. The Fourier sine transform of a function $f(x)$ is defined as:\n\n$F_s\\{f(x)\\}(k) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\int_0^\\pi f(x) \\sin(kx) dx$\n\nApplying the Fourier sine transform to the PDE, we get:\n\n$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}F_s\\{u(x,t)\\}(k) - 4\\frac{d}{dt}F_s\\{u(x,t)\\}(k) = 0$\n\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. Let $U(k,t) = F_s\\{u(x,t)\\}(k)$. The ODE becomes:\n\n$\\frac{d^2U}{dt^2} - 4\\frac{dU}{dt} = 0$\n\nThe characteristic equation for this ODE is:\n\n$r^2 - 4r = 0$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get $r = 0, 4$. Thus, the general solution for $U(k,t)$ is:\n\n$U(k,t) = A(k) + B(k)e^{4t}$\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions. First, we have $u(x,0) = \\cos(x)$. Taking the Fourier sine transform of this initial condition, we get:\n\n$U(k,0) = A(k) = F_s\\{\\cos(x)\\}(k)$\n\nTo find $F_s\\{\\cos(x)\\}(k)$, we compute the integral:\n\n$F_s\\{\\cos(x)\\}(k) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\int_0^\\pi \\cos(x) \\sin(kx) dx$\n\nThis integral evaluates to:\n\n$F_s\\{\\cos(x)\\}(k) = \\begin{cases}\n0, & k = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{2(-1)^{(k+1)/2}}{k^2 - 1}, & k = 2, 3, 4, \\dots\n\\end{cases}$\n\nNext, we have $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$. Taking the Fourier sine transform of this initial condition, we get:\n\n$\\frac{dU}{dt}(k,0) = 4B(k) = F_s\\{0\\}(k)$\n\nSince the Fourier sine transform of 0 is 0, we have:\n\n$B(k) = 0$\n\nNow, we have found $A(k)$ and $B(k)$, so we can write the solution $U(k,t)$ as:\n\n$U(k,t) = A(k) = \\begin{cases}\n0, & k = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{2(-1)^{(k+1)/2}}{k^2 - 1}, & k = 2, 3, 4, \\dots\n\\end{cases}$\n\nFinally, we need to apply the inverse Fourier sine transform to find the solution $u(x,t)$:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty U(k,t) \\sin(kx)$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $U(k,t)$, we get:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{k=2}^\\infty \\frac{2(-1)^{(k+1)/2}}{k^2 - 1} \\sin(kx)$\n\nThis is the solution to the given PDE with the specified initial and boundary conditions."
