    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of vector V along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve at each point. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the position vector with respect to the parameter t:\n\nx'(t) = -2sin(t)\ny'(t) = 3cos(t)\n\nT(t) = (-2sin(t), 3cos(t))\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of V along the curve. This means that the transported vector V_t should always be parallel to the tangent vector T(t) at each point. To ensure this, we can use the Gram-Schmidt process to project V onto the tangent vector T(t) at each point.\n\nLet's find the tangent vector T(0) and T(pi/3):\n\nT(0) = (-2sin(0), 3cos(0)) = (0, 3)\nT(pi/3) = (-2sin(pi/3), 3cos(pi/3)) = (-sqrt(3), 3/2)\n\nNow, we project V onto T(0) and T(pi/3):\n\nV_proj_T0 = (V · T(0)) / ||T(0)||^2 * T(0) = (4*0 + 2*3) / (0^2 + 3^2) * (0, 3) = (0, 2)\n\nV_proj_Tpi3 = (V · T(pi/3)) / ||T(pi/3)||^2 * T(pi/3) = (4*(-sqrt(3)) + 2*(3/2)) / ((-sqrt(3))^2 + (3/2)^2) * (-sqrt(3), 3/2) ≈ (-1.732, 1.732)\n\nSo, the parallel transport of vector V along the curve from t = 0 to t = pi/3 is approximately:\n\nV_t = (-1.732, 1.732)"
