    "message_2": "To find the estimate for f'(1.3) and f''(1.3) using the forward difference method, we will first calculate the forward differences for f(x) and then use these to approximate the derivatives at x = 1.3.\n\nStep 1: Calculate f(x) at x = 1.3 and x = 1.4 (using step size of 0.1)\nf(1.3) = (1.3)^2 + 2(1.3) + 1 = 1.69 + 2.6 + 1 = 5.29\nf(1.4) = (1.4)^2 + 2(1.4) + 1 = 1.96 + 2.8 + 1 = 5.76\n\nStep 2: Calculate the first forward difference Δf(x) at x = 1.3\nΔf(x) = f(x + 0.1) - f(x)\nΔf(1.3) = f(1.4) - f(1.3) = 5.76 - 5.29 = 0.47\n\nStep 3: Approximate f'(1.3) using the first forward difference\nf'(1.3) ≈ Δf(1.3) / 0.1 = 0.47 / 0.1 = 4.7\n\nStep 4: Calculate f(x) at x = 1.5\nf(1.5) = (1.5)^2 + 2(1.5) + 1 = 2.25 + 3 + 1 = 6.25\n\nStep 5: Calculate the second forward difference Δ²f(x) at x = 1.3\nΔ²f(x) = Δf(x + 0.1) - Δf(x)\nΔ²f(1.3) = [f(1.5) - f(1.4)] - [f(1.4) - f(1.3)] = (6.25 - 5.76) - (5.76 - 5.29) = 0.49 - 0.47 = 0.02\n\nStep 6: Approximate f''(1.3) using the second forward difference\nf''(1.3) ≈ Δ²f(1.3) / (0.1)^2 = 0.02 / 0.01 = 2\n\nSo, the estimate for f'(1.3) is 4.7 and the estimate for f''(1.3) is 2."
