    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $4^3 \\cdot 4^4$, we can use the property of exponents that states when multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base, we can add the exponents: $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$.\n\nIn this case, our base is 4 and the exponents are 3 and 4. So, we can add the exponents:\n\n$4^3 \\cdot 4^4 = 4^{3+4} = 4^7$\n\nThe simplified exponential expression is $4^7$."
