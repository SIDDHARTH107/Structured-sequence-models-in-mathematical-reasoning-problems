    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 3x + 4y = 25, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 4, and then find a particular solution for x and y. After that, we can find the general solution for all integer values of x and y.\n\n1. Find the GCD of 3 and 4 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n4 = 1 * 3 + 1\n3 = 1 * 1\n\nThe GCD of 3 and 4 is 1.\n\n2. Express the GCD as a linear combination of 3 and 4:\n\n1 = 4 - 1 * 3\n\n3. Multiply both sides of the equation by 25:\n\n25 = 25 * (4 - 1 * 3)\n\n4. Distribute the 25:\n\n25 = 100 - 75\n\n5. Rewrite the equation in the form 3x + 4y = 25:\n\n3 * (-25) + 4 * 25 = 25\n\nSo, a particular solution is x = -25 and y = 25.\n\n6. Find the general solution:\n\nSince the GCD of 3 and 4 is 1, the general solution can be found by adding integer multiples of 4 to x and subtracting the same integer multiples from y:\n\nx = -25 + 4t\ny = 25 - 3t\n\nwhere t is an integer.\n\nThus, the general solution for the Diophantine equation 3x + 4y = 25 is x = -25 + 4t and y = 25 - 3t, where t is an integer."
