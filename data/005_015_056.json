They have collected data on the amount spent by each customer in the past six months. Here are the purchases in dollars made by each customer: \n\nCustomer 1: $40, $50, $30, $45, $55, $60  \nCustomer 2: $20, $25, $30, $35, $40, $45  \nCustomer 3: $80, $90, $75, $70, $85, $100  \n\nUsing k-means clustering with k = 2, determine the customer groups and calculate the centroids of the clusters.",
    "message_2": "To perform k-means clustering, we first need to calculate the average purchase amount for each customer:\n\nCustomer 1: (40 + 50 + 30 + 45 + 55 + 60) / 6 = 280 / 6 = $46.67\nCustomer 2: (20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45) / 6 = 195 / 6 = $32.50\nCustomer 3: (80 + 90 + 75 + 70 + 85 + 100) / 6 = 500 / 6 = $83.33\n\nNow, we need to initialize the centroids. We can use the first two customers' averages as the initial centroids:\n\nCentroid 1: $46.67\nCentroid 2: $32.50\n\nNext, we assign each customer to the nearest centroid:\n\nCustomer 1: Centroid 1 (distance = |46.67 - 46.67| = 0)\nCustomer 2: Centroid 2 (distance = |32.50 - 32.50| = 0)\nCustomer 3: Centroid 1 (distance = |83.33 - 46.67| = 36.66)\n\nNow, we update the centroids by calculating the average of the customers assigned to each centroid:\n\nCentroid 1: (46.67 + 83.33) / 2 = 130 / 2 = $65.00\nCentroid 2: $32.50 (only one customer assigned)\n\nWe repeat the process of assigning customers to the nearest centroid:\n\nCustomer 1: Centroid 1 (distance = |46.67 - 65.00| = 18.33)\nCustomer 2: Centroid 2 (distance = |32.50 - 32.50| = 0)\nCustomer 3: Centroid 1 (distance = |83.33 - 65.00| = 18.33)\n\nNo changes in the customer assignments, so the algorithm has converged.\n\nThe final customer groups and centroids are:\n\nCluster 1 (Centroid 1: $65.00): Customer 1 and Customer 3\nCluster 2 (Centroid 2: $32.50): Customer 2"
