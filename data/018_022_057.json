    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nSimilarly, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 3, 1} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A Δ B) × (B Δ A) = {1, 3} × {1, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of (B Δ A) and (A Δ B).\n\n(B Δ A) × (A Δ B) = {1, 3} × {1, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that:\n\n(A Δ B) × (B Δ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n(B Δ A) × (A Δ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nSince both Cartesian products have the same elements, they are equal:\n\n(A Δ B) × (B Δ A) = (B Δ A) × (A Δ B)"
