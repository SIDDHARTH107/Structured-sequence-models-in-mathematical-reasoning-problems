Determine the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen and included in an independent set of this graph.",
    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum number of vertices that can be included in an independent set, we can use a greedy algorithm.\n\n1. Start with an empty set and sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).\n2. Add the vertex with the lowest degree to the independent set.\n3. Remove the chosen vertex and its adjacent vertices from the graph.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until there are no more vertices left in the graph.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. Degrees of vertices: {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 4, 6: 4, 7: 4, 8: 2, 9: 3}\n2. Add vertex 8 to the independent set (lowest degree).\n3. Remove vertex 8 and its adjacent vertices (7 and 9) from the graph.\n4. Degrees of remaining vertices: {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 3, 5: 3, 6: 3}\n5. Add vertex 1 to the independent set (lowest degree among remaining vertices).\n6. Remove vertex 1 and its adjacent vertices (2, 3, and 6) from the graph.\n7. Degrees of remaining vertices: {4: 1, 5: 1}\n8. Add vertex 4 to the independent set (lowest degree among remaining vertices).\n9. Remove vertex 4 and its adjacent vertex (5) from the graph.\n\nNow there are no more vertices left in the graph. The independent set we found is {1, 4, 8}, which has 3 vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of vertices that can be included in an independent set of this graph is 3."
