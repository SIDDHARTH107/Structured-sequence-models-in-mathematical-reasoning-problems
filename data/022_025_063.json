    "message_2": "To find the second-order derivative of the wave function ψ(x) = 2x^3 - 3ix^2 + 4x - i, we will first find the first-order derivative and then the second-order derivative.\n\nFirst-order derivative:\nψ'(x) = d(2x^3 - 3ix^2 + 4x - i)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nψ'(x) = (6x^2 - 6ix + 4)\n\nNow, we will find the second-order derivative:\nψ''(x) = d(6x^2 - 6ix + 4)/dx\n\nAgain, using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nψ''(x) = (12x - 6i)\n\nSo, the second-order derivative of the wave function ψ(x) = 2x^3 - 3ix^2 + 4x - i is ψ''(x) = 12x - 6i."
