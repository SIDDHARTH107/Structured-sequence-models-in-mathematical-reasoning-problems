    "message_1": "Consider a multivariate data set consisting of three variables: X, Y, and Z. The correlation matrix among the variables is given below:\n```\n       X     Y     Z\nX   1.00  0.25 -0.50\nY   0.25  1.00  0.75\nZ  -0.50  0.75  1.00\n```\nIf the mean values of X, Y, and Z are 10, 20, and 30, respectively, and the standard deviations of X, Y, and Z are 2, 4, and 6, respectively, calculate the following:\n\na) The covariance matrix of X, Y, and Z.\nb) The expected value of (2X - 3Y + 4Z).\nc) The probability that X + Y + Z is greater than 70.",
    "message_2": "a) To calculate the covariance matrix, we use the formula: Cov(X, Y) = Corr(X, Y) * SD(X) * SD(Y). The covariance matrix will be:\n\n```\n       X     Y     Z\nX   1.00 * 2 * 2   0.25 * 2 * 4  -0.50 * 2 * 6\nY   0.25 * 4 * 2   1.00 * 4 * 4   0.75 * 4 * 6\nZ  -0.50 * 6 * 2   0.75 * 6 * 4   1.00 * 6 * 6\n```\n\nWhich results in:\n\n```\n       X     Y      Z\nX   4.00  2.00  -6.00\nY   2.00  16.00  18.00\nZ  -6.00  18.00  36.00\n```\n\nb) The expected value of (2X - 3Y + 4Z) can be calculated using the linearity of expectation: E(2X - 3Y + 4Z) = 2E(X) - 3E(Y) + 4E(Z) = 2(10) - 3(20) + 4(30) = 20 - 60 + 120 = 80.\n\nc) To calculate the probability that X + Y + Z is greater than 70, we first need to find the mean and variance of the sum X + Y + Z. \n\nMean of X + Y + Z = E(X) + E(Y) + E(Z) = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60.\n\nVariance of X + Y + Z = Var(X) + Var(Y) + Var(Z) + 2 * [Cov(X, Y) + Cov(X, Z) + Cov(Y, Z)] = 4 + 16 + 36 + 2 * (2 + (-6) + 18) = 56 + 2 * 14 = 84.\n\nStandard deviation of X + Y + Z = sqrt(84) ≈ 9.165.\n\nNow, we standardize the sum: (70 - 60) / 9.165 ≈ 1.091.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than 1.091 is approximately 0.862.\n\nSince we want the probability that X + Y + Z is greater than 70, we need to find the complement: 1 - 0.862 = 0.138.\n\nSo, the probability that X + Y + Z is greater than 70 is approximately 0.138 or 13.8%."
