    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, by the third Sylow theorem, the number of such subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. \n\nFor the Sylow 3-subgroups, the number of such subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 16.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since they are both normal, their direct product is a group of order 48. This gives us the group C_48 (cyclic group of order 48).\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. The unique Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the Sylow 3-subgroups are not. The unique Sylow 2-subgroup must be of order 16, which can be isomorphic to C_16 or C_8 × C_2. If it is isomorphic to C_16, we get the group C_16 × C_3. If it is isomorphic to C_8 × C_2, we get the group (C_8 × C_2) × C_3.\n\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1: In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The unique Sylow 3-subgroup is normal. The Sylow 2-subgroups must be of order 16, which can be isomorphic to C_16, C_8 × C_2, or C_4 × C_4. If it is isomorphic to C_16, we get the group C_16 : C_3 (semidirect product). If it is isomorphic to C_8 × C_2, we get the group (C_8 × C_2) : C_3. If it is isomorphic to C_4 × C_4, we get the group (C_4 × C_4) : C_3.\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4: In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. None of them are normal. This case does not result in any non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn summary, we have found 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. C_48\n2. C_16 × C_3\n3. (C_8 × C_2) × C_3\n4. C_16 : C_3\n5. (C_8 × C_2) : C_3\n6. (C_4 × C_4) : C_3"
