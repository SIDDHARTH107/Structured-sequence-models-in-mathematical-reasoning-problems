    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the minimum number of edges required for a connected graph with 10 vertices. This can be done using the formula for a tree: e = v - 1, where e is the number of edges and v is the number of vertices. In this case, e = 10 - 1 = 9.\n\n2. Since the graph G has 15 edges, which is 6 more than the minimum required for a connected graph with 10 vertices, there must be at least one cycle in the graph.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the shortest cycle. The shortest possible cycle in a graph is a triangle, which has 3 vertices and 3 edges. Let's check if such a cycle exists in the graph G.\n\n4. If there is a triangle in the graph, then at least one vertex must have a degree of 3 or more (i.e., it must be connected to at least three other vertices). The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 15 = 30.\n\n5. If all vertices have a degree of 2, then the sum of the degrees would be 2 * 10 = 20. Since the actual sum of the degrees is 30, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more, which means there is a triangle in the graph.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph G is 3, as the shortest cycle is a triangle with 3 vertices and 3 edges."
