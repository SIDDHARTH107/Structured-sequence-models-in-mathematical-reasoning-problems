    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nFor a sphere with a radius of 5 cm:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5³)\nV = (4/3)π(125)\nV = (500/3)π\n\nApproximating π as 3.14159:\n\nV ≈ (500/3) * 3.14159\nV ≈ 523.59833 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of a sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
