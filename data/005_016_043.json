    "message_1": "Suppose a high school has 60 students in a graduating class. The college admission department wants to determine if there is any difference in the mean math score between students who are accepted and those who are rejected. They collect data on 30 students who were accepted and 30 students who were rejected. The mean math score of the accepted students is 640 with a standard deviation of 50, and the mean math score of the rejected students is 590 with a standard deviation of 45. Use Discriminant Analysis to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean math scores between the accepted and rejected students at a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the mean math scores between the accepted and rejected students, we can perform a two-sample t-test. Discriminant analysis is not the appropriate method for this problem, as it is used for predicting group membership based on multiple continuous variables.\n\nHere are the steps to perform a two-sample t-test:\n\n1. State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1):\nH0: There is no significant difference in the mean math scores between the accepted and rejected students (μ1 = μ2).\nH1: There is a significant difference in the mean math scores between the accepted and rejected students (μ1 ≠ μ2).\n\n2. Calculate the pooled variance:\nPooled variance (s²) = [(n1 - 1) * s1² + (n2 - 1) * s2²] / (n1 + n2 - 2)\ns² = [(30 - 1) * 50² + (30 - 1) * 45²] / (30 + 30 - 2)\ns² = (29 * 2500 + 29 * 2025) / 58\ns² = 72500 / 58\ns² ≈ 1250\n\n3. Calculate the standard error (SE):\nSE = sqrt[(s² / n1) + (s² / n2)]\nSE = sqrt[(1250 / 30) + (1250 / 30)]\nSE = sqrt[83.33 + 83.33]\nSE ≈ 16.33\n\n4. Calculate the t-statistic:\nt = (M1 - M2) / SE\nt = (640 - 590) / 16.33\nt ≈ 3.06\n\n5. Determine the degrees of freedom (df):\ndf = n1 + n2 - 2\ndf = 30 + 30 - 2\ndf = 58\n\n6. Find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance:\nUsing a t-table or calculator, the critical t-value for df = 58 and α = 0.05 is approximately 2.002.\n\n7. Compare the calculated t-statistic to the critical t-value:\nSince the calculated t-statistic (3.06) is greater than the critical t-value (2.002), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is a significant difference in the mean math scores between the accepted and rejected students at a 5% level of significance."
