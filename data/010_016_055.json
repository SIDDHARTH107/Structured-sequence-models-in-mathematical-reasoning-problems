Let $[Y] \\in H_{n-k}(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ and $[Z] \\in H_{k}(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ be the homology classes of Y and Z, respectively.\n\n2.

By definition, the intersection number $[Y] \\cdot [Z]$ is given by\n$$[Y] \\cdot [Z] = \\langle [Y]^* \\smile [Z]^*, [X] \\rangle.$$\n\nSince the intersection is transverse, the intersection number $[Y] \\cdot [Z]$ is well-defined and is an integer."
