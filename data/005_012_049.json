    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum sample size needed for a given confidence level and margin of error, we can use the formula:\n\nn = (Z^2 * σ^2) / E^2\n\nwhere n is the sample size, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, σ is the population standard deviation, and E is the margin of error.\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table). The population standard deviation (σ) is given as 20, and the margin of error (E) is 5%.\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 20^2) / 5^2\nn = (3.8416 * 400) / 25\nn = 1536.64 / 25\nn = 61.4656\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a sample, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum sample size needed is 62."
