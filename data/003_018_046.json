    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 3sin(2x) - cos(3x), we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFirst, we'll find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [3sin(2x)] - d/dx [cos(3x)]\n\nFor the first term, the outer function is 3sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 3cos(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 2. Applying the chain rule:\n\nd/dx [3sin(2x)] = 3cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\nFor the second term, the outer function is -cos(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is sin(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 3. Applying the chain rule:\n\nd/dx [cos(3x)] = sin(3x) * 3 = 3sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can combine these derivatives:\n\nf'(x) = 6cos(2x) - 3sin(3x)\n\nNext, we'll evaluate the derivative at x = π/6:\n\nf'(π/6) = 6cos(2(π/6)) - 3sin(3(π/6))\nf'(π/6) = 6cos(π/3) - 3sin(π/2)\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2 and sin(π/2) = 1, so:\n\nf'(π/6) = 6(1/2) - 3(1)\nf'(π/6) = 3 - 3\nf'(π/6) = 0\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) = 3sin(2x) - cos(3x) at x = π/6 is 0."
