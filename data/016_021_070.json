    "message_2": "The fractal dimension (D) of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, N = 3 (as it is made up of 3 smaller copies of itself) and S = 2 (each smaller copy is half the size of the original).\n\nSo, the fractal dimension is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2) â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nThe fractal dimension remains the same after each iteration, so the fractal dimension after the 6th iteration is still approximately 1.5849625."
