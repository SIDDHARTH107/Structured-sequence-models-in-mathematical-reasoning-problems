    "message_1": "Suppose that the population mean for the weight of apples is 100 grams and the population standard deviation is 10 grams. A random sample of 25 apples is taken. What is the probability that the mean weight of the sample is less than 95 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the z-score formula for sample means. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation or a sample mean is from the population mean. The formula for the z-score of a sample mean is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\nμ = 100 grams (population mean)\nσ = 10 grams (population standard deviation)\nn = 25 (sample size)\nx̄ = 95 grams (the value we want to find the probability for)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the z-score formula:\n\nz = (95 - 100) / (10 / √25) = (-5) / (10 / 5) = -5 / 2 = -2.5\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 95 grams. The z-table gives the area to the left of a given z-score (which represents the probability of observing a value less than that z-score).\n\nLooking up the z-score of -2.5 in the z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.0062.\n\nSo, the probability that the mean weight of the sample is less than 95 grams is approximately 0.0062 or 0.62%."
