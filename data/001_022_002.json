    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial function f(x) = 2x^3 + x^2 - 5x - 6, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0.\n\nSo, we need to solve the equation:\n\n2x^3 + x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it is not easily factorable. We can use either synthetic division or numerical methods to find the roots. In this case, we will use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial with integer coefficients, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, -6) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 2).\n\nFactors of -6: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±1/2, ±3/2\n\nNow, we will test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial equation:\n\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 + (1)^2 - 5(1) - 6 = -8 (not a root)\nf(-1) = 2(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 - 5(-1) - 6 = 4 (not a root)\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 + (2)^2 - 5(2) - 6 = 14 (not a root)\nf(-2) = 2(-2)^3 + (-2)^2 - 5(-2) - 6 = 0 (a root)\nf(3) = 2(3)^3 + (3)^2 - 5(3) - 6 = 42 (not a root)\nf(-3) = 2(-3)^3 + (-3)^2 - 5(-3) - 6 = -18 (not a root)\nf(6) = 2(6)^3 + (6)^2 - 5(6) - 6 = 444 (not a root)\nf(-6) = 2(-6)^3 + (-6)^2 - 5(-6) - 6 = -444 (not a root)\nf(1/2) = 2(1/2)^3 + (1/2)^2 - 5(1/2) - 6 = -5.75 (not a root)\nf(-1/2) = 2(-1/2)^3 + (-1/2)^2 - 5(-1/2) - 6 = 0.25 (not a root)\nf(3/2) = 2(3/2)^3 + (3/2)^2 - 5(3/2) - 6 = 1.875 (not a root)\nf(-3/2) = 2(-3/2)^3 + (-3/2)^2 - 5(-3/2) - 6 = 0 (a root)\n\nWe found two rational roots: x = -2 and x = -3/2.\n\nNow, we can use synthetic division to find the remaining root:\n\nDivide the polynomial by (x + 2)(x + 3/2):\n\n2x^3 + x^2 - 5x - 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3/2)(2x - 2)\n\nThe remaining root is found by setting 2x - 2 = 0:\n\n2x - 2 = 0\n2x = 2\nx = 1\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the polynomial function f(x) = 2x^3 + x^2 - 5x - 6 are x = -2, x = -3/2, and x = 1."
