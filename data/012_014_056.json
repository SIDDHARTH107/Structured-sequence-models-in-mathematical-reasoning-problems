    "message_2": "To determine if G and H are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of G and H such that the adjacency between vertices is preserved.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the degree sequence of each graph. The degree sequence is a list of the degrees of the vertices in non-increasing order.\n\nDegree sequence of G:\nVertex 1: degree 2\nVertex 2: degree 3\nVertex 3: degree 2\nVertex 4: degree 3\n\nDegree sequence of G: 3, 3, 2, 2\n\nDegree sequence of H:\nVertex 1: degree 2\nVertex 2: degree 2\nVertex 3: degree 2\nVertex 4: degree 3\nVertex 5: degree 1\n\nDegree sequence of H: 3, 2, 2, 2, 1\n\nSince the degree sequences of G and H are not the same, the graphs G and H are not isomorphic."
