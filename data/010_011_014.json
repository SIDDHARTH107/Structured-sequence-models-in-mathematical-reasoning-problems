    "message_2": "The fundamental group of the two-dimensional torus is $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. We are looking for closed 2-manifolds with the same fundamental group.\n\nThe classification theorem for compact 2-manifolds states that every compact 2-manifold is either a sphere, a connected sum of tori, or a connected sum of projective planes. The sphere has a trivial fundamental group, and the projective plane has a fundamental group of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, so neither of these can have the same fundamental group as the torus.\n\nNow, let's consider the connected sum of tori. The connected sum of $n$ tori has a fundamental group of $\\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. For $n=1$, we have the torus itself with the fundamental group $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. For $n>1$, the fundamental group will be of higher rank, so these manifolds cannot have the same fundamental group as the torus.\n\nTherefore, there is only one non-homeomorphic two-dimensional closed manifold with the same fundamental group as the torus, which is the torus itself."
