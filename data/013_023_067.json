    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, Player 1 is given $10 and must decide how much of the money to send to Player 2. Whatever amount Player 1 sends is then tripled, and Player 2 must decide how much of the tripled amount to send back to Player 1. If Player 2 sends back the entire tripled amount, then the final payoff is $3 times the original amount sent by Player 1. However, if Player 2 sends back only a portion of the tripled amount, then the final payoff is reduced by that portion. \n\nIf Player 1 sends $4 to Player 2, what is the highest percentage of the tripled amount that Player 2 must send back to maximize the final payoff for both players?",
    "message_2": "If Player 1 sends $4 to Player 2, the amount triples to $12. To maximize the final payoff for both players, Player 2 should send back the entire tripled amount, which is $12.\n\nTo find the percentage of the tripled amount that Player 2 must send back, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (Amount sent back / Tripled amount) * 100\n\nPercentage = (12 / 12) * 100 = 100%\n\nSo, Player 2 must send back 100% of the tripled amount to maximize the final payoff for both players."
