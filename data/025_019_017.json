    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the Fano variety $X$ obtained as the blowup of $V_5$ at a general point, we will use the following formula for the degree of a blowup:\n\nDegree$(X) = \\text{Degree}(V_5) \\cdot \\text{Degree}(E)$,\n\nwhere $E$ is the exceptional divisor of the blowup.\n\nFirst, let's compute the degree of $V_5$. The degree of a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ is simply $d$. In this case, $V_5$ is defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $5$, so Degree$(V_5) = 5$.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of the exceptional divisor $E$. The exceptional divisor of the blowup of a variety at a point is isomorphic to the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$, where $n$ is the dimension of the ambient space. In this case, the ambient space is $\\mathbb{P}^5$, so the exceptional divisor is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^4$. The degree of projective space $\\mathbb{P}^k$ is always $1$, so Degree$(E) = 1$.\n\nUsing the formula for the degree of a blowup, we have:\n\nDegree$(X) = \\text{Degree}(V_5) \\cdot \\text{Degree}(E) = 5 \\cdot 1 = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the Fano variety $X$ obtained as the blowup of $V_5$ at a general point is $5$."
