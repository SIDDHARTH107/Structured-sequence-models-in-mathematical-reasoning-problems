    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection of the principal G-bundle over M, we first need to understand the local trivializations and the transition functions. Since the transition functions are given by constant matrix elements of G, we can assume that the local trivializations are given by open sets U_i in M and maps φ_i: U_i × G → P, where P is the principal G-bundle over M.\n\nNow, let's consider two open sets U_i and U_j with a non-empty intersection U_ij = U_i ∩ U_j. The transition functions g_ij: U_ij → G are given by constant matrix elements of G, so we can write g_ij(x) = const for all x in U_ij. The transition functions satisfy the cocycle condition: g_ii = 1 and g_ij * g_ji = 1.\n\nThe Cartan connection is a g-valued 1-form on P, which we denote by ω. We can pull back ω to the local trivializations U_i × G using the maps φ_i, obtaining g-valued 1-forms ω_i on U_i × G. The Cartan connection should satisfy the equivariance condition and the horizontal condition:\n\n1. Equivariance condition: ω_i = Ad(φ_i^* g_ij) ω_j + φ_i^* (g_ij^{-1} dg_ij), where Ad is the adjoint action of G on g.\n\n2. Horizontal condition: ω_i(X) = X for all X in g, where X is seen as a right-invariant vector field on G.\n\nSince the transition functions are constant, their derivatives vanish, and the equivariance condition simplifies to ω_i = Ad(φ_i^* g_ij) ω_j. To satisfy the horizontal condition, we can choose ω_i to be the Maurer-Cartan form on G, which is the unique g-valued 1-form on G satisfying the horizontal condition. Then, ω_i = Ad(φ_i^* g_ij) ω_j = Ad(g_ij^{-1}) ω_j, since the Maurer-Cartan form is invariant under the adjoint action.\n\nFinally, we can define the Cartan connection ω on P by requiring that φ_i^* ω = ω_i. This definition is consistent due to the equivariance condition, and ω satisfies the horizontal condition by construction. Therefore, the Cartan connection of the principal G-bundle over M with constant transition functions is given by ω, which is determined by the Maurer-Cartan forms on G and the constant transition functions g_ij."
