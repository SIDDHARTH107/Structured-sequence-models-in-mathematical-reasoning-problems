    "message_2": "Since f(z) is analytic, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n1. ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n2. ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nAlso, given that u(x, y) is a harmonic function, it satisfies Laplace's equation:\n\n3. ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nNow, let's consider the complex conjugate of f(z), denoted as g(z) = u(x, y) - iv(x, y). Since f(z) is analytic, g(z) is also analytic and satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n4. ∂u/∂x = -∂v/∂y\n5. ∂u/∂y = ∂v/∂x\n\nComparing equations 1 and 4, as well as equations 2 and 5, we find that:\n\n∂v/∂y = -∂v/∂y => ∂v/∂y = 0\n∂v/∂x = ∂v/∂x => ∂v/∂x = 0\n\nSince the partial derivatives of v(x, y) are zero, v(x, y) must be a constant function. Let's denote this constant as C.\n\nNow, let's find the function f(z) using the given conditions:\n\nu(1, 0) = 2 => f(1) = 2 + iC\nu(0, 1) = 3 => f(i) = 3 + iC\n\nSince f(z) is analytic, it has a power series representation:\n\nf(z) = a₀ + a₁z + a₂z² + ...\n\nUsing the given conditions, we can write two equations:\n\na₀ + a₁(1) + a₂(1)² + ... = 2 + iC\na₀ + a₁(i) + a₂(i)² + ... = 3 + iC\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\na₁(i - 1) + a₂(i² - 1) + ... = 1\n\nNow, let's find the value of u(2, 3):\n\nu(2, 3) = Re(f(2 + 3i))\n\nSince f(z) is analytic, it has a power series representation:\n\nf(z) = a₀ + a₁z + a₂z² + ...\n\nf(2 + 3i) = a₀ + a₁(2 + 3i) + a₂(2 + 3i)² + ...\n\nWe know that a₁(i - 1) + a₂(i² - 1) + ... = 1, so:\n\na₁(2 + 3i - 1) + a₂((2 + 3i)² - 1) + ... = 1 + iC\n\na₁(1 + 3i) + a₂(4 + 12i - 9 - 1) + ... = 1 + iC\n\na₁(1 + 3i) + a₂(-6 + 12i) + ... = 1 + iC\n\nNow, we can equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n1 = 1 - 6a₂\n3 = 3a₁ + 12a₂\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\na₂ = 0\na₁ = 1\n\nSo, f(z) = a₀ + a₁z, and f(2 + 3i) = a₀ + (1)(2 + 3i) = a₀ + 2 + 3i.\n\nSince f(1) = 2 + iC, we have a₀ + 1 = 2 + iC => a₀ = 1 - iC.\n\nTherefore, f(2 + 3i) = (1 - iC) + 2 + 3i = 3 + (3 - C)i.\n\nFinally, u(2, 3) = Re(f(2 + 3i)) = 3."
