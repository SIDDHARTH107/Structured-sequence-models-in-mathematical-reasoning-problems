    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function, we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign. First, let's find the first and second derivatives of the function f(x).\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nSecond derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, let's find the points where the second derivative is equal to zero, as these are the potential inflection points.\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nNow, we need to check if the second derivative changes its sign at x = 2. We can do this by testing the values of the second derivative at points slightly less than and slightly greater than 2.\n\nf''(1.9) = 6(1.9) - 12 = -0.6 (negative)\nf''(2.1) = 6(2.1) - 12 = 0.6 (positive)\n\nSince the second derivative changes its sign at x = 2, there is an inflection point at this value of x. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, we plug x = 2 back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) + 2 = 8 - 24 + 18 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the coordinates of the inflection point are (2, 4)."
