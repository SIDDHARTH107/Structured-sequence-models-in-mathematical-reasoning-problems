    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces light bulbs, and their quality control team has found that 1% of the bulbs produced are defective. A customer purchases a box of 20 bulbs. What is the probability that at least one of the bulbs in the box is defective according to Bayesian statistics?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of the bulbs in the box is defective, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that none of the bulbs are defective. \n\nThe probability that a single bulb is not defective is 99% (100% - 1%). Since the bulbs are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each bulb being not defective together for all 20 bulbs.\n\nP(None are defective) = (0.99)^20 ≈ 0.817\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability that at least one bulb is defective.\n\nP(At least one is defective) = 1 - P(None are defective) = 1 - 0.817 ≈ 0.183\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the bulbs in the box is defective is approximately 18.3%."
