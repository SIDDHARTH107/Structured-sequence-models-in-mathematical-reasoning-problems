    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing each column with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz).\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2  1 -1 |\n| 3 -2  4 |\n| 1  3 -1 |\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D):\n\nD = | 2  1 -1 | = 2 * | -2  4 | - 1 * | 3  4 | - (-1) * | 3 -2 |\n       | 3 -2  4 |          | 1  3 |          | 1  3 |          | 1  3 |\n\nD = 2 * (-2 * 3 - 4 * 1) - 1 * (3 * 3 - 4 * 1) + 1 * (3 * 3 - 2 * 1)\nD = 2 * (-6 - 4) - 1 * (9 - 4) + 1 * (9 - 2)\nD = 2 * (-10) - 1 * (5) + 1 * (7)\nD = -20 - 5 + 7\nD = -18\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the first column with the constants (Dx):\n\nDx = | 5  1 -1 | = 5 * | -2  4 | - 1 * | -7  4 | - (-1) * | -7 -2 |\n         | -7 -2  4 |          |  0  3 |          |  0  3 |          |  0  3 |\n\nDx = 5 * (-2 * 3 - 4 * 0) - 1 * (-7 * 3 - 4 * 0) + 1 * (-7 * 3 - 2 * 0)\nDx = 5 * (-6) - 1 * (-21) + 1 * (-21)\nDx = -30 + 21 - 21\nDx = -30\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the second column with the constants (Dy):\n\nDy = | 2  5 -1 | = 2 * | -7  4 | - 5 * | 3  4 | - (-1) * | 3  0 |\n         | 3  0  4 |          | 1  3 |          | 1  3 |          | 1  3 |\n\nDy = 2 * (-7 * 3 - 4 * 1) - 5 * (3 * 3 - 4 * 1) + 1 * (3 * 3 - 0 * 1)\nDy = 2 * (-21 - 4) - 5 * (9 - 4) + 1 * (9)\nDy = 2 * (-25) - 5 * (5) + 9\nDy = -50 - 25 + 9\nDy = -66\n\nFinally, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the third column with the constants (Dz):\n\nDz = | 2  1  5 | = 2 * | -2  5 | - 1 * | 3  5 | - 5 * | 3 -2 |\n         | 3 -2 -7 |          | 1  0 |          | 1  0 |          | 1  3 |\n\nDz = 2 * (-2 * 0 - 5 * 1) - 1 * (3 * 0 - 5 * 1) - 5 * (3 * 3 - 2 * 1)\nDz = 2 * (-5) - 1 * (-5) - 5 * (9 - 2)\nDz = -10 + 5 - 5 * (7)\nDz = -10 + 5 - 35\nDz = -40\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z using the determinants:\n\nx = Dx / D = -30 / -18 = 5/3\ny = Dy / D = -66 / -18 = 11/3\nz = Dz / D = -40 / -18 = 20/9\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy this system of equations are x = 5/3, y = 11/3, and z = 20/9."
