    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain type of cyber attack occurring on a network is 0.35. If the network experiences this type of attack 5 times in a year, what is the probability that the attack occurs at least once in any given month?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the attack occurs at least once in any given month, we can first find the probability that the attack does not occur in a month and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that the attack does not occur in a month is (1 - 0.35) = 0.65.\n\nSince there are 5 attacks in a year, we can assume that these attacks are uniformly distributed over the 12 months. The probability that none of the 5 attacks occur in a given month is (0.65)^5 = 0.116029.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one attack occurs in a given month by subtracting the probability that none of the attacks occur in that month from 1:\n\n1 - 0.116029 = 0.883971\n\nSo, the probability that the attack occurs at least once in any given month is approximately 0.884 or 88.4%."
