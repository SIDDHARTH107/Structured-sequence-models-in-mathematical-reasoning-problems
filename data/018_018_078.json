    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it consists of elements that are in A or B, but not in both.\n\nFirst, let's find the symmetric difference of set A and set B (A Δ B):\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {} (intersection of A and B, since they have no common elements)\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of set B and set A (B Δ A):\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (union of B and A)\nB ∩ A = {} (intersection of B and A, since they have no common elements)\n\nB Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nAs we can see, A Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Therefore, the symmetric difference of set A and set B is the same as the symmetric difference of set B and set A."
