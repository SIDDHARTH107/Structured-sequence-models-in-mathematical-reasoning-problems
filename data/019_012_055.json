    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to Paraconsistent logic: \n\nSuppose that P and Q are two propositions, and we know that P is true and Q is false. Using Paraconsistent logic, determine the truth value of the following propositions: \n\n1. P and Q\n2. P or Q\n3. ~(P and Q)",
    "message_2": "Using Paraconsistent logic, we can determine the truth values of the given propositions as follows:\n\n1. P and Q: In Paraconsistent logic, if one proposition is true and the other is false, the conjunction (P and Q) is considered false. So, the truth value of P and Q is false.\n\n2. P or Q: In Paraconsistent logic, the disjunction (P or Q) is true if at least one of the propositions is true. Since P is true, the truth value of P or Q is true.\n\n3. ~(P and Q): The negation of a proposition in Paraconsistent logic is true if the original proposition is false. Since P and Q is false, the truth value of ~(P and Q) is true."
