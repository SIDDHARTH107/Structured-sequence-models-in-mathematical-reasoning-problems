This means that the quadratic residues of 13 are those numbers n, such that n^2 mod 13 = k, where k is a nonnegative integer less than 13.",
    "message_2": "To find all the quadratic residues of 13, we will calculate the squares of the numbers from 0 to 12 (since 13 is a prime number, we only need to consider residues up to 12) and then take their residues modulo 13. \n\n0^2 mod 13 = 0\n1^2 mod 13 = 1\n2^2 mod 13 = 4\n3^2 mod 13 = 9\n4^2 mod 13 = 3\n5^2 mod 13 = 12\n6^2 mod 13 = 10\n7^2 mod 13 = 10\n8^2 mod 13 = 12\n9^2 mod 13 = 3\n10^2 mod 13 = 9\n11^2 mod 13 = 4\n12^2 mod 13 = 1\n\nNow, we can list the distinct residues obtained:\n\n0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\n\nThese are the quadratic residues of the number 13."
