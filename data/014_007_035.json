    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message using the XOR operation with a 6-bit key, we need to repeat the key until it has the same length as the plaintext message. In this case, the key needs to be repeated to have a length of 10 bits.\n\nKey: 100110\nRepeated key: 1001101001\n\nNow, we perform the XOR operation between the plaintext message and the repeated key:\n\nPlaintext:  1010010101\nKey:        1001101001\nXOR result: 0011111100\n\nThe ciphertext for the plaintext message 1010010101 using the key 100110 is 0011111100."
