    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the given connected graph with 12 vertices and 16 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the minimum number of edges required to form a cycle in a connected graph with 12 vertices. This can be done using the formula for the number of edges in a tree, which is E = V - 1, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. In this case, E = 12 - 1 = 11.\n\n2. Since the given graph has 16 edges, there are 16 - 11 = 5 extra edges that can potentially form cycles.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the possible cycle lengths that can be formed by these extra edges. The minimum cycle length is 3 (a triangle), as a cycle with only 2 edges is not possible.\n\n4. We can now use the Pigeonhole Principle to determine the girth of the graph. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n items to be placed into m containers, and n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\n5. In this case, the \"items\" are the extra edges, and the \"containers\" are the possible cycle lengths. Since there are 5 extra edges and 3 possible cycle lengths (3, 4, and 5), we can apply the Pigeonhole Principle to conclude that at least one of these cycle lengths must be present in the graph.\n\n6. Since we are looking for the shortest cycle, we can conclude that the girth of the graph is 3, as there must be at least one cycle of length 3 in the graph."
