    "message_2": "The Fermat primality test is a probabilistic test to determine if a number is likely prime or not. It is based on Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, 1 < a < p, the following equation holds:\n\na^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nNow, let's test the number 561 using the Fermat primality test. We'll choose some random values for a and check if the equation holds.\n\n1. Let a = 2:\n2^(561-1) ≡ 1 (mod 561)\n2^560 ≡ 1 (mod 561)\nAfter calculating, we get:\n1 ≡ 1 (mod 561)\n\n2. Let a = 3:\n3^(561-1) ≡ 1 (mod 561)\n3^560 ≡ 1 (mod 561)\nAfter calculating, we get:\n1 ≡ 1 (mod 561)\n\n3. Let a = 5:\n5^(561-1) ≡ 1 (mod 561)\n5^560 ≡ 1 (mod 561)\nAfter calculating, we get:\n1 ≡ 1 (mod 561)\n\nBased on these tests, it seems like 561 might be a prime number. However, the Fermat primality test is not foolproof, and there are some composite numbers, called Carmichael numbers, that can pass the test. In fact, 561 is a Carmichael number, and it is not prime. Its factors are 3, 11, and 17 (3 * 11 * 17 = 561). So, 561 is not a prime number."
