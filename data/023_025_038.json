    "message_1": "Here's a specific numerical problem the math student can solve using Fourier analysis: \n\nA particular metal has a crystal structure that is described as a face-centered cubic lattice. The interatomic spacing between its atoms is approximately 0.25 nm. Using the Fourier transform, determine the first order X-ray diffraction angle for this metal when irradiated with X-rays of wavelength 0.71 Å. \n\n(Note: The first order X-ray diffraction angle is the angle at which the intensity of the diffracted X-rays is maximum.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Bragg's Law, which relates the angle of diffraction (θ) to the interplanar spacing (d) and the wavelength of the X-rays (λ):\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of diffraction (in this case, n = 1 for the first order).\n\nFor a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, the interplanar spacing d can be calculated using the Miller indices (h, k, l) and the lattice parameter a:\n\nd = a / √(h² + k² + l²)\n\nFor the first order diffraction, we need to find the smallest non-zero value of d, which corresponds to the lowest non-zero values of h, k, and l. In an FCC lattice, the Miller indices must be either all even or all odd. The lowest non-zero values are (1, 1, 1), so:\n\nd = a / √(1² + 1² + 1²) = a / √3\n\nNow we need to find the lattice parameter a. We are given the interatomic spacing between the atoms, which is approximately 0.25 nm. In an FCC lattice, the lattice parameter a is related to the interatomic spacing r by:\n\na = 2√2 * r\n\nConverting the interatomic spacing to Å (1 nm = 10 Å):\n\nr = 0.25 nm * 10 Å/nm = 2.5 Å\n\nNow we can find the lattice parameter a:\n\na = 2√2 * 2.5 Å ≈ 7.071 Å\n\nNow we can find the interplanar spacing d:\n\nd = 7.071 Å / √3 ≈ 4.082 Å\n\nNow we can use Bragg's Law to find the first order X-ray diffraction angle:\n\n1 * 0.71 Å = 2 * 4.082 Å * sin(θ)\n\nSolving for θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (0.71 Å) / (2 * 4.082 Å) ≈ 0.087\n\nθ = arcsin(0.087) ≈ 5.00°\n\nSo, the first order X-ray diffraction angle for this metal when irradiated with X-rays of wavelength 0.71 Å is approximately 5.00°."
