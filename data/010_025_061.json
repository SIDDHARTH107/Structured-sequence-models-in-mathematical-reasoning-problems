    "message_1": "A closed oriented 2-dimensional surface can be represented by a genus g handlebody, that is a 3-dimensional ball minus g solid tori (Figure 1). For instance, the surface of a sphere can be represented by a genus 0 handlebody and the surface of a torus can be represented by a genus 1 handlebody. The Euler characteristic χ of the genus g handlebody can be computed by the formula:\n χ=2-2g.\n\nWhat is the Euler characteristic of a genus 3 handlebody?",
    "message_2": "Using the formula for the Euler characteristic χ of a genus g handlebody:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a genus 3 handlebody, we have g = 3. Plugging this into the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a genus 3 handlebody is -4."
