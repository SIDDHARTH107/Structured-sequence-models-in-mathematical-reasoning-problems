    "message_2": "If no one can stand directly in front of or behind another person, it means that they must be standing side by side. In this case, there are 6 people, and we need to find the number of ways to arrange them in a single row.\n\nThis is a simple permutation problem. The number of ways to arrange n objects is given by the formula n! (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n\nFor 6 people, the number of ways to arrange them is:\n\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nSo, there are 720 different ways to arrange the 6 people in a line so that no one is standing directly in front of or behind another person."
