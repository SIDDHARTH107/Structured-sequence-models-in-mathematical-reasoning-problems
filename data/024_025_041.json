    "message_2": "To find the value of $c_3(X)$, we need to use the Chern classes of the complex manifold $X$. The Chern classes are topological invariants of complex vector bundles, and they can be used to compute various topological quantities.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the values of $c_1(X)$ and $c_2(X)$, which are the first and second Chern classes of the manifold $X$. The Chern classes are related to the characteristic classes of the manifold, and they can be computed using the Chern-Weil theory.\n\nHowever, without more information about the complex manifold $X$, it is not possible to compute the value of $c_3(X)$. We would need additional information about the structure of the manifold, such as its Hodge numbers, Betti numbers, or other topological invariants.\n\nIn general, the Chern classes of a complex manifold are not determined by the lower Chern classes, so knowing $c_1(X)$ and $c_2(X)$ does not uniquely determine $c_3(X)$."
