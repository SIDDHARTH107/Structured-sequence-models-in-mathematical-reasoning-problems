    "message_1": "A torus has a minor radius of 5 cm and a major radius of 10 cm. What is the volume of the torus in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 10 cm and r = 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 10 * 5^3\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 10 * 125\n\nVolume = 2500 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 77871.93 cubic centimeters."
