    "message_2": "To find the non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we first need to find the possible factorizations of 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. Using the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, we can find the possible abelian groups of order 40:\n\n1. Z_40 (cyclic group of order 40)\n2. Z_2 * Z_20 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 2 and 20)\n3. Z_4 * Z_10 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 10)\n4. Z_8 * Z_5 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 8 and 5)\n\nNow, we need to consider non-abelian groups. Since 5 is a prime divisor of 40, we can use Sylow's theorems to find the number of 5-Sylow subgroups. Let n_5 be the number of 5-Sylow subgroups. By Sylow's theorems, n_5 must divide 8 (the index of the 5-Sylow subgroup) and n_5 â‰¡ 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1, which means there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, and it is normal.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup and let Q be a 2-Sylow subgroup. Since P is normal, the product PQ is a subgroup of order 40. If Q is also normal, then the group is the direct product of P and Q, which is abelian. So, we only need to consider the case where Q is not normal.\n\nIn this case, we can use the semidirect product of P and Q. The action of Q on P is determined by an automorphism of P. Since P is a cyclic group of order 5, it has 4 automorphisms. The group Q is isomorphic to one of the following: Z_8, Z_4 * Z_2, or Z_2^3. \n\n1. If Q is isomorphic to Z_8, there are 4 possible actions of Q on P, but one of them is trivial, which leads to the direct product Z_8 * Z_5. So, there are 3 non-abelian groups in this case.\n2. If Q is isomorphic to Z_4 * Z_2, there are 4 possible actions of Q on P, but one of them is trivial, which leads to the direct product Z_4 * Z_10. So, there are 3 non-abelian groups in this case.\n3. If Q is isomorphic to Z_2^3, there are 4 possible actions of Q on P, but one of them is trivial, which leads to the direct product Z_2 * Z_20. So, there are 3 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 4 abelian groups and 9 non-abelian groups, making a total of 13 non-isomorphic groups of order 40."
