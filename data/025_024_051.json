    "message_2": "Let $u = x+y$ and $v = x-y$. We want to find the equation of the curve in terms of $u$ and $v$. To do this, we need to express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$. We have:\n\n$x = \\frac{u+v}{2}$ and $y = \\frac{u-v}{2}$.\n\nNow substitute these expressions for $x$ and $y$ into the given polynomial equation:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{u+v}{2}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{u+v}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{u-v}{2}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{u-v}{2}\\right)^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{u+v}{2}\\right) - 2\\left(\\frac{u-v}{2}\\right) - 1 = 0$.\n\nNow simplify the equation:\n\n$\\frac{u^2 + 2uv + v^2}{4} + \\frac{u^2 - v^2}{2} + \\frac{u^2 - 2uv + v^2}{4} - u - v - 1 = 0$.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n$\\frac{u^2 + 2uv + v^2 + 2u^2 - 2v^2 + u^2 - 2uv + v^2}{4} - u - v - 1 = 0$.\n\nSimplify further:\n\n$\\frac{4u^2}{4} - u - v - 1 = 0$.\n\nFinally, we get the equation of the parabola in terms of $u$ and $v$:\n\n$u^2 - u - v - 1 = 0$.\n\nThus, the equation of the parabola that is the image of the given curve under the transformation $(x,y) \\to (x+y, x-y)$ is $u^2 - u - v - 1 = 0$."
