    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the given graph, we need to color the edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color. Let's use the colors R (red), G (green), and B (blue) to color the edges.\n\n```\nA---B\n|\\ /|\n| X |\n|/ \\|\nC---D\n```\n\nWe can color the edges as follows:\n\n```\nA - R - B\n|\\    /|\nG  X  B\n|/    \\|\nC - R - D\n```\n\nIn this coloring, no two adjacent edges have the same color. We used 3 colors (R, G, and B) to color the edges of the graph. Therefore, the chromatic index of the given graph is 3."
