    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal that is constructed by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the number of smaller cubes increases. The formula to calculate the number of smaller cubes in the nth iteration is:\n\nNumber of smaller cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the sixth iteration (n = 6), the total number of smaller cubes is:\n\nNumber of smaller cubes = 20^6 = 64,000,000"
