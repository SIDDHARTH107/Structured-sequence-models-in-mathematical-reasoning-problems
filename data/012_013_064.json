    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. We will start by selecting an edge, say (2,3), and then perform deletion and contraction operations on it.\n\nDeletion: Remove the edge (2,3) from the graph. The resulting graph G' has the following edges: (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7). The chromatic polynomial of G' is P(G', k).\n\nContraction: Contract the edge (2,3) by merging vertices 2 and 3 into a single vertex, say v. The resulting graph G'' has the following edges: (1,v), (v,4), (4,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7). The chromatic polynomial of G'' is P(G'', k).\n\nNow, we can express the chromatic polynomial of G as P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k).\n\nTo find P(G', k) and P(G'', k), we can apply the same deletion-contraction algorithm recursively. After several steps, we will obtain the chromatic polynomials of smaller and simpler graphs, which can be easily computed.\n\nFor G', we can find that P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k^2 - 5k + 6).\n\nFor G'', we can find that P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4).\n\nNow, we can compute the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k^2 - 5k + 6) - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4).\n\nFactoring out the common terms, we get:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)[(k^2 - 5k + 6) - (k-4)] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k^2 - 4k + 2).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k^2 - 4k + 2)."
