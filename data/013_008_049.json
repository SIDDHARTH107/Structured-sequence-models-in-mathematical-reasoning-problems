    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a public goods game, three players are each given $10. At each round of the game, each player can choose to either keep their money or contribute it to a public fund. The total amount in the public fund is multiplied by 1.5 and then split evenly among all three players, regardless of whether they contributed or not. If all three players contribute, they each receive $7.50 from the public fund (for a total of $22.50 each). If only two players contribute, they each receive $10 from the public fund (for a total of $20 each), and the non-contributing player keeps their $10. If only one player contributes, they receive $15 from the public fund (for a total of $25), and the other two players keep their $10.\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium for this game?",
    "message_2": "A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In this public goods game, we can find the Nash equilibrium by analyzing the possible outcomes for each player based on their decisions.\n\nLet's consider the possible strategies for each player:\n\n1. Contribute to the public fund\n2. Keep their money\n\nNow, let's analyze the outcomes for each player based on the strategies of the other players:\n\n- If all three players contribute, they each receive $7.50 from the public fund (for a total of $22.50 each).\n- If two players contribute and one player keeps their money, the contributing players each receive $10 from the public fund (for a total of $20 each), and the non-contributing player keeps their $10.\n- If one player contributes and the other two players keep their money, the contributing player receives $15 from the public fund (for a total of $25), and the non-contributing players keep their $10.\n- If no players contribute, they all keep their $10.\n\nIn this game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when all three players choose to keep their money. This is because, given the strategies of the other players, no player has an incentive to change their strategy. If a player decides to contribute while the others keep their money, they will end up with less money ($15) than if they had kept their money ($10). Similarly, if a player decides to keep their money while the others contribute, they will still end up with $10, which is not worse than any other outcome.\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium for this public goods game is for all three players to keep their money."
