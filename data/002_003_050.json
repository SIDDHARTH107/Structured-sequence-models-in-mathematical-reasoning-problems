    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula: Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2. In this case, the side length is 5 centimeters. \n\nSurface Area = 6 * (5 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 6 * 25 cm^2\nSurface Area = 150 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube with a side length of 5 centimeters is 150 square centimeters."
