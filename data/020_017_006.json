    "message_1": "A cable TV company is planning to install a new cable line between two cities that are 20 miles apart. The cable company can choose to install the cable underground or aboveground. The underground installation will cost $200 per mile, and the aboveground installation will cost $150 per mile. The company wants to minimize the total cost of installation. What is the most cost-effective option for the cable company?",
    "message_2": "To determine the most cost-effective option, we need to calculate the total cost of installation for both underground and aboveground options.\n\nUnderground installation cost:\nCost per mile = $200\nTotal miles = 20\nTotal cost = 200 * 20 = $4,000\n\nAboveground installation cost:\nCost per mile = $150\nTotal miles = 20\nTotal cost = 150 * 20 = $3,000\n\nComparing the total costs, the aboveground installation is the most cost-effective option with a total cost of $3,000, while the underground installation would cost $4,000."
