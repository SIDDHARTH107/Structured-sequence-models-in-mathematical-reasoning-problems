    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and let B and C be its complements. If B ∪ {6, 7} = C ∪ {8}, determine the values of B and C.",
    "message_2": "Since B and C are complements of A, they both contain all the elements that are not in A. Since A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B and C will contain all the elements except for these.\n\nNow, we are given that B ∪ {6, 7} = C ∪ {8}. This means that the union of B with the set {6, 7} is equal to the union of C with the set {8}. \n\nLet's first find the elements that are common to both B and C. Since they are both complements of A, they will have the same elements except for the ones mentioned in the given condition. So, let's call this common set D.\n\nD = {x | x ∉ A}\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given condition using D:\n\nB = D ∪ {6, 7}\nC = D ∪ {8}\n\nSince B ∪ {6, 7} = C ∪ {8}, we can equate the two expressions for B and C:\n\nD ∪ {6, 7} = D ∪ {8}\n\nNow, we can see that the only difference between B and C is that B has the elements 6 and 7, while C has the element 8. Therefore, we can find B and C as follows:\n\nB = D ∪ {6, 7}\nC = D ∪ {8}\n\nSince A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the complements B and C will contain all the elements except for these. Let's assume the universal set U contains elements from 1 to 10 for simplicity:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can find the set D by subtracting the elements of A from the universal set U:\n\nD = U - A = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can find B and C using the expressions we derived earlier:\n\nB = D ∪ {6, 7} = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ∪ {6, 7} = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nC = D ∪ {8} = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ∪ {8} = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSo, B = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and C = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}."
