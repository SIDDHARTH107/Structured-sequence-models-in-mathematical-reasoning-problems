    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the pizza slice, we need to find the length of the arc and the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 16 inches, the radius is half of that:\n\nradius = diameter / 2\nradius = 16 inches / 2\nradius = 8 inches\n\nNow, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the arc length is:\n\narc length = (central angle / 360) * (2 * pi * radius)\n\nThe central angle is given as 45 degrees, so we can plug in the values:\n\narc length = (45 / 360) * (2 * pi * 8)\narc length = (1/8) * (16 * pi)\narc length = 2 * pi\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the pizza slice. The perimeter consists of the arc length and the two radii:\n\nperimeter = arc length + 2 * radius\nperimeter = 2 * pi + 2 * 8\nperimeter = 2 * pi + 16\n\nThe perimeter of the pizza slice is 2 * pi + 16 inches."
