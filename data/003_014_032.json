    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift of the function y = 3sin(2x + pi/4) - 2, we can compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D.\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 3, so the amplitude is 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is the length of one complete cycle. The period of the standard sine function is 2π. To find the period of the given function, we can use the formula Period = (2π) / |B|. In this case, B = 2, so the period is (2π) / 2 = π.\n\nPhase Shift (C): The phase shift is the horizontal shift of the function. It is given by the value of C in the general form. In this case, we have 2x + pi/4, so we need to rewrite it in the form B(x - C). We can rewrite it as 2(x + pi/8), so the phase shift is C = -pi/8.\n\nVertical Shift (D): The vertical shift is the constant term added to the sine function. In this case, D = -2, so the vertical shift is -2.\n\nIn summary, for the function y = 3sin(2x + pi/4) - 2:\n- Amplitude: 3\n- Period: π\n- Phase Shift: -pi/8\n- Vertical Shift: -2"
