    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between points, i.e., it preserves the metric. Let's consider a transformation $(x, y) \\mapsto (X(x, y), Y(x, y))$, where $X(x, y)$ and $Y(x, y)$ are smooth functions. We want to find all such transformations that preserve the given metric.\n\nUnder this transformation, we have:\n\n$$dX = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} dy$$\n$$dY = \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} dy$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the metric:\n\n$$ds^2 = 3(dX)^2 + 6dXdY + 5(dY)^2$$\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\n$$ds^2 = 3\\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} dy\\right)^2 + 6\\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} dy\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} dy\\right) + 5\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} dy\\right)^2$$\n\nNow, we group the terms with $dx^2$, $dy^2$, and $dxdy$:\n\n$$ds^2 = \\left[3\\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + 6\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x} + 5\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\right)^2\\right]dx^2 + \\left[3\\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 + 6\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} + 5\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y}\\right)^2\\right]dy^2 + 2\\left[3\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} + 3\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y}\\right]dxdy$$\n\nFor the transformation to be an isometry, we must have:\n\n1. $3\\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + 6\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x} + 5\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 = 3$\n2. $3\\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 + 6\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} + 5\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 = 5$\n3. $3\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} + 3\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} = 3$\n\nThese are three partial differential equations that must be satisfied by the functions $X(x, y)$ and $Y(x, y)$. Solving these equations is quite involved and requires advanced techniques from the theory of partial differential equations. However, we can make some observations:\n\n1. Linear transformations of the form $X(x, y) = ax + by + c$ and $Y(x, y) = dx + ey + f$ with constant coefficients $a, b, c, d, e, f$ will satisfy the equations if the coefficients are chosen appropriately. These transformations correspond to translations, rotations, and scaling.\n\n2. In general, the solutions will involve more complicated functions of $x$ and $y$. However, finding explicit expressions for these functions is beyond the scope of this answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the isometries of the given metric include linear transformations (translations, rotations, and scaling) and potentially more complicated functions of $x$ and $y$. To find explicit expressions for these functions, one would need to solve the system of partial differential equations given above."
