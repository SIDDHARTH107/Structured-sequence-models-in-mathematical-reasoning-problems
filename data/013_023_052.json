    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, player 1 starts with $10 and decides how much to send to player 2. Player 2 receives the amount sent by player 1 and decides how much (if any) to return to player 1. Whatever amount player 2 returns is then tripled and received by player 1. If player 2 does not return any money, player 1 gets nothing. If player 1 sends $4 to player 2 and player 2 decides to return $2, how much money does player 1 receive?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, player 1 sends $4 to player 2, and player 2 decides to return $2. Since the returned amount is tripled, player 1 will receive 3 * $2 = $6."
