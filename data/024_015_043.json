    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we apply the rules of exterior differentiation to the given differential form $\\omega = x^2 dy + y^2 dx$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a differential form is a linear operation, and it satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. $d(\\alpha + \\beta) = d\\alpha + d\\beta$ for differential forms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n2. $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{|\\alpha|} \\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$ for differential forms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, where $|\\alpha|$ denotes the degree of the form $\\alpha$.\n3. $d(d\\alpha) = 0$ for any differential form $\\alpha$.\n\nIn our case, $\\omega = x^2 dy + y^2 dx$. We can treat $x^2 dy$ and $y^2 dx$ as separate differential forms and apply the exterior derivative to each of them:\n\n$d(x^2 dy) = d(x^2) \\wedge dy = (2x dx) \\wedge dy = 2x dx \\wedge dy$\n\n$d(y^2 dx) = d(y^2) \\wedge dx = (2y dy) \\wedge dx = -2y dy \\wedge dx$\n\nNow, we can apply the linearity property (1) to compute the exterior derivative of $\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = d(x^2 dy + y^2 dx) = d(x^2 dy) + d(y^2 dx) = 2x dx \\wedge dy - 2y dy \\wedge dx$\n\nSince $dx \\wedge dy = -dy \\wedge dx$, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$d\\omega = 2x dx \\wedge dy + 2y dy \\wedge dx = (2x + 2y) dx \\wedge dy$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ of the differential form $\\omega$ on the manifold $M$ is:\n\n$d\\omega = (2x + 2y) dx \\wedge dy$."
