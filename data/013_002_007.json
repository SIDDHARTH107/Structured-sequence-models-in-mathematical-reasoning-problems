    "message_1": "Suppose two companies, A and B, are bidding for a contract worth $10 million. Each company can choose to bid high (H) or bid low (L). If both companies bid low, the contract will be split evenly between them. If one company bids high and the other bids low, the high bidder will win the entire contract. If both companies bid high, the contract will be split evenly between them minus a penalty cost of $1 million each for bidding too aggressively. Find the Nash equilibrium for this game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the payoffs for each company based on their bidding strategies. Let's create a payoff matrix for this game:\n\n```\n          Company B\n          L       H\n        +-------+-------+\n   L  | (5, 5) | (0, 10)|\nCompany A       +-------+\n   H  | (10, 0) | (4, 4) |\n        +-------+-------+\n```\n\nIn this matrix, the first number in each pair represents the payoff for Company A, and the second number represents the payoff for Company B. For example, if both companies bid low (L), they each receive $5 million.\n\nNow, let's find the Nash equilibrium by analyzing each company's best response to the other's strategy:\n\n1. If Company B bids low (L), Company A's best response is to bid high (H) and win the entire contract, earning $10 million.\n2. If Company B bids high (H), Company A's best response is to also bid high (H) and split the contract, earning $4 million.\n\nSimilarly, for Company B:\n\n1. If Company A bids low (L), Company B's best response is to bid high (H) and win the entire contract, earning $10 million.\n2. If Company A bids high (H), Company B's best response is to also bid high (H) and split the contract, earning $4 million.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both companies choose a strategy that is their best response to the other's strategy. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when both companies bid high (H) and split the contract, each earning $4 million. This is because neither company can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy."
