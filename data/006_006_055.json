    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of scoring exactly k goals\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of shots taken)\n- k is the number of successful trials (in this case, the number of goals scored)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of scoring a goal from any given shot)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of not scoring a goal from any given shot)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (the striker takes 5 shots)\n- k = 3 (we want to find the probability of scoring exactly 3 goals)\n- p = 0.6 (the probability of scoring a goal from any given shot)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(5, 3), which is the number of combinations of 5 shots taken 3 at a time:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\n          = 5! / (3! * 2!)\n          = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n          = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)\n          = 10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(5-3)\n          = 10 * (0.6)^3 * (1-0.6)^(5-3)\n          = 10 * (0.6)^3 * (0.4)^2\n          = 10 * 0.216 * 0.16\n          = 10 * 0.03456\n          = 0.3456\n\nSo, the probability that the striker scores exactly 3 goals in the match is 0.3456, or 34.56%."
