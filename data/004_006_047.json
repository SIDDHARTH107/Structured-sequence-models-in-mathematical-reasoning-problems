    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1, we first need to find its first and second derivatives.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nSecond derivative:\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the equation:\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nTo classify these critical points, we will use the second derivative test. We will evaluate the second derivative at these critical points:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the critical point x = 1 is a local maximum.\nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point x = 3 is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1 has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = 3."
