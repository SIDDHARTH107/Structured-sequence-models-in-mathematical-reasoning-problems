    "message_2": "In the expansion of (a + b)^n, the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial coefficients from Pascal's triangle. The coefficient of the k-th term in the expansion is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k-1), where n is the exponent and k is the term number.\n\nFor the expansion of (a + b)^8, we want to find the coefficient of the 5th term. Using the binomial coefficient formula, we have:\n\nC(8, 5-1) = C(8, 4)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 40320 / (24 * 24)\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo, the coefficient of the 5th term in the expansion of (a + b)^8 is 70."
