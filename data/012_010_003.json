    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum size of a vertex cover is the smallest number of vertices needed to cover all the edges.\n\nIn this graph, we can choose vertices B and C as the vertex cover. This covers all the edges:\n\n- Edge AB is covered by vertex B\n- Edge AC is covered by vertex C\n- Edge BC is covered by vertex B\n- Edge CD is covered by vertex C\n\nSo, the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph is 2."
