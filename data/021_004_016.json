    "message_2": "To find the numerical approximation of the first derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 at x = 2 using the forward difference method with step size h = 0.1, we can use the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere f'(x) is the first derivative of f(x), x = 2, and h = 0.1.\n\nFirst, let's find f(2) and f(2 + 0.1):\n\nf(2) = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15\nf(2 + 0.1) = (2.1)^3 + (2.1)^2 + 2.1 + 1 ≈ 9.261 + 4.41 + 2.1 + 1 = 16.771\n\nNow, we can find the numerical approximation of the first derivative:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.1) - f(2)) / 0.1 ≈ (16.771 - 15) / 0.1 ≈ 17.71\n\nTo calculate the error of the approximation, we need to find the exact value of the first derivative. To do this, we can find the derivative of f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 2:\n\nf(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1\nf'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1\n\nNow, let's find the exact value of the first derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 3(4) + 4 + 1 = 12 + 4 + 1 = 17\n\nFinally, we can calculate the error of the approximation:\n\nError = |Exact value - Approximation| = |17 - 17.71| ≈ 0.71\n\nSo, the numerical approximation of the first derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 at x = 2 using the forward difference method with step size h = 0.1 is 17.71, and the error of the approximation is approximately 0.71."
