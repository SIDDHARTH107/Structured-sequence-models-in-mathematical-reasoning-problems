    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity vector, we need to break down the velocity into its components along the x-axis (East) and y-axis (North). Since the boat is traveling towards the Northeast, it is moving at a 45-degree angle with respect to the x-axis.\n\nWe can use trigonometry to find the components of the velocity vector. The x-component (Vx) and y-component (Vy) can be found using the following formulas:\n\nVx = V * cos(θ)\nVy = V * sin(θ)\n\nWhere V is the magnitude of the velocity (20 km/h) and θ is the angle with respect to the x-axis (45 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 45 * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can find the x and y components of the velocity:\n\nVx = 20 * cos(π/4) = 20 * (√2/2) = 10√2 km/h\nVy = 20 * sin(π/4) = 20 * (√2/2) = 10√2 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV = √(Vx^2 + Vy^2) = √((10√2)^2 + (10√2)^2) = √(200 + 200) = √400 = 20 km/h\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector can be found using the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Vy / Vx) = arctan(10√2 / 10√2) = arctan(1) = π/4 radians\n\nConverting the angle back to degrees:\n\nθ = (π/4) * (180/π) = 45 degrees\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's velocity vector is 20 km/h, and its direction is 45 degrees towards the Northeast."
