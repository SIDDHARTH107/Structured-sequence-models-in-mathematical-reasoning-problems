    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 2378 is divided by 12 using modular arithmetic, we can use the modulo operation. The modulo operation is represented by the percentage symbol (%) and gives the remainder when one number is divided by another.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n2378 % 12\n\nWhen we perform this calculation, we get:\n\n2378 % 12 = 2\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 2378 is divided by 12 is 2."
