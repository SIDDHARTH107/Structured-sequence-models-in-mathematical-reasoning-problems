If only one works hard and the other shirks, the company earns a profit of $100,000. If they both shirk, the company earns no profit.\nHowever, the employees' effort levels are not observable, and they have a 50% chance of shirking each day. To incentivize them to work harder, the company offers a bonus of $50,000 to the employee who works harder. \nWhat is the Nash equilibrium and what is the expected profit for the company?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the payoffs for each employee under different scenarios. Let's denote the probability of working hard as p and the probability of shirking as (1-p). The payoffs for each employee are as follows:\n\n1. Both work hard: The company earns $200,000, and each employee gets a bonus of $50,000. The payoff for each employee is $50,000.\n\n2. One works hard, and the other shirks: The company earns $100,000, and the hard-working employee gets a bonus of $50,000. The payoff for the hard-working employee is $50,000, and the shirking employee gets $0.\n\n3. Both shirk: The company earns $0, and neither employee gets a bonus. The payoff for each employee is $0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the Nash equilibrium. In a Nash equilibrium, no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. Suppose both employees choose to work hard with probability p. In this case, the expected payoff for each employee is:\n\nE(payoff) = p * (p * $50,000 + (1-p) * $50,000) + (1-p) * (p * $0 + (1-p) * $0)\nE(payoff) = p * $50,000\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find the value of p that maximizes the expected payoff for each employee. Taking the derivative of the expected payoff with respect to p and setting it to zero, we get:\n\nd(E(payoff))/dp = $50,000 = 0\n\nHowever, this equation has no solution for p, which means there is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. Instead, we need to look for a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, where each employee randomizes between working hard and shirking.\n\nLet p be the probability that employee 1 works hard, and q be the probability that employee 2 works hard. In a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, each employee is indifferent between working hard and shirking, so their expected payoffs must be equal:\n\np * $50,000 = (1-p) * $0\nq * $50,000 = (1-q) * $0\n\nSolving these equations, we find that p = q = 1. This means that in the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, both employees always work hard.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for the company in this Nash equilibrium. Since both employees always work hard, the company earns a profit of $200,000 every day. However, it pays a bonus of $50,000 to each employee, so the net profit is:\n\nExpected profit = $200,000 - 2 * $50,000 = $100,000\n\nIn the Nash equilibrium, the expected profit for the company is $100,000."
