Use an initial vector ```[1, 1, 1]``` and iterate until the relative error between two consecutive eigenvector approximations is less than or equal to ```0.01``` (i.e., ```0.01``` percent).",
    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial vector `v0 = [1, 1, 1]`.\n2. Compute the product `Av0`.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector to get the new approximation `v1`.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the relative error between two consecutive eigenvector approximations is less than or equal to 0.01.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method:\n\nA = [[3, 1, 1], [1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3]]\nv0 = [1, 1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\nAv0 = [5, 5, 5]\nv1 = [1, 1, 1] (normalized)\n\nIteration 2:\nAv1 = [5, 5, 5]\nv2 = [1, 1, 1] (normalized)\n\nSince the eigenvector approximation did not change after the first iteration, the relative error is already 0, which is less than or equal to 0.01. Therefore, we can stop the iteration process.\n\nNow, to find the dominant eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\n位 = (v2^T * A * v2) / (v2^T * v2)\n\n位 = ([1, 1, 1] * [[3, 1, 1], [1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3]] * [1, 1, 1]) / ([1, 1, 1] * [1, 1, 1])\n\n位 = (5 + 5 + 5) / 3\n\n位 = 5\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is 5, and its corresponding eigenvector is [1, 1, 1]."
