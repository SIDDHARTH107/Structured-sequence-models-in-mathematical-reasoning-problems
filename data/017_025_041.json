    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the structure of the group G of order 120. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exist Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor of the order of G. Let's denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups as n_p.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2 must divide 3 * 5 = 15, and n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 15.\n\nFor the Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3 must divide 2^3 * 5 = 40, and n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 10.\n\nFor the Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5 must divide 2^3 * 3 = 24, and n_5 must be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then G has unique Sylow subgroups for each prime divisor, and G is the direct product of these subgroups. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, then G has a normal subgroup isomorphic to A5. Since A5 is simple and has order 60, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G must be 6 (as in A5). Therefore, n_5 = 6.\n\n3. For the remaining 487 non-abelian groups of order 120, we can't explicitly list all of them, but we can provide some general properties that distinguish them from the previous cases. For example, they may have different numbers of Sylow subgroups (e.g., n_2 = 15, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6) or different structures of normal subgroups.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 120 can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or any of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120, depending on the properties of its Sylow subgroups and normal subgroups. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, one would need more information about the specific structure of G."
