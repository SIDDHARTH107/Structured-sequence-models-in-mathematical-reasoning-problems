    "message_2": "To solve the equation log₃(5x-1) + log₃(x+2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the product rule, which states that logₐ(b) + logₐ(c) = logₐ(bc). Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n\nlog₃((5x-1)(x+2)) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n3² = (5x-1)(x+2)\n\n9 = (5x-1)(x+2)\n\nNow, we can expand the expression on the right side:\n\n9 = 5x² + 10x - x - 2\n\n9 = 5x² + 9x - 2\n\nNow, we can set the equation to 0 by subtracting 9 from both sides:\n\n0 = 5x² + 9x - 11\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = 9, and c = -11. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-9 ± √(9² - 4(5)(-11))) / (2(5))\n\nx = (-9 ± √(81 + 220)) / 10\n\nx = (-9 ± √301) / 10\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are:\n\nx = (-9 + √301) / 10 and x = (-9 - √301) / 10"
