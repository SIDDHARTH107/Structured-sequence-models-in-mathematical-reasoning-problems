    "message_2": "Since f is a smooth function on M and f(p) = 1 for every point p in M, this means that f is a constant function. Now, let's consider the gradient of f, denoted by ∇f. Since f is constant, its gradient must be zero everywhere on M:\n\n∇f = 0\n\nNow, let's consider the connected components of M. A connected component of a topological space is a maximal connected subset, meaning that there are no other connected subsets containing it. Since M is a differentiable manifold, it is also a topological space.\n\nTo find the number of connected components of M, we can use the fact that the gradient of f is zero everywhere. This means that f does not change its value along any path in M, and thus, all points in M are connected through paths with the same value of f.\n\nTherefore, M itself is a connected set, and there are no other connected subsets containing it. This implies that M has only one connected component. So, the number of connected components of M is 1."
