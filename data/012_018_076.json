    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In this case, we can analyze the given edge sequence to determine the edge connectivity.\n\nThe given edge sequence is:\n\n(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 7).\n\nWe can see that vertices 1 and 2 are connected by a single edge (1, 2), and vertices 1 and 3 are connected by a single edge (1, 3). If we remove either of these edges, the graph will be disconnected. Therefore, the edge connectivity of the graph is 1."
