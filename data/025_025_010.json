    "message_2": "First, let's find the order of S and T as subgroups of GL(2, C).\n\nFor S, an upper triangular matrix A has the form:\n\nA = | a  b |\n    | 0  c |\n\nFor A to be invertible, both a and c must be nonzero. Since a and c are complex numbers, there are |C| - 1 = ∞ - 1 = ∞ choices for each of them. For b, it can be any complex number, so there are |C| = ∞ choices for b. Therefore, the order of S is (∞ - 1) * ∞ = ∞.\n\nFor T, a diagonal matrix A has the form:\n\nA = | a  0 |\n    | 0  c |\n\nSimilar to S, for A to be invertible, both a and c must be nonzero. There are |C| - 1 = ∞ - 1 = ∞ choices for each of them. Therefore, the order of T is (∞ - 1) * (∞ - 1) = ∞.\n\nNow, we can calculate the product of the orders of S and T:\n\nProduct = |S| * |T| = ∞ * ∞ = ∞.\n\nSo, the product of the orders of S and T as subgroups of the multiplicative group of invertible matrices GL(2, C) is ∞."
