    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). Therefore, we are looking for the smallest prime number p such that n = p.\n\nThe smallest prime number is 2, but (2-1)! = 1! = 1, which does not satisfy the given condition. The next smallest prime number is 3, and (3-1)! = 2! = 2, which does satisfy the condition (2! ≡ -1 (mod 3)).\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer n is 3."
