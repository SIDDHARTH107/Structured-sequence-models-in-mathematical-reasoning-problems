    "message_2": "To find the value of Euler's totient function, φ(n), for n = 15, we first need to find the prime factors of 15. The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5.\n\nEuler's totient function is given by the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 15, the prime factors are 3 and 5. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nφ(15) = 15 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(15) = 15 * (2/3) * (4/5)\nφ(15) = (15 * 2 * 4) / (3 * 5)\nφ(15) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function, φ(15), is 8."
