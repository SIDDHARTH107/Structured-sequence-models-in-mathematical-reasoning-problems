    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of the number 18079198 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % N, where N is the number we want to factor.\n2. Choose a random starting value x0.\n3. Iterate the function f(x) to generate a sequence of integers: x1 = f(x0), x2 = f(x1), x3 = f(x2), ...\n4. At each step, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between the current and previous values (|xi - xi-1|) and N.\n5. If the GCD is greater than 1 and less than N, then it is a non-trivial factor of N. If the GCD is equal to N, the algorithm has failed, and we need to restart with a different random function or starting value.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the smallest prime factor of 18079198:\n\n1. Choose f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % 18079198 and a random starting value x0 = 2.\n2. Generate the sequence of integers using f(x):\n   x1 = f(x0) = (2^2 + 1) % 18079198 = 5\n   x2 = f(x1) = (5^2 + 1) % 18079198 = 26\n   x3 = f(x2) = (26^2 + 1) % 18079198 = 677\n   ...\n3. Compute the GCDs at each step:\n   GCD(|5 - 2|, 18079198) = GCD(3, 18079198) = 1\n   GCD(|26 - 5|, 18079198) = GCD(21, 18079198) = 1\n   GCD(|677 - 26|, 18079198) = GCD(651, 18079198) = 1\n   ...\n4. Continue this process until we find a GCD greater than 1. After a few more iterations, we get:\n   GCD(|1870 - 677|, 18079198) = GCD(1193, 18079198) = 1\n   GCD(|1394 - 1870|, 18079198) = GCD(476, 18079198) = 2\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor of 18079198, which is 2. Since 2 is a prime number, it is the smallest prime factor of 18079198."
