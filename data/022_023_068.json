    "message_1": "A wire antenna of length 10 meters is excited with a current of 2 amps. The current distribution along the antenna is sinusoidal. Suppose that the antenna is surrounded by a medium with a refractive index of 1.5. At a distance of 100 meters from the antenna, determine the magnitude and phase of the electric field of the radiated wave at a frequency of 1 MHz. Use complex analysis of wave equations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude and phase of the electric field of the radiated wave, we will use the complex analysis of wave equations. First, let's find the wavelength and wave number in the medium.\n\nGiven:\nRefractive index (n) = 1.5\nFrequency (f) = 1 MHz = 1 x 10^6 Hz\nSpeed of light in vacuum (c) = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nSpeed of light in the medium (v) = c / n = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / 1.5 = 2 x 10^8 m/s\n\nWavelength (λ) = v / f = (2 x 10^8 m/s) / (1 x 10^6 Hz) = 200 m\n\nWave number (k) = 2π / λ = (2π) / 200 = π / 100\n\nNow, let's find the electric field magnitude and phase using the complex analysis of wave equations. We will use the far-field approximation for the electric field, which is given by:\n\nE = (j * η * I * e^(-jkr) * sin(πL/λ)) / (2πr)\n\nWhere:\nE = electric field\nη = intrinsic impedance of the medium (approximately 377 Ω for air)\nI = current (2 A)\nr = distance from the antenna (100 m)\nL = length of the antenna (10 m)\nj = imaginary unit\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate the electric field:\n\nE = (j * 377 * 2 * e^(-j(π/100)*100) * sin(π*10/200)) / (2π*100)\nE = (j * 754 * e^(-jπ) * sin(π/2)) / (200π)\n\nSince e^(-jπ) = -1 and sin(π/2) = 1, we get:\n\nE = (j * 754 * -1) / (200π)\nE = -j * 754 / (200π)\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field is:\n\n|E| = 754 / (200π) ≈ 1.2 V/m\n\nThe phase of the electric field is given by the argument of the complex number -j, which is -90 degrees.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the electric field at a distance of 100 meters from the antenna is approximately 1.2 V/m, and the phase is -90 degrees."
