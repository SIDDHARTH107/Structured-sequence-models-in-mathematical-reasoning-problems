    "message_2": "To prove the first part, we will use Poincaré duality. Poincaré duality states that for a compact oriented manifold $M$ of dimension $m$, there is an isomorphism:\n\n$$ H^i(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_{m-i}(M; \\mathbb{Z}). $$\n\nNow, let's consider the Euler characteristic of $M$, denoted by $\\chi(M)$. The Euler characteristic is defined as:\n\n$$ \\chi(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i \\dim H_i(M; \\mathbb{Z}). $$\n\nUsing Poincaré duality, we can rewrite the Euler characteristic as:\n\n$$ \\chi(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i \\dim H^i(M; \\mathbb{Z}). $$\n\nSince $H^i(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ has a rank of $r_i$ for $i=0,1,\\dots,m$, we can further rewrite the Euler characteristic as:\n\n$$ \\chi(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i r_i. $$\n\nNow, we know that for a compact oriented manifold, the Euler characteristic is always zero:\n\n$$ 0 = \\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i r_i. $$\n\nThis proves the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we are given that $M$ is a compact 3-manifold and $H^i(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ for $i=0,1,2$. This means that $r_0 = r_1 = r_2 = 2$. Since $M$ is a 3-manifold, $r_3$ must also be defined. Using the result from the first part, we have:\n\n$$ 0 = \\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i r_i = r_0 - r_1 + r_2 - r_3. $$\n\nSubstituting the values for $r_0$, $r_1$, and $r_2$, we get:\n\n$$ 0 = 2 - 2 + 2 - r_3 \\Rightarrow r_3 = 2. $$\n\nNow, we can find the value of $\\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i r_i$:\n\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i r_i = r_0 - r_1 + r_2 - r_3 = 2 - 2 + 2 - 2 = 0. $$"
