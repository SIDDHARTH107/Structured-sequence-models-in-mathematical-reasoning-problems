    "message_2": "To find the period of oscillation of the Duffing oscillator, we first need to solve the given differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The given equation is a second-order differential equation, so we need to convert it into a system of two first-order differential equations. Let y = x', then y' = x'' = cos(t) - 0.1x' - x - x^3. Now we have the following system of first-order differential equations:\n\nx' = y\ny' = cos(t) - 0.1y - x - x^3\n\nwith initial conditions x(0) = 1 and y(0) = x'(0) = 0. Now we can apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a time step of 0.01 to solve this system for 50 seconds.\n\nAfter solving the system of equations, we can analyze the resulting x(t) values to find the period of oscillation. One way to do this is to find the time intervals between successive peaks or troughs in the x(t) values. The period of oscillation can be estimated as the average of these time intervals.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Duffing oscillator is a nonlinear system, and its period of oscillation may not be constant over time. In such cases, it is more appropriate to talk about the average period of oscillation or the range of periods observed in the simulation.\n\nIn conclusion, to find the period of oscillation of the Duffing oscillator, we need to solve the given differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, and then analyze the resulting x(t) values to estimate the period of oscillation."
