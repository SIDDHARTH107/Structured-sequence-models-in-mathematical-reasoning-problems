    "message_2": "Yes, I can help the student find the sine, cosine, and tangent values of a 60-degree angle.\n\nFor a 60-degree angle, we can use the following trigonometric ratios:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of 60 degrees:\nsin(60°) = √3/2\n\n2. Cosine (cos) of 60 degrees:\ncos(60°) = 1/2\n\n3. Tangent (tan) of 60 degrees:\ntan(60°) = sin(60°) / cos(60°) = (√3/2) / (1/2) = √3\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent values of a 60-degree angle are sin(60°) = √3/2, cos(60°) = 1/2, and tan(60°) = √3."
