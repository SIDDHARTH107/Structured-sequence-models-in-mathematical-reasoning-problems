    "message_2": "To find the parameter value of the Mandelbrot set that corresponds to the boundary point of the Julia set with complex coordinates (0.43, 0.52), we need to recall the relationship between the Mandelbrot set and the Julia sets.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f_c(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. The Julia set is defined as the set of complex numbers z for which the function f_c(z) does not diverge when iterated from z.\n\nThe relationship between the Mandelbrot set and the Julia sets is that the parameter value c of the Mandelbrot set corresponds to the boundary point of the Julia set with complex coordinates (x, y).\n\nIn this case, the complex coordinates of the boundary point of the Julia set are (0.43, 0.52). Therefore, the parameter value c of the Mandelbrot set that corresponds to this boundary point is:\n\nc = 0.43 + 0.52i"
