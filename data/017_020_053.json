    "message_2": "To show that there exists an element in G of order 5, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 40. Since 40 = 2^3 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, say H, of order 5. Note that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 2^3 = 8\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 8. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is automatically normal in G. In either case, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup H of order 5.\n\nNow, since H is a group of order 5, which is a prime number, H must be cyclic. Let a be a generator of H, i.e., H = ⟨a⟩. Then, the order of a is 5, as it generates a group of order 5. Thus, there exists an element in G of order 5."
