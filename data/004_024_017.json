    "message_2": "To find dy/dx, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nDifferentiating x^2 with respect to x gives 2x, and differentiating y^2 with respect to x gives 2y(dy/dx) (using the chain rule). So, we have:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we want to find dy/dx when x = 2. We need to find the corresponding value of y when x = 2. We can do this by plugging x = 2 into the original equation:\n\n(2)^2 + y^2 = 10\n4 + y^2 = 10\ny^2 = 6\n\nSince y^2 = 6, we have two possible values for y: y = sqrt(6) and y = -sqrt(6). We will find dy/dx for both cases.\n\nCase 1: y = sqrt(6)\nPlugging x = 2 and y = sqrt(6) into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(2) + 2(sqrt(6))(dy/dx) = 0\n4 + 2(sqrt(6))(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dx:\n\n2(sqrt(6))(dy/dx) = -4\n(dy/dx) = -4 / (2(sqrt(6)))\n(dy/dx) = -2 / sqrt(6)\n\nCase 2: y = -sqrt(6)\nPlugging x = 2 and y = -sqrt(6) into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(2) + 2(-sqrt(6))(dy/dx) = 0\n4 - 2(sqrt(6))(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dx:\n\n-2(sqrt(6))(dy/dx) = -4\n(dy/dx) = 4 / (2(sqrt(6)))\n(dy/dx) = 2 / sqrt(6)\n\nSo, we have two possible values for dy/dx when x = 2: dy/dx = -2 / sqrt(6) and dy/dx = 2 / sqrt(6)."
