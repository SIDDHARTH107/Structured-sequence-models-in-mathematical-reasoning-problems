    "message_2": "The smallest Mersenne prime is 3.\n\nExplanation: A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. Let's check the first few values of n:\n\n- For n = 1: 2^1 - 1 = 1 (1 is not considered a prime number)\n- For n = 2: 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 (3 is a prime number)\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime is 3, which corresponds to n = 2."
