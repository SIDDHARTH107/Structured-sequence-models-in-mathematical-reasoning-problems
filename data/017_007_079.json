    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. If a group G has an element of order n, then there exists a subgroup of G with order n.\n2. If a group G has order p * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, then G has an element of order p and an element of order q.\n3. If a group G has order p^2, where p is a prime number, then G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group Cp^2 or the direct product Cp x Cp.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 6. Since 6 = 2 * 3, by fact 2, G has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3. Then, by fact 1, G has a subgroup of order 2 generated by a, and a subgroup of order 3 generated by b.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\nIf the product of the orders of a and b is equal to the order of G, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6. In this case, G = ⟨a, b⟩, and the elements of G are {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2}, where e is the identity element. The group operation can be defined as the multiplication modulo 6, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\nIf the product of the orders of a and b is not equal to the order of G, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3. In this case, G = ⟨a, b⟩, and the elements of G are {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2}. The group operation can be defined as the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, with a representing a reflection and b representing a rotation. The dihedral group D3 has the following multiplication table:\n\n```\n  e  a  b  b^2  ab  ab^2\ne e  a  b  b^2  ab  ab^2\na a  e  ab ab^2  b   b^2\nb b  ab^2 e  b^2  ab  a\nb^2 ab ab^2  b  a   e\nab ab^2 b  a   e   b^2\nab^2 b^2  a  ab e   b\n```\n\nNow, we will show that there is no other group of order 6 that satisfies this property. Suppose there exists another group G' of order 6 that is not isomorphic to C6 or D3. Then, G' must have an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, by fact 2. Let a' be an element of order 2 and b' be an element of order 3 in G'. Then, G' has a subgroup of order 2 generated by a', and a subgroup of order 3 generated by b'.\n\nSince the order of G' is 6, which is not a prime power, G' cannot be isomorphic to a direct product of its subgroups, by fact 3. Therefore, G' must be a non-abelian group. However, this contradicts the fact that G' has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, which implies that G' is either isomorphic to C6 or D3. Thus, there is no other group of order 6 that satisfies this property."
