    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph with the smallest largest clique. The graph is a 3x3 grid graph. For grid graphs, the treewidth is known to be the smaller dimension minus 1. In this case, the treewidth is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nHere's a tree decomposition of the graph with the largest clique of size 3 (which corresponds to the treewidth of 2):\n\n```\n  1---2---3\n  |   |   |\n  4---5---6\n  |   |   |\n  7---8---9\n```\n\nTree decomposition:\n\n```\n  (1,2,4)---(2,3,5)---(3,6,9)\n    |         |         |\n  (1,4,7)---(2,5,8)---(3,6,9)\n```\n\nEach node in the tree decomposition represents a clique of size 3 in the original graph, and the tree decomposition itself is a tree. The treewidth of the given graph is 2."
