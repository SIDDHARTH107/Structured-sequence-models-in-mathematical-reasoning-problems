    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student is a girl, we need to find the number of girls in the school and divide it by the total number of students.\n\nNumber of girls = 55% of 500 students = 0.55 * 500 = 275 girls\n\nProbability that a randomly selected student is a girl = Number of girls / Total number of students = 275 / 500 = 0.55 or 55%."
