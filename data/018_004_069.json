    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 50 elements, and let B and C be two sets that are complements of set A. If set B has 30 elements, how many elements does set C have?",
    "message_2": "Since B and C are complements of set A, the total number of elements in sets B and C combined should be equal to the number of elements in set A. Therefore, if set B has 30 elements, set C must have 20 elements (50 - 30 = 20)."
