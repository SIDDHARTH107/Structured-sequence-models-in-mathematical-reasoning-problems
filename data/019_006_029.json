    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic Logic is not a subtopic of Mathematics. It is a subfield of Philosophy that deals with the logic of norms, obligations, and permissions. Therefore, it does not involve numerical problems to solve. Can I assist you with anything else related to Mathematics?",
    "message_2": "Please provide a mathematical problem or topic you would like assistance with, and I will be happy to help."
