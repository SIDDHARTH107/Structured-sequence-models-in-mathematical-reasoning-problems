    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 10 vertices and 12 edges. What is the treewidth of G?",
    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of G, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices and m edges has a treewidth upper bound of min(2m/n - 1, n - 1). In this case, n = 10 and m = 12.\n\nApplying the formula, we get:\n\nmin(2 * 12 / 10 - 1, 10 - 1) = min(2.4 - 1, 9) = min(1.4, 9)\n\nSince treewidth is an integer value, we round up the minimum value to the nearest integer:\n\ntreewidth = 2\n\nSo, the treewidth of G is 2."
