    "message_2": "To find the residue of the given function f(z) = (z^3 + 1)/(z^4 - 1) at z = 1+i, we first need to factor the denominator and perform partial fraction decomposition.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^4 - 1 = (z^2 + 1)(z^2 - 1) = (z^2 + 1)(z - 1)(z + 1)\n\nNow, we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = (z^3 + 1)/((z^2 + 1)(z - 1)(z + 1)) = A/(z - 1) + B/(z + 1) + Cz + D/(z^2 + 1)\n\nTo find the coefficients A, B, C, and D, we clear the denominators:\n\nz^3 + 1 = A(z + 1)(z^2 + 1) + B(z - 1)(z^2 + 1) + (Cz + D)(z - 1)(z + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients by plugging in convenient values of z:\n\n1. z = 1: 2^3 + 1 = 9 = 2A(2)(2)\n   A = 9/8\n\n2. z = -1: (-1)^3 + 1 = 0 = -2B(2)\n   B = 0\n\n3. z^2 = -1: z = i or z = -i\n   i^3 + 1 = 0 = (Ci + D)(2i)\n   D = -Ci\n   -i^3 + 1 = 0 = (C(-i) - Ci)(-2i)\n   C = 1/2\n\nNow, we have the partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = (9/8)/(z - 1) + 0/(z + 1) + (1/2)z - (1/2)i/(z^2 + 1)\n\nThe residue at z = 1+i is the coefficient of the term (z - (1+i))^(-1) in the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 1+i. Since there is no term with (z - (1+i))^(-1) in the partial fraction decomposition, the residue at z = 1+i is 0."
