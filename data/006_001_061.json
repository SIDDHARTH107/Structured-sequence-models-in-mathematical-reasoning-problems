    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of trials (coin flips)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (number of heads)\n- p is the probability of success (probability of getting a head)\n- q is the probability of failure (probability of getting a tail)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 5, k = 3, p = 0.5 (since the probability of getting a head is 1/2), and q = 0.5 (since the probability of getting a tail is also 1/2).\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk:\n5C3 = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n= 5! / (3!2!)\n= (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)(2*1))\n= 120 / (6*2)\n= 120 / 12\n= 10\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\nP(X = 3) = (10) * (0.5^3) * (0.5^(5-3))\n= 10 * (0.125) * (0.25)\n= 10 * 0.03125\n= 0.3125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
