    "message_1": "A car is traveling on a straight road and its position at time t is given by s(t) = 5t^2 - 30t + 10, where s is measured in meters and t is measured in seconds. What is the average velocity of the car on the interval [1, 4]? Use the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals to find the value of t that makes the car's instant velocity equal to its average velocity over this time interval.",
    "message_2": "To find the average velocity of the car on the interval [1, 4], we need to find the difference in position at t = 4 and t = 1, and then divide by the time interval (4 - 1).\n\ns(4) = 5(4)^2 - 30(4) + 10 = 80 - 120 + 10 = -30\ns(1) = 5(1)^2 - 30(1) + 10 = 5 - 30 + 10 = -15\n\nThe difference in position is s(4) - s(1) = -30 - (-15) = -15 meters.\n\nThe time interval is 4 - 1 = 3 seconds.\n\nThe average velocity is the difference in position divided by the time interval:\n\nAverage velocity = -15 / 3 = -5 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the instant velocity function by taking the derivative of the position function:\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(5t^2 - 30t + 10)/dt = 10t - 30\n\nTo find the value of t that makes the car's instant velocity equal to its average velocity over this time interval, we set v(t) equal to the average velocity:\n\n-5 = 10t - 30\n\nAdding 30 to both sides:\n\n25 = 10t\n\nDividing by 10:\n\nt = 2.5\n\nSo, the value of t that makes the car's instant velocity equal to its average velocity over the time interval [1, 4] is t = 2.5 seconds."
