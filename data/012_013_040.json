    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G with 4 vertices and 3 edges, we first need to identify the structure of the graph. Since there are 4 vertices and 3 edges, the graph must be a tree. The possible structure for this graph is a star graph with one central vertex connected to the other three vertices.\n\nNow, let's find the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of this graph, where k is the number of colors.\n\n1. The central vertex can be colored in k ways.\n2. Each of the three outer vertices can be colored in (k-1) ways, as they cannot have the same color as the central vertex.\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is given by:\n\nP(G, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-1) * (k-1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^3"
