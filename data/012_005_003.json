    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. Let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. G is connected, which means there is a path between any pair of vertices.\n2. G has 7 vertices and 9 edges.\n\nSince G is connected and has 7 vertices, the minimum number of edges it can have is 6 (forming a tree). However, G has 9 edges, which means there are 3 additional edges. These additional edges can only decrease the diameter of G, as they create shortcuts between vertices.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario for the diameter, which is when G is a tree. In this case, the longest path would be a straight line connecting all 7 vertices, resulting in a diameter of 6.\n\nNow, let's add the 3 additional edges to G. Each additional edge can reduce the diameter by at most 1, as it can connect two vertices that were previously 2 edges apart. Therefore, the diameter of G can be reduced to at most 6 - 3 = 3.\n\nSo, the diameter of G is 3."
