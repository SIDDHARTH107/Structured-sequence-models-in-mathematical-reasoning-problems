The summaries of the scores for these tests for past employees in each group are as follows:\n\nSuitable applicants: \n- Math: Mean = 80, Standard Deviation = 10 \n- Verbal: Mean = 85, Standard Deviation = 5 \n- Logic: Mean = 75, Standard Deviation = 8 \n\nUnsuitable applicants: \n- Math: Mean = 60, Standard Deviation = 15 \n- Verbal: Mean = 70, Standard Deviation = 10 \n- Logic: Mean = 65, Standard Deviation = 12 \n\nIf a new job applicant scores 70 in math, 80 in verbal, and 70 in logic, should the company classify the applicant as suitable or unsuitable based on the three assessment tests? Use discriminant analysis to make your decision.",
    "message_2": "To use discriminant analysis, we will calculate the discriminant function for both suitable and unsuitable groups and compare the values. The discriminant function is given by:\n\nD = (X - M) * (S^-1) * (X - M)^T - ln(det(S))\n\nWhere:\n- D is the discriminant function\n- X is the vector of the applicant's scores\n- M is the vector of the group's mean scores\n- S is the covariance matrix of the group's scores (assuming equal covariance matrices for both groups)\n- ln(det(S)) is the natural logarithm of the determinant of the covariance matrix\n\nSince we are assuming equal covariance matrices for both groups, we can ignore the last term (ln(det(S))) in the discriminant function, as it will be the same for both groups.\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant function for both suitable and unsuitable groups:\n\nApplicant's scores (X): [70, 80, 70]\n\nSuitable group:\nMean scores (M_suitable): [80, 85, 75]\nStandard deviations (SD_suitable): [10, 5, 8]\n\nUnsuitable group:\nMean scores (M_unsuitable): [60, 70, 65]\nStandard deviations (SD_unsuitable): [15, 10, 12]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the difference between the applicant's scores and the mean scores for each group:\n\nDifference_suitable = X - M_suitable = [70-80, 80-85, 70-75] = [-10, -5, -5]\nDifference_unsuitable = X - M_unsuitable = [70-60, 80-70, 70-65] = [10, 10, 5]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the inverse of the covariance matrix. Since we are assuming equal covariance matrices for both groups, we can use the average of the standard deviations for each test:\n\nAverage SDs: [(10+15)/2, (5+10)/2, (8+12)/2] = [12.5, 7.5, 10]\n\nWe will assume that the tests are uncorrelated, so the covariance matrix will be a diagonal matrix with the variances (SD^2) on the diagonal:\n\nCovariance matrix (S): \n[[156.25, 0, 0],\n [0, 56.25, 0],\n [0, 0, 100]]\n\nThe inverse of a diagonal matrix is another diagonal matrix with the reciprocals of the diagonal elements:\n\nInverse covariance matrix (S^-1): \n[[1/156.25, 0, 0],\n [0, 1/56.25, 0],\n [0, 0, 1/100]]\n\nNow we can calculate the discriminant functions for both groups:\n\nD_suitable = Difference_suitable * S^-1 * Difference_suitable^T\n           = [-10, -5, -5] * [[1/156.25, 0, 0], [0, 1/56.25, 0], [0, 0, 1/100]] * [-10, -5, -5]^T\n           = 0.64 + 0.44 + 0.25\n           = 1.33\n\nD_unsuitable = Difference_unsuitable * S^-1 * Difference_unsuitable^T\n             = [10, 10, 5] * [[1/156.25, 0, 0], [0, 1/56.25, 0], [0, 0, 1/100]] * [10, 10, 5]^T\n             = 0.64 + 1.78 + 0.25\n             = 2.67\n\nSince D_suitable < D_unsuitable, the applicant is closer to the suitable group, and we can classify the applicant as suitable based on the three assessment tests."
