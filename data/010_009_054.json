    "message_1": "Let's consider a regular hexagon with side length 4 units. Using triangulations and subdivisions, determine the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed by dividing the hexagon into smaller triangular sections.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the number of non-overlapping triangles in the regular hexagon, we can connect each vertex to the center of the hexagon, which will divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles. Then, we can further subdivide each of these equilateral triangles into four smaller equilateral triangles by connecting the midpoints of their sides.\n\nSo, for each of the six larger equilateral triangles, we create four smaller triangles, resulting in a total of 6 * 4 = 24 non-overlapping triangles."
