    "message_2": "Let $A$ be the abelian variety of dimension 2 defined over $\\mathbb{C}$, and let $E$ be an elliptic curve such that $E \\times E \\cong A$. We want to determine the number of points in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, where $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a finite field with $p$ elements and $p$ is a prime number.\n\nSince $E \\times E \\cong A$, the number of points in $A(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is equal to the number of points in $(E \\times E)(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. By the Kunneth formula, we have:\n\n$A(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\cong E(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\times E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$.\n\nNow, let $N_p$ denote the number of points in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. Then the number of points in $A(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is $N_p^2$. \n\nTo determine $N_p$, we can use Hasse's theorem, which states that for an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, the number of points in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ satisfies the following inequality:\n\n$|N_p - (p+1)| \\le 2\\sqrt{p}$.\n\nUnfortunately, Hasse's theorem only gives us a bound on the number of points, and we cannot determine the exact value of $N_p$ without more information about the elliptic curve $E$. However, we can say that the number of points in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is in the range $(p+1) \\pm 2\\sqrt{p}$."
