    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nSo, for f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx + d(4x)/dx - d(5)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 2x^(2-1) + 4 * 1x^(1-1) - 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0)\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) + 4\n\nf'(2) = 12 + 4\n\nf'(2) = 16\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 at x = 2 is 16."
