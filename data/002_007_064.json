    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8cm and the length of its two parallel sides are 12cm and 18cm respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 12cm and 18cm, and the height is 8cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 18) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (30) * 8\nArea = 15 * 8\nArea = 120 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 120 square centimeters."
