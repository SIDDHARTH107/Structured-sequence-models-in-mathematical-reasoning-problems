    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient, which we will use to update our guess for the minimum value of f(x).\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 3 with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 4x + 5\n\nNow, we will perform 5 iterations of gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.1, starting with an initial guess of x0 = 0.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - learning_rate * f'(x0)\nx1 = 0 - 0.1 * (4 * 0 + 5)\nx1 = -0.5\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - learning_rate * f'(x1)\nx2 = -0.5 - 0.1 * (4 * -0.5 + 5)\nx2 = -0.5 - 0.1 * 3\nx2 = -0.8\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - learning_rate * f'(x2)\nx3 = -0.8 - 0.1 * (4 * -0.8 + 5)\nx3 = -0.8 - 0.1 * 1\nx3 = -0.9\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = x3 - learning_rate * f'(x3)\nx4 = -0.9 - 0.1 * (4 * -0.9 + 5)\nx4 = -0.9 - 0.1 * (-0.6)\nx4 = -0.84\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = x4 - learning_rate * f'(x4)\nx5 = -0.84 - 0.1 * (4 * -0.84 + 5)\nx5 = -0.84 - 0.1 * 0.64\nx5 = -0.908\n\nAfter 5 iterations, our best guess for the minimum value of f(x) is at x = -0.908. Now, we can plug this value back into the original function to find the minimum value of f(x):\n\nf(-0.908) = 2 * (-0.908)^2 + 5 * (-0.908) + 3\nf(-0.908) â‰ˆ 0.1808\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) after 5 iterations of gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.1 is approximately 0.1808."
