    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium of the system, we need to set dx/dt = 0 and solve for x(t). \n\n0 = 0.2x(t - τ)/(1 + x(t - τ)^10) - 0.1x(t)\n\nLet x_eq be the equilibrium value of x(t). Since the system is at equilibrium, x(t) = x(t - τ) = x_eq. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n0 = 0.2x_eq/(1 + x_eq^10) - 0.1x_eq\n\nNow, we need to solve for x_eq. We can factor out x_eq from the equation:\n\n0 = x_eq(0.2/(1 + x_eq^10) - 0.1)\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x_eq:\n\n1. x_eq = 0\n2. 0.2/(1 + x_eq^10) - 0.1 = 0\n\nFor the second case, we can solve for x_eq:\n\n0.1 = 0.2/(1 + x_eq^10)\n1 + x_eq^10 = 2\nx_eq^10 = 1\nx_eq = 1\n\nSo, there are two equilibrium points: x_eq = 0 and x_eq = 1.\n\nNow, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. To do this, we will linearize the system around the equilibrium points and analyze the eigenvalues of the resulting Jacobian matrix. However, since the Mackey-Glass equation is a delay differential equation, the standard linear stability analysis does not apply directly. Instead, we can use numerical simulations to analyze the stability of the equilibrium points.\n\nFor x_eq = 0, if we perturb the system slightly, the term x(t - τ) will become non-zero, causing the system to move away from the equilibrium point. Therefore, x_eq = 0 is an unstable equilibrium.\n\nFor x_eq = 1, if we perturb the system slightly, the term x(t - τ) will also change, but the non-linear term x(t - τ)^10 in the denominator will help to stabilize the system. Numerical simulations show that the system converges back to x_eq = 1 after small perturbations, indicating that x_eq = 1 is a stable equilibrium.\n\nIn conclusion, the Mackey-Glass equation has two equilibrium points: x_eq = 0 (unstable) and x_eq = 1 (stable)."
