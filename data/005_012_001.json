    "message_1": "A survey was conducted to determine the average height of students in a school. Out of a total of 1000 students in the school, a sample of 100 students were selected and their heights were measured. The average height of the sample was found to be 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. Find the margin of error for the sample mean at 95% confidence level.",
    "message_2": "To find the margin of error for the sample mean at a 95% confidence level, we will use the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = Z * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size)\n\nwhere Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is approximately 1.96.\n\nGiven:\nSample Size (n) = 100 students\nStandard Deviation (σ) = 10 cm\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (10 / √100)\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (10 / 10)\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 1\nMargin of Error = 1.96 cm\n\nSo, the margin of error for the sample mean at a 95% confidence level is approximately 1.96 cm."
