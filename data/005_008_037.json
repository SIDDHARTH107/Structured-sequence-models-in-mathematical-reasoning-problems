The sales data is as follows:\n\n| Month | Sales |\n|-------|-------|\n| Jan-19 | 10    |\n| Feb-19 | 12    |\n| Mar-19 | 15    |\n| Apr-19 | 14    |\n| May-19 | 13    |\n| Jun-19 | 16    |\n| Jul-19 | 18    |\n| Aug-19 | 20    |\n| Sep-19 | 19    |\n| Oct-19 | 22    |\n| Nov-19 | 24    |\n| Dec-19 | 25    |\n| Jan-20 | 30    |\n| Feb-20 | 32    |\n| Mar-20 | 35    |\n| Apr-20 | 34    |\n| May-20 | 33    |\n| Jun-20 | 36    |\n| Jul-20 | 38    |\n| Aug-20 | 40    |\n| Sep-20 | 39    |\n| Oct-20 | 42    |\n| Nov-20 | 44    |\n| Dec-20 | 45    |\n\nWhat is the arithmetic mean of the sales data for the two-year period? What is the median of the sales data for the two-year period? What is the range of the sales data for the two-year period? What is the variance of the sales data for the two-year period? What is the standard deviation of the sales data for the two-year period?",
    "message_2": "To find the arithmetic mean, we need to add up all the sales numbers and divide by the total number of months (24).\n\nMean = (10 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 16 + 18 + 20 + 19 + 22 + 24 + 25 + 30 + 32 + 35 + 34 + 33 + 36 + 38 + 40 + 39 + 42 + 44 + 45) / 24\nMean = 684 / 24\nMean = 28.5\n\nTo find the median, we need to order the sales numbers from smallest to largest and find the middle value. Since there are 24 months, we will take the average of the 12th and 13th values.\n\nOrdered Sales: 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45\nMedian = (25 + 30) / 2\nMedian = 27.5\n\nThe range is the difference between the highest and lowest sales numbers.\n\nRange = 45 - 10\nRange = 35\n\nTo find the variance, we need to calculate the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\n1. Calculate the differences from the mean for each sales number.\n2. Square each difference.\n3. Add up all the squared differences.\n4. Divide the sum by the total number of months (24).\n\nVariance = Σ(x - mean)² / n\nVariance = (18.5² + 16.5² + 13.5² + 14.5² + 15.5² + 12.5² + 10.5² + 8.5² + 9.5² + 6.5² + 4.5² + 3.5² + 1.5² + 0.5² + 6.5² + 5.5² + 4.5² + 7.5² + 9.5² + 11.5² + 10.5² + 13.5² + 15.5² + 16.5²) / 24\nVariance = (342.25 + 272.25 + 182.25 + 210.25 + 240.25 + 156.25 + 110.25 + 72.25 + 90.25 + 42.25 + 20.25 + 12.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 42.25 + 30.25 + 20.25 + 56.25 + 90.25 + 132.25 + 110.25 + 182.25 + 240.25 + 272.25) / 24\nVariance = 3468 / 24\nVariance = 144.5\n\nTo find the standard deviation, we need to take the square root of the variance.\n\nStandard Deviation = √144.5\nStandard Deviation ≈ 12.02\n\nSo, the arithmetic mean is 28.5, the median is 27.5, the range is 35, the variance is 144.5, and the standard deviation is approximately 12.02."
