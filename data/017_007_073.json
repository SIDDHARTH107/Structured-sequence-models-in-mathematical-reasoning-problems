    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 6, and let a be an element of G with the highest possible order. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Since a has the highest possible order, the order of a is either 3 or 6.\n\nCase 1: The order of a is 6.\nIf the order of a is 6, then G is generated by a, i.e., G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is cyclic and isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: The order of a is 3.\nIf the order of a is 3, then the subgroup generated by a is H = {e, a, a^2}. Since the order of H is 3 and the order of G is 6, there must be another element b in G that is not in H. Let b be such an element. The order of b cannot be 1 (since b is not the identity element) or 3 (otherwise, b would be in H). Thus, the order of b must be 2.\n\nNow, consider the element ab. Since a and b have different orders, ab cannot be equal to either a or b. Also, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2, and since the order of a is 3 and the order of b is 2, a^2 ≠ e and b^2 = e, so (ab)^2 = a^2 ≠ e. Thus, the order of ab is not 1 or 2. The order of ab cannot be 3 either, because if it were, then ab would be in H, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the order of ab must be 6.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our assumption that a has the highest possible order in G. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possibilities, we conclude that G must be cyclic and isomorphic to C6, or G is non-cyclic and isomorphic to D3."
