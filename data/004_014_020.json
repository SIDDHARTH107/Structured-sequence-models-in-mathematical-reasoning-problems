    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cylindrical tank when it's completely filled, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 meters and the height (h) is 10 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = π(4²)(10)\nV = π(16)(10)\nV = 160π\n\nSince π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV ≈ 160 × 3.14159\nV ≈ 502.65482\n\nSo, the cylindrical tank can hold approximately 502.65 cubic meters of water when it's completely filled."
