    "message_2": "To analyze the behavior of the network using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transforms of the input signals f(t) and g(t). The Fourier transform is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nG(ω) = ∫[g(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) and G(ω) are the Fourier transforms of f(t) and g(t), respectively, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nLet's find the Fourier transforms of f(t) and g(t):\n\n1. Fourier transform of f(t) = 3cos(2πt):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[3cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite cos(2πt) as:\ncos(2πt) = (1/2)[e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt)]\n\nSo, F(ω) = (3/2) ∫[(e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\nF(ω) = (3/2) [∫[e^(j(2π-ω)t) dt] + ∫[e^(-j(2π+ω)t) dt]]\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\nF(ω) = (3/2) [ (1/(j(2π-ω))) (e^(j(2π-ω)t)) |_(−∞)^(∞) + (1/(-j(2π+ω))) (e^(-j(2π+ω)t)) |_(−∞)^(∞)]\n\nThe integral will be zero for all ω except ω = ±2π. Therefore, we can represent F(ω) as:\nF(ω) = (3/2) [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)]\n\n2. Fourier transform of g(t) = 2sin(2πt):\n\nG(ω) = ∫[2sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite sin(2πt) as:\nsin(2πt) = (1/2j)[e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)]\n\nSo, G(ω) = (1/j) ∫[(e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\nG(ω) = (1/j) [∫[e^(j(2π-ω)t) dt] - ∫[e^(-j(2π+ω)t) dt]]\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\nG(ω) = (1/j) [ (1/(j(2π-ω))) (e^(j(2π-ω)t)) |_(−∞)^(∞) - (1/(-j(2π+ω))) (e^(-j(2π+ω)t)) |_(−∞)^(∞)]\n\nThe integral will be zero for all ω except ω = ±2π. Therefore, we can represent G(ω) as:\nG(ω) = (1/j) [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nNow that we have the Fourier transforms of the input signals, we need more information about the network itself (e.g., its transfer function or impulse response) to determine the signal at the output."
