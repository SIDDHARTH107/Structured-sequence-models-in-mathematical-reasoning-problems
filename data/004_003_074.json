    "message_1": "A metal box is to be made with a square base and an open top such that its volume is 128 cubic inches. If the cost of the metal is $0.06 per square inch, what is the cost of the least expensive box?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and h be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * h\n\nSince the volume is 128 cubic inches, we have:\n\n128 = x^2 * h\n\nWe want to minimize the cost of the box, so we need to minimize the surface area of the box. The surface area of the box is given by:\n\nA = x^2 + 4xh\n\nWe can solve the volume equation for h:\n\nh = 128 / x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nA = x^2 + 4x(128 / x^2)\n\nA = x^2 + 512 / x\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = 2x - 512 / x^2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2x^3 - 512 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nx^3 = 256\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 4\n\nNow, substitute x = 4 back into the equation for h:\n\nh = 128 / 4^2\n\nh = 128 / 16\n\nh = 8\n\nSo, the dimensions of the least expensive box are 4 inches by 4 inches by 8 inches. Now, we can find the surface area of this box:\n\nA = 4^2 + 4(4)(8)\n\nA = 16 + 128\n\nA = 144 square inches\n\nFinally, we can find the cost of the least expensive box:\n\nCost = 144 * $0.06\n\nCost = $8.64"
