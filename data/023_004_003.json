    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = 4t^2 - 2t + 5, we'll use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nSo, let's compute the Fourier transform of f(t) = 4t^2 - 2t + 5:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} (4t^2 - 2t + 5) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nWe can split this integral into three separate integrals:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 4t^2 * e^(-jωt) dt - ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 2t * e^(-jωt) dt + ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 5 * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNow, let's solve each integral separately:\n\n1) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 4t^2 * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = 4t^2 and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 8t dt and v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\n∫_{-∞}^{∞} 4t^2 * e^(-jωt) dt = [-4t^2/(jω) * e^(-jωt)]_{-∞}^{∞} - ∫_{-∞}^{∞} (-8t/(jω)) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThe first term in the brackets goes to zero as t goes to infinity or minus infinity. So, we are left with the second term:\n\n-(-8/(jω)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} t * e^(-jωt) dt = (8/(jω)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} t * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNow, we have the same integral as in the second term of the original problem. So, let's solve it and multiply the result by (8/(jω)) later.\n\n2) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 2t * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nAgain, we can use integration by parts. Let u = 2t and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 2 dt and v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\n∫_{-∞}^{∞} 2t * e^(-jωt) dt = [-2t/(jω) * e^(-jωt)]_{-∞}^{∞} - ∫_{-∞}^{∞} (-2/(jω)) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThe first term in the brackets goes to zero as t goes to infinity or minus infinity. So, we are left with the second term:\n\n-(-2/(jω)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) dt = (2/(jω)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThe integral ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) dt is zero for ω ≠ 0 and is infinite for ω = 0. So, the result is:\n\n(2/(jω)) * δ(ω), where δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, let's go back to the first integral and multiply the result by (8/(jω)):\n\n(8/(jω)) * (2/(jω)) * δ(ω) = (16/(ω^2)) * δ(ω)\n\n3) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 5 * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThis integral is straightforward:\n\n5 ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) dt = 5 * 2π * δ(ω)\n\nNow, let's sum up the results of the three integrals:\n\nF(ω) = (16/(ω^2)) * δ(ω) + (2/(jω)) * δ(ω) + 5 * 2π * δ(ω)\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = 4t^2 - 2t + 5."
