They choose a prime number p = 23 and a primitive root g = 5. Alice chooses a secret number a = 7, and Bob chooses a secret number b = 11. Calculate the shared secret key they will use for encryption.",

Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B over the insecure channel.\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key as K = B^a mod p.\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key as K = A^b mod p.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. Alice computes A = 5^7 mod 23 = 3\n2. Bob computes B = 5^11 mod 23 = 18\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B: A = 3, B = 18\n4. Alice computes K = 18^7 mod 23 = 2\n5. Bob computes K = 3^11 mod 23 = 2\n\nThe shared secret key they will use for encryption is K = 2."
