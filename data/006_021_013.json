    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one hurricane occurring in the next 5 years, we can first find the probability of no hurricanes occurring in the next 5 years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no hurricane occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.07 = 0.93.\n\nThe probability of no hurricanes occurring in 5 consecutive years is (0.93)^5.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one hurricane occurring in the next 5 years:\n\nP(at least one hurricane) = 1 - P(no hurricanes)\nP(at least one hurricane) = 1 - (0.93)^5\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nP(at least one hurricane) ≈ 1 - 0.69834 ≈ 0.30166\n\nSo, the probability of at least one hurricane occurring in the next 5 years is approximately 0.30166 or 30.166%."
