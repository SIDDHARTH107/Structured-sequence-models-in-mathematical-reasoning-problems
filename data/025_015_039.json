    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface S at the point (1,1,1), we first need to find the gradient of the function F(x,y,z) = x^2 - y^2z - 2.\n\nThe gradient of F is given by the vector (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z), where the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = -2yz\n∂F/∂z = -y^2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the gradient at the point (1,1,1):\n\n∂F/∂x(1,1,1) = 2(1) = 2\n∂F/∂y(1,1,1) = -2(1)(1) = -2\n∂F/∂z(1,1,1) = -(1)^2 = -1\n\nSo, the gradient of F at (1,1,1) is the vector (2, -2, -1).\n\nNow, we can use the gradient to find the equation of the tangent plane at (1,1,1). The equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n\nF_x(x_0, y_0, z_0)(x - x_0) + F_y(x_0, y_0, z_0)(y - y_0) + F_z(x_0, y_0, z_0)(z - z_0) = 0\n\nPlugging in the gradient values and the point (1,1,1), we get:\n\n2(x - 1) - 2(y - 1) - 1(z - 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x - 2y - z + 1 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface S at the point (1,1,1) is:\n\n2x - 2y - z + 1 = 0"
