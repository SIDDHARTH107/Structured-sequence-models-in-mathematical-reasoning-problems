    "message_1": "What is the value of the first non-zero Fourier coefficient of the solution to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with periodic boundary conditions on the interval [0, 2π] when the initial condition is the Gaussian function:\n\nu(x, 0) = exp{-10*sin(x/2)^2} \n\nand the wave number k = 2?",
    "message_2": "The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is a partial differential equation given by:\n\nu_t + u*u_x + u_xx + u_xxxx = 0\n\nwhere u(x, t) is a function of space x and time t, and the subscripts denote partial derivatives. To find the first non-zero Fourier coefficient of the solution, we need to expand the initial condition u(x, 0) in a Fourier series.\n\nThe initial condition is given by:\n\nu(x, 0) = exp{-10*sin(x/2)^2}\n\nThe Fourier series expansion of a function f(x) with periodic boundary conditions on the interval [0, 2π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ [a_n * cos(n * k * x) + b_n * sin(n * k * x)]\n\nwhere k = 2π/L, L = 2π (in this case), and the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * k * x) dx] from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * k * x) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nSince the initial condition u(x, 0) is an even function (symmetric about the y-axis), all the b_n coefficients will be zero. Thus, we only need to compute the a_n coefficients.\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[exp{-10*sin(x/2)^2} * cos(n * k * x) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nTo find the first non-zero Fourier coefficient, we need to find the smallest n for which a_n ≠ 0. Unfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution, so we cannot find an exact expression for a_n. However, we can approximate the value of a_n numerically.\n\nUsing numerical integration techniques (e.g., Simpson's rule, trapezoidal rule, or a numerical software package), we can compute the values of a_n for different values of n and find the first non-zero coefficient."
