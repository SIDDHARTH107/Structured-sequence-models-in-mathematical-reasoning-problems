    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate z from the first two equations by adding them:\n\n(x + 2y + z) + (2x - y - z) = 7 + (-1)\n3x + y = 6  (1)\n\nNext, we can eliminate z from the second and third equations by adding them:\n\n(2x - y - z) + (3x + 4y - z) = -1 + 12\n5x + 3y = 11  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n3x + y = 6\n5x + 3y = 11\n\nWe can eliminate y by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by -1 and then adding them:\n\n(9x + 3y) + (-5x - 3y) = 18 + (-11)\n4x = 7\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 7/4\n\nNext, we can substitute the value of x back into equation (1) to find the value of y:\n\n3(7/4) + y = 6\n21/4 + y = 6\ny = 6 - 21/4\ny = (24 - 21)/4\ny = 3/4\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of x and y back into any of the original equations to find the value of z. We will use the first equation:\n\n(7/4) + 2(3/4) + z = 7\n7/4 + 6/4 + z = 7\n13/4 + z = 7\nz = 7 - 13/4\nz = (28 - 13)/4\nz = 15/4\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 7/4, y = 3/4, and z = 15/4."
