    "message_1": "Consider a car traveling on a straight road at a constant speed of 60 mph. The driver needs to brake in order to stop the car at a traffic light located 150 feet away. The maximum braking force that the car can produce is 20,000 pounds. What is the minimum time required for the car to come to a complete stop without skidding?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the deceleration of the car and then use the equations of motion to find the time it takes to come to a complete stop.\n\nFirst, let's convert the speed from miles per hour to feet per second:\n60 mph * (5280 feet/mile) / (3600 seconds/hour) = 88 feet/second\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of the car. We can use the formula for force:\nForce = mass * acceleration\n\nWe are given the maximum braking force (20,000 pounds) and we need to find the deceleration (negative acceleration) the car experiences when braking. However, we don't have the mass of the car. \n\nUnfortunately, without the mass of the car, we cannot determine the deceleration and thus cannot find the minimum time required for the car to come to a complete stop without skidding."
