    "message_1": "A company conducted a market survey on the buying behavior of their product and found that the probability of a customer buying their product without any advertisement is 0.2. If the company spends $5000 on advertisements, the probability of a customer buying their product increases to 0.35. What is the expected return on investment if the profit per unit sold is $10 and the company has 1000 units available for sale?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected return on investment (ROI), we need to find the difference in profit with and without the advertisement, and then compare it to the cost of the advertisement.\n\nFirst, let's find the expected number of units sold without advertisement:\nProbability of a customer buying without advertisement = 0.2\nNumber of units available for sale = 1000\nExpected units sold without advertisement = 0.2 * 1000 = 200 units\n\nNow, let's find the expected number of units sold with advertisement:\nProbability of a customer buying with advertisement = 0.35\nExpected units sold with advertisement = 0.35 * 1000 = 350 units\n\nNext, let's find the difference in the number of units sold due to the advertisement:\nDifference in units sold = 350 - 200 = 150 units\n\nNow, let's find the additional profit generated due to the advertisement:\nProfit per unit sold = $10\nAdditional profit due to advertisement = 150 units * $10/unit = $1500\n\nFinally, let's calculate the return on investment (ROI):\nCost of advertisement = $5000\nROI = (Additional profit - Cost of advertisement) / Cost of advertisement\nROI = ($1500 - $5000) / $5000 = -$3500 / $5000 = -0.7 or -70%\n\nThe expected return on investment for the advertisement is -70%, which means the company is expected to lose 70% of their investment in the advertisement."
