    "message_2": "To compute the connection matrix at the point (1,1,1) on the sphere of radius 3, we first need to find the local coordinates and basis vectors for the tangent space at this point. \n\nLet's use spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) for the sphere, where r is the radial distance, θ is the polar angle, and φ is the azimuthal angle. The sphere equation in spherical coordinates is given by:\n\nr = 3\n\nNow, we need to convert the point (1,1,1) from Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates:\n\nr = √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3\nθ = arccos(1/√3) ≈ 1.23095942 radians\nφ = arctan(1/1) = π/4 radians\n\nSince the sphere has a constant radius, we only need to consider the angular coordinates (θ, φ) for the tangent space. The basis vectors for the tangent space in spherical coordinates are:\n\n∂/∂θ = (-3sinθcosφ, -3sinθsinφ, 3cosθ)\n∂/∂φ = (-3cosθsinφ, 3cosθcosφ, 0)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these basis vectors at the point (1,1,1) in spherical coordinates:\n\n∂/∂θ = (-3sin(1.23095942)cos(π/4), -3sin(1.23095942)sin(π/4), 3cos(1.23095942))\n∂/∂φ = (-3cos(1.23095942)sin(π/4), 3cos(1.23095942)cos(π/4), 0)\n\nNext, we need to compute the covariant derivatives of these basis vectors with respect to the angular coordinates. However, since the sphere is a symmetric space, the connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols) vanish, and the connection matrix is simply the zero matrix:\n\n[0, 0]\n[0, 0]\n\nSo, the connection matrix at the point (1,1,1) on the sphere with radius 3 is the zero matrix."
