    "message_2": "To find the minimum vertex cover of this graph, we need to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set.\n\nWe can start by selecting vertex 3, which covers edges (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), and (3,5). Then, we can select vertex 5, which covers edges (4,5), (5,6), and (5,7). Finally, we need to cover edge (6,7), so we select vertex 6. \n\nThe minimum vertex cover of this graph is {3, 5, 6} with a size of 3."
