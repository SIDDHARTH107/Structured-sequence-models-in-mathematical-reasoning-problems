    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for the mass-spring system, we can use the following equation:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ω * t + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position at time t, A is the amplitude of the oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nWe are given the natural frequency, which is the angular frequency ω = 2 rad/s. The mass of the system is m = 0.5 kg, and the spring constant is k = 4 N/m. The initial displacement is 2 cm, which is 0.02 m.\n\nSince the system is released from its initial displacement, the initial velocity is 0. To find the phase angle φ, we can use the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.02 m\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(φ) = 0\n\nSince v(0) = 0, we know that sin(φ) = 0, which means φ = 0 or φ = π. Since x(0) is positive, we choose φ = 0.\n\nNow we have all the necessary information to write the equation of motion:\n\nx(t) = 0.02 * cos(2 * t)\n\nThis is the equation of motion for the mass-spring system with the given parameters and initial conditions."
