    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base with dimensions of 5 cm by 8 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nThe base area can be found by multiplying the length and width of the base:\n\nBase area = 5 cm * 8 cm = 40 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 40 cm² * 12 cm = (40/3) * 12 cm³ = 160 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
