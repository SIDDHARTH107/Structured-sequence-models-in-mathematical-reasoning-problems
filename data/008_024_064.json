    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate z from the first and second equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -4 and add it to the second equation multiplied by 1.\n\n-4(3x + 2y + z) = -4(10)\n(2x - y + 4z) = 2\n\n-12x - 8y - 4z = -40\n2x - y + 4z = 2\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(-12x + 2x) + (-8y - y) = -40 + 2\n-10x - 9y = -38\n\nNow, we have a new equation:\n\n-10x - 9y = -38 (1)\n\nNext, we will eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the third equation multiplied by 1.\n\n-2(3x + 2y + z) = -2(10)\n(5x + 3y + 2z) = 19\n\n-6x - 4y - 2z = -20\n5x + 3y + 2z = 19\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(-6x + 5x) + (-4y + 3y) = -20 + 19\n-x - y = -1\n\nNow, we have another new equation:\n\n-x - y = -1 (2)\n\nNow, we will solve equation (2) for x:\n\nx = -1 + y (3)\n\nNow, substitute equation (3) into equation (1):\n\n-10(-1 + y) - 9y = -38\n10 - 10y - 9y = -38\n-19y = -48\n\nNow, divide by -19:\n\ny = 48 / 19\ny = 2.526 (approximately)\n\nNow, substitute the value of y into equation (3):\n\nx = -1 + 2.526\nx = 1.526 (approximately)\n\nFinally, substitute the values of x and y into the first original equation to find the value of z:\n\n3x + 2y + z = 10\n3(1.526) + 2(2.526) + z = 10\n4.578 + 5.052 + z = 10\n9.63 + z = 10\n\nNow, subtract 9.63 from both sides:\n\nz = 10 - 9.63\nz = 0.37 (approximately)\n\nSo, the approximate solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx ≈ 1.526\ny ≈ 2.526\nz ≈ 0.37"
