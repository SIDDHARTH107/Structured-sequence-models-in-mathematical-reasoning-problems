    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2sin^2(x) - 3sin(x) - 1 = 0, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in sin(x). Let y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 - 3y - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -3, and c = -1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(2)(-1))) / (2(2))\ny = (3 ± √(9 + 8)) / 4\ny = (3 ± √17) / 4\n\nSo, we have two possible values for y (sin(x)):\n\ny1 = (3 + √17) / 4\ny2 = (3 - √17) / 4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that correspond to these values of y (sin(x)) in the range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π.\n\nFor y1:\n\nsin(x) = (3 + √17) / 4\nx = arcsin((3 + √17) / 4)\n\nHowever, (3 + √17) / 4 is greater than 1, which is not possible for sin(x). Therefore, there is no solution for x in this case.\n\nFor y2:\n\nsin(x) = (3 - √17) / 4\nx = arcsin((3 - √17) / 4)\n\nSince (3 - √17) / 4 is within the range of -1 to 1, we can find the value of x:\n\nx ≈ arcsin((3 - √17) / 4) ≈ 0.65 radians\n\nBut we also need to consider the other angle in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π that has the same sine value. This angle can be found by subtracting the first angle from π:\n\nx2 = π - x1 ≈ π - 0.65 ≈ 2.49 radians\n\nSo, the two solutions for x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π are:\n\nx ≈ 0.65 radians and x ≈ 2.49 radians."
