    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on the ground. From a distance of 30 meters, you observe that the angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is 60 degrees. What is the height of the flagpole to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the distance from the observer to the flagpole (adjacent side) is 30 meters, and the height of the flagpole (opposite side) is what we want to find.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 30\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3, so:\n\n√3 = height / 30\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 30 * √3 ≈ 51.96\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the flagpole is approximately 52 meters."
