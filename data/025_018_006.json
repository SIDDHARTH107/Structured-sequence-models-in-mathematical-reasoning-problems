    "message_2": "To find the intersection number of L with X using Mori theory, we will first need to find the divisor classes of both L and X in the Picard group of P^2. Then, we will compute their intersection product.\n\n1. Divisor classes in the Picard group:\n\nThe Picard group of P^2 is isomorphic to Z, generated by the class of a line. Let [L] denote the class of a line in the Picard group.\n\nThe line L is defined by x=y, which is a line in P^2. Therefore, its divisor class is [L] in the Picard group.\n\nThe projective variety X is defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0. This is a cubic curve in P^2. The degree of a curve is the same as the degree of its defining equation, so the degree of X is 3. The divisor class of a curve of degree d in P^2 is d times the class of a line, so the divisor class of X is 3[L] in the Picard group.\n\n2. Intersection product:\n\nNow we need to compute the intersection product of L and X. In the Picard group of P^2, the intersection product of two divisors is given by the product of their degrees. Since the degree of L is 1 and the degree of X is 3, their intersection product is 1 * 3 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the intersection number of L with X is 3."
