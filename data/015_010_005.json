The Poincaré map is a discrete-time dynamical system obtained by observing the continuous-time system at fixed intervals. In this case, we can observe the values of xn at each iteration.\n\nFrom the values of xn, we can see that the values do not seem to settle into a repeating pattern. This is an indication that the system is chaotic. For r = 3.5, the logistic map is known to exhibit chaotic behavior, which is consistent with our observation."
