    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by iteratively replacing each line segment with a smaller \"bump\" composed of four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial length) * (4/3)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 and the order is 4. So, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve of order 4 is:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (4/3)^4 = 1 * (256/81) = 256/81 â‰ˆ 3.1605"
