Assume the wire is operating in free space with no nearby objects affecting its radiation pattern. Use Fourier transform to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the total power radiated electromagnetically from the wire, we need to first find the power spectral density (PSD) of the current waveform using the Fourier transform. Then, we can integrate the PSD over all frequencies to obtain the total power radiated.\n\nThe sinusoidal current waveform is given by:\ni(t) = 5 * sin(2 * π * 50 * t)\n\nFirst, we need to find the Fourier transform of the current waveform. The Fourier transform of a sinusoidal function is given by a pair of Dirac delta functions:\n\nI(f) = A * [δ(f - f0) + δ(f + f0)]\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the sinusoid, f0 is the frequency, and δ(f) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nIn our case, A = 5/2 and f0 = 50 Hz. So, the Fourier transform of the current waveform is:\n\nI(f) = (5/2) * [δ(f - 50) + δ(f + 50)]\n\nNow, we need to find the power spectral density (PSD) of the current waveform. The PSD is given by the square of the magnitude of the Fourier transform:\n\nPSD(f) = |I(f)|^2\n\nFor the Dirac delta function, |δ(f)|^2 = δ(f). Therefore, the PSD of the current waveform is:\n\nPSD(f) = (5/2)^2 * [δ(f - 50) + δ(f + 50)]\n\nTo find the total power radiated, we need to integrate the PSD over all frequencies:\n\nP_total = ∫(PSD(f) * R_rad) df\n\nwhere R_rad is the radiation resistance of the wire. For a sinusoidal current distribution on a straight wire, the radiation resistance is given by:\n\nR_rad = 20 * π^2 * (l/λ)^2\n\nwhere l is the length of the wire and λ is the wavelength of the radiation. Since the wire is operating in free space, the speed of light c = 3 * 10^8 m/s. The frequency f0 = 50 Hz, so the wavelength λ = c / f0 = (3 * 10^8) / 50 = 6 * 10^6 m.\n\nThe length of the wire l = 2π units. Therefore, the radiation resistance is:\n\nR_rad = 20 * π^2 * (2π / 6 * 10^6)^2 ≈ 2.77 * 10^(-11) Ω\n\nNow, we can integrate the PSD over all frequencies:\n\nP_total = ∫(PSD(f) * R_rad) df = (5/2)^2 * R_rad * [∫δ(f - 50) df + ∫δ(f + 50) df]\n\nSince the integral of the Dirac delta function is 1, the total power radiated is:\n\nP_total = (5/2)^2 * 2.77 * 10^(-11) * (1 + 1) ≈ 3.45 * 10^(-10) W\n\nSo, the total power radiated electromagnetically from the wire is approximately 3.45 * 10^(-10) watts."
