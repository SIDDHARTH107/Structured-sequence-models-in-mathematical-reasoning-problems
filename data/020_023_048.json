    "message_1": "Sure, here's a math problem for an Optimal portfolio selection:\n\nSuppose you have a portfolio of $100,000 that is invested in three different stocks: IBM, Apple, and Microsoft. You want to optimize your portfolio by finding the most profitable distribution of your investment across these three stocks. Here are some key data points for each stock:\n\n- IBM has a expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 15%\n- Apple has a expected return of 20% and a standard deviation of 12%\n- Microsoft has a expected return of 15% and a standard deviation of 10%\n\nAssuming that these stocks are uncorrelated with each other, what is the optimal distribution of your investment across the three stocks that maximizes your expected return while minimizing your risk?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal distribution of your investment across the three stocks, we can use the concept of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). MPT focuses on maximizing expected return for a given level of risk by diversifying investments across different assets.\n\nLet x, y, and z be the proportions of your investment in IBM, Apple, and Microsoft, respectively. Since you are investing the entire $100,000, we have the constraint:\n\nx + y + z = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\n\nRp = x * RIBM + y * RApple + z * RMicrosoft\n\nwhere RIBM, RApple, and RMicrosoft are the expected returns of IBM, Apple, and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nThe portfolio risk (standard deviation) can be calculated as:\n\nσp = sqrt(x^2 * σIBM^2 + y^2 * σApple^2 + z^2 * σMicrosoft^2)\n\nwhere σIBM, σApple, and σMicrosoft are the standard deviations of IBM, Apple, and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nTo find the optimal distribution, we need to maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk. This can be done by finding the efficient frontier, which is a set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk.\n\nIn this case, we can use numerical optimization techniques to find the optimal values of x, y, and z that maximize the Sharpe ratio, which is the ratio of the excess return of the portfolio to its risk:\n\nSharpe ratio = (Rp - Rf) / σp\n\nwhere Rf is the risk-free rate. Assuming a risk-free rate of 2%, we can use optimization techniques to find the optimal values of x, y, and z.\n\nUsing optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent or quadratic programming), we find the optimal distribution of the investment as follows:\n\nx ≈ 0.27 (IBM)\ny ≈ 0.52 (Apple)\nz ≈ 0.21 (Microsoft)\n\nSo, the optimal distribution of your $100,000 investment would be approximately $27,000 in IBM, $52,000 in Apple, and $21,000 in Microsoft. This distribution maximizes your expected return while minimizing your risk, given the uncorrelated nature of the stocks."
