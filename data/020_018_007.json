    "message_1": "A company must decide how much to invest in advertising their new product. If they spend $10,000, they have a 60% chance of selling 1,500 units at a profit of $20 per unit, and a 40% chance of selling only 1,000 units at a profit of $10 per unit. On the other hand, if they spend $20,000, they have a 80% chance of selling 2,000 units at a profit of $20 per unit, and a 20% chance of selling only 1,500 units at a profit of $10 per unit. What amount should the company spend on advertising to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine which advertising investment maximizes the expected profit, we need to calculate the expected profit for each option.\n\nOption 1: Spend $10,000 on advertising\nExpected profit = (probability of selling 1,500 units * profit from selling 1,500 units) + (probability of selling 1,000 units * profit from selling 1,000 units) - cost of advertising\nExpected profit = (0.6 * (1,500 * $20)) + (0.4 * (1,000 * $10)) - $10,000\nExpected profit = (0.6 * $30,000) + (0.4 * $10,000) - $10,000\nExpected profit = $18,000 + $4,000 - $10,000\nExpected profit = $12,000\n\nOption 2: Spend $20,000 on advertising\nExpected profit = (probability of selling 2,000 units * profit from selling 2,000 units) + (probability of selling 1,500 units * profit from selling 1,500 units) - cost of advertising\nExpected profit = (0.8 * (2,000 * $20)) + (0.2 * (1,500 * $10)) - $20,000\nExpected profit = (0.8 * $40,000) + (0.2 * $15,000) - $20,000\nExpected profit = $32,000 + $3,000 - $20,000\nExpected profit = $15,000\n\nComparing the expected profits, the company should spend $20,000 on advertising to maximize their expected profit, as it results in an expected profit of $15,000 compared to the $12,000 expected profit from spending $10,000 on advertising."
