    "message_1": "A certain type of technological failure occurs in 2% of a specific system's components. If there are 1500 components in the system, what is the probability that at least 30 of them will fail?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k failures\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of failure (0.02)\n- n is the total number of components (1500)\n- k is the number of failures\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 30 failures, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 30, 31, ..., 1500.\n\nP(X >= 30) = 1 - P(X < 30) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 29\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 29 and subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least 30 failures.\n\nUsing a calculator or programming language that supports binomial probability calculations, we can find:\n\nP(X >= 30) ≈ 0.9922\n\nSo, the probability that at least 30 components will fail is approximately 99.22%."
