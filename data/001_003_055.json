    "message_2": "First, we'll solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the second equation for x:\n\nx - 2y = 7\nx = 2y + 7\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n2(2y + 7) + 3y = 12\n\nDistribute the 2:\n\n4y + 14 + 3y = 12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n7y + 14 = 12\n\nSubtract 14 from both sides:\n\n7y = -2\n\nDivide by 7:\n\ny = -2/7\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = 2(-2/7) + 7\n\nx = -4/7 + 7\n\nTo add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 7:\n\nx = (-4 + 49)/7\n\nx = 45/7\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 45/7 and y = -2/7."
