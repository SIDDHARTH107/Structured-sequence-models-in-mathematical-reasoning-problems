    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. First, let's analyze the given information.\n\nWe have a graph with 7 vertices and 11 edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with n vertices is given by the formula:\n\nmax_edges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nFor our graph with 7 vertices:\n\nmax_edges = 7 * (7 - 1) / 2 = 7 * 6 / 2 = 21\n\nSince our graph has 11 edges, it is not a complete graph (which would have 21 edges). Now, let's consider the minimum degree of any vertex in the graph. By the Pigeonhole Principle, we can calculate the minimum degree as follows:\n\nmin_degree = ceil(total_edges / total_vertices) = ceil(11 / 7) = 2\n\nThis means that every vertex in the graph has at least 2 edges connected to it. Now, let's analyze the diameter of the graph.\n\n1. If the graph is a tree (acyclic), the diameter can be found by finding the longest path between any two vertices. In this case, the diameter would be the number of vertices in the longest path minus one. Since the graph has 7 vertices, the maximum diameter for a tree would be 6.\n\n2. If the graph is not a tree (contains cycles), the diameter will be less than or equal to the maximum diameter of a tree with the same number of vertices. In this case, the diameter would be less than or equal to 6.\n\nSince the graph has 11 edges, which is more than the number of edges in a tree with 7 vertices (6 edges), the graph must contain cycles. Therefore, the diameter of the graph is less than or equal to 6.\n\nWithout more information about the specific connections between vertices, we cannot determine the exact diameter of the graph. However, we can conclude that the diameter of the graph is less than or equal to 6."
