    "message_1": "A company is planning to organize a team-building event for its employees. The event will involve a ropes course, where participants must climb across a series of ropes and platforms to reach the end. The ropes can only hold a maximum weight of 200 pounds each, and each employee weighs between 120 and 180 pounds. \n\nIf there are 10 employees in total, what is the maximum number of ropes that can be used in the course so that all employees can participate without any ropes breaking?",
    "message_2": "To ensure that all employees can participate without any ropes breaking, we need to consider the heaviest possible employee weight, which is 180 pounds. Since each rope can hold a maximum weight of 200 pounds, only one employee can be on a rope at a time.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of ropes that can be used in the course is equal to the number of employees, which is 10. This way, each employee can be on a separate rope, ensuring that no rope will break due to exceeding its weight limit."
