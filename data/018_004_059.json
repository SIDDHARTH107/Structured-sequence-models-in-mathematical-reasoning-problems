    "message_1": "Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} be the universal set and A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} be a subset of U. Determine the complement of A, denoted by A', and verify if it is unique.",
    "message_2": "The complement of A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. To find A', we can subtract the elements of A from U:\n\nA' = U - A = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's verify if A' is unique. The complement of A is unique because it is directly related to the specific set A and the universal set U. Since A and U are fixed in this problem, there can only be one unique complement of A, which is A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}."
