    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by 1, and then add the two equations.\n\nSecond equation * 3:\n3(x - 2y + 5z) = 3(5)\n3x - 6y + 15z = 15\n\nThird equation * 1:\n1(3x + y - z) = 1(-2)\n3x + y - z = -2\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n3x - 6y + 15z = 15\n+\n3x + y - z = -2\n-------------------\n6x - 5y + 14z = 13\n\nNow, we will eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by 2, and then add the two equations.\n\nFirst equation * 3:\n3(-2x + 3y + 4z) = 3(10)\n-6x + 9y + 12z = 30\n\nThird equation * 2:\n2(3x + y - z) = 2(-2)\n6x + 2y - 2z = -4\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n-6x + 9y + 12z = 30\n+\n6x + 2y - 2z = -4\n-------------------\n11y + 10z = 26\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n6x - 5y + 14z = 13\n11y + 10z = 26\n\nWe will now eliminate y from these two equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 5, and then subtract the second equation from the first equation.\n\nFirst equation * 11:\n11(6x - 5y + 14z) = 11(13)\n66x - 55y + 154z = 143\n\nSecond equation * 5:\n5(11y + 10z) = 5(26)\n55y + 50z = 130\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n66x - 55y + 154z = 143\n-\n55y + 50z = 130\n-------------------\n66x + 104z = 273\n\nNow, divide the equation by 2:\n33x + 52z = 136.5\n\nNow we have an equation with two variables (x and z):\n33x + 52z = 136.5\n\nTo find the value of x, we can substitute the value of z from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n6x - 5y + 14z = 13\n6x - 5y + 14(136.5 - 33x) = 13\n\nNow, solve for x:\n6x - 5y + 1911 - 462x = 13\n-456x + 5y = -1898\nx = (-1898 + 5y) / 456\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation 11y + 10z = 26:\n11y + 10(136.5 - 33((-1898 + 5y) / 456)) = 26\n\nSolve for y:\n11y + 1365 - 330((-1898 + 5y) / 456) = 26\n11y - 330((-1898 + 5y) / 456) = -1339\n-330((-1898 + 5y) / 456) = -1339 - 11y\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 456:\n-330(-1898 + 5y) = -609384 - 5088y\n101640 - 1650y = -609384 - 5088y\n\nNow, add 1650y to both sides:\n-3438y = -711024\n\nNow, divide by -3438:\ny = 206.5\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation x = (-1898 + 5y) / 456:\nx = (-1898 + 5(206.5)) / 456\nx = (-1898 + 1032.5) / 456\nx = 134.5 / 456\nx = 0.295\n\nNow, substitute the values of x and y back into the equation z = 136.5 - 33x:\nz = 136.5 - 33(0.295)\nz = 136.5 - 9.735\nz = 126.765\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = 0.295\ny = 206.5\nz = 126.765"
