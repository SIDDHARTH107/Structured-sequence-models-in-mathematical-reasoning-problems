    "message_2": "To differentiate both sides of the equation x^2 + y^2 = 25 with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFirst, differentiate x^2 with respect to x:\nd(x^2)/dx = 2x\n\nNext, differentiate y^2 with respect to x. Since y is a function of x, we'll use the chain rule:\nd(y^2)/dx = 2y * dy/dx\n\nNow, we have the derivatives of both sides of the equation:\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nWe want to find dy/dx when x = 3. To do this, we first need to find the corresponding value of y. We can use the original equation to find this:\n\n(3)^2 + y^2 = 25\n9 + y^2 = 25\ny^2 = 16\ny = Â±4\n\nThere are two possible values for y: 4 and -4. Now, we'll find dy/dx for each case.\n\nCase 1: y = 4\n2(3) + 2(4)(dy/dx) = 0\n6 + 8(dy/dx) = 0\n8(dy/dx) = -6\ndy/dx = -6/8 = -3/4\n\nCase 2: y = -4\n2(3) + 2(-4)(dy/dx) = 0\n6 - 8(dy/dx) = 0\n8(dy/dx) = 6\ndy/dx = 6/8 = 3/4\n\nSo, when x = 3, dy/dx can be either -3/4 or 3/4, depending on whether y = 4 or y = -4."
