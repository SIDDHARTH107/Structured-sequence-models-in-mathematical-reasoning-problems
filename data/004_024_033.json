    "message_2": "To find the derivative dy/dx of the implicit function x^2 + y^2 + 2y = 3, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\nd(x^2)/dx + d(y^2)/dx + d(2y)/dx = d(3)/dx\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) + 2(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we want to find dy/dx at the point (1, -1/2). We can plug in the coordinates into the equation:\n\n2(1) + 2(-1/2)(dy/dx) + 2(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2 - dy/dx + 2(dy/dx) = 0\n\nCombining the terms with dy/dx, we have:\n\ndy/dx = 2\n\nSo, the derivative dy/dx at the point (1, -1/2) is 2."
