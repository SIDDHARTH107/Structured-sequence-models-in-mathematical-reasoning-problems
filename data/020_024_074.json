    "message_1": "A company produces a product at a cost of $50 per unit. The company can sell the product for $100 per unit when the demand is 500 units per month. However, the demand decreases by 5 units for every $1 increase in price. \n\nWhat is the optimal selling price for the product to maximize the company's profit? How many units of the product should be produced and sold at this price to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of $1 increases in price. Then the selling price per unit will be 100 + x dollars, and the demand will be 500 - 5x units per month.\n\nThe revenue for the company is the product of the selling price and the number of units sold: R(x) = (100 + x)(500 - 5x).\n\nThe profit is the revenue minus the cost of producing the units: P(x) = R(x) - 50(500 - 5x).\n\nFirst, we need to find the revenue function R(x):\n\nR(x) = (100 + x)(500 - 5x) = 50000 - 500x + 500x - 5x^2 = -5x^2 + 50000.\n\nNow, we can find the profit function P(x):\n\nP(x) = -5x^2 + 50000 - 25000 + 250x = -5x^2 + 250x + 25000.\n\nTo find the optimal selling price, we need to maximize the profit function P(x). To do this, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of P(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = -10x + 250 = 0.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 25.\n\nSo, the optimal selling price is 100 + 25 = $125 per unit.\n\nNow, we can find the number of units that should be produced and sold at this price to maximize the profit:\n\nDemand = 500 - 5x = 500 - 5(25) = 500 - 125 = 375 units.\n\nTherefore, the company should produce and sell 375 units of the product at a selling price of $125 per unit to maximize its profit."
