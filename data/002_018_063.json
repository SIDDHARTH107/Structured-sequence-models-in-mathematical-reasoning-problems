    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, its diameter is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nSubstitute the radius (r = 5 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 125 cm^3\nV = 500/3 * π cm^3 ≈ 523.6 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
