    "message_1": "Solve the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 7 \n4x + 6y = 14 \n\nDoes this system of equations have a solution or not? If it has one, what is it? If it does not have a solution, explain why.",
    "message_2": "This system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. The reason is that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n(2x + 3y) * 2 = 7 * 2\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nSince the second equation is a multiple of the first equation, they are essentially the same line. In this case, the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, as any point on the line 2x + 3y = 7 will satisfy both equations."
