Define the Fourier transform F(k) of f(x) as:\n\nF(k) = ∫2π0 f(x) e^(-ikx) dx,\n\nwhere i = √-1 is the imaginary unit. Show that F(k) is a continuous function of k, and that F(0) = 2π times the average (or mean) value of f(x) over one period.",
    "message_2": "To show that F(k) is a continuous function of k, we need to show that for any k₀, the limit as k approaches k₀ of F(k) exists and is equal to F(k₀). Let's consider the difference F(k) - F(k₀):\n\nF(k) - F(k₀) = ∫[0, 2π] f(x) (e^(-ikx) - e^(-ik₀x)) dx\n\nNow, let's take the limit as k approaches k₀:\n\nlim (k → k₀) [F(k) - F(k₀)] = lim (k → k₀) ∫[0, 2π] f(x) (e^(-ikx) - e^(-ik₀x)) dx\n\nSince f(x) is continuous and periodic, we can interchange the limit and the integral:\n\n= ∫[0, 2π] f(x) lim (k → k₀) (e^(-ikx) - e^(-ik₀x)) dx\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the exponential function is continuous:\n\n= ∫[0, 2π] f(x) (e^(-ik₀x) - e^(-ik₀x)) dx = 0\n\nThus, the limit as k approaches k₀ of F(k) - F(k₀) is 0, which implies that F(k) is continuous.\n\nNow, let's find F(0):\n\nF(0) = ∫[0, 2π] f(x) e^(-i0x) dx = ∫[0, 2π] f(x) dx\n\nThe average (or mean) value of f(x) over one period is given by:\n\n(1/(2π)) ∫[0, 2π] f(x) dx\n\nMultiplying the average value by 2π, we get:\n\n2π (1/(2π)) ∫[0, 2π] f(x) dx = ∫[0, 2π] f(x) dx = F(0)\n\nThus, F(0) is equal to 2π times the average value of f(x) over one period."
