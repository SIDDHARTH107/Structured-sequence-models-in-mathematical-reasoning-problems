    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: A and B, with production costs of $50 and $80 per unit, respectively. The demand for product A is 400 units, while the demand for product B is 300 units. The company has a budget of $30,000 for production costs. Using the whale optimization algorithm, what is the maximum profit that the company can make?",
    "message_2": "The whale optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales. However, it is not necessary to use such a complex algorithm for this problem, as it can be solved using simple linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue for product A is given by x * price_A, and for product B is given by y * price_B. However, we do not have the selling prices for products A and B. Assuming the company wants to maximize the profit, we can still find the optimal production quantities within the given budget.\n\nThe production cost constraint is:\n\n50x + 80y ≤ 30,000\n\nThe demand constraints are:\n\nx ≤ 400\ny ≤ 300\n\nSince x and y represent the number of units produced, they must be non-negative:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo maximize the production within the given budget, we can use the corner-point method. The feasible region is formed by the intersection of the constraints. The corner points are:\n\n(0, 0), (0, 300), (400, 0), and (375, 62.5)\n\nNow, we need to check which of these points maximizes the production cost without exceeding the budget. The total cost at each corner point is:\n\n(0, 0): 50(0) + 80(0) = 0\n(0, 300): 50(0) + 80(300) = 24,000\n(400, 0): 50(400) + 80(0) = 20,000\n(375, 62.5): 50(375) + 80(62.5) = 30,000\n\nThe point (375, 62.5) maximizes the production cost without exceeding the budget. However, we cannot produce a fraction of a product, so we need to round down the number of product B units to 62. The new total cost is:\n\n50(375) + 80(62) = 29,960\n\nThe maximum profit cannot be determined without knowing the selling prices of products A and B. However, the optimal production quantities within the given budget are 375 units of product A and 62 units of product B."
