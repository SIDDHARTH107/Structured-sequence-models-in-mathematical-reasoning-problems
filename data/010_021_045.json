    "message_2": "To show that $c_1(X) \\cdot [\\omega] = 0$, we will use the adjunction formula. The adjunction formula relates the first Chern class of a 4-manifold X, the first Chern class of a surface S embedded in X, and the self-intersection number of S:\n\n$c_1(X) \\cdot [S] = 2g(S) - 2 + S^2$,\n\nwhere $g(S)$ is the genus of the surface S and $S^2$ is the self-intersection number of S.\n\nNow, let S be a surface in X such that its PoincarÃ© dual is represented by $\\omega^2$. Since $\\omega^2$ represents a PD class, we have $S^2 = 0$. Moreover, since X is symplectic, we have $[\\omega] \\cdot [S] > 0$. \n\nUsing the adjunction formula, we get:\n\n$c_1(X) \\cdot [\\omega] = 2g(S) - 2$.\n\nSince $[\\omega] \\cdot [S] > 0$, we must have $g(S) > 0$. However, since $S^2 = 0$, the adjunction formula implies that $c_1(X) \\cdot [\\omega] = 0$. Thus, we have shown that $c_1(X) \\cdot [\\omega] = 0$.\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $c_1(X)^2 \\cdot [\\omega]$. To do this, we will use the fact that the triple intersection number is symmetric, i.e., $c_1(X)^2 \\cdot [\\omega] = [\\omega] \\cdot c_1(X)^2$. \n\nSince $c_1(X) \\cdot [\\omega] = 0$, we have:\n\n$[\\omega] \\cdot c_1(X)^2 = [\\omega] \\cdot (c_1(X) \\cdot c_1(X)) = (c_1(X) \\cdot [\\omega]) \\cdot c_1(X) = 0 \\cdot c_1(X) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $c_1(X)^2 \\cdot [\\omega] = 0$."
