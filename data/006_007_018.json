    "message_1": "Suppose the current stock price of XYZ Corp. is $100 per share. The probability that the stock price will increase by 20% in the next month is 0.4, while the probability that it will decrease by 10% is 0.6. What is the expected value of the stock price at the end of next month?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the stock price at the end of next month, we need to consider both possible outcomes (increase by 20% and decrease by 10%) and their respective probabilities.\n\nIf the stock price increases by 20%, the new price will be:\n$100 + (0.20 × $100) = $100 + $20 = $120\n\nIf the stock price decreases by 10%, the new price will be:\n$100 - (0.10 × $100) = $100 - $10 = $90\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing the results:\n\nExpected value = (Probability of increase × Increased price) + (Probability of decrease × Decreased price)\nExpected value = (0.4 × $120) + (0.6 × $90)\nExpected value = $48 + $54\nExpected value = $102\n\nSo, the expected value of the stock price at the end of next month is $102."
