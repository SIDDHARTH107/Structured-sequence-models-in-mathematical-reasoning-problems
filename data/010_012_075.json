    "message_2": "Let M be a manifold diffeomorphic to the sphere S^2, and let φ: M → S^2 be a diffeomorphism between M and S^2. We can define a smooth function f: M → R by composing φ with a smooth function g: S^2 → R that attains its maximum but not its minimum on S^2. \n\nConsider the stereographic projection of S^2 onto the plane R^2. Let N be the north pole of S^2, and let π: S^2 - {N} → R^2 be the stereographic projection. The function π is a smooth bijection between S^2 - {N} and R^2. \n\nNow, let's define a smooth function g: S^2 → R as follows:\n\ng(x) = { 0, if x = N\n       { ||π(x)||^2, otherwise\n\nThe function g is smooth on S^2 - {N}, and it is also smooth at N since the limit of g as x approaches N exists and is equal to 0. Thus, g is a smooth function on S^2.\n\nThe function g attains its maximum at N, since for any x in S^2 - {N}, we have ||π(x)||^2 < ||π(N)||^2 = 0. However, g does not attain its minimum on S^2, since for any x in S^2, we have g(x) ≥ 0, but g(N) = 0, and there is no x in S^2 such that g(x) < 0.\n\nNow, define the function f: M → R by f(x) = g(φ(x)). The function f is smooth since it is a composition of smooth functions. Moreover, f attains its maximum at x₀ ∈ M such that φ(x₀) = N, since f(x₀) = g(N) = 0, and for any x ∈ M, we have f(x) = g(φ(x)) ≤ g(N) = 0. However, f does not attain its minimum on M, since for any x ∈ M, we have f(x) = g(φ(x)) ≥ 0, but there is no x ∈ M such that f(x) < 0.\n\nThus, we have constructed a smooth function f: M → R that attains its maximum but not its minimum on M."
