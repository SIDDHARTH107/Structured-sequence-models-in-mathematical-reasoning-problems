    "message_1": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, two travelers are asked to declare a price for a lost suitcase that was valued between $50 and $1000. The traveler who declares the lower value gets that amount as compensation, while the other traveler gets the declared amount plus a bonus. The bonus is equal to the difference between the two declared values if both values are within $10 of each other, and otherwise is zero. \n\nAssuming both travelers are rational, what is the best price for each traveler to declare?",
    "message_2": "To find the best price for each traveler to declare, we can use backward induction. We start by considering the highest possible value, $1000, and work our way down.\n\nIf both travelers declare $1000, they both get $1000, as the difference is $0, which is within $10. However, if one traveler declares $990, they would get $990 + $10 = $1000, while the other traveler would get $990. So, it's better to declare $990.\n\nNow, if both travelers declare $990, they both get $990. But if one traveler declares $980, they would get $980 + $10 = $990, while the other traveler would get $980. So, it's better to declare $980.\n\nWe can continue this process, and we'll find that each traveler has an incentive to declare a lower value than the other. Eventually, we reach the lowest possible value, $50.\n\nAt this point, if both travelers declare $50, they both get $50. If one traveler declares a higher value, they would still get only $50, as the difference would be greater than $10, and the bonus would be zero. Therefore, there is no incentive for either traveler to declare a value higher than $50.\n\nSo, assuming both travelers are rational, the best price for each traveler to declare is $50."
