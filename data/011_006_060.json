    "message_1": "Consider a dice with 6 faces, numbered 1 to 6. How many ways can you obtain a sum of 10 by rolling the dice 5 times?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of generating functions. Let's represent the dice rolls as a polynomial where the coefficient of x^n represents the number of ways to obtain a sum of n by rolling the dice.\n\nFor a single dice roll, the generating function is:\n\nf(x) = x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6\n\nSince we are rolling the dice 5 times, we need to find the coefficient of x^10 in the expansion of f(x)^5:\n\nf(x)^5 = (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^5\n\nExpanding this polynomial and finding the coefficient of x^10, we get:\n\nCoefficient of x^10 in f(x)^5 = 126\n\nTherefore, there are 126 ways to obtain a sum of 10 by rolling the dice 5 times."
