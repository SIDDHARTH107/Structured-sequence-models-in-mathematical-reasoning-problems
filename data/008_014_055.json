    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  6 -2 |\n    | 1 -2  4 |\n    | 2  1 -1 |\n\nb = |  6 |\n    | -7 |\n    |  3 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition algorithm (such as Gram-Schmidt, Householder, or Givens rotations), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.82 -0.41  0.41 |\n    | -0.27  0.82  0.51 |\n    | -0.55  0.41 -0.72 |\n\nR = | -3.67 -4.08  3.27 |\n    |  0   -4.08  1.64 |\n    |  0     0    3.08 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^Tb, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nQ^Tb = |  1.64 |\n       | -4.08 |\n       | -6.16 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb using back substitution:\n\nR = | -3.67 -4.08  3.27 | x = |  1.64 |\n    |  0   -4.08  1.64 |     | -4.08 |\n    |  0     0    3.08 |     | -6.16 |\n\nSolving for x, y, and z, we get:\n\nx ≈ 1.00\ny ≈ 1.00\nz ≈ -2.00\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.00, y = 1.00, and z = -2.00 (rounded to 2 decimal places)."
