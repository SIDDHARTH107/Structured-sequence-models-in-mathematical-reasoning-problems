    "message_1": "Suppose a person travels to their workplace by car and there is a 20% chance of encountering traffic on any given day. What is the probability that they will encounter traffic on at least 3 out of 5 working days this week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of encountering traffic on exactly k days out of n days\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of encountering traffic on a single day (20% or 0.2)\n- n is the total number of days (5 working days)\n- k is the number of days with traffic\n\nWe want to find the probability of encountering traffic on at least 3 out of 5 working days, so we need to calculate the probabilities for k = 3, k = 4, and k = 5, and then add them together.\n\n1. For k = 3:\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.2^3 * 0.8^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.008 * 0.64\nP(X = 3) = 0.0512\n\n2. For k = 4:\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.2^4 * 0.8^1\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.0016 * 0.8\nP(X = 4) = 0.0064\n\n3. For k = 5:\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * 0.2^5 * 0.8^0\nP(X = 5) = 1 * 0.00032 * 1\nP(X = 5) = 0.00032\n\nNow, we add the probabilities for k = 3, k = 4, and k = 5:\n\nP(at least 3 out of 5 days) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\nP(at least 3 out of 5 days) = 0.0512 + 0.0064 + 0.00032\nP(at least 3 out of 5 days) = 0.05792\n\nSo, the probability of encountering traffic on at least 3 out of 5 working days this week is approximately 5.792%."
