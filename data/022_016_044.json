    "message_2": "To find the Riemann map that maps the unit disk onto the region enclosed by the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1$, we can use the conformal map that maps the unit disk to an ellipse. This map is given by the following formula:\n\n$$f(z) = 2z\\sqrt{1 - z^2}$$\n\nNow, we can find the image of the points $i$, $-i$, and $1$ under this map.\n\n1. For $z = i$:\n\n$$f(i) = 2i\\sqrt{1 - i^2} = 2i\\sqrt{1 + 1} = 2i\\sqrt{2}$$\n\n2. For $z = -i$:\n\n$$f(-i) = 2(-i)\\sqrt{1 - (-i)^2} = -2i\\sqrt{1 + 1} = -2i\\sqrt{2}$$\n\n3. For $z = 1$:\n\n$$f(1) = 2(1)\\sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 2\\sqrt{0} = 0$$\n\nSo, the image of the points $i$, $-i$, and $1$ under the Riemann map are $2i\\sqrt{2}$, $-2i\\sqrt{2}$, and $0$, respectively."
