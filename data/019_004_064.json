Then, we will show that if $\\mathcal{T}$ is a model of $F$, then $F$ is satisfiable.\n\n1. If $F$ is satisfiable, then $\\mathcal{T}$ is a model of $F$:\n\nAssume that $F$ is satisfiable. This means that there exists a model $\\mathcal{M}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models F$. Now, we will show that $\\mathcal{T}$ is also a model of $F$.\n\nConsider the formula $F = \\Box(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond(q \\land r))$. We need to show that for every state $s \\in S$, if $p \\in L(s)$, then there exists a state $s' \\in S$ such that $(s, s') \\in R$ and $q \\land r \\in L(s')$.\n\nLet's analyze the states in $\\mathcal{T}$:\n\n- For $s_0$: We have $p \\in L(s_0)$. There is a transition $(s_0, s_1) \\in R$. However, $q \\land r \\notin L(s_1)$, since $L(s_1) = \\{r\\}$ and $q \\notin L(s_1)$. But notice that $\\neg q \\in L(s_0)$, so $p \\rightarrow \\Diamond(q \\land r)$ is vacuously true in $s_0$ because $p \\rightarrow \\Diamond(q \\land r)$ is equivalent to $\\neg p \\lor \\Diamond(q \\land r)$, and $\\neg q \\in L(s_0)$ implies $\\neg p \\in L(s_0)$.\n\n- For $s_1$: We have $p \\notin L(s_1)$, so $p \\rightarrow \\Diamond(q \\land r)$ is vacuously true in $s_1$.\n\nSince $p \\rightarrow \\Diamond(q \\land r)$ is true in both states, we have $\\mathcal{T} \\models F$.\n\n2. If $\\mathcal{T}$ is a model of $F$, then $F$ is satisfiable:\n\nAssume that $\\mathcal{T}$ is a model of $F$. This means that for every state $s \\in S$, if $p \\in L(s)$, then there exists a state $s' \\in S$ such that $(s, s') \\in R$ and $q \\land r \\in L(s')$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{T}$ is a model of $F$, it means that $F$ is true in $\\mathcal{T}$. Therefore, $F$ is satisfiable, as there exists a model (in this case, $\\mathcal{T}$) in which $F$ is true.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that $F$ is satisfiable if and only if the transition system $\\mathcal{T}$ is a model of $F$."
