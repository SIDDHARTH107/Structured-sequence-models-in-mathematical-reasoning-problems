    "message_2": "The maximum modulus principle states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) in a bounded domain and continuous on its closure, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 1 is a polynomial, so it is holomorphic everywhere. The closed disk {z : |z - 1| ≤ 2} is a bounded domain with continuous closure. Therefore, we can apply the maximum modulus principle to find the maximum value of |f(z)| on the boundary of the disk.\n\nThe boundary of the disk is given by the circle |z - 1| = 2. Let z = 1 + 2e^(iθ), where θ is the angle in polar coordinates. Then, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (1 + 2e^(iθ))^2 - 2(1 + 2e^(iθ)) + 1\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nf(z) = 4e^(2iθ) + 4e^(iθ) + 1 - 4e^(iθ) - 4 + 1\nf(z) = 4e^(2iθ) - 3\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of |f(z)|:\n\n|f(z)| = |4e^(2iθ) - 3|\n\nUsing the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n|f(z)| ≤ |4e^(2iθ)| + |-3|\n|f(z)| ≤ 4 + 3\n|f(z)| ≤ 7\n\nTo find when the maximum is attained, we can set:\n\n4e^(2iθ) - 3 = 7\n\nSolving for e^(2iθ), we get:\n\ne^(2iθ) = (7 + 3) / 4\ne^(2iθ) = 10 / 4\ne^(2iθ) = 5 / 2\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n2iθ = ln(5/2)\n\nDividing by 2i, we get:\n\nθ = (1/2i) * ln(5/2)\n\nThis value of θ corresponds to the point on the boundary of the disk where the maximum value of |f(z)| is attained. Therefore, the maximum value of |f(z)| on the closed disk {z : |z - 1| ≤ 2} is 7."
