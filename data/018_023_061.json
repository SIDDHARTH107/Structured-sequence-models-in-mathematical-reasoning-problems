    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B (denoted as A △ B). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and C, denoted as (A △ B) × C:\n\n(A △ B) × C = {1, 4} × {3, 4, 5} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and C, denoted as B × C:\n\nB × C = {2, 3, 4} × {3, 4, 5} = {(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B × C), denoted as A △ (B × C). Since A is a set of single elements and (B × C) is a set of ordered pairs, their intersection is empty, and their symmetric difference is simply the union of the two sets:\n\nA △ (B × C) = A ∪ (B × C) = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) × C and A △ (B × C) are not equal:\n\n(A △ B) × C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\nA △ (B × C) = {1, 2, 3, (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nThis demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product. In other words, (A △ B) × C ≠ A △ (B × C)."
