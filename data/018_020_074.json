    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A ∆ B). The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∩ B = {5, 9}\nA ∪ B = {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}\n\nA ∆ B = {3, 7, 11, 13}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}\n\nNow, we need to verify if the symmetric difference is distributive over union. The distributive property states that:\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C)\n\nTo verify this, we need a third set C. Let C = {7, 9, 13, 15}. Now, let's find the symmetric difference and union for these sets.\n\nA ∆ B = {3, 7, 11, 13}\nA ∆ C = {3, 5, 15}\nB ∪ C = {5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B ∪ C):\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = {3, 5, 11, 15}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the symmetric differences (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C) = {3, 7, 11, 13} ∪ {3, 5, 15} = {3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15}\n\nSince A ∆ (B ∪ C) ≠ (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C), the symmetric difference is not distributive over union."
