    "message_2": "First, we need to check if the given system of linear equations has a singular matrix. To do this, we will find the determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficients of the variables.\n\nThe matrix A formed by the coefficients is:\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 2  4  6 |\n    | 3  6  9 |\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 1 * (4 * 9 - 6 * 6) - 2 * (2 * 9 - 6 * 3) + 3 * (2 * 6 - 4 * 3)\n\ndet(A) = 1 * (36 - 36) - 2 * (18 - 18) + 3 * (12 - 12)\n\ndet(A) = 1 * 0 - 2 * 0 + 3 * 0\n\ndet(A) = 0\n\nSince the determinant of the matrix A is 0, the matrix is singular.\n\nNow, let's check if the system of linear equations has a unique solution, infinite solutions, or no solution. To do this, we will find the rank of the matrix A and the augmented matrix [A|B], where B is the matrix formed by the constants on the right side of the equations.\n\nMatrix B:\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | 14  |\n    | 21  |\n\nThe augmented matrix [A|B] is:\n\n[A|B] = | 1  2  3 | 7 |\n        | 2  4  6 | 14 |\n        | 3  6  9 | 21 |\n\nNow, let's find the rank of A and [A|B]. We can use Gaussian elimination to do this.\n\nMatrix A:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n| 1  2  3 |\n| 0  0  0 |\n| 0  0  0 |\n\nRank(A) = 1 (since there is only one non-zero row)\n\nAugmented matrix [A|B]:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n| 1  2  3 |  7 |\n| 0  0  0 |  0 |\n| 0  0  0 |  0 |\n\nRank([A|B]) = 1 (since there is only one non-zero row)\n\nSince Rank(A) = Rank([A|B]), the system of linear equations has infinite solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express the variables y and z in terms of x:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 7\n\nLet x = x\n\nThen, y and z can be any real numbers. So, the general solution is:\n\nx = x\ny = y\nz = z\n\nwhere x, y, and z are any real numbers that satisfy the equation x + 2y + 3z = 7."
