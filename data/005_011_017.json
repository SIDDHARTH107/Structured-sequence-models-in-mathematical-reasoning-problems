    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces rubber balls, and they want to ensure that the balls have a uniform bounce. They decide to test the bounciness of the balls by dropping them from a height of 1 meter onto a flat surface and measuring the height they bounce back up to. They randomly select 25 balls from their production line to test. The data from the experiment is shown below:\n\nBall Number | Bounce Height (m)\n--- | ---\n1 | 0.95\n2 | 1.02\n3 | 0.98\n4 | 1.00\n5 | 0.96\n6 | 1.03\n7 | 0.97\n8 | 1.01\n9 | 1.00\n10 | 0.99\n11 | 1.01\n12 | 0.98\n13 | 0.95\n14 | 1.03\n15 | 0.97\n16 | 1.00\n17 | 0.99\n18 | 0.96\n19 | 1.02\n20 | 1.00\n21 | 0.98\n22 | 1.01\n23 | 0.97\n24 | 1.03\n25 | 0.98\n\nCalculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the bounce heights.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the bounce heights, we will first organize the data and then perform the necessary calculations.\n\nOrganize the data in ascending order:\n\n0.95, 0.95, 0.96, 0.96, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, 0.98, 0.98, 0.98, 0.99, 0.99, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.01, 1.01, 1.01, 1.02, 1.02, 1.03, 1.03, 1.03, 1.03\n\nMean:\nAdd all the bounce heights and divide by the total number of balls (25).\n\n(0.95 + 0.95 + 0.96 + 0.96 + 0.97 + 0.97 + 0.97 + 0.98 + 0.98 + 0.98 + 0.98 + 0.99 + 0.99 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 1.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 + 1.02 + 1.02 + 1.03 + 1.03 + 1.03 + 1.03) / 25\n\n= 24.75 / 25\n\nMean = 0.99\n\nMedian:\nSince the data is already organized in ascending order, the median is the middle value. In this case, there are 25 data points, so the median is the 13th value.\n\nMedian = 0.99\n\nStandard Deviation:\nTo calculate the standard deviation, we will first find the variance. The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\n1. Calculate the difference between each bounce height and the mean, then square the result.\n2. Find the average of those squared differences.\n3. Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n\nDifferences squared:\n(0.95-0.99)^2 = 0.0016\n(0.95-0.99)^2 = 0.0016\n(0.96-0.99)^2 = 0.0009\n(0.96-0.99)^2 = 0.0009\n(0.97-0.99)^2 = 0.0004\n(0.97-0.99)^2 = 0.0004\n(0.97-0.99)^2 = 0.0004\n(0.98-0.99)^2 = 0.0001\n(0.98-0.99)^2 = 0.0001\n(0.98-0.99)^2 = 0.0001\n(0.98-0.99)^2 = 0.0001\n(0.99-0.99)^2 = 0.0000\n(0.99-0.99)^2 = 0.0000\n(1.00-0.99)^2 = 0.0001\n(1.00-0.99)^2 = 0.0001\n(1.00-0.99)^2 = 0.0001\n(1.01-0.99)^2 = 0.0004\n(1.01-0.99)^2 = 0.0004\n(1.01-0.99)^2 = 0.0004\n(1.02-0.99)^2 = 0.0009\n(1.02-0.99)^2 = 0.0009\n(1.03-0.99)^2 = 0.0016\n(1.03-0.99)^2 = 0.0016\n(1.03-0.99)^2 = 0.0016\n(1.03-0.99)^2 = 0.0016\n\nSum of squared differences = 0.0144\n\nVariance = (0.0144) / 25 = 0.000576\n\nStandard Deviation = √0.000576 ≈ 0.024\n\nSo, the mean bounce height is 0.99 meters, the median is 0.99 meters, and the standard deviation is approximately 0.024 meters."
