    "message_1": "A company has 5 spots available for its executive team and 8 qualified candidates. In how many ways can the company choose its executive team from the 8 qualified candidates?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways the company can choose its executive team, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of candidates (8 in this case), k is the number of spots available (5 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!(8-5)!)\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!3!)\n\nC(8, 5) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\n\nC(8, 5) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1)\n\nC(8, 5) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 5) = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 different ways the company can choose its executive team from the 8 qualified candidates."
