    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the space between three mutually tangent circles with a new circle tangent to the original three. The Descartes Circle Theorem states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures (k1, k2, k3, k4), the following equation holds:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nCurvature is the reciprocal of the radius, so we can rewrite the equation in terms of radii:\n\n(1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3 + 1/r4)^2 = 2(1/r1^2 + 1/r2^2 + 1/r3^2 + 1/r4^2)\n\nGiven the starting circles with radii 1, 2, and 3, we can find the radius of the first inner circle:\n\n(1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/r4)^2 = 2(1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + 1/r4^2)\n\nSolving for r4:\n\n(1 + 1/2 + 1/3)^2 = 2(1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/r4^2)\n(11/6)^2 = 2(1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/r4^2)\n121/36 = 2(97/36 + 1/r4^2)\n24/36 = 1/r4^2\nr4^2 = 3/2\nr4 = sqrt(3/2)\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of all the circles in the gasket. The sum will be a geometric series, as each new circle added will have a smaller radius than the previous one. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:\n\nS = a / (1 - r)\n\nwhere S is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio. In this case, the first term is the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of the starting circles:\n\na = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 11/6\n\nThe common ratio can be found by dividing the reciprocal of the radius of the first inner circle by the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of the starting circles:\n\nr = (1/sqrt(3/2)) / (11/6) = 6/sqrt(3*11)\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of all the circles in the gasket:\n\nS = (11/6) / (1 - 6/sqrt(3*11))\nS = (11/6) / (sqrt(3*11) - 6)\nS â‰ˆ 1.8319\n\nThe sum of the reciprocals of the radii of all the circles in the Apollonian gasket with starting circles of radii 1, 2, and 3 is approximately 1.8319."
