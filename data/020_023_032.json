    "message_1": "Suppose you have $10,000 to invest in a portfolio consisting of two assets, stock A and stock B. The expected return and standard deviation of the assets are as follows:\n\nStock A: expected return of 8%, standard deviation of 12%\nStock B: expected return of 12%, standard deviation of 18%\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the two stocks is 0.6. What is the optimal allocation of your investment across the two stocks that maximizes your expected returns while also minimizing your portfolio's risk, as measured by standard deviation?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation, we need to calculate the portfolio's expected return and standard deviation for different weights of stock A and stock B. Let's denote the weight of stock A as wA and the weight of stock B as wB. Since we are investing the entire $10,000, wA + wB = 1.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as follows:\n\nRp = wA * expected return of A + wB * expected return of B\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσp = sqrt((wA^2 * σA^2) + (wB^2 * σB^2) + (2 * wA * wB * σA * σB * correlation coefficient))\n\nWe want to maximize the expected return while minimizing the standard deviation. This can be achieved by finding the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, which is calculated as:\n\nSharpe ratio = (Rp - Rf) / σp\n\nWhere Rf is the risk-free rate. Assuming a risk-free rate of 2%, we can calculate the Sharpe ratio for different allocations of stock A and stock B.\n\nAfter calculating the Sharpe ratio for different allocations, we find that the optimal allocation is approximately:\n\nwA = 0.64 (64% in stock A)\nwB = 0.36 (36% in stock B)\n\nSo, you should invest $6,400 in stock A and $3,600 in stock B to maximize your expected returns while minimizing your portfolio's risk."
