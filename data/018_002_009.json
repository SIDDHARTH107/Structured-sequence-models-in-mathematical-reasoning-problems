    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B, we need to show that every element in the intersection of A and B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nThe intersection of set A and set B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set containing all elements that are common to both A and B. In this case, A ∩ B = { 3, 4, 5 }.\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x from the intersection A ∩ B. We know that x must be one of the elements { 3, 4, 5 }.\n\nSince x is an element of A ∩ B, it must be an element of both A and B by definition of intersection. We can see that 3, 4, and 5 are indeed elements of both A and B:\n\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ B\n5 ∈ A and 5 ∈ B\n\nSince every element x in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A and a subset of B."
