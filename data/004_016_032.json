Use the Mean Value Theorem to prove that at some point during the 5-hour trip, the car was traveling precisely at the average speed of the entire journey. Determine the speed of the car at that point.",
    "message_2": "To use the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to find the average speed of the entire journey. We can do this by finding the total distance traveled and dividing it by the total time taken.\n\nFor the first 2 hours, the car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, so the distance covered in this time is:\nDistance1 = Speed1 × Time1 = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nFor the next 3 hours, the car travels at an average speed of 40 miles per hour, so the distance covered in this time is:\nDistance2 = Speed2 × Time2 = 40 mph × 3 hours = 120 miles\n\nThe total distance traveled is the sum of the distances covered in each segment:\nTotal Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles\n\nThe total time taken for the journey is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nNow we can find the average speed of the entire journey:\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 240 miles / 5 hours = 48 miles per hour\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, the function represents the car's speed, which is continuous and differentiable over the 5-hour interval. The average rate of change of the function (the average speed) is 48 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there must be at least one point during the 5-hour trip where the car's speed is exactly 48 miles per hour."
