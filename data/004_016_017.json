    "message_2": "To find the average velocity of the car over the interval [0, 10], we can use the Mean Value Theorem. The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a number c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, the function represents the position of the car, and we want to find the average velocity over the interval [0, 10]. The average velocity is the total distance traveled divided by the time taken. \n\nAverage velocity = (Final position - Initial position) / (Final time - Initial time)\n\nSince the car starts at rest and travels 300 meters in the first 10 seconds, the initial position is 0 meters, and the final position is 300 meters. The initial time is 0 seconds, and the final time is 10 seconds.\n\nAverage velocity = (300 - 0) / (10 - 0)\nAverage velocity = 300 / 10\nAverage velocity = 30 m/s\n\nSo, the average velocity of the car over the interval [0, 10] is 30 meters per second."
