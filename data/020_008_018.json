The transportation costs from each factory to each store, and the available supply in each factory are as follows:\n\n|      | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 | Store 6 | Store 7 | Store 8 | Supply |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Factory 1 | 12    | 14    | 20    | 18    |  8     | 12    |  6     |   6    |   100  |\n| Factory 2 | 10    |  8     |  9      | 12    | 19    | 15    |  14    |  20   |    80   |\n| Factory 3 |  9     | 15    |  5      |  8     |  6     | 12    |  14    |  10   |   120  |\n| Factory 4 |  8     | 10     | 15    | 11     | 10    |  8     |  3      |  7     |    90   |\n| Factory 5 |  12    |  9     | 14    | 16     |  5     | 11     |  7     |  9     |    70   |\n\nHow many units of product should each factory supply to each retail store to minimize the total transportation cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total transportation cost, we can use the transportation algorithm, specifically the Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM). Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the penalty cost for each row and column by subtracting the smallest cost from the second smallest cost.\n2. Select the row or column with the highest penalty cost.\n3. Allocate as many units as possible to the cell with the lowest cost in the selected row or column.\n4. Cross out the row or column that has its supply or demand fulfilled.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all supplies and demands are fulfilled.\n\nFollowing these steps, we get the following allocations:\n\n|      | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 | Store 6 | Store 7 | Store 8 | Supply |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Factory 1 | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    |  80     | 0    |  20     |   0    |   100  |\n| Factory 2 | 0    |  0     |  0      | 0    | 0    | 80    |  0    |  0   |    80   |\n| Factory 3 |  0     | 0    |  80      |  0     |  0     | 0    |  0    |  40   |   120  |\n| Factory 4 |  80     | 0     | 0    | 0     | 0    |  0     |  10      |  0     |    90   |\n| Factory 5 |  0    |  80     | 0    | 80     |  0     | 0     |  0     |  0     |    70   |\n\nSo, the optimal allocation to minimize the total transportation cost is:\n\n- Factory 1: 80 units to Store 5, 20 units to Store 7\n- Factory 2: 80 units to Store 6\n- Factory 3: 80 units to Store 3, 40 units to Store 8\n- Factory 4: 80 units to Store 1, 10 units to Store 7\n- Factory 5: 80 units to Store 2, 80 units to Store 4"
