    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 8 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of flips (8 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (4 heads)\n- p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (1-p, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X=4) = (8C4) * (0.5^4) * (0.5^4)\n\nFirst, we calculate 8C4:\n\n8C4 = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n     = 8! / (4!4!)\n     = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1)\n     = 70\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X=4) = 70 * (0.5^4) * (0.5^4)\n       = 70 * 0.0625 * 0.0625\n       = 70 * 0.00390625\n       = 0.2734375\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 8 coin flips is approximately 0.2734 or 27.34%."
