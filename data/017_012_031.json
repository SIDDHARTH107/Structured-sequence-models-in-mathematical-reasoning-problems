    "message_2": "There are 14 non-isomorphic groups of order 16.\n\nTo see this, we can use the fact that a group of order 16 must be a p-group, where p is a prime number. In this case, p = 2, so we are looking for 2-groups of order 16. The structure of a group of order 16 can be described by its composition factors, which are the factors in the composition series of the group.\n\nSince 16 = 2^4, the possible composition factors for a group of order 16 are:\n\n1. 2, 2, 2, 2\n2. 4, 2, 2\n3. 4, 4\n4. 8, 2\n5. 16\n\nNow, we can list the non-isomorphic groups corresponding to each of these composition factors:\n\n1. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 (the direct product of four cyclic groups of order 2)\n2. (a) C_4 × C_2 × C_2\n   (b) D_8 (the dihedral group of order 8) × C_2\n   (c) Q_8 (the quaternion group of order 8) × C_2\n3. (a) C_4 × C_4\n   (b) C_16 (the cyclic group of order 16)\n4. (a) C_8 × C_2\n   (b) D_16 (the dihedral group of order 16)\n   (c) Q_16 (the generalized quaternion group of order 16)\n   (d) The semidirect product of C_8 and C_2, where C_2 acts non-trivially on C_8\n5. (a) The direct product of the cyclic group of order 4 and the quaternion group of order 8, denoted as C_4 × Q_8\n   (b) The semidirect product of C_4 and Q_8, where C_4 acts non-trivially on Q_8\n\nIn total, there are 14 non-isomorphic groups of order 16."
