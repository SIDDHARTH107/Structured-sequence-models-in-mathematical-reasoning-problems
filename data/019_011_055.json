    "message_2": "In relevance logic, we need to evaluate the statement \"(p ∧ q) → p\" given the truth values p = 1 (true) and q = 0 (false).\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the conjunction (p ∧ q):\nSince p is true and q is false, the conjunction (p ∧ q) is false (0).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the implication (→) with the values we found:\nThe statement becomes \"(0) → (1)\", which means \"if (p ∧ q) is false, then p is true.\"\n\nIn relevance logic, an implication is considered true if the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the part after the arrow). This is because relevance logic aims to avoid irrelevant implications, where the truth of the antecedent has no bearing on the truth of the consequent.\n\nSo, in this case, since the antecedent (p ∧ q) is false, the implication \"(p ∧ q) → p\" is considered true (1)."
