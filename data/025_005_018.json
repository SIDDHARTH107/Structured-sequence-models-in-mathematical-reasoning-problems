    "message_2": "To determine the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^3 - 3xy^2 + y^3 = 0$, we first need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy + 3y^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$\n\n$-6xy + 3y^2 = 0$\n\nSolving the first equation for $x^2$:\n\n$x^2 = y^2$\n\nNow, we have two cases: $x = y$ and $x = -y$. Let's analyze each case separately.\n\nCase 1: $x = y$\n\nSubstituting $x$ for $y$ in the second equation:\n\n$-6x^2 + 3x^2 = 0$\n\n$-3x^2 = 0$\n\n$x = 0$\n\nSo, in this case, we have the point $(0, 0)$.\n\nCase 2: $x = -y$\n\nSubstituting $-y$ for $x$ in the second equation:\n\n$6y^2 + 3y^2 = 0$\n\n$9y^2 = 0$\n\n$y = 0$\n\nSo, in this case, we have the point $(0, 0)$ as well.\n\nNow, we need to classify the singularity at the point $(0, 0)$. To do this, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -6y$\n\nNow, we evaluate these second partial derivatives at the point $(0, 0)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(0, 0) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}(0, 0) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(0, 0) = 0$\n\nSince all second partial derivatives are equal to zero, we need to analyze the Hessian matrix:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix} 6x & -6y \\\\ -6y & 6y \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAt the point $(0, 0)$, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$H(f)(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is singular, so we cannot use it to classify the singularity. However, we can analyze the equation $x^3 - 3xy^2 + y^3 = 0$ directly. By factoring, we get:\n\n$(x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) = 0$\n\nThis equation represents the union of a line $x - y = 0$ and a conic $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0$. Since the line and the conic intersect at a single point $(0, 0)$, the singularity at $(0, 0)$ is a double point."
