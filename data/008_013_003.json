    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nMatrix A:\n[ 2  3 -1]\n[ 4 -2  1]\n[-2  5 -3]\n\nWe perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the U matrix:\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 (the first element of the first row):\nL1:\n[ 1  0  0]\n[ 2  1  0]\n[ 0  0  1]\n\nU1:\n[ 2  3 -1]\n[ 0 -8  3]\n[-2  5 -3]\n\nStep 2: Add the first row multiplied by -1 to the third row:\nL2:\n[ 1  0  0]\n[ 2  1  0]\n[-1  0  1]\n\nU2:\n[ 2  3 -1]\n[ 0 -8  3]\n[ 0  8 -2]\n\nStep 3: Add the second row to the third row:\nL3:\n[ 1  0  0]\n[ 2  1  0]\n[-1  1  1]\n\nU3:\n[ 2  3 -1]\n[ 0 -8  3]\n[ 0  0  1]\n\nNow we have L and U matrices:\nL = [ 1  0  0]\n      [ 2  1  0]\n      [-1  1  1]\n\nU = [ 2  3 -1]\n      [ 0 -8  3]\n      [ 0  0  1]\n\nNext, we solve the equation Ly = b for y:\n\n[ 1  0  0] [y1]   [ 1]\n[ 2  1  0] [y2] = [-7]\n[-1  1  1] [y3]   [10]\n\nSolving for y:\ny1 = 1\ny2 = -7 - 2y1 = -9\ny3 = 10 + 1 - (-9) = 20\n\ny = [1, -9, 20]\n\nFinally, we solve the equation Ux = y for x:\n\n[ 2  3 -1] [x1]   [ 1]\n[ 0 -8  3] [x2] = [-9]\n[ 0  0  1] [x3]   [20]\n\nSolving for x:\nx3 = 20\nx2 = (-9 - 3x3) / -8 = 1.75\nx1 = (1 - 3x2 + x3) / 2 = 0.25\n\nx = [0.25, 1.75, 20]\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0.25, y = 1.75, and z = 20, rounded off to two decimal places."
