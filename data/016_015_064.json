    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve, which means it fills a square completely without crossing itself. The length of the Hilbert curve increases with each order, and it can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nLength = (Side length of the square) × (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, the side length of the square is 1 (assuming a unit square), and n = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = (1) × (4^3 - 1) / 3\nLength = (1) × (64 - 1) / 3\nLength = (1) × (63) / 3\nLength = 63 / 3\nLength = 21\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert curve of order 3 is 21 units."
