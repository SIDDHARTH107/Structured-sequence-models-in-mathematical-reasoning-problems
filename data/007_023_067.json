    "message_1": "A cryptographic hash function H(x) takes any input x and produces a fixed length output of 256 bits. The function is such that it difficult to find two distinct inputs x and y such that H(x) = H(y). \n\nSuppose the input x is a 1024-bit integer and H(x) is a 256-bit integer. If a hacker can try 1 billion possible inputs per second, how many years on average will it take for the hacker to find another input y such that H(x) = H(y)? Assume that there are 2^(256) possible hash outputs.",
    "message_2": "To find another input y such that H(x) = H(y), the hacker needs to perform a birthday attack. In this case, the birthday paradox applies, which states that the probability of finding a collision (two inputs with the same hash output) is approximately 50% after trying about √(2 * N) random inputs, where N is the number of possible hash outputs.\n\nSince there are 2^256 possible hash outputs, the number of attempts needed to find a collision with a 50% probability is:\n\n√(2 * 2^256) = 2^128\n\nThe hacker can try 1 billion (10^9) inputs per second. Therefore, the time required to perform 2^128 attempts is:\n\n(2^128) / (10^9) seconds\n\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365.25 days in a year (accounting for leap years). So, the time in years is:\n\n(2^128) / (10^9 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25) years\n\nCalculating this value:\n\n(2^128) / (10^9 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25) ≈ 1.07 * 10^25 years\n\nOn average, it will take the hacker about 1.07 * 10^25 years to find another input y such that H(x) = H(y)."
