    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, Player 1 proposes a division of $100 and offers a certain amount to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts, both players get their respective shares; if Player 2 rejects, both players receive nothing. What is the highest amount that Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to ensure that Player 2 will accept? Assume that Player 2 accepts any offer greater than or equal to 30% of the total amount ($30 or more).",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, Player 1 should offer the minimum amount that Player 2 is willing to accept to maximize their own share. Since Player 2 accepts any offer greater than or equal to 30% of the total amount ($30 or more), Player 1 should offer $30 to Player 2. This ensures that Player 2 will accept the offer, and Player 1 will receive the remaining $70."
