    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 3x + 5y = 67 for positive integer solutions of x and y, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients (3 and 5) divides the constant term (67). In this case, the GCD of 3 and 5 is 1, and 1 does divide 67, so there should be integer solutions for x and y.\n\n2. Find a particular solution for the equation. We can do this by using the extended Euclidean algorithm or by trial and error. In this case, we can try different values for x and y:\n\n   If x = 1, then 3(1) + 5y = 67, so 5y = 64, which means y = 64/5, which is not an integer.\n   If x = 2, then 3(2) + 5y = 67, so 5y = 61, which means y = 61/5, which is not an integer.\n   If x = 3, then 3(3) + 5y = 67, so 5y = 58, which means y = 58/5, which is not an integer.\n   If x = 4, then 3(4) + 5y = 67, so 5y = 55, which means y = 11 (an integer).\n\nSo, a particular solution is x = 4 and y = 11.\n\n3. Use the general solution formula for Diophantine equations of the form ax + by = c, which is:\n\n   x = x0 + (b/d)n\n   y = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions found in step 2, a and b are the coefficients (3 and 5), d is the GCD of a and b (1), and n is an integer.\n\nIn this case, the general solution is:\n\n   x = 4 + 5n\n   y = 11 - 3n\n\n4. Find the positive integer solutions for x and y:\n\n   For n = 0, x = 4 and y = 11 (already found in step 2).\n   For n = 1, x = 4 + 5(1) = 9 and y = 11 - 3(1) = 8.\n   For n = 2, x = 4 + 5(2) = 14 and y = 11 - 3(2) = 5.\n   For n = 3, x = 4 + 5(3) = 19 and y = 11 - 3(3) = 2.\n\nWhen n = 4, x = 4 + 5(4) = 24 and y = 11 - 3(4) = -1, which is not a positive integer. Since y will continue to decrease as n increases, there are no more positive integer solutions.\n\nSo, the positive integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 3x + 5y = 67 are:\n\n   (x, y) = (4, 11), (9, 8), (14, 5), and (19, 2)."
