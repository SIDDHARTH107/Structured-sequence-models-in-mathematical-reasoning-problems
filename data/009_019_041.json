Suppose $X_0 = 100$ and we want to find the probability that $X_t$ will be greater than or equal to $120$ at time $t=1$. \n\nDetermine the probability that $X_t \\geq 120$ at time $t=1$ using the stochastic differential equation and show your work.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that $X_t \\geq 120$ at time $t=1$, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The SDE is a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model, which has the following closed-form solution:\n\n$$X_t = X_0 e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t}$$\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for $X_0$, $\\mu$, and $\\sigma$:\n\n$$X_t = 100 e^{(0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2)t + 0.2 W_t}$$\n\nWe want to find the probability that $X_t \\geq 120$ at time $t=1$. To do this, we can first find the distribution of $X_t$ at $t=1$. The logarithm of a GBM is normally distributed, so we have:\n\n$$\\ln(X_t) = \\ln(100) + (0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2)(1) + 0.2 W_1$$\n\nSince $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, $W_1$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $1$. Therefore, the distribution of $\\ln(X_t)$ is also normal with mean:\n\n$$\\mu_{\\ln(X_t)} = \\ln(100) + (0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2)(1) = 4.60517$$\n\nand variance:\n\n$$\\sigma^2_{\\ln(X_t)} = (0.2)^2(1) = 0.04$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t \\geq 120$ at time $t=1$. We can rewrite this inequality in terms of the logarithm:\n\n$$\\ln(X_t) \\geq \\ln(120)$$\n\nNext, we can standardize the normal distribution by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\ln(X_t) - \\mu_{\\ln(X_t)}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2_{\\ln(X_t)}}} \\geq \\frac{\\ln(120) - 4.60517}{\\sqrt{0.04}}$$\n\n$$Z \\geq 1.87123$$\n\nwhere $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. Now, we can find the probability using the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF):\n\n$$P(X_t \\geq 120) = P(Z \\geq 1.87123) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1.87123) = 1 - \\Phi(1.87123)$$\n\nUsing a standard normal table or a calculator, we find that:\n\n$$\\Phi(1.87123) \\approx 0.9693$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that $X_t \\geq 120$ at time $t=1$ is:\n\n$$P(X_t \\geq 120) \\approx 1 - 0.9693 = 0.0307$$\n\nSo, there is approximately a 3.07% chance that $X_t$ will be greater than or equal to $120$ at time $t=1$."
