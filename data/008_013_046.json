    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as AX = B, where\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2 -5  3 |\n    | 4 -3  1 |\n\nB = |  5 |\n    | -1 |\n    | 13 |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\nWe will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the U matrix and keep track of the elimination factors to obtain the L matrix.\n\n1. No need to swap rows, so we can proceed with elimination.\n2. Eliminate the 2 in the (2,1) position:\n   Multiply row 1 by 2 and subtract it from row 2.\n   L21 = 2 (this is the first entry in the L matrix)\n\nNew A matrix:\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 0 -9  5 |\n    | 4 -3  1 |\n\n3. Eliminate the 4 in the (3,1) position:\n   Multiply row 1 by 4 and subtract it from row 3.\n   L31 = 4 (this is the second entry in the L matrix)\n\nNew A matrix:\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 0 -9  5 |\n    | 0 -11  5 |\n\n4. No need to swap rows, so we can proceed with elimination.\n5. Eliminate the -11 in the (3,2) position:\n   Multiply row 2 by -11/9 and subtract it from row 3.\n   L32 = -11/9 (this is the third entry in the L matrix)\n\nNew A matrix:\nA = |  1   2  -1 |\n    |  0  -9   5 |\n    |  0   0  -10/9 |\n\nNow, we have the L and U matrices:\n\nL = |  1   0   0 |\n    |  2   1   0 |\n    |  4 -11/9  1 |\n\nU = |  1   2  -1 |\n    |  0  -9   5 |\n    |  0   0 -10/9 |\n\nStep 2: Solve LY = B for Y\nWe have L = |  1   0   0 |, Y = | y1 |, and B = |  5 |\n               |  2   1   0 |      | y2 |          | -1 |\n               |  4 -11/9  1 |      | y3 |          | 13 |\n\n1. y1 = 5\n2. 2y1 + y2 = -1 => y2 = -1 - 2(5) = -11\n3. 4y1 - (11/9)y2 + y3 = 13 => y3 = 13 - 4(5) + (11/9)(11) = -10/9\n\nSo, Y = |  5  |\n          | -11 |\n          |-10/9|\n\nStep 3: Solve UX = Y for X\nWe have U = |  1   2  -1 |, X = | x |, and Y = |  5  |\n               |  0  -9   5 |      | y |          | -11 |\n               |  0   0 -10/9 |      | z |          |-10/9|\n\n1. (-10/9)z = -10/9 => z = 1\n2. -9y + 5z = -11 => y = (-11 - 5(1)) / -9 = 16/9\n3. x + 2y - z = 5 => x = 5 - 2(16/9) + 1 = 23/9\n\nSo, the solution is x = 23/9, y = 16/9, and z = 1."
