    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(24), we need to find the prime factors of 24 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n24 can be factored as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3. We have a pair of 2's, so we can take one 2 out of the square root.\n\n√(24) = √(2 × 2 × 2 × 3) = 2√(2 × 3) = 2√(6)\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 2√(6)."
