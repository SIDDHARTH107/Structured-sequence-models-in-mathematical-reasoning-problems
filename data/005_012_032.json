    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to estimate the average age of the employees in their organization. They have a list of 500 employees, but they can only survey 50 employees due to budget constraints. Using systematic sampling, they randomly selected the first employee from the first 10 and then selected every 10th employee on the list. \n\nWhat is the probability that the selected sample will include an employee who is over the age of 50, given that previous surveys have shown that 30% of the employees in the organization are over the age of 50?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the probability that an employee is not over the age of 50. Since 30% of the employees are over the age of 50, the remaining 70% are not over the age of 50. \n\nNow, we need to find the probability that none of the 50 selected employees are over the age of 50. Since the employees are selected independently, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\nP(None of the 50 selected employees are over the age of 50) = (0.7)^50 ≈ 0.000000002\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that at least one of the selected employees is over the age of 50. To do this, we can find the complement of the probability that none of the selected employees are over the age of 50:\n\nP(At least one employee over the age of 50) = 1 - P(None of the 50 selected employees are over the age of 50) = 1 - 0.000000002 ≈ 0.999999998\n\nSo, the probability that the selected sample will include an employee who is over the age of 50 is approximately 0.999999998 or 99.9999998%."
