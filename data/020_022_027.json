    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $8000 to spend on advertising their new product on social media platforms. The cost per click for Facebook is $0.60 and for Instagram is $0.80. The company wants to know how many clicks they should allocate for each platform in order to maximize their reach within their budget. What is the optimal allocation of clicks per platform for the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of clicks on Facebook and y be the number of clicks on Instagram. The cost function can be represented as:\n\n0.60x + 0.80y ≤ 8000\n\nWe want to maximize the number of clicks, so we can set up the following objective function:\n\nMaximize: x + y\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal allocation of clicks per platform. We can rewrite the cost function as:\n\ny ≤ (8000 - 0.60x) / 0.80\n\nWe can now find the maximum integer values of x and y that satisfy the inequality:\n\nFor x = 0:\ny ≤ (8000 - 0.60(0)) / 0.80\ny ≤ 10000\n\nFor y = 0:\nx ≤ (8000 - 0.80(0)) / 0.60\nx ≤ 13333.33\n\nSince we need integer values for x and y, we can round down the values to:\n\nx = 13333\ny = 10000\n\nNow, we need to check if this allocation is within the budget:\n\n0.60(13333) + 0.80(10000) = 7999.8 + 8000 = 15999.8\n\nThis allocation is not within the budget. We need to find the largest integer values of x and y that satisfy the cost function:\n\n0.60x + 0.80y ≤ 8000\n\nWe can start by reducing the number of clicks on the more expensive platform (Instagram) and checking if the cost function is satisfied:\n\nFor y = 9999:\nx ≤ (8000 - 0.80(9999)) / 0.60\nx ≤ 1333.5\n\nx = 1333\n\nNow, let's check if this allocation is within the budget:\n\n0.60(1333) + 0.80(9999) = 799.8 + 7999.2 = 7999\n\nThis allocation is within the budget. Therefore, the optimal allocation of clicks per platform for the company is:\n\nFacebook: 1333 clicks\nInstagram: 9999 clicks"
