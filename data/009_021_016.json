    "message_1": "Consider the partial differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the intensity of light at position $x$ and time $t$ in a one-dimensional image. $D$ is the diffusion coefficient that is related to the blurring effect in the image.\n\nSuppose we have an image with a one-pixel-wide sharp edge located at $x=0$. At time $t=0$, the intensity of the edge is $1$ at $x=0$ and $0$ elsewhere. If $D=0.1$, what is the intensity of the edge at $x=0$ after $t=1$ second has passed?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the given partial differential equation with the given initial conditions. The equation is a heat equation, and its solution can be found using the method of separation of variables or by using the fundamental solution (Green's function). In this case, we will use the fundamental solution.\n\nThe fundamental solution to the heat equation is given by the Gaussian function:\n\n$G(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi Dt}}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}}$\n\nNow, we need to find the solution $u(x,t)$ that satisfies the initial condition. We can do this by convolving the initial condition with the fundamental solution:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G(x-x',t)f(x')dx'$\n\nwhere $f(x')$ is the initial condition, which is given by:\n\n$f(x') = \\begin{cases} \n      1 & x' = 0 \\\\\n      0 & x' \\neq 0 \n   \\end{cases}$\n\nSince $f(x')$ is non-zero only at $x'=0$, the convolution simplifies to:\n\n$u(x,t) = G(x,t)$\n\nNow, we can find the intensity of the edge at $x=0$ after $t=1$ second by plugging in the values:\n\n$u(0,1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi (0.1)(1)}}e^{-\\frac{0^2}{4(0.1)(1)}}$\n\n$u(0,1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi (0.1)}}$\n\n$u(0,1) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.256}}$\n\n$u(0,1) \\approx 0.891$\n\nSo, the intensity of the edge at $x=0$ after $t=1$ second has passed is approximately $0.891$."
