    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length, each measuring 8 cm. The angle formed by these two sides is 110 degrees. What is the length of the remaining side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the remaining side of the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, the isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length (a = b = 8 cm) and an angle C = 110 degrees. We can plug these values into the Law of Cosines formula to find the length of the remaining side (c):\n\nc² = 8² + 8² - 2(8)(8) * cos(110°)\n\nFirst, convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n110° * (π/180) ≈ 1.919 radians\n\nNow, plug the angle in radians into the formula:\n\nc² = 64 + 64 - 128 * cos(1.919)\nc² ≈ 64 + 64 - 128 * (-0.342)\nc² ≈ 128 + 43.776\nc² ≈ 171.776\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc ≈ √171.776\nc ≈ 13.1 cm\n\nSo, the length of the remaining side of the triangle is approximately 13.1 cm."
