    "message_1": "What is the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 3cos(2x+π/4)?\n\nSolution: \n\nThe general form of the cosine function is f(x) = Acos(Bx+C), where A is the amplitude, B is the inverse of the period, and C is the horizontal shift. \n\nComparing the given function f(x) with the general form, we can see that A = 3, B = 2, and C = π/4.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the function is 3, and the period of the function is 2π/B = 2π/2 = π.",
