    "message_1": "A company wants to determine the optimal price for selling a new product. The total cost of producing each unit is $50, and the company predicts that demand for the product will follow the equation Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price per unit. What is the optimal price the company should set to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the price that maximizes the profit function. The profit function is given by:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue can be calculated as the product of the price per unit (P) and the quantity demanded (Q), which is given by the equation Q = 100 - 2P. The cost can be calculated as the product of the total cost per unit ($50) and the quantity demanded (Q).\n\nSo, the profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit(P) = P * (100 - 2P) - 50 * (100 - 2P)\n\nNow, we need to find the price (P) that maximizes this profit function. To do this, we can take the derivative of the profit function with respect to P and set it equal to 0, then solve for P.\n\nd(Profit)/dP = d(P * (100 - 2P) - 50 * (100 - 2P))/dP\n\nUsing the product rule and the chain rule, we get:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = (100 - 2P) - 2P * 1 - 50 * (-2) = 100 - 4P + 100\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for P:\n\n0 = 100 - 4P + 100\n-200 = -4P\nP = 50\n\nSo, the optimal price the company should set to maximize their profit is $50 per unit."
