    "message_2": "Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous and the interval is symmetric, we can use the Fourier sine series to represent the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π]. The Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere b_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x) dx] from 0 to L, and L = π in this case.\n\nFirst, we need to find the coefficients b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[x^2 * sin(n * x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = -cos(n * x) / n\n\nNow, apply integration by parts:\n\n∫[x^2 * sin(n * x) dx] = -x^2 * cos(n * x) / n + ∫[2x * cos(n * x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nFor the remaining integral, use integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = 2x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = sin(n * x) / n\n\nNow, apply integration by parts:\n\n∫[2x * cos(n * x) dx] = 2x * sin(n * x) / n - ∫[2 * sin(n * x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nThe remaining integral is:\n\n∫[2 * sin(n * x) dx] = -2 * cos(n * x) / n from 0 to π\n\nNow, substitute these results back into the expression for b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-x^2 * cos(n * x) / n + 2x * sin(n * x) / n - 2 * cos(n * x) / n] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluate the integral:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-π^2 * cos(n * π) / n) - 2 * cos(n * π) / n]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1)^n * (π^2 - 2) / n]\n\nNow, we have the Fourier sine series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = x^2 = ∑[(2/π) * ((-1)^n * (π^2 - 2) / n) * sin(n * x)]\n\nNow, we can find the solution u(x) to the boundary value problem:\n\nu''(x) + u(x) = f(x)\n\nSince f(x) is given by the Fourier sine series, we can find u(x) by integrating the Fourier sine series term-by-term:\n\nu(x) = ∑[A_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere A_n = (2/π) * ((-1)^n * (π^2 - 2) / (n^3))\n\nNow, we have the solution to the boundary value problem:\n\nu(x) = ∑[(2/π) * ((-1)^n * (π^2 - 2) / (n^3)) * sin(n * x)]"
