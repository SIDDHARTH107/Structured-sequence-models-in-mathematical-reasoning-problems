    "message_2": "To find the slope of the line passing through points $P$ and $Q$, we can use the formula for the slope between two points: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Plugging in the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$, we get:\n\n$m = \\frac{11 - 3}{5 - 1} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$\n\nSo, the slope of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is $2$."
