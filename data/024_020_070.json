    "message_2": "The Hopf map is a map from the 3-sphere S^3 to the 2-sphere S^2, defined as:\n\nh: S^3 → S^2, where h(x, y) = (2x * y^*, x^2 + y^2 - 1)\n\nHere, x and y are complex numbers, and * denotes the complex conjugate.\n\nNow, let's consider the 3-dimensional manifold M generated by gluing together two solid tori along their boundaries. The boundary of each solid torus is a 2-dimensional torus T^2. When we glue the two solid tori together, we can think of the resulting manifold M as a quotient space of S^3.\n\nTo determine the Hopf map of M, we need to find a map that is well-defined on the quotient space M and maps to S^2. We can define a map g: M → S^2 as follows:\n\ng([x, y]) = h(x, y)\n\nHere, [x, y] denotes the equivalence class of (x, y) in the quotient space M.\n\nTo show that g is well-defined, we need to show that if (x, y) and (x', y') are equivalent in M, then g([x, y]) = g([x', y']). Since M is formed by gluing two solid tori along their boundaries, we can assume that (x, y) and (x', y') are related by a homeomorphism between the boundaries of the two solid tori.\n\nLet f: T^2 → T^2 be such a homeomorphism. Then, we have:\n\n(x', y') = f(x, y)\n\nSince f is a homeomorphism, it preserves the structure of the tori, and we can find a continuous function F: S^3 → S^3 such that F(x, y) = (x', y') and F is the identity on the complement of the tori in S^3.\n\nNow, we can show that g is well-defined:\n\ng([x, y]) = h(x, y) = h(F(x, y)) = h(x', y') = g([x', y'])\n\nThus, g is a well-defined map from M to S^2, and it can be considered as the Hopf map of the manifold M."
