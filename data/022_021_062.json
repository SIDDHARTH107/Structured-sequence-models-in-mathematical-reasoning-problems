    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of f(t) = 5te^(-3t), we can use the formula for the Laplace transform of a function:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(0 to ∞) e^(-st)f(t) dt\n\nIn this case, f(t) = 5te^(-3t). So, we need to find the Laplace transform of this function:\n\nF(s) = ∫(0 to ∞) e^(-st) * 5te^(-3t) dt\n\nTo simplify the integral, we can combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(s) = 5 ∫(0 to ∞) te^(-t(s+3)) dt\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve the integral. Let u = t and dv = e^(-t(s+3)) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -1/(s+3)e^(-t(s+3)).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nF(s) = 5[-t/(s+3)e^(-t(s+3))|_(0 to ∞) - ∫(0 to ∞) -1/(s+3)e^(-t(s+3)) dt]\n\nEvaluate the first term:\n\nlim (t->∞) [-t/(s+3)e^(-t(s+3))] - [0] = 0\n\nNow, we have:\n\nF(s) = 5 ∫(0 to ∞) 1/(s+3)e^(-t(s+3)) dt\n\nThis is a standard Laplace transform of an exponential function:\n\nF(s) = 5/(s+3)^2\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = 5te^(-3t) is F(s) = 5/(s+3)^2."
