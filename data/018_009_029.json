    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × {5}:\n(A × B) × {5} = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nNext, let's find B × {5}:\nB × {5} = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find A × (B × {5}):\nA × (B × {5}) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nComparing the two results, we have:\n(A × B) × {5} = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\nA × (B × {5}) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nAs we can see, the two results are not the same. The elements of the sets are different in structure. In (A × B) × {5}, the elements are ordered pairs where the first element is an ordered pair from A × B, and the second element is from {5}. In A × (B × {5}), the elements are ordered pairs where the first element is from A, and the second element is an ordered pair from B × {5}.\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative."
