    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle with a radius of 5 cm. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. So, the area of the base is:\n\nA_base = π(5 cm)^2 = 25π cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. To do this, we first need to find the slant height of the cone. The slant height, radius, and height form a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height (s):\n\ns^2 = r^2 + h^2\ns^2 = (5 cm)^2 + (12 cm)^2\ns^2 = 25 cm^2 + 144 cm^2\ns^2 = 169 cm^2\ns = √169 cm^2 = 13 cm\n\nNow that we have the slant height, we can find the lateral surface area using the formula A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height:\n\nA_lateral = π(5 cm)(13 cm) = 65π cm^2\n\nFinally, we add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cone:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π cm^2 + 65π cm^2\nA_total = 90π cm^2\n\nNow, we can round our answer to the nearest hundredth:\n\nA_total ≈ 90 × 3.14 cm^2 ≈ 282.6 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 282.6 cm^2."
