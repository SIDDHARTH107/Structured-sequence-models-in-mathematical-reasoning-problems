If R(x, y) is true, then R(y, x) must also be true.\n2. If R(x, y) is not true, then R(y, x) must also not be true.\n\nLet's examine the elements of R and their corresponding pairs:\n\n(1, 1) → (1, 1) ✓\n(2, 2) → (2, 2) ✓\n(3, 3) → (3, 3) ✓\n(4, 4) → (4, 4) ✓\n(1, 2) → (2, 1) ✓\n(2, 1) → (1, 2) ✓\n(3, 4) → (4, 3) ✓\n(4, 3) → (3, 4) ✓\n\nAll pairs in R satisfy the first condition. Now let's check the second condition:\n\n(1, 3) → (3, 1) ✗\n(1, 4) → (4, 1) ✗\n(2, 3) → (3, 2) ✗\n(2, 4) → (4, 2) ✗\n\nThe second condition does not hold for all pairs of elements in A. Therefore, the formula ∀x∀y((R(x,y) → R(y,x)) ∧ (¬R(x,y) → ¬R(y,x))) is not true in the given structure."
