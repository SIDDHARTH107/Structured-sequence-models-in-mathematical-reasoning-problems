    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation dy/dx = 2x, we need to integrate both sides with respect to x.\n\n∫(dy/dx) dx = ∫2x dx\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\ny(x) = x^2 + C\n\nNow, we are given the initial condition y(0) = 4. We can use this to find the constant C.\n\ny(0) = (0)^2 + C = 4\nC = 4\n\nSo, the particular solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = x^2 + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 3.\n\ny(3) = (3)^2 + 4\ny(3) = 9 + 4\ny(3) = 13\n\nTherefore, the value of y when x = 3 is 13."
