    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to recall the definition of the Fourier transform and its properties. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and i is the imaginary unit. The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) ∫[F(ω) * e^(iωt)] dω\n\nNow, let's apply the Fourier transform to the given differential equation:\n\ny'' + 4y = -16sin(2t)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:\n\n(ω^2)Y(ω) - 4Y(ω) = -16 * (1/2i) [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t) and δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function. Now, we can simplify the equation:\n\nY(ω) * (ω^2 - 4) = -8i [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = (-8i / (ω^2 - 4)) [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNow, we can apply the inverse Fourier transform to find y(t):\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) ∫[(-8i / (ω^2 - 4)) [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)] * e^(iωt)] dω\n\nThe integral can be separated into two parts:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) [-8i ∫(1 / (ω^2 - 4)) δ(ω - 2) * e^(iωt) dω + 8i ∫(1 / (ω^2 - 4)) δ(ω + 2) * e^(iωt) dω]\n\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, we can simplify the integrals:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) [-8i * (1 / (2^2 - 4)) * e^(i2t) + 8i * (1 / (-2^2 - 4)) * e^(-i2t)]\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) [-8i * (1 / 0) * e^(i2t) + 8i * (1 / (-8)) * e^(-i2t)]\n\nThe first term is undefined, so we can ignore it. The second term simplifies to:\n\ny(t) = (1 / π) * e^(-i2t)\n\nNow, we need to find the real part of y(t) since the original differential equation is real-valued:\n\ny(t) = (1 / π) * cos(2t)\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation using the Fourier transform."
