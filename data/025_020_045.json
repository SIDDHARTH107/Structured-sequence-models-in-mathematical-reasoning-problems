    "message_2": "The given equation defines a quartic hypersurface in projective space $\\mathbb{P}^3$. To compute the Euler characteristic of this Calabi-Yau surface, we can use the following formula for the Euler characteristic of a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$:\n\n$$\\chi = d(d-3)(d-1)$$\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the defining polynomial, which in this case is $4$.\n\nPlugging in the value of $d$, we get:\n\n$$\\chi = 4(4-3)(4-1) = 4(1)(3) = 12$$\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the smooth Calabi-Yau surface given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0$ in projective space $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is $\\boxed{12}$."
