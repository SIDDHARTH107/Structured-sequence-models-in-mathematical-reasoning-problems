    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, we need to show that G is generated by a single element, say a, and that the order of G is 9.\n\nFirst, let's recall some facts about groups:\n\n1. The order of an element a in a group G is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n2. Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup H of a finite group G divides the order of G. In particular, the order of any element of G divides the order of G.\n\nNow, let's use these facts to prove that G is isomorphic to C9.\n\nWe are given that G is a group of order 9 and that there exists an element a in G such that a is not the identity element and a^3 is the identity element. This means that the order of a is 3.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of a (which is 3) must divide the order of G (which is 9). Since 3 is a divisor of 9, this condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H generated by a. Since the order of a is 3, H must have 3 elements: {e, a, a^2}. Since H is a subgroup of G, the order of H (which is 3) must also divide the order of G (which is 9). Again, this condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's show that G is generated by a. Since G has 9 elements and H has 3 elements, there must be 6 more elements in G that are not in H. Let's denote these elements as b, b^2, b^3, b^4, b^5, and b^6, where b is an element in G not in H and b^i denotes the i-th power of b.\n\nSince the order of G is 9, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of b must be a divisor of 9. The only divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The order of b cannot be 1, as that would mean b is the identity element, which is already in H. The order of b cannot be 3, as that would mean b generates a subgroup of order 3, and we would have two distinct subgroups of order 3 in G, which is not possible in a group of order 9.\n\nTherefore, the order of b must be 9. This means that G is generated by b, and the elements of G can be written as {e, b, b^2, b^3, b^4, b^5, b^6, b^7, b^8}. Since G is generated by a single element (b) and has order 9, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
