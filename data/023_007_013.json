    "message_1": "Let's say you have a signal f(t) that has a Fourier transform F(w). If the frequency content of the signal is between -20 Hz and 20 Hz, find the value of F(w) at w = 10 Hz.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of F(w) at w = 10 Hz, we need more information about the specific function f(t). The Fourier transform F(w) is dependent on the time-domain function f(t), and without knowing the form of f(t), we cannot determine the value of F(w) at w = 10 Hz.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the function f(t), I can help you find the value of F(w) at w = 10 Hz."
