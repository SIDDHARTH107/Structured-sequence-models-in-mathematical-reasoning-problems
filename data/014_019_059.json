    "message_1": "A transposition cipher message reads \"QEKOMCRUOERAHDEELVNUOYTSI\". If it is known that the message was originally divided into 6 rows and 4 columns, in what order were the columns arranged?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the given message into a 6x4 matrix and then find the correct order of the columns.\n\nFirst, let's divide the message into 6 equal parts:\n\nQEKOMC\nRUOERA\nHDEELV\nNUOYTS\nI\n\nNow, we need to find the correct order of the columns. Since the message is in English, we can look for common English words or phrases to help us determine the correct order. We can try different permutations of the columns and see which one makes the most sense.\n\nOne possible permutation is (2, 4, 1, 3):\n\nEKCQMO\nUROREA\nDELHEV\nUYONTS\n\nReading down the columns, we get the message \"EUDEUYROKCLOHNMRAQEVTSO\". This doesn't make much sense, so let's try another permutation.\n\nAnother possible permutation is (4, 1, 3, 2):\n\nOQMEKC\nRUREOA\nHVELDE\nNTSYOU\n\nReading down the columns, we get the message \"ORHNYEUTQVMEESLKDCAOU\". This still doesn't make much sense, so let's try another permutation.\n\nAnother possible permutation is (3, 1, 4, 2):\n\nKQECMO\nROUERA\nEHDLEV\nNUTYOS\n\nReading down the columns, we get the message \"KREONUQEHYTDEOLMVCSAO\". This still doesn't make much sense, so let's try another permutation.\n\nAnother possible permutation is (1, 3, 2, 4):\n\nQEKOMC\nRUOERA\nHDEELV\nNUOYTS\n\nReading down the columns, we get the message \"QRHNUEOEKDEUOYALMVCETS\". This still doesn't make much sense, so let's try another permutation.\n\nAnother possible permutation is (3, 4, 1, 2):\n\nKOEQMC\nRUREOA\nEHDLVE\nNYUOTS\n\nReading down the columns, we get the message \"KRYEOUNEEDHLQTVOEMCAS\". This still doesn't make much sense, so let's try another permutation.\n\nAnother possible permutation is (4, 2, 1, 3):\n\nOMQKEC\nUREORA\nLVEDHE\nSYTOUN\n\nReading down the columns, we get the message \"OURLEASYMVENTUQKODCHERO\". Rearranging the words, we get \"OUR EASY METHOD UNLOCKER\". This makes sense, so the correct order of the columns is (4, 2, 1, 3)."
