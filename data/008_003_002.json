    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Multiply the second row by -1 to make the leading entry positive.\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -3 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nStep 3: Add the second row to the third row.\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nNow we have the row echelon form of matrix A. There are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of matrix A is 2."
