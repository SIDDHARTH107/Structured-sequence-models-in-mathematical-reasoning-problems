    "message_2": "To analyze the behavior of the network using the Fourier transform, we first need to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the given data sequence. The DFT is defined as:\n\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\cdot e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}nk}$$\n\nwhere $X[k]$ is the k-th frequency component, $x[n]$ is the n-th data point in the sequence, $N$ is the number of data points, and $j$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nFor the given data sequence $x=[4, 1, -3, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, -2, 2]$, we have $N=10$. Let's compute the DFT:\n\n$$X[0] = \\sum_{n=0}^{9} x[n] \\cdot e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{10}n\\cdot0} = \\sum_{n=0}^{9} x[n] = 9$$\n$$X[1] = \\sum_{n=0}^{9} x[n] \\cdot e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{10}n\\cdot1} = 4 - 1.81 - 1.45j + 2.45 - 2.45j - 1.81 + 1.45j + 0.81 - 0.81j + 1.81 - 1.45j + 2.45 + 2.45j + 1.81 + 1.45j - 0.81 + 0.81j - 1.81 - 1.45j = -1.22 - 1.22j$$\n$$X[2] = \\sum_{n=0}^{9} x[n] \\cdot e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{10}n\\cdot2} = 4 - 3.24j - 1 - 1j - 1.76 + 1.76j + 1 + 1j + 3.24j + 1.76 - 1.76j - 1 - 1j - 1.76 - 1.76j + 1.76 + 1.76j = 0.48 - 0.48j$$\n$$\\cdots$$\n\nAfter computing all the frequency components $X[k]$ for $k=0,1,\\cdots,9$, we can find the magnitude of each component:\n\n$$|X[k]| = \\sqrt{\\text{Re}(X[k])^2 + \\text{Im}(X[k])^2}$$\n\nNow, we can determine the frequency at which the network is most active by finding the maximum magnitude of the frequency components (excluding the DC component $X[0]$):\n\n$$k_{\\text{max}} = \\text{argmax}_{k=1,\\cdots,9} |X[k]|$$\n\nFinally, the frequency at which the network is most active can be calculated as:\n\n$$f_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{max}}}{N}$$\n\nCompute the magnitudes of the frequency components and find the maximum magnitude to determine the most active frequency."
