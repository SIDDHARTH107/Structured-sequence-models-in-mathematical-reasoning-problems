    "message_2": "There is only 1 Jack of Hearts in a standard deck of 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing the Jack of Hearts from a well-shuffled deck is:\n\n1 (the number of Jack of Hearts) / 52 (the total number of cards in the deck) = 1/52 â‰ˆ 0.01923 or 1.923%\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a Jack of Hearts from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is approximately 1.923%."
