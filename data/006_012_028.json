    "message_1": "The average number of robberies that occur in a particular neighborhood is 2 per day. What is the probability of 4 robberies occurring in the neighborhood in a given day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, robberies) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a fixed average rate (λ) of occurrence.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^x)) / x!\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x events occurring\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average rate of occurrence (in this case, 2 robberies per day)\n- x is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 4 robberies)\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(4) = (e^(-2) * (2^4)) / 4!\n\nP(4) = (0.13534 * 16) / 24\n\nP(4) = 2.16544 / 24\n\nP(4) ≈ 0.09023\n\nSo, the probability of 4 robberies occurring in the neighborhood in a given day is approximately 0.09023 or 9.023%."
