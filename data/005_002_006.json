    "message_1": "A statistician collected a random sample of 25 IQ scores from a certain population and computed a 95% confidence interval for the population mean, which was (90, 110). What is the margin of error for the sample mean?",
    "message_2": "The margin of error for a confidence interval is the difference between the upper limit and the sample mean or the difference between the sample mean and the lower limit, divided by 2. In this case, we have a 95% confidence interval for the population mean of (90, 110).\n\nFirst, we find the sample mean:\n\nSample mean = (Lower limit + Upper limit) / 2\nSample mean = (90 + 110) / 2\nSample mean = 200 / 2\nSample mean = 100\n\nNow, we calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of error = (Upper limit - Sample mean) / 2\nMargin of error = (110 - 100) / 2\nMargin of error = 10 / 2\nMargin of error = 5\n\nSo, the margin of error for the sample mean is 5."
