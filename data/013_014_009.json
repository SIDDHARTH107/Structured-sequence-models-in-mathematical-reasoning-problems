    "message_1": "Design a mechanism for selecting the winner of an auction for a painting, where there are three bidders with the following valuations: bidder A values the painting at $100, bidder B values the painting at $150 and bidder C values the painting at $200. The mechanism should be designed in such a way that it incentivizes bidders to bid their true valuations and selects the bidder with the highest valuation as the winner while ensuring that the winner pays the second-highest valuation (i.e., the mechanism should be efficient and truthful). Determine the payment made by the winner and the revenue earned by the seller.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Vickrey auction (also known as the second-price sealed-bid auction) to design a mechanism that incentivizes bidders to bid their true valuations and selects the bidder with the highest valuation as the winner while ensuring that the winner pays the second-highest valuation.\n\nIn a Vickrey auction, each bidder submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the price submitted by the second-highest bidder. This mechanism is efficient and truthful because it encourages bidders to bid their true valuations, as they do not have to worry about overpaying for the item.\n\nIn this case, the three bidders have the following valuations:\n\n- Bidder A: $100\n- Bidder B: $150\n- Bidder C: $200\n\nAssuming each bidder submits a sealed bid equal to their true valuation, the bids would be as follows:\n\n- Bidder A: $100\n- Bidder B: $150\n- Bidder C: $200\n\nBidder C has the highest bid and would win the auction. However, they would only pay the second-highest bid, which is $150 (submitted by Bidder B).\n\nTherefore, the payment made by the winner (Bidder C) is $150, and the revenue earned by the seller is also $150."
