    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, bidders typically submit bids below their actual valuations to avoid overpaying. However, predicting the exact bids each bidder will submit is difficult without more information on their bidding strategies. \n\nTo estimate the expected revenue, we can make some assumptions about the bidding behavior. One common assumption is that bidders will bid the midpoint between their valuation and the next highest valuation. This is a simplified assumption and may not reflect the actual bidding behavior, but it can provide a rough estimate of the expected revenue.\n\nUnder this assumption, the bids would be as follows:\n\nBidder 1: ($10,000 + $8,000) / 2 = $9,000\nBidder 2: ($8,000 + $6,000) / 2 = $7,000\nBidder 3: ($6,000 + $5,000) / 2 = $5,500\nBidder 4: ($5,000 + $3,000) / 2 = $4,000\nBidder 5: $3,000 (since there is no lower valuation, we assume they bid their own valuation)\n\nIn this scenario, Bidder 1 would win the auction with a bid of $9,000. Therefore, the expected revenue generated from this auction would be approximately $9,000. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate based on simplified assumptions about bidding behavior."
