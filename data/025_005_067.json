    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve, we need to find the points where both the partial derivatives with respect to x and y are zero. The singular points are the points where the curve is not smooth, and the tangent cannot be uniquely determined.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y:\n\n∂(x^3 + y^3 - 3xyz) / ∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂(x^3 + y^3 - 3xyz) / ∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both of these partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of equations. We can rewrite the first equation as:\n\nx^2 = yz\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x^2 into the second equation:\n\n(yz) - xz = y^2\n\nFactor out z:\n\nz(y - x) = y^2\n\nNow, we have three cases to consider:\n\n1) z = 0\n2) y = x\n3) y^2 = z(y - x)\n\nCase 1: z = 0\nIf z = 0, then from the equation x^2 = yz, we have x^2 = 0, which implies x = 0. Similarly, y^2 = 0, which implies y = 0. So, the point (0, 0, 0) is a singular point.\n\nCase 2: y = x\nIf y = x, then from the equation x^2 = yz, we have x^2 = xz, which implies z = x. So, the points on the line x = y = z are singular points.\n\nCase 3: y^2 = z(y - x)\nIf y ≠ x, then we can divide both sides by (y - x):\n\ny = z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the equation x^2 = yz:\n\nx^2 = z^2\n\nSo, x = z or x = -z. If x = z, then we are back to the case 2, where y = x = z. If x = -z, then we have:\n\ny = -x\n\nSo, the points on the line x = -y = z are singular points.\n\nIn conclusion, the singular points of the curve x^3 + y^3 = 3xyz are:\n\n1) The point (0, 0, 0)\n2) The points on the line x = y = z\n3) The points on the line x = -y = z"
