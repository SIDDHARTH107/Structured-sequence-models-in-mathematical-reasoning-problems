    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we first need to separate the data into two groups: one group with ages less than 6 and another group with ages greater than or equal to 6.\n\nGroup 1 (ages < 6): {4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5}\nGroup 2 (ages >= 6): {6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 7, 6}\n\nNow, we need to rank the ages in the combined data set:\n\n{4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7}\n\nRanks: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\n\nAssign the ranks to the original groups:\n\nGroup 1 ranks: {1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nGroup 2 ranks: {8, 9, 10, 14, 11, 12, 15, 13}\n\nCalculate the sum of the ranks for each group:\n\nSum of Group 1 ranks: 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\nSum of Group 2 ranks: 8 + 9 + 10 + 14 + 11 + 12 + 15 + 13 = 92\n\nNow, we need to calculate the test statistic (W) for the smaller group (Group 1):\n\nW = Sum of Group 1 ranks - (n1 * (n1 + 1)) / 2\nW = 28 - (7 * (7 + 1)) / 2\nW = 28 - (7 * 8) / 2\nW = 28 - 28\nW = 0\n\nThe test statistic W is 0. To determine whether the median age is significantly different from 6 years old with a 95% confidence level, we need to compare W to the critical value from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test table. For a sample size of 7 in Group 1 and 8 in Group 2, the critical value for a two-tailed test at a 95% confidence level is 13.\n\nSince W (0) is less than the critical value (13), we reject the null hypothesis that the median age is not significantly different from 6 years old. Therefore, we can conclude that the median age of these kindergarten students is significantly different from 6 years old with a 95% confidence level."
