Consider the structure M = (ℤ, <, +, x), where ℤ denotes the set of integers, < denotes the less-than relation, and + and x denote addition and multiplication, respectively. \n\nLet ϕ be the first-order formula defined by:\n\n∃ x ∃ y ( x ≠ y ∧ x < y ∧ ∀ z (z < y → z = x))\n\nCompute the truth value of the formula ϕ in the structure M.",
    "message_2": "To compute the truth value of the formula ϕ in the structure M, we need to determine if there exist integers x and y such that x ≠ y, x < y, and for all integers z, if z < y, then z = x.\n\nLet's consider the integers x = 0 and y = 1. We have:\n\n1. x ≠ y, since 0 ≠ 1.\n2. x < y, since 0 < 1.\n3. For any integer z, if z < y (i.e., z < 1), then z must be less than or equal to 0. The only integer that satisfies this condition is z = 0, which is equal to x.\n\nSince we have found integers x and y that satisfy the conditions of the formula ϕ, the truth value of ϕ in the structure M is true."
