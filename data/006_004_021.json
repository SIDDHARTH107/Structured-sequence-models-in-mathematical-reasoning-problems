    "message_2": "The probability of rolling a 4 or a 6 on a single roll of a fair six-sided die can be calculated by finding the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 4 or a 6) and dividing it by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nThere are 2 successful outcomes (rolling a 4 or a 6) and 6 possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 4 or a 6 is:\n\nP(4 or 6) = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a 4 or a 6 on a single roll of a fair six-sided die is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333."
