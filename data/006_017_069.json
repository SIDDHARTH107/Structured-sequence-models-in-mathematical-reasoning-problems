    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one accident involves a pedestrian, we can first find the probability that none of the accidents involve a pedestrian and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single accident does not involve a pedestrian is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (or 80%).\n\nFor 8 accidents, the probability that none of them involve a pedestrian is (0.80)^8.\n\n(0.80)^8 = 0.16777216\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one accident involves a pedestrian:\n\n1 - 0.16777216 = 0.83222784\n\nSo, the probability that at least one accident involves a pedestrian is approximately 0.832 or 83.22%."
