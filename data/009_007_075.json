    "message_1": "A vertical cylindrical tank has a diameter of 2 meters and a height of 3 meters. It is filled with water weighing 9,800 N/m³ up to a height of 2 meters. Consider the fluid flow at the bottom of the tank through a small hole of diameter 0.5 cm. Using Navier-Stokes equations, determine the speed of the water that is flowing out of the hole.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Torricelli's theorem, which is derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in a container with a hole. Torricelli's theorem states that the speed of the fluid flowing out of the hole is given by:\n\nv = √(2gh)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the fluid above the hole.\n\nIn this case, the height of the water in the tank is 2 meters. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the water flowing out of the hole as follows:\n\nv = √(2 * 9.81 m/s² * 2 m)\nv = √(39.24 m²/s²)\nv ≈ 6.26 m/s\n\nSo, the speed of the water flowing out of the hole is approximately 6.26 m/s."
