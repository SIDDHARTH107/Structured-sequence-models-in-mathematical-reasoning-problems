    "message_1": "A principal hires an agent to negotiate a contract with a client. The contract will generate $500,000 in revenue, but the agent's efforts determine exactly how much of that revenue ends up in the principal's pocket. The agent can exert low effort or high effort, resulting in $200,000 or $400,000 in profit for the principal, respectively. The agent's payoff is $50,000 for low effort and $100,000 for high effort. The agent's effort level is unobservable by the principal. What is the optimal strategy for the principal and the agent?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for the principal and the agent, we can analyze the situation using game theory. We will consider the payoffs for both the principal and the agent under different scenarios.\n\n1. If the agent exerts low effort:\n   - Principal's profit: $200,000\n   - Agent's payoff: $50,000\n\n2. If the agent exerts high effort:\n   - Principal's profit: $400,000\n   - Agent's payoff: $100,000\n\nSince the agent's effort level is unobservable by the principal, the principal needs to design an incentive contract that motivates the agent to exert high effort. Let's denote the agent's compensation under low effort as C_L and under high effort as C_H.\n\nThe agent will choose high effort if the difference in payoffs between high effort and low effort is greater than or equal to the difference in costs:\n\nC_H - C_L >= $100,000 - $50,000\n\nC_H - C_L >= $50,000\n\nNow, the principal wants to maximize their profit, which is the difference between the revenue generated and the agent's compensation. Under high effort, the principal's profit is:\n\n$400,000 - C_H\n\nTo ensure that the agent chooses high effort, the principal should set the compensation levels such that the inequality above is satisfied, while also maximizing their profit.\n\nOne possible solution is to set C_L = $50,000 and C_H = $100,000. In this case, the agent's payoff difference between high and low effort is exactly $50,000, which satisfies the inequality. The principal's profit under high effort would be $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy for the principal is to offer a contract with a compensation of $50,000 for low effort and $100,000 for high effort. The optimal strategy for the agent is to exert high effort, as it results in a higher payoff for them."
