    "message_1": "Suppose that $f(z)$ is an entire function (i.e., it is complex differentiable at every point of the complex plane). If $|f(z)|\\leq 100$ for all $z$, prove that $f(z)$ is a constant function. \n\nFurthermore, apply Liouville's theorem to rigorously prove that every non-constant polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "Proof that $f(z)$ is a constant function:\n\nSince $f(z)$ is an entire function, it can be represented by its Taylor series expansion about the origin:\n\n$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$\n\nwhere $a_n$ are the coefficients of the Taylor series. Now, consider the function $g(z) = f'(z)$. Since $f(z)$ is entire, so is $g(z)$. We can find the derivative of $f(z)$ using the Taylor series expansion:\n\n$g(z) = f'(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n z^{n-1}$\n\nNow, we are given that $|f(z)| \\leq 100$ for all $z$. We want to show that $g(z)$ is bounded as well. To do this, we will use the Cauchy integral formula for the derivative:\n\n$g(z) = \\frac{n!}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(w)}{(w-z)^{n+1}} dw$\n\nwhere $C$ is a circle centered at $z$ with radius $r$. Since $|f(w)| \\leq 100$, we have:\n\n$|g(z)| \\leq \\frac{n!}{2\\pi} \\oint_C \\frac{100}{|w-z|^{n+1}} |dw|$\n\nNow, let $r \\rightarrow \\infty$. The integral on the right-hand side will approach 0, which implies that $g(z)$ is bounded. By Liouville's theorem, a bounded entire function must be constant. Therefore, $g(z) = f'(z)$ is constant.\n\nSince the derivative of $f(z)$ is constant, it implies that $f(z)$ itself must be a constant function. This completes the proof that $f(z)$ is a constant function.\n\nNow, we will apply Liouville's theorem to prove that every non-constant polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane.\n\nLet $p(z)$ be a non-constant polynomial. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $p(z)$ has no roots in the complex plane. Then, the function $h(z) = \\frac{1}{p(z)}$ is well-defined and entire, as it is the reciprocal of an entire function with no zeros.\n\nSince $p(z)$ is a polynomial, its growth is dominated by its highest-degree term. As $|z| \\rightarrow \\infty$, the magnitude of the lower-degree terms becomes negligible compared to the highest-degree term. Therefore, $|p(z)| \\rightarrow \\infty$ as $|z| \\rightarrow \\infty$. This implies that $|h(z)| \\rightarrow 0$ as $|z| \\rightarrow \\infty$, which means that $h(z)$ is a bounded entire function.\n\nBy Liouville's theorem, a bounded entire function must be constant. However, this contradicts our assumption that $p(z)$ is a non-constant polynomial, since the constant function $h(z)$ would imply that $p(z)$ has no highest-degree term. Therefore, our assumption that $p(z)$ has no roots in the complex plane must be false, and every non-constant polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane."
