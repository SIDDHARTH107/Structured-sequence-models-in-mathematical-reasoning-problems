    "message_2": "Let's consider a point $Q=(x_1, x_1^2)$ on the parabolic curve $y=x^2$. The tangent line passing through point $Q$ and $P=(a,b)$ can be represented by the equation:\n\n$y - b = m(x - a)$, where $m$ is the slope of the tangent line.\n\nSince the tangent line touches the parabola at point $Q$, the slope of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the parabola at point $Q$. So, let's find the derivative of the parabola:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$.\n\nNow, we can find the slope of the tangent line at point $Q$:\n\n$m = 2x_1$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of $m$ into the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - b = 2x_1(x - a)$.\n\nSince the tangent line passes through point $Q$, we can substitute the coordinates of $Q$ into the equation:\n\n$x_1^2 - b = 2x_1(x_1 - a)$.\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for $x_1$:\n\n$x_1^2 - b = 2x_1^2 - 2ax_1$.\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n$x_1^2 - 2ax_1 + b = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x_1$. Since the line is tangent to the curve, there must be only one solution for $x_1$. Therefore, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be equal to zero:\n\n$D = (-2a)^2 - 4(1)(b) = 0$.\n\nSolve for $D$:\n\n$4a^2 - 4b = 0$.\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n$a^2 - b = 0$.\n\nNow, we can express $b$ in terms of $a$:\n\n$b = a^2$.\n\nNow, let's substitute this value of $b$ back into the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - a^2 = 2x_1(x - a)$.\n\nSince we know that $x_1^2 = b = a^2$, we can substitute this value of $x_1$ into the equation:\n\n$y - a^2 = 2\\sqrt{a^2}(x - a)$.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$y - a^2 = 2a(x - a)$.\n\nNow, we have the equation of the tangent line passing through point $P=(a,b)$ and touching the parabolic curve $y=x^2$:\n\n$y = 2a(x - a) + a^2$."
