    "message_2": "To compute the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ for $i = 0, 1, 2$, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for projective varieties. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$ and a hyperplane section $Y \\subset X$, the restriction map $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^i(Y, \\mathbb{Q})$ is an isomorphism for $i < n - 1$ and injective for $i = n - 1$.\n\nIn our case, $X$ is a smooth projective plane curve of dimension $1$. Let $Y$ be a hyperplane section of $X$. Then, by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have:\n\n1. $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^0(Y, \\mathbb{Q})$: Since $Y$ is a non-empty open subset of $X$, we have $H^0(Y, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$, and thus $\\dim H^0(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 1$.\n\n2. $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q})$: Since $X$ is a smooth projective curve, we can use the genus-degree formula to compute its genus $g$. The genus-degree formula states that $g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$, where $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, $d = 3$, so $g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1$. The dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is equal to $2g$, so $\\dim H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 2$.\n\n3. $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$: Since $X$ is a curve, its dimension is $1$, so there are no non-trivial cohomology groups for $i > 1$. Therefore, $\\dim H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\nIn summary, the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ for $i = 0, 1, 2$ are $1$, $2$, and $0$, respectively."
