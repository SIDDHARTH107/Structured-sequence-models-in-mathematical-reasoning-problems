    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation √(5x - 3) - 2 = 0, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(5x - 3) = 2\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(5x - 3))^2 = 2^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5x - 3 = 4\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nAdd 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\n5x = 7\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 7/5\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\nx = 7/5"
