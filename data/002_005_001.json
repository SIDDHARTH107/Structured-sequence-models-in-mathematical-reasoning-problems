    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 10 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: length = 8 cm, width = 6 cm, and height = 10 cm.\n\nDiagonal length = √(8² + 6² + 10²)\nDiagonal length = √(64 + 36 + 100)\nDiagonal length = √(200)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √(200) cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
