A random sample of 36 bottles is taken from the production line. What is the probability that the mean capacity of this sample is less than 490 milliliters?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the information:\n\nPopulation mean (μ) = 500 ml\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 20 ml\nSample size (n) = 36 bottles\n\nWe want to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is less than 490 ml.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nStandard deviation of sample mean (σx̄) = σ / √n\n\nσx̄ = 20 / √36\nσx̄ = 20 / 6\nσx̄ = 3.333 ml\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 490 ml. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σx̄\n\nz = (490 - 500) / 3.333\nz = -10 / 3.333\nz = -3\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -3. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability.\n\nP(z < -3) ≈ 0.0013\n\nSo, the probability that the mean capacity of the sample is less than 490 milliliters is approximately 0.0013 or 0.13%."
