    "message_2": "First, let's recall some facts about p-groups and their properties:\n\n1. A group of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, is called a p-group.\n2. Every p-group has a non-trivial center (i.e., a center with more than just the identity element).\n3. If G is a group of order p^n, then the number of elements of order p^k, where k is a positive integer, is a multiple of p-1.\n\nNow, let's consider the given group G of order 32. Since 32 = 2^5, G is a 2-group. By fact 2, the center of G, denoted by Z(G), is non-trivial. Let's denote the number of elements of order 2 or 4 in G as m. We are given that m is either even or odd.\n\nCase 1: m is even\n\nSince m is even, there must be an even number of elements of order 2 or 4 in G. By fact 3, the number of elements of order 2^k, where k is a positive integer, is a multiple of 2-1 = 1. So, there must be an even number of elements of order 2 and an even number of elements of order 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G. Since G is a 2-group, it can have at most one element of order 32 (the generator of a cyclic group of order 32). If G has an element of order 32, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C32, which is abelian. However, we are given that G is non-abelian, so G cannot have an element of order 32.\n\nThus, G must have elements of order 2, 4, and possibly 8. Since G is non-abelian, it cannot be a direct product of cyclic groups of order 2, 4, or 8. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nCase 2: m is odd\n\nIn this case, there must be an odd number of elements of order 2 or 4 in G. By fact 3, the number of elements of order 2^k, where k is a positive integer, is a multiple of 2-1 = 1. So, there must be an odd number of elements of order 2 and an odd number of elements of order 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G. If G has an element of order 32, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C32. If G does not have an element of order 32, then G must have elements of order 2, 4, and possibly 8. Since G is non-abelian, it cannot be a direct product of cyclic groups of order 2, 4, or 8. The only non-abelian group of order 32 with an odd number of elements of order 2 and an odd number of elements of order 4 is the dihedral group D16.\n\nTherefore, if the number of elements of G of order 2 or 4 is odd, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32 or the dihedral group D16."
