    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively subdividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the central square at each stage. \n\nIn the first stage (n=1), there is 1 square removed.\nIn the second stage (n=2), there are 8 new squares formed, and each of them has a central square removed, so there are 8 more squares removed, making a total of 1 + 8 = 9 squares removed.\nIn the third stage (n=3), there are 8^2 = 64 new squares formed, and each of them has a central square removed, so there are 64 more squares removed, making a total of 1 + 8 + 64 = 73 squares removed.\nIn general, for the nth stage, there are 1 + 8 + 8^2 + ... + 8^(n-1) squares removed.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of squares removed in the 5th stage (n=5). Using the formula above:\n\nNumber of squares removed = 1 + 8 + 8^2 + 8^3 + 8^4\n= 1 + 8 + 64 + 512 + 4096\n= 4681\n\nSo, in the 5th stage of the Sierpinski carpet, 4681 squares need to be shaded."
