    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the proposition \"If Mary is not tall, then John is not smart,\" we need to analyze the given propositions P and Q. However, we do not have any information about the truth values of P and Q. Without knowing the truth values of P and Q, we cannot determine the truth value of the given proposition."
