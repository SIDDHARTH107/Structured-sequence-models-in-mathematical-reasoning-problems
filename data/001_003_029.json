    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n4x + 2y = 14 (1st equation multiplied by 2)\n3x - 2y = -10 (2nd equation)\n\nNow, we will add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(4x + 2y) + (3x - 2y) = 14 + (-10)\n7x = 4\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\nx = 4/7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into either of the original equations to solve for y. We will use the first equation:\n\n2(4/7) + y = 7\n\n8/7 + y = 7\n\nTo solve for y, subtract 8/7 from both sides:\n\ny = 7 - 8/7\ny = (49 - 8) / 7\ny = 41/7\n\nSo the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 4/7 and y = 41/7."
