    "message_2": "To determine the number of homotopy classes of maps f: S^3 → X, we can use the fact that the set of homotopy classes of maps between two topological spaces is in one-to-one correspondence with the homotopy groups of the target space. In this case, we are interested in the homotopy group π_3(X).\n\nSince X has cohomology groups H^(i)(X) with i=0,1,2,3, we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology to relate the cohomology groups to the homology groups. The Universal Coefficient Theorem states that there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H_i(X), Z) → H^(i+1)(X) → Hom(H_i(X), Z) → 0\n\nIn our case, we have H^(0)(X) = H^(1)(X) = H^(2)(X) = Z and H^(3)(X) = 0. We can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem to find the homology groups H_i(X) for i=0,1,2,3.\n\nFor i=0, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H_0(X), Z) → H^(1)(X) → Hom(H_0(X), Z) → 0\n\nSince H^(1)(X) = Z, we have Hom(H_0(X), Z) = Z. This implies that H_0(X) = Z.\n\nFor i=1, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H_1(X), Z) → H^(2)(X) → Hom(H_1(X), Z) → 0\n\nSince H^(2)(X) = Z, we have Hom(H_1(X), Z) = Z. This implies that H_1(X) = Z.\n\nFor i=2, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H_2(X), Z) → H^(3)(X) → Hom(H_2(X), Z) → 0\n\nSince H^(3)(X) = 0, we have Ext(H_2(X), Z) = 0. This implies that H_2(X) = Z.\n\nNow, we can use the Hurewicz theorem to relate the homotopy groups π_i(X) to the homology groups H_i(X) for i=0,1,2,3. The Hurewicz theorem states that if π_i(X) = 0 for i < n, then the Hurewicz homomorphism h: π_n(X) → H_n(X) is an isomorphism.\n\nIn our case, we have H_0(X) = H_1(X) = H_2(X) = Z. Since H_0(X) and H_1(X) are nontrivial, the Hurewicz theorem does not apply directly. However, we can still use the Hurewicz theorem for i=2, since π_0(X) and π_1(X) do not affect the higher homotopy groups.\n\nFor i=2, we have h: π_2(X) → H_2(X) is an isomorphism. Since H_2(X) = Z, we have π_2(X) = Z.\n\nNow, we can use the suspension isomorphism to relate the homotopy groups π_i(X) to π_(i-1)(ΣX), where ΣX is the suspension of X. The suspension isomorphism states that π_(i-1)(ΣX) ≅ π_i(X) for i > 0.\n\nIn our case, we have π_2(X) = Z. Therefore, π_1(ΣX) = Z.\n\nFinally, we can use the Freudenthal suspension theorem to relate the homotopy groups π_i(X) to π_(i+1)(X) for i > 0. The Freudenthal suspension theorem states that if X is an (n-1)-connected space, then the suspension homomorphism s: π_i(X) → π_(i+1)(ΣX) is an isomorphism for i < 2n.\n\nIn our case, X is 1-connected (since π_0(X) is trivial and π_1(X) is nontrivial), so the Freudenthal suspension theorem applies for i < 2. Therefore, s: π_2(X) → π_3(ΣX) is an isomorphism.\n\nSince π_2(X) = Z and π_1(ΣX) = Z, we have π_3(ΣX) = Z. Now, we can use the suspension isomorphism again to relate π_3(ΣX) to π_4(X). We have π_3(ΣX) ≅ π_4(X), so π_4(X) = Z.\n\nHowever, we are interested in the homotopy group π_3(X), not π_4(X). Since we have no information about π_3(X) from the given cohomology groups, we cannot determine the number of homotopy classes of maps f: S^3 → X using the given information."
