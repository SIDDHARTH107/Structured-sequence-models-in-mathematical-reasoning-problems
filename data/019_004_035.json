    "message_2": "In temporal logic, we can use the \"Until\" operator (denoted by 'U') to express that a certain event occurs before another event. In this case, we want to express that event A occurred before event B. We can represent the events A and B as propositions p and q, respectively.\n\nThe statement \"A occurred before B\" can be expressed in temporal logic as:\n\np U q"
