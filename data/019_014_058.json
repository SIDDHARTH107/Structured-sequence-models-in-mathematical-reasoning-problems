    "message_2": "The given statement can be expressed using quantifiers and logical connectives as follows:\n\n∃x ∈ ℕ, ∀y ∈ ℕ, (P(y) → (x ≤ y))\n\nNow, let's find the negation of the statement:\n\n¬(∃x ∈ ℕ, ∀y ∈ ℕ, (P(y) → (x ≤ y)))\n\nUsing the rules of negation, we can rewrite this as:\n\n∀x ∈ ℕ, ∃y ∈ ℕ, ¬(P(y) → (x ≤ y))\n\nNow, let's simplify the negation of the implication:\n\n¬(P(y) → (x ≤ y)) ≡ (P(y) ∧ ¬(x ≤ y))\n\nSo, the negation of the statement is:\n\n∀x ∈ ℕ, ∃y ∈ ℕ, (P(y) ∧ ¬(x ≤ y))\n\nTo show that the negation of the statement is true, we would need to provide a specific example of P(x) where the negation holds. However, since we don't have any information about the properties of P(x), we cannot prove that the negation of the statement is true in general."
