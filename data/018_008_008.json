    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nGiven the sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}, we can find their Cartesian product A x B as follows:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product B x A:\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements in A x B and B x A are different, even though they have the same number of elements. The order of the elements in the ordered pairs is not the same, which shows that A x B is not equal to B x A."
