    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve that was first described by Giuseppe Peano in 1890. It is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square grid. The curve is constructed iteratively, with each iteration refining the previous one.\n\nTo construct the Peano curve for a given number of iterations, we can use the following general formula:\n\n1. Start with the first iteration, which is a simple U-shaped curve with three segments: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0).\n\n2. For each subsequent iteration, replace each segment of the previous iteration with a scaled-down version of the first iteration curve. Specifically, if the segment connects points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), replace it with the curve that connects (x1, y1) -> (x1 + (x2 - x1)/3, y1 + (y2 - y1)/3) -> (x1 + 2*(x2 - x1)/3, y1 + 2*(y2 - y1)/3) -> (x2, y2).\n\n3. Repeat step 2 for the desired number of iterations.\n\nFor example, to construct the Peano curve up to four iterations, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the first iteration: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0).\n\n2. Replace each segment with a scaled-down version of the first iteration curve:\n\n   - (0,0) -> (0,1/3) -> (1/3,1/3) -> (1/3,0)\n   - (0,1/3) -> (0,2/3) -> (1/3,2/3) -> (1/3,1/3)\n   - (0,2/3) -> (0,1) -> (1/3,1) -> (1/3,2/3)\n   - (1/3,1/3) -> (2/3,1/3) -> (2/3,2/3) -> (1/3,2/3)\n   - (1/3,2/3) -> (2/3,2/3) -> (2/3,1) -> (1/3,1)\n   - (1/3,0) -> (2/3,0) -> (2/3,1/3) -> (1,1/3)\n   - (2/3,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1/3) -> (2/3,1/3)\n   - (2/3,1/3) -> (1,1/3) -> (1,2/3) -> (2/3,2/3)\n   - (2/3,2/3) -> (1,2/3) -> (1,1) -> (2/3,1)\n\n3. Repeat step 2 for two more iterations to reach the fourth iteration.\n\nNote that this process generates the coordinates of the curve, but it does not provide an explicit formula for the curve itself. The Peano curve is a fractal, and its construction is inherently iterative."
