    "message_2": "Using treewidth theory is not necessary to solve this problem, as it can be solved with simple arithmetic.\n\nGiven that each bag can hold a maximum of 20 books, we can calculate the minimum number of bags required to hold all the books in the library as follows:\n\nTotal number of books = 100\nMaximum books per bag = 20\n\nMinimum number of bags = Total number of books / Maximum books per bag\nMinimum number of bags = 100 / 20\nMinimum number of bags = 5\n\nSo, the minimum number of bags required to hold all the books in the library is 5. The categories of the books do not affect the number of bags needed in this case, as we are only concerned with the total number of books and the capacity of each bag."
