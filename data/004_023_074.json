    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves, we first need to find the points where the curves intersect. We can do this by setting y = x^2 equal to y = 2x - 1 and solving for x:\n\nx^2 = 2x - 1\nx^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\n(x - 1)^2 = 0\nx = 1\n\nSo the two curves intersect at x = 1. Now, we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. We will integrate the difference between the two functions from -1 to 1, and then from 1 to 2:\n\nArea = ∫[-1, 1] (2x - 1 - x^2) dx + ∫[1, 2] (x^2 - 2x + 1) dx\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivatives of the functions:\n\nFor the first integral:\nF(x) = x^2 - (1/3)x^3 - x | from -1 to 1\n\nFor the second integral:\nG(x) = (1/3)x^3 - x^2 + x | from 1 to 2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integrals:\n\nArea = [((1)^2 - (1/3)(1)^3 - 1) - ((-1)^2 - (1/3)(-1)^3 - (-1))] + [((1/3)(2)^3 - (2)^2 + 2) - ((1/3)(1)^3 - (1)^2 + 1)]\n\nArea = [(1 - (1/3) - 1) - (1 + (1/3) + 1)] + [(8/3 - 4 + 2) - (1/3 - 1 + 1)]\n\nArea = [(-1/3) - (5/3)] + [(2/3)]\n\nArea = (-2) + (2/3)\n\nArea = -4/3\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = |-4/3| = 4/3\n\nSo, the area between the two curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 1 for x between -1 and 2 is 4/3 square units."
