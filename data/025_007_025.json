Calculate the cohomology groups $H^i(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},\\mathcal{I})$ for $i=0,1,2$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups, we will use the Čech cohomology. We will cover the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ with two open sets: $U_1 = \\mathbb{C}$ and $U_2 = \\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\} - \\{0\\}$. Note that $U_1 \\cap U_2 = \\mathbb{C} - \\{0\\}$.\n\nNow, we will compute the Čech complex for this cover. For $i=0$, we have:\n\n$C^0(\\mathcal{I}) = \\mathcal{I}(U_1) \\oplus \\mathcal{I}(U_2)$.\n\n$\\mathcal{I}(U_1)$ consists of holomorphic functions on $\\mathbb{C}$ that vanish at $\\infty$. These are precisely the entire functions that are also polynomial, so $\\mathcal{I}(U_1) = \\mathbb{C}[z]$.\n\n$\\mathcal{I}(U_2)$ consists of holomorphic functions on $U_2$ that vanish at $\\infty$. We can use the change of coordinates $w = 1/z$ to rewrite these functions as holomorphic functions on $\\mathbb{C} - \\{0\\}$ that vanish at $0$. These are precisely the functions of the form $f(w) = w^n g(w)$ for some $n \\geq 1$ and $g(w)$ holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{I}(U_2) = \\bigoplus_{n\\geq 1} \\mathbb{C}[w]w^n$.\n\nFor $i=1$, we have:\n\n$C^1(\\mathcal{I}) = \\mathcal{I}(U_1 \\cap U_2)$.\n\n$\\mathcal{I}(U_1 \\cap U_2)$ consists of holomorphic functions on $\\mathbb{C} - \\{0\\}$ that vanish at $\\infty$. These are precisely the functions of the form $f(z) = z^n g(z)$ for some $n \\geq 1$ and $g(z)$ holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{I}(U_1 \\cap U_2) = \\bigoplus_{n\\geq 1} \\mathbb{C}[z]z^n$.\n\nFor $i \\geq 2$, we have $C^i(\\mathcal{I}) = 0$ since there are no nonempty intersections of three or more sets in our cover.\n\nNow, we compute the coboundary maps. The only nontrivial map is $d^0: C^0(\\mathcal{I}) \\to C^1(\\mathcal{I})$. Given a pair of functions $(f_1(z), f_2(w)) \\in C^0(\\mathcal{I})$, we have:\n\n$d^0(f_1(z), f_2(w)) = f_2(w) - f_1(z)$ on $U_1 \\cap U_2$.\n\nThe kernel of $d^0$ consists of pairs $(f_1(z), f_2(w))$ such that $f_2(w) = f_1(z)$ on $U_1 \\cap U_2$. This is equivalent to the condition that $f_1(z)$ and $f_2(w)$ have the same Laurent expansion at $z=0$. Since both functions vanish at $\\infty$, this means that $f_1(z) = f_2(w) = 0$. Thus, $\\ker d^0 = \\{(0, 0)\\}$.\n\nThe image of $d^0$ consists of functions of the form $f(z) = z^n g(z)$ for some $n \\geq 1$ and $g(z)$ holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus, $\\operatorname{im} d^0 = \\mathcal{I}(U_1 \\cap U_2)$.\n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology groups:\n\n$H^0(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},\\mathcal{I}) = \\ker d^0 = \\{(0, 0)\\}$, which is a one-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n$H^1(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},\\mathcal{I}) = \\frac{\\ker d^1}{\\operatorname{im} d^0} = \\frac{0}{\\mathcal{I}(U_1 \\cap U_2)} = 0$.\n\n$H^2(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},\\mathcal{I}) = 0$, since $C^2(\\mathcal{I}) = 0$.\n\nSo, the cohomology groups are:\n\n$H^0(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},\\mathcal{I}) = \\mathbb{C}$,\n$H^1(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},\\mathcal{I}) = 0$,\n$H^2(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},\\mathcal{I}) = 0$."
