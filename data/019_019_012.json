    "message_2": "The Church-Turing thesis is a statement about the nature of computability, stating that any function that can be computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine. It is not a mathematical formula or equation that can be evaluated for a specific value. \n\nHowever, if you are asking about the computational power of a two-state, four-symbol Turing machine, it is limited compared to more complex Turing machines. It can perform simple computations and recognize certain languages, but it cannot simulate the behavior of a universal Turing machine, which can simulate any other Turing machine."
