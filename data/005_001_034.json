    "message_1": "A company claims that their average response time to customer complaints is less than 30 minutes. To test this claim, a sample of 50 customer complaints is taken and the sample mean response time is 28 minutes with a standard deviation of 4 minutes. Using a significance level of 0.05, can we reject the company's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average response time is equal to or greater than 30 minutes, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average response time is less than 30 minutes.\n\nH0: μ ≥ 30\nH1: μ < 30\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 28 minutes\nSample standard deviation (s) = 4 minutes\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (28 - 30) / (4 / √50)\nt = -2 / (4 / √50)\nt = -2 / (4 / 7.071)\nt = -2 / 0.5657\nt ≈ -3.54\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.68.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.54) is less than the critical t-value (-1.68), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Therefore, we have enough evidence to support the company's claim that their average response time to customer complaints is less than 30 minutes at a 0.05 significance level."
