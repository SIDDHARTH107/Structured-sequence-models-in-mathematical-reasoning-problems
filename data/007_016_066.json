    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. A palindromic prime is a prime number that remains prime when its digits are reversed.\n\nThe smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a palindrome is 11. This is because 11 is a prime number, and 2(11) + 1 = 23, which is also prime. Additionally, 11 is a palindrome as its digits remain the same when reversed."
