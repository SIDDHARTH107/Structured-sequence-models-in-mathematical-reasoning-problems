    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. \n\nLet A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. We can compute the Cartesian product A x B as follows:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's compute the Cartesian product of B and A, which is B x A:\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that A x B is not equal to B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nThe elements in A x B are not the same as the elements in B x A. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
