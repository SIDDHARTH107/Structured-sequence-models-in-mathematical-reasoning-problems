    "message_2": "To find the y-intercept, we need to find the value of y when x = 0. So, we plug x = 0 into the equation:\n\ny = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 - 27(0) + 90\ny = 0 - 0 - 0 + 90\ny = 90\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 90).\n\nTo find the zeros of the polynomial equation, we need to find the values of x when y = 0:\n\n0 = x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 90\n\nWe can try to factor this equation or use synthetic division to find the zeros. In this case, we can notice that x = 3 is a zero:\n\n0 = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 - 27(3) + 90\n0 = 27 - 54 - 81 + 90\n0 = 0\n\nNow, we can use synthetic division to find the remaining zeros:\n\nDivide (x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 90) by (x - 3):\n\n        ______________________\nx - 3 | x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 90\n        - (x^3 - 3x^2)\n        ______________________\n                 -3x^2 - 27x\n                 - (-3x^2 + 9x)\n        ______________________\n                          -36x + 90\n                          - (-36x + 108)\n        ______________________\n                                    -18\n                                    \nSo, the result is x^2 - 3x - 18. Now, we can factor this quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 3x - 18 = (x - 6)(x + 3)\n\nSo, the zeros of the polynomial equation are x = 3, x = 6, and x = -3.\n\nNow, we can graph the function:\n\n1. Plot the y-intercept (0, 90).\n2. Plot the zeros (3, 0), (6, 0), and (-3, 0).\n3. Since the leading term is x^3, the function will have a cubic shape.\n4. Connect the points with a smooth curve, making sure the curve passes through the y-intercept and zeros.\n\nThe graph of the function y = x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 90 will show a cubic curve passing through the points (0, 90), (3, 0), (6, 0), and (-3, 0)."
