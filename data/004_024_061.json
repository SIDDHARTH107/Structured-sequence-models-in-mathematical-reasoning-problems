    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve on Using the chain rule to differentiate implicit functions in Calculus:\n\nGiven that the equation x^2 + xy + y^2 = 9, find the derivative of y with respect to x at the point where x = 2.\n\nHint: Use the chain rule to differentiate the left side of the equation, treating y as a function of x.",
    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nGiven equation: x^2 + xy + y^2 = 9\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^2) + d/dx(xy) + d/dx(y^2) = d/dx(9)\n\nUsing the chain rule and product rule where necessary:\n\n2x + (1*y + x*dy/dx) + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 2. We can plug x = 2 back into the original equation:\n\n(2)^2 + (2)(y) + y^2 = 9\n\n4 + 2y + y^2 = 9\n\ny^2 + 2y - 5 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n(y + 5)(y - 1) = 0\n\nSo, y = -5 or y = 1. Since we're looking for the derivative at the point where x = 2, we'll choose the value y = 1 (as it is more likely to be in the same region).\n\nNow we have the point (2, 1). We'll plug these values back into the differentiated equation to find the derivative dy/dx:\n\n2(2) + (1)(1) + (2)(1)(dy/dx) = 0\n\n4 + 1 + 4(dy/dx) = 0\n\n4(dy/dx) = -5\n\ndy/dx = -5/4\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at the point (2, 1) is -5/4."
