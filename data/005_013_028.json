The following table shows the results:\n\n| Student | Hours of study per week | Math Grade | English Grade | Science Grade |\n|---------|------------------------|------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1       | 2                      | 78         | 82            | 85            |\n| 2       | 3                      | 81         | 85            | 87            |\n| 3       | 4                      | 84         | 89            | 90            |\n| ...     | ...                    | ...        | ...           | ...           |\n| 50      | 6                      | 90         | 94            | 96            |\n\nUsing multivariate analysis techniques, determine if there is a relationship between the number of hours studied per week and the grades obtained in these three subjects.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a relationship between the number of hours studied per week and the grades obtained in Math, English, and Science, we can use multivariate regression analysis. In this case, we will treat the hours of study per week as the independent variable (X) and the grades in Math, English, and Science as the dependent variables (Y1, Y2, and Y3, respectively).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean of the independent variable (X) and the dependent variables (Y1, Y2, and Y3):\n\nMean of Hours of study per week (X) = ΣX / n\nMean of Math Grade (Y1) = ΣY1 / n\nMean of English Grade (Y2) = ΣY2 / n\nMean of Science Grade (Y3) = ΣY3 / n\n\nWhere n is the number of students (50 in this case).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the covariance between the independent variable and each dependent variable:\n\nCov(X, Y1) = Σ[(X - Mean of X) * (Y1 - Mean of Y1)] / (n - 1)\nCov(X, Y2) = Σ[(X - Mean of X) * (Y2 - Mean of Y2)] / (n - 1)\nCov(X, Y3) = Σ[(X - Mean of X) * (Y3 - Mean of Y3)] / (n - 1)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the variance of the independent variable (X):\n\nVar(X) = Σ(X - Mean of X)^2 / (n - 1)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the regression coefficients (B1, B2, and B3) for each dependent variable:\n\nB1 = Cov(X, Y1) / Var(X)\nB2 = Cov(X, Y2) / Var(X)\nB3 = Cov(X, Y3) / Var(X)\n\nThese regression coefficients will tell us the relationship between the number of hours studied per week and the grades obtained in Math, English, and Science. If the coefficients are positive, it indicates a positive relationship (i.e., as the number of hours studied per week increases, the grades in the respective subjects also increase). If the coefficients are negative, it indicates a negative relationship (i.e., as the number of hours studied per week increases, the grades in the respective subjects decrease).\n\nHowever, since the data provided in the question is incomplete, we cannot perform the actual calculations. If you provide the complete data, we can perform the multivariate regression analysis and determine the relationship between the number of hours studied per week and the grades obtained in Math, English, and Science."
