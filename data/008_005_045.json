    "message_2": "To solve the non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second and third equations:\n\n-2(x + y + z) = -2(6)\n-2x - 2y - 2z = -12\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n(2x + y - z) + (-2x - 2y - 2z) = 0 + (-12)\n- y - 3z = -12  (1)\n\nAnd add it to the third equation:\n(2x + 3y + z) + (-2x - 2y - 2z) = 10 + (-12)\ny - z = -2  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n- y - 3z = -12\n  y - z = -2\n\nWe can solve this system by adding the two equations:\n\n- y - 3z + y - z = -12 - 2\n-4z = -14\n\nNow, divide by -4:\n\nz = 14/4 = 7/2\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it into equation (2) to find the value of y:\n\ny - (7/2) = -2\ny = -2 + 7/2\ny = -4/2 + 7/2\ny = 3/2\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\nx + (3/2) + (7/2) = 6\nx + 10/2 = 6\nx = 6 - 5\nx = 1\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 3/2, and z = 7/2."
