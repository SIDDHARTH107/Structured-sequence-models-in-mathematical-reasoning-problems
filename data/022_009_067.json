    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x+3)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^2+1}}{\\frac{(x+3)^n}{n^2+1}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x+3)(n^2+1)}{(n+1)^2+1}\\right|$$\n\nNow, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $n^2$ to get:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x+3)(1+\\frac{1}{n^2})}{(1+\\frac{1}{n})^2+\\frac{1}{n^2}}\\right|$$\n\nAs $n$ approaches infinity, the terms with $n$ in the denominator will approach 0:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x+3)(1+0)}{(1+0)^2+0}\\right| = |x+3|$$\n\nFor the series to converge, we need this limit to be less than 1:\n\n$$|x+3| < 1$$\n\nThis inequality represents the interval of convergence. To find the endpoints, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$$-1 < x+3 < 1$$\n$$-4 < x < -2$$\n\nThus, the interval of convergence is $(-4, -2)$. The radius of convergence is half the length of this interval, which is:\n\n$$R = \\frac{-2 - (-4)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\n\nSo, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is $(-4, -2)$."
