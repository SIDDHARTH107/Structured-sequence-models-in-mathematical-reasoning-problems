    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire's center, we can use Ampere's law. For a long straight wire carrying a current I, the magnetic field B at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nIn this problem, the current I is 10 A, and the distance r is 2 cm (0.02 m) from the wire's center.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-6) T) / (0.04 m)\n\nB = 10^(-4) T / 0.04\n\nB ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-3) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire's center is approximately 2.5 × 10^(-3) T (tesla)."
