    "message_2": "The total perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (starting length) * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the starting length is 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter after the 5th iteration. So, n = 5.\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^5) = 1 * 32 = 32 units\n\nThe total perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after the 5th iteration is 32 units."
