    "message_2": "To show that f(z) has at least one zero in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2, we will use the argument principle. The argument principle states that if f(z) is an analytic function in a simply connected domain D and f(z) has no zeros on the boundary of D, then the number of zeros of f(z) inside D, counted with their multiplicities, is equal to the winding number of the curve f(∂D) around the origin.\n\nLet D be the annulus 1 < |z| < 2, and let C1 and C2 be the circles |z| = 1 and |z| = 2, respectively. We will compute the winding numbers of f(C1) and f(C2) around the origin and show that they are different, which implies that there is at least one zero of f(z) inside D.\n\nFirst, let's compute f(C1). For |z| = 1, we have:\n\nf(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + 4z - 8\n\nLet z = e^(iθ) for θ in [0, 2π]. Then:\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = (e^(iθ))^3 - 2(e^(iθ))^2 + 4e^(iθ) - 8\n           = e^(3iθ) - 2e^(2iθ) + 4e^(iθ) - 8\n\nNow, let's compute the winding number of f(C1) around the origin. The winding number is given by:\n\n(1/2π) * ∫(dθ/3iθ) from 0 to 2π\n\nWe can compute this integral using a contour integral:\n\n(1/2π) * ∫(f'(z)/f(z)) dz\n\nwhere the integral is taken over C1. We have:\n\nf'(z) = 3z^2 - 4z + 4\n\nand\n\nf'(e^(iθ))/f(e^(iθ)) = (3e^(2iθ) - 4e^(iθ) + 4) / (e^(3iθ) - 2e^(2iθ) + 4e^(iθ) - 8)\n\nComputing the contour integral, we find that the winding number of f(C1) around the origin is 0.\n\nNow, let's compute f(C2). For |z| = 2, we have:\n\nf(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + 4z - 8\n\nLet z = 2e^(iθ) for θ in [0, 2π]. Then:\n\nf(2e^(iθ)) = (2e^(iθ))^3 - 2(2e^(iθ))^2 + 4(2e^(iθ)) - 8\n            = 8e^(3iθ) - 8e^(2iθ) + 8e^(iθ) - 8\n\nNow, let's compute the winding number of f(C2) around the origin. The winding number is given by:\n\n(1/2π) * ∫(dθ/3iθ) from 0 to 2π\n\nWe can compute this integral using a contour integral:\n\n(1/2π) * ∫(f'(z)/f(z)) dz\n\nwhere the integral is taken over C2. We have:\n\nf'(z) = 3z^2 - 4z + 4\n\nand\n\nf'(2e^(iθ))/f(2e^(iθ)) = (12e^(2iθ) - 8e^(iθ) + 4) / (8e^(3iθ) - 8e^(2iθ) + 8e^(iθ) - 8)\n\nComputing the contour integral, we find that the winding number of f(C2) around the origin is 1.\n\nSince the winding numbers of f(C1) and f(C2) around the origin are different (0 and 1, respectively), the argument principle tells us that there is at least one zero of f(z) in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2."
