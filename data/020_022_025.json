    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $50,000 to allocate between two advertising strategies: social media ads and TV ads. The cost of each social media ad is $50 and the cost of each TV ad is $500. Based on previous data, they expect to receive a return on investment (ROI) of $5 for each social media ad and $100 for each TV ad. However, the company wants to ensure that they maximize their ROI while staying within their budget. How many social media ads and TV ads should they invest in to achieve their objective?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of social media ads and y be the number of TV ads. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. The total cost of the ads should not exceed the budget of $50,000:\n50x + 500y ≤ 50,000\n\n2. The number of ads should be non-negative:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective is to maximize the ROI, which is given by the following equation:\nROI = 5x + 100y\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use linear programming. First, we can rearrange the budget constraint equation to make y the subject:\n\n500y ≤ 50,000 - 50x\ny ≤ 100 - 0.1x\n\nNow, we can graph the constraint and find the feasible region. Since x and y are both non-negative, the feasible region will be in the first quadrant. The line y = 100 - 0.1x is the boundary of the feasible region, and the region below this line represents the combinations of x and y that satisfy the budget constraint.\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can analyze the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region. The vertices are (0, 0), (0, 100), and (1000, 0).\n\n1. At (0, 0): ROI = 5(0) + 100(0) = 0\n2. At (0, 100): ROI = 5(0) + 100(100) = 10,000\n3. At (1000, 0): ROI = 5(1000) + 100(0) = 5,000\n\nThe maximum ROI is achieved at the vertex (0, 100), with a value of 10,000. Therefore, the company should invest in 0 social media ads and 100 TV ads to maximize their ROI while staying within their budget."
