    "message_1": "A company has 5 offices in different cities. Each office can communicate directly with 2 other offices. How many direct communication links among these 5 offices exist?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of direct communication links, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of offices and k is the number of offices each office can communicate with.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 and k = 2. So, we have:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2! * 3!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2 * 6)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nThere are 10 direct communication links among the 5 offices."
