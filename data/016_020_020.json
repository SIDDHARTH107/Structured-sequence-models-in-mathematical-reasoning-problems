    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively removing smaller tetrahedra from the initial larger tetrahedron. In this case, the initial tetrahedron has an edge length of 4 units.\n\nTo construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron, we first remove the central tetrahedron from the initial tetrahedron, which has an edge length of 4/2 = 2 units. This leaves us with 4 smaller tetrahedra, each with an edge length of 2 units.\n\nNext, we remove the central tetrahedron from each of these 4 smaller tetrahedra, leaving us with 4 * 4 = 16 even smaller tetrahedra, each with an edge length of 2/2 = 1 unit.\n\nAt this point, we have reached the smallest possible tetrahedra with an edge length of 1 unit, so we cannot continue the process further.\n\nTherefore, the total number of identical smaller tetrahedra required to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron with an initial edge length of 4 units is 16."
