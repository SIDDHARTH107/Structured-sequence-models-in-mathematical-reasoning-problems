    "message_2": "First, let's find B ∩ {2}. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, B ∩ {2} = {2} since 2 is the only element common to both B and {2}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. A × (B ∩ {2})\nA × {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\n2. (A × B) ∩ (A × {2})\nFirst, we need to find A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, we find A × {2}:\nA × {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\nFinally, we find the intersection of (A × B) and (A × {2}):\n(A × B) ∩ (A × {2}) = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\nWe can see that A × (B ∩ {2}) = (A × B) ∩ (A × {2}) = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}.\n\nNow, let's prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection using these examples.\n\nLet C and D be two sets. We want to show that A × (C ∩ D) = (A × C) ∩ (A × D).\n\nIn our example, A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {2, 4}, C = B, and D = {2}. We have already found that A × (B ∩ {2}) = (A × B) ∩ (A × {2}). Since this holds true for our example, it supports the claim that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection."
