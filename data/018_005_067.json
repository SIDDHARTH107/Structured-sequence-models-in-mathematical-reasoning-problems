    "message_2": "To show that $A \\cap A^c = \\varnothing$, we need to show that there are no elements in common between $A$ and its complement $A^c$.\n\nFirst, let's find the complement of $A$ in $U$. The complement of $A$ in $U$, denoted as $A^c$, consists of all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$. So, $A^c = \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of $A$ and $A^c$. The intersection of two sets consists of all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no elements in common between $A$ and $A^c$. \n\nTherefore, $A \\cap A^c = \\varnothing$."
