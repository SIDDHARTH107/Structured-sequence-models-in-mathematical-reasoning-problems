Each participant is given a bag of candies with only one flavor. The company records the number of candies each participant eats before stopping. The table below shows the results:\n\n| Flavor | Number of Candies Eaten |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| A      | 8, 6, 7, 5, 3          |\n| B      | 4, 7, 6, 8, 9          |\n| C      | 2, 4, 6, 4, 5          |\n| D      | 7, 8, 6, 5, 7          |\n\nWhat is the mean number of candies eaten for each flavor and which flavor is the most popular based on the experiment?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean number of candies eaten for each flavor, we need to add the number of candies eaten for each flavor and then divide by the number of participants who tried that flavor (which is 5 for all flavors).\n\nFlavor A:\nMean = (8 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 3) / 5 = 29 / 5 = 5.8\n\nFlavor B:\nMean = (4 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 9) / 5 = 34 / 5 = 6.8\n\nFlavor C:\nMean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 21 / 5 = 4.2\n\nFlavor D:\nMean = (7 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 7) / 5 = 33 / 5 = 6.6\n\nBased on the mean number of candies eaten, Flavor B is the most popular with a mean of 6.8 candies eaten."
