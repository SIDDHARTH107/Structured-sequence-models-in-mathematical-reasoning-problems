    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the vector space $L(2P)$ of quadratic forms vanishing at $P$, we first need to find the tangent line to the curve at point $P$. \n\nThe partial derivatives of the equation $X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 = 0$ are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} = 3X^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Y} = 3Y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z} = 3Z^2$\n\nEvaluating these partial derivatives at the point $P = [0:1:-1]$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Y} = 3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z} = 3$\n\nThus, the tangent line to the curve at point $P$ is given by the equation $Y + Z = 0$.\n\nNow, we need to find the quadratic forms vanishing at $P$. A general quadratic form can be written as:\n\n$Q(X, Y, Z) = aX^2 + bY^2 + cZ^2 + dXY + eXZ + fYZ$\n\nSince $Q$ vanishes at $P = [0:1:-1]$, we can substitute the coordinates of $P$ into the equation:\n\n$Q(0, 1, -1) = b - c - f = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the quadratic forms that are tangent to the curve at point $P$. To do this, we can use the tangent line equation $Y + Z = 0$. Substituting this into the quadratic form, we get:\n\n$Q(X, -Z, Z) = aX^2 + bZ^2 + cZ^2 - dXZ + eXZ - fZ^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$Q(X, -Z, Z) = aX^2 + (b + c - f)Z^2$\n\nSince the quadratic form is tangent to the curve at point $P$, the coefficients of $X^2$ and $Z^2$ must be equal:\n\n$a = b + c - f$\n\nNow, we have two linear equations in the coefficients of the quadratic form:\n\n1. $b - c - f = 0$\n2. $a = b + c - f$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the dimension of the vector space $L(2P)$. The general solution is given by:\n\n$a = b + c$\n\n$f = c$\n\nThis gives us two free parameters, $b$ and $c$. Therefore, the dimension of the vector space $L(2P)$ of quadratic forms vanishing at $P$ is 2."
