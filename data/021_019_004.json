    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is a population-based algorithm that mimics the behavior of musicians in searching for a better state of harmony. In this case, we will use the HS algorithm to find the minimum value of the given objective function f(x) subject to the given constraints.\n\nHere are the steps to apply the Harmony Search algorithm to this problem:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solutions in the harmony memory (e.g., 10)\n   - Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of choosing a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.8)\n   - Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting a value in the harmony memory (e.g., 0.3)\n   - Number of iterations (NI): The number of times the algorithm will be executed (e.g., 1000)\n\n2. Generate an initial harmony memory (HM) with random solutions that satisfy the constraints.\n\n3. For each iteration, do the following:\n   a. Create a new harmony vector (solution) by selecting each decision variable (x1, x2, x3) as follows:\n      - With probability HMCR, choose a value from the harmony memory for the decision variable.\n      - With probability (1 - HMCR), choose a random value for the decision variable within its bounds.\n      - With probability PAR, adjust the chosen value by adding or subtracting a small random amount (e.g., a random value between -0.1 and 0.1).\n   b. Check if the new harmony vector satisfies the constraints. If not, repeat step 3a until a feasible solution is found.\n   c. Evaluate the objective function value of the new harmony vector.\n   d. If the new harmony vector has a better objective function value than the worst solution in the harmony memory, replace the worst solution with the new harmony vector.\n\n4. After NI iterations, the best solution in the harmony memory is the optimal solution.\n\nPlease note that the Harmony Search algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution found may not be the global optimum. The quality of the solution depends on the parameter settings and the number of iterations. You can adjust these parameters and run the algorithm multiple times to improve the solution."
