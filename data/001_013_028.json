    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x+5) - √(4x-1) = 1, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate one of the square roots.\nAdd √(4x-1) to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(2x+5) = √(4x-1) + 1\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.\n(√(2x+5))^2 = (√(4x-1) + 1)^2\n\n(2x+5) = (4x-1 + 2√(4x-1) + 1)\n\nStep 3: Simplify and isolate the remaining square root.\nSubtract 2x and 6 from both sides:\n\n-1 = 2x - 2√(4x-1)\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n-1/2 = x - √(4x-1)\n\nStep 4: Square both sides again to eliminate the remaining square root.\n(-1/2)^2 = (x - √(4x-1))^2\n\n1/4 = x^2 - 2x√(4x-1) + (4x-1)\n\nStep 5: Rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation.\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 1/4\n\nStep 6: Solve the quadratic equation.\nWe can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 1/4:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(1/4))) / 2(1)\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 1)) / 2\nx = (4 ± √15) / 2\n\nSo, there are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (4 + √15) / 2\nx = (4 - √15) / 2\n\nHowever, we need to check if both solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation:\n\nFor x = (4 + √15) / 2:\n\n√(2((4 + √15) / 2) + 5) - √(4((4 + √15) / 2) - 1) ≠ 1\n\nThis solution is not valid.\n\nFor x = (4 - √15) / 2:\n\n√(2((4 - √15) / 2) + 5) - √(4((4 - √15) / 2) - 1) = 1\n\nThis solution is valid.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation √(2x+5) - √(4x-1) = 1 is x = (4 - √15) / 2."
