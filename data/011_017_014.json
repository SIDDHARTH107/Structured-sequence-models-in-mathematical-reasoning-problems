    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n × n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 6x6 Latin square with numbers 1-6.\n\nTo count the number of 6x6 Latin squares, we can use the following method:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 6! (6 factorial) ways, as there are no restrictions.\n2. The second row has 5! ways to be filled, as there is only one restriction: it cannot have the same number as the first row in the same column.\n3. The third row has 4! ways to be filled, as there are two restrictions from the first two rows.\n4. The fourth row has 3! ways to be filled, as there are three restrictions from the first three rows.\n5. The fifth row has 2! ways to be filled, as there are four restrictions from the first four rows.\n6. The sixth row has only 1 way to be filled, as there are five restrictions from the first five rows.\n\nSo, the total number of 6x6 Latin squares is:\n\n6! × 5! × 4! × 3! × 2! × 1! = 720 × 120 × 24 × 6 × 2 × 1 = 1,476,992,000\n\nThere are 1,476,992,000 ways to arrange the numbers 1-6 in a 6x6 Latin square such that no number is repeated in the same row or column."
