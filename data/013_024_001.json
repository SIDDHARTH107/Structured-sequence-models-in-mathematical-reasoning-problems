    "message_1": "Suppose there are 6 volunteers who have been assigned to raise funds for their local community center. Each volunteer can either donate $10 or $20 to the center. The total amount of the fundraising must be at least $100. If at least 4 volunteers donate $20, then the fundraising goal will be reached. If less than 4 donate $20, then the fundraising goal will not be reached and the volunteers will have to continue fundraising. What is the best strategy for each volunteer to maximize the chance of reaching the fundraising goal, and what is the expected outcome of the fundraising campaign?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the chance of reaching the fundraising goal, the best strategy for each volunteer is to donate $20. This is because if at least 4 volunteers donate $20, the fundraising goal will be reached. \n\nNow let's calculate the probability of reaching the fundraising goal using this strategy. There are two possible outcomes for each volunteer: donating $10 or $20. Since there are 6 volunteers, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of donations. However, we are only interested in the combinations where at least 4 volunteers donate $20.\n\nLet's break it down by cases:\n\n1. Exactly 4 volunteers donate $20: There are C(6,4) = 15 ways to choose 4 volunteers out of 6 to donate $20. In this case, the total amount raised would be 4 * $20 + 2 * $10 = $100.\n\n2. Exactly 5 volunteers donate $20: There are C(6,5) = 6 ways to choose 5 volunteers out of 6 to donate $20. In this case, the total amount raised would be 5 * $20 + 1 * $10 = $110.\n\n3. All 6 volunteers donate $20: There is only 1 way for this to happen. In this case, the total amount raised would be 6 * $20 = $120.\n\nSo, there are a total of 15 + 6 + 1 = 22 successful combinations out of 64 possible combinations. Therefore, the probability of reaching the fundraising goal using this strategy is 22/64 = 11/32 ≈ 34.38%.\n\nThe expected outcome of the fundraising campaign can be calculated as follows:\n\nE = P(4 volunteers donate $20) * $100 + P(5 volunteers donate $20) * $110 + P(6 volunteers donate $20) * $120\nE = (15/64) * $100 + (6/64) * $110 + (1/64) * $120\nE = $1500/64 + $660/64 + $120/64\nE = $2280/64\nE ≈ $35.63\n\nSo, the expected outcome of the fundraising campaign is approximately $35.63 per volunteer."
