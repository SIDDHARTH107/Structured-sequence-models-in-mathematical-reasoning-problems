    "message_1": "Suppose we have a set of 10 data points {3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20, 25}. We want to estimate the population mean of this data set using bootstrapping. Generate 10,000 bootstrap samples with replacement and calculate the mean for each sample. Estimate the population mean and its 95% confidence interval based on the bootstrap samples.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the population mean and its 95% confidence interval using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate 10,000 bootstrap samples with replacement from the original data set.\n2. Calculate the mean for each bootstrap sample.\n3. Find the average of all the bootstrap means to estimate the population mean.\n4. Calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap means to find the 95% confidence interval.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Generate 10,000 bootstrap samples:\n\nWe will use a random number generator to create 10,000 bootstrap samples with replacement from the original data set. Each sample will have the same number of data points as the original data set (10 points).\n\n2. Calculate the mean for each bootstrap sample:\n\nFor each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples, we will calculate the mean. This will give us 10,000 bootstrap means.\n\n3. Estimate the population mean:\n\nTo estimate the population mean, we will find the average of all the 10,000 bootstrap means.\n\n4. Calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nTo find the 95% confidence interval, we will calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the 10,000 bootstrap means. This will give us the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we will have an estimated population mean and its 95% confidence interval based on the bootstrap samples. Note that the actual calculations would require a computer program or software to generate the 10,000 bootstrap samples and perform the calculations."
