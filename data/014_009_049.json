    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher structure with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. The number of rounds required for the cipher is 16. What is the total number of key bits required for this Feistel cipher structure?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, each round uses a subkey derived from the main key. Since there are 16 rounds, we need 16 subkeys. Assuming each subkey has the same size as the block size, which is 64 bits, the total number of key bits required for this Feistel cipher structure would be:\n\n16 rounds * 64 bits per round = 1024 bits"
