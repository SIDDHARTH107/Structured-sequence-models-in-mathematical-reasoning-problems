The used textbook is in good condition, but the new textbook comes with a one-year warranty. If the student estimates that the probability of needing the warranty is 0.20, which option should they choose based on decision theory?",
    "message_2": "To make a decision based on decision theory, we need to calculate the expected value of each option and choose the one with the lowest expected cost.\n\nOption 1: Buying the used textbook\nThe cost of the used textbook is $25, and there is no warranty. So, the expected cost of this option is $25.\n\nOption 2: Buying the new textbook\nThe cost of the new textbook is $40. If the student needs the warranty, they won't have to pay any additional cost. If they don't need the warranty, they still have to pay $40 for the new textbook. The probability of needing the warranty is 0.20, and the probability of not needing the warranty is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.\n\nExpected cost of the new textbook = (probability of needing the warranty * cost if needed) + (probability of not needing the warranty * cost if not needed)\n= (0.20 * $0) + (0.80 * $40)\n= $0 + $32\n= $32\n\nComparing the expected costs:\nUsed textbook: $25\nNew textbook: $32\n\nBased on decision theory, the student should choose the used textbook, as it has a lower expected cost ($25) compared to the new textbook ($32)."
