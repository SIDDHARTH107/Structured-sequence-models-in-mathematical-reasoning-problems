    "message_2": "The first three Sophie Germain primes are 2, 3, and 5. These are prime numbers where if you double the number and add 1, the result is also a prime number. For example:\n\n2 is a prime number, and 2(2) + 1 = 5, which is also prime.\n3 is a prime number, and 2(3) + 1 = 7, which is also prime.\n5 is a prime number, and 2(5) + 1 = 11, which is also prime."
