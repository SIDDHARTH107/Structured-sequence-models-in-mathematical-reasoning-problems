    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface z = sin(3x) + 2cos(y), we will use the geodesic equations derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations. Let's first find the metric tensor components g_ij for the given surface.\n\nThe parametric representation of the surface is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, sin(3u) + 2cos(v))\n\nwhere x = u, y = v, and z = sin(3u) + 2cos(v).\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 3cos(3u))\nr_v = (0, 1, -2sin(v))\n\nNext, we find the metric tensor components:\n\ng_11 = r_u • r_u = 1 + 9cos^2(3u)\ng_12 = g_21 = r_u • r_v = 0\ng_22 = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4sin^2(v)\n\nNow, we can write down the Euler-Lagrange equations for geodesics:\n\nd^2u/dt^2 - Γ^1_ij * (du/dt)(dv/dt) = 0\nd^2v/dt^2 - Γ^2_ij * (du/dt)(dv/dt) = 0\n\nwhere Γ^k_ij are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, given by:\n\nΓ^k_ij = (1/2) * g^(kl) * (∂g_li/∂x^j + ∂g_lj/∂x^i - ∂g_ij/∂x^l)\n\nComputing the Christoffel symbols:\n\nΓ^1_11 = (1/2) * (1/(1 + 9cos^2(3u))) * (-18cos(3u)sin(3u))\nΓ^1_12 = Γ^1_21 = 0\nΓ^1_22 = 0\n\nΓ^2_11 = 0\nΓ^2_12 = Γ^2_21 = 0\nΓ^2_22 = (1/2) * (1/(1 + 4sin^2(v))) * (-8sin(v)cos(v))\n\nNow, we can write down the Euler-Lagrange equations for geodesics:\n\nd^2u/dt^2 - (-18cos(3u)sin(3u)) * (du/dt)^2 = 0\nd^2v/dt^2 - (-8sin(v)cos(v)) * (dv/dt)^2 = 0\n\nThese are two coupled nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved numerically for u(t) and v(t), given the initial conditions u(0) = 0, v(0) = 0, du/dt(0) = 1, and dv/dt(0) = 1.\n\nOnce we have the solutions u(t) and v(t), we can find the geodesic on the surface by plugging them back into the parametric representation:\n\nr(u(t), v(t)) = (u(t), v(t), sin(3u(t)) + 2cos(v(t)))\n\nThis will give us the equation of the geodesics on the surface z = sin(3x) + 2cos(y) starting at the point (0, 0, 1) and having the initial direction vector (1, 1, 1)."
