    "message_2": "Let's denote the isosceles triangle as ABC, where AB = AC = 8 cm (the equal sides) and angle BAC = 50 degrees. We want to find the length of side BC.\n\nTo find the length of side BC, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = b = 8 cm, and angle C = 50 degrees. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\nBC^2 = 8^2 + 8^2 - 2 * 8 * 8 * cos(50)\nBC^2 = 64 + 64 - 128 * cos(50)\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of 50 degrees:\n\ncos(50) ≈ 0.6428\n\nPlug this value back into the equation:\n\nBC^2 = 64 + 64 - 128 * 0.6428\nBC^2 ≈ 128 - 82.2784\nBC^2 ≈ 45.7216\n\nNow, we can find the length of side BC by taking the square root of BC^2:\n\nBC ≈ √45.7216\nBC ≈ 6.76 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side (BC) is approximately 6.76 cm."
