    "message_1": "Consider the algebraic curve given by the equation: $y^2=x^3-x^2$.\nFind the singular points of this curve and determine their type as either node, cusp or ordinary double point.",
    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve, we first compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2 - x^3 + x^2) = -3x^2 + 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2 - x^3 + x^2) = 2y$\n\nA singular point occurs when both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$-3x^2 + 2x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now, we can substitute this into the first equation:\n\n$-3x^2 + 2x = 0$\n\n$x(-3x + 2) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac{2}{3}$. Now, we can find the corresponding points on the curve:\n\nFor $x = 0$, we have $y^2 = 0^3 - 0^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$. The point is $(0, 0)$.\n\nFor $x = \\frac{2}{3}$, we have $y^2 = (\\frac{2}{3})^3 - (\\frac{2}{3})^2 = \\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{4}{9} = -\\frac{4}{27}$, but since $y^2$ must be non-negative, there is no corresponding point on the curve for this value of x.\n\nSo, the only singular point is $(0, 0)$. Now, we need to determine the type of this singular point. We compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(y^2 - x^3 + x^2) = -6x + 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y}(y^2 - x^3 + x^2) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}(y^2 - x^3 + x^2) = 2$\n\nNow, we compute the discriminant, $\\Delta$, at the singular point $(0, 0)$:\n\n$\\Delta = (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} - (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y})^2)(0, 0) = (2 \\cdot 2 - 0^2) = 4$\n\nSince $\\Delta > 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(0, 0) = 2 > 0$, the singular point $(0, 0)$ is a node."
