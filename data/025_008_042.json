Assume that $X$ is a compact Kähler manifold with a Kähler metric $g$. Let $\\omega_{k}$ be the natural Kähler form on $X$ and let $\\alpha \\in H^{1}(X,\\mathbb{R})$ be a real cohomology class. \n\nFind a compact Kähler manifold $X$ of dimension $n$ and a Kähler metric $g$ on $X$ such that $\\omega_{k}$ is isotopic to a multiple of $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\alpha^{n-1} \\neq 0$.",
    "message_2": "Consider the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ as our compact Kähler manifold $X$. The complex projective space is a Kähler manifold with the Fubini-Study metric $g$, and its Kähler form is given by $\\omega_{FS}$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is $n$.\n\nNow, let $\\omega_{k} = k\\omega_{FS}$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Since $\\omega_{k}$ is a multiple of the Kähler form $\\omega_{FS}$, it is also a Kähler form on $\\mathbb{CP}^n$. Therefore, $\\omega_{k}$ is isotopic to a multiple of $\\omega_{1}$, which is the Kähler form of $\\mathbb{CP}^1$.\n\nNext, let $\\alpha \\in H^1(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{R})$. Since the first cohomology group of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is trivial, i.e., $H^1(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, we have $\\alpha = 0$. However, we need to find an $\\alpha$ such that $\\alpha^{n-1} \\neq 0$. To achieve this, we consider the cohomology class $\\alpha \\in H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{R})$ represented by the Kähler form $\\omega_{FS}$. Note that $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{R})$ is generated by the cohomology class of $\\omega_{FS}$.\n\nNow, we compute the $(n-1)$-th power of $\\alpha$ in the cohomology ring. Since $\\alpha$ is represented by $\\omega_{FS}$, we have $\\alpha^{n-1} = [\\omega_{FS}]^{n-1}$. The cohomology ring of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is given by $\\mathbb{R}[\\alpha]/(\\alpha^{n+1})$, so $\\alpha^{n-1} \\neq 0$ in the cohomology ring.\n\nIn summary, we have found a compact Kähler manifold $X = \\mathbb{CP}^n$ with a Kähler metric $g$ (the Fubini-Study metric) such that $\\omega_{k}$ is isotopic to a multiple of $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\alpha^{n-1} \\neq 0$."
