    "message_2": "First, let's check if the group G is abelian by examining the multiplication table. If the table is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, then the group is abelian.\n\nComparing the elements in the table, we can see that it is not symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. For example, the element at the intersection of row a and column b is c, while the element at the intersection of row b and column a is f. Since the group is not abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C16, which is abelian.\n\nNow let's check if the group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8. The dihedral group D8 has 8 elements and is non-abelian, so it could potentially be isomorphic to G. However, the dihedral group D8 has a specific structure: it consists of rotations and reflections of a regular octagon. The dihedral group has a subgroup of order 4 (the rotations) and all other elements have order 2 (the reflections). \n\nLooking at the multiplication table of G, we can see that there are elements with order 4 (for example, a * a = e, a * b = c, and a * c = b). Since the dihedral group D8 does not have elements of order 4, G cannot be isomorphic to D8.\n\nFinally, let's consider the non-abelian group of order 16. Since G is a non-abelian group with 8 elements, it cannot be isomorphic to a group of order 16.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G is not isomorphic to any of the given groups: the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16."
