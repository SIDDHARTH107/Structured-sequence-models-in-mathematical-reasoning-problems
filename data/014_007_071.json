    "message_1": "A stream cipher uses a random key stream generated by a linear congruential generator with a modulus of 256. The multiplier is 17, the increment is 93, and the initial value is 11. If the first 5 values generated by this key stream are 24, 169, 62, 85, and 124, what is the 6th value in the key stream?",
    "message_2": "To find the 6th value in the key stream, we can use the linear congruential generator formula:\n\nXn+1 = (a * Xn + c) mod m\n\nwhere Xn is the nth value in the key stream, a is the multiplier, c is the increment, and m is the modulus.\n\nGiven that the 5th value (X5) is 124, we can find the 6th value (X6) using the formula:\n\nX6 = (17 * 124 + 93) mod 256\nX6 = (2108 + 93) mod 256\nX6 = 2201 mod 256\nX6 = 105\n\nSo, the 6th value in the key stream is 105."
