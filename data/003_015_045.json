    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 4sin(3x + π/4), we need to analyze the function and identify its key features.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 4. Therefore, the amplitude of the function is |4| = 4.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The period of a basic sine function is 2π, so to find the period of this function, we divide the basic period by the coefficient of the x term:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 4sin(3x + π/4) is 4, and the period is (2π) / 3."
