    "message_1": "Suppose we have a message \"MATHEMATICS\" and we apply a transposition cipher by rearranging its letters into every third letter, followed by every fourth letter, followed by every fifth letter and so on until every tenth letter. What is the resulting ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "To apply the transposition cipher, we first need to rearrange the letters of the message \"MATHEMATICS\" according to the given pattern. Let's start with every third letter:\n\nM _ T _ E _ A _ I _ S\n\nNow, let's fill in every fourth letter:\n\nM _ T H _ E M _ A I _ S\n\nNext, every fifth letter:\n\nM A T H E M A T I C S\n\nSince the message has only 11 letters, we don't need to continue with every sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth letters.\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext after applying the transposition cipher is \"MATHEMATICS\"."
