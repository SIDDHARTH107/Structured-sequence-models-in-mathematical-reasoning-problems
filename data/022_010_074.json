    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - 2) centered at z = 2, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z - 2):\n\nf(z) = ((z - 2 + 2)^2 - 1)/(z - 2)\n     = (((z - 2)^2 + 4(z - 2) + 4) - 1)/(z - 2)\n\nNow, we can separate the function into two parts:\n\nf(z) = (z - 2)^2/(z - 2) + 4(z - 2)/(z - 2) + 3/(z - 2)\n\nSimplifying each part:\n\nf(z) = (z - 2) + 4 + 3/(z - 2)\n\nNow, we can write the Laurent series expansion for each part:\n\n1. (z - 2) is already a Laurent series centered at z = 2.\n2. 4 is a constant term, so it's also a Laurent series centered at z = 2.\n3. For the last term, 3/(z - 2), we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n3/(z - 2) = 3 * 1/(1 - (-(z - 2)))\n\nSince |-(z - 2)| < 1 in the annulus 1 < |z - 2| < 3, the geometric series converges, and we can write the Laurent series expansion as:\n\n3/(z - 2) = 3 * Σ((-1)^n * (z - 2)^n) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we can combine all three parts to get the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = (z - 2) + 4 + Σ((-1)^n * (z - 2)^n) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nThe convergence of this Laurent series is determined by the convergence of the geometric series, which converges in the annulus 1 < |z - 2| < 3."
