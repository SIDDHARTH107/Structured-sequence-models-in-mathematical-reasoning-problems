    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the method of least squares, we first need to rewrite the system in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants. In this case, we have:\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 3 -1  4 |\n    | 2  1  1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 5.3 |\n    | 4.2 |\n    | 8.1 |\n\nNow, we will use the method of least squares to find the best approximation for X. The least squares solution is given by:\n\nX = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * B\n\nwhere A^T is the transpose of A and (A^T * A)^(-1) is the inverse of the product of A^T and A. Let's compute these matrices:\n\nA^T = | 1  3  2 |\n      | 2 -1  1 |\n      |-1  4  1 |\n\nA^T * A = | 14  0  6 |\n          |  0  6  0 |\n          |  6  0 18 |\n\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = | 1/14   0 -1/21 |\n                 |   0  1/6    0  |\n                 |-1/21   0  1/18 |\n\nA^T * B = | 37.1 |\n          |-2.7  |\n          |  6.3 |\n\nNow, we can compute the least squares solution X:\n\nX = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * B = | 1/14   0 -1/21 | * | 37.1 |\n                                |   0  1/6    0  |   |-2.7  |\n                                |-1/21   0  1/18 |   |  6.3 |\n\nX = | 2.65 |\n    | 0.45 |\n    | 0.35 |\n\nSo, the least squares solution for the given system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx = 2.65\ny = 0.45\nz = 0.35"
