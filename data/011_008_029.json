    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this problem, we have n = 5 gifts and k = 3 children.\n\nWe can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind formula to solve this problem:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nFirst, we need to find the values for S(4, 2), S(4, 3), and S(3, 2) to calculate S(5, 3).\n\n1. S(4, 2):\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\nTo find S(3, 2) and S(3, 1), we need to calculate the following:\nS(3, 2) = 2 * S(2, 2) + S(2, 1) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3\nS(3, 1) = 1 * S(2, 1) + S(2, 0) = 1 * 1 + 0 = 1\n\nNow, we can find S(4, 2):\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\n\n2. S(4, 3):\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(3, 3) = 3 * S(2, 3) + S(2, 2) = 3 * 0 + 1 = 1\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\n\n3. S(3, 2):\nWe have already calculated this value: S(3, 2) = 3\n\nNow, we can find S(5, 3):\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25\n\nSo, there are 25 ways to distribute the 5 identical gifts among the 3 different children, with each child receiving at least 1 gift."
