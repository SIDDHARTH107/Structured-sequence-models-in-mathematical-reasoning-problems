    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) + cos(x) = 1 in the interval [0, 2π], we can use the double angle identity for sine, which is sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) + cos(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term cos(x):\n\ncos(x)(2sin(x) + 1) = 1\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: cos(x) = 0\nx = π/2, 3π/2\n\nCase 2: 2sin(x) + 1 = 0\nsin(x) = -1/2\nx = 7π/6, 11π/6\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = π/2, 3π/2, 7π/6, 11π/6"
