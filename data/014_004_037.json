    "message_2": "To find the order of the point Q, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that nQ = O, where O is the point at infinity (the identity element in the elliptic curve group).\n\nWe can do this by computing multiples of Q until we reach the point at infinity. We'll use the point addition and point doubling formulas for elliptic curves.\n\nThe curve equation is y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 (mod 23).\n\nLet's compute the multiples of Q:\n\n1Q = Q = (16, 5)\n\n2Q:\nSince we're doubling the point, we use the point doubling formula:\nλ = (3x^2 + a) / 2y (mod p)\nλ = (3 * 16^2 + 5) / (2 * 5) (mod 23)\nλ = (3 * 9 + 5) / 10 (mod 23)\nλ = 32 / 10 (mod 23)\nλ = 9\n\nNow, we can find the new x and y coordinates:\nx_new = λ^2 - 2x (mod p)\nx_new = 9^2 - 2 * 16 (mod 23)\nx_new = 81 - 32 (mod 23)\nx_new = 49 (mod 23)\nx_new = 3\n\ny_new = λ(x - x_new) - y (mod p)\ny_new = 9(16 - 3) - 5 (mod 23)\ny_new = 9 * 13 - 5 (mod 23)\ny_new = 117 - 5 (mod 23)\ny_new = 112 (mod 23)\ny_new = 1\n\nSo, 2Q = (3, 1).\n\n3Q = Q + 2Q:\nSince we're adding two different points, we use the point addition formula:\nλ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) (mod p)\nλ = (1 - 5) / (3 - 16) (mod 23)\nλ = (-4) / (-13) (mod 23)\nλ = 4 * 13^(-1) (mod 23)\nλ = 4 * 9 (mod 23)\nλ = 36 (mod 23)\nλ = 13\n\nNow, we can find the new x and y coordinates:\nx_new = λ^2 - x1 - x2 (mod p)\nx_new = 13^2 - 16 - 3 (mod 23)\nx_new = 169 - 19 (mod 23)\nx_new = 150 (mod 23)\nx_new = 4\n\ny_new = λ(x1 - x_new) - y1 (mod p)\ny_new = 13(16 - 4) - 5 (mod 23)\ny_new = 13 * 12 - 5 (mod 23)\ny_new = 156 - 5 (mod 23)\ny_new = 151 (mod 23)\ny_new = 12\n\nSo, 3Q = (4, 12).\n\n4Q = 2Q + 2Q:\nSince we're adding two different points, we use the point addition formula:\nλ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) (mod p)\nλ = (1 - 1) / (3 - 3) (mod 23)\nSince the denominator is 0, we've reached the point at infinity.\n\nThus, the order of the point Q is 4."
