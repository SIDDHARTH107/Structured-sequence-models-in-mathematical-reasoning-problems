We will find the powers of 2 and 3 modulo 19 until we find the desired congruences.\n\nPowers of 2 modulo 19:\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 19)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 19)\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 19)\n2^4 ≡ 16 (mod 19)\n2^5 ≡ 13 (mod 19)\n2^6 ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n2^7 ≡ 14 (mod 19)\n2^8 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n2^9 ≡ 18 (mod 19)\n2^10 ≡ 17 (mod 19)\n2^11 ≡ 15 (mod 19)\n2^12 ≡ 11 (mod 19)\n2^13 ≡ 3 (mod 19)\n2^14 ≡ 6 (mod 19)\n2^15 ≡ 12 (mod 19)\n2^16 ≡ 5 (mod 19)\n\nSo, 2^16 ≡ 5 (mod 19).\n\nPowers of 3 modulo 19:\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 19)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n3^3 ≡ 8 (mod 19)\n3^4 ≡ 5 (mod 19)\n3^5 ≡ 15 (mod 19)\n3^6 ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n3^7 ≡ 2 (mod 19)\n3^8 ≡ 6 (mod 19)\n3^9 ≡ 18 (mod 19)\n3^10 ≡ 16 (mod 19)\n3^11 ≡ 10 (mod 19)\n3^12 ≡ 11 (mod 19)\n3^13 ≡ 14 (mod 19)\n3^14 ≡ 4 (mod 19)\n3^15 ≡ 12 (mod 19)\n3^16 ≡ 17 (mod 19)\n3^17 ≡ 13 (mod 19)\n3^18 ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n3^19 ≡ 3 (mod 19)\n3^20 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n3^21 ≡ 8 (mod 19)\n3^22 ≡ 5 (mod 19)\n3^23 ≡ 15 (mod 19)\n3^24 ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n\nSo, 3^24 ≡ 7 (mod 19).\n\nNow we have found that x = 16 satisfies the first congruence and x = 24 satisfies the second congruence. Since 16 and 24 share no common factors other than 1, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies both congruences is the least common multiple of 16 and 24, which is 48.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies both congruences is x = 48."
