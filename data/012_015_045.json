    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected, we need to check if there is a path between every pair of vertices in the graph.\n\nA graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges. In this case, we have 8 vertices, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is (8-1) = 7 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 10 edges, which is more than the minimum required, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as the extra edges could form loops or multiple edges between the same vertices.\n\nTo definitively determine if the graph is connected, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges."
