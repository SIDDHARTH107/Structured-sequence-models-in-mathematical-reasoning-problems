    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 3$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, we need to perform a series of transformations to remove any rational 2-torsion and 3-torsion points. We will use the standard notation $E: y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ for an elliptic curve.\n\nFirst, let's check for 2-torsion points. These are points where $y = 0$. In our case, we have:\n\n$0 = x^3 - 3x + 3 \\Rightarrow x^3 - 3x + 3 = 0$\n\nThis cubic equation has no rational roots, so there are no rational 2-torsion points. Thus, we don't need to perform any transformations for 2-torsion.\n\nNext, let's check for 3-torsion points. These are points where the curve has a point of order 3. To do this, we will look at the discriminant of the curve, which is given by:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$\n\nFor our curve, $A = -3$ and $B = 3$, so the discriminant is:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4(-3)^3 + 27(3)^2) = -16(-108) = 1728$\n\nSince the discriminant is non-zero, the curve is non-singular. The j-invariant of the curve is given by:\n\n$j(E) = 1728 \\cdot \\frac{4A^3}{\\Delta} = 1728 \\cdot \\frac{4(-3)^3}{1728} = -27$\n\nThe curve has a rational 3-torsion point if and only if the j-invariant is an integer. In this case, the j-invariant is -27, which is an integer, so the curve has a rational 3-torsion point.\n\nTo remove the 3-torsion, we will perform a change of variables. Let $x' = x$ and $y' = y - (x^3 - 3x)/3$. Then the new equation becomes:\n\n$y'^2 = x'^3 - 3x' + 3 - (x'^3 - 3x')/3 - (x'^3 - 3x')^2/9$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$y'^2 = x'^3 - 3x'^2 + 3x' = x'(x'^2 - 3x' + 3)$\n\nNow the curve is in the form $y'^2 = x'(x'^2 + Ax' + B)$, which is a minimal model since there are no rational 2-torsion or 3-torsion points. Thus, the minimal model of the elliptic curve is:\n\n$y^2 = x(x^2 - 3x + 3)$"
