    "message_1": "A farmer has 100 acres of land to plant two types of crops: wheat and barley. The profit per acre for wheat is $200, and for barley, it is $300. However, the farmer has only 60 tons of fertilizer and 80 tons of herbicides. Wheat requires 1 ton of fertilizer and 2 tons of herbicides per acre, while barley requires 2 tons of fertilizer and 1 ton of herbicides per acre. What is the optimal allocation of land to wheat and barley that will maximize the farmer's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of barley. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 200x + 300y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 100 (total acres constraint)\n2. x + 2y ≤ 60 (fertilizer constraint)\n3. 2x + y ≤ 80 (herbicides constraint)\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 100 => y = 100 - x\n2. x + 2y = 60 => y = (60 - x) / 2\n3. 2x + y = 80 => y = 80 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of these lines:\n\nA: (0, 0) - Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0\nB: (0, 30) - Intersection of x = 0 and y = (60 - x) / 2\nC: (20, 20) - Intersection of y = (60 - x) / 2 and y = 80 - 2x\nD: (40, 0) - Intersection of y = 0 and y = 80 - 2x\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\nP(A) = 200(0) + 300(0) = $0\nP(B) = 200(0) + 300(30) = $9,000\nP(C) = 200(20) + 300(20) = $10,000\nP(D) = 200(40) + 300(0) = $8,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, with 20 acres of wheat and 20 acres of barley. The farmer should allocate 20 acres to wheat and 20 acres to barley to maximize their profit, which will be $10,000."
