    "message_2": "To draw the graph with the given degree sequence, we can label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F. We know that vertices A, B, and C have a degree of 2, while vertices D, E, and F have a degree of 1.\n\nWe can start by connecting vertices A, B, and C to form a cycle, as follows:\n\nA -- B\n|    |\nC -- D\n\nNow, we need to connect vertices D, E, and F, each with a degree of 1. We can connect D to A, E to B, and F to C:\n\nA -- B\n|    |\nC -- D\n|    |\nF -- E\n\nNow, we have a graph with the given degree sequence. The edges in the graph are:\n\n1. A - B\n2. A - D\n3. B - C\n4. B - E\n5. C - F\n6. D - C\n\nThere is only one possible graph with the given degree sequence, and these are all the possible edges between the vertices."
