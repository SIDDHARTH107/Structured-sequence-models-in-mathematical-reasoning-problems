    "message_1": "A butterfly flaps its wings in New York City, causing a small disturbance in the air. According to chaos theory, this disturbance could potentially escalate into a much larger event. If the initial disturbance caused the atmospheric pressure to increase by 0.000002 kPa, and the resulting effect of this disturbance causes a tornado in Texas with an atmospheric pressure drop of 20 kPa, what is the ratio of the magnitudes of these atmospheric pressure changes? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the ratio of the magnitudes of these atmospheric pressure changes, we will divide the larger pressure change (the tornado in Texas) by the smaller pressure change (the butterfly flapping its wings in New York City).\n\nRatio = (Magnitude of Tornado Pressure Change) / (Magnitude of Butterfly Pressure Change)\n\nRatio = 20 kPa / 0.000002 kPa\n\nRatio = 10,000,000\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the ratio is 10,000,000.00."
