    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using graph theory. In this case, we are looking for a graph where every vertex (person) has a degree of at least 3 (knows at least 3 other attendees), and there is no complete subgraph of 4 vertices (no group of 4 people are all friends with each other).\n\nA graph that satisfies these conditions is the Moser spindle. The Moser spindle has 7 vertices and 11 edges. Each vertex has a degree of 3, and there is no complete subgraph of 4 vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can attend the party under these conditions is 7."
