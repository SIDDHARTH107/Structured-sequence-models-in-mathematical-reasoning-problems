    "message_2": "a) To find the value of N (modulus), we multiply the prime numbers p and q:\n\nN = p * q = 11 * 13 = 143\n\nTo find the value of φ (Euler's totient function), we use the formula:\n\nφ(N) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (11 - 1) * (13 - 1) = 10 * 12 = 120\n\nb) We need to choose an appropriate e (public encryption key) such that it is coprime to φ. A common choice for e is 3 or 17. In this case, we can choose e = 3 since it is coprime to 120.\n\nNow, we will encrypt the message \"HELLO\" in block form with 2 digits for each letter (A=01, B=02, ...).\n\nHELLO = 08 05 12 12 15\n\nWe will encrypt each block using the formula:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod N)\n\n08^3 (mod 143) = 83\n05^3 (mod 143) = 125\n12^3 (mod 143) = 3\n12^3 (mod 143) = 3\n15^3 (mod 143) = 96\n\nThe encrypted message is: 83 125 3 3 96\n\nc) To calculate the private decryption key d, we need to find the modular inverse of e (mod φ):\n\nd ≡ e^(-1) (mod φ)\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that d = 27.\n\nNow, we will decrypt the encrypted message using the formula:\n\nM ≡ C^d (mod N)\n\n83^27 (mod 143) = 8\n125^27 (mod 143) = 5\n3^27 (mod 143) = 12\n3^27 (mod 143) = 12\n96^27 (mod 143) = 15\n\nThe decrypted message is: 08 05 12 12 15, which corresponds to \"HELLO\"."
