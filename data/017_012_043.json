    "message_2": "We cannot determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16 without more information about the group G. However, we can provide some criteria that can help determine which group G is isomorphic to.\n\n1. If G is abelian, then it cannot be isomorphic to D8 or the non-abelian group of order 16, since both of these groups are non-abelian. In this case, we would need to check if G is cyclic.\n\n2. If G is cyclic, then it must be isomorphic to C16. A group of order 16 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 16. So, if we can find an element in G with order 16, then G is isomorphic to C16.\n\n3. If G is non-abelian, then it could be isomorphic to either D8 or the non-abelian group of order 16. To distinguish between these two cases, we can look at the structure of the group. The dihedral group D8 has 8 elements of order 2 and 8 elements of order 4. If G has a similar structure, then it is likely isomorphic to D8. On the other hand, if G has a different structure, it may be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn summary, we need more information about the group G to determine which group it is isomorphic to. By analyzing the properties of G, such as its abelian or non-abelian nature, the orders of its elements, and its overall structure, we can determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16."
