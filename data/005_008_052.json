    "message_2": "To find the forecasted value for January of the next year using a linear trend, we first need to find the slope of the trend line. We can do this by finding the average change in the data per month.\n\nThe data is as follows:\n\nMonth (t) | Value (y)\n1 (Jan)   | 80\n2 (Feb)   | 85\n3 (Mar)   | 90\n4 (Apr)   | 94\n5 (May)   | 98\n6 (Jun)   | 101\n7 (Jul)   | 105\n8 (Aug)   | 110\n9 (Sep)   | 115\n10 (Oct)  | 118\n11 (Nov)  | 122\n12 (Dec)  | 126\n\nTo find the slope (m), we can use the formula:\n\nm = (Σ(t*y) - (Σt * Σy) / n) / (Σ(t^2) - (Σt)^2 / n)\n\nwhere n is the number of data points (12 in this case), t is the month, and y is the value for that month.\n\nFirst, we calculate the necessary sums:\n\nΣt = 1 + 2 + ... + 12 = 78\nΣy = 80 + 85 + ... + 126 = 1194\nΣ(t*y) = 1*80 + 2*85 + ... + 12*126 = 9456\nΣ(t^2) = 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 12^2 = 650\n\nNow, we can plug these sums into the formula for the slope:\n\nm = (9456 - (78 * 1194) / 12) / (650 - (78)^2 / 12)\nm = (9456 - 93492 / 12) / (650 - 6084 / 12)\nm = (9456 - 7791) / (650 - 507)\nm = 1665 / 143\nm ≈ 11.64\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can find the intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = (Σy - m * Σt) / n\nb = (1194 - 11.64 * 78) / 12\nb = (1194 - 908.32) / 12\nb ≈ 23.81\n\nNow we have the linear trend equation:\n\ny = 11.64t + 23.81\n\nTo forecast the value for January of the next year (t = 13), we can plug t = 13 into the equation:\n\ny = 11.64 * 13 + 23.81\ny ≈ 151.25\n\nSo, the forecasted value for January of the next year is approximately 151.25."
