    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2.\n2. Determine the possible divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to analyze the Sylow subgroups and their possible structures.\n\nLet's analyze the Sylow subgroups:\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroups: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 9. If n_2 = 1, the unique Sylow 2-subgroup is normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and they are not normal.\n- Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 2^3 = 8, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or n_3 = 4. If n_3 = 1, the unique Sylow 3-subgroup is normal. If n_3 = 4, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and they are not normal.\n\nNow, we can list the possible non-isomorphic groups of order 72:\n\n1. A direct product of the normal Sylow subgroups: (Z_8 x Z_9) ≅ (Z_8 x Z_3 x Z_3) ≅ Z_72.\n2. A semidirect product of the normal Sylow 2-subgroup with a non-normal Sylow 3-subgroup: Z_8 ⋊ Z_9. There are two possibilities here, depending on the action of Z_9 on Z_8: Z_8 ⋊ Z_9 ≅ Z_8 ⋊ Z_3^2, which gives two non-isomorphic groups.\n3. A semidirect product of the non-normal Sylow 2-subgroup with a normal Sylow 3-subgroup: Z_2^3 ⋊ Z_9. There are four possibilities here, depending on the action of Z_9 on Z_2^3: Z_2^3 ⋊ Z_9 ≅ Z_2^3 ⋊ Z_3^2, which gives four non-isomorphic groups.\n4. A semidirect product of the non-normal Sylow 2-subgroup with a non-normal Sylow 3-subgroup: Z_2^3 ⋊ Z_3^2. There are no possibilities here since both Sylow subgroups are non-normal.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
