    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. Since there are 6 students and 3 identical candy bars, we want to find the number of ways to choose 3 students from the group of 6 to receive a candy bar.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, students), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, candy bars), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, in this problem, we have:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(6, 3) = (720) / (6 × 6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo there are 20 ways to divide the 3 identical candy bars among the 6 students such that each student gets at most one candy bar."
