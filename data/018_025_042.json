Finally, show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection, i.e., show that (A Δ B) ∩ B ≠ (B Δ A) ∩ A.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In this case, since A and B have no common elements, the symmetric difference is simply the union of both sets.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common elements between A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNow we need to show that (A Δ B) ∩ B ≠ (B Δ A) ∩ A. Since A Δ B = B Δ A, we can rewrite this as:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ B ≠ (A Δ B) ∩ A\n\nWe already found that A Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now let's find the intersection of (A Δ B) with B and A.\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n(A Δ B) ∩ A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the two sets are not equal:\n\n{1, 3, 5, 7, 9} ≠ {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nTherefore, we have shown that (A Δ B) ∩ B ≠ (B Δ A) ∩ A."
