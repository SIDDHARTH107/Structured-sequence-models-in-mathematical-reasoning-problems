    "message_2": "To find the centroid of the top-right small triangle, we first need to find the coordinates of its vertices. The original triangle has vertices A(0,0), B(3,0), and C(0,4). \n\nLet's find the midpoints of the sides of the original triangle:\n\nMidpoint of AB: M1 = ((0+3)/2, (0+0)/2) = (1.5, 0)\nMidpoint of BC: M2 = ((3+0)/2, (0+4)/2) = (1.5, 2)\nMidpoint of AC: M3 = ((0+0)/2, (0+4)/2) = (0, 2)\n\nNow, we have the vertices of the top-right small triangle: B(3,0), M1(1.5, 0), and M2(1.5, 2).\n\nTo find the centroid of this small triangle, we need to find the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of its vertices:\n\nCentroid = ((3+1.5+1.5)/3, (0+0+2)/3) = (2, 2/3)\n\nSo, the coordinates of the centroid of the top-right small triangle are (2, 2/3)."
