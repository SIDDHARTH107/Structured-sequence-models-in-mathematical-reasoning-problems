    "message_1": "Assuming that the probability of a specific type of traffic accident occurring on a certain road is 0.18, what is the probability that out of 10 randomly selected accidents on that road, at least 2 of them will be of that specific type?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 specific type of accidents occurring out of 10 randomly selected accidents, we can use the binomial probability formula. However, it's easier to find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., 0 or 1 specific type of accident occurring) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (specific type of accidents) in n trials (total accidents)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (specific type of accident)\n- n is the number of trials (total accidents)\n- k is the number of successes (specific type of accidents)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 specific type of accidents occurring:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(10, 0) * 0.18^0 * (1-0.18)^(10-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.82^10\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.026\n\nNow, let's find the probability of 1 specific type of accident occurring:\n\nP(X = 1) = C(10, 1) * 0.18^1 * (1-0.18)^(10-1)\nP(X = 1) = 10 * 0.18 * 0.82^9\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.136\n\nNow, we can find the probability of the complementary event (0 or 1 specific type of accident):\n\nP(0 or 1 specific type of accident) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) ≈ 0.026 + 0.136 = 0.162\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 2 specific type of accidents:\n\nP(at least 2 specific type of accidents) = 1 - P(0 or 1 specific type of accident) = 1 - 0.162 = 0.838\n\nSo, the probability of at least 2 specific type of accidents occurring out of 10 randomly selected accidents on that road is approximately 0.838 or 83.8%."
