    "message_2": "To compute the Riemann curvature tensor components, we first need to find the metric tensor components and their derivatives. Then, we can use the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives to compute the Riemann curvature tensor components.\n\n1. Parametrization of the surface:\nLet's parametrize the surface using the coordinates (u, v) such that x = u, y = v, and z = sin(u*v). Then, the position vector is given by:\nR(u, v) = (u, v, sin(u*v))\n\n2. Compute the tangent vectors:\nThe tangent vectors are given by the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to u and v:\nRu = dR/du = (1, 0, v*cos(u*v))\nRv = dR/dv = (0, 1, u*cos(u*v))\n\n3. Compute the metric tensor components:\nThe metric tensor components are given by the dot products of the tangent vectors:\ng11 = Ru • Ru = 1 + v^2*cos^2(u*v)\ng12 = g21 = Ru • Rv = u*v*cos^2(u*v)\ng22 = Rv • Rv = 1 + u^2*cos^2(u*v)\n\n4. Compute the Christoffel symbols:\nThe Christoffel symbols are given by:\nΓ^i_jk = 1/2 * g^il * ( ∂g_lk/∂x^j + ∂g_lj/∂x^k - ∂g_jk/∂x^l )\n\nHere, we need to compute the inverse metric tensor components (g^11, g^12, g^21, g^22) and the partial derivatives of the metric tensor components with respect to u and v.\n\n5. Compute the Riemann curvature tensor components:\nThe Riemann curvature tensor components are given by:\nR^i_jkl = ∂Γ^i_jl/∂x^k - ∂Γ^i_jk/∂x^l + Γ^i_mk * Γ^m_jl - Γ^i_ml * Γ^m_jk\n\nSince we are working in a 2-dimensional manifold, there are only two non-zero components of the Riemann curvature tensor: R^1_212 and R^2_121. The other components are either zero or related to these two components by symmetry.\n\n6. Evaluate the Riemann curvature tensor components at the point (1,1,sin(1)):\nCompute the metric tensor components, their derivatives, the Christoffel symbols, and the Riemann curvature tensor components at the point (u=1, v=1). Then, the components of the Riemann curvature tensor at the point (1,1,sin(1)) on the surface are given by:\nR^1_212 = R^1_212(1,1)\nR^2_121 = R^2_121(1,1)\n\nThe calculations for the metric tensor components, their derivatives, the Christoffel symbols, and the Riemann curvature tensor components involve lengthy algebraic expressions. It is recommended to use a symbolic computation software like Mathematica or Maple to perform these calculations."
