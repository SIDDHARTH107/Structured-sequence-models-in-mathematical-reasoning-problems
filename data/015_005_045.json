    "message_2": "To find the Lyapunov exponents of the Rössler system, we need to linearize the system and compute the exponents from the Jacobian matrix. However, calculating the Lyapunov exponents analytically is not possible for this system. Therefore, we will use a numerical method to approximate the exponents.\n\nWe will use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Define the Rössler system and its Jacobian matrix.\n2. Integrate the system using a numerical method (e.g., Runge-Kutta) for a given time.\n3. Calculate the Lyapunov exponents using the Jacobian matrix and the integration results.\n\nHere's a Python implementation using the SciPy library:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.linalg import qr\n\ndef rossler_system(t, state):\n    x, y, z = state\n    dx_dt = -y - z\n    dy_dt = x + 0.2 * y\n    dz_dt = 0.2 + z * (x - 5.7)\n    return [dx_dt, dy_dt, dz_dt]\n\ndef jacobian_matrix(state):\n    x, y, z = state\n    return np.array([[-0.0, -1.0, -1.0],\n                     [1.0, 0.2, 0.0],\n                     [z, 0.0, x - 5.7]])\n\ndef lyapunov_exponents(initial_state, integration_time, dt):\n    state = np.array(initial_state)\n    n = len(initial_state)\n    w = np.eye(n)\n    lyapunov_exponents = np.zeros(n)\n\n    for t in np.arange(0, integration_time, dt):\n        jacobian = jacobian_matrix(state)\n        w_next = np.dot(w + dt * np.dot(jacobian, w), np.eye(n))\n        q, r = qr(w_next)\n        w = q\n        lyapunov_exponents += dt * np.log(np.abs(np.diag(r)))\n\n    lyapunov_exponents /= integration_time\n    return lyapunov_exponents\n\ninitial_state = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]\nintegration_time = 1000\ndt = 0.01\n\nexponents = lyapunov_exponents(initial_state, integration_time, dt)\nprint(\"The first three positive Lyapunov exponents are:\", exponents)\n```\n\nThis code will output the first three positive Lyapunov exponents for the given initial conditions and integration time.
