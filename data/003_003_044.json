    "message_2": "If the angle is 45 degrees, we can convert it to radians by multiplying it with π/180:\n\n45 * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, using the unit circle in Trigonometry, we can find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for this angle:\n\nsin(π/4) = √2/2\ncos(π/4) = √2/2\ntan(π/4) = sin(π/4) / cos(π/4) = (√2/2) / (√2/2) = 1\n\nSo, the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for a 45-degree angle are:\n\nsin(45°) = √2/2\ncos(45°) = √2/2\ntan(45°) = 1"
