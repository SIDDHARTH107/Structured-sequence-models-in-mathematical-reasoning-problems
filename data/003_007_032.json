    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have a = 7, b = 9, and c = 10. We want to find the largest angle, which will be the angle opposite the longest side (c = 10). So, we need to find angle C.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c:\n\n10^2 = 7^2 + 9^2 - 2 * 7 * 9 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 49 + 81 - 126 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 130 - 126 * cos(C)\n\nNow, isolate cos(C):\n\n-30 = -126 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 30/126\n\ncos(C) = 1/4.2\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value we found:\n\nC = arccos(1/4.2)\n\nC ≈ 75.52°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 75.52°."
