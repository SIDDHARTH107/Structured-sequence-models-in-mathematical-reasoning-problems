    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (side length)^2\n\nIn this case, the side length is 5 cm. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (5 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 6 * 25 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 150 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube with a side length of 5 cm is 150 cm^2."
