    "message_2": "To find all solutions of the equation 2sin(x) = √3 for x ∈ [0, 2π], we first need to isolate sin(x).\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nsin(x) = (√3)/2\n\nNow, we need to find all angles x in the interval [0, 2π] that have a sine value of (√3)/2. Recall that sine is positive in the first and second quadrants.\n\nIn the first quadrant, the angle with a sine value of (√3)/2 is π/3 (or 60 degrees). This is because sin(π/3) = (√3)/2.\n\nIn the second quadrant, the angle with a sine value of (√3)/2 is 2π/3 (or 120 degrees). This is because sin(2π/3) = (√3)/2.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for the equation 2sin(x) = √3 for x ∈ [0, 2π] are x = π/3 and x = 2π/3."
