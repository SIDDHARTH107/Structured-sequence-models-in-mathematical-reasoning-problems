    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 2²) = √(9 + 4) = √13\n|B| = √(4² + (-1)²) = √(16 + 1) = √17\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, which can be found using the formula:\n\nA · B = (A_x * B_x) + (A_y * B_y)\n\nCalculating the dot product:\n\nA · B = (3 * 4) + (2 * -1) = 12 - 2 = 10\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = 10 / (√13 * √17) = 10 / (√221)\n\nSince we are asked to find the dot product, we already have the answer:\n\nA · B = 10"
