If the initial condition is y(0) = 1 and the time delay parameter is τ = 17, what is the predicted value of y at time t = 100 using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.01?",
    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.01, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the Mackey-Glass equation as a function.\n2. Implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n3. Iterate through the time steps and calculate the value of y at each step.\n4. Find the value of y at t = 100.\n\nFirst, let's define the Mackey-Glass equation as a function:\n\n```python\ndef mackey_glass(y_t, y_t_delay, tau=17):\n    return 0.2 * y_t_delay / (1 + y_t_delay**10) - 0.1 * y_t\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\ndef runge_kutta(y, t, h, tau, y_delay):\n    k1 = h * mackey_glass(y, y_delay, tau)\n    k2 = h * mackey_glass(y + 0.5 * k1, y_delay, tau)\n    k3 = h * mackey_glass(y + 0.5 * k2, y_delay, tau)\n    k4 = h * mackey_glass(y + k3, y_delay, tau)\n\n    return y + (k1 + 2 * k2 + 2 * k3 + k4) / 6\n```\n\nNow, let's iterate through the time steps and calculate the value of y at each step:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nt_final = 100\nh = 0.01\ntau = 17\nnum_steps = int(t_final / h) + 1\ny = np.zeros(num_steps)\ny[0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(1, num_steps):\n    t = i * h\n    t_delay = t - tau\n\n    if t_delay < 0:\n        y_delay = 1  # y(0) = 1\n    else:\n        y_delay = y[int(t_delay / h)]\n\n    y[i] = runge_kutta(y[i - 1], t, h, tau, y_delay)\n```\n\nFinally, let's find the value of y at t = 100:\n\n```python\ny_100 = y[-1]\nprint(\"The predicted value of y at time t = 100 is:\", y_100)\n```\n\nThis will give you the predicted value of y at time t = 100 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.01. Note that the actual value may vary slightly depending on the implementation and numerical precision."
