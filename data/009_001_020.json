    "message_1": "A population of rabbits in a forest is modeled by the differential equation:\n\ndy/dt = 0.2y - 0.00005y^2\n\nwhere y is the population size in thousands and t is time in years. \n\nIf the initial population is 5000 rabbits, what will be the population after 5 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the constant of integration. The differential equation is:\n\ndy/dt = 0.2y - 0.00005y^2\n\nThis is a first-order separable differential equation. We can rewrite it as:\n\ndy/(0.2y - 0.00005y^2) = dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫(1/(0.2y - 0.00005y^2)) dy = ∫(1) dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use the substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 0.2y - 0.00005y^2\ndu/dy = 0.2 - 0.0001y\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫(1/u) (du/(0.2 - 0.0001y)) dy = ∫(1) dt\n\nThe left side integral becomes:\n\n∫(1/u) du = ∫(1) dt\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides:\n\nln|u| = t + C₁\nln|0.2y - 0.00005y^2| = t + C₁\n\nTo remove the natural logarithm, we can use the exponential function:\n\n0.2y - 0.00005y^2 = e^(t + C₁)\n0.2y - 0.00005y^2 = e^t * e^C₁\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition y(0) = 5 (since the population is in thousands):\n\n0.2(5) - 0.00005(5)^2 = e^(0) * e^C₁\n1 - 0.00005(25) = e^C₁\n1 - 0.00125 = e^C₁\n0.99875 = e^C₁\n\nNow, we can substitute C₁ back into the equation:\n\n0.2y - 0.00005y^2 = 0.99875 * e^t\n\nWe want to find the population after 5 years, so we need to find y(5):\n\n0.2y - 0.00005y^2 = 0.99875 * e^(5)\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n0.2y - 0.00005y^2 = 0.99875 * e^5\n\nThis equation is a quadratic equation in y, which can be solved using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or by using a calculator or software. Using a calculator, we find:\n\ny ≈ 7.927\n\nSince the population is in thousands, the population after 5 years is approximately:\n\n7.927 * 1000 ≈ 7927 rabbits."
