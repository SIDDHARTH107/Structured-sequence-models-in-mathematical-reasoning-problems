    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of the curve X with the line L, we need to substitute $z=0$ into the equation of the curve X:\n\n$y^2(0) - x(x-0)(x-\\lambda(0)) = y^2(0) - x^3 = 0$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x^3 = 0$\n\nThe only solution for x in the projective plane is $x=0$. Now, we need to find the corresponding y and z values for this intersection point. Since z=0 on the line L, we have the point $(0:y:0)$ in the projective plane. However, this point is not valid in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ because at least one of the coordinates must be non-zero.\n\nTo find a valid point, we can look at the original equation of the curve X and set x=0:\n\n$y^2z - 0(0-z)(0-\\lambda z) = y^2z = 0$\n\nSince x=0, we must have either y=0 or z=0. We already know that z=0 on the line L, so we must have y=0. Therefore, the intersection point is $(0:0:1)$, which is a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the intersection number, which is the number of times the curve X intersects the line L at this point. Since the curve X is of degree 3, it can intersect the line L at most 3 times. However, we have only found one intersection point, so the intersection number is 1.\n\nThus, the intersection number of the curve X with the line L defined by $z=0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is 1."
