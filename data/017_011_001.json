    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 12 is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems and then show that these structures correspond to the given groups.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G of order 12. The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3^1. Thus, we have Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 4 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is n_3 = 1. Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3, of order 3, and it must be normal in G since all Sylow 3-subgroups are conjugate.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 3 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 3. We will consider these cases separately.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, say P_2, of order 4, then it must also be normal in G. In this case, we have two normal subgroups P_2 and P_3 with orders 4 and 3, respectively. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, consider the product of these subgroups: P_2 * P_3. Since P_2 and P_3 are normal, this product is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, by the product formula, the order of P_2 * P_3 is |P_2 * P_3| = (|P_2| * |P_3|) / |P_2 ∩ P_3| = (4 * 3) / 1 = 12. Thus, P_2 * P_3 = G.\n\nSince G is the product of two cyclic subgroups of orders 4 and 3, G must be a cyclic group of order 12. Therefore, in this case, G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3\nIf there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, none of them are normal in G. Let P_3 be the normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Since P_3 is normal, we can form the semidirect product of G with P_3 and one of the Sylow 2-subgroups, say P_2. The semidirect product depends on the action of P_2 on P_3, which is determined by a homomorphism φ: P_2 → Aut(P_3).\n\nSince P_3 is of order 3, it is isomorphic to C3, and its automorphism group Aut(P_3) is isomorphic to C2. Now, P_2 is of order 4, so it can be either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If P_2 is isomorphic to C4, then there is no nontrivial homomorphism φ: P_2 → Aut(P_3), as the order of Aut(P_3) is 2, which does not divide the order of P_2. This contradicts the fact that G is not a direct product of P_2 and P_3.\n\nTherefore, P_2 must be isomorphic to V4. In this case, there is a nontrivial homomorphism φ: P_2 → Aut(P_3), and the semidirect product G corresponds to the group D6, the dihedral group of order 12.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a group G of order 12 must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, depending on the structure of its Sylow subgroups."
