    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. The length of the Peano curve is infinite, as it is a fractal curve that can be subdivided infinitely many times.\n\nHowever, if you are asking about the length of an approximation of the Peano curve after a certain number of iterations, we can calculate that.\n\nIf the original square is divided into 16 smaller squares, this means that the square is divided into a 4x4 grid. In this case, the Peano curve would have 3 iterations (since 4 = 2^2, and the Peano curve is based on a 3x3 grid).\n\nAfter each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by 3. So, if the side length of the original square is L, the length of the first iteration of the Peano curve would be 3L, the second iteration would be 3^2 * L = 9L, and the third iteration would be 3^3 * L = 27L.\n\nSo, if the original square is divided into 16 smaller squares and the Peano curve has 3 iterations, the length of the approximation of the Peano curve would be 27 times the side length of the original square (27L)."
