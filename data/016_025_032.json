    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski sieve construction, the number of filled triangles at each stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of filled triangles = 3^(n-1), where n is the stage number.\n\nFor the fifth stage (n=5), the total number of filled triangles is:\n\nNumber of filled triangles = 3^(5-1) = 3^4 = 81.\n\nSo, there are 81 filled triangles in the fifth stage of the Sierpinski sieve construction."
