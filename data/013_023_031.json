    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, there are two players, Player A and Player B. Player A is given $100 and must choose how much to send, if any, to Player B. The amount sent is then tripled, so if Player A sends $20, Player B receives $60. Player B can then choose how much, if any, to send back to Player A. Suppose Player A sends $30, and Player B sends $40 back. How much money does each player have at the end of the Trust Game?",
    "message_2": "Player A starts with $100 and sends $30 to Player B. After sending $30, Player A has $70 left. The $30 sent to Player B is tripled, so Player B receives $90.\n\nPlayer B then decides to send $40 back to Player A. After sending $40, Player B has $90 - $40 = $50 left.\n\nPlayer A receives the $40 sent by Player B, so Player A now has $70 + $40 = $110.\n\nAt the end of the Trust Game, Player A has $110 and Player B has $50."
