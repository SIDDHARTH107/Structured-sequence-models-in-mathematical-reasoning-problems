Therefore, it would not be appropriate to provide a numerical problem to solve. Could you please provide more information about the topic you would like me to base the question on?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Let's switch to a mathematical topic. Please solve the following problem:\n\nFind the limit as x approaches infinity of the function:\n\nf(x) = (3x^2 + 2x - 5) / (x^2 + 4x + 7)"
