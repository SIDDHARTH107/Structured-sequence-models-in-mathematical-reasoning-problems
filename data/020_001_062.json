    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. The production of X requires 5 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time per unit, while the production of Y requires 3 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time per unit. The company has 200 hours of labor and 160 hours of machine time available per day. The profit for each unit of X is $10 and for each unit of Y is $15. The company wants to maximize profit while meeting the labor and machine time constraints. How many units of each product should the company produce per day to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y produced per day.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n5x + 3y ≤ 200 (labor constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 160 (machine time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n5x + 3y ≤ 200 can be rewritten as y ≤ (-5/3)x + 200/3\n2x + 4y ≤ 160 can be rewritten as y ≤ -x/2 + 40\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 40), (30, 20), and (40, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 15(40) = $600\n3. P(30, 20) = 10(30) + 15(20) = $900\n4. P(40, 0) = 10(40) + 15(0) = $400\n\nThe maximum profit of $900 is achieved when the company produces 30 units of product X and 20 units of product Y per day."
