    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition between two firms where Firm 1 is the leader and Firm 2 is the follower. Both firms have identical cost functions given by C(q) = 10q, where q is the quantity produced. Firm 1 chooses its production level before Firm 2 and Firm 2 observes Firm 1’s production level before making its own production decision. \n\nIf the market demand is given by P(Q) = 100 - Q, where Q is the total quantity produced in the market, what is the Stackelberg equilibrium quantity produced by each firm?",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg equilibrium quantity produced by each firm, we need to first find the reaction function of Firm 2 (the follower) and then find the best response of Firm 1 (the leader) to Firm 2's reaction function.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function of Firm 2\nFirm 2's profit function is given by:\nπ2 = P(Q) * q2 - C(q2)\nπ2 = (100 - Q) * q2 - 10q2\nπ2 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 10q2\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 2 will choose q2 such that its first-order condition (FOC) is equal to zero:\n∂π2/∂q2 = 100 - q1 - 2q2 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for q2, we get Firm 2's reaction function:\nq2 = (90 - q1) / 2\n\nStep 2: Find the best response of Firm 1\nFirm 1's profit function is given by:\nπ1 = P(Q) * q1 - C(q1)\nπ1 = (100 - Q) * q1 - 10q1\nπ1 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 10q1\n\nSubstitute Firm 2's reaction function into Firm 1's profit function:\nπ1 = (100 - (q1 + (90 - q1) / 2)) * q1 - 10q1\nπ1 = (100 - q1 - 45 + q1/2) * q1 - 10q1\nπ1 = (55 - q1/2) * q1 - 10q1\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 1 will choose q1 such that its first-order condition (FOC) is equal to zero:\n∂π1/∂q1 = 55 - q1 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for q1, we get Firm 1's best response:\nq1 = 45\n\nStep 3: Find Firm 2's equilibrium quantity\nSubstitute Firm 1's best response into Firm 2's reaction function:\nq2 = (90 - 45) / 2\nq2 = 45 / 2\nq2 = 22.5\n\nSo, the Stackelberg equilibrium quantities produced by each firm are:\nFirm 1: q1 = 45\nFirm 2: q2 = 22.5"
