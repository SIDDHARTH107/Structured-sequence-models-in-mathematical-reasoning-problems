    "message_1": "Please note that Cryptographic hash functions are more theoretical and less numerical. Here is a question related to hashing that a math student could solve:\n\nAssume that you have a message consisting of 1000 characters. Write a Python program to compute the SHA256 hash of that message. What is the size of the hash value obtained in bytes?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can provide you with the size of the hash value obtained in bytes for the SHA256 hash function. The SHA256 hash function produces a fixed-size output of 256 bits, which is equivalent to 32 bytes.\n\nFor the Python program, you can use the hashlib library to compute the SHA256 hash of a message:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef compute_sha256_hash(message):\n    sha256 = hashlib.sha256()\n    sha256.update(message.encode('utf-8'))\n    return sha256.digest()\n\nmessage = \"A\" * 1000  # A message consisting of 1000 characters\nhash_value = compute_sha256_hash(message)\nprint(\"Hash value:\", hash_value)\nprint(\"Size of hash value in bytes:\", len(hash_value))\n```\n\nThis program will output the SHA256 hash value of the given message and its size in bytes, which should be 32 bytes."
