    "message_2": "Since the circle is tangent to both the x-axis and the y-axis, its center will be at the point (4, 4), because the radius is 4 units. The general equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is:\n\n(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²\n\nPlugging in the values for the center (4, 4) and the radius 4, we get:\n\n(x - 4)² + (y - 4)² = 4²\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n(x - 4)² + (y - 4)² = 16\n\nThis is the equation of the circle tangent to both the x-axis and the y-axis with a radius of 4."
