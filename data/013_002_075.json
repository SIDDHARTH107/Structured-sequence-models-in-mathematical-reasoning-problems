The payoff matrix for the game is as follows:\n\n|          | B: Stay | B: Move |\n| -------- | ------ | ------- |\n| A: Stay  | 1,1    | 0,0     |\n| A: Move  | 0,0    | 2,2     |\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the other player's strategy. In this game, there is one Nash equilibrium:\n\nBoth players choose the \"Move\" strategy. In this case, the payoff for both players is (2,2). If either player were to change their strategy to \"Stay,\" their payoff would decrease to (0,0). Therefore, neither player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the other player's strategy. So, the Nash equilibrium is (A: Move, B: Move) with a payoff of (2,2)."
