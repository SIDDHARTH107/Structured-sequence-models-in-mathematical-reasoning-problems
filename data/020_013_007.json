    "message_2": "To maximize the function f(x1, x2) = (x1)^2 + (x2)^2 subject to the constraint x1 + x2 = 1 and x1, x2 ≥ 0 using semi-definite programming, we first need to rewrite the problem in a standard form suitable for semi-definite programming.\n\nLet's define a matrix X as follows:\n\nX = | x1  0 |\n    | 0  x2 |\n\nThe objective function f(x1, x2) can be written as the trace of the product of two matrices:\n\nf(x1, x2) = Tr(AX) where A = | 1  0 |\n                                 | 0  1 |\n\nNow, we need to express the constraints in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The constraint x1 + x2 = 1 can be written as Tr(BX) = 1, where B = | 1  0 |\n                                                                                           | 0  1 |\n\nThe constraints x1, x2 ≥ 0 can be expressed as the matrix X being positive semi-definite, i.e., X ⪰ 0.\n\nNow, the problem can be formulated as a semi-definite programming problem:\n\nMaximize: Tr(AX)\nSubject to: Tr(BX) = 1\n                   X ⪰ 0\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use a semi-definite programming solver such as CVX, SDPT3, or SeDuMi. However, in this particular case, the problem can be solved analytically.\n\nSince x1 + x2 = 1, we can substitute x2 = 1 - x1. The objective function becomes:\n\nf(x1, x2) = (x1)^2 + (1 - x1)^2 = 2x1^2 - 2x1 + 1\n\nTo maximize this function, we can take the derivative with respect to x1 and set it to zero:\n\nd(f)/dx1 = 4x1 - 2 = 0\nx1 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can find x2:\n\nx2 = 1 - x1 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function f(x1, x2) is achieved at x1 = 1/2 and x2 = 1/2, and the maximum value is:\n\nf(1/2, 1/2) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2"
