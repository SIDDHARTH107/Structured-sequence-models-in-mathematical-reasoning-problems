    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the algebraic variety $X$ at point $P = (1, 1)$, we will first compute the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to $x$ and $y$. Then, we will use these partial derivatives to find the slope of the tangent line at $P$. Finally, we will use the point-slope form to find the equation of the tangent line.\n\n1. Compute the partial derivatives:\n\nThe defining equation of the algebraic variety $X$ is $x^2 + 2y^2 = 3$. We will compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + 2y^2) = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + 2y^2) = 4y$\n\n2. Evaluate the partial derivatives at $P = (1, 1)$:\n\nAt point $P = (1, 1)$, the partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + 2y^2) = 2(1) = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + 2y^2) = 4(1) = 4$\n\n3. Find the slope of the tangent line:\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at $P$ is given by the ratio of the partial derivatives:\n\n$m = -\\frac{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + 2y^2)}{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + 2y^2)} = -\\frac{2}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n4. Find the equation of the tangent line:\n\nUsing the point-slope form, the equation of the tangent line at $P = (1, 1)$ is:\n\n$y - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 1)$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n$2(y - 1) = -(x - 1)$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$2y - 2 = -x + 1$\n\n$x + 2y = 3$\n\nThus, the equation of the tangent line to the algebraic variety $X$ at point $P = (1, 1)$ is $x + 2y = 3$. Note that we didn't use the theory of derived categories, as it is not necessary for this problem. The method presented here is a standard approach in calculus and algebraic geometry."
