    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we first analyze the possible structures of groups of order 60. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the Sylow subgroups of a group G of order 60.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 * 5 = 15, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 * 5 = 20, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^2 * 3 = 12, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique normal Sylow subgroups for each prime divisor of its order. By the fourth isomorphism theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Thus, G is isomorphic to C4 × C3 × C5, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60. This is an abelian group.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G has unique normal Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup and P_3 be a Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product P_2 ⋊ P_3. Since P_2 is isomorphic to C4 and P_3 is isomorphic to C3, there are two possible semidirect products: C4 ⋊ C3 and C2 × C2 ⋊ C3. The first one is isomorphic to the alternating group A4, which is not of order 60. The second one is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3 × C2, which is also not of order 60. Thus, there are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique normal Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup and P_5 be a Sylow 5-subgroup. Then, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product P_2 ⋊ P_5. Since P_2 is isomorphic to C4 and P_5 is isomorphic to C5, there are two possible semidirect products: C4 ⋊ C5 and C2 × C2 ⋊ C5. The first one is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, which is not of order 60. The second one is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2, which is of order 60 but is not non-abelian. Thus, there are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G has unique normal Sylow 2-subgroups. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product P_2 ⋊ (P_3 × P_5), where P_3 is a Sylow 3-subgroup and P_5 is a Sylow 5-subgroup. Since P_2 is isomorphic to C4, there are two possible semidirect products: C4 ⋊ (C3 × C5) and C2 × C2 ⋊ (C3 × C5). The first one is isomorphic to the dihedral group D30, which is not of order 60. The second one is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 60, which we will denote as G_1. Thus, there is one non-abelian group in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one non-abelian group of order 60, which we denoted as G_1. Every group of order 60 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or the non-abelian group G_1."
