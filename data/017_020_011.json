    "message_2": "There are actually five non-abelian groups of order 40, not eight. Here is the list of all five of them:\n\n1. Dihedral group D_20: This group consists of symmetries of a regular 20-gon, including 20 rotations and 20 reflections. It has order 40 and is non-abelian.\n\n2. Semi-direct product C_5 ⋊ C_8: This group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 (C_5) and a cyclic group of order 8 (C_8). It is non-abelian and has order 40.\n\n3. Semi-direct product C_5 ⋊ Q_8: This group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 (C_5) and the quaternion group of order 8 (Q_8). It is non-abelian and has order 40.\n\n4. Semi-direct product C_2 ⋊ (C_4 × C_5): This group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 (C_2) and the direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 (C_4) and a cyclic group of order 5 (C_5). It is non-abelian and has order 40.\n\n5. Semi-direct product C_4 ⋊ (C_2 × C_5): This group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 (C_4) and the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 (C_2) and a cyclic group of order 5 (C_5). It is non-abelian and has order 40.\n\nThese are the five non-abelian groups of order 40 in the subject of Group theory."
