    "message_1": "A company is producing two types of products, A and B. The cost per unit of product A is $20, while the cost per unit of product B is $30. The maximum amount of raw material available to the company is 400 units. The company's profits per unit of product A and B are $10 and $15, respectively. However, there is a chance that the actual cost of raw material may be 20% more than the estimated cost in the budget. Formulate a robust optimization model to find the number of units of each type of product the company should produce to maximize their expected profit, taking into account the uncertain cost and the given constraints.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material constraint: 20x + 30y <= 400 (estimated cost)\n2. Non-negativity constraint: x >= 0, y >= 0\n\nNow, we need to consider the uncertainty in the cost of raw material. The actual cost of raw material may be 20% more than the estimated cost. So, we need to add a constraint to account for this uncertainty.\n\n3. Uncertain raw material constraint: (1.2 * 20)x + (1.2 * 30)y <= 400\n\nNow, we have a robust optimization model:\n\nMaximize profit = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to:\n1. 20x + 30y <= 400\n2. x >= 0, y >= 0\n3. 24x + 36y <= 400\n\nTo solve this optimization model, we can use linear programming techniques such as the simplex method or graphical method to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit while satisfying all the constraints."
