    "message_1": "A hospital is studying the survival times of patients diagnosed with a certain disease. They found that the survival times follow an exponential distribution with a mean of 5 months. What is the probability that a patient diagnosed with this disease will survive for more than 3 months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the exponential distribution formula. The probability density function (pdf) of an exponential distribution is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1/μ) * e^(-t/μ)\n\nwhere t is the survival time, μ is the mean survival time (in this case, 5 months), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nTo find the probability that a patient will survive for more than 3 months, we need to find the complement of the probability that they will survive for 3 months or less. This can be found using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution, which is given by:\n\nF(t) = 1 - e^(-t/μ)\n\nThe probability that a patient will survive for 3 months or less is:\n\nF(3) = 1 - e^(-3/5)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability that a patient will survive for more than 3 months by finding the complement of F(3):\n\nP(T > 3) = 1 - F(3)\n\nP(T > 3) = 1 - (1 - e^(-3/5))\n\nP(T > 3) = e^(-3/5)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probability:\n\nP(T > 3) ≈ e^(-3/5) ≈ 2.71828^(-0.6) ≈ 0.5493\n\nSo, the probability that a patient diagnosed with this disease will survive for more than 3 months is approximately 0.5493, or 54.93%."
