    "message_2": "The non-abelian group of order 20 is the semidirect product of Z_5 and Z_4, denoted as Z_5 ⋊ Z_4. This group has the following presentation:\n\nG = ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^2⟩\n\nNow, let's find the elements of order 2 in G. An element of order 2 is an element g such that g^2 = 1.\n\nFirst, consider the elements of the form a^i, where i is an integer. Since a has order 5, a^i will have order 5 or 1, but not 2.\n\nNext, consider the elements of the form b^j, where j is an integer. Since b has order 4, b^2 has order 2. Thus, b^2 is an element of order 2.\n\nFinally, consider the elements of the form a^i * b^j, where i and j are integers. We have:\n\n(a^i * b^j)^2 = a^(2i) * b^(2j) * a^(2i) * b^(2j) = a^(2i) * b^(2j) * a^(4i) * b^(4j) = a^(2i) * b^(2j) * a^(4i) = a^(2i) * a^(4i) * b^(2j) = a^(6i) * b^(2j)\n\nSince a has order 5, a^(6i) = a^(i). Thus, (a^i * b^j)^2 = a^(i) * b^(2j). For this product to be equal to 1, we need a^(i) = 1 and b^(2j) = 1. The first condition implies that i is a multiple of 5, and the second condition implies that j is a multiple of 2.\n\nSo, the elements of order 2 in G are of the form a^(5k) * b^(2l) = b^(2l), where k and l are integers. Since b has order 4, there are 2 elements of order 2 in G: b^0 = 1 and b^2.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 elements of order 2 in the non-abelian group of order 20."
