    "message_2": "To show that the group law on C induces a group structure on the set of all points of C with rational coordinates, we need to verify the group axioms for the set of rational points on C. Let's denote the set of rational points on C as C(Q). The group law on C is given by the addition of points on the elliptic curve using the chord-and-tangent method.\n\n1. Closure: We need to show that for any two points P, Q ∈ C(Q), their sum R = P + Q is also in C(Q). Let P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2) be two points in C(Q). According to the group law on elliptic curves, we can find the coordinates of R = (x3, y3) using the following formulas:\n\nIf P ≠ Q:\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nx3 = m^2 - x1 - x2\ny3 = m(x1 - x3) - y1\n\nIf P = Q:\nm = (3x1^2 - 2) / (2y1)\nx3 = m^2 - 2x1\ny3 = m(x1 - x3) - y1\n\nSince the coordinates of P and Q are rational, the coordinates of R will also be rational due to the arithmetic operations involved in the formulas. Therefore, R ∈ C(Q), and the closure property holds.\n\n2. Identity: The point at infinity, denoted as O, serves as the identity element for the group law on elliptic curves. For any point P ∈ C(Q), we have P + O = P.\n\n3. Inverses: For any point P = (x, y) ∈ C(Q), its inverse -P is given by (x, -y). Since the coordinates of P are rational, the coordinates of -P are also rational. Therefore, -P ∈ C(Q). Moreover, P + (-P) = O, the identity element.\n\n4. Associativity: The group law on elliptic curves is associative, i.e., for any points P, Q, R ∈ C(Q), we have (P + Q) + R = P + (Q + R). This property is a consequence of the geometric interpretation of the group law using the chord-and-tangent method.\n\nSince all the group axioms are satisfied, the group law on C induces a group structure on the set of all points of C with rational coordinates, C(Q).\n\nAs for the order of the group, it is not possible to determine the exact order without more information or computation. The order of an elliptic curve group over the rational numbers is generally infinite, and finding the order involves finding the rank and torsion subgroup of the curve. This typically requires more advanced techniques, such as the Mordell-Weil theorem and the Lutz-Nagell theorem."
