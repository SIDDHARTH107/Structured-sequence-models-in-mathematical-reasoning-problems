    "message_2": "The intersection of X with the hyperplane H is given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$. This is a Fermat cubic curve, which is a smooth curve of genus 1.\n\nIntersection cohomology groups are related to the usual cohomology groups of a space. In particular, for a smooth curve C of genus g, we have $IH^2(C) \\cong H^2(C)$, and the dimension of $H^2(C)$ is given by the Euler characteristic formula: $\\chi(C) = 2 - 2g$.\n\nIn our case, the genus of the Fermat cubic curve is 1, so the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(C) = 2 - 2(1) = 0$. Therefore, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group $IH^2(X \\cap H)$ is 0."
