    "message_2": "To find the vertex and axis of symmetry of the given absolute value equation, we first need to rewrite the equation in the vertex form of an absolute value function, which is:\n\ny = a|x - h| + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the function.\n\nFirst, let's isolate y in the given equation:\n\ny = -3 + 2x + 1\n\nNow, we have:\n\ny = 2|x - 0| - 2\n\nComparing this equation to the vertex form, we can see that:\n\na = 2\nh = 0\nk = -2\n\nSo, the vertex of the function is (0, -2).\n\nThe axis of symmetry of an absolute value function is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. In this case, the axis of symmetry is x = h, which is:\n\nx = 0\n\nThus, the vertex of the given absolute value equation is (0, -2) and the axis of symmetry is x = 0."
