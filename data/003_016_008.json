    "message_1": "The equation y = 4cos(2x - π/4) represents the vertical displacement of an oscillating object. What is the phase shift of this trigonometric function?",
    "message_2": "The general form of a cosine function is y = A*cos(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 4cos(2x - π/4), we can see that A = 4, B = 2, and C = π/4. The phase shift is represented by the value of C.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift of this trigonometric function is π/4."
