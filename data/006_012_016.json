    "message_2": "We can model this situation using the Poisson distribution, which is used to calculate the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given the average rate of occurrence (λ).\n\nIn this case, the average number of robberies per day (λ) is 0.2. We want to find the probability of a robbery occurring in a given day, which means we want to find the probability of k = 1 robbery.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of k events occurring\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average rate of occurrence (0.2 in this case)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (1 in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(1) = (e^(-0.2) * 0.2^1) / 1!\n\nP(1) = (0.8187 * 0.2) / 1\n\nP(1) = 0.1637\n\nSo, the probability of a robbery occurring in a particular neighborhood in a given day is approximately 0.1637 or 16.37%."
