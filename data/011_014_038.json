    "message_2": "Let's use the Handshaking Theorem, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nLet E be the number of edges in the graph. We have 8 vertices of degree 3 and 4 vertices of degree 2. So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is:\n\n8 * 3 + 4 * 2 = 24 + 8 = 32\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Theorem, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to 2 * E:\n\n32 = 2 * E\n\nNow, we can solve for E:\n\nE = 32 / 2 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 edges in this graph."
