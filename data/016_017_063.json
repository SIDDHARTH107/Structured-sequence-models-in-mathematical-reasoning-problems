    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon is a fractal curve, and its perimeter increases with each iteration. After each iteration, the perimeter of the Heighway Dragon is doubled. \n\nSo, after the 8th iteration, the perimeter will be:\n\nInitial length * 2^iterations = 1 * 2^8 = 1 * 256 = 256 units."
