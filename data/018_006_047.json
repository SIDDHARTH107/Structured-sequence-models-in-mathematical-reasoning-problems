    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ A' = U, we need to show that every element in U is also in A ∪ A', and vice versa.\n\nFirst, let's consider the elements in A ∪ A'. By definition of the union operation, an element is in A ∪ A' if it is in A or in A' (or both). Since A and A' are complements, every element in U is either in A or A'. Therefore, all elements in U are also in A ∪ A'.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements in U. Since U is the universal set, it contains all possible elements under consideration, which includes all elements in A and A'. Therefore, all elements in A ∪ A' are also in U.\n\nSince all elements in U are in A ∪ A', and all elements in A ∪ A' are in U, we can conclude that A ∪ A' = U."
