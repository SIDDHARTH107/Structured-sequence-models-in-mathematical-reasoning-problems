    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2x+1)/(x-3) = 5/2, we will first eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying.\n\n(2x + 1)(2) = (x - 3)(5)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers on both sides of the equation:\n\n4x + 2 = 5x - 15\n\nNext, we will move all the terms with x to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:\n\n4x - 5x = -15 - 2\n\n-1x = -17\n\nNow, divide by -1 to solve for x:\n\nx = 17"
