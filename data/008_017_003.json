    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system of equations in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA = |  3   2  -1 |\n    |  4  -4   5 |\n    | -2   3  -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | -9  |\n    | 16  |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv) and then multiply it with matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nA_inv = |  0.2   0.1  -0.3 |\n        |  0.1  -0.1   0.1 |\n        |  0.4   0.2   0.1 |\n\nNow, we multiply A_inv with B to get X:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = |  0.2   0.1  -0.3 |   |  7  |\n    |  0.1  -0.1   0.1 | * | -9  |\n    |  0.4   0.2   0.1 |   | 16  |\n\nX = | (0.2 * 7) + (0.1 * -9) + (-0.3 * 16) |\n    | (0.1 * 7) + (-0.1 * -9) + (0.1 * 16) |\n    | (0.4 * 7) + (0.2 * -9) + (0.1 * 16) |\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n    | 3 |\n\nSo, the solution for the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
