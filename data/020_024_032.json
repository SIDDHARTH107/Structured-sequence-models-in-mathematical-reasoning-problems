    "message_1": "Consider a company that sells a product for $50 per unit. The company's fixed costs are $5000 and the variable cost per unit is $10. What is the optimal number of units to produce and sell in order to maximize the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of units to produce and sell to maximize the company's profit, we need to first determine the profit function. The profit function is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function.\n\nThe revenue function is the price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold (q): R(q) = 50q.\n\nThe cost function consists of the fixed costs and the variable costs. The fixed costs are $5000, and the variable cost per unit is $10. So, the cost function is: C(q) = 5000 + 10q.\n\nNow, we can find the profit function by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function: P(q) = R(q) - C(q) = 50q - (5000 + 10q).\n\nSimplifying the profit function, we get: P(q) = 40q - 5000.\n\nTo find the optimal number of units to produce and sell, we need to find the value of q that maximizes the profit function. Since the profit function is linear, the profit will continue to increase as the number of units produced and sold increases. Therefore, there is no specific optimal number of units to produce and sell, as the company's profit will continue to increase as they produce and sell more units. However, it's important to consider other factors such as market demand and production capacity, which may limit the number of units that can be produced and sold."
