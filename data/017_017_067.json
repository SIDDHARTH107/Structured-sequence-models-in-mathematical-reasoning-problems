    "message_1": "There are three groups of order 30, name them A, B, and C. The number of elements of order 3 in group A is 10, in group B it is 20, and in group C it is 0. Identify which group out of A, B, and C is the non-abelian group of order 30.",
    "message_2": "To identify the non-abelian group of order 30, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G, denoted by n_2, divides 15 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, divides 10 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, divides 6 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information about the groups A, B, and C:\n\nGroup A: There are 10 elements of order 3, which means there are 10/2 = 5 Sylow 3-subgroups (since each subgroup has 2 elements of order 3). Thus, n_3 = 10 for group A.\n\nGroup B: There are 20 elements of order 3, which means there are 20/2 = 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. Thus, n_3 = 10 for group B.\n\nGroup C: There are 0 elements of order 3, which means there are no Sylow 3-subgroups. This is not possible for a group of order 30, as n_3 must be 1 or 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the non-abelian property. If a group has a unique Sylow p-subgroup for every prime p dividing its order, then the group is abelian. In our case, if a group has unique Sylow 2, 3, and 5-subgroups, it must be abelian.\n\nGroup A: n_3 = 10, so it does not have a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Therefore, group A could be non-abelian.\n\nGroup B: n_3 = 10, so it does not have a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Therefore, group B could also be non-abelian.\n\nSince group C does not satisfy the conditions for a group of order 30, we can ignore it.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of groups A and B is non-abelian. Since both groups have n_3 = 10, we can look at the number of elements of order 3 to differentiate between them.\n\nIn a non-abelian group, the number of elements of order p for a prime p dividing the group order is always greater than p. In our case, the number of elements of order 3 in group A is 10, and in group B, it is 20. Since 20 > 10 > 3, group B has more elements of order 3 than group A, making it more likely to be non-abelian.\n\nThus, the non-abelian group of order 30 among the given groups is group B."
