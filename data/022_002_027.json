    "message_2": "To find the conformal map, we can use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. \n\nWe want to find a Möbius transformation that maps the unit disc to the upper half-plane and sends $0$ to $i$. Let's start by finding the transformation that sends $0$ to $i$. If we plug in $z = 0$, we get:\n\n$$f(0) = \\frac{a(0) + b}{c(0) + d} = \\frac{b}{d} = i$$\n\nNow, we want to find the transformation that maps the unit disc to the upper half-plane. We know that the boundary of the unit disc is the circle $|z| = 1$, and the boundary of the upper half-plane is the real axis. Möbius transformations map circles to circles or lines, so we want to find a transformation that maps the unit circle to the real axis.\n\nLet's consider three points on the unit circle: $1, i, -1$. We want to find a Möbius transformation that maps these points to the real axis. We can do this by finding a transformation that maps $1$ to $1$, $i$ to $\\infty$, and $-1$ to $-1$. This transformation has the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - i}{z + i}$$\n\nLet's check if this transformation maps the three points correctly:\n\n$$f(1) = \\frac{1 - i}{1 + i} = \\frac{(1 - i)^2}{(1 + i)(1 - i)} = \\frac{1 - 2i + i^2}{1 - i^2} = \\frac{1 - 2i - 1}{1 + 1} = 1$$\n\n$$f(i) = \\frac{i - i}{i + i} = \\frac{0}{2i} = 0 \\cdot \\infty = \\infty$$\n\n$$f(-1) = \\frac{-1 - i}{-1 + i} = \\frac{(-1 - i)^2}{(-1 + i)(-1 - i)} = \\frac{1 + 2i + i^2}{1 - i^2} = \\frac{1 + 2i - 1}{1 + 1} = -1$$\n\nSo, this transformation maps the unit circle to the real axis. Now, we need to find the transformation that maps the interior of the unit disc to the upper half-plane. Since the transformation maps the boundary of the unit disc to the real axis, it must map the interior of the unit disc to one of the two half-planes. We can check which half-plane it maps to by plugging in a point inside the unit disc, such as $z = 0$:\n\n$$f(0) = \\frac{0 - i}{0 + i} = -1$$\n\nSince $-1$ is in the lower half-plane, the transformation maps the interior of the unit disc to the lower half-plane. To get the transformation that maps the unit disc to the upper half-plane, we can simply multiply the function by $-1$:\n\n$$g(z) = -f(z) = -\\frac{z - i}{z + i}$$\n\nNow, let's check if this transformation maps $0$ to $i$:\n\n$$g(0) = -\\frac{0 - i}{0 + i} = i$$\n\nSo, the conformal map that transforms the unit disc onto the upper half-plane and sends $0$ to $i$ is:\n\n$$g(z) = -\\frac{z - i}{z + i}$$"
