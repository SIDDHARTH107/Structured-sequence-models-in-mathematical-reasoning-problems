    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to determine if it is an even or odd function. Since f(x) = x^2 for -π < x < 0 and f(x) = x for 0 ≤ x < π, the function is neither even nor odd. Therefore, we need to find the general Fourier series representation.\n\nThe general Fourier series representation of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and n is an integer.\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] x^2 dx + ∫[0, π] x dx]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3) * x^3 |[-π, 0] + (1/2) * x^2 |[0, π]]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3) * (0 - (-π)^3) + (1/2) * (π^2 - 0)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3) * π^3 + (1/2) * π^2]\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] x^2 * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] x * cos(n * x) dx]\n\nFor the first integral, we can use integration by parts twice to find the result. For the second integral, we can use integration by parts once. After calculating these integrals, we get:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(1 - (-1)^n) / (n^2) - (2 * π * (-1)^n) / n]\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] x^2 * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] x * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nFor both integrals, we can use integration by parts. After calculating these integrals, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(2 * π * (-1)^n) / n - (1 - (-1)^n) / (n^2)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = (1/π) * [(1/3) * π^3 + (1/2) * π^2] + Σ [(2/π) * [(1 - (-1)^n) / (n^2) - (2 * π * (-1)^n) / n] * cos(n * x) + (2/π) * [(2 * π * (-1)^n) / n - (1 - (-1)^n) / (n^2)] * sin(n * x)]"
