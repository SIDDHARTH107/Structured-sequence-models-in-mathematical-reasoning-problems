    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by iterating the Koch curve process. In each iteration, every straight line segment is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. \n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment, so the total length is 4 * (1/3) = 4/3 times the original length.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the 4 segments is replaced by 4 segments again, resulting in 4^2 = 16 segments, each 1/3^2 = 1/9 the length of the original segment. The total length is now 16/9 times the original length.\n\nAfter the third iteration, there are 4^3 = 64 segments, each 1/3^3 = 1/27 the length of the original segment. The total length is now 64/27 times the original length.\n\nAfter the fourth iteration, there are 4^4 = 256 segments, each 1/3^4 = 1/81 the length of the original segment. The total length is now 256/81 times the original length.\n\nIf the original line segment has a length of 3 units, the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after the 4th iteration is:\n\n(256/81) * 3 = 768/81 â‰ˆ 9.4815 units."
