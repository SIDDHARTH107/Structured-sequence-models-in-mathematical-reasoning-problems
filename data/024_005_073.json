    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and their corresponding principal directions at the point (1,1,2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms for the given surface.\n\nGiven the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we can define the position vector r(u,v) as:\n\nr(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [r_u • r_u, r_u • r_v]\n      [r_v • r_u, r_v • r_v]\n\nI = [1 + 4u^2, 4uv]\n      [4uv, 1 + 4v^2]\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nI = [5, 4]\n      [4, 5]\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 2)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [r_uu • N, r_uv • N]\n         [r_vu • N, r_vv • N]\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector to the surface, which can be found by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (2u, 2v, -1)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nN = (2, 2, -1)\n\nNow, we normalize N:\n\n|N| = sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(9) = 3\n\nN_normalized = (2/3, 2/3, -1/3)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form:\n\nII = [r_uu • N_normalized, r_uv • N_normalized]\n         [r_vu • N_normalized, r_vv • N_normalized]\n\nII = [2(-1/3), 2(-1/3)]\n         [2(-1/3), 2(-1/3)]\n\nII = [-2/3, -2/3]\n         [-2/3, -2/3]\n\nNow, we find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) by solving the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(II - kI) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n(k + 2/3)^2 - (-2/3)^2 = 0\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk1 = 0\nk2 = -4/3\n\nNow, we find the corresponding principal directions by solving the eigenvector problem:\n\n(I - kI)X = 0\n\nFor k1 = 0:\n\n[5, 4] [x1] = [0]\n[4, 5] [x2]   [0]\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx1 = -x2\n\nThe principal direction corresponding to k1 = 0 is:\n\ne1 = (1, -1)\n\nFor k2 = -4/3:\n\n[5 + 4/3, 4] [x1] = [0]\n[4, 5 + 4/3] [x2]   [0]\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx1 = x2\n\nThe principal direction corresponding to k2 = -4/3 is:\n\ne2 = (1, 1)\n\nIn conclusion, the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,2) are k1 = 0 and k2 = -4/3, and their corresponding principal directions are e1 = (1, -1) and e2 = (1, 1)."
