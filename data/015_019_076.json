    "message_2": "Calculating the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a specific system requires numerical simulations and is beyond the scope of a simple text-based AI. However, I can provide you with the general approach to compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a given dynamical system.\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of a dynamical system to initial conditions. A positive maximum Lyapunov exponent indicates chaos, while a negative or zero exponent indicates stability.\n\nTo compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Henon-Heiles system, you would need to:\n\n1. Define the Henon-Heiles system equations with the given parameters.\n2. Choose a set of initial conditions for the system.\n3. Integrate the system equations over a certain time period using a numerical integration method (e.g., Runge-Kutta).\n4. Calculate the Jacobian matrix of the system at each time step.\n5. Compute the Lyapunov exponents by analyzing the growth rate of small perturbations in the system.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for several sets of initial conditions and average the results to obtain a more accurate estimate of the maximum Lyapunov exponent.\n\nThis process typically requires specialized software or programming skills to perform the numerical simulations and calculations."
