    "message_2": "To find the probability of a robbery occurring in a certain neighborhood during a month, we can use the Poisson probability formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, robberies) occurring in a fixed interval of time (a month).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-位) * 位^x) / x!\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x events (robberies) occurring in the given time interval (a month)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- 位 is the average number of events (robberies) in the given time interval (a month)\n- x! is the factorial of x (the product of all positive integers up to x)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the historical average frequency of robberies from 3 per year to a monthly average. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can divide 3 by 12:\n\n位 = 3 / 12 = 0.25 robberies per month\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one robbery occurring during a month. To do this, we can find the probability of zero robberies occurring and then subtract that from 1:\n\nP(0) = (e^(-0.25) * 0.25^0) / 0! = (0.7788 * 1) / 1 = 0.7788\n\nNow, subtract the probability of zero robberies from 1 to find the probability of at least one robbery:\n\nP(at least 1) = 1 - P(0) = 1 - 0.7788 = 0.2212\n\nSo, the probability of a robbery occurring in this neighborhood during a month is approximately 0.2212 or 22.12%."
