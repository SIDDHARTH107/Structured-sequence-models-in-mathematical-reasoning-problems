    "message_1": "A survey of 100 consumers showed that 70% prefer to purchase products online. What is the probability that out of a random sample of 10 consumers, at least 8 prefer online shopping?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, consumers who prefer online shopping) in n trials (in this case, a sample of 10 consumers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.7 or 70%)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, we want to find the probability of at least 8 successes, so we will calculate for k = 8, 9, and 10)\n\nFirst, we will calculate the probabilities for k = 8, 9, and 10:\n\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0\n\nNow, we will calculate the combinations:\n\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8!2!) = 45\nC(10, 9) = 10! / (9!1!) = 10\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10!0!) = 1\n\nNow, we will plug these values into the probability formula:\n\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2 ≈ 0.233\nP(X = 9) = 10 * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1 ≈ 0.121\nP(X = 10) = 1 * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0 ≈ 0.028\n\nFinally, we will add these probabilities together to find the probability of at least 8 successes:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) ≈ 0.233 + 0.121 + 0.028 ≈ 0.382\n\nSo, the probability that at least 8 out of 10 consumers prefer online shopping is approximately 38.2%."
