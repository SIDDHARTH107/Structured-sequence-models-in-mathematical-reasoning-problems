    "message_2": "Let's denote the plane's velocity vector as P and the wind's velocity vector as W. We want to find the angle θ between these two vectors.\n\nSince the plane is flying northwards, its velocity vector can be represented as P = (0, 400) km/h. The wind is blowing in the northeast direction, which means it has equal components in the east and north directions. So, the wind's velocity vector can be represented as W = (100, 100) km/h.\n\nTo find the angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nP • W = |P| * |W| * cos(θ)\n\nWhere P • W is the dot product of the two vectors, |P| and |W| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product:\n\nP • W = (0 * 100) + (400 * 100) = 0 + 40000 = 40000\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|P| = sqrt(0^2 + 400^2) = sqrt(0 + 160000) = 400\n|W| = sqrt(100^2 + 100^2) = sqrt(10000 + 10000) = sqrt(20000) = 100√2\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n40000 = 400 * 100√2 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = 40000 / (400 * 100√2) = 40000 / 40000√2 = 1/√2\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(1/√2) = 45°\n\nSo, the angle between the plane's velocity vector and the wind's velocity vector is 45°."
