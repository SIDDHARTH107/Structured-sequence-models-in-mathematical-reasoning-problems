If a customer randomly selects 25 bulbs from this plant, what is the probability that the average life expectancy of these bulbs is less than 1900 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. \n\nMean of the sampling distribution (μx̄) = Population mean (μ) = 2000 hours\n\nStandard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx̄) = Population standard deviation (σ) / √(sample size (n))\nσx̄ = 100 hours / √25\nσx̄ = 100 hours / 5\nσx̄ = 20 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for 1900 hours:\n\nz = (x̄ - μx̄) / σx̄\nz = (1900 - 2000) / 20\nz = -100 / 20\nz = -5\n\nNow, we can use a z-table or calculator to find the probability that the average life expectancy of the 25 bulbs is less than 1900 hours. The probability corresponding to a z-score of -5 is very close to 0 (less than 0.0001). \n\nSo, the probability that the average life expectancy of the 25 bulbs is less than 1900 hours is approximately 0, or less than 0.01%."
