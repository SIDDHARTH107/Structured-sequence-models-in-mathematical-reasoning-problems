    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 10 cm in this case. Let's denote the angle opposite the 10 cm side as C. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle. In this case, a = 6 cm, b = 8 cm, and c = 10 cm. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n10² = 6² + 8² - 2 * 6 * 8 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 36 + 64 - 96 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 100 - 96 * cos(C)\n\n0 = - 96 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 0\n\nSince cos(C) = 0, the angle C is 90 degrees. Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
