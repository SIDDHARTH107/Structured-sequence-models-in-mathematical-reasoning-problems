    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem:\n\nA metal plate of thickness 5 mm is initially at a uniform temperature of 100°C. It is suddenly exposed to a fluid at 0°C on one side while the other side is kept at 200°C. Using the Fourier transform, determine the temperature distribution within the plate at time t=0.5 seconds. Assume the thermal diffusivity of the material is 9.8 x 10^-6 m^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional unsteady-state heat conduction equation with the Fourier transform. The equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the distance from the side exposed to the fluid.\n\nFirst, let's convert the thickness of the plate to meters: 5 mm = 0.005 m.\n\nWe can solve the heat conduction equation using the Fourier transform method. The solution for the temperature distribution T(x, t) is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = T₀ + 2(T₁ - T₀) / π Σ [1 / (2n - 1) * exp(-α * (2n - 1)² * π² * t / 4L²) * sin((2n - 1) * π * x / 2L)]\n\nwhere T₀ is the temperature of the fluid (0°C), T₁ is the temperature of the other side of the plate (200°C), L is the thickness of the plate (0.005 m), and the summation is taken over n = 1, 2, 3, ... to infinity.\n\nFor practical purposes, we can truncate the summation to a finite number of terms (e.g., 100 terms) to get an approximate solution.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and calculate the temperature distribution T(x, t) at t = 0.5 seconds:\n\nT(x, 0.5) = 0 + 2(200 - 0) / π Σ [1 / (2n - 1) * exp(-9.8 * 10^-6 * (2n - 1)² * π² * 0.5 / 4 * 0.005²) * sin((2n - 1) * π * x / 2 * 0.005)]\n\nBy calculating the summation for n = 1 to 100, we can obtain the temperature distribution T(x, 0.5) within the plate at t = 0.5 seconds. The temperature will vary along the x-axis, with higher temperatures closer to the side kept at 200°C and lower temperatures closer to the side exposed to the fluid at 0°C."
