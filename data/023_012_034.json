    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We can find the b_n coefficients using the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nx) dx) from -π to π\n\nFor f(x) = 1, when -π < x < 0:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫(sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0\n\nIntegrating sin(nx) with respect to x, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-cos(nx)/n] from -π to 0\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-cos(0) + cos(nπ))/n]\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(1 - cos(nπ))/n]\n\nFor f(x) = -1, when 0 < x < π:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫(-sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π\n\nIntegrating -sin(nx) with respect to x, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [cos(nx)/n] from 0 to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(cos(nπ) - cos(0))/n]\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(cos(nπ) - 1)/n]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2/π) * [(1 - cos(nπ))/n] * sin(nx)] from n=1 to infinity\n\nFor the first 5 terms of the series, we have:\n\nf(x) ≈ (2/π) * [(1 - cos(π))/1] * sin(x) + (2/π) * [(1 - cos(2π))/2] * sin(2x) + (2/π) * [(1 - cos(3π))/3] * sin(3x) + (2/π) * [(1 - cos(4π))/4] * sin(4x) + (2/π) * [(1 - cos(5π))/5] * sin(5x)\n\nf(x) ≈ (2/π) * [2/1] * sin(x) + (2/π) * [0/2] * sin(2x) + (2/π) * [2/3] * sin(3x) + (2/π) * [0/4] * sin(4x) + (2/π) * [2/5] * sin(5x)\n\nf(x) ≈ (4/π) * sin(x) + (4/3π) * sin(3x) + (4/5π) * sin(5x)\n\nTo plot the first 5 terms of the series, you can use a graphing calculator or software like Desmos or Wolfram Alpha and input the following function:\n\n(4/π) * sin(x) + (4/3π) * sin(3x) + (4/5π) * sin(5x)"
