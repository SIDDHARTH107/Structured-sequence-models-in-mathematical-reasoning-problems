    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 sin(x) cos(x) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions that are being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x^2\nv(x) = sin(x) cos(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x\nv'(x) = sin(x) * (-sin(x)) + cos(x) * cos(x) [using the product rule for sin(x)cos(x)]\n\nv'(x) = -sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule to find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(sin(x)cos(x)) + (x^2)(-sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))\n\nf'(x) = 2x sin(x) cos(x) - x^2 sin^2(x) + x^2 cos^2(x)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^2 sin(x) cos(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x sin(x) cos(x) - x^2 sin^2(x) + x^2 cos^2(x)"
