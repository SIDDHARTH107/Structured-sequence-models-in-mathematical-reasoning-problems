    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 of each type (length x width, length x height, and width x height).\n\n1. Length x Width: 6 cm x 4 cm = 24 cm²\nThere are 2 faces of this type, so the total area is 2 x 24 cm² = 48 cm².\n\n2. Length x Height: 6 cm x 5 cm = 30 cm²\nThere are 2 faces of this type, so the total area is 2 x 30 cm² = 60 cm².\n\n3. Width x Height: 4 cm x 5 cm = 20 cm²\nThere are 2 faces of this type, so the total area is 2 x 20 cm² = 40 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together:\n\n48 cm² (length x width) + 60 cm² (length x height) + 40 cm² (width x height) = 148 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 cm²."
