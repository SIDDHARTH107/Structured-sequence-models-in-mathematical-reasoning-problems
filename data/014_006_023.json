    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"10101\" using the One-time pad encryption algorithm with the key \"01110\", you need to perform a bitwise XOR operation between the message and the key.\n\nMessage:  1 0 1 0 1\nKey:      0 1 1 1 0\n-------------------\nXOR:      1 1 0 1 1\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"11011\"."
