    "message_2": "To determine which group this Cayley table represents, let's analyze its properties.\n\n1. The table is clearly associative since it is a group operation.\n2. The identity element is 1, as the first row and column show.\n3. Each element has an inverse, as seen in the table.\n\nNow let's check the properties of each possible group:\n\nC8: The cyclic group of order 8.\n- This group has only one generator (an element that generates the entire group by repeated applications of the group operation). However, in this table, there is no single element that generates the entire group. For example, i^4 = 1, but i^2 = -1, and i^3 = -i, which only generates 4 elements. So, this group is not isomorphic to C8.\n\nQ8: The quaternion group of order 8.\n- This group has the following relations: i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. Let's check if these relations hold in the given table:\n  - i^2 = -1 (True)\n  - j^2 = -1 (True)\n  - k^2 = -1 (True)\n  - ijk = -1 (True, since i * j = k and k * k = -1)\n- Since all the relations hold, this group is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nD4: The dihedral group of order 8.\n- This group has two generators, r (rotation) and s (reflection), with the following relations: r^4 = s^2 = 1 and srs = r^(-1). However, in the given table, there is no pair of elements that satisfy these relations. So, this group is not isomorphic to D4.\n\nTherefore, the group represented by the given Cayley table is isomorphic to Q8, the quaternion group of order 8."
