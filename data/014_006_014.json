    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using the one-time pad encryption method, Alice needs to perform a bitwise XOR operation between the message and the random key. \n\nMessage: 10111010\nKey:     10010011\n-------------------\nXOR:     00101001\n\nSo, the encrypted message that Alice should send to Bob is \"00101001\"."
