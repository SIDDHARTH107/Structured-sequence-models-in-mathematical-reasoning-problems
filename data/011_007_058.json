    "message_1": "A company has 10 employees. In how many ways can the company choose a president, vice-president, and secretary if no person can hold more than 1 position?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 10 employees and no person can hold more than 1 position, we have:\n\n- 10 choices for the president\n- 9 choices for the vice-president (since the president has already been chosen)\n- 8 choices for the secretary (since the president and vice-president have already been chosen)\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose a president, vice-president, and secretary is:\n\n10 (choices for president) × 9 (choices for vice-president) × 8 (choices for secretary) = 720 ways."
