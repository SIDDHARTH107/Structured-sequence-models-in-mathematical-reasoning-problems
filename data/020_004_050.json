    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a quadratic programming problem for the student to solve:\n\nMinimize the function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 6y, subject to the constraint 2x + y >= 5. \n\nFind the minimum value of f(x,y) and the values of x and y that achieve it.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the gradient of the function f(x, y) and then analyze the constraint.\n\nThe gradient of f(x, y) is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y) = (2x - 4, 2y - 6)\n\nNow let's analyze the constraint:\n\n2x + y >= 5\n\nWe will consider the boundary of the constraint, which is the line 2x + y = 5. On this line, we can express y as a function of x:\n\ny = 5 - 2x\n\nNow we will substitute this expression for y into the gradient of f(x, y):\n\n∇f(x, 5 - 2x) = (2x - 4, 2(5 - 2x) - 6)\n\nTo find the minimum value of f(x, y) on the boundary, we need to find the point where the gradient is orthogonal to the boundary. The normal vector of the boundary is given by (2, 1), so we want to find the point where:\n\n(2x - 4, 2(5 - 2x) - 6) ∙ (2, 1) = 0\n\nExpanding the dot product, we get:\n\n(2x - 4) * 2 + (2(5 - 2x) - 6) * 1 = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n4x - 8 + 10 - 4x - 6 = 0\n\nCombining terms, we find that:\n\n-4 = 0\n\nSince this equation is not true, there is no point on the boundary where the gradient is orthogonal to the boundary. This means that the minimum value of f(x, y) must occur at one of the endpoints of the boundary.\n\nThe endpoints of the boundary are given by the intersections of the line 2x + y = 5 with the coordinate axes:\n\nx = 0, y = 5\nx = 2.5, y = 0\n\nNow we will evaluate f(x, y) at these endpoints:\n\nf(0, 5) = 0^2 + 5^2 - 4*0 - 6*5 = 25 - 30 = -5\nf(2.5, 0) = 2.5^2 + 0^2 - 4*2.5 - 6*0 = 6.25 - 10 = -3.75\n\nSince f(2.5, 0) = -3.75 is greater than f(0, 5) = -5, the minimum value of f(x, y) subject to the constraint is -5, which occurs at the point (x, y) = (0, 5)."
