    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into smaller tetrahedra. After each iteration, the number of small tetrahedra increases.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 4 small tetrahedra. After the second iteration, there are 4^2 = 16 small tetrahedra. In general, after n iterations, there are 4^n small tetrahedra.\n\nSo, after 5 iterations, there are 4^5 = 1024 small tetrahedra in the Sierpinski tetrahedron."
