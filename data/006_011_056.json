    "message_1": "A factory has 500 employees, of whom 30% use a certain type of machine. The probability of an accident occurring when someone is using this machine is 0.2. What is the probability that in a workday, at least one accident will occur when 150 employees use this machine?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring for one employee using the machine is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince there are 150 employees using the machine, the probability of no accidents occurring for all 150 employees is 0.8^150 ≈ 0.00000224.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one accident occurring by subtracting the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\n1 - 0.00000224 ≈ 0.99999776.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one accident will occur when 150 employees use the machine in a workday is approximately 0.99999776 or 99.999776%."
