    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector formed by an angle of 60 degrees, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the two radii.\n\nThe circumference of the entire circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius. In this case, r = 8 cm, so the circumference is C = 2π(8) = 16π cm.\n\nSince the sector is formed by an angle of 60 degrees, we need to find the fraction of the circle's circumference that corresponds to this angle. There are 360 degrees in a circle, so the fraction is (60/360) = 1/6.\n\nNow, we can find the arc length by multiplying the circumference by the fraction: Arc length = (1/6)(16π) = (16π)/6 = (8π)/3 cm.\n\nFinally, we add the two radii (each 8 cm) to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector: Perimeter = (8π)/3 + 8 + 8 = (8π)/3 + 16 cm."
