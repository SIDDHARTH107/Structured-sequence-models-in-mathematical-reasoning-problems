    "message_1": "An insurance company offers a car insurance policy with a monthly premium of $50. The policy covers expenses up to $10,000 in case of an accident. There are two types of drivers: safe drivers who have a 5% chance of getting into an accident and reckless drivers who have a 20% chance of getting into an accident. However, the insurance company is unable to distinguish between the safe and reckless drivers. What is the expected value of the insurance company's payout for each policy sold?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the insurance company's payout for each policy sold, we need to consider the probabilities of each type of driver getting into an accident and the respective payouts.\n\nLet's assume there are 100 drivers, with 50% being safe drivers and 50% being reckless drivers. So, there are 50 safe drivers and 50 reckless drivers.\n\nFor safe drivers:\nProbability of getting into an accident = 5% = 0.05\nNumber of safe drivers getting into an accident = 50 * 0.05 = 2.5 (we can't have half a driver, but this is an expected value)\nTotal payout for safe drivers = 2.5 * $10,000 = $25,000\n\nFor reckless drivers:\nProbability of getting into an accident = 20% = 0.20\nNumber of reckless drivers getting into an accident = 50 * 0.20 = 10\nTotal payout for reckless drivers = 10 * $10,000 = $100,000\n\nTotal payout for both types of drivers = $25,000 + $100,000 = $125,000\n\nSince there are 100 drivers in total, the expected value of the insurance company's payout for each policy sold is:\n\nExpected value = Total payout / Total number of drivers = $125,000 / 100 = $1,250"
