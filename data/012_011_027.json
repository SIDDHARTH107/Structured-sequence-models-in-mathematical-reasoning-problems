    "message_2": "A cut vertex (or articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo identify the cut vertices and bridges, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph and assign a discovery time and a low value to each vertex.\n2. The low value of a vertex is the smallest discovery time of any vertex reachable from it, including itself.\n3. A vertex is a cut vertex if it is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, or if it is not the root and has a child whose low value is greater than or equal to the discovery time of the vertex.\n4. An edge is a bridge if the low value of the destination vertex is greater than the discovery time of the source vertex.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. Perform DFS traversal and assign discovery time and low values:\n\n   Vertex | Discovery Time | Low Value\n   -------|----------------|----------\n   A      | 1              | 1\n   B      | 2              | 2\n   C      | 3              | 1\n   D      | 4              | 1\n   E      | 5              | 1\n   F      | 6              | 6\n   G      | 7              | 7\n   H      | 8              | 1\n   I      | 9              | 1\n\n2. Identify cut vertices:\n\n   - Vertex A: It is the root of the DFS tree and has two children (B and F), so it is a cut vertex.\n   - Vertex B: It has a child (C) with a low value (1) less than its discovery time (2), so it is not a cut vertex.\n   - Vertex F: It has a child (G) with a low value (7) greater than its discovery time (6), so it is a cut vertex.\n\n   Cut vertices: A, F\n\n3. Identify bridges:\n\n   - Edge (A, F): The low value of F (6) is greater than the discovery time of A (1), so it is a bridge.\n   - Edge (F, G): The low value of G (7) is greater than the discovery time of F (6), so it is a bridge.\n\n   Bridges: (A, F), (F, G)\n\nIn conclusion, the cut vertices in the graph are A and F, and the bridges are edges (A, F) and (F, G)."
