    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule which states that logₐ(x) - logₐ(y) = logₐ(x/y) and the product rule which states that logₐ(x) + logₐ(y) = logₐ(xy).\n\nApplying the quotient rule first:\n\nlog₂(8) - log₂(4) = log₂(8/4)\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\nlog₂(2)\n\nNow, applying the product rule:\n\nlog₂(2) + log₂(2) = log₂(2*2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the product:\n\nlog₂(4)\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\nlog₂(4)"
