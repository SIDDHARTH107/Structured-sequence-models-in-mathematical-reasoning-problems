    "message_2": "G and H are isomorphic. To show this, we can provide an isomorphism between them. An isomorphism is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) function f: V(G) -> V(H) such that if there is an edge between vertices u and v in G, then there is an edge between f(u) and f(v) in H, and vice versa.\n\nLet's define the function f as follows:\n\nf(1) = a\nf(2) = b\nf(3) = c\nf(4) = d\n\nNow, let's check if the edges in G correspond to the edges in H:\n\n1. Edge 12 in G corresponds to edge ab in H (f(1) = a, f(2) = b).\n2. Edge 23 in G corresponds to edge bc in H (f(2) = b, f(3) = c).\n3. Edge 34 in G corresponds to edge cd in H (f(3) = c, f(4) = d).\n4. Edge 14 in G corresponds to edge ad in H (f(1) = a, f(4) = d).\n\nSince all the edges in G correspond to the edges in H, G and H are isomorphic with the isomorphism f defined above."
