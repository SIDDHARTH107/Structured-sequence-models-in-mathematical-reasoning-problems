    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5} be two sets. Find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) ∪ B and (A ∪ B) ∆ B. Do they produce the same set? Prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union using this example.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5} (since 1 is in A but not in B, and 5 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow let's find (A ∆ B) ∪ B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ B = {1, 5} ∪ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNext, let's find A ∪ B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow let's find (A ∪ B) ∆ B:\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∆ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1} (since 1 is in A ∪ B but not in B)\n\nSo, (A ∆ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and (A ∪ B) ∆ B = {1}. They do not produce the same set.\n\nNow let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union using this example:\n\nWe want to show that (A ∆ B) ∪ B = (A ∪ B) ∆ B.\n\nHowever, as we have already found, (A ∆ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and (A ∪ B) ∆ B = {1}. Since these two sets are not equal, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over union in this example."
