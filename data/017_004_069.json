    "message_2": "We will use the Sylow theorems to solve this problem. Since the order of G is 25, which is a power of a prime number (5^2), we can apply the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, n_5 must divide the order of G, which is 25, and n_5 must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. \n\nIf n_5 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5. Since the order of H is 5, H is a cyclic group generated by some element a, i.e., H = ⟨a⟩. Now, since H is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G. \n\nLet K be another subgroup of G of order 5. Since the order of K is 5, K is a cyclic group generated by some element b, i.e., K = ⟨b⟩. Now, the product of the orders of H and K is 25, which is equal to the order of G. Since H and K are both normal subgroups of G, their intersection is trivial (i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G). Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are both cyclic groups of order 5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, each of order 5.\n\nIf n_5 = 25, then there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups of G. However, this would mean that there are 25 * 4 = 100 elements of order 5 in G, which is not possible since the order of G is only 25. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, each of order 5."
