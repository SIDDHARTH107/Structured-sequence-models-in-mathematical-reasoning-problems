    "message_1": "In a group of six people, what is the minimum number of handshakes that must occur for there to be either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers? How many handshakes will there be in total?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. We will first find the minimum number of handshakes needed to guarantee either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers.\n\nLet's consider one person in the group, say person A. Person A can shake hands with the other five people in the group. After shaking hands, there will be either at least three people who have shaken hands with person A (mutual friends) or at least three people who have not shaken hands with person A (mutual strangers).\n\nNow, let's consider the three people who are either mutual friends or mutual strangers with person A. If any one of these three people has shaken hands with any other person in this group of three, then we have a group of three mutual friends. If none of these three people have shaken hands with each other, then we have a group of three mutual strangers.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, we need a minimum of 5 handshakes (the handshakes involving person A) to guarantee either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of handshakes among the six people. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 6 to form a handshake, so n = 6 and k = 2:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 720 / (2 * 24) = 15\n\nSo, there will be a total of 15 handshakes among the six people."
