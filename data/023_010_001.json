    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Apply the Fourier transform to the grayscale image.\n2. Obtain the Fourier spectrum.\n3. Calculate the magnitude and phase values at the specific frequency component f = (50, 50).\n4. Round the magnitude and phase values to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I am unable to process images or perform numerical calculations directly. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the exact magnitude and phase values for the given image. \n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to perform these calculations using a programming language like Python and a library like NumPy.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to perform these steps using NumPy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Load the grayscale image (assuming it's named 'image256x256.png')\nimage = Image.open('image256x256.png').convert('L')\nimage_array = np.array(image)\n\n# Apply the Fourier transform to the image\nfourier_transform = np.fft.fft2(image_array)\n\n# Shift the zero-frequency component to the center of the spectrum\nfourier_spectrum = np.fft.fftshift(fourier_transform)\n\n# Calculate the magnitude and phase values at the specific frequency component f = (50, 50)\nmagnitude = np.abs(fourier_spectrum[50, 50])\nphase = np.angle(fourier_spectrum[50, 50])\n\n# Round the magnitude and phase values to the nearest hundredth\nmagnitude_rounded = round(magnitude, 2)\nphase_rounded = round(phase, 2)\n\nprint(\"Magnitude at f = (50, 50):\", magnitude_rounded)\nprint(\"Phase at f = (50, 50):\", phase_rounded)\n```\n\nReplace 'image256x256.png' with the filename of your grayscale image, and this code will calculate the magnitude and phase values at the specific frequency component f = (50, 50) in the Fourier spectrum."
