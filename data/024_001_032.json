    "message_1": "A space curve C is defined by the parametric equations:\nx= 3t + 4, y= 2t - 1, z= 5t^2 + 2t + 1\nDetermine the curvature and torsion of the curve at the point where t=2.",
    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to the parameter t.\n\nFirst derivatives:\ndx/dt = 3\ndy/dt = 2\ndz/dt = 10t + 2\n\nSecond derivatives:\nd²x/dt² = 0\nd²y/dt² = 0\nd²z/dt² = 10\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vector T(t) and its derivative dT/dt:\nT(t) = <dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt> = <3, 2, 10t + 2>\ndT/dt = <d²x/dt², d²y/dt², d²z/dt²> = <0, 0, 10>\n\nNext, we need to find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) at t = 2.\n\nCurvature (k) is given by the formula:\nk = ||dT/dt|| / ||T(t)||³\n\nAt t = 2, T(2) = <3, 2, 22> and dT/dt = <0, 0, 10>\n\n||T(2)|| = √(3² + 2² + 22²) = √537\n||dT/dt|| = √(0² + 0² + 10²) = 10\n\nk = 10 / (537)^(3/2) ≈ 0.0137\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ). Torsion is given by the formula:\nτ = (T(t) x dT/dt • d²T/dt²) / ||dT/dt||³\n\nFirst, we need to find the cross product of T(t) and dT/dt:\nT(t) x dT/dt = <(2)(10) - (0)(10t + 2), -(3)(10) - (0)(10), (3)(0) - (2)(0)>\nT(t) x dT/dt = <20, -30, 0>\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of (T(t) x dT/dt) and d²T/dt²:\n(T(t) x dT/dt) • d²T/dt² = (20)(0) + (-30)(0) + (0)(10) = 0\n\nτ = 0 / ||dT/dt||³ = 0 / (10³) = 0\n\nSo, the curvature (k) at t = 2 is approximately 0.0137, and the torsion (τ) is 0."
