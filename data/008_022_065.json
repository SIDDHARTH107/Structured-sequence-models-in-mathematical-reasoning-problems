    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 4  3  2 | 20 |\n| 6  2  1 | 15 |\n| 3  5  7 | 18 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 4 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n| 1  3/4  1/2 |  5  |\n| 6  2    1   | 15  |\n| 3  5    7   | 18  |\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nSubtract 6 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n| 1  3/4  1/2 |  5  |\n| 0 -1    -2  | -15 |\n| 3  5    7   | 18  |\n```\n\nSubtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  3/4  1/2 |  5  |\n| 0 -1    -2  | -15 |\n| 0  7/4  5/2 |  3  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by -1 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n| 1  3/4  1/2 |  5  |\n| 0  1    2   |  15 |\n| 0  7/4  5/2 |  3  |\n```\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\nSubtract 7/4 times the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  3/4  1/2 |  5  |\n| 0  1    2   |  15 |\n| 0  0   -3/2 | -21 |\n```\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -3/2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n| 1  3/4  1/2 |  5  |\n| 0  1    2   |  15 |\n| 0  0    1   |  14 |\n```\n\nNow we can use back substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = 14\n\ny = 15 - 2z = 15 - 2(14) = -13\n\nx = 5 - (3/4)y - (1/2)z = 5 - (3/4)(-13) - (1/2)(14) = 1\n\nSo the solution is x = 1, y = -13, and z = 14."
