    "message_1": "If in a workplace, the probability of a machine malfunctioning and causing an accident is 0.03, and there are 150 machines in the workplace, what is the probability of at least one machine malfunctioning and causing an accident?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of at least one machine malfunctioning is the probability of none of the machines malfunctioning.\n\nThe probability of a machine not malfunctioning is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nSince there are 150 machines, the probability of none of them malfunctioning is (0.97)^150 ≈ 0.0198.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one machine malfunctioning, we subtract the complementary probability from 1:\n\n1 - 0.0198 ≈ 0.9802.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one machine malfunctioning and causing an accident is approximately 0.9802 or 98.02%."
