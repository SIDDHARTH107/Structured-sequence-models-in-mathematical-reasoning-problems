    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 - 1), we first need to find the points where the denominator is zero, as these are the points where the function is not defined.\n\nThe denominator is z^2 - 1, which can be factored as (z - 1)(z + 1). Setting this equal to zero, we get two solutions:\n\nz - 1 = 0 => z = 1\nz + 1 = 0 => z = -1\n\nSo, the singularities of the function are at z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to determine the type of singularities. To do this, we can try to factor the numerator and see if any factors cancel out with the denominator.\n\nThe numerator is z^3 - 1, which can be factored using the difference of cubes formula:\n\nz^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)]/[(z - 1)(z + 1)]\n\nAt z = 1, we see that the factor (z - 1) cancels out:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + z + 1)/(z + 1)\n\nSince the function is now well-defined and analytic at z = 1, the singularity at z = 1 is a removable singularity.\n\nAt z = -1, the factors do not cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nf(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 - 1)\n\nTo determine the order of the pole at z = -1, we can find the limit of the function as z approaches -1:\n\nlim (z -> -1) [(z^3 - 1)/(z^2 - 1)] * (z + 1)\n\n= lim (z -> -1) [(z^3 - 1 + z^2 - 1)/(z^2 - 1)]\n\n= lim (z -> -1) [(z^3 + z^2 - 2)/(z^2 - 1)]\n\nSince the limit exists and is finite, the singularity at z = -1 is a pole of order 1 (simple pole).\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 - 1) has a removable singularity at z = 1 and a simple pole at z = -1. There are no essential singularities."
