    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a $4 \\times 4$ grid and you need to fill each cell with a number from 1 to 4 such that no number repeats in the same row or column. How many possible ways can you fill this Latin square?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of counting. We will fill the grid row by row and count the number of ways to fill each cell.\n\n1. For the first row, there are no restrictions, so we have 4! (4 factorial) ways to fill it. That is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\n2. For the second row, we have the following possibilities:\n   - 3 choices for the first cell (it cannot be the same as the number above it)\n   - 2 choices for the second cell (it cannot be the same as the number above it or the one we just placed)\n   - 1 choice for the third cell (it cannot be the same as the number above it or the ones we just placed)\n   - The fourth cell is determined by the remaining number.\n   So, there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to fill the second row.\n\n3. For the third row, we have the following possibilities:\n   - 2 choices for the first cell (it cannot be the same as the numbers above it)\n   - 1 choice for the second cell (it cannot be the same as the numbers above it or the one we just placed)\n   - 1 choice for the third cell (it cannot be the same as the numbers above it or the one we just placed)\n   - The fourth cell is determined by the remaining number.\n   So, there are 2 × 1 × 1 = 2 ways to fill the third row.\n\n4. For the fourth row, there is only one way to fill it since all the numbers in each column are already used.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to fill each row to get the total number of ways to fill the entire grid: 24 × 6 × 2 × 1 = 288 ways."
