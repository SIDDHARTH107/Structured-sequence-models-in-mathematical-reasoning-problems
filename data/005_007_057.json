    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student based on Correlation analysis:\n\nQ. A researcher wants to identify the relationship between the weight of a car and its fuel efficiency. She collects data on 10 cars' weights and their miles per gallon (MPG) and calculates the correlation coefficient between them to be -0.85. What does this correlation coefficient suggest about the relationship between weight and fuel efficiency? \n\n(Note: Assume that the weight of cars is measured in pounds and MPG is measured in miles per gallon.)",
    "message_2": "The correlation coefficient of -0.85 suggests a strong negative relationship between the weight of a car and its fuel efficiency. This means that as the weight of a car increases, its fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon) tends to decrease. Conversely, as the weight of a car decreases, its fuel efficiency tends to increase. The value of -0.85 indicates that this relationship is quite strong, but not perfectly negative (which would be -1)."
