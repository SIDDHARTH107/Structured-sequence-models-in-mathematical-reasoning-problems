    "message_2": "To partition a set containing 6 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), where n is the number of elements in the set and k is the number of non-empty subsets. In this case, n = 6 and k = 3.\n\nThe Stirling numbers of the second kind can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nwith the base cases:\n\nS(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0,\nS(0, 0) = 1,\nS(n, k) = 0 for k > n.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we can calculate S(6, 3) as follows:\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(3, 3) = 1 (since n = k)\nS(3, 2) = 3\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(4, 2) = 7\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 2) = 15\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\n\nSo there are 90 ways to partition a set containing 6 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets."
