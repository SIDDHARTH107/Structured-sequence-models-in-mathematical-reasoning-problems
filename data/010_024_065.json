    "message_2": "In the hyperbolic plane, the area of a triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, we have a triangle with angles 60, 70, and 50 degrees. First, we need to convert these angles to radians:\n\n60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n70 degrees = (70 * π) / 180 = 7π/18 radians\n50 degrees = (50 * π) / 180 = 5π/18 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem formula:\n\nArea = π - (π/3 + 7π/18 + 5π/18)\nArea = π - (6π/18 + 7π/18 + 5π/18)\nArea = π - (18π/18)\nArea = π - π\nArea = 0\n\nHowever, this result is not possible for a hyperbolic triangle, as it contradicts the fact that the sum of the angles in a hyperbolic triangle is always less than π. This means that a triangle with angles 60, 70, and 50 degrees cannot exist in the hyperbolic plane with curvature -1."
