    "message_2": "To prove that any group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must divide 25 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that n_5 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is unique, it is normal in G. The order of P is 5^2 = 25, so P is a subgroup of G of order 25. Since P is normal in G and has the same order as G, we have P = G.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of P. Since P is a p-group (a group of order p^n, where p is prime), we can apply the result that every p-group has a non-trivial center (i.e., a center with more than just the identity element). Let Z(P) be the center of P.\n\nThe order of Z(P) must be a divisor of the order of P, which is 25. Thus, the order of Z(P) can be either 1, 5, or 25. Since we know that Z(P) is non-trivial, the order of Z(P) cannot be 1. If the order of Z(P) is 25, then Z(P) = P, which implies that P is abelian and therefore cyclic. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 25.\n\nIf the order of Z(P) is 5, then Z(P) is a normal cyclic subgroup of P of order 5. Let a be a generator of Z(P), so Z(P) = ⟨a⟩. Since the order of P is 25, there exists an element b in P such that b is not in Z(P). We can now consider the subgroup H = ⟨b⟩. The order of H must be a divisor of the order of P, so the order of H can be either 1, 5, or 25. Since b is not in Z(P), the order of H cannot be 1. If the order of H is 25, then H = P, which contradicts the fact that b is not in Z(P). Thus, the order of H must be 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of elements from Z(P) and H. For any x in Z(P) and y in H, we have xy = yx since Z(P) is the center of P. Therefore, the set {xy | x in Z(P), y in H} is closed under the group operation. Moreover, this set contains 5 * 5 = 25 elements, which is the order of P. Thus, P = Z(P) × H.\n\nSince Z(P) and H are both cyclic groups of order 5, P is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
