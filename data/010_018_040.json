    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a Morse-Smale complex can be computed using the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index. In this case, we have:\n\n3 minima (index 0)\n2 saddles (index 1)\n3 maxima (index 2)\n\nThe Euler characteristic (χ) is given by:\n\nχ = (# of index 0) - (# of index 1) + (# of index 2)\n\nχ = 3 - 2 + 3\n\nχ = 4\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the given Morse-Smale complex is 4."
