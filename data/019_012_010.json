The truth values of these statements are as follows: P is true, Q is false, and R is true. Determine the truth value of the following statement:\n\n(P and Q) or (not P and R)\n\nSolution: \n\n(P and Q) is false since Q is false\n(not P and R) is true since P is false and R is true\nThus, (P and Q) or (not P and R) is true.",
