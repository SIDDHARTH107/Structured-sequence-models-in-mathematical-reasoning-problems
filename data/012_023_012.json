    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nIn the given graph G, we can observe the following cliques:\n\n1. {1,2,3} - This is a clique of size 3, as all three vertices are connected to each other.\n2. {2,4,5} - This is another clique of size 3, as all three vertices are connected to each other.\n\nThere are no cliques of size 4 or larger in the graph G. Therefore, the clique number of G is 3."
