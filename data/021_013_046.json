    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The production of each type of product requires certain quantities of raw material R1 and R2. The company has 150 units of R1 and 200 units of R2 available for production. Each unit of Product A generates a profit of $10 and each unit of Product B generates a profit of $20. Due to production constraints, the company can produce a maximum of 50 units of Product A and a maximum of 30 units of Product B. Use the simulated annealing method to find the production quantities of Product A and Product B that maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and initial solution.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 10 * A + 20 * B, where A is the number of units of Product A and B is the number of units of Product B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. A <= 50 (maximum of 50 units of Product A)\n2. B <= 30 (maximum of 30 units of Product B)\n3. R1 constraint: x * A + y * B <= 150 (where x and y are the units of R1 required for Product A and Product B, respectively)\n4. R2 constraint: p * A + q * B <= 200 (where p and q are the units of R2 required for Product A and Product B, respectively)\n\nInitial solution: Start with a random feasible solution, e.g., A = 25 and B = 10.\n\nNow, we can apply the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Set initial temperature T and cooling rate alpha.\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution by slightly changing the values of A and B.\n3. Calculate the change in profit (delta_P) between the current solution and the neighboring solution.\n4. If delta_P > 0, accept the neighboring solution as the new current solution.\n5. If delta_P < 0, accept the neighboring solution with probability exp(delta_P / T).\n6. Decrease the temperature by multiplying it with the cooling rate (T = alpha * T).\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the temperature is below a certain threshold or a maximum number of iterations have been reached.\n\nAfter the algorithm has finished, the current solution should be a good approximation of the optimal production quantities of Product A and Product B that maximize the profit.\n\nNote that the simulated annealing method is a heuristic algorithm, and the quality of the solution depends on the choice of parameters and the number of iterations. It is not guaranteed to find the exact optimal solution, but it can provide a good approximation in a reasonable amount of time."
