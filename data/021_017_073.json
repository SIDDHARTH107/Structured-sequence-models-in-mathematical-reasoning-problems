    "message_2": "Differential evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm that works by iteratively improving candidate solutions with respect to a given measure of quality. In this case, we want to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 12x + 5 within the interval [-5, 5].\n\nHere are the steps to apply differential evolution:\n\n1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions randomly within the interval [-5, 5].\n2. For each candidate solution, create a trial solution by combining it with other solutions in the population using mutation and crossover operations.\n3. Evaluate the trial solution using the function f(x).\n4. If the trial solution is better than the original candidate solution (i.e., has a higher value of f(x)), replace the original solution with the trial solution.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the maximum value of f(x) does not change significantly between iterations).\n\nHere's a simple implementation of differential evolution in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 2 * x**3 + 3 * x**2 - 12 * x + 5\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, max_iter):\n    pop = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=pop_size)\n    best_solution = pop[np.argmax([f(x) for x in pop])]\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            idxs = [idx for idx in range(pop_size) if idx != i]\n            a, b, c = pop[np.random.choice(idxs, 3, replace=False)]\n            mutant = a + 0.8 * (b - c)\n            mutant = np.clip(mutant, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n\n            if f(mutant) > f(pop[i]):\n                pop[i] = mutant\n\n        best_solution = pop[np.argmax([f(x) for x in pop])]\n\n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\npop_size = 50\nbounds = [-5, 5]\nmax_iter = 1000\n\nsolution, max_value = differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, max_iter)\nprint(\"Maximum value of f(x) =\", max_value, \"at x =\", solution)\n```\n\nThis code initializes a population of 50 candidate solutions and runs the differential evolution algorithm for 1000 iterations. The maximum value of f(x) and the corresponding x value are then printed. Note that the actual maximum value may vary slightly between runs due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm."
