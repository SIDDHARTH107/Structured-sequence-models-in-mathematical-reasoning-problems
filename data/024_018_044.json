    "message_1": "A student is calculating the sectional curvature of a surface defined by the equation z = xy + (x^2 + y^2)/4 at the point (1,1,3/4) in R^3. Using the Gaussian curvature formula K = (LnM - LnL)/(LnE), where L, M and E are the principal curvatures, and Ln denotes the natural logarithm, find the value of the sectional curvature at this point.",
    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's denote the surface as S(x, y) = (x, y, z(x, y)).\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nI = [[E, F],\n     [F, G]]\n\nwhere E = <S_x, S_x>, F = <S_x, S_y>, and G = <S_y, S_y>. Here, S_x and S_y are the partial derivatives of S with respect to x and y, respectively.\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nII = [[L, M],\n      [M, N]]\n\nwhere L = <S_xx, N(S_x)>, M = <S_xy, N(S_x)>, and N = <S_yy, N(S_x)>. Here, S_xx, S_xy, and S_yy are the second partial derivatives of S with respect to x and y, and N is the normal vector to the surface.\n\nNow, let's compute the necessary derivatives:\n\nS_x = (1, 0, x/2 + y)\nS_y = (0, 1, x + y/2)\n\nS_xx = (0, 0, 1/2)\nS_xy = (0, 0, 1)\nS_yy = (0, 0, 1/2)\n\nThe normal vector N can be computed as the cross product of S_x and S_y:\n\nN = S_x Ã— S_y = (-(x/2 + y), -(x + y/2), 1)\n\nNow, we can compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nE = <S_x, S_x> = (1 + (x/2 + y)^2)\nF = <S_x, S_y> = (x/2 + y)(x + y/2)\nG = <S_y, S_y> = (1 + (x + y/2)^2)\n\nL = <S_xx, N(S_x)> = 1/2\nM = <S_xy, N(S_x)> = 1\nN = <S_yy, N(S_x)> = 1/2\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 3/4), we have:\n\nE = 1 + (3/2)^2 = 13/4\nF = (3/2)(3/2) = 9/4\nG = 1 + (3/2)^2 = 13/4\n\nL = 1/2\nM = 1\nN = 1/2\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Gaussian curvature formula:\n\nK = ((1/2)(1/2) - 1^2) / ((13/4)(13/4) - (9/4)^2)\nK = (-1/2) / (169/16 - 81/16)\nK = (-1/2) / (88/16)\nK = (-1/2) * (16/88)\nK = -1/11\n\nSo, the sectional curvature at the point (1, 1, 3/4) is -1/11."
