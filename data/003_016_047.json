    "message_2": "To find the phase shift, we need to first understand the general equation for a sinusoidal function, which is:\n\ny(t) = A * sin(B(t - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nThe period of a sinusoidal function is related to the angular frequency by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nIn this case, the period is given as 6 seconds. We can find the angular frequency (B) using this formula:\n\n6 = 2π / B\nB = 2π / 6\nB = π / 3\n\nNow, we know that at t = 3 seconds, the car is at its maximum (peak). This means that the sinusoidal function should have a value of 1 at t = 3 seconds. Since the car is at its maximum, the vertical shift (D) is 0. Therefore, we have:\n\n1 = A * sin(B(3 - C))\n\nWe don't know the amplitude (A), but we know that it's not 0, otherwise the car wouldn't move. So, we can divide both sides by A:\n\n1/A = sin(π/3 * (3 - C))\n\nSince the maximum value of the sine function is 1, we must have:\n\n1/A = 1\n\nNow, we know that the sine function has a maximum value when its argument is an odd multiple of π/2:\n\nπ/3 * (3 - C) = (2n + 1) * π/2, where n is an integer\n\nNow, we can solve for the phase shift (C):\n\n(3 - C) = (2n + 1) * 3/2\n3 - C = 3(2n + 1)/2\nC = 3 - 3(2n + 1)/2\n\nSince the phase shift is unique up to a multiple of the period, we can choose the smallest non-negative value for n, which is n = 0:\n\nC = 3 - 3(2*0 + 1)/2\nC = 3 - 3/2\nC = 3/2\n\nSo, the phase shift is 3/2 seconds."
