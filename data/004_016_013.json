    "message_2": "To use the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to find the average speed of the car during the entire trip. The car travels at 60 mph for the first hour and 40 mph for the second hour. \n\nThe total distance traveled during the first hour is 60 miles (60 mph * 1 hour), and the total distance traveled during the second hour is 40 miles (40 mph * 1 hour). So, the total distance traveled during the trip is 60 + 40 = 100 miles.\n\nThe total time taken for the trip is 1 hour (first hour) + 1 hour (second hour) = 2 hours.\n\nNow, we can find the average speed of the car during the entire trip:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 100 miles / 2 hours\nAverage speed = 50 mph\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there must be at least one point during the trip when the car was traveling at the average speed of 50 mph. To find this point, we need to analyze the car's speed during the trip.\n\nDuring the first hour, the car is traveling at 60 mph, which is already greater than the average speed of 50 mph. Therefore, the car must have been traveling at 50 mph at some point during the transition from 60 mph to 40 mph.\n\nSince we don't have a specific function for the car's speed during the trip, we cannot determine the exact time at which the car was traveling at 50 mph. However, we can conclude that there was at least one point during the trip when the car was traveling at an average speed of 50 mph, as guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem."
