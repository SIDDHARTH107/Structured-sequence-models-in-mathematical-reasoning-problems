    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of the performances will involve magic tricks, we can find the probability that none of them involve magic tricks and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are 10 solo performances, and 5 of them do not involve magic tricks. So, the probability that the first chosen performance does not involve magic tricks is 5/10.\n\nAfter choosing one non-magic performance, there are now 9 performances left, 4 of which do not involve magic tricks. So, the probability that the second chosen performance does not involve magic tricks is 4/9.\n\nFinally, after choosing two non-magic performances, there are 8 performances left, 3 of which do not involve magic tricks. So, the probability that the third chosen performance does not involve magic tricks is 3/8.\n\nThe probability that all three chosen performances do not involve magic tricks is the product of these probabilities:\n\n(5/10) * (4/9) * (3/8) = 60/720 = 1/12\n\nNow, we'll subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one of the chosen performances involves magic tricks:\n\n1 - (1/12) = 11/12\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the three chosen solo performances involves magic tricks is 11/12."
