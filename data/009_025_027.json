    "message_2": "We will use the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to determine the price of the call option. The formula is given by:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = price of the call option\nS = current stock price\nX = strike price\nr = risk-free interest rate\nT = time to expiration\nN(d) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nσ = market volatility\n\nGiven the parameters:\nS = $100\nX = $110\nT = 1 year\nr = 5% = 0.05\nσ = 20% = 0.20\n\nFirst, we calculate d1 and d2:\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + (0.20^2)/2) * 1) / (0.20 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = -0.1315\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.20 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = -0.3315\n\nNext, we find the values of N(d1) and N(d2) using the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution:\nN(d1) = 0.4475\nN(d2) = 0.3700\n\nFinally, we calculate the price of the call option:\nC = 100 * 0.4475 - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 1) * 0.3700\nC = 44.75 - 104.54 * 0.9512 * 0.3700\nC = 44.75 - 36.59\n\nC = $8.16\n\nTherefore, the price of the European call option is $8.16."
