    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations with noisy data:\n\n$2x_1 + 4x_2 - 6x_3 = 10.5$\n$3x_1 + 6.1x_2 - 9.2x_3 = 15.8$\n$4x_1 + 7.9x_2 - 12.1x_3 = 20.3$\n\nFind the values of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting method to solve the system of equations.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 4 & -6 & 10.5 \\\\\n3 & 6.1 & -9.2 & 15.8 \\\\\n4 & 7.9 & -12.1 & 20.3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. \n\nStep 1: Find the pivot element in the first column. The pivot element is the element with the largest absolute value in the first column, which is 4. So, we will swap the first and third rows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 7.9 & -12.1 & 20.3 \\\\\n3 & 6.1 & -9.2 & 15.8 \\\\\n2 & 4 & -6 & 10.5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the elements below the pivot element in the first column. To do this, we will subtract the appropriate multiples of the first row from the second and third rows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 7.9 & -12.1 & 20.3 \\\\\n0 & 0.725 & -1.775 & 2.075 \\\\\n0 & 0.025 & 0.025 & -0.075\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Find the pivot element in the second column. The pivot element is the element with the largest absolute value in the second column, which is 0.725. So, we will swap the second and third rows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 7.9 & -12.1 & 20.3 \\\\\n0 & 0.025 & 0.025 & -0.075 \\\\\n0 & 0.725 & -1.775 & 2.075\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the elements below the pivot element in the second column. To do this, we will subtract the appropriate multiple of the second row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 7.9 & -12.1 & 20.3 \\\\\n0 & 0.025 & 0.025 & -0.075 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1.5 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can perform back substitution to find the values of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.\n\nStep 5: Solve for $x_3$:\n\n$$\n-1.5x_3 = 2 \\Rightarrow x_3 = -\\frac{4}{3}\n$$\n\nStep 6: Solve for $x_2$:\n\n$$\n0.025x_2 + 0.025x_3 = -0.075 \\Rightarrow x_2 = -\\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nStep 7: Solve for $x_1$:\n\n$$\n4x_1 + 7.9x_2 - 12.1x_3 = 20.3 \\Rightarrow x_1 = 2\n$$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is $x_1 = 2$, $x_2 = -\\frac{1}{3}$, and $x_3 = -\\frac{4}{3}$."
