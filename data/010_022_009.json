    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular faces (top and bottom) and the lateral surface area (the curved part around the cylinder).\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius of the cylinder is 5 cm, we can find the area of one circular face:\n\nA = π(5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nSince there are two circular faces (top and bottom), we need to multiply this area by 2:\n\n2 * 25π cm² = 50π cm²\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. We are given the radius (5 cm) and the height (15 cm), so we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nA = 2π(5 cm)(15 cm) = 150π cm²\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area by adding the areas of the two circular faces and the lateral surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 50π cm² + 150π cm² = 200π cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is 200π cm²."
