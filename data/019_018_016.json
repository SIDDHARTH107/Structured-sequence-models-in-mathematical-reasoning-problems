    "message_2": "Let's consider three consecutive odd numbers. We can represent the first odd number as 2n + 1, where n is an integer. Since odd numbers are 2 units apart, the next two consecutive odd numbers can be represented as (2n + 3) and (2n + 5).\n\nNow, let's find the sum of these three consecutive odd numbers:\n\n(2n + 1) + (2n + 3) + (2n + 5)\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\n6n + 9\n\nFactor out the common factor, which is 3:\n\n3(2n + 3)\n\nThe expression 3(2n + 3) is a multiple of 3, as it is the product of 3 and the expression (2n + 3), where n is an integer. Therefore, the sum of three consecutive odd numbers is always a multiple of three."
