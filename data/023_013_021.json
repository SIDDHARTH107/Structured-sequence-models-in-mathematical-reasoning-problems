    "message_1": "A thin metal rod with length L=0.5 meters and cross-sectional area A=0.01 m^2 is heated on one end to a temperature of 100°C and kept insulated on the other end. The initial temperature of the rod is 20°C. If the thermal conductivity of the rod is k=50 W/(mK), calculate the temperature distribution along the rod at t=10 seconds using the Fourier transform method.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the Fourier transform method. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity. The thermal diffusivity can be calculated using the formula:\n\nα = k/(ρc)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density of the material, and c is the specific heat capacity. For this problem, we are not given the values of ρ and c, so we will assume that the thermal diffusivity α is constant.\n\nThe boundary conditions for this problem are:\n\n1. T(0, t) = 100°C (heated end)\n2. ∂T/∂x (L, t) = 0 (insulated end)\n\nThe initial condition is:\n\nT(x, 0) = 20°C\n\nNow we will use the Fourier transform method to solve the heat equation. We will use the Fourier sine series to represent the temperature distribution along the rod:\n\nT(x, t) = A0(t) + Σ[An(t) * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere A0(t) and An(t) are the time-dependent Fourier coefficients. The initial condition gives us:\n\n20 = A0(0) + Σ[An(0) * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nSince the initial condition is a constant, all the An(0) coefficients are zero, and A0(0) = 20.\n\nNext, we will find the time-dependent Fourier coefficients by substituting the Fourier sine series into the heat equation and applying the boundary conditions. This gives us:\n\n∂A0/∂t = α * (n²π²/L²) * An\n\nwith the boundary conditions:\n\nA0(t) = 100\n∂An/∂x (L, t) = 0\n\nNow we can solve the differential equation for An(t):\n\nAn(t) = (100 - 20) * (1 - exp(-α * (n²π²/L²) * t)) / (n²π²/L²)\n\nFinally, we can substitute the An(t) coefficients back into the Fourier sine series to find the temperature distribution along the rod at t = 10 seconds:\n\nT(x, 10) = 100 - Σ[((100 - 20) * (1 - exp(-α * (n²π²/L²) * 10)) / (n²π²/L²)) * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nTo calculate the temperature distribution numerically, we can sum the first few terms of the series (e.g., the first 100 terms). Note that the convergence of the series may be slow, so more terms may be needed for an accurate result."
