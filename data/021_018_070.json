    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Solving optimization problems using tabu search:\n\nConsider the following optimization problem:\n\nMaximize f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1, where x is a real number.\n\nUsing tabu search algorithm with 50 iterations and a tabu list of length 5, find the maximum value of the objective function f(x) and the corresponding value of x. Start the search with a random initial solution between -5 and 5.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the tabu search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate a random initial solution x0 between -5 and 5.\n2. Set the best solution found so far to x0.\n3. Create an empty tabu list of length 5.\n4. For each iteration (1 to 50), do the following:\n   a. Generate a set of neighboring solutions for the current solution.\n   b. Evaluate the objective function f(x) for each neighboring solution.\n   c. Select the best non-tabu solution from the neighbors.\n   d. If the selected solution is better than the best solution found so far, update the best solution.\n   e. Add the selected solution to the tabu list and remove the oldest solution if the tabu list is full.\n5. Return the best solution found and its corresponding objective function value.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute code or generate random numbers. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific numerical solution using the tabu search algorithm. I recommend implementing the algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB to obtain a numerical solution for this problem."
