    "message_1": "What is the probability that in a country with a population of 10 million people, at least 100,000 people will vote for a certain political candidate who has a 5% chance of winning the election?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the population of 10 million people)\n- k is the number of successful trials (in this case, the number of people voting for the candidate)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the 5% chance of winning the election)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability that at least 100,000 people will vote for the candidate, so we need to calculate the cumulative probability for k = 100,000 to k = 10,000,000.\n\nP(X ≥ 100,000) = 1 - P(X < 100,000)\n\nCalculating the cumulative probability for such a large range of values is computationally intensive and may not be practical. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability.\n\nFor a binomial distribution, the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) can be calculated as follows:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nIn this case:\n\nμ = 10,000,000 * 0.05 = 500,000\nσ = sqrt(10,000,000 * 0.05 * 0.95) ≈ 2169.27\n\nNow, we can standardize the value of 100,000 using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nz = (100,000 - 500,000) / 2169.27 ≈ -184.08\n\nSince the z-score is so far from the mean, the probability of having at least 100,000 people voting for the candidate is extremely close to 1 (almost certain). This is because the candidate's expected number of votes is 500,000, which is much higher than the 100,000 threshold."
