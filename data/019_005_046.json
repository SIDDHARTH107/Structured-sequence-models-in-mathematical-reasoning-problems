    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student based on epistemic logic:\n\nThere are three mathematicians, Alex, Ben, and Chris, who are each wearing a black or white hat. They know that at least one of them is wearing a black hat, but none of them know their own hat color. They are not allowed to communicate with each other in any way. After some time, Alex realizes that he is wearing a black hat. How did he come to this conclusion?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. Since all three mathematicians know that at least one of them is wearing a black hat, if both Ben and Chris were wearing white hats, Alex would immediately know that he must be wearing a black hat. However, Alex doesn't immediately know his hat color, so there must be at least one black hat among Ben and Chris.\n\n2. Now, Ben also knows that if Chris were wearing a white hat, Alex would have been able to deduce his own hat color (black) based on the information in step 1. Since Alex didn't immediately know his hat color, Ben can conclude that Chris must be wearing a black hat.\n\n3. Chris, being a mathematician, understands the thought process of both Alex and Ben. He knows that if Ben saw him (Chris) wearing a white hat, Ben would have been able to deduce his own hat color (black) based on the information in step 2. However, Ben doesn't immediately know his hat color either.\n\n4. Since Ben didn't immediately know his hat color, Chris can conclude that Ben must also be seeing a black hat on Chris's head. Therefore, both Ben and Chris are wearing black hats.\n\n5. Finally, Alex observes that neither Ben nor Chris immediately knew their hat color. This means that both of them must have seen a black hat on the other person's head. Since Alex knows that at least one of them is wearing a black hat, and both Ben and Chris are wearing black hats, he can deduce that he is also wearing a black hat."
