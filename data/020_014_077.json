    "message_1": "The problem is:\n\nA company produces two products, X and Y. The profits per unit of X and Y are $5 and $7, respectively. The production process requires two resources, A and B. Each unit of X requires 3 units of A and 4 units of B, while each unit of Y requires 6 units of A and 2 units of B. The company can use at most 300 units of A and 200 units of B. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of X and Y to produce, given the constraints on resources A and B. Let's use x to represent the number of units of product X and y to represent the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe profit function P(x, y) can be represented as:\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nThe constraints on resources A and B can be represented as:\n3x + 6y ≤ 300 (resource A constraint)\n4x + 2y ≤ 200 (resource B constraint)\n\nWe can simplify the constraints by dividing the resource A constraint by 3 and the resource B constraint by 2:\nx + 2y ≤ 100\n2x + y ≤ 100\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies both constraints. Since x and y cannot be negative (we cannot produce a negative number of units), we have two more constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region can be found by graphing the constraints and finding the intersection points. The intersection points are (0, 0), (0, 50), (50, 0), and (20, 40).\n\nNow, we need to find the profit at each of these intersection points:\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\nP(0, 50) = 5(0) + 7(50) = $350\nP(50, 0) = 5(50) + 7(0) = $250\nP(20, 40) = 5(20) + 7(40) = $100 + $280 = $380\n\nThe maximum profit of $380 is achieved when the company produces 20 units of product X and 40 units of product Y."
