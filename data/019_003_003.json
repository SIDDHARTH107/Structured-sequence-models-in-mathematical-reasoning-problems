    "message_2": "In modal logic, \"necessarily\" means that the statement is true in all possible worlds. To determine if the statement \"Necessarily, there exist infinitely many primes that are odd\" is true or false, we need to examine the properties of prime numbers and odd numbers.\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. An odd number is an integer that is not divisible by 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the prime numbers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ... . Notice that all prime numbers except for 2 are odd. This is because any even number greater than 2 has 2 as a divisor, which means it cannot be prime.\n\nThe statement we are trying to prove is that there exist infinitely many primes that are odd. This statement is equivalent to the statement that there exist infinitely many prime numbers, since all prime numbers except for 2 are odd.\n\nThe infinitude of prime numbers was proven by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid around 300 BCE. In his proof, Euclid showed that for any finite list of prime numbers, there exists a prime number that is not in the list. This implies that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nSince there are infinitely many prime numbers, and all prime numbers except for 2 are odd, it follows that there are necessarily infinitely many primes that are odd. Therefore, the statement \"Necessarily, there exist infinitely many primes that are odd\" is true."
