    "message_1": "Suppose a forced van der Pol oscillator is described by the following differential equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \\mu \\left(x^2 - 1\\right) \\frac{dx}{dt} + x = A \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $\\mu = 0.5$, $A = 1.5$, $\\omega = 0.75$, $x(0) = 2$, $\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 0$. \n\nFind the solution $x(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 50]$.",
    "message_2": "To find the solution $x(t)$ for the given forced van der Pol oscillator, we can use numerical methods like the Runge-Kutta method to solve the second-order differential equation. First, we can rewrite the given second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\nLet $y_1 = x$ and $y_2 = \\frac{dx}{dt}$. Then, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{dy_1}{dt} = y_2$$\n$$\\frac{dy_2}{dt} = A \\cos(\\omega t) - y_1 - \\mu (y_1^2 - 1) y_2$$\n\nNow, we can use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of first-order differential equations. The method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Define the functions $f_1(t, y_1, y_2) = y_2$ and $f_2(t, y_1, y_2) = A \\cos(\\omega t) - y_1 - \\mu (y_1^2 - 1) y_2$.\n2. Choose a step size $h$ and the range of $t$ values, in this case, $t \\in [0, 50]$.\n3. Initialize the initial conditions $y_1(0) = x(0) = 2$ and $y_2(0) = \\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 0$.\n4. Iterate through the following steps for each $t_i$ in the range of $t$ values:\n\n  a. Calculate $k_1 = h * f_1(t_i, y_1, y_2)$ and $l_1 = h * f_2(t_i, y_1, y_2)$.\n  b. Calculate $k_2 = h * f_1(t_i + \\frac{h}{2}, y_1 + \\frac{k_1}{2}, y_2 + \\frac{l_1}{2})$ and $l_2 = h * f_2(t_i + \\frac{h}{2}, y_1 + \\frac{k_1}{2}, y_2 + \\frac{l_1}{2})$.\n  c. Calculate $k_3 = h * f_1(t_i + \\frac{h}{2}, y_1 + \\frac{k_2}{2}, y_2 + \\frac{l_2}{2})$ and $l_3 = h * f_2(t_i + \\frac{h}{2}, y_1 + \\frac{k_2}{2}, y_2 + \\frac{l_2}{2})$.\n  d. Calculate $k_4 = h * f_1(t_i + h, y_1 + k_3, y_2 + l_3)$ and $l_4 = h * f_2(t_i + h, y_1 + k_3, y_2 + l_3)$.\n  e. Update the values of $y_1$ and $y_2$ as follows: $y_1 = y_1 + \\frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)$ and $y_2 = y_2 + \\frac{1}{6}(l_1 + 2l_2 + 2l_3 + l_4)$.\n\nAfter iterating through all the $t_i$ values, we will have the numerical solution for $x(t) = y_1(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 50]$. Note that the accuracy of the solution depends on the chosen step size $h$. A smaller step size will generally result in a more accurate solution but will require more computational effort."
