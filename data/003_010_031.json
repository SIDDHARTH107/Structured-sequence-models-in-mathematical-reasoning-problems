    "message_1": "A flagpole casts a shadow of 12 meters when the angle of elevation of the sun is 45 degrees. What is the height of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the shadow (adjacent side) is 12 meters long.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45Â°) = height / 12\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 12\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the flagpole:\n\nheight = 12 * 1\n\nheight = 12 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is 12 meters."
