    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2  3  2 | 14 ]\n[ 3  2  4 | 18 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  2 ]\n[ 0 -1  1 |  0 ]\n```\n\n2. Add the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  2 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. From the third row, we have z = 2.\n2. From the second row, we have y = 2.\n3. From the first row, we have x + y + z = 6, so x = 6 - y - z = 6 - 2 - 2 = 2.\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 2, and z = 2."
