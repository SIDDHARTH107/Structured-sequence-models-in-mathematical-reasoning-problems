    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (also known as the circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven a diameter of 10 cm, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = π * 10\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 10\nC ≈ 31.4159 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 31.4159 cm."
