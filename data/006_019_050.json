    "message_1": "What is the probability that a randomly chosen citizen of a country will support a particular political party in the upcoming elections, given that the party has a historical success rate of 60% in winning elections in the past?",
    "message_2": "The historical success rate of a political party winning elections does not directly provide information about the probability of a randomly chosen citizen supporting that party. To determine the probability of a citizen supporting the party, we would need additional information, such as polling data or surveys that show the percentage of citizens who support the party. Without this information, we cannot accurately determine the probability of a randomly chosen citizen supporting the party in the upcoming elections."
