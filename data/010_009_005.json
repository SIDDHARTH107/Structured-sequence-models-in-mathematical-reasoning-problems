    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Euler characteristic formula for a connected surface:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere χ is the Euler characteristic, V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (triangles in this case).\n\nFor a closed connected surface with genus g, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nNow, let's consider a triangulation of the surface. In this triangulation, each triangle has 3 edges and 3 vertices. However, since each edge is shared by two triangles, we need to divide the total number of edges by 2 when counting them. Therefore, we have:\n\nV = 3F/2\nE = 3F/2\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the Euler characteristic formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n2 - 2g = (3F/2) - (3F/2) + F\n2 - 2g = F\n\nSo, the number of triangles needed in a triangulation that subdivides the surface into smaller triangles is:\n\nF = 2 - 2g"
