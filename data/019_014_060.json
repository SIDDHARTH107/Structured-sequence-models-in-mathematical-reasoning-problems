    "message_2": "To determine whether the statement ∀ x. P(x) → P(x+1) is true or false, let's analyze the given statement.\n\nP(x) is the statement \"x+2 > 5\". If P(x) is true, then x+2 > 5.\n\nNow, let's consider P(x+1). This statement is \"(x+1) + 2 > 5\", which simplifies to \"x+3 > 5\".\n\nWe want to show that if P(x) is true, then P(x+1) is also true. \n\nAssume P(x) is true, so x+2 > 5. We want to show that x+3 > 5.\n\nSince x+2 > 5, adding 1 to both sides of the inequality gives us:\n\nx+2+1 > 5+1\nx+3 > 6\n\nSince 6 > 5, we can conclude that x+3 > 5, which means P(x+1) is true.\n\nThus, the statement ∀ x. P(x) → P(x+1) is true for all natural numbers x."
