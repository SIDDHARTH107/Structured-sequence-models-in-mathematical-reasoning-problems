    "message_1": "In a survey conducted in a certain country, it was found that 40% of the adults are registered voters. If a random sample of 500 adults is taken from the population, what is the probability that at least 200 of them are registered voters?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k registered voters in the sample\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of an adult being a registered voter (40% or 0.4)\n- n is the sample size (500)\n- k is the number of registered voters we are interested in\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 200 of the 500 adults are registered voters, we need to calculate the probability for each value of k from 200 to 500 and sum them up.\n\nP(X >= 200) = P(X = 200) + P(X = 201) + ... + P(X = 500)\n\nCalculating this by hand would be very tedious, so we can use a statistical software or calculator to find the cumulative binomial probability.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nP(X >= 200) â‰ˆ 0.999\n\nSo, the probability that at least 200 of the 500 adults in the sample are registered voters is approximately 0.999 or 99.9%."
