    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of a matrix. Here's the step-by-step process for the given matrix A and initial guess [1; 1]:\n\nMatrix A:\n[1, 2;\n 2, 4]\n\nInitial guess (x0):\n[1;\n 1]\n\n1. Multiply A by the initial guess (x0):\n\nAx0 = [1*1 + 2*1; 2*1 + 4*1] = [3; 6]\n\n2. Normalize the resulting vector:\n\n||Ax0|| = sqrt(3^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(45)\n\nNormalized Ax0 (x1) = [3/sqrt(45); 6/sqrt(45)] = [1/sqrt(5); 2/sqrt(5)]\n\n3. Multiply A by the new vector (x1):\n\nAx1 = [1*(1/sqrt(5)) + 2*(2/sqrt(5)); 2*(1/sqrt(5)) + 4*(2/sqrt(5))] = [5/sqrt(5); 10/sqrt(5)]\n\n4. Normalize the resulting vector:\n\n||Ax1|| = sqrt((5/sqrt(5))^2 + (10/sqrt(5))^2) = sqrt(25)\n\nNormalized Ax1 (x2) = [5/sqrt(25); 10/sqrt(25)] = [1/5; 2/5]\n\nAt this point, the eigenvector is not changing significantly, so we can stop the iteration process. To find the dominant eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue (位) = (x2^T * A * x2) / (x2^T * x2)\n\n位 = ([1/5, 2/5] * [1, 2; 2, 4] * [1/5; 2/5]) / ([1/5, 2/5] * [1/5; 2/5])\n\n位 = (1/25 + 8/25) / (1/25 + 4/25) = 9/5\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is 位 = 9/5, and its corresponding eigenvector is approximately [1/5; 2/5]."
