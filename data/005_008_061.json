    "message_2": "To find the average monthly rainfall over the past 10 years, we first need to find the total rainfall for all 10 years and then divide by the total number of months in 10 years (120 months).\n\nTotal rainfall = 85 + 78 + 92 + 67 + 73 + 95 + 80 + 87 + 79 + 82 = 818 mm\n\nNow, we divide the total rainfall by the total number of months:\n\nAverage monthly rainfall = 818 mm / 120 months = 6.8167 mm (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nSo, the average monthly rainfall in the city over the past 10 years is approximately 6.8167 mm."
