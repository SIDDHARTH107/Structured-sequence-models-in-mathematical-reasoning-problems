A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, the cut vertices are:\n- Vertex 1: If we remove vertex 1, the graph will be split into two connected components: {2, 3, 4, 5} and {6, 7, 8, 9}.\n- Vertex 4: If we remove vertex 4, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3} and {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nThe bridges in the graph are:\n- Edge (1, 4): If we remove this edge, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n- Edge (4, 5): If we remove this edge, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}."
