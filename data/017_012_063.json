    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 16, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. A group of order 16 must have a prime power order, since 16 = 2^4.\n3. By the Sylow theorems, a group of order 16 must have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of groups of order 16:\n\n1. Cyclic group: There is only one cyclic group of order 16, which is denoted by C_16 or Z_16.\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: There are two possibilities here: C_4 × C_4 and C_2 × C_8. Both of these groups are abelian.\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: There is only one possibility here: C_2 × C_2 × C_4. This group is also abelian.\n4. Semidirect product of two cyclic groups: There are two possibilities here: C_4 ⋊ C_4 and C_8 ⋊ C_2. Both of these groups are non-abelian.\n5. Semidirect product of three cyclic groups: There is only one possibility here: C_2 × (C_2 ⋊ C_4). This group is non-abelian.\n\nIn total, there are 5 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 16."
