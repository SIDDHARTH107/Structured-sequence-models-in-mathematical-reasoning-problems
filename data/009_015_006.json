At the beginning of an experiment, there are 500 grams of the substance. \n\na) Write a differential equation that models the decay of the substance over time.\n\nb) Find the amount of substance remaining after 30 days.\n\nc) How long will it take for the substance to decay to 100 grams?",
    "message_2": "a) To write a differential equation that models the decay of the substance over time, we can use the following formula:\n\ndP/dt = -kP\n\nwhere P is the amount of the substance, t is the time in days, and k is the decay constant. Since we know the half-life of the substance is 10 days, we can find the decay constant using the formula:\n\nhalf-life = ln(2) / k\n\nPlugging in the given half-life:\n\n10 = ln(2) / k\n\nSolving for k:\n\nk = ln(2) / 10 ≈ 0.0693\n\nSo, the differential equation that models the decay of the substance over time is:\n\ndP/dt = -0.0693P\n\nb) To find the amount of substance remaining after 30 days, we can use the formula:\n\nP(t) = P₀ * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere P₀ is the initial amount of the substance (500 grams) and t is the time in days (30 days). Plugging in the values:\n\nP(30) = 500 * e^(-0.0693 * 30)\n\nP(30) ≈ 500 * e^(-2.079) ≈ 500 * 0.125 ≈ 62.5 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, there will be approximately 62.5 grams of the substance remaining.\n\nc) To find how long it will take for the substance to decay to 100 grams, we can use the same formula as in part b) and solve for t:\n\n100 = 500 * e^(-0.0693t)\n\nDivide both sides by 500:\n\n0.2 = e^(-0.0693t)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.2) = -0.0693t\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = ln(0.2) / -0.0693 ≈ 15.47 days\n\nSo, it will take approximately 15.47 days for the substance to decay to 100 grams."
