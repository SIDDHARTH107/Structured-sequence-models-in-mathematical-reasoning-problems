Assuming the factory produces 500 new bulbs every week, how many working bulbs will the factory have at the beginning of week 12? Use recurrence relations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's define a recurrence relation for the number of working bulbs at the beginning of each week. Let B(n) be the number of working bulbs at the beginning of week n. We are given that B(1) = 2000 and that the factory produces 500 new bulbs every week.\n\nAt the beginning of each week, the factory will have the number of working bulbs from the previous week, minus the bulbs that have reached the end of their 5-week lifespan, plus the 500 new bulbs produced that week. Therefore, we can define the recurrence relation as:\n\nB(n) = B(n-1) - B(n-5) + 500, for n > 1\n\nNow, we can use this recurrence relation to find the number of working bulbs at the beginning of week 12.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of working bulbs for weeks 2 through 6:\n\nB(2) = B(1) - B(-3) + 500 = 2000 - 0 + 500 = 2500 (since there are no bulbs with negative lifespan)\nB(3) = B(2) - B(-2) + 500 = 2500 - 0 + 500 = 3000\nB(4) = B(3) - B(-1) + 500 = 3000 - 0 + 500 = 3500\nB(5) = B(4) - B(0) + 500 = 3500 - 0 + 500 = 4000\nB(6) = B(5) - B(1) + 500 = 4000 - 2000 + 500 = 2500\n\nNow we can find the number of working bulbs for weeks 7 through 11:\n\nB(7) = B(6) - B(2) + 500 = 2500 - 2500 + 500 = 500\nB(8) = B(7) - B(3) + 500 = 500 - 3000 + 500 = 0 (since there cannot be negative working bulbs, we set it to 0)\nB(9) = B(8) - B(4) + 500 = 0 - 3500 + 500 = 0\nB(10) = B(9) - B(5) + 500 = 0 - 4000 + 500 = 0\nB(11) = B(10) - B(6) + 500 = 0 - 2500 + 500 = 0\n\nFinally, we can find the number of working bulbs at the beginning of week 12:\n\nB(12) = B(11) - B(7) + 500 = 0 - 500 + 500 = 0\n\nSo, at the beginning of week 12, the factory will have 0 working bulbs."
