    "message_1": "Given the following weighted undirected graph, what is the minimum cost spanning tree? \n\n```\n   2    3\na------b\n|\\3  /|\\\n|  / | \\4\n|/   1  \\\nc------d\n   5\n```\n\nNote: The numbers on the edges represent the weight or cost of that edge. The minimum cost spanning tree is the tree that spans all the vertices and has the lowest possible total edge weight.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost spanning tree, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order. Then, we add the edges to the spanning tree one by one, ensuring that adding the edge doesn't create a cycle. We continue this process until all vertices are connected.\n\nSorted edges by weight:\n1. c-d (1)\n2. a-b (2)\n3. a-c (3)\n4. b-d (3)\n5. b-c (4)\n6. c-d (5)\n\nNow, we add the edges one by one:\n1. Add c-d (1)\n2. Add a-b (2)\n3. Add a-c (3) - At this point, all vertices are connected, and adding any more edges would create a cycle.\n\nThe minimum cost spanning tree is:\n\n```\n   2\na------b\n|\\\n|  \\\n|   \\\nc------d\n   1\n```\n\nThe total cost of this spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6."
