    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that allows us to isolate x. Since 8 can be written as a power of 2 (8 = 2^3), we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n2^(3x-2) = 2^3\n\nNow, since the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n3x - 2 = 3\n\nNext, we'll isolate x by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n3x = 5\n\nFinally, we'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\nx = 5/3"
