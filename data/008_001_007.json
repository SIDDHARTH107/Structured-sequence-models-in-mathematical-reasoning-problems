    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the augmented matrix and then perform Gaussian elimination to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 | 7 |\n| 2  3  1 | 4 |\n| 3  1  1 | 6 |\n```\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the coefficients below the first pivot (1) in the first column:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1:\n```\n| 1  2  3 |  7 |\n| 0  -1 -5 | -10|\n| 3  1  1 |  6 |\n```\n\nRow3 = Row3 - 3 * Row1:\n```\n| 1  2  3 |  7  |\n| 0 -1 -5 | -10 |\n| 0 -5 -8 | -15 |\n```\n\nNext, we will eliminate the coefficients below the second pivot (-1) in the second column:\n\nRow3 = Row3 - 5 * Row2:\n```\n| 1  2  3 |  7  |\n| 0 -1 -5 | -10 |\n| 0  0 17 |  35 |\n```\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nFrom the third row: 17z = 35, so z = 35 / 17.\n\nFrom the second row: -1y - 5z = -10, substituting the value of z, we get -1y - 5(35/17) = -10. Solving for y, we get y = (5 * 35 / 17 + 10) = 25 / 17.\n\nFrom the first row: x + 2y + 3z = 7, substituting the values of y and z, we get x + 2(25/17) + 3(35/17) = 7. Solving for x, we get x = 7 - 2(25/17) - 3(35/17) = 9 / 17.\n\nSo the solution is x = 9/17, y = 25/17, and z = 35/17."
