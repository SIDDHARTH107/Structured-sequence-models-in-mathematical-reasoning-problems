    "message_1": "Suppose the remainders when a certain number $x$ is divided by 5 and 7 are both 2. What is the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$?",
    "message_2": "We are given that $x$ has a remainder of 2 when divided by both 5 and 7. This means that $x$ can be written in the form:\n\n$x = 5a + 2$ and $x = 7b + 2$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are integers.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer value of $x$. To do this, we can set the two expressions for $x$ equal to each other:\n\n$5a + 2 = 7b + 2$\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n$5a = 7b$\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this equation. We can start by trying different values of $a$ and see if we get an integer value for $b$:\n\n- If $a = 1$, then $5 = 7b$, which does not give an integer value for $b$.\n- If $a = 2$, then $10 = 7b$, which does not give an integer value for $b$.\n- If $a = 3$, then $15 = 7b$, which does not give an integer value for $b$.\n- If $a = 4$, then $20 = 7b$, which gives $b = 20/7$, not an integer value for $b$.\n- If $a = 5$, then $25 = 7b$, which gives $b = 25/7$, not an integer value for $b$.\n- If $a = 6$, then $30 = 7b$, which gives $b = 30/7$, not an integer value for $b$.\n- If $a = 7$, then $35 = 7b$, which gives $b = 5$, an integer value for $b$.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the equation are $a = 7$ and $b = 5$. Plugging these values back into either expression for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = 5a + 2 = 5(7) + 2 = 35 + 2 = 37$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$ is $\\boxed{37}$."
