    "message_2": "To graph the inequality y < 2x - 3 on a coordinate plane, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, treat the inequality as an equation and graph the line y = 2x - 3. This line will serve as a boundary for the inequality. The equation is in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In this case, the slope (m) is 2 and the y-intercept (b) is -3. \n\n2. Plot the y-intercept at the point (0, -3) on the coordinate plane.\n\n3. From the y-intercept, use the slope to find another point on the line. Since the slope is 2, this means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y will increase by 2 units. So, starting from the y-intercept (0, -3), move 1 unit to the right and 2 units up to find the next point (1, -1).\n\n4. Draw a dashed line through the points (0, -3) and (1, -1). The dashed line indicates that the points on the line are not included in the solution of the inequality.\n\n5. Now, we need to determine which side of the line contains the solutions to the inequality. Choose a test point that is not on the line, such as the origin (0, 0). Plug the coordinates of the test point into the inequality:\n\n0 < 2(0) - 3\n0 < -3\n\nThis statement is false, so the origin is not part of the solution set. This means that the solutions to the inequality are on the other side of the line.\n\n6. Shade the region of the coordinate plane that is below the line y = 2x - 3, as this is the area where the inequality y < 2x - 3 is true.\n\nThe graph of the inequality y < 2x - 3 is now complete, with a dashed line representing the boundary and the region below the line shaded to indicate the solution set."
