    "message_2": "To find dy/dx, we will first differentiate the given implicit function with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x, we get:\n\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (y^2) + d/dx (2xy) = d/dx (10)\n\nUsing the chain rule and product rule, we have:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) + 2(x(dy/dx) + y) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 2. We can plug x = 2 into the original equation:\n\n(2)^2 + y^2 + 2(2)(y) = 10\n\n4 + y^2 + 4y = 10\n\ny^2 + 4y - 6 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in y. We can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 4, and c = -6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(-6))) / 2(1)\ny = (-4 ± √(16 + 24)) / 2\ny = (-4 ± √40) / 2\n\nWe have two possible values for y: y = (-4 + √40) / 2 and y = (-4 - √40) / 2. \n\nNow, we can plug x = 2 and each value of y into the equation we derived for dy/dx:\n\n2(2) + 2y(dy/dx) + 2(2(dy/dx) + y) = 0\n\nFor y = (-4 + √40) / 2:\n\n4 + (-4 + √40)(dy/dx) + 4(dy/dx) + (-4 + √40) = 0\n\nFor y = (-4 - √40) / 2:\n\n4 + (-4 - √40)(dy/dx) + 4(dy/dx) + (-4 - √40) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve each equation for dy/dx:\n\nFor y = (-4 + √40) / 2:\n\ndy/dx = (4 - (-4 + √40)) / (4 + (-4 + √40))\ndy/dx = (8 - √40) / √40\n\nFor y = (-4 - √40) / 2:\n\ndy/dx = (4 - (-4 - √40)) / (4 + (-4 - √40))\ndy/dx = (8 + √40) / -√40\n\nSo, we have two possible values for dy/dx at the point where x = 2:\n\ndy/dx = (8 - √40) / √40 or dy/dx = (8 + √40) / -√40"
