Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the period-2 solution of this system using the Poincaré map, we first need to find the second intersection point of the Poincaré section. Since the first intersection point is given as (0, 1), we can use the system of differential equations to find the second intersection point.\n\nLet's denote the second intersection point as (x2, y2). We know that at the first intersection point, x = 0 and y = 1. So, we can write the system of differential equations as:\n\nx2' = -1 + 0 - 0^3 = -1\ny2' = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the system to reach the second intersection point. To do this, we can integrate the equations:\n\nx2 = ∫(-1) dt = -t + C1\ny2 = ∫(1) dt = t + C2\n\nSince x2 = 0 at the second intersection point, we have:\n\n0 = -t + C1\nt = C1\n\nNow, substituting this into the equation for y2:\n\ny2 = t + C2 = C1 + C2\n\nSince the first intersection point is (0, 1), we can use this information to find the values of C1 and C2:\n\n1 = C1 + C2\n\nNow, we have two equations and two unknowns:\n\nt = C1\n1 = C1 + C2\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that C1 = 0.5 and C2 = 0.5. Therefore, the second intersection point is (x2, y2) = (0, 1.5).\n\nNow, we can find the period-2 solution by finding the time it takes for the system to travel from the first intersection point to the second intersection point and back to the first intersection point. Since the time it takes to travel from the first intersection point to the second intersection point is 0.5, the period-2 solution is twice this value:\n\nPeriod-2 solution = 2 * 0.5 = 1.00\n\nThus, the period-2 solution of this system is approximately 1.00."
