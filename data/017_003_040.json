    "message_2": "A generator of a group of prime order 17 is an element that generates the entire group when raised to powers from 1 to 16. In other words, it is an element g such that g^1, g^2, ..., g^16 are all distinct elements of the group, and g^17 is the identity element.\n\nTo find a generator for a group of prime order 17, we can consider the multiplicative group modulo 17, which consists of the integers {1, 2, 3, ..., 16} under multiplication modulo 17. The order of this group is 16, which is one less than the prime 17.\n\nTo find a generator, we can test each element of the group to see if it generates the entire group. For example, let's test the element 3:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3^3 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n3^4 ≡ 5 (mod 17)\n3^5 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n3^6 ≡ 11 (mod 17)\n3^7 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n3^8 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nSince 3^8 ≡ 1 (mod 17), 3 is not a generator of the group.\n\nNow let's test the element 2:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n2^4 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n2^5 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n2^6 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n2^7 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n2^8 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n2^9 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n\nSince 2^8 ≡ 1 (mod 17) and all the powers of 2 from 1 to 7 are distinct, 2 is a generator of the group of prime order 17."
