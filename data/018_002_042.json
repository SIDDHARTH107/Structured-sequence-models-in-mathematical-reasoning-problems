A set C is a subset of a set D (denoted by C ⊆ D) if every element of C is also an element of D.\n\n1. Prove A ∩ B ⊆ A:\n\nLet x be an arbitrary element of A ∩ B. By the definition of intersection, x ∈ A and x ∈ B. Since x ∈ A, it follows that A ∩ B ⊆ A.\n\n2. Prove A ∩ B ⊆ B:\n\nLet x be an arbitrary element of A ∩ B. By the definition of intersection, x ∈ A and x ∈ B. Since x ∈ B, it follows that A ∩ B ⊆ B.\n\nThus, we have proved that the intersection A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5} is a subset of each set A and B."
