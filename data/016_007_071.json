    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor the fourth iteration of the Menger sponge, we need to calculate the total number of smaller cubes removed in each iteration.\n\n1st iteration:\n1 larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes, and 7 of them are removed (6 from the faces and 1 from the center).\nTotal removed cubes: 7\n\n2nd iteration:\nEach of the remaining 20 smaller cubes from the 1st iteration undergoes the same process.\nTotal removed cubes: 20 * 7 = 140\n\n3rd iteration:\nEach of the remaining 20^2 = 400 smaller cubes from the 2nd iteration undergoes the same process.\nTotal removed cubes: 400 * 7 = 2800\n\n4th iteration:\nEach of the remaining 20^3 = 8000 smaller cubes from the 3rd iteration undergoes the same process.\nTotal removed cubes: 8000 * 7 = 56000\n\nTo find the total number of smaller cubes removed to obtain the fourth iteration of the sponge, we sum the removed cubes from all iterations:\n\n7 + 140 + 2800 + 56000 = 58,947\n\nSo, a total of 58,947 smaller cubes need to be removed from a Menger sponge of side length 27 cm to obtain the fourth iteration of the sponge."
