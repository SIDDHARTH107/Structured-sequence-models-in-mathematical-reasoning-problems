    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 7x - 2, we will first find the derivative with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3 + 5x^2 + 7x - 2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x + 7\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2)^2 + 10(2) + 7\nf'(2) = 6(4) + 20 + 7\nf'(2) = 24 + 20 + 7\nf'(2) = 51\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 7x - 2 at x = 2 is 51."
