    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 120. We want to determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 120: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5.\n\nNow, let's use Sylow's Theorems to analyze the possible structures of G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's First Theorem, there must exist a subgroup of G of order 8 (2^3). By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of such subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 3, 5, and 15. \n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By Sylow's First Theorem, there must exist a subgroup of G of order 3. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of such subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 and 10.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: By Sylow's First Theorem, there must exist a subgroup of G of order 5. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of such subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possible number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, Sylow's Second Theorem implies that this subgroup is normal in G. Similarly, if G has unique Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups, they are also normal in G. In this case, G would be the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and G would be isomorphic to C2^3 × C3 × C5, which is isomorphic to C120. So, G could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C120.\n\n2. If G has more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, it cannot be isomorphic to C120, as C120 has a unique subgroup of order 8. In this case, G must be one of the non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\n3. The alternating group A5 × C2 × C2 has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, but it has more than one Sylow 2 and 3-subgroups. Therefore, it is not isomorphic to C120, but it is one of the non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the specific group G, we cannot determine whether it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the other 487 non-abelian groups of order 120."
