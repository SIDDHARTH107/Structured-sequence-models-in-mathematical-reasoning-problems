    "message_1": "If there are 10 players in a Public Goods Game, each with an initial endowment of $50, and they all decide to contribute $10 each to the public good, what is the maximum total amount of money that can be allocated to the public good assuming a 50% contribution to the public good is multiplied by a factor of 2 (i.e., every dollar contributed yields $2 of public good value)?",
    "message_2": "If there are 10 players and each contributes $10 to the public good, the total contribution will be 10 * $10 = $100. Since every dollar contributed yields $2 of public good value, the maximum total amount of money that can be allocated to the public good is $100 * 2 = $200."
