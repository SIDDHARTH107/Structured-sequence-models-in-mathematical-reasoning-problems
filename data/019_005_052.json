    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem related to Epistemic logic:\n\nSuppose that Alice and Bob are each given a different number from the set {1, 2, 3}. They both know that their numbers are different, and they both know that the sum of their numbers is either 3 or 4. After they are each asked if they know the value of their number, Alice says \"no\" and Bob says \"no\". What number does each of them have?\n\nAnswer: Alice has the number 2 and Bob has the number 1.",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the possible combinations of numbers given to Alice and Bob:\n\n1. Alice has 1 and Bob has 2 (sum is 3)\n2. Alice has 1 and Bob has 3 (sum is 4)\n3. Alice has 2 and Bob has 1 (sum is 3)\n4. Alice has 2 and Bob has 3 (sum is 5, but this is not possible since they know the sum is either 3 or 4)\n5. Alice has 3 and Bob has 1 (sum is 4)\n6. Alice has 3 and Bob has 2 (sum is 5, but this is not possible since they know the sum is either 3 or 4)\n\nNow, let's analyze their responses:\n\n- Alice says \"no\": This means she cannot determine her number based on the information given. If Alice had the number 1, she would know that Bob has either 2 or 3, and since the sum is either 3 or 4, she would know her number is 1. But she says \"no\", so Alice cannot have the number 1. This eliminates options 1 and 2.\n\n- Bob says \"no\": This means he cannot determine his number based on the information given and Alice's response. If Bob had the number 3, he would know that Alice has either 1 or 2, and since Alice said \"no\", he would know that Alice has 2 and his number is 3. But he says \"no\", so Bob cannot have the number 3. This eliminates option 5.\n\nThe only remaining option is 3, where Alice has the number 2 and Bob has the number 1."
