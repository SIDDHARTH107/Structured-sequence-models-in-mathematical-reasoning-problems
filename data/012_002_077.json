    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph with 6 nodes, we need to consider the maximum degree of the graph, which is the maximum number of edges connected to a single node.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every node is connected to every other node. In this case, the maximum degree is 5, as each node is connected to the other 5 nodes.\n\nAccording to the graph coloring theorem, the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph is equal to the chromatic number, which is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFor a complete graph with 6 nodes, the chromatic number is equal to the maximum degree plus 1, which is 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph with 6 nodes, such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, is 6."
