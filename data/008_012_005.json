    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using the method of inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the matrix of variables, and B is the matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  6 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 8  |\n    | 16 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (denoted as A^(-1)). To do this, we first need to find the determinant of A (denoted as |A|).\n\n|A| = (2 * 6) - (3 * 4) = 12 - 12 = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the matrix A is singular, and it does not have an inverse. This means that we cannot use the method of inverse matrices to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nHowever, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (4x + 6y = 2 * (2x + 3y)). This means that the two equations are not independent, and the system has infinitely many solutions or no solution. In this case, since the second equation is a multiple of the first equation, the system has infinitely many solutions."
