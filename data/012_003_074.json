    "message_2": "As I cannot see the graph you are referring to, I cannot provide a specific answer to the size of the maximum independent set. However, I can give you a general approach to finding the maximum independent set in an undirected graph.\n\n1. Identify all the independent sets in the graph. An independent set is a set of vertices where no two vertices are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge connecting them).\n2. Compare the sizes of the independent sets and choose the largest one.\n\nYou can also use algorithms like the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to find all maximal independent sets in a graph, and then choose the largest one as the maximum independent set.\n\nPlease provide the graph or a description of the graph, and I will be happy to help you find the size of the maximum independent set."
