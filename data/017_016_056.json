    "message_2": "Case 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27\n\nLet G = <g> be a cyclic group of order 27. Then, the order of g is 27. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Thus, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, 9, and 27. \n\nNow, let's consider the elements of order 3. If h is an element of order 3 in G, then h^3 = e (the identity element), and h ≠ e. Since G is cyclic, h = g^k for some integer k. Then, (g^k)^3 = g^(3k) = e. Since the order of g is 27, we must have 27 | 3k, which implies that 9 | k. Let k = 9t for some integer t. Then, h = g^(9t). \n\nSince 9 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition, the unique element of order 3 in G is g^9. Therefore, G has a unique element of order 3.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27\n\nLet G be a non-abelian group of order 27. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G (denoted by n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 | 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. Since G is non-abelian, n_3 cannot be 1. If n_3 = 9 or 27, then G would have at least 9 * 2 = 18 or 27 * 2 = 54 elements of order 3 (since each Sylow 3-subgroup has 2 non-identity elements of order 3), which is not possible in a group of order 27. Therefore, n_3 = 3.\n\nLet P, Q, and R be the three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Each of these subgroups has order 9 and is cyclic (since any group of order p^2, where p is prime, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, and the latter case is abelian, which contradicts the non-abelian property of G). Let P = <a>, Q = <b>, and R = <c>, where a, b, and c have order 9.\n\nNow, consider the elements of order 3 in G. If x is an element of order 3 in G, then x^3 = e, and x ≠ e. Since x must belong to one of the Sylow 3-subgroups, without loss of generality, let x ∈ P. Then, x = a^k for some integer k. Then, (a^k)^3 = a^(3k) = e. Since the order of a is 9, we must have 9 | 3k, which implies that 3 | k. Let k = 3t for some integer t. Then, x = a^(3t).\n\nSince 3 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition, the unique element of order 3 in P is a^3. Similarly, the unique elements of order 3 in Q and R are b^3 and c^3, respectively. Therefore, G has exactly three elements of order 3: a^3, b^3, and c^3."
