    "message_1": "The question for the math student is:\n\nA system operates with an input signal given by x(t), where x(t) = cos(2π(50)t) for t ≥ 0. The system's output signal is y(t) = cos(2π(50)t + θ), where θ is random phase angle with uniform distribution in [0, 2π). Use Fourier analysis to find the power of the output signal.",
    "message_2": "To find the power of the output signal y(t) using Fourier analysis, we first need to find the Fourier transform of y(t). Since y(t) is a cosine function with a random phase angle θ, we can represent it as the sum of two orthogonal sinusoids:\n\ny(t) = A*cos(2π(50)t) + B*sin(2π(50)t)\n\nwhere A and B are random variables representing the amplitudes of the cosine and sine components, respectively. The random phase angle θ affects the values of A and B, but not the frequency of the sinusoids.\n\nNow, let's find the power of y(t). The power of a signal is the square of its amplitude, averaged over time. Since the cosine and sine components are orthogonal, their powers add up:\n\nP_y(t) = E[A^2] + E[B^2]\n\nwhere E[.] denotes the expected value. Since θ is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π), the expected values of A^2 and B^2 are equal:\n\nE[A^2] = E[B^2] = 1/2\n\nThis is because the cosine and sine functions have an amplitude of 1, and when squared and averaged over a full period, they each contribute half of the total power.\n\nTherefore, the power of the output signal y(t) is:\n\nP_y(t) = E[A^2] + E[B^2] = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n\nSo, the power of the output signal y(t) is 1."
