    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(x), then the Fourier transform of y''(x) is (iω)^2 Y(ω) = -ω^2 Y(ω).\n\nNow, applying the Fourier transform to the given differential equation:\n\n-ω^2 Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = 0\n\nThis is an algebraic equation in Y(ω), which can be solved as:\n\nY(ω) = C / (ω^2 + 4)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to obtain the solution y(x). The inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) is given by:\n\ny(x) = (1 / (2π)) ∫[C / (ω^2 + 4)] e^(iωx) dω\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial conditions. Since y(0) = 1, we have:\n\n1 = (1 / (2π)) ∫[C / (ω^2 + 4)] e^(iω(0)) dω\n1 = (1 / (2π)) ∫[C / (ω^2 + 4)] dω\n\nNow, we can find C by solving this integral:\n\nC = 2π\n\nNow, we have:\n\nY(ω) = 2π / (ω^2 + 4)\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform, we get:\n\ny(x) = (1 / (2π)) ∫[(2π) / (ω^2 + 4)] e^(iωx) dω\n\ny(x) = ∫[1 / (ω^2 + 4)] e^(iωx) dω\n\nNow, we need to solve this integral to obtain the solution y(x). This integral can be solved using contour integration or by recognizing it as a standard integral involving the sine and cosine functions. The integral evaluates to:\n\ny(x) = cos(2x)\n\nNow, we need to check if this solution satisfies the second initial condition, y'(0) = 0:\n\ny'(x) = -2 sin(2x)\n\ny'(0) = -2 sin(0) = 0\n\nThus, the solution y(x) = cos(2x) satisfies both initial conditions, and it is the solution to the given differential equation."
