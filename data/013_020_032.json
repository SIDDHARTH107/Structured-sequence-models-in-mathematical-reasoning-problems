    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest game where there are 10 players. Each player has to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game will be the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. Find the equilibrium of the game.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium of the game, we need to consider the thought process of the players. Let's assume that all players are rational and know that the other players are rational as well.\n\n1. If all players choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average would be around 50. So, a rational player would choose 2/3 of 50, which is 33.33.\n\n2. However, if all players think like this and choose 33.33, the new average would be 33.33. So, a rational player would choose 2/3 of 33.33, which is 22.22.\n\n3. If all players think like this and choose 22.22, the new average would be 22.22. So, a rational player would choose 2/3 of 22.22, which is 14.81.\n\nThis process continues, and the chosen numbers keep getting smaller. In the limit, as players keep iterating this thought process, the chosen numbers will approach 0. Therefore, the equilibrium of the game is when all players choose 0. In this case, the average is 0, and 2/3 of the average is also 0, so all players would be equally close to the winning condition."
