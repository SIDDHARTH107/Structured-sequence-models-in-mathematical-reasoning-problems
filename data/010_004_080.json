Consider the open cover {U_i}_(i∈I) of A such that U_i = (i − 1, i + 1) for each i ∈ I, where I is a countable set of integers. \n\nIf A is compact, what is the largest integer N such that A is contained in the union of the sets U_1, U_2, . . . , U_N?",
    "message_2": "Since A is compact, every open cover of A has a finite subcover. In this case, the open cover is given by {U_i}_(i∈I) where U_i = (i - 1, i + 1) for each i ∈ I, and I is a countable set of integers.\n\nLet's consider the finite subcover of A, which consists of the sets U_1, U_2, ..., U_N. Since A is contained in the union of these sets, we have:\n\nA ⊆ U_1 ∪ U_2 ∪ ... ∪ U_N.\n\nNow, let's find the largest integer N such that this condition holds. To do this, we need to find the maximum and minimum elements of A.\n\nLet a_min and a_max be the minimum and maximum elements of A, respectively. Since A is compact, it is bounded, so these values exist. Now, we need to find the smallest and largest indices i such that a_min ∈ U_i and a_max ∈ U_i, respectively.\n\nFor a_min ∈ U_i, we have:\n\ni - 1 < a_min < i + 1.\n\nSince i is an integer, we can say that i = ceil(a_min), where ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.\n\nSimilarly, for a_max ∈ U_i, we have:\n\ni - 1 < a_max < i + 1.\n\nIn this case, i = floor(a_max), where floor(x) is the largest integer less than or equal to x.\n\nNow, the largest integer N such that A is contained in the union of the sets U_1, U_2, ..., U_N is given by:\n\nN = floor(a_max) - ceil(a_min) + 1.\n\nThis is because there are N consecutive integers from ceil(a_min) to floor(a_max) inclusive, and each of these integers corresponds to a set U_i in the finite subcover of A."
