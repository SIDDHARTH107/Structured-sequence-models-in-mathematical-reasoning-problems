    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 2x^2 - 8x + 6\nWe can factor out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the terms, which is 2.\n2(x^2 - 4x + 3)\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nSo, the factored numerator is: 2(x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nDenominator: x^2 - 9\nThis is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:\n(x + 3)(x - 3)\n\nNow, the rational expression is:\n[2(x - 3)(x - 1)] / [(x + 3)(x - 3)]\n\nWe can now cancel out the common factor (x - 3) from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n2(x - 1) / (x + 3)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(2x - 2) / (x + 3)"
