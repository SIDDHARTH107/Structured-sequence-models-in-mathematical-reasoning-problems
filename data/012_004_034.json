    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weight.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the MST.\n3. Add the next edge with the lowest weight to the MST, making sure it doesn't form a cycle.\n4. Repeat step 3 until we have (number of vertices - 1) edges in the MST.\n\nLet's sort the edges by weight:\n\n1. (A, B) - 1\n2. (B, C) - 2\n3. (A, D) - 3\n4. (C, D) - 4\n5. (B, E) - 5\n6. (D, F) - 6\n7. (C, F) - 7\n8. (E, F) - 8\n\nNow, let's build the MST:\n\n1. Add edge (A, B) with weight 1. MST = {(A, B)}\n2. Add edge (B, C) with weight 2. MST = {(A, B), (B, C)}\n3. Add edge (A, D) with weight 3. MST = {(A, B), (B, C), (A, D)}\n4. Adding edge (C, D) with weight 4 would form a cycle, so we skip it.\n5. Add edge (B, E) with weight 5. MST = {(A, B), (B, C), (A, D), (B, E)}\n6. Add edge (D, F) with weight 6. MST = {(A, B), (B, C), (A, D), (B, E), (D, F)}\n\nNow we have 5 edges in the MST (which is equal to the number of vertices - 1), so we stop.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is: {(A, B), (B, C), (A, D), (B, E), (D, F)}\n\nThe total weight of the MST is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17."
