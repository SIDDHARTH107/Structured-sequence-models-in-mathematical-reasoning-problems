The data for Company B is as follows: 30,000, 32,000, 38,000, 42,000, 48,000, 55,000. \n\nCalculate the median salaries of employees in each company and determine which company has the higher median salary.",
    "message_2": "To find the median salary for each company, we first need to make sure the data is sorted in ascending order, which it already is. Then, we find the middle value of the dataset. If there is an even number of data points, we take the average of the two middle values.\n\nFor Company A, there are 5 data points, so the median is the middle value, which is the 3rd value in the sorted list:\n28,000, 35,000, 40,000, 45,000, 50,000\nThe median salary for Company A is 40,000.\n\nFor Company B, there are 6 data points, so the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values in the sorted list:\n30,000, 32,000, 38,000, 42,000, 48,000, 55,000\n(38,000 + 42,000) / 2 = 80,000 / 2 = 40,000\nThe median salary for Company B is 40,000.\n\nBoth companies have the same median salary of 40,000."
