If G does not contain an element of order 20, show that G must contain at least one element of order 5 and an element of order 2, and prove that G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20.",
    "message_2": "Case 1: G contains an element of order 20\n\nLet x be an element of order 20 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by x, denoted by <x>, has order 20. Since the order of <x> is equal to the order of G, it follows that G = <x>. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 20, and it is isomorphic to C20.\n\nCase 2: G does not contain an element of order 20\n\nBy Sylow's Theorem, G has a subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 4. Let H be a subgroup of order 5 and K be a subgroup of order 4. Since 5 is prime, H is cyclic and must have an element of order 5. Similarly, K must have an element of order 2.\n\nNow, we know that |H| = 5 and |K| = 4, and gcd(5, 4) = 1. By the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem, G has a semi-direct product decomposition G = H ⋊ K. This means that G is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of H and K, which can be either the dihedral group D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, we can look at the action of K on H by conjugation. If this action is trivial, then G is isomorphic to the direct product H × K, which is the non-abelian group of order 20. If the action is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nIn conclusion, if G does not contain an element of order 20, it must contain at least one element of order 5 and an element of order 2, and G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20."
