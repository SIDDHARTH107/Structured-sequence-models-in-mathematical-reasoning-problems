    "message_1": "A company has 10 employees, and the probability of any employee committing financial fraud is 0.05. What is the probability that at least one employee commits financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one employee commits financial fraud, it's easier to first find the probability that none of the employees commit financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of an employee not committing financial fraud is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 10 employees, the probability that none of them commit financial fraud is 0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987.\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one employee commits financial fraud, we subtract the probability that none of them commit financial fraud from 1:\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one employee commits financial fraud is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
