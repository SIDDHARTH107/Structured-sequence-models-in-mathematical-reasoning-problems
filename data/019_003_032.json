If the formula K(p ∧ q) → (Kp ∧ Kr) is valid in a given model, prove that the formula Mp ∧ Mq → (M(p ∧ q) ∧ (Mp ∨ Mq)) is also valid in the same model.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the formula Mp ∧ Mq → (M(p ∧ q) ∧ (Mp ∨ Mq)) is valid in the same model, we will use the duality between the modal operators K and M. The duality states that Mϕ is equivalent to ¬K¬ϕ. Using this duality, we can rewrite the given formula as follows:\n\nMp ∧ Mq → (M(p ∧ q) ∧ (Mp ∨ Mq))\n¬K¬p ∧ ¬K¬q → (¬K(¬p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (¬K¬p ∨ ¬K¬q))\n\nNow, let's use the given valid formula K(p ∧ q) → (Kp ∧ Kr) and apply the contrapositive rule, which states that a formula ϕ → ψ is equivalent to ¬ψ → ¬ϕ. Applying the contrapositive rule to the given formula, we get:\n\n¬(Kp ∧ Kr) → ¬K(p ∧ q)\n(¬Kp ∨ ¬Kr) → ¬K(p ∧ q)\n\nNow, let's use the distribution law to distribute ¬K over the disjunction:\n\n(¬Kp ∨ ¬Kr) → (¬Kp ∨ ¬Kq)\n\nNotice that the right side of this formula is the same as the right side of the formula we want to prove. Therefore, we just need to show that the left side of the formula we want to prove, ¬K¬p ∧ ¬K¬q, implies the left side of the contrapositive formula, ¬Kp ∨ ¬Kr.\n\nAssume ¬K¬p ∧ ¬K¬q is true. By the distribution law, this is equivalent to:\n\n(¬K¬p ∧ ¬K¬q) → (¬K¬p ∨ ¬K¬q)\n\nSince the right side of this formula is the same as the right side of the contrapositive formula, and we have shown that the left side of the formula we want to prove implies the left side of the contrapositive formula, we can conclude that the formula Mp ∧ Mq → (M(p ∧ q) ∧ (Mp ∨ Mq)) is also valid in the same model."
