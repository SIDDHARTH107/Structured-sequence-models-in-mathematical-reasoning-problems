    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x + 5| = 13, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 5 = 13\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n2x = 8\nDivide by 2:\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 2x + 5 = -13\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n2x = -18\nDivide by 2:\nx = -9\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation |2x + 5| = 13 are x = 4 and x = -9."
