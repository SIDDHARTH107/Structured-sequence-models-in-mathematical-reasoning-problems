You do not know the contents of the boxes. \n\nNow, your friend makes the following two statements:\n(1) \"Box A contains a red ball.\"\n(2) \"If box B contains a red ball, then box C also contains a red ball.\"\n\nWhat can you infer about the contents of the three boxes?",
    "message_2": "From statement (1), we can infer that box A contains a red ball.\n\nFor statement (2), we have two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Box B contains a red ball. In this case, according to statement (2), box C must also contain a red ball.\n\nScenario 2: Box B contains a blue ball. In this case, statement (2) doesn't provide any information about the contents of box C. Box C could contain either a red ball or a blue ball.\n\nIn conclusion, we can infer that box A contains a red ball, while box B and box C can have the following combinations:\n\n- Box B contains a red ball, and box C contains a red ball.\n- Box B contains a blue ball, and box C contains either a red ball or a blue ball."
