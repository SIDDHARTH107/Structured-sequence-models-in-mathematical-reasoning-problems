    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface S at the point (1, 0, 0), we first need to find the gradient (normal vector) of the surface at that point.\n\nThe gradient of a scalar function F(x, y, z) is given by the vector (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z). In our case, the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we evaluate the gradient at the point (1, 0, 0):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 0, 0) = 2(1) = 2\n∂F/∂y(1, 0, 0) = 2(0) = 0\n∂F/∂z(1, 0, 0) = 2(0) = 0\n\nSo, the gradient (normal vector) at the point (1, 0, 0) is (2, 0, 0).\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector, and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point on the plane. In our case, (A, B, C) = (2, 0, 0) and (x₀, y₀, z₀) = (1, 0, 0). Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n2(x - 1) + 0(y - 0) + 0(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x - 2 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface S at the point (1, 0, 0) is:\n\n2x - 2 = 0"
