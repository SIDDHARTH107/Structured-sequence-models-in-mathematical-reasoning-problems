    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3, we will use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Show that a group of order 6 must have an element of order 2 or 3.\nStep 2: Show that if a group has an element of order 6, it is isomorphic to C6.\nStep 3: Show that if a group has elements of order 2 and 3 but not 6, it is isomorphic to D3.\n\nStep 1: A group of order 6 must have an element of order 2 or 3.\nLet G be a group of order 6. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Since the identity element has order 1, there must be at least one element of order 2 or 3.\n\nStep 2: If a group has an element of order 6, it is isomorphic to C6.\nSuppose G has an element of order 6, say a. Then G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}, where e is the identity element. This shows that G is a cyclic group generated by a, and thus G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nExample: The group of integers modulo 6 under addition, Z6, is isomorphic to C6. The elements are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and the group is generated by 1, as 1 has order 6.\n\nStep 3: If a group has elements of order 2 and 3 but not 6, it is isomorphic to D3.\nSuppose G has an element of order 2, say a, and an element of order 3, say b, but no element of order 6. Then G = {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2}. We can verify that the following relations hold: a^2 = e, b^3 = e, and (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = e. These relations are the same as those in the dihedral group D3, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nExample: The dihedral group D3 itself is an example. It consists of the identity (rotation by 0 degrees), a reflection through a vertex, a rotation by 120 degrees, a rotation by 240 degrees, a reflection through an edge, and a reflection through the opposite edge. The rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 3, and the reflections have order 2.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
