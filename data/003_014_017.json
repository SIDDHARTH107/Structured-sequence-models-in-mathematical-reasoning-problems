    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the given function y = 2sin(3x + π/4), we need to compare it to the general form of a sine function: y = A*sin(Bx + C).\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 2, so the amplitude is 2.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In this case, B = 3, so the period is (2π)/3.\n\nPhase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value of C divided by B, with the opposite sign. In this case, C = π/4 and B = 3, so the phase shift is -(π/4)/3 or -π/12.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π)/3, and the phase shift is -π/12."
