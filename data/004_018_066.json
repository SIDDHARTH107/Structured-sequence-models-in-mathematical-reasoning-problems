    "message_2": "To find the derivative f'(x) of the function f(x) = 3x^5 + 2x^3 - 7x, we will apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nFor the term 3x^5:\nn = 5, so f'(3x^5) = 5 * 3x^(5-1) = 15x^4\n\nFor the term 2x^3:\nn = 3, so f'(2x^3) = 3 * 2x^(3-1) = 6x^2\n\nFor the term -7x:\nn = 1, so f'(-7x) = 1 * -7x^(1-1) = -7\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^4 + 6x^2 - 7"
