    "message_1": "A coffee shop owner wants to determine the optimal price to sell their special blend of coffee. The owner knows that for every $0.50 increase in price, the number of cups sold decreases by 10. The cost of making one cup of coffee is $0.40. If the owner wants to maximize their profit, what should be the price per cup of coffee?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of $0.50 increases in price, and let P be the initial price per cup of coffee. Then, the price per cup after x increases is P + 0.50x. The number of cups sold after x increases is C - 10x, where C is the initial number of cups sold.\n\nThe profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit = (Price per cup - Cost per cup) * Number of cups sold\nProfit = ((P + 0.50x) - 0.40) * (C - 10x)\n\nTo find the optimal price, we need to find the maximum value of the profit function. We can do this by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dx = ((P + 0.50x) - 0.40)' * (C - 10x) + ((P + 0.50x) - 0.40) * (C - 10x)'\n\nTaking the derivative:\n\nd(Profit)/dx = (0.50) * (C - 10x) - ((P + 0.50x) - 0.40) * 10\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0:\n\n0 = 0.50 * (C - 10x) - ((P + 0.50x) - 0.40) * 10\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (0.50 * C - 10 * P + 4) / 15\n\nNow we can find the optimal price per cup by plugging x back into the price function:\n\nOptimal Price = P + 0.50x\n\nSince we don't have the initial values for P and C, we can't provide a specific numerical answer. However, the coffee shop owner can use this formula to find the optimal price based on their initial price and number of cups sold."
