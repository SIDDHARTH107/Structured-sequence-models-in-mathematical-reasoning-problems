    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces two types of chairs: a standard chair and a deluxe chair. Each standard chair can be sold for $100 and each deluxe chair can be sold for $150. The manufacturer has 50 hours of carpentry time and 30 hours of painting time each week. The standard chair requires 2 hours of carpentry time and 1 hour of painting time, while the deluxe chair requires 3 hours of carpentry time and 2 hours of painting time. How many standard chairs and deluxe chairs should the manufacturer produce each week in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of standard chairs and y be the number of deluxe chairs.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 100x + 150y\n\nConstraints based on the available carpentry and painting time are:\n2x + 3y ≤ 50 (carpentry time)\nx + 2y ≤ 30 (painting time)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity)\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 50\ny ≤ (50 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 30\ny ≤ (30 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. By graphing the constraints, we find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (0, 15)\nC. (10, 10)\nD. (20, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P at each vertex:\n\nA. P(0, 0) = 100(0) + 150(0) = $0\nB. P(0, 15) = 100(0) + 150(15) = $2250\nC. P(10, 10) = 100(10) + 150(10) = $2500\nD. P(20, 0) = 100(20) + 150(0) = $2000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, where the manufacturer should produce 10 standard chairs and 10 deluxe chairs each week. The maximum profit will be $2500."
