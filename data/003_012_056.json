    "message_1": "Sure! Here's an example question:\n\nA building is 60 meters tall. An observer standing on the ground is looking up at the top of the building at an angle of 37 degrees. What is the angle of elevation from the top of the building to the observer's eye?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation from the top of the building to the observer's eye, we can use the concept of complementary angles. In a right triangle, the sum of the two non-right angles is always 90 degrees.\n\nSince the observer is looking up at the top of the building at an angle of 37 degrees, the angle between the ground and the line of sight is 37 degrees. The angle of elevation from the top of the building to the observer's eye is the complementary angle to this 37-degree angle.\n\nTo find the complementary angle, subtract the given angle from 90 degrees:\n\n90 - 37 = 53 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of elevation from the top of the building to the observer's eye is 53 degrees."
