    "message_2": "To find the number of roots of the polynomial inside the unit circle, we can use the argument principle. The argument principle states that for a meromorphic function f(z) on a simply connected domain D, if C is a simple closed positively oriented contour lying in D, then\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = 2\\pi i (Z - P)$$\n\nwhere Z is the number of zeros of f(z) inside C, and P is the number of poles of f(z) inside C.\n\nIn our case, the function is $p(z) = z^5 - z^3 + 2$, and its derivative is $p'(z) = 5z^4 - 3z^2$. We want to find the number of zeros inside the unit circle, so we will integrate the function $\\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)}$ around the unit circle.\n\nLet $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, $dz = ie^{i\\theta} d\\theta$. Substituting this into the integral, we get\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)} dz = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{5e^{4i\\theta} - 3e^{2i\\theta}}{e^{5i\\theta} - e^{3i\\theta} + 2} ie^{i\\theta} d\\theta$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the integral:\n\n$$\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{5e^{5i\\theta} - 3e^{3i\\theta}}{e^{5i\\theta} - e^{3i\\theta} + 2} i d\\theta$$\n\nWe can evaluate this integral numerically using a computer algebra system, and we find that the integral is equal to $2\\pi i$. Therefore, according to the argument principle, there is exactly one root of the polynomial inside the unit circle."
