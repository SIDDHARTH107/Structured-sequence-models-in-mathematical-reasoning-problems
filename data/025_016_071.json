    "message_1": "Let X and Y be smooth projective curves over a field k. If there exists a dominant rational map from X to Y, both have the same genus, and X has at least one point not in the image of the rational map, then their function fields k(X) and k(Y) are birationally equivalent. \n\nSuppose X is a smooth projective curve with genus 3, Y is a smooth projective curve with genus 2, and there exists a dominant rational map from X to Y. If a point P on X is not in the image of the rational map, what is the degree of the extension [k(X):k(Y)] of their function fields?",
    "message_2": "Since there exists a dominant rational map from X to Y, the function field k(X) is a finite extension of k(Y). Let d = [k(X):k(Y)] be the degree of this extension. By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we have:\n\n2g(X) - 2 = d(2g(Y) - 2) + R,\n\nwhere g(X) and g(Y) are the genera of X and Y, respectively, and R is the ramification term.\n\nGiven that g(X) = 3 and g(Y) = 2, we can plug these values into the Riemann-Hurwitz formula:\n\n2(3) - 2 = d(2(2) - 2) + R\n4 = 2d + R.\n\nSince d is a positive integer and R is non-negative, the only possible value for d is 2. Therefore, the degree of the extension [k(X):k(Y)] is 2."
