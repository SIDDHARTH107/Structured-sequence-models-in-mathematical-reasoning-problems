    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Therefore, we are looking for the smallest positive integer n that is not prime, such that (n-1)! + 1 is not divisible by n.\n\nLet's test the smallest composite (non-prime) number, which is 4:\n\n(n-1)! + 1 = (4-1)! + 1 = 3! + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n7 is not divisible by 4, so the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the condition is n = 4."
