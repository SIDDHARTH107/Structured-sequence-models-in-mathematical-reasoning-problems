    "message_2": "The number of rounds needed to encrypt a 64-bit plaintext using a Feistel cipher structure does not depend on the size of the key or the subkeys. Instead, it depends on the specific Feistel cipher implementation and its security requirements.\n\nFor example, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) uses a Feistel structure with 16 rounds, while the more secure Triple DES (3DES) applies the DES cipher three times, effectively using 48 rounds. Other Feistel ciphers may use a different number of rounds based on their design and security requirements.\n\nSo, without information about the specific Feistel cipher implementation, it is not possible to determine the exact number of rounds needed for encryption."
