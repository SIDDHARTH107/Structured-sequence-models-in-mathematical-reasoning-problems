    "message_1": "Consider a signaling game where two players, Player 1 and Player 2, are involved. Player 1 has two types: High (H) and Low (L), and Player 2 has three actions: A1, A2, and A3. The payoff matrix for the game is given below:\n\n        A1   A2   A3\n    H   4    1    0\n    L   2    3    1\n\nIf Player 1 chooses the High type with a probability of 0.7 and the Low type with a probability of 0.3, what is the expected payoff for Player 2 if they choose action A2?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected payoff for Player 2 when they choose action A2, we need to consider the probabilities of Player 1's types and the corresponding payoffs for Player 2.\n\nExpected payoff for Player 2 when choosing A2 = (Probability of High type * Payoff for High type) + (Probability of Low type * Payoff for Low type)\n\nExpected payoff = (0.7 * 1) + (0.3 * 3)\n\nExpected payoff = 0.7 + 0.9\n\nExpected payoff = 1.6\n\nSo, the expected payoff for Player 2 if they choose action A2 is 1.6."
