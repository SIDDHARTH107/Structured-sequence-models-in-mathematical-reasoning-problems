    "message_2": "First, we need to identify the prime numbers between 50 and 70. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have only two factors: 1 and themselves. The prime numbers between 50 and 70 are:\n\n53, 59, 61, 67\n\nNow, we will find the sum of these prime numbers:\n\n53 + 59 + 61 + 67 = 240\n\nThe sum of all prime numbers between 50 and 70 inclusive is 240."
