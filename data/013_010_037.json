    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms in a market producing a homogenous good. The inverse demand function is given by P = 20 - Q, where Q is the total quantity produced. Both firms have the same constant marginal cost of $4 per unit. Using the Cournot model, what is the equilibrium level of output for each firm and the corresponding market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium level of output for each firm and the corresponding market price using the Cournot model, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction functions for both firms.\n2. Solve for the equilibrium quantities for both firms.\n3. Calculate the total quantity produced and the market price.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction functions for both firms.\nLet q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2. The inverse demand function is P = 20 - Q.\n\nFirm 1's revenue is R1 = P * q1 = (20 - Q) * q1 = (20 - (q1 + q2)) * q1.\nFirm 2's revenue is R2 = P * q2 = (20 - Q) * q2 = (20 - (q1 + q2)) * q2.\n\nSince both firms have the same constant marginal cost of $4 per unit, their cost functions are C1 = 4 * q1 and C2 = 4 * q2.\n\nFirm 1's profit is π1 = R1 - C1 = (20 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 4 * q1.\nFirm 2's profit is π2 = R2 - C2 = (20 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 4 * q2.\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to find the first-order conditions for profit maximization for both firms:\n\n∂π1/∂q1 = 20 - 2 * q1 - q2 - 4 = 0\n∂π2/∂q2 = 20 - 2 * q2 - q1 - 4 = 0\n\nStep 2: Solve for the equilibrium quantities for both firms.\nWe can solve the system of equations to find the equilibrium quantities for both firms:\n\nq1 = 8 - 0.5 * q2\nq2 = 8 - 0.5 * q1\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\nq2 = 8 - 0.5 * (8 - 0.5 * q2)\nq2 = 8 - 4 + 0.25 * q2\n0.75 * q2 = 4\nq2 = 16/3 ≈ 5.33\n\nNow, we can find q1:\n\nq1 = 8 - 0.5 * q2\nq1 = 8 - 0.5 * (16/3)\nq1 = 8 - 8/3\nq1 = 16/3 ≈ 5.33\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total quantity produced and the market price.\nThe total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2 = 16/3 + 16/3 = 32/3 ≈ 10.67.\n\nThe market price can be found using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 20 - Q\nP = 20 - 32/3\nP = 28/3 ≈ 9.33\n\nSo, the equilibrium level of output for each firm is approximately 5.33 units, and the corresponding market price is approximately $9.33."
