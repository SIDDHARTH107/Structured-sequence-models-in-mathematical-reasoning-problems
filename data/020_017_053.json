    "message_1": "A factory currently produces 1800 widgets a day at a cost of $2 per widget. The factory manager wants to maximize the profit by optimizing the production output. The selling price of each widget is $5 and the daily fixed cost of running the factory is $3000. What is the optimum number of widgets the factory should produce daily to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimum number of widgets to produce daily to maximize profit, we need to first determine the profit function. The profit function is the difference between the revenue and the total cost.\n\nLet x be the number of widgets produced daily.\n\nRevenue = Selling price per widget * Number of widgets = $5x\nVariable cost = Cost per widget * Number of widgets = $2x\nFixed cost = $3000\n\nTotal cost = Variable cost + Fixed cost = $2x + $3000\n\nProfit = Revenue - Total cost = $5x - ($2x + $3000) = $3x - $3000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. However, since the profit function is a linear function, there are no critical points. In this case, the profit will keep increasing as the number of widgets produced increases.\n\nHowever, there might be practical constraints on the maximum number of widgets that can be produced daily, such as the factory's production capacity, labor availability, or market demand. These constraints should be taken into account when determining the optimum number of widgets to produce daily.\n\nIn the absence of such constraints, the factory should aim to produce as many widgets as possible to maximize profit."
