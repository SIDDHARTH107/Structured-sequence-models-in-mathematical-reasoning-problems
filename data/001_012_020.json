    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 3x^2 - 12x\nFactor out the common term 3x:\n3x(x - 4)\n\nDenominator: 2x^2 - 8\nFactor out the common term 2:\n2(x^2 - 4)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n(3x(x - 4)) / (2(x^2 - 4))\n\nNext, we factor the difference of squares in the denominator:\n(x^2 - 4) = (x - 2)(x + 2)\n\nSo, the rational expression becomes:\n(3x(x - 4)) / (2(x - 2)(x + 2))\n\nNow, we simplify the expression by canceling out any common factors between the numerator and the denominator. In this case, there are no common factors, so the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(3x(x - 4)) / (2(x - 2)(x + 2))"
