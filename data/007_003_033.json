    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 121 is divided by 10 using modular arithmetic, we can use the modulo operation. The modulo operation is denoted by the percentage symbol (%) and returns the remainder of a division.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n121 % 10 = 1\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 121 is divided by 10 is 1."
