    "message_2": "To find the degree of X, we need to use the formula for the degree of a Fano variety, which is given by:\n\nDegree(X) = (-K_X)^n\n\nSince X is a Fano variety, we know that -K_X is an ample divisor. We can express -K_X in terms of H, as follows:\n\n-K_X = aH for some positive integer a.\n\nNow, we are given that K_XH^{n-1} = -d. We can rewrite this equation using the expression for -K_X:\n\n(aH)H^{n-1} = -d\n\nNow, we can substitute -K_X back into the formula for the degree of X:\n\nDegree(X) = (-K_X)^n = (aH)^n\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, we can expand this expression:\n\nDegree(X) = a^nH^n\n\nWe are given that H^n = 2d + 1. Substituting this into the equation for the degree, we get:\n\nDegree(X) = a^n(2d + 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of a. We can use the equation (aH)H^{n-1} = -d:\n\naH^n = -dH\n\na(2d + 1) = -dH\n\na = -dH / (2d + 1)\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of a back into the equation for the degree of X:\n\nDegree(X) = (-dH / (2d + 1))^n(2d + 1)\n\nDegree(X) = (-dH)^n / (2d + 1)^(n-1)\n\nSince H is a hyperplane class, its degree is 1. Therefore, we can simplify the expression:\n\nDegree(X) = (-d)^n / (2d + 1)^(n-1)\n\nThis is the degree of X in terms of d and n."
