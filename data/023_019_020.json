    "message_2": "To determine the stability of a control system using its transfer function G(s), we need to analyze the poles of the system. The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero. If all the poles have negative real parts, the system is stable.\n\nGiven the transfer function:\n\nG(s) = (6s + 9) / (s^2 + 5s + 4)\n\nFirst, we need to find the poles by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\ns^2 + 5s + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots (the poles) using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 5, and c = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-5 ± √(5^2 - 4 * 1 * 4)) / (2 * 1)\ns = (-5 ± √(25 - 16)) / 2\ns = (-5 ± √9) / 2\ns = (-5 ± 3) / 2\n\nThis gives us two poles:\n\ns1 = (-5 + 3) / 2 = -1\ns2 = (-5 - 3) / 2 = -4\n\nBoth poles have negative real parts (-1 and -4), so the system is stable."
