    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we can use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 32 = 2^5, we are looking for the number of non-isomorphic 2-groups of order 2^5.\n\nWe can use the following theorem: The number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, is equal to the number of partitions of n.\n\nThe number of partitions of 5 (the exponent of 2 in the order of the group) is 7. These partitions are:\n\n1. 5\n2. 4 + 1\n3. 3 + 2\n4. 3 + 1 + 1\n5. 2 + 2 + 1\n6. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n7. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nTherefore, there are 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
