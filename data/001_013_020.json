    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(x + 5) = 7, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n(√(x + 5))^2 = 7^2\n\n2. Simplify the equation.\nx + 5 = 49\n\n3. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.\nx = 49 - 5\n\n4. Simplify to find the value of x.\nx = 44\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(x + 5) = 7 is x = 44."
