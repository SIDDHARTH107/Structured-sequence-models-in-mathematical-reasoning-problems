Let $A$ and $B$ be submanifolds of $M$ given by $A=S^1 \\times \\{pt\\}$ and $B=\\{pt\\} \\times S^1$. Find the intersection number $A \\cdot B$.",
    "message_2": "To show that $A$ and $B$ intersect transversely, we need to show that for any point $p \\in A \\cap B$, the tangent spaces $T_pA$ and $T_pB$ together span the tangent space $T_pM$. Since $A$ and $B$ are of complementary dimension, we have $\\dim(A) + \\dim(B) = \\dim(M)$. In our specific case, $M = S^2 \\times S^2$ has dimension 4, and both $A$ and $B$ have dimension 1. Thus, $\\dim(A) + \\dim(B) = 1 + 1 = 2 = \\dim(M)$.\n\nNow, consider a point $p \\in A \\cap B$. Since $A = S^1 \\times \\{pt\\}$ and $B = \\{pt\\} \\times S^1$, we have $p = (x, y)$ for some $x \\in S^1$ and $y \\in S^1$. The tangent space $T_pA$ is generated by the tangent vector $\\partial/\\partial x$, and the tangent space $T_pB$ is generated by the tangent vector $\\partial/\\partial y$. Since these vectors are linearly independent, they span the tangent space $T_pM$. Thus, $A$ and $B$ intersect transversely.\n\nNow, we will calculate the intersection number $A \\cdot B$ using the Poincaré duality theorem. Let $\\alpha \\in H^1(M)$ and $\\beta \\in H^1(M)$ be the cohomology classes Poincaré dual to the homology classes represented by $A$ and $B$, respectively. Then, the intersection number $A \\cdot B$ is given by the evaluation of the cup product $\\alpha \\smile \\beta$ on the fundamental class $[M] \\in H_4(M)$, i.e., $A \\cdot B = \\langle \\alpha \\smile \\beta, [M] \\rangle$.\n\nSince $M = S^2 \\times S^2$, we have $H^1(M) = H^1(S^2) \\oplus H^1(S^2) = 0 \\oplus 0 = 0$. Therefore, both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are zero. The cup product of zero cohomology classes is also zero, so $\\alpha \\smile \\beta = 0$. Thus, the intersection number $A \\cdot B = \\langle \\alpha \\smile \\beta, [M] \\rangle = \\langle 0, [M] \\rangle = 0$.\n\nIn conclusion, the submanifolds $A$ and $B$ of $M = S^2 \\times S^2$ intersect transversely, and their intersection number is $A \\cdot B = 0$."
