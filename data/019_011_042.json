    "message_2": "In Relevance logic, we analyze the relationship between statements and their implications. In this case, we have the statement $r$: \"I will only go for a run if it is sunny outside.\" This can be written as an implication: $r: p \\rightarrow q$.\n\nGiven that $p$ is true (it is sunny outside) and $q$ is false (I will not go for a run), we can analyze the truth value of $r$.\n\nIn classical logic, the implication $p \\rightarrow q$ is false only when $p$ is true and $q$ is false. In this case, since $p$ is true and $q$ is false, the implication $r$ is false.\n\nHowever, in Relevance logic, the implication is considered true only if there is a relevant connection between the antecedent ($p$) and the consequent ($q$). In this case, there is a relevant connection between the two statements, as the decision to go for a run is directly dependent on the weather being sunny.\n\nTherefore, using Relevance logic, the truth value of $r$ is true."
