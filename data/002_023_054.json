    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\nSurface Area = 100π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 square centimeters (using the value of π ≈ 3.1416)."
