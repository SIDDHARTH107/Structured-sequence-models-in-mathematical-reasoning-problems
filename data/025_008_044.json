    "message_2": "A complex torus of complex dimension 2 can be represented as a quotient of the form T = C^2 / L, where L is a lattice of rank 4 in C^2. We want to find the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic 2-forms on T.\n\nLet's consider the universal covering map p: C^2 → T = C^2 / L. A holomorphic 2-form on T can be represented as a holomorphic 2-form ω on C^2 that is invariant under the action of the lattice L, i.e., ω(z + l) = ω(z) for all z in C^2 and l in L.\n\nHolomorphic 2-forms on C^2 are given by expressions of the form ω = f(z1, z2) dz1 ∧ dz2, where f(z1, z2) is a holomorphic function. In order for ω to be invariant under the action of L, we must have f(z1 + l1, z2 + l2) = f(z1, z2) for all (l1, l2) in L.\n\nSince f is a holomorphic function, it has a convergent power series expansion in a neighborhood of any point in C^2. We can write f(z1, z2) = ∑_{m, n} a_{mn} z1^m z2^n, where the sum is over all non-negative integers m and n, and a_{mn} are complex coefficients.\n\nThe invariance condition f(z1 + l1, z2 + l2) = f(z1, z2) implies that the power series expansion of f must be invariant under the action of L. This means that the coefficients a_{mn} must satisfy a_{mn} = a_{m+k1, n+k2} for all (k1, k2) in L.\n\nSince L is a lattice of rank 4, it has a basis of the form {(a1, 0), (a2, b2), (0, b1), (a4, b4)}, where a1, a2, b1, b2, a4, and b4 are non-zero complex numbers. The invariance condition for the coefficients a_{mn} can then be written as a system of linear equations:\n\na_{mn} = a_{m+a1, n}\na_{mn} = a_{m+a2, n+b2}\na_{mn} = a_{m, n+b1}\na_{mn} = a_{m+a4, n+b4}\n\nThis system of linear equations has a unique solution: all coefficients a_{mn} must be equal to a constant, say a_0. Thus, the only holomorphic 2-forms on T that are invariant under the action of L are of the form ω = a_0 dz1 ∧ dz2, where a_0 is a complex constant.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic 2-forms on a complex torus of complex dimension 2 is 1."
