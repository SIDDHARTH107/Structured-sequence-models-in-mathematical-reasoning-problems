    "message_1": "Given that Bob wants to send a secure message to Alice using RSA encryption, where p = 7 and q = 11 are the prime numbers used for the key creation, and e = 13 is the public key exponent, what is the corresponding private key exponent d that Bob should use?",
    "message_2": "To find the private key exponent d, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = pq, where p and q are the prime numbers.\n2. Compute the Euler's totient function φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1).\n3. Find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)), which will be the private key exponent d.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. n = pq = 7 * 11 = 77\n2. φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (7-1)(11-1) = 6 * 10 = 60\n3. Find d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1, i.e., (13 * d) % 60 = 1\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse:\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if a == 0:\n        return (b, 0, 1)\n    else:\n        g, x, y = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n        return (g, y - (b // a) * x, x)\n\ndef mod_inverse(e, phi_n):\n    g, x, _ = extended_gcd(e, phi_n)\n    if g != 1:\n        raise Exception(\"Modular inverse does not exist\")\n    else:\n        return x % phi_n\n\nd = mod_inverse(13, 60) = 37\n\nSo, the private key exponent d that Bob should use is 37."
