    "message_1": "In a game of Matching Pennies, player 1 has a biased coin that lands on heads 70% of the time and tails 30% of the time, while player 2 has a fair coin. If player 1 chooses heads, what is the probability that player 2 also chooses heads?",
    "message_2": "Since player 2 has a fair coin, the probability of player 2 choosing heads is 50% or 0.5, regardless of what player 1 chooses. So, if player 1 chooses heads, the probability that player 2 also chooses heads is still 50% or 0.5."
