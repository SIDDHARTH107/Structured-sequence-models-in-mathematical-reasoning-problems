    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game scenario, player A is given 100 points to divide with player B. Player A can choose to keep all the points (giving none to player B) or give a certain number of points to player B. If player A gives X points to player B, then player A gets to keep (100 - X) points. \n\nAssuming rationality, what is the largest number of points that player A would be willing to give to player B in order to maximize their own gain?",
    "message_2": "Assuming rationality and that player A wants to maximize their own gain, the largest number of points player A would be willing to give to player B is 0. This is because giving any points to player B would reduce player A's gain, and keeping all 100 points maximizes player A's gain."
