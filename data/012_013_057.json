    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial P(G, λ) of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction method. First, let's label the vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, and v5. The given edges are:\n\nE(G) = {(v1, v2), (v1, v3), (v1, v4), (v2, v3), (v3, v4)}\n\nNow, let's choose an edge, say (v1, v2), and apply the deletion-contraction method:\n\n1. Delete the edge (v1, v2) from the graph G, resulting in a new graph G'. The edges of G' are:\n\nE(G') = {(v1, v3), (v1, v4), (v2, v3), (v3, v4)}\n\n2. Contract the edge (v1, v2) in the graph G, resulting in a new graph G''. This means we merge vertices v1 and v2 into a single vertex, say v12, and remove any duplicate edges. The edges of G'' are:\n\nE(G'') = {(v12, v3), (v12, v4), (v3, v4)}\n\nNow we can find the chromatic polynomials for G', G'', and then use the formula:\n\nP(G, λ) = P(G', λ) - P(G'', λ)\n\nFor G', we have a graph with 5 vertices and 4 edges. It is a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is:\n\nP(G', λ) = λ(λ-1)^4\n\nFor G'', we have a graph with 4 vertices and 3 edges. It is also a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is:\n\nP(G'', λ) = λ(λ-1)^3\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial for G:\n\nP(G, λ) = P(G', λ) - P(G'', λ) = λ(λ-1)^4 - λ(λ-1)^3\n\nFactor out λ(λ-1)^3:\n\nP(G, λ) = λ(λ-1)^3(λ-1) = λ(λ-1)^4\n\nSo the chromatic polynomial for the given graph G is:\n\nP(G, λ) = λ(λ-1)^4"
