Let $H^i(X, \\mathcal{F})$ denote the $i$-th cohomology group of $\\mathcal{F}$ on $X$. Suppose $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfies the condition that $H^j(X, \\mathcal{F}) = 0$ for all $j \\neq k$ and $H^k(X, \\mathcal{F}) = \\mathbb{C}^r$ for some positive integer $r$ and some fixed integer $k$.\n\nFind the dimension of the vector space $H^d(X, \\mathcal{F})$.",
    "message_2": "Given the condition that $H^j(X, \\mathcal{F}) = 0$ for all $j \\neq k$, we can conclude that the dimension of the vector space $H^d(X, \\mathcal{F})$ is 0 when $d \\neq k$. \n\nNow, if $d = k$, then $H^d(X, \\mathcal{F}) = H^k(X, \\mathcal{F}) = \\mathbb{C}^r$. In this case, the dimension of the vector space $H^d(X, \\mathcal{F})$ is equal to the dimension of $\\mathbb{C}^r$, which is $r$.\n\nIn summary, the dimension of the vector space $H^d(X, \\mathcal{F})$ is 0 when $d \\neq k$ and $r$ when $d = k$."
