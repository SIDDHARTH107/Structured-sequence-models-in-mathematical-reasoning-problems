    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the given elliptic curve, we first need to compute its invariants. The given equation is already in the Weierstrass form:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$\n\nwith $A = 0$ and $B = 1$. Now, we compute the discriminant $\\Delta$ and the $j$-invariant $j$:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2) = -16(27) = -432$\n\n$j = 1728 \\frac{4A^3}{\\Delta} = 1728 \\frac{0}{-432} = 0$\n\nSince $\\Delta \\neq 0$, the curve is non-singular, and as $j = 0$, the curve is already in the minimal form. Thus, the minimal model of $V$ is the curve itself:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + x$\n\nNow, we need to find the rational points on this curve. We can use the method of descent to find the rational points. First, we note that the point $(0,0)$ is a rational point on the curve. Then, we can look for other rational points by considering lines with rational slopes passing through $(0,0)$. Let the line be:\n\n$y = mx$\n\nSubstituting this into the curve equation, we get:\n\n$(mx)^2 = x^3 + x$\n\nRearranging and factoring, we get:\n\n$x^3 - m^2x^2 + x = x(x^2 - m^2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThis cubic equation has one rational root, $x = 0$, which corresponds to the point $(0,0)$. The other two roots are conjugate and can be found using Vieta's formulas:\n\n$x_1 + x_2 = m^2$\n\n$x_1x_2 = 1$\n\nThus, if we can find a rational number $m$ such that $m^2 - 1$ is a square, then we can find another rational point on the curve. For example, if we take $m = 1$, we get $x_1 + x_2 = 1^2 = 1$ and $x_1x_2 = 1$. This gives us the rational point $(1,1)$ on the curve.\n\nIn general, finding all rational points on an elliptic curve is a difficult problem. However, for this specific curve, we can use the method of descent to find more rational points by considering lines with rational slopes passing through the known rational points."
