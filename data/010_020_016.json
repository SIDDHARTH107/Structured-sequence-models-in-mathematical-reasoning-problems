    "message_1": "Let's say we have a 3-dimensional torus (a doughnut shape) with a radius of 2 meters. Using Floer homology, what is the number of distinct closed geodesics on the torus?",
    "message_2": "Floer homology is a powerful tool in symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology, but it is not the most direct way to approach the problem of counting closed geodesics on a 3-dimensional torus. Instead, we can use the concept of homotopy classes to determine the number of distinct closed geodesics.\n\nA 3-dimensional torus can be represented as T^3 = S^1 x S^1 x S^1, where S^1 is the circle. Closed geodesics on the torus correspond to homotopy classes of loops. In the case of the 3-dimensional torus, these homotopy classes can be represented by integer triples (p, q, r), where p, q, and r are integers corresponding to the number of times the loop wraps around each of the three S^1 factors.\n\nThere are infinitely many distinct closed geodesics on the 3-dimensional torus, as there are infinitely many integer triples (p, q, r). Each triple corresponds to a unique homotopy class and thus a distinct closed geodesic."
