    "message_2": "Let's first analyze the action of the transformations on the monomials of degree 4. We have the following monomials:\n\n1. x^4\n2. x^3y\n3. x^2y^2\n4. xy^3\n5. y^4\n\nNow, let's apply the transformations to these monomials and see how they change.\n\nFor the first transformation (x,y) → (x + 2, y):\n\n1. (x+2)^4 = x^4 + 16x^3 + 96x^2 + 256x + 256\n2. (x+2)^3y = x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 12xy^3 + 8y^4\n3. (x+2)^2y^2 = x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + 4y^4\n4. (x+2)y^3 = xy^3 + 2y^4\n5. y^4\n\nFor the second transformation (x,y) → (-x, y):\n\n1. (-x)^4 = x^4\n2. (-x)^3y = -x^3y\n3. (-x)^2y^2 = x^2y^2\n4. (-x)y^3 = -xy^3\n5. y^4\n\nNow, let's find the G-invariant polynomials, which are the polynomials that remain unchanged under the action of G:\n\n1. x^4: Not invariant under the first transformation.\n2. x^3y: Not invariant under either transformation.\n3. x^2y^2: Invariant under both transformations.\n4. xy^3: Not invariant under either transformation.\n5. y^4: Invariant under both transformations.\n\nThus, the G-invariant polynomials of degree 4 on X are x^2y^2 and y^4. Therefore, the dimensions of the vector space of G-invariant polynomials of degree 4 on X is 2."
