    "message_1": "A group of order 60 has a subgroup of order 10. How many subgroups of order 10 does this group have, and which of the three possible isomorphisms (C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60) does this group have?",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 60, and let H be a subgroup of order 10. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 5 and divides 12 (since 60 = 5^1 * 12). Therefore, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G is either 1 or 6. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 2 and divides 15 (since 60 = 2^2 * 15). Therefore, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is either 1, 3, or 15.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H of order 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, H must contain a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2 and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, and let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. By the Sylow Theorems, there exists a g in G such that gPg^(-1) = Q. Then, the subgroup generated by P and gQg^(-1) is a subgroup of order 10, since the orders of P and gQg^(-1) are relatively prime. Therefore, there must be at least as many subgroups of order 10 as there are Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup (i.e., the number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 1), then G must be isomorphic to C60, since there is only one group of order 60 with a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is the cyclic group of order 60. In this case, there is only one subgroup of order 10, namely H.\n\nIf there are six Sylow 5-subgroups, then G cannot be isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2, since both of these groups have a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. In this case, there are six subgroups of order 10, one for each Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is isomorphic to C60, there is only one subgroup of order 10. If G is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, there are six subgroups of order 10. If G is isomorphic to A5 × C2, it cannot have a subgroup of order 10, which contradicts the given information."
