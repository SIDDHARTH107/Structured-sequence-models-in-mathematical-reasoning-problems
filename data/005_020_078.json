    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of getting a sum of 7 or 11 in two rolls of a fair six-sided dice using Monte Carlo simulation, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Simulate the process of rolling two dice 1000 times.\n2. Count the number of times the sum of the two dice is either 7 or 11.\n3. Divide the count by the total number of simulations (1000) to get the estimated probability.\n\nHere's a simple Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_dice():\n    return random.randint(1, 6)\n\ndef is_sum_7_or_11(dice1, dice2):\n    return dice1 + dice2 in [7, 11]\n\nsimulations = 1000\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(simulations):\n    dice1 = roll_dice()\n    dice2 = roll_dice()\n    if is_sum_7_or_11(dice1, dice2):\n        count += 1\n\nestimated_probability = count / simulations\nprint(estimated_probability)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you an estimated probability of getting a sum of 7 or 11 in two rolls of a fair six-sided dice. Note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the code due to the random nature of the simulation."
