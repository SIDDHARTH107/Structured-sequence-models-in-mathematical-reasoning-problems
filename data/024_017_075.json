    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve C, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C at any point t. We can do this by taking the derivative of the curve C with respect to t:\n\ndx/dt = -sin(t)\ndy/dt = 2cos(t)\ndz/dt = 2\n\nSo, the tangent vector T(t) = (-sin(t), 2cos(t), 2).\n\nNow, we need to find the covariant derivative of the vector v with respect to the tangent vector T(t). The covariant derivative is given by:\n\nDv/Dt = (dv/dt) - Γ(v, T(t))\n\nwhere Γ is the Christoffel symbol. Since the curve C is embedded in the Euclidean space, the Christoffel symbols are all zero. Therefore, the covariant derivative is simply the derivative of v with respect to t:\n\nDv/Dt = (0, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we integrate the covariant derivative with respect to t along the curve C to find the parallel transport of the vector v:\n\nv(t) = v(0) + ∫(Dv/Dt) dt\n\nSince Dv/Dt = (0, 0, 0), the integral is simply:\n\nv(t) = v(0) = (1, 2, 3)\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve C is the constant vector (1, 2, 3)."
