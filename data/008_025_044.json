    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrix. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n3x - 2y = 7\n\nNow, we have two identical equations:\n\n3x - 2y = 7\n3x - 2y = 7\n\nSince both equations are the same, we can eliminate one of them and solve for one variable. Let's solve for x:\n\n3x - 2y = 7\n\nAdd 2y to both sides:\n\n3x = 7 + 2y\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx = (7 + 2y) / 3\n\nNow we have x in terms of y. Since both equations are the same, there is an infinite number of solutions that satisfy the system of equations. The solution is a dependent system, and the equations represent the same line."
