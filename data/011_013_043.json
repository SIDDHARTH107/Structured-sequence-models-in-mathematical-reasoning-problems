    "message_1": "A math teacher has 6 red pens, 4 blue pens, and 5 green pens. How many ways can the teacher choose two pens of different colors to give to a student?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose. However, since we are choosing two pens of different colors, we can simply multiply the number of pens of each color by the number of pens of the other colors and then add the results.\n\nThe teacher can choose a red pen and a blue pen, a red pen and a green pen, or a blue pen and a green pen. So, we have:\n\n1. Red and Blue: 6 red pens * 4 blue pens = 24 combinations\n2. Red and Green: 6 red pens * 5 green pens = 30 combinations\n3. Blue and Green: 4 blue pens * 5 green pens = 20 combinations\n\nNow, add the combinations together: 24 + 30 + 20 = 74 ways.\n\nThe teacher can choose two pens of different colors to give to a student in 74 different ways."
