    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products - Type A and Type B. The profit per unit for Type A is $20 and for Type B is $30. The factory has a limited production capacity of 500 units per day. Type A products require 2 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time, while Type B products require 4 hours of labor and 5 hours of machine time. The factory has a labor supply of 800 hours and a machine supply of 1000 hours per day. What is the maximum profit per day the factory can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Type A products and y be the number of Type B products produced per day. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 500\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 800\n3. Machine constraint: 4x + 5y ≤ 1000\n\nFirst, we will solve the labor constraint for y:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 800\ny ≤ (800 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ 200 - 0.5x\n\nNext, we will solve the machine constraint for y:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 1000\ny ≤ (1000 - 4x) / 5\ny ≤ 200 - 0.8x\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by plotting these constraints on a graph. The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, the feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 200), (200, 100), and (400, 0).\n\nWe will now evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\nP(0, 200) = 20(0) + 30(200) = $6,000\nP(200, 100) = 20(200) + 30(100) = $7,000\nP(400, 0) = 20(400) + 30(0) = $8,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (400, 0), with a profit of $8,000 per day. Therefore, the factory should produce 400 units of Type A products and 0 units of Type B products to maximize its profit."
