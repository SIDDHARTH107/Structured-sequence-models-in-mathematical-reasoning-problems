    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 19\n3x - 5y + 6z = 5\n5x + 9y - 8z = -29\n\nHowever, due to the presence of noise in the data, each coefficient could be off by as much as 0.1. Given this uncertainty, find the solution (x, y, z) that best satisfies the system of equations using the least-squares method.",
    "message_2": "To find the solution (x, y, z) that best satisfies the system of equations using the least-squares method, we can represent the system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 3 -5  6 |\n    | 5  9 -8 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  19  |\n    |   5  |\n    | -29  |\n\nThe least-squares solution can be found using the normal equation: A^T * A * x = A^T * b, where A^T is the transpose of matrix A.\n\nFirst, calculate A^T:\n\nA^T = |  2  3  5 |\n      |  3 -5  9 |\n      |  4  6 -8 |\n\nNext, calculate A^T * A:\n\nA^T * A = |  38  -10  -6 |\n          | -10   115 -102|\n          |  -6  -102 116 |\n\nNow, calculate A^T * b:\n\nA^T * b = |  24  |\n          | -190 |\n          |  194 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of linear equations:\n\n38x - 10y - 6z = 24\n-10x + 115y - 102z = -190\n-6x - 102y + 116z = 194\n\nUsing any method of your choice (e.g., Gaussian elimination, matrix inversion, etc.), we can find the solution:\n\nx ≈ 1.0\ny ≈ 2.0\nz ≈ 3.0\n\nSo, the least-squares solution for the given system of equations is (x, y, z) ≈ (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)."
