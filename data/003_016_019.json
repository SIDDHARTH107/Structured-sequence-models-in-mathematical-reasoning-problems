    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift applied to the function. In the given function f(x) = 2sin(3x + π/4), the phase shift can be found by looking at the term inside the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function with phase shift is f(x) = A sin(B(x - C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, we have f(x) = 2sin(3x + π/4). To find the phase shift, we need to rewrite the function in the general form:\n\n2sin(3x + π/4) = 2sin(3(x + π/12))\n\nComparing this with the general form, we can see that the phase shift C is π/12.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x + π/4) is π/12."
