    "message_1": "A store offers discounts on purchases according to the following rule: customers who spend more than $100 get a 25% discount, while customers who spend less than $100 get a 10% discount. Using fuzzy logic, determine the amount of discount a customer would receive if they spent $90 at the store.",
    "message_2": "Using fuzzy logic, we can interpolate the discount rate for a customer who spends $90 at the store. Since $90 is close to $100, the discount rate should be closer to the 25% discount than the 10% discount.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference between the two spending limits: $100 - $90 = $10.\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the two discount rates: 25% - 10% = 15%.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the ratio of the spending difference to the total range of spending limits: $10 / $100 = 0.1.\n\nFinally, we'll multiply this ratio by the difference in discount rates and add it to the lower discount rate: 0.1 * 15% + 10% = 1.5% + 10% = 11.5%.\n\nSo, using fuzzy logic, a customer who spends $90 at the store would receive an 11.5% discount."
