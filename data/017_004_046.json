    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 25, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. In this case, the order of the group is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2). \n\nFor a group of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, there is exactly one Sylow p-subgroup for each divisor of n. In this case, the divisors of 2 (the exponent of 5) are 1 and 2. Therefore, there are two Sylow 5-subgroups to consider.\n\n1. The first Sylow 5-subgroup has order 5 (5^1). This subgroup is cyclic, as all groups of prime order are cyclic. The group generated by this subgroup has order 5 and is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C_5 or Z_5.\n\n2. The second Sylow 5-subgroup has order 25 (5^2). This subgroup can either be cyclic or not. If it is cyclic, the group generated by this subgroup has order 25 and is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 25, denoted as C_25 or Z_25. If it is not cyclic, it must be a non-abelian group. However, all groups of order p^2 (where p is a prime number) are abelian, so this case is not possible.\n\nTherefore, there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 25: the cyclic groups of order 5 and 25, denoted as C_5 and C_25."
