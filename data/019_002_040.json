Alice has one more dollar than Bob. If Carol has $5, how much money does Alice have?\"\n\nHint: Use predicates to represent the people and their monetary values. For example, A(x) could mean \"x is Alice\" and B(x) could mean \"x is Bob\". You can then use additional predicates to represent the monetary values.",
