The fluid is driven by a pressure difference of $100$ Pa between the two ends of the pipe. Assuming laminar flow, use the Navier-Stokes equations to determine the volumetric flow rate $Q$ of the fluid through the pipe.",
    "message_2": "For laminar flow in a circular pipe, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to determine the volumetric flow rate $Q$. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is given by:\n\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the pipe, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference between the two ends of the pipe, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $L$ is the length of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius $R$ of the pipe. Since the diameter $D = 0.1$ m, the radius is:\n\n$$R = \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the pressure difference $\\Delta P$. We are given that the pressure difference is $100$ Pa, so:\n\n$$\\Delta P = 100\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n\nWe are also given the dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 0.01$ Pa$\\cdot$s.\n\nTo find the volumetric flow rate $Q$, we need to know the length $L$ of the pipe. However, the problem statement does not provide this information. We can still express the volumetric flow rate $Q$ in terms of the length $L$:\n\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi (0.05)^4 (100)}{8 (0.01) L}$$\n\n$$Q = \\frac{3.14 \\times 6.25 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 100}{0.08L}$$\n\n$$Q = \\frac{1.9625 \\times 10^{-3}}{L}\\,\\text{m}^3\\text{/s}$$\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is inversely proportional to the length $L$ of the pipe. To find the exact value of $Q$, we would need to know the length $L$."
