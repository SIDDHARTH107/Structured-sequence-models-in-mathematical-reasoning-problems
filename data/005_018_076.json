    "message_1": "A pharmaceutical company has conducted a clinical trial for a new drug that supposedly increases the survival rate of cancer patients. In the trial, 500 cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups: one group received the new drug and the other group received a placebo. After a certain period of time, it was found that 150 patients who received the new drug had survived, while 120 of those who received the placebo survived. Using survival analysis techniques, determine if the new drug significantly increases the survival rate of cancer patients at a 5% significance level.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the new drug significantly increases the survival rate of cancer patients at a 5% significance level, we will perform a hypothesis test using the chi-square test for independence.\n\nLet's define the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1):\nH0: The new drug does not significantly increase the survival rate of cancer patients.\nH1: The new drug significantly increases the survival rate of cancer patients.\n\nFirst, let's create a contingency table:\n\n|           | New Drug | Placebo | Total |\n|-----------|----------|---------|-------|\n| Survived  | 150      | 120     | 270   |\n| Not Survived | 350      | 380     | 730   |\n| Total     | 500      | 500     | 1000  |\n\nNow, we will calculate the expected values for each cell:\n\nExpected value for Survived with New Drug = (Total Survived * Total New Drug) / Total Patients\n= (270 * 500) / 1000\n= 135\n\nExpected value for Survived with Placebo = (Total Survived * Total Placebo) / Total Patients\n= (270 * 500) / 1000\n= 135\n\nExpected value for Not Survived with New Drug = (Total Not Survived * Total New Drug) / Total Patients\n= (730 * 500) / 1000\n= 365\n\nExpected value for Not Survived with Placebo = (Total Not Survived * Total Placebo) / Total Patients\n= (730 * 500) / 1000\n= 365\n\nNow, we will calculate the chi-square test statistic:\n\nχ² = Σ [(Observed - Expected)² / Expected]\n\nχ² = [(150 - 135)² / 135] + [(120 - 135)² / 135] + [(350 - 365)² / 365] + [(380 - 365)² / 365]\n= (225 / 135) + (225 / 135) + (225 / 365) + (225 / 365)\n= 1.67 + 1.67 + 0.62 + 0.62\n= 4.58\n\nNow, we will compare the chi-square test statistic to the critical value at a 5% significance level with 1 degree of freedom (df = (2-1)(2-1) = 1). The critical value for χ² with 1 degree of freedom at a 5% significance level is 3.84.\n\nSince the calculated chi-square test statistic (4.58) is greater than the critical value (3.84), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that the new drug significantly increases the survival rate of cancer patients at a 5% significance level."
