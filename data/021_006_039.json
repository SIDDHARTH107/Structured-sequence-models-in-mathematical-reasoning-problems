    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we first need to discretize the domain Ω and approximate the solution u(x, t) using basis functions. Since we are asked to provide a plot of the solution at t = 0.5, we will focus on the spatial discretization and use a mesh size of h = 0.1.\n\n1. Discretize the domain Ω:\nDivide the domain Ω = [0,1]×[0,1] into a grid of equally spaced points with a mesh size of h = 0.1. This will result in a grid of 11x11 points.\n\n2. Approximate the solution u(x, t) using basis functions:\nWe will use the standard linear basis functions for the FEM. Let N be the number of nodes in the grid, and let {ϕ_i(x)} be the set of basis functions. We can approximate the solution u(x, t) as:\n\nu(x, t) ≈ ∑(U_i(t) * ϕ_i(x))\n\nwhere U_i(t) are the coefficients to be determined.\n\n3. Weak formulation and time discretization:\nTo obtain the weak formulation, we multiply the given PDE by a test function v(x) and integrate over the domain Ω. Then, we apply the time discretization using the backward Euler method. This will result in a system of linear equations of the form:\n\nM * (U^(n+1) - U^n) + A * U^(n+1) = F^n\n\nwhere M is the mass matrix, A is the stiffness matrix, U^n and U^(n+1) are the coefficients at time steps n and n+1, and F^n is the forcing term at time step n.\n\n4. Assemble the matrices and solve the linear system:\nAssemble the mass matrix M and stiffness matrix A using the basis functions and the given coefficient k(t). Also, compute the forcing term F^n using the given function f(x, t). Then, solve the linear system for the coefficients U^(n+1).\n\n5. Compute the solution at t = 0.5:\nSince we are interested in the solution at t = 0.5, we need to perform the time-stepping until we reach t = 0.5. Once we have the coefficients U^(n+1) at t = 0.5, we can compute the solution u(x, t) at t = 0.5 as:\n\nu(x, 0.5) ≈ ∑(U_i(0.5) * ϕ_i(x))\n\n6. Plot the solution:\nFinally, we can plot the solution u(x, t) at t = 0.5 using the computed coefficients U_i(0.5) and the basis functions ϕ_i(x).\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the FEM and the plot generation would require using a programming language or software like MATLAB, Python, or FEniCS. The steps provided here outline the general approach to solving the given PDE using the FEM."
