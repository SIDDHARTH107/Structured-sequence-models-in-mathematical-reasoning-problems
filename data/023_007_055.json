    "message_1": "The voltage wave form of a signal is given by, \n\nf(t) = 3 cos(5000 π t) + 2 sin(10000 π t) + 10 cos(20000 π t)\n\nUsing the Fourier transform, find the frequency content of the signal and its amplitude at each frequency.",
    "message_2": "The given signal f(t) is already in the time domain with sinusoidal components. We can directly read the frequency content and amplitudes from the equation without needing to apply the Fourier transform.\n\nf(t) = 3 cos(5000 π t) + 2 sin(10000 π t) + 10 cos(20000 π t)\n\nThe frequency content of the signal can be found by looking at the angular frequencies (ω) in the equation. The angular frequency is related to the frequency (f) by the formula ω = 2πf.\n\n1. The first term has an angular frequency of 5000π, so its frequency is:\nf1 = (5000π) / (2π) = 2500 Hz\n\n2. The second term has an angular frequency of 10000π, so its frequency is:\nf2 = (10000π) / (2π) = 5000 Hz\n\n3. The third term has an angular frequency of 20000π, so its frequency is:\nf3 = (20000π) / (2π) = 10000 Hz\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude at each frequency:\n\n1. The amplitude of the first term (cosine term) is 3.\n2. The amplitude of the second term (sine term) is 2.\n3. The amplitude of the third term (cosine term) is 10.\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal is 2500 Hz, 5000 Hz, and 10000 Hz, with amplitudes of 3, 2, and 10, respectively."
