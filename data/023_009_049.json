    "message_2": "To solve the boundary value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier sine series of the given function f(x) = x. The Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2/L) * ∫[0 to L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] * sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere L = 1 in our case.\n\nFor f(x) = x, the Fourier sine series coefficients are:\n\na_n = (2/1) * ∫[0 to 1] x * sin(nπx) dx\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(nπx) dx\nThen, du = dx and v = -(1/nπ)cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[0 to 1] x * sin(nπx) dx = -x(1/nπ)cos(nπx) |[0 to 1] + (1/nπ)∫[0 to 1] cos(nπx) dx\n\nThe integral of cos(nπx) is (1/nπ)sin(nπx). So,\n\na_n = -[(1/nπ)cos(nπ) - (1/nπ)cos(0)] + (1/n²π²)[sin(nπ) - sin(0)]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ) = 0, we have:\n\na_n = -[(1/nπ)((-1)^n - 1)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier sine series for f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = ∑[-(2/nπ)((-1)^n - 1) * sin(nπx)]\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier sine series to find the solution u(x) to the boundary value problem. The differential equation is:\n\nu''(x) + u(x) = f(x)\n\nTaking the second derivative of the Fourier sine series, we get:\n\nu''(x) = ∑[-(2/nπ)((-1)^n - 1) * (-n²π²) * sin(nπx)]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for u''(x) and f(x) into the differential equation:\n\n∑[-(2/nπ)((-1)^n - 1) * (-n²π²) * sin(nπx)] + ∑[-(2/nπ)((-1)^n - 1) * sin(nπx)] = ∑[-(2/nπ)((-1)^n - 1) * sin(nπx)]\n\nSince the equation holds for all x, the coefficients of the sine functions must be equal. Thus, we have:\n\n(-n²π² + 1) * u_n = -2/nπ * ((-1)^n - 1)\n\nSolving for u_n:\n\nu_n = 2/nπ * ((-1)^n - 1) / (n²π² - 1)\n\nNow, we can write the solution u(x) as a Fourier sine series:\n\nu(x) = ∑[2/nπ * ((-1)^n - 1) / (n²π² - 1) * sin(nπx)]\n\nThis is the solution to the boundary value problem."
