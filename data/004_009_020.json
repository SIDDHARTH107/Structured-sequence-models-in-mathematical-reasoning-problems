    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 4x)(5x - 2) using the product rule, we first need to find the derivatives of the two factors:\n\nLet u(x) = 3x^2 + 4x and v(x) = 5x - 2.\n\nNow, find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(3x^2 + 4x)/dx = 6x + 4\nv'(x) = d(5x - 2)/dx = 5\n\nNow, apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (6x + 4)(5x - 2) + (3x^2 + 4x)(5)\n\nNow, we need to find f'(2):\n\nf'(2) = (6(2) + 4)(5(2) - 2) + (3(2)^2 + 4(2))(5)\nf'(2) = (12 + 4)(10 - 2) + (12 + 8)(5)\nf'(2) = (16)(8) + (20)(5)\nf'(2) = 128 + 100\nf'(2) = 228\n\nSo, f'(2) = 228."
