    "message_1": "A message encrypted with the Vigenere cipher using a keyword of length 5 contains 1000 characters. If the index of coincidence of the ciphertext is 0.065, what is the most likely length of the keyword used for encryption?",
    "message_2": "To find the most likely length of the keyword used for encryption, we can use the Friedman test, which is based on the index of coincidence (IC). The formula for the Friedman test is:\n\nK = (0.027 * N) / ((0.065 - 0.0385) * (1 - (1 / L)) + 0.0385)\n\nWhere K is the keyword length, N is the total number of characters in the ciphertext, and L is the index of coincidence of the ciphertext.\n\nGiven the information in the problem, we have:\n\nN = 1000\nIC = 0.065\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nK = (0.027 * 1000) / ((0.065 - 0.0385) * (1 - (1 / L)) + 0.0385)\n\nK = 27 / ((0.0265) * (1 - (1 / L)) + 0.0385)\n\nNow, we need to solve for L. Since we know that the keyword length is 5, we can use trial and error to find the value of L that gives us a keyword length close to 5.\n\nTrying L = 5:\n\nK = 27 / ((0.0265) * (1 - (1 / 5)) + 0.0385)\nK = 27 / ((0.0265) * (4 / 5) + 0.0385)\nK = 27 / (0.0212 + 0.0385)\nK = 27 / 0.0597\nK = 4.52 (approximately)\n\nSince the result is close to 5, we can conclude that the most likely length of the keyword used for encryption is 5."
