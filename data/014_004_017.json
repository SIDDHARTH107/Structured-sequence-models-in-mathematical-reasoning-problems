    "message_2": "First, we need to find the point 2P on the elliptic curve E. To do this, we will use the formula for point doubling:\n\nIf P = (x1, y1), then 2P = (x3, y3), where\nx3 = (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) - x1 - x1 (mod p)\ny3 = (x1 - x3) * (x1 + x3 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) - y1 (mod p)\n\nIn our case, P = (3, 6), a = 2, and p = 7.\n\nx3 = (3(3^2) + 2) * (2(6))^(-1) - 3 - 3 (mod 7)\nx3 = (27 + 2) * 12^(-1) - 6 (mod 7)\nx3 = 29 * 12^(-1) - 6 (mod 7)\nx3 = 1 * 5 - 6 (mod 7)\nx3 = 5 - 6 (mod 7)\nx3 = 6 (mod 7)\n\ny3 = (3 - 6) * (3 + 6 + 2) * (2(6))^(-1) - 6 (mod 7)\ny3 = (-3) * (11) * 12^(-1) - 6 (mod 7)\ny3 = (-3) * 4 * 5 - 6 (mod 7)\ny3 = -60 - 6 (mod 7)\ny3 = -66 (mod 7)\ny3 = 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, 2P = (6, 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the point Q on E such that 2P + Q = O. Since we know that 2P = (6, 1), we can rewrite this equation as Q = O - 2P.\n\nIn elliptic curve arithmetic, the point at infinity O acts as the identity element. So, to find Q, we need to find the point that, when added to 2P, results in O. This is the inverse of 2P.\n\nThe inverse of a point (x, y) on an elliptic curve is (x, -y). Therefore, the inverse of 2P = (6, 1) is (6, -1) or (6, 6) since we are working in F_7.\n\nSo, Q = (6, 6)."
