    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)\n\nwhere V(x, y) is the potential energy function given by:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (a * x^2 + b * y^2) + c * (x^2 * y - y^3 / 3)\n\nFor a stable equilibrium point, we need to find the critical points of the potential energy function V(x, y) by setting its partial derivatives with respect to x and y to zero:\n\n∂V/∂x = a * x + 2 * c * x * y = 0\n∂V/∂y = b * y + c * (x^2 - y^2) = 0\n\nGiven the parameters a = 1/2, b = 1/3, and c = 1/4, we have:\n\n(1/2) * x + (1/2) * x * y = 0\n(1/3) * y + (1/4) * (x^2 - y^2) = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find two equilibrium points:\n\n1. (x, y) = (0, 0)\n2. (x, y) = (±√(3/5), ±√(2/5))\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibrium points, we need to analyze the Hessian matrix of the potential energy function V(x, y) at these points. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\nH_V = | a + 2 * c * y, 2 * c * x | \n      | 2 * c * x, b - 2 * c * y |\n\nFor the first equilibrium point (0, 0), the Hessian matrix is:\n\nH_V(0, 0) = | 1/2, 0 |\n            | 0, 1/3 |\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are λ1 = 1/2 and λ2 = 1/3, both of which are positive. Therefore, the equilibrium point (0, 0) is a stable equilibrium point.\n\nFor the second equilibrium point (±√(3/5), ±√(2/5)), the Hessian matrix is:\n\nH_V(±√(3/5), ±√(2/5)) = | -1/10, ±2√(6)/5 |\n                         | ±2√(6)/5, 1/10 |\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are complex with positive real parts, indicating that these equilibrium points are unstable.\n\nThus, the stable equilibrium point in the Henon-Heiles system with the given parameters is (x, y) = (0, 0)."
