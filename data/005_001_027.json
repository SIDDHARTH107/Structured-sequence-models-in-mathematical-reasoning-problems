    "message_1": "A cereal company claims that the mean weight of their cereal boxes is 500 grams. To test this claim, a student selects a random sample of 36 cereal boxes and finds that the mean weight of the sample is 495 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. Can the student reject the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean weight of the cereal boxes is 500 grams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean weight is not 500 grams.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (495 - 500) / (10 / sqrt(36))\n\nt = -5 / (10 / 6)\n\nt = -5 / (1.67)\n\nt = -3\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 35 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately Â±2.03.\n\nSince the calculated t-score of -3 is less than the critical t-value of -2.03, we reject the null hypothesis at a 0.05 significance level. This means that the student has enough evidence to reject the company's claim that the mean weight of their cereal boxes is 500 grams."
