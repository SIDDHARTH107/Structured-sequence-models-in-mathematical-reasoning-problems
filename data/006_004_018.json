    "message_1": "A game of chance involves a spinner with 8 equally-sized sections, numbered 1 through 8. If you bet on the number 4 and the spinner lands on that section, you win. What is the probability of winning this game in a single spin?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 8 equally-sized sections and you are betting on one specific number (4), the probability of winning the game in a single spin is 1 out of 8. In fractional form, this is written as 1/8."
