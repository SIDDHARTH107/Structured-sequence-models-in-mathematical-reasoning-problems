    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given first-order differential equation, we need to integrate both sides with respect to x.\n\ndy/dx = 6x - 8\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(dy) = ∫(6x - 8) dx\n\ny = 3x^2 - 8x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we are given the initial condition y(0) = 2. We can use this to find the value of C.\n\ny(0) = 3(0)^2 - 8(0) + C = 2\n\nC = 2\n\nSo, the general solution of the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 2"
