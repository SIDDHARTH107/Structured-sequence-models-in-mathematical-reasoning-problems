The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nBy comparing the elements in sets A and B, we can see that the common elements are 3 and 9.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 9}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B. A set C is a subset of a set D if every element of C is also an element of D. In other words, if x ∈ C, then x ∈ D.\n\nLet's check if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element of A.\n3 ∈ A and 9 ∈ A\n\nSince both elements of A ∩ B are also elements of A, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element of B.\n3 ∈ B and 9 ∈ B\n\nSince both elements of A ∩ B are also elements of B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of sets A and B, A ∩ B, is a subset of both sets A and B."
