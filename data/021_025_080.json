    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The cost of producing A and B are $200 and $300, respectively. The company has a monthly budget of $50,000 to spend on the production of these products. The profit of A and B is $400 and $500, respectively. How many units of A and B should the company produce to maximize its profit, using the whale optimization algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve optimization problems, such as the one presented here. However, as an AI language model, I cannot directly implement the WOA. Instead, I will provide a solution using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 400x + 500y\n\nConstraints (production costs and budget):\n200x + 300y <= 50,000 (budget constraint)\nx >= 0 (non-negative production of A)\ny >= 0 (non-negative production of B)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can find the feasible region and identify the vertices. Then, we can evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. Rearrange the budget constraint equation:\ny <= (50,000 - 200x) / 300\n\n2. Find the vertices of the feasible region:\n- (x, y) = (0, 0) [Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0]\n- (x, y) = (0, 166.67) [Intersection of x = 0 and y = (50,000 - 200x) / 300]\n- (x, y) = (250, 0) [Intersection of y = 0 and y = (50,000 - 200x) / 300]\n\n3. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n- P(0, 0) = 400(0) + 500(0) = 0\n- P(0, 166.67) = 400(0) + 500(166.67) = 83,335\n- P(250, 0) = 400(250) + 500(0) = 100,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $100,000, which occurs when the company produces 250 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
