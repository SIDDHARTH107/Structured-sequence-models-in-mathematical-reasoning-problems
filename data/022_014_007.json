    "message_2": "A harmonic function u(x, y) satisfies Laplace's equation:\n\n∇²u = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nWe are given the boundary condition u(x, 0) = x². To find the value of u(0, 1/2), we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). Then Laplace's equation becomes:\n\n(∂²X/∂x²)Y + X(∂²Y/∂y²) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by XY:\n\n(1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) + (1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²) = 0\n\nSince the left side is a function of x only and the right side is a function of y only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let this constant be -k²:\n\n(1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) = k²\n(1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²) = -k²\n\nSolve these ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) - k²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) + k²Y(y) = 0\n\nThe general solutions are:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx)\nY(y) = C*cosh(ky) + D*sinh(ky)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary condition u(x, 0) = x²:\n\nx² = (A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx))(C*cosh(0) + D*sinh(0))\nx² = (A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx))(C)\n\nSince this must hold for all x, we have:\n\nA = 0, B = 1, C = x²\n\nSo, u(x, y) = x²*sin(kx)*sinh(ky)\n\nNow, we use the fact that u(x, y) is defined over the region x² + y² < 1. This implies that u(x, y) must be bounded as y → ±∞. The only way this can happen is if k = 0. Thus, u(x, y) = x²*sin(0)*sinh(0) = 0 for all x and y.\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the given boundary condition u(x, 0) = x². Therefore, there is no harmonic function u(x, y) that satisfies the given conditions."
