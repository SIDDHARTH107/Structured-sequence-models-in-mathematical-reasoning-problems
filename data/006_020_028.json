    "message_1": "In a community, it is estimated that 30% of the families have at least one pet. If there are 400 families in the community, what is the probability that at least 120 families have a pet?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, families with pets) out of n trials (total families)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 30% or 0.3)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 400 families)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 120 families with pets)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 120 families having a pet, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 120, 121, 122, ..., 400.\n\nP(X ≥ 120) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 120 to 400\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The normal approximation uses the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution, which are:\n\nμ = n * p = 400 * 0.3 = 120\nσ = √(n * p * (1-p)) = √(400 * 0.3 * 0.7) ≈ 8.37\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z) to approximate the probability:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nSince we want the probability of at least 120 families having a pet, we will find the Z-score for 119.5 (using the continuity correction):\n\nZ = (119.5 - 120) / 8.37 ≈ -0.06\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal table or calculator to find the probability of having a Z-score greater than -0.06:\n\nP(Z > -0.06) ≈ 0.5239\n\nSo, the probability that at least 120 families have a pet is approximately 52.39%."
