    "message_2": "Since John and Sarah must be on the committee together, we only need to choose one more member from the remaining four people (Mary, Tom, David, and Jane). The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 4 (the number of remaining people to choose from) and k = 1 (we need to choose one more person). So the formula becomes:\n\nC(4, 1) = 4! / (1!(4-1)!) = 4! / (1!3!) = (4*3*2*1) / (1*(3*2*1)) = 4\n\nSo there are 4 different committees that can be formed under these conditions."
