    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the length of the base of an isosceles triangle with a perimeter of 30 cm and each equal side measuring 10 cm. What is the length of the base of this isosceles triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the base of the isosceles triangle, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:\n\nPerimeter = Side1 + Side2 + Base\n\nWe know the perimeter is 30 cm, and each equal side measures 10 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n30 = 10 + 10 + Base\n\nNow, we can solve for the base:\n\n30 = 20 + Base\n\nBase = 30 - 20\n\nBase = 10 cm\n\nThe length of the base of this isosceles triangle is 10 cm."
