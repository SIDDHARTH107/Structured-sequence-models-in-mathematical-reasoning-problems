    "message_1": "Assume that a group of 5 volunteers are needed for a community event to be successful. Each volunteer can contribute $50 to the event, but if fewer than 5 volunteers show up, the event will not happen and all donations will be refunded. If volunteers are not sure whether others will show up, they may choose to not show up. If one volunteer shows up and the others don't, that volunteer will get all the credit for making the event happen. If two or more volunteers show up, they will share the credit equally. What is the best decision for each volunteer to make when deciding whether or not to show up for the event?",
    "message_2": "The best decision for each volunteer depends on their individual preferences and priorities. If their main goal is to ensure the success of the community event, then the best decision would be for all volunteers to show up and contribute their $50. This way, the event will happen, and they will share the credit equally.\n\nHowever, if a volunteer's main goal is to maximize their personal credit, they may choose not to show up, hoping that only one other volunteer will show up and fail to make the event happen. In this case, the volunteer who didn't show up can claim that they would have made the event successful if they had attended.\n\nIn summary, the best decision for each volunteer depends on their individual goals and priorities. If the volunteers prioritize the success of the community event, they should all show up and contribute. If they prioritize personal credit, they may choose not to show up, hoping that others will fail to make the event happen. However, this strategy risks the event not happening at all."
