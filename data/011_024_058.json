    "message_1": "A factory has to produce 500 units of a product in a day. There are two machines, M1 and M2, that can produce the product. It takes M1 2 minutes to produce one unit and M2 3 minutes to produce one unit. However, M1 is available for 6 hours a day and M2 is available for 8 hours a day. What should be the production schedule for each machine to meet the daily target and minimize the production time?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units produced by M1 and y be the number of units produced by M2. We need to find the values of x and y such that x + y = 500 (to meet the daily target) and the total production time is minimized.\n\nFirst, let's convert the available hours of each machine to minutes:\nM1: 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes\nM2: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes\n\nNow, we can write the time constraint equations for each machine:\nM1: 2x ≤ 360\nM2: 3y ≤ 480\n\nWe need to minimize the total production time, which can be represented as:\nTotal time = 2x + 3y\n\nNow, we need to solve this linear programming problem. We can use the graphical method to find the optimal solution.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\nM1: x ≤ 180\nM2: y ≤ 160\n\nSince x and y represent the number of units produced, they must be non-negative:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll plot these constraints on a graph and find the feasible region. The feasible region will be a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (180,0), (0,160), and (120,80).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function (total production time) at each vertex of the feasible region:\n1. (0,0): 2(0) + 3(0) = 0\n2. (180,0): 2(180) + 3(0) = 360\n3. (0,160): 2(0) + 3(160) = 480\n4. (120,80): 2(120) + 3(80) = 240 + 240 = 480\n\nThe minimum total production time is 480 minutes, which occurs at the vertex (120,80). Therefore, M1 should produce 120 units, and M2 should produce 80 units to meet the daily target and minimize the production time."
