    "message_2": "To find the probability of a hurricane occurring in a specific region, we can use the historical data provided. \n\nOut of the past 50 years, hurricanes struck the region 6 times. So, the probability of a hurricane occurring in that region can be calculated as:\n\n(Number of times hurricanes struck the region) / (Total number of years)\n\nProbability = 6 / 50\n\nProbability = 0.12\n\nTherefore, the probability of a hurricane occurring in the specific region is 0.12 or 12%."
