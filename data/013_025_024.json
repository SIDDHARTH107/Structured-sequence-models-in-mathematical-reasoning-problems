    "message_1": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, two travelers are asked to name a whole number between 1 and 100. The winner will be the one who chooses the lowest unique number. However, if both choose the same number, they both receive a payoff equal to that number. What number should each traveler choose to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, the best strategy for each traveler is to choose the number 1. This is because if both travelers choose 1, they will both receive a payoff of 1. If one traveler chooses a higher number, they risk losing to the other traveler who chose 1, as the lowest unique number wins. By choosing 1, both travelers ensure they receive a payoff and minimize the risk of losing."
