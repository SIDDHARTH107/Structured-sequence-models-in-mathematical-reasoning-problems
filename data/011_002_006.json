    "message_2": "We can use the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of x^3 in the expansion of (1 + x)^5. The binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer n and any real numbers a and b:\n\n(a + b)^n = Î£ [C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k], where the sum is from k = 0 to n, and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, also known as \"n choose k\" or the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = x, and n = 5. We want to find the coefficient of x^3, so we need to find the term with k = 3:\n\nC(5, 3) * 1^(5-3) * x^3 = C(5, 3) * x^3\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = (5 * 4) / 2 = 10\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^3 in the expansion of (1 + x)^5 is 10."
