    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the system, we need to set the right-hand sides of the equations equal to zero:\n\ndx/dt = -y = 0\ndy/dt = x - x^3 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we have y = 0. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx - x^3 = 0\nx(1 - x^2) = 0\n\nThis gives us three critical points: (0, 0), (1, 0), and (-1, 0).\n\nNow, let's determine the stability of these critical points. To do this, we will linearize the system by finding the Jacobian matrix:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂(dx/dt)/∂x  ∂(dx/dt)/∂y | = |  0   -1  |\n          | ∂(dy/dt)/∂x  ∂(dy/dt)/∂y |   | 1-3x^2  0  |\n\nNow, we will evaluate the Jacobian matrix at each critical point and find the eigenvalues.\n\n1. For the critical point (0, 0):\n\nJ(0, 0) = |  0  -1  |\n          |  1   0  |\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are λ = ±i. Since the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, the critical point (0, 0) is a center, which means it is neutrally stable.\n\n2. For the critical point (1, 0):\n\nJ(1, 0) = |  0  -1  |\n          | -2   0  |\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are λ = ±√2i. Again, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so the critical point (1, 0) is also a center and neutrally stable.\n\n3. For the critical point (-1, 0):\n\nJ(-1, 0) = |  0  -1  |\n           |  2   0  |\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are λ = ±√2i. Once more, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so the critical point (-1, 0) is a center and neutrally stable.\n\nNow, let's sketch the phase portrait of the system. Since all critical points are centers, we expect closed orbits around each of them. The phase portrait will show a symmetric behavior with respect to the x-axis due to the symmetry of the given equations. The orbits around the critical points (1, 0) and (-1, 0) will be distorted due to the nonlinear term x^3 in the second equation.\n\nTo summarize, the system has three critical points: (0, 0), (1, 0), and (-1, 0), all of which are centers and neutrally stable. The phase portrait will show closed orbits around each critical point with symmetric behavior with respect to the x-axis."
