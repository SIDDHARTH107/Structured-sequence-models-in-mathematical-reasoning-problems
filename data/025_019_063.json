    "message_2": "Let's first recall some basic definitions and facts:\n\n1. A smooth cubic surface $S$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is a surface defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in 4 variables.\n2. The degree of a surface is the degree of its defining polynomial, so the degree of $S$ is 3.\n3. A hyperplane section $H$ of $S$ is the intersection of $S$ with a hyperplane in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The hyperplane can be defined by a linear equation in 4 variables.\n4. The complete intersection of $S$ and $H$ is the curve $C$ on $S$ defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the equations for $S$ and $H$.\n\nNow, let's find the degree of $C$. Since $C$ is the complete intersection of $S$ and $H$, we can use the formula for the degree of a complete intersection:\n\nDegree of $C$ = (Degree of $S$) × (Degree of $H$)\n\nThe degree of $S$ is 3, as mentioned earlier. The degree of $H$ is 1, as it is a hyperplane defined by a linear equation. Therefore, the degree of $C$ is:\n\nDegree of $C$ = 3 × 1 = 3\n\nSo, the degree of the curve $C$ on the smooth cubic surface $S$ is 3."
