    "message_1": "Sure, here's a cheap talk problem: \n\nIn a two-player game with complete information, Player A can either play strategy X or strategy Y. The payoffs for each player are as follows: \n\n- If both players choose X, Player A gets 4 and Player B gets 1. \n- If both players choose Y, Player A gets 3 and Player B gets 2. \n- If Player A chooses X and Player B chooses Y, Player A gets 2 and Player B gets 3.\n- If Player A chooses Y and Player B chooses X, Player A gets 0 and Player B gets 0.\n\nBefore the game begins, Player A sends a message to Player B, who then chooses a strategy. Player B knows the payoffs, but does not observe Player A's action. If Player B believes that there is a 60% chance Player A will choose X and a 40% chance Player A will choose Y, what strategy should Player B choose to maximize their expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for Player B, we need to calculate the expected payoffs for each of their possible choices (X or Y) given the probabilities of Player A choosing X or Y.\n\nExpected payoff for Player B if they choose X:\n(0.6 * 1) + (0.4 * 0) = 0.6\n\nExpected payoff for Player B if they choose Y:\n(0.6 * 3) + (0.4 * 2) = 1.8 + 0.8 = 2.6\n\nSince the expected payoff for Player B is higher when they choose Y (2.6) compared to when they choose X (0.6), Player B should choose strategy Y to maximize their expected payoff."
