    "message_2": "First, let's visualize the sets A and B. Set A is the set of all points (x, y) in ℝ² such that their distance from the origin (0, 0) is less than or equal to 2 (i.e., a closed disk of radius 2 centered at the origin). Set B is the set of all points (x, y) in ℝ² such that their distance from the point (1, 0) is less than or equal to 1 (i.e., a closed disk of radius 1 centered at the point (1, 0)).\n\nNow, let's consider the union of A and B, denoted as A ∪ B. We want to determine whether this union is connected or path-connected.\n\nA set is connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty open subsets. A set is path-connected if for any two points in the set, there exists a continuous path connecting them within the set.\n\nNotice that the two disks A and B have a nonempty intersection, as the point (1, 0) lies in both A and B (since 1² + 0² ≤ 4 and (1 - 1)² + 0² ≤ 1). This means that there is at least one point that is common to both sets.\n\nNow, let's take any two points p and q in the union A ∪ B. If both points are in the same set (either A or B), then there is a continuous path connecting them within that set (since both A and B are connected as closed disks). If the points are in different sets, we can still find a continuous path connecting them by going through the common point (1, 0) that we found earlier.\n\nThus, for any two points in A ∪ B, there exists a continuous path connecting them within the set, which means that the union A ∪ B is path-connected.\n\nSince path-connectedness implies connectedness, we can conclude that the union A ∪ B is connected as well."
