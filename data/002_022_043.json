    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the radius of the circular cross-section of the torus (in this case, 3 cm) and major_radius is the distance from the center of the circular cross-section to the center of the torus (in this case, 8 cm).\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 3^2) * (2 * π * 8)\nVolume = (π * 9) * (16 * π)\nVolume = 144 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 144π^2 cubic centimeters. To get a numerical value, we can use the approximation π ≈ 3.14159:\n\nVolume ≈ 144 * (3.14159)^2\nVolume ≈ 144 * 9.8696\nVolume ≈ 1421.69 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 1421.69 cubic centimeters."
