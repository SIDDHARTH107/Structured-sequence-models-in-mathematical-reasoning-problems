    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the function f(x) = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf(x) = x^(3/2)\nf'(x) = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug f'(x) into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral. To do this, we can use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 1 + (9/4)x\ndu/dx = 9/4\ndx = (4/9)du\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[(1+9/4),(1+9)] √(u) (4/9) du\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [(1+9/4),(1+9)]\n\nL = (8/27) * [(10)^(3/2) - (13/4)^(3/2)]\n\nL = (8/27) * [10√10 - (13/2)√(13/2)]\n\nNow, we can approximate the numerical value of the arc length:\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * (31.6227766 - 14.2302495)\nL ≈ (8/27) * 17.3925271\nL ≈ 5.1648628\n\nSo, the arc length of the function f(x) = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4 is approximately 5.1648628."
