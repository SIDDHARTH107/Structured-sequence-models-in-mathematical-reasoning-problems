    "message_2": "By the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 7-subgroup and a Sylow 11-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 7-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 11-subgroup. Then, |P| = 7 and |Q| = 11.\n\nNow, we will count the number of Sylow 7-subgroups and Sylow 11-subgroups in G. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides 11 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus, n_7 = 1 or 11. Similarly, the number of Sylow 11-subgroups, n_11, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 11. Thus, n_11 = 1 or 7.\n\nCase 1: n_7 = n_11 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup and one Sylow 11-subgroup in G. Since P and Q are both normal in G, we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, respectively.\n\nCase 2: n_7 = 1 and n_11 = 7\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup and seven Sylow 11-subgroups in G. Since P is normal in G, we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, respectively.\n\nCase 3: n_7 = 11 and n_11 = 1\nIn this case, there are eleven Sylow 7-subgroups and only one Sylow 11-subgroup in G. Since Q is normal in G, we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, respectively.\n\nCase 4: n_7 = 11 and n_11 = 7\nIn this case, there are eleven Sylow 7-subgroups and seven Sylow 11-subgroups in G. However, this case is not possible because the total number of elements in G would be greater than 77, which is a contradiction.\n\nIn all possible cases, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11. Therefore, G is either cyclic (if the direct product is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 77) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11."
