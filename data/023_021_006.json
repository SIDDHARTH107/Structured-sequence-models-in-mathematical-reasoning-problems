    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field induced by the current at a distance of 2 meters from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since we are asked to use the Fourier transform, we will first find the time-domain expression for the magnetic field and then apply the Fourier transform to find the frequency-domain expression.\n\nThe time-domain expression for the magnetic field B(t) at a distance r from a long straight wire carrying a sinusoidal current I(t) = I0 * sin(2 * π * f * t) is given by:\n\nB(t) = (μ0 * I(t)) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ0 is the permeability of free space (4 * π * 10^(-7) Tm/A), I0 is the amplitude of the current (5 A), f is the frequency of the current (50 Hz), and r is the distance from the wire (2 m).\n\nNow, we can apply the Fourier transform to find the frequency-domain expression for the magnetic field B(ω):\n\nB(ω) = (μ0 * I(ω)) / (2 * π * r)\n\nThe Fourier transform of the sinusoidal current I(t) is given by:\n\nI(ω) = I0 * [δ(ω - ω0) - δ(ω + ω0)] / 2j\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function, ω0 is the angular frequency (2 * π * f), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nSubstituting the Fourier transform of the current into the expression for the magnetic field:\n\nB(ω) = (μ0 * I0 * [δ(ω - ω0) - δ(ω + ω0)]) / (4 * π * j * r)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nB(ω) = (4 * π * 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * [δ(ω - 2 * π * 50 Hz) - δ(ω + 2 * π * 50 Hz)]) / (4 * π * 2 m * j)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nB(ω) = (10^(-6) T * [δ(ω - 100 * π) - δ(ω + 100 * π)]) / j\n\nThis is the frequency-domain expression for the magnetic field induced by the current at a distance of 2 meters from the wire. To find the magnetic field at the given frequency of 50 Hz, we can evaluate the expression at ω = ω0:\n\nB(ω0) = (10^(-6) T * [δ(0) - δ(200 * π)]) / j\n\nSince the Dirac delta function δ(0) is infinite and δ(200 * π) is zero, the magnetic field at the given frequency cannot be determined using the Fourier transform. However, we can still find the time-domain expression for the magnetic field using the Biot-Savart law:\n\nB(t) = (4 * π * 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * sin(2 * π * 50 Hz * t)) / (2 * π * 2 m)\n\nB(t) = (10^(-6) T * sin(100 * π * t)) / 2\n\nThis is the time-domain expression for the magnetic field induced by the current at a distance of 2 meters from the wire."
