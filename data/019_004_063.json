    "message_2": "In temporal logic notation, we can represent the arrival time of the train at Station B as follows:\n\nLet A represent the event \"train leaves Station A at 2:00 PM\" and B represent the event \"train arrives at Station B\". We can use the \"always\" operator (□) and the \"until\" operator (U) to express the relationship between these events.\n\nFormula: A U (B ∧ (time = 4:00 PM))\n\nThis formula states that event A (train leaving Station A at 2:00 PM) is true until event B (train arriving at Station B) occurs, and the arrival time at Station B is 4:00 PM."
