    "message_1": "Suppose a company has 10 employees and wants to organize a team-building event. In how many ways can the company split the employees into smaller groups, where each group has at least 2 employees? (Hint: Use the Bell numbers formula to solve this problem.)",
    "message_2": "The Bell numbers formula is used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. However, in this problem, we need to find the number of ways to partition the set of employees into groups of at least 2 employees. To solve this problem, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind.\n\nThe Stirling number of the second kind, S(n, k), represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we have n = 10 employees, and we want to find the number of ways to partition them into k groups, where each group has at least 2 employees.\n\nWe can have a minimum of k = 2 groups (5 employees in each group) and a maximum of k = 5 groups (2 employees in each group). So, we need to find the sum of the Stirling numbers of the second kind for k = 2 to k = 5.\n\nS(10, 2) + S(10, 3) + S(10, 4) + S(10, 5)\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind formula or looking up the values in a table, we get:\n\nS(10, 2) = 511\nS(10, 3) = 9330\nS(10, 4) = 34105\nS(10, 5) = 42525\n\nNow, sum these values:\n\n511 + 9330 + 34105 + 42525 = 86471\n\nSo, there are 86,471 ways to split the 10 employees into smaller groups, where each group has at least 2 employees."
