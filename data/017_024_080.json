    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the powers of its prime divisors.\n2. The number of groups of a given order is determined by the number of ways to partition the prime powers.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Now we need to find the number of ways to partition the powers of the prime divisors.\n\nFor the power of 2 (i.e., 2^5), we have the following partitions:\n- 5 (i.e., 2^5)\n- 4 + 1 (i.e., 2^4 * 2^1)\n- 3 + 2 (i.e., 2^3 * 2^2)\n- 3 + 1 + 1 (i.e., 2^3 * 2^1 * 2^1)\n\nFor the power of 3 (i.e., 3^1), we have only one partition:\n- 1 (i.e., 3^1)\n\nNow we need to find the number of groups for each combination of partitions. We will use the formula for the number of groups of order p^a * q^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are positive integers:\n\nNumber of groups = (number of groups of order p^a) * (number of groups of order q^b)\n\nFor each combination of partitions, we have:\n\n1. 2^5 * 3^1:\n   - Number of groups = (number of groups of order 2^5) * (number of groups of order 3^1)\n   - Number of groups = 7 * 1\n   - Number of groups = 7\n\n2. 2^4 * 2^1 * 3^1:\n   - Number of groups = (number of groups of order 2^4) * (number of groups of order 2^1) * (number of groups of order 3^1)\n   - Number of groups = 2 * 1 * 1\n   - Number of groups = 2\n\n3. 2^3 * 2^2 * 3^1:\n   - Number of groups = (number of groups of order 2^3) * (number of groups of order 2^2) * (number of groups of order 3^1)\n   - Number of groups = 1 * 1 * 1\n   - Number of groups = 1\n\n4. 2^3 * 2^1 * 2^1 * 3^1:\n   - Number of groups = (number of groups of order 2^3) * (number of groups of order 2^1) * (number of groups of order 2^1) * (number of groups of order 3^1)\n   - Number of groups = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1\n   - Number of groups = 1\n\nAdding up the number of groups for each combination of partitions, we get:\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96 = 7 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11."
