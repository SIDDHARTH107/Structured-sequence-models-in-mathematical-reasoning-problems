    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder is 20 feet long, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 20^2\n\nWe are also given that the bottom of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second (dx/dt = 2 ft/s). We want to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall (dy/dt) when x = 16 feet.\n\nFirst, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(20^2)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(16)(2) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nTo find the value of y when x = 16, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n16^2 + y^2 = 20^2\n256 + y^2 = 400\ny^2 = 144\ny = 12\n\nNow we can plug in the value of y and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(16)(2) + 2(12)(dy/dt) = 0\n64 + 24(dy/dt) = 0\n24(dy/dt) = -64\ndy/dt = -64/24\ndy/dt = -8/3\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 8/3 feet per second when the bottom of the ladder is 16 feet away from the wall."
