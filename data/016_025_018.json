    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve fractal is formed by removing triangles from the previous stage. In each stage, the number of triangles removed is equal to the number of triangles in the previous stage. Therefore, the total number of triangles in each stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal triangles in stage n = Total triangles in stage (n-1) + Triangles removed in stage n\n\nFor stage 1, we remove 1 triangle, so the total number of triangles is 1 + 1 = 2.\nFor stage 2, we remove 3 triangles, so the total number of triangles is 2 + 3 = 5.\nFor stage 3, we remove 9 triangles, so the total number of triangles is 5 + 9 = 14.\n\nWe can notice a pattern here: the number of triangles removed in each stage is a power of 3 (3^0, 3^1, 3^2, ...). So, we can calculate the total number of triangles in stage 7 as follows:\n\nTotal triangles in stage 7 = 1 (initial triangle) + 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5 + 3^6\nTotal triangles in stage 7 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729\nTotal triangles in stage 7 = 1094\n\nSo, there are 1094 triangles in stage 7 of the Sierpinski sieve fractal."
