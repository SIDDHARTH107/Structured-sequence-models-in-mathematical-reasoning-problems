    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg with a length of 5 cm, and the other leg with a length of 12 cm. Determine the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this case, one leg (a) has a length of 5 cm, and the other leg (b) has a length of 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nc² = 5² + 12²\nc² = 25 + 144\nc² = 169\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we need to take the square root of 169:\n\nc = √169\nc = 13\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 13 cm."
