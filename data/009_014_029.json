If the growth rate parameter is 0.3, what will the population be after 5 years? Round your answer to the nearest integer.",
    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate parameter, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, K = 2500, P0 = 200, r = 0.3, and t = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(5) = 2500 / (1 + (2500 - 200) / 200 * e^(-0.3*5))\n\nP(5) = 2500 / (1 + 2300 / 200 * e^(-1.5))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of the expression:\n\n2300 / 200 * e^(-1.5) ≈ 11.5 * 0.2231 ≈ 2.568\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(5) = 2500 / (1 + 2.568) ≈ 2500 / 3.568 ≈ 700.56\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, the population after 5 years will be approximately 701 rabbits."
