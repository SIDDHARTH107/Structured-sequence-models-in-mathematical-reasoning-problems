    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nFirst, let's find A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets, A and B, is the set of elements that are common to both A and B. In this case, A ∩ B = {5, 9}.\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A. By definition, a set C is a subset of a set A if every element of C is also an element of A. In this case, the elements of A ∩ B are 5 and 9. Since both 5 and 9 are elements of A, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNext, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of B. Similarly, we need to show that every element of A ∩ B is also an element of B. The elements of A ∩ B are 5 and 9, and both 5 and 9 are elements of B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B using set theory."
