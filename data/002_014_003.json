    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one of the length-width faces is 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 24 cm² * 2 = 48 cm².\n2. The area of one of the length-height faces is 6 cm * 3 cm = 18 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 18 cm² * 2 = 36 cm².\n3. The area of one of the width-height faces is 4 cm * 3 cm = 12 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 12 cm² * 2 = 24 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together: 48 cm² + 36 cm² + 24 cm² = 108 cm².\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 108 cm²."
