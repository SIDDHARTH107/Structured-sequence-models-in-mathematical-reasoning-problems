    "message_1": "Consider a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) on a closed manifold $M$ with the assigned algebra $A$. Let $a \\in A$ be an element of this algebra. Find the value of the partition function, $Z(M)$, when we change $a$ to $3a$. Assume the TQFT satisfies the axioms of a 2-dimensional TQFT.",
    "message_2": "In a 2-dimensional topological quantum field theory (TQFT), the partition function $Z(M)$ is a topological invariant, meaning that it does not depend on the particular choice of algebra element $a \\in A$. Therefore, changing $a$ to $3a$ will not affect the value of the partition function.\n\nTo see this more explicitly, recall that a 2-dimensional TQFT assigns a vector space $Z(\\Sigma)$ to each closed 1-manifold $\\Sigma$ and a linear map $Z(M): Z(\\partial M) \\to Z(\\partial M)$ to each closed 2-manifold $M$. The axioms of a 2-dimensional TQFT ensure that the partition function $Z(M)$ is invariant under homeomorphisms of $M$ and is multiplicative under disjoint union.\n\nNow, consider the closed manifold $M$ with the assigned algebra $A$. Changing the element $a \\in A$ to $3a$ corresponds to rescaling the algebra by a factor of 3. However, since the partition function is a topological invariant, this rescaling will not affect the value of $Z(M)$.\n\nThus, the partition function $Z(M)$ remains unchanged when we change $a$ to $3a$."
