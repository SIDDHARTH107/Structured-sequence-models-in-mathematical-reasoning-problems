    "message_1": "Suppose the weights of newborn babies in a certain hospital follow a normal distribution with a mean of 7.5 pounds and a standard deviation of 1.2 pounds. What is the probability that a newborn baby selected at random from this hospital weighs between 6 and 9 pounds?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a newborn baby weighs between 6 and 9 pounds, we need to use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) table. First, we need to convert the given weights to Z-scores using the formula:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere Z is the Z-score, X is the weight, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor 6 pounds:\nZ1 = (6 - 7.5) / 1.2\nZ1 = -1.5 / 1.2\nZ1 ≈ -1.25\n\nFor 9 pounds:\nZ2 = (9 - 7.5) / 1.2\nZ2 = 1.5 / 1.2\nZ2 ≈ 1.25\n\nNow, we need to find the probabilities corresponding to these Z-scores from the standard normal distribution table. \n\nP(Z1) ≈ 0.211\nP(Z2) ≈ 0.789\n\nTo find the probability that a newborn baby weighs between 6 and 9 pounds, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(6 < X < 9) = P(Z2) - P(Z1)\nP(6 < X < 9) = 0.789 - 0.211\nP(6 < X < 9) ≈ 0.578\n\nSo, the probability that a newborn baby selected at random from this hospital weighs between 6 and 9 pounds is approximately 57.8%."
