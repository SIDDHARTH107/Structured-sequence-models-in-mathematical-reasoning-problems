    "message_1": "A metal ring has a radius of 8 cm and a cross-sectional radius of 2 cm. What is the volume of the torus formed when the ring is rotated about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the ring? (Use π = 3.14)",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the cross-section), and r is the minor radius (radius of the cross-section).\n\nIn this case, R = 8 cm and r = 2 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * (3.14)^2 * 8 * (2)^3\n\nVolume = 2 * (9.8596) * 8 * 8\n\nVolume = 19.7192 * 64\n\nVolume ≈ 1261.63 cubic centimeters"
