    "message_1": "A signal \"f(t)\" is defined as f(t) = cos(2πt) + sin(4πt) over the interval [-3,3]. Apply Fourier analysis to find the Fourier Transform of the signal and determine its frequency content.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform of the given signal f(t) = cos(2πt) + sin(4πt), we can use the following formula for the continuous-time Fourier Transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the entire time domain.\n\nIn this case, we can break the integral into two parts, one for each term in the signal:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt + ∫[sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can use the Euler's formula to convert the cosine and sine functions into complex exponentials:\n\ncos(2πt) = (e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt))/2\nsin(4πt) = (e^(j4πt) - e^(-j4πt))/(2j)\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the integral:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)∫[(e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt + (1/2j)∫[(e^(j4πt) - e^(-j4πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)∫[e^(-j(ω-2π)t) + e^(-j(ω+2π)t)] dt + (1/2j)∫[e^(-j(ω-4π)t) - e^(-j(ω+4π)t)] dt\n\nNow, we can solve each integral separately:\n\n∫[e^(-j(ω-2π)t)] dt = (-1/j(ω-2π)) * e^(-j(ω-2π)t)\n∫[e^(-j(ω+2π)t)] dt = (-1/j(ω+2π)) * e^(-j(ω+2π)t)\n∫[e^(-j(ω-4π)t)] dt = (-1/j(ω-4π)) * e^(-j(ω-4π)t)\n∫[e^(-j(ω+4π)t)] dt = (-1/j(ω+4π)) * e^(-j(ω+4π)t)\n\nSubstitute these results back into the expression for F(ω):\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)[-1/j(ω-2π) * e^(-j(ω-2π)t) - 1/j(ω+2π) * e^(-j(ω+2π)t)] + (1/2j)[-1/j(ω-4π) * e^(-j(ω-4π)t) + 1/j(ω+4π) * e^(-j(ω+4π)t)]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/2j)[1/(ω-2π) * e^(-j(ω-2π)t) - 1/(ω+2π) * e^(-j(ω+2π)t) + 1/(ω-4π) * e^(-j(ω-4π)t) - 1/(ω+4π) * e^(-j(ω+4π)t)]\n\nNow, we can analyze the frequency content of the signal by looking at the poles of the Fourier Transform:\n\nThere are poles at ω = ±2π and ω = ±4π.\n\nThis means that the signal has frequency components at ω = ±2π and ω = ±4π, which correspond to the frequencies f1 = ±1 Hz and f2 = ±2 Hz."
