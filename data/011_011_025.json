    "message_2": "To partition the number 7 into distinct positive integers, we need to find all the possible combinations of numbers that add up to 7 without repeating any number. Here are the possible partitions:\n\n1. 1 + 2 + 4\n2. 1 + 3 + 3 (This is not a valid partition since 3 is repeated)\n3. 1 + 6\n4. 2 + 5\n5. 3 + 4\n6. 7\n\nThere are 5 ways to partition the number 7 into distinct positive integers."
