    "message_2": "Let's first understand the problem and the terms involved. In an Apollonian gasket, we start with three mutually tangent circles, and then we add more circles that are tangent to each pair of the initial circles. The process is repeated infinitely.\n\nThe curvature of a circle is defined as the reciprocal of its radius, i.e., k = 1/r. In this problem, the initial circle has a radius of 2, so its curvature is k = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's consider the first three circles in the Apollonian gasket. We have the initial circle with curvature 1/2, and two other circles tangent to it. Let their curvatures be k1 and k2. According to the problem, the curvature of each subsequent tangent circle is equal to the sum of the curvatures of the two circles that it is tangent to. So, we have:\n\nk1 = (1/2) + k2\n\nNow, let's consider the next circle tangent to both k1 and k2. Let its curvature be k3. We have:\n\nk3 = k1 + k2 = (1/2) + k2 + k2 = (1/2) + 2k2\n\nThe process continues infinitely, and we want to find the sum of the curvatures of all the circles in the Apollonian gasket.\n\nLet S be the sum of the curvatures of all the circles. We can write S as:\n\nS = (1/2) + k1 + k2 + k3 + ...\n\nNow, substituting k1 and k3 from the equations above, we get:\n\nS = (1/2) + ((1/2) + k2) + k2 + ((1/2) + 2k2) + ...\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with the first term a = 1/2 and the common ratio r = k2. To find the sum of an infinite geometric series, we can use the formula:\n\nS = a / (1 - r)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nS = (1/2) / (1 - k2)\n\nSince k2 is the curvature of a circle, it must be positive. Therefore, the sum S will be finite and positive. However, we cannot determine the exact value of S without knowing the value of k2, which depends on the specific configuration of the Apollonian gasket."
