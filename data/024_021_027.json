    "message_2": "To find the Killing vector fields of the given Riemannian metric, we need to solve the Killing equation:\n\n$\\nabla_X Y + \\nabla_Y X = 0$\n\nwhere $X$ and $Y$ are vector fields on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection associated with the metric $g$. Let $X = X^1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + X^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ and $Y = Y^1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + Y^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. Then the Killing equation can be written as a system of partial differential equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial X^1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial X^2}{\\partial y} + (x+y)\\frac{\\partial Y^1}{\\partial y} + (x+y)\\frac{\\partial Y^2}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial Y^1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial Y^2}{\\partial y} + (x+y)\\frac{\\partial X^1}{\\partial y} + (x+y)\\frac{\\partial X^2}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\nWe can solve this system of PDEs to find the Killing vector fields. After some calculations, we find that the general solution is given by:\n\n$X = (a + bx) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (c + dy) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$\n\n$Y = (a' + b'x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (c' + d'y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d, a', b', c', d'$ are constants. The Killing vector fields are linear combinations of the following basis vector fields:\n\n$K_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$\n\n$K_2 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$\n\n$K_3 = x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$\n\nNow, we need to verify that these Killing vector fields form a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket operation. The Lie bracket of two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ is defined as $[X, Y] = XY - YX$. We compute the Lie brackets of the basis Killing vector fields:\n\n$[K_1, K_2] = K_1K_2 - K_2K_1 = 0$\n\n$[K_1, K_3] = K_1K_3 - K_3K_1 = K_1$\n\n$[K_2, K_3] = K_2K_3 - K_3K_2 = K_2$\n\nWe see that the Lie brackets of the basis Killing vector fields are linear combinations of the basis Killing vector fields themselves. Therefore, the Killing vector fields form a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket operation."
