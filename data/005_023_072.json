    "message_1": "Suppose a set of seven data points has a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2.5. If one outlier is removed from the set, and the new mean of the remaining data points is 9, what is the value of the outlier?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the sum of the seven data points as S and the outlier as x. Since the mean of the seven data points is 10, we can write:\n\nS / 7 = 10\n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS = 70\n\nNow, let's remove the outlier x from the set. The sum of the remaining six data points will be:\n\nS - x\n\nSince the mean of the remaining six data points is 9, we can write:\n\n(S - x) / 6 = 9\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nS - x = 54\n\nNow, we know that S = 70, so we can substitute that value into the equation:\n\n70 - x = 54\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 70 - 54\nx = 16\n\nSo, the value of the outlier is 16."
