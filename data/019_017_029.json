Let $\\zeta$ be the class of all non-empty linearly ordered sets with the least element. \n\nFor any $\\Theta\\subseteq\\zeta$, let $Th(\\Theta)\\subseteq L$ be the set of all L-sentences true in every model of $\\Theta$. Let $Th(\\zeta)=\\bigcap\\{Th(\\Theta)\\mid\\Theta\\subseteq\\zeta$ and $\\Theta$ is a set of models of L\\}.\n\nSuppose $M\\models Th(\\zeta)$, $M\\neq\\varnothing$, and $M$ is finite. Show that $M$ must have a largest element.",
    "message_2": "Assume for the sake of contradiction that $M$ does not have a largest element. Since $M$ is finite and non-empty, let $m$ be an element in $M$ with the least number of elements greater than it. In other words, there are fewer elements in $M$ greater than $m$ than any other element in $M$. \n\nNow, consider the set $M' = M \\cup \\{m'\\}$, where $m'$ is a new element not in $M$ such that for all $x \\in M$, $x < m'$. We can define a linear order on $M'$ by extending the order on $M$ and adding the new element $m'$ as the largest element. Note that $M'$ is a non-empty linearly ordered set with the least element, so it belongs to $\\zeta$.\n\nLet $\\Theta = \\{M, M'\\}$. Then, $Th(\\Theta) \\subseteq Th(\\zeta)$, since $\\Theta \\subseteq \\zeta$. Now, consider the L-sentence $\\phi = \\forall x (x < m' \\rightarrow x \\leq m)$. This sentence is true in the model $M'$, so $\\phi \\in Th(\\Theta)$. Since $Th(\\Theta) \\subseteq Th(\\zeta)$, we have $\\phi \\in Th(\\zeta)$.\n\nHowever, since $M \\models Th(\\zeta)$, $M$ must satisfy $\\phi$. But this is a contradiction, because $m$ was chosen such that there are elements in $M$ greater than it, and thus $M$ does not satisfy $\\phi$. This contradiction implies that our assumption that $M$ does not have a largest element is false.\n\nTherefore, if $M \\models Th(\\zeta)$, $M \\neq \\varnothing$, and $M$ is finite, then $M$ must have a largest element."
