    "message_1": "A company claims that the average weight of their cereal box is 500g. To test this claim, a sample of 40 boxes was randomly selected and weighed. The sample average weight was found to be 490g with a standard deviation of 25g. Is there sufficient evidence to reject the company's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average weight of the cereal boxes is 500g, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average weight is not 500g.\n\nH0: μ = 500g\nH1: μ ≠ 500g\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 40\nSample mean (x̄) = 490g\nSample standard deviation (s) = 25g\nSignificance level (α) = 5% = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is 40, which is greater than 30, we can use the t-distribution to perform the t-test.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the t-score\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (490 - 500) / (25 / √40)\nt = -10 / (25 / 6.325)\nt = -10 / 3.937\nt ≈ -2.54\n\nStep 2: Determine the critical t-value\nSince we are performing a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance, we need to find the t-value that corresponds to 2.5% in each tail (0.025 in the left tail and 0.975 in the right tail) with degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39.\n\nUsing a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\nt(0.025, 39) ≈ -2.023\nt(0.975, 39) ≈ 2.023\n\nStep 3: Compare the t-score to the critical t-value\nOur calculated t-score is -2.54, which falls in the left tail beyond the critical t-value of -2.023.\n\nSince the t-score falls in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis (H0). There is sufficient evidence at a 5% level of significance to reject the company's claim that the average weight of their cereal box is 500g."
