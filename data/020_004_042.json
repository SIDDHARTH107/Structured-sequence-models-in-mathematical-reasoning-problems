    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of producing x units of a certain product. The cost function is given by C(x) = 10x^2 - 400x + 20,000. What is the minimum cost of producing 50 units of the product?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of producing 50 units of the product, we need to plug in x = 50 into the cost function C(x) and calculate the result.\n\nC(50) = 10(50)^2 - 400(50) + 20,000\n\nC(50) = 10(2500) - 20,000 + 20,000\n\nC(50) = 25,000 - 20,000 + 20,000\n\nC(50) = 25,000\n\nSo, the minimum cost of producing 50 units of the product is $25,000."
