    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that starts with a single square. In each iteration, the square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square and the four corner squares are retained. This process is repeated for each of the retained squares.\n\nTo find the total number of squares in the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal squares = (5^n) - 4^n, where n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 6th iteration:\n\nTotal squares = (5^6) - 4^6\nTotal squares = 15625 - 4096\nTotal squares = 11529\n\nSo, there are 11,529 squares in the 6th iteration of the Vicsek fractal."
