    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is created by a recursive process. In each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 7/3. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the curve is 7 times the original length (7 segments, each 1 unit long). \n\nAfter the second iteration, the length of the curve is (7/3) times the length after the first iteration, which is (7/3) * 7 = 49/3 units.\n\nAfter the third iteration, the length of the curve is (7/3) times the length after the second iteration, which is (7/3) * (49/3) = 343/9 units.\n\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of the curve is (7/3) times the length after the third iteration, which is (7/3) * (343/9) = 2401/27 units.\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after four iterations is 2401/27 units, which is approximately 88.93 units."
