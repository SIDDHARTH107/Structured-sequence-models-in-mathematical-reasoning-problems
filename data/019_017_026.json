    "message_2": "1. True. Since 1 divides every element in A, 1 is the minimum element of (A, ≤).\n2. False. The maximum element of (A, ≤) would be an element that is divisible by all other elements in A. In this case, 4 is the maximum element, as it is divisible by 1, 2, and itself (4).\n3. True. For any x ∈ A, we can find a y ∈ A such that x ≤ y. Specifically, we can choose y = x or y = lcm(x, other elements in A). In this case, for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, we can choose y = 4, as 4 is divisible by all of them.\n4. True. If x ≤ y and y ≤ x, that means x divides y and y divides x. The only way this can happen is if x = y."
