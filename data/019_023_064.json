    "message_2": "This problem is related to inductive logic, which means that we cannot provide an exact probability based on the given information. However, we can discuss the problem in terms of inductive reasoning.\n\nInductive reasoning suggests that if you have observed a pattern in the past, it is likely to continue in the future. In this case, you have observed three black ravens, so you might be inclined to think that the next raven you see will also be black. However, this is not a guarantee, as there may be other colors of ravens that you have not yet observed.\n\nWithout knowing the actual proportion of black ravens in the park or the total number of ravens, it is impossible to provide an exact probability. The answer choices provided (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) do not have any direct relevance to the problem, as they are arbitrary percentages.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot provide an exact probability for this problem based on the given information."
