    "message_1": "In a construction site, there is a 2% chance that a worker will be involved in an accident. If there are 50 workers on the site, what is the probability that at least 2 of them will be involved in an accident?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 workers will be involved in an accident, we can first find the probability that none or only one worker will be involved in an accident, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of no workers being involved in an accident. The probability of a worker not being involved in an accident is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98. For all 50 workers to not be involved in an accident, we have:\n\nP(0 accidents) = (0.98)^50 ≈ 0.3642\n\nNow let's find the probability of exactly one worker being involved in an accident. We can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(k accidents) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of workers, k is the number of accidents, p is the probability of a worker being involved in an accident, and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFor our problem, n = 50, k = 1, and p = 0.02. So we have:\n\nP(1 accident) = C(50, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (0.98)^49 ≈ 0.3773\n\nNow we can find the probability of at least 2 accidents by subtracting the probabilities of 0 and 1 accidents from 1:\n\nP(at least 2 accidents) = 1 - P(0 accidents) - P(1 accident) ≈ 1 - 0.3642 - 0.3773 ≈ 0.2585\n\nSo the probability that at least 2 workers will be involved in an accident is approximately 25.85%."
