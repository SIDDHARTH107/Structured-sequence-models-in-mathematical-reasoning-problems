    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 3} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, which is denoted as B Δ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, meaning A Δ B = B Δ A, we already have the result:\n\nB Δ A = A Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nFinally, we need to find the intersection of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A):\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (B Δ A) = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 4} = {1, 4}\n\nSo, (A Δ B) ∩ (B Δ A) = {1, 4}."
