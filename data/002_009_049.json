    "message_2": "To calculate the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to find the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe surface area of one circular base can be found using the formula: A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nThe radius of the cylinder is 5 cm, so the surface area of one circular base is:\n\nA = π(5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, the total surface area of the bases is:\n\n2 * 25π cm² = 50π cm²\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be found using the formula: A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nThe radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm, so the lateral surface area is:\n\nA = 2π(5 cm)(10 cm) = 100π cm²\n\nFinally, let's add the surface area of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = Surface area of bases + Lateral surface area\nTotal surface area = 50π cm² + 100π cm² = 150π cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is 150π cm²."
