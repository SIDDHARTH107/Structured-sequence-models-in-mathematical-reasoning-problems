The resources required to produce each type of product are listed in the table below:\n\n| Resources | Product A (per unit) | Product B (per unit) |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Labor     |        4 hours        |       6 hours        |\n| Materials |        8 units        |       4 units        |\n| Machines  |        2 hours        |       3 hours        |\n\nThe profit earned from the sale of each product is $10 for Product A and $12 for Product B. The company has a maximum of 2400 labor hours, 4000 units of materials, and 1200 machine hours available for production. Use linear programming to determine the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using linear programming, we need to set up the objective function and constraints. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 10x + 12y\n\nConstraints (based on available resources):\n1. Labor: 4x + 6y ≤ 2400\n2. Materials: 8x + 4y ≤ 4000\n3. Machines: 2x + 3y ≤ 1200\n4. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and identifying the vertices of the feasible region.\n\n1. Labor constraint: 4x + 6y ≤ 2400\n   y ≤ (2400 - 4x) / 6\n2. Materials constraint: 8x + 4y ≤ 4000\n   y ≤ (4000 - 8x) / 4\n3.

P(480, 0) = 10(480) + 12(0) = $4800\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, where the company produces 300 units of Product A and 200 units of Product B. The maximum profit is $5400."
