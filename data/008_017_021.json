    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrix, we first need to represent the given system of equations in matrix form. The matrix form is AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 2  3 -4 |\n    | 5 -7  8 |\n    | 4  2 -6 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  6  |\n    | -9  |\n    |  2  |\n\nNow, we can represent the coefficient matrix A as a sparse matrix. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the given matrix A is not sparse, as there are no zero elements. However, we can still solve the system of equations using the standard matrix method.\n\nFirst, we find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv):\n\nA_inv = 1/det(A) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A, and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\ndet(A) = 2(-42 + 48) - 3(20 - 32) - 4(10 + 14)\n       = 2(6) - 3(-12) - 4(24)\n       = 12 + 36 - 96\n       = -48\n\nadj(A) = | (-42 + 48)  (20 - 32)  (10 + 14) |\n         | (24 - 48)  (8 - 12)   (4 - 10)  |\n         | (14 - 28)  (4 - 6)    (2 - 10)  |\n\nadj(A) = | 6  -12  24 |\n         | -24  -4  -6 |\n         | -14  -2  -8 |\n\nNow, we can find A_inv:\n\nA_inv = 1/(-48) * |  6  -12  24 |\n                  | -24  -4  -6 |\n                  | -14  -2  -8 |\n\nA_inv = | -1/8  1/4  -1/2 |\n        |  1/2  1/12  1/8 |\n        |  7/24 1/24 1/6 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution matrix X by multiplying A_inv with B:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = | -1/8  1/4  -1/2 |  |  6  |\n    |  1/2  1/12  1/8 |  | -9  |\n    |  7/24 1/24 1/6 |  |  2  |\n\nX = | (-1/8 * 6) + (1/4 * -9) + (-1/2 * 2) |\n    | (1/2 * 6) + (1/12 * -9) + (1/8 * 2)  |\n    | (7/24 * 6) + (1/24 * -9) + (1/6 * 2) |\n\nX = | -3/4 + (-9/4) -1 |\n    | 3 - 3/4 + 1/4     |\n    | 7/4 - 3/8 + 1/3   |\n\nX = | -13/4 - 1 |\n    |  9/4       |\n    |  11/12     |\n\nX = | -15/4 |\n    |  9/4   |\n    |  11/12 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -15/4\ny = 9/4\nz = 11/12"
