    "message_2": "The Sierpinski Arrowhead Curve is a fractal that is generated by repeatedly applying a set of rules to an initial arrowhead segment. After each iteration, the total length of the curve increases.\n\nThe length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (Multiplier)^n\n\nFor the Sierpinski Arrowhead Curve, the initial length is 1 unit, and the multiplier is 3/2 (since each segment is replaced by three segments, each of length 1/2).\n\nSo, the total length of the Sierpinski Arrowhead Curve after n iterations is:\n\nLength = 1 * (3/2)^n"
