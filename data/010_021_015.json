Let $\\omega$ be a non-degenerate, closed 2-form on M. \n\nIf M is a symplectic manifold, then $\\omega$ is a symplectic form.\n\nSuppose M is a closed, connected, oriented 4-dimensional manifold with a symplectic structure $\\omega$.

    "message_2": "To show that $\\omega$ is exact, we need to find a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that $d\\alpha = \\omega$. Since M is a closed, connected, oriented 4-dimensional manifold with a symplectic structure $\\omega$, we know that $\\omega$ is closed, i.e., $d\\omega = 0$. \n\nNow, consider the Poincaré dual of $\\omega$, which is a 2-cycle $[\\Sigma] \\in H_2(M;\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\omega$ is non-degenerate, the intersection form on $H_2(M;\\mathbb{Z})$ is non-degenerate as well. In particular, this means that there exists a 2-cycle $[\\Sigma']$ such that the intersection number $[\\Sigma] \\cdot [\\Sigma'] \\neq 0$. \n\nNow, let $\\alpha$ be a 1-form such that $d\\alpha = \\omega$. Then, by Stokes' theorem, we have\n$$\n\\int_{\\Sigma'} \\omega = \\int_{\\Sigma'} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma'} \\alpha.\n$$\n\nSince M is closed, $\\partial \\Sigma' = \\emptyset$, and the integral on the right-hand side is zero. However, this contradicts the fact that the intersection number $[\\Sigma] \\cdot [\\Sigma'] \\neq 0$. Therefore, we conclude that $\\omega$ must be exact.\n\nNow, let's write down the cohomology ring of M in terms of cup products and degrees of generators. Let $H^*(M)$ denote the cohomology ring of M. Since M is a 4-dimensional manifold, we have generators in degrees 0, 2, and 4. Let $1 \\in H^0(M)$ be the unit, $x \\in H^2(M)$ be the Poincaré dual of $[\\Sigma]$, and $y \\in H^4(M)$ be the Poincaré dual of the fundamental class $[M]$. Then, the cohomology ring of M is given by\n\n$$\nH^*(M) = \\mathbb{Z}[x, y]/(x^2 = ky, y^2 = 0),\n$$\n\nwhere $k = [\\Sigma] \\cdot [\\Sigma'] \\neq 0$ is the intersection number. The cup product is determined by the relations $x^2 = ky$ and $y^2 = 0$."
