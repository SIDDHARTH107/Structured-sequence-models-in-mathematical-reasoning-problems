    "message_2": "In the given graph, we can observe the following cliques:\n\n1. {1, 2}\n2. {2, 3}\n3. {1, 4}\n4. {4, 5}\n5. {5, 6}\n6. {3, 6}\n7. {2, 5}\n\nAll of these cliques have a size of 2. There are no cliques of size 3 or more in the graph. Therefore, the clique number of the given graph is 2."
