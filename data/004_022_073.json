    "message_2": "To find the height of the cylinder with the least amount of material, we need to minimize the surface area of the cylinder while keeping the volume constant at 500 cubic centimeters.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πrh + 2πr^2, where A is the surface area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nWe are given that the volume is 500 cubic centimeters and the radius is 5 cm. We can use the volume formula to find the height:\n\n500 = π(5^2)h\n500 = 25πh\nh = 500 / (25π)\nh ≈ 6.366 cm\n\nNow we can plug this value of h back into the surface area formula to find the surface area:\n\nA = 2π(5)(6.366) + 2π(5^2)\nA ≈ 159.154 cm^2\n\nSo, the height of the cylinder that uses the least amount of material is approximately 6.366 cm, and the surface area is approximately 159.154 cm^2."
