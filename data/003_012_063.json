    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 35°, the distance from the person to the base of the tree (adjacent side) is 20 meters, and the height of the tree (opposite side) is what we want to find.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(35°) = height / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(35°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of tan(35°):\n\ntan(35°) ≈ 0.7002\n\nNow, multiply this value by 20:\n\nheight ≈ 20 * 0.7002\nheight ≈ 14.004\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the height of the tree is approximately 14.0 meters."
