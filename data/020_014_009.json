    "message_1": "Here is a question for a math student to solve related to non-convex optimization:\n\nA factory owner wants to determine the optimal mix of two products, X and Y, to produce given the following constraints:\n\n* The factory has a maximum of 500 hours for production.\n* Product X production requires 2 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor time, and has a profit of $4 per unit.\n* Product Y production requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor time, and has a profit of $6 per unit.\n* The factory can produce at most 200 units of product X and 300 units of product Y.\n\nWhat is the optimal production plan, in terms of the number of units of each product to produce, that maximizes the factory's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 4x + 6y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 500 (total production hours constraint)\n2. x ≤ 200 (maximum units of product X constraint)\n3. y ≤ 300 (maximum units of product Y constraint)\n4. x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we can simplify the total production hours constraint:\n2x + 4y ≤ 500\nx + 2y ≤ 250\n\nNow we can analyze the constraints graphically. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices A(0, 0), B(0, 125), C(100, 75), D(200, 25), and E(200, 0).\n\nWe will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nA(0, 0): P(0, 0) = 4(0) + 6(0) = $0\nB(0, 125): P(0, 125) = 4(0) + 6(125) = $750\nC(100, 75): P(100, 75) = 4(100) + 6(75) = $850\nD(200, 25): P(200, 25) = 4(200) + 6(25) = $950\nE(200, 0): P(200, 0) = 4(200) + 6(0) = $800\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point D(200, 25), with a profit of $950. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 200 units of product X and 25 units of product Y."
