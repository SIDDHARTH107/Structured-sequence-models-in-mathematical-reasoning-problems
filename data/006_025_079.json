    "message_1": "A magician has three hats, one red, one blue, and one green. The magician will randomly select a hat and randomly pick a card from a deck. If the selected hat is red and the card drawn is a queen, the magician will perform a magic trick involving doves. If the selected hat is blue and the card drawn is a jack, the magician will perform a magic trick involving rabbits. If the selected hat is green and the card drawn is a king, the magician will perform a magic trick involving fire. What is the probability that the magician will perform a magic trick involving rabbits?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the magician performing a magic trick involving rabbits, we need to determine the probability of selecting the blue hat and drawing a Jack from the deck.\n\nThere are 3 hats, so the probability of selecting the blue hat is 1/3.\n\nThere are 52 cards in a standard deck, and there are 4 Jacks (one in each suit). So, the probability of drawing a Jack is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities:\n\n(1/3) * (1/13) = 1/39\n\nSo, the probability that the magician will perform a magic trick involving rabbits is 1/39."
