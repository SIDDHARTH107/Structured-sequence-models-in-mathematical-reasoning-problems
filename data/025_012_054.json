    "message_2": "To calculate the order of the elliptic curve E over the finite field with 19 elements, we need to find the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible x values (0 to 18) and checking if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation. If there is, we count the point and its reflection across the x-axis (since the curve is symmetric).\n\nLet's go through the x values and check for corresponding y values:\n\nx = 0: $y^2 = 6$, no solution\nx = 1: $y^2 = 0$, y = 0 (1 point)\nx = 2: $y^2 = 2^3 - 7(2) + 6 = 14$, y = 6, 13 (2 points)\nx = 3: $y^2 = 3^3 - 7(3) + 6 = 9$, y = 5, 14 (2 points)\nx = 4: $y^2 = 4^3 - 7(4) + 6 = 7$, no solution\nx = 5: $y^2 = 5^3 - 7(5) + 6 = 11$, no solution\nx = 6: $y^2 = 6^3 - 7(6) + 6 = 3$, no solution\nx = 7: $y^2 = 7^3 - 7(7) + 6 = 18$, y = 7, 12 (2 points)\nx = 8: $y^2 = 8^3 - 7(8) + 6 = 15$, no solution\nx = 9: $y^2 = 9^3 - 7(9) + 6 = 10$, no solution\nx = 10: $y^2 = 10^3 - 7(10) + 6 = 5$, no solution\nx = 11: $y^2 = 11^3 - 7(11) + 6 = 0$, y = 0 (1 point)\nx = 12: $y^2 = 12^3 - 7(12) + 6 = 5$, no solution\nx = 13: $y^2 = 13^3 - 7(13) + 6 = 10$, no solution\nx = 14: $y^2 = 14^3 - 7(14) + 6 = 15$, no solution\nx = 15: $y^2 = 15^3 - 7(15) + 6 = 18$, y = 7, 12 (2 points)\nx = 16: $y^2 = 16^3 - 7(16) + 6 = 3$, no solution\nx = 17: $y^2 = 17^3 - 7(17) + 6 = 11$, no solution\nx = 18: $y^2 = 18^3 - 7(18) + 6 = 7$, no solution\n\nWe found 1 point for x = 1, 2 points for x = 2, 2 points for x = 3, 2 points for x = 7, 1 point for x = 11, and 2 points for x = 15. This gives us a total of 10 points. Including the point at infinity, the order of the elliptic curve E is 11."
