    "message_1": "A ferris wheel has a diameter of 20 meters and makes one revolution every 40 seconds. A person is seated at the bottom of the wheel and the height of the person above the ground is modeled by the function, h(t) = 10sin(π/20t) + 15, where t is the time in seconds. Find the period and amplitude of the function.",
    "message_2": "The given function is h(t) = 10sin(π/20t) + 15. This is a sinusoidal function of the form h(t) = Asin(Bt) + C, where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, A = 10, B = π/20, and C = 15.\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of A, which is |10| = 10.\n\nTo find the period of the function, we need to determine the time it takes for the function to complete one full cycle. The period is given by the formula P = 2π/B.\n\nIn this case, B = π/20, so the period P = 2π/(π/20) = 2π * (20/π) = 40 seconds.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function is 10 and the period is 40 seconds."
