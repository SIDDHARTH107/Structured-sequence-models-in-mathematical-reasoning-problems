    "message_1": "A company claims that their new weight loss program can help their clients lose, on average, at least 5 pounds in a month with a standard deviation of 1.5 pounds. A sample of 25 clients was taken, and their average weight loss was 4.6 pounds. Is there enough evidence to reject the company's claim? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is enough evidence to reject the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average weight loss is at least 5 pounds, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average weight loss is less than 5 pounds.\n\nH0: μ ≥ 5\nH1: μ < 5\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample mean (x̄) = 4.6 pounds\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 1.5 pounds\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is 25, we can use the t-distribution. First, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) and the t-score.\n\nSE = σ / √n\nSE = 1.5 / √25\nSE = 1.5 / 5\nSE = 0.3\n\nNow, we calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / SE\nt = (4.6 - 5) / 0.3\nt = -0.4 / 0.3\nt = -1.333\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.711.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-1.333) is greater than the critical t-value (-1.711), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to reject the company's claim that their weight loss program can help clients lose at least 5 pounds in a month at a significance level of 0.05."
