    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the Hopf map, we first need to understand its properties and behavior. The Hopf map h: S^3 -> S^2 is a continuous map from the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere. The 3-sphere S^3 can be parameterized by two complex numbers z and w such that |z|^2 + |w|^2 = 1. The Hopf map is defined as:\n\nh(z, w) = (2Re(zw), 2Im(zw), |z|^2 - |w|^2)\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of the Hopf map. The degree of a map between two spheres is an integer that measures the number of times the domain sphere wraps around the target sphere. It can be computed using the formula:\n\ndegree(h) = (1 / Vol(S^2)) * ∫_S^3 h^*(ω)\n\nwhere ω is the volume form on S^2, and h^*(ω) is the pullback of ω by the map h.\n\nThe volume form ω on S^2 can be given by:\n\nω = sin(θ) dθ ∧ dφ\n\nwhere θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively.\n\nTo compute the pullback h^*(ω), we need to express θ and φ in terms of z and w. We can do this by first expressing the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of a point on S^2 in terms of z and w:\n\nx = 2Re(zw) = 2(zw + z̅w̅)\ny = 2Im(zw) = 2i(zw - z̅w̅)\nz = |z|^2 - |w|^2\n\nNow, we can express θ and φ as:\n\ncos(θ) = z\nφ = arg(x + iy)\n\nNow, we can compute the pullback h^*(ω):\n\nh^*(ω) = h^*(sin(θ) dθ ∧ dφ) = sin(acos(z)) dz ∧ d(arg(x + iy))\n\nTo compute the integral of h^*(ω) over S^3, we can use the fact that the Hopf map is a fibration with fibers being circles. The integral of h^*(ω) over each fiber circle is equal to 2π. Since there are two such circles for each point on S^2, the integral of h^*(ω) over S^3 is equal to 4π times the volume of S^2.\n\nFinally, we can compute the degree of the Hopf map:\n\ndegree(h) = (1 / Vol(S^2)) * ∫_S^3 h^*(ω) = (1 / (4π)) * (4π * Vol(S^2)) = Vol(S^2)\n\nSince the volume of S^2 is 1, the degree of the Hopf map is 1."
