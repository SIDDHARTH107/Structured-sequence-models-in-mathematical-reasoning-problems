    "message_2": "There are two possible groups of order 6 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C6 and the dihedral group D3 (also known as D6 in some notations). \n\nC6 is generated by a single element, say a, and has the following elements: {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}, where a^6 = 1. The group operation is the multiplication of the powers of a modulo 6.\n\nD3 is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle, and it has 6 elements: {1, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}, where r is a rotation by 120 degrees, r^2 is a rotation by 240 degrees, s is a reflection, and sr and sr^2 are the other two reflections. The group operation is the composition of these symmetries.\n\nTo determine whether a given group of order 6 is isomorphic to C6 or D3, we can use the following criteria:\n\n1. If the group is generated by a single element (i.e., it is cyclic), then it is isomorphic to C6.\n2. If the group has an element of order 2 (e.g., a reflection in the case of D3) and an element of order 3 (e.g., a rotation in the case of D3), then it is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn general, to show that two groups are isomorphic, we need to find a bijective function (an isomorphism) between the two groups that preserves the group operation. In the case of C6 and D3, we can explicitly construct such an isomorphism by mapping the generator of C6 to an element of order 6 in D3 (e.g., a rotation), and then extending this map to the other elements in a way that preserves the group operation."
