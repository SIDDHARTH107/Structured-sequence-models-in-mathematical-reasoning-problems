    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression $\\log_4 64 - \\log_4 8$, we can use the logarithmic property: $\\log_b a - \\log_b c = \\log_b \\frac{a}{c}$. \n\nApplying this property, we get:\n\n$\\log_4 64 - \\log_4 8 = \\log_4 \\frac{64}{8}$\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction:\n\n$\\frac{64}{8} = 8$\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n$\\log_4 8$\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent to which 4 must be raised to get 8. In other words, we need to find x in the equation $4^x = 8$. \n\nSince $4^1 = 4$ and $4^2 = 16$, we know that the value of x lies between 1 and 2. We can rewrite 8 as $4 \\times 2 = 4^1 \\times 2^1$. Now, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$4^x = 4^1 \\times 2^1$\n\nSince the bases are the same (4), we can equate the exponents:\n\n$x = 1 + \\log_4 2$\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent to which 4 must be raised to get 2. In other words, we need to find y in the equation $4^y = 2$. \n\nSince $4^1 = 4$ and $4^0 = 1$, we know that the value of y lies between 0 and 1. We can rewrite 2 as $\\sqrt{4} = 4^{1/2}$. Now, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$4^y = 4^{1/2}$\n\nSince the bases are the same (4), we can equate the exponents:\n\n$y = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\n$\\log_4 8 = 1 + \\log_4 2 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$"
