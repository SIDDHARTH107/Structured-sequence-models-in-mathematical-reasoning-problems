    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation $\\sqrt{x+5}=7$, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n$(\\sqrt{x+5})^2 = 7^2$\n\nStep 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.\n$x+5 = 49$\n\nStep 3: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate x.\n$x = 49 - 5$\n\nStep 4: Simplify to find the value of x.\n$x = 44$\n\nSo, the solution for x in the equation $\\sqrt{x+5}=7$ is $x=44$."
