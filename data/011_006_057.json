    "message_2": "To find the number of possible outcomes where the number of heads is even, we can use the binomial coefficient formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of flips (7 in this case), k is the number of heads, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSince we want an even number of heads, we can have 0, 2, 4, or 6 heads. We will calculate the binomial coefficient for each of these cases and sum them up.\n\nC(7, 0) = 7! / (0!(7-0)!) = 1\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!) = (7 × 6) / (2 × 1) = 21\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!(7-4)!) = 7! / (4!3!) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 35\nC(7, 6) = 7! / (6!(7-6)!) = 7! / (6!1!) = 7\n\nNow, we sum up these values:\n\n1 + 21 + 35 + 7 = 64\n\nSo there are 64 possible outcomes where the number of heads is even when flipping a coin 7 times."
