Assume the market demand function is given by P = 50 - Q, where P is the price of the product and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. The cost functions for firms A and B are given by C₁(Q₁) = 10Q₁ and C₂(Q₂) = 20Q₂ respectively, where C₁ and C₂ are the costs incurred by firms A and B and Q₁ and Q₂ are the quantities produced respectively.\n\nWhat quantity will each firm produce if they behave as Cournot competitors? What will be the market price and total profit for each firm?",
    "message_2": "To find the quantity produced by each firm as Cournot competitors, we first need to find the reaction functions for each firm. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nLet's start with firm A. Firm A's profit function (π₁) is given by:\n\nπ₁(Q₁, Q₂) = P * Q₁ - C₁(Q₁) = (50 - Q) * Q₁ - 10Q₁\n\nwhere Q = Q₁ + Q₂.\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order condition (FOC) for firm A's profit maximization:\n\n∂π₁/∂Q₁ = ∂((50 - Q₁ - Q₂) * Q₁ - 10Q₁)/∂Q₁ = 0\n\nSolving for Q₁, we get firm A's reaction function:\n\nQ₁ = (40 - Q₂)/2\n\nNow, let's find firm B's reaction function. Firm B's profit function (π₂) is given by:\n\nπ₂(Q₁, Q₂) = P * Q₂ - C₂(Q₂) = (50 - Q) * Q₂ - 20Q₂\n\nAgain, we need to find the first-order condition (FOC) for firm B's profit maximization:\n\n∂π₂/∂Q₂ = ∂((50 - Q₁ - Q₂) * Q₂ - 20Q₂)/∂Q₂ = 0\n\nSolving for Q₂, we get firm B's reaction function:\n\nQ₂ = (30 - Q₁)/2\n\nNow, we need to solve these two reaction functions simultaneously to find the Cournot equilibrium quantities:\n\nQ₁ = (40 - Q₂)/2\nQ₂ = (30 - Q₁)/2\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nQ₁ = 20\nQ₂ = 10\n\nSo, in the Cournot equilibrium, firm A will produce 20 units, and firm B will produce 10 units.\n\nNow, let's find the market price and total profit for each firm. The market price is given by the demand function:\n\nP = 50 - Q = 50 - (Q₁ + Q₂) = 50 - (20 + 10) = 20\n\nFirm A's total profit is:\n\nπ₁ = P * Q₁ - C₁(Q₁) = 20 * 20 - 10 * 20 = 400 - 200 = 200\n\nFirm B's total profit is:\n\nπ₂ = P * Q₂ - C₂(Q₂) = 20 * 10 - 20 * 10 = 200 - 200 = 0\n\nIn conclusion, as Cournot competitors, firm A will produce 20 units and firm B will produce 10 units. The market price will be 20, with firm A making a total profit of 200 and firm B making a total profit of 0."
