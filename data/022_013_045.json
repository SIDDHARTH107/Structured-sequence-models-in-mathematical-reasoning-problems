    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of |f(z)| over the boundary of the disk, we need to evaluate f(z) on the circle |z| = 2. Let z = 2e^(iθ), where θ is the angle in radians and 0 ≤ θ < 2π. Then:\n\nf(z) = (2e^(iθ))² + i(2e^(iθ)) + 1\n     = 4e^(2iθ) + 2ie^(iθ) + 1\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |4e^(2iθ) + 2ie^(iθ) + 1|\n\nTo simplify this expression, let's use the polar form of complex numbers:\n\n|f(z)| = |4(cos(2θ) + i*sin(2θ)) + 2i(cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)) + 1|\n       = |(4cos(2θ) + 1) + (4sin(2θ) + 2sin(θ))i|\n\nNow we have the magnitude of f(z) in terms of θ:\n\n|f(z)|² = (4cos(2θ) + 1)² + (4sin(2θ) + 2sin(θ))²\n\nTo find the maximum value of |f(z)|, we can find the maximum value of |f(z)|² (since the square root function is monotonic). We can do this by taking the derivative with respect to θ and setting it to zero:\n\nd(|f(z)|²)/dθ = 0\n\nAfter taking the derivative and simplifying, we get:\n\n-32cos(θ)sin(θ) + 16sin(θ)cos(θ) - 8sin(θ) = 0\n\nDivide by -8:\n\n4cos(θ)sin(θ) - 2sin(θ)cos(θ) + sin(θ) = 0\nsin(θ)(2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possibilities: sin(θ) = 0 or 2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1 = 0. The first case, sin(θ) = 0, corresponds to θ = 0 or θ = π. The second case, 2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1 = 0, corresponds to cos(θ) = 1/2, which gives θ = 2π/3 or θ = 4π/3.\n\nNow we can plug these values of θ back into the expression for |f(z)|²:\n\n1. θ = 0: |f(z)|² = (4(1) + 1)² + (4(0) + 2(0))² = 25\n2. θ = π: |f(z)|² = (4(-1) + 1)² + (4(0) + 2(0))² = 9\n3. θ = 2π/3: |f(z)|² = (4(-1/2) + 1)² + (4(√3/2) + 2(√3/2))² ≈ 36.75\n4. θ = 4π/3: |f(z)|² = (4(1/2) + 1)² + (4(-√3/2) + 2(-√3/2))² ≈ 36.75\n\nThe maximum value of |f(z)|² is approximately 36.75, so the maximum value of |f(z)| is approximately √36.75 ≈ 6.06."
