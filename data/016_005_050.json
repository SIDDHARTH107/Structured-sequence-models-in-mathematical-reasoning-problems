    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. Let's analyze the number of line segments at each iteration:\n\n1. Initial segment (0th iteration): 1 segment of length 3\n2. 1st iteration: 2 segments, each of length 1\n3. 2nd iteration: 2 * 2 = 4 segments, each of length 1/3\n4. 3rd iteration: 2 * 4 = 8 segments, each of length 1/9\n5. 4th iteration: 2 * 8 = 16 segments, each of length 1/27\n\nSo, up to the 4th iteration, there are a total of 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 line segments."
