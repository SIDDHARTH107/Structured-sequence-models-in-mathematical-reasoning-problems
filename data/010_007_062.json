Let $p$ be the projection map that collapses the entire upper hemisphere to the point $(0,1)$, and let $U$ be an open set containing $(0,1)$. Find the fundamental group of the space $p^{-1}(U)$.",
    "message_2": "Let's first analyze the space $p^{-1}(U)$. Since $U$ is an open set containing $(0,1)$, it must contain an open neighborhood around $(0,1)$. Let's consider an open disk $D$ centered at $(0,1)$ with radius $r$ such that $D \\subseteq U$. Then, $p^{-1}(D)$ will contain the entire upper hemisphere, as well as a small open region around the equator of the unit circle.\n\nNow, let's consider the space $X$ with the upper hemisphere collapsed to a point. This space is homeomorphic to the unit circle with a small open region around the equator removed. To see this, imagine \"stretching\" the collapsed upper hemisphere point along the equator until it becomes an open interval.\n\nLet $Y$ be the space obtained by removing the small open region around the equator from the unit circle. Then, $p^{-1}(U)$ is homeomorphic to $Y$. We can now compute the fundamental group of $Y$.\n\nThe space $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle. To see this, consider a deformation retract of $Y$ onto the circle by \"shrinking\" the removed open region around the equator to a single point. The resulting space is a circle, which has a fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince $p^{-1}(U)$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, their fundamental groups are isomorphic. Therefore, the fundamental group of $p^{-1}(U)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$."
