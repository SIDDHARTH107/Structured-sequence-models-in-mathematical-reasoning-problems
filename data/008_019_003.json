    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of linear equations:\n\n(1) x + 2y + 3z = 5 + 3i\n(2) 2x - 3y + 5z = -2 + 4i\n(3) x + y + z = 1 + i\n\nWe will eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (3) by 2 and then subtract it from equation (2):\n\n(4) (2x - 3y + 5z) - (2x + 2y + 2z) = (-2 + 4i) - (2 + 2i)\n(4) -5y + 3z = -4 + 2i\n\nNow, we will eliminate x from equations (1) and (3). To do this, we will subtract equation (3) from equation (1):\n\n(5) (x + 2y + 3z) - (x + y + z) = (5 + 3i) - (1 + i)\n(5) y + 2z = 4 + 2i\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n(4) -5y + 3z = -4 + 2i\n(5) y + 2z = 4 + 2i\n\nWe will eliminate y from equations (4) and (5). To do this, we will multiply equation (5) by 5 and then add it to equation (4):\n\n(6) (-5y + 3z) + (5y + 10z) = (-4 + 2i) + (20 + 10i)\n(6) 13z = 16 + 12i\n\nNow, we will solve equation (6) for z:\n\nz = (16 + 12i) / 13\nz = 16/13 + (12/13)i\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into equation (5) to find the value of y:\n\ny + 2(16/13 + (12/13)i) = 4 + 2i\ny = 4 + 2i - 32/13 - (24/13)i\ny = (20/13) + (2/13)i\n\nFinally, we will substitute the values of y and z back into equation (3) to find the value of x:\n\nx + (20/13 + (2/13)i) + (16/13 + (12/13)i) = 1 + i\nx = 1 + i - 36/13 - (14/13)i\nx = (-23/13) + (1/13)i\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = (-23/13) + (1/13)i\ny = (20/13) + (2/13)i\nz = 16/13 + (12/13)i"
