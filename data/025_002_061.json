    "message_1": "Consider the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $C$ be the curve of intersection of this variety with the plane $z = 1$. Determine the number of intersection points of $C$ with the plane $y = 1$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the equation of the curve $C$. Since $C$ is the intersection of the variety $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4$ with the plane $z = 1$, we can substitute $z = 1$ into the equation of the variety:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + 1^2 = 4$\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the curve $C$:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 = 3$\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection points of $C$ with the plane $y = 1$. Substitute $y = 1$ into the equation of the curve $C$:\n\n$x^2 + 1^2 = 3$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$x^2 = 2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get two possible values for $x$:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{2}$ and $x = -\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, there are two intersection points of the curve $C$ with the plane $y = 1$. These points are $(\\sqrt{2}, 1, 1)$ and $(-\\sqrt{2}, 1, 1)$."
