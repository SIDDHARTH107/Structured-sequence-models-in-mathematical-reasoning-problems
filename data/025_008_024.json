    "message_2": "To determine the value of n, we need to use the Hodge decomposition theorem for complex projective varieties. The Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a complex projective variety X of dimension n, the k-th cohomology group H^k(X) can be decomposed as a direct sum of Hodge components:\n\nH^k(X) = ⊕_(p+q=k) H^(p,q)(X)\n\nHere, H^(p,q)(X) denotes the (p,q)-Hodge component, and h^(p,q)(X) is the Hodge number, which is the dimension of H^(p,q)(X).\n\nWe are given that the dimension of H^k(X) is 5, and the Hodge number h^(p,q)(X) equals 3 for p+q=k. Since the Hodge decomposition is a direct sum, the sum of the dimensions of all Hodge components with p+q=k must equal the dimension of H^k(X). Therefore, we have:\n\n5 = h^(p,q)(X) + h^(p-1,q+1)(X) + ... + h^(0,k)(X)\n\nSince h^(p,q)(X) = 3 for p+q=k, there must be two non-zero Hodge components with p+q=k, each having dimension 3. This implies that there are two Hodge components with dimensions 3 and 2, respectively, and all other Hodge components with p+q=k have dimension 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the Hodge symmetry property, which states that h^(p,q)(X) = h^(q,p)(X). Since there are two non-zero Hodge components with p+q=k, we have:\n\nh^(p,q)(X) = h^(q,p)(X) = 3\nh^(p-1,q+1)(X) = h^(q-1,p+1)(X) = 2\n\nSince h^(p,q)(X) = h^(q,p)(X), we must have p=q. Therefore, we have:\n\nh^(p,p)(X) = 3\nh^(p-1,p+1)(X) = 2\n\nSince p+q=k, we have 2p=k and 2p+2=k. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get p=1 and k=2. Thus, the non-zero Hodge components are H^(1,1)(X) and H^(0,2)(X).\n\nNow, we can use the Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes, which states that the rank of the intersection form on H^(1,1)(X) is equal to the Picard number, which is at least 1 for a complex projective variety. Since H^(1,1)(X) has dimension 3, the Picard number is at least 3.\n\nFinally, we use the Künneth formula for the cohomology of a product of varieties. If X is a product of complex projective varieties Y and Z, then the Künneth formula states that:\n\nH^k(X) = ⊕_(p+q=k) (H^p(Y) ⊗ H^q(Z))\n\nSince the Picard number of X is at least 3, X cannot be a product of two lower-dimensional varieties with Picard number 1. Therefore, X must be an irreducible variety, and its dimension n must be equal to the sum of the indices of the non-zero Hodge components:\n\nn = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the value of n is 2."
