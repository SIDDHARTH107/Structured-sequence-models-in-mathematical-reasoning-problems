    "message_2": "To find the expected change in the stock price, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding change in the stock price and then add the results together.\n\nExpected change = (Probability of going up * Change when going up) + (Probability of going down * Change when going down)\n\nExpected change = (0.60 * $2) + (0.40 * -$1)\n\nExpected change = ($1.20) + (-$0.40)\n\nExpected change = $0.80\n\nThe expected change in the stock price is $0.80."
