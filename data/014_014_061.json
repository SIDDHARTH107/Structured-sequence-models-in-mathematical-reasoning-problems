    "message_2": "First, we need to create a 5x5 matrix using the key \"CRYPTO\" and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, as it is usually combined with I in the Playfair cipher).\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: CRYPTO -> CRYPT\n2. Create the matrix by filling in the key and the remaining letters:\n\n   C  R  Y  P  T\n   O  A  B  D  E\n   F  G  H  I  K\n   L  M  N  S  U\n   V  W  X  Z  Q\n\n3. Separate the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an X between them. If the message has an odd number of characters, add an X at the end:\n\n   MA  TH  IS  FU  NX\n\n4. Encrypt each digraph using the matrix:\n\n   - MA: M is in row 4, column 2, and A is in row 2, column 3. So, the encrypted digraph is LN (row 4, column 3 and row 2, column 2).\n   - TH: T is in row 1, column 5, and H is in row 3, column 4. So, the encrypted digraph is YI (row 1, column 4 and row 3, column 5).\n   - IS: I is in row 3, column 5, and S is in row 4, column 4. So, the encrypted digraph is HN (row 3, column 4 and row 4, column 5).\n   - FU: F is in row 3, column 1, and U is in row 4, column 5. So, the encrypted digraph is FV (row 3, column 5 and row 4, column 1).\n   - NX: N is in row 4, column 3, and X is in row 5, column 3. So, the encrypted digraph is NZ (row 4, column 5 and row 5, column 3).\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message:\n\n   LN YI HN FV NZ"
