    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum number of edges required to connect all 10 vertices. A tree (a connected graph with no cycles) with 10 vertices will have 10 - 1 = 9 edges. \n\nNow, let's consider the additional edges. We have 18 - 9 = 9 extra edges. Adding these extra edges will create cycles and reduce the distance between some pairs of vertices. \n\nIn the worst-case scenario, we can add these extra edges in such a way that they do not reduce the distance between the vertices that are farthest apart. For example, we can add these extra edges to form a complete graph on a subset of vertices, while keeping the longest path in the graph unchanged.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario:\n\n1. Add 3 extra edges to form a complete graph on 4 vertices. The longest path in the graph is still between the two vertices that are not part of this complete graph, with a distance of 4.\n\n2. Add 5 extra edges to form a complete graph on 5 vertices. The longest path in the graph is still between the two vertices that are not part of this complete graph, with a distance of 5.\n\n3. Add 1 extra edge to form a complete graph on 6 vertices. The longest path in the graph is still between the two vertices that are not part of this complete graph, with a distance of 6.\n\nNow, we have used all the 9 extra edges, and the longest path in the graph is still 6. Therefore, the diameter of the graph is at most 6.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the actual diameter is smaller than 6, depending on how the edges are distributed in the graph. To find the actual diameter, we would need more information about the specific graph. But based on the given information, we can conclude that the diameter of the graph is at most 6."
