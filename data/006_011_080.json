    "message_1": "In a factory, there are 50 workers and the probability of each worker having an accident in a year is 0.05. What is the probability that exactly 3 workers will have an accident in a year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that exactly 3 workers will have an accident in a year, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, accidents)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of workers, which is 50)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of accidents, which is 3)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an accident, which is 0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of no accident, which is 0.95)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(50, 3) * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^47\n\nC(50, 3) can be calculated as:\n\nC(50, 3) = 50! / (3! * (50-3)!)\nC(50, 3) = 50! / (3! * 47!)\nC(50, 3) = 19600\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 3) = 19600 * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^47\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.243\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 workers will have an accident in a year is approximately 0.243 or 24.3%."
