    "message_2": "We are looking for the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 4 (mod 9)\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences. First, we find the product of the moduli: N = 5 * 7 * 9 = 315.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N / 5 = 315 / 5 = 63\nN2 = N / 7 = 315 / 7 = 45\nN3 = N / 9 = 315 / 9 = 35\n\nNow we need to find the modular inverses:\n\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 5) = 63^(-1) (mod 5) = 3\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 7) = 45^(-1) (mod 7) = 5\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 9) = 35^(-1) (mod 9) = 2\n\nNow we can compute the solution:\n\nx = (2 * N1 * y1 + 3 * N2 * y2 + 4 * N3 * y3) (mod N)\nx = (2 * 63 * 3 + 3 * 45 * 5 + 4 * 35 * 2) (mod 315)\nx = (378 + 675 + 280) (mod 315)\nx = 1333 (mod 315)\n\nThe smallest positive integer x that satisfies the given congruences is x = 1333 % 315 = 68."
