    "message_1": "A store has two types of bags, one costing \\$5 and the other costing \\$10. A customer needs to purchase 5 bags in total, but they have a budget of only \\$35. Assuming the customer wants to maximize the number of bags they can purchase, how many bags of each type should they buy?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of $5 bags and y be the number of $10 bags. We have the following equations:\n\nx + y = 5 (total number of bags)\n5x + 10y = 35 (total cost)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the number of bags of each type the customer should buy:\n\nFirst, we can solve for x in the first equation:\n\nx = 5 - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n5(5 - y) + 10y = 35\n\n25 - 5y + 10y = 35\n\n5y = 10\n\ny = 2\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 5 - 2\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the customer should buy 3 bags of the $5 type and 2 bags of the $10 type to maximize the number of bags they can purchase within their budget."
