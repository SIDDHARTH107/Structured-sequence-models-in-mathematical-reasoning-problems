    "message_1": "A study found that 75% of students who studied for at least 2 hours before the exam scored an 'A'. Out of the students who scored an 'A', 80% had studied for at least 2 hours. What is the probability that a student who did not study for at least 2 hours scored an 'A'?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that a student scores an 'A', and B be the event that a student studies for at least 2 hours. We are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A|B) = 0.75 (probability of scoring an 'A' given that the student studied for at least 2 hours)\nP(B|A) = 0.80 (probability of studying for at least 2 hours given that the student scored an 'A')\n\nWe want to find P(A|B'), where B' is the event that a student did not study for at least 2 hours.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we have:\n\nP(A|B') = P(B'|A) * P(A) / P(B')\n\nFirst, we need to find P(B') and P(A). We know that:\n\nP(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|B') * P(B')\n\nSince P(B|A) = 0.80, we can find P(B) using the formula:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(A|B) = 0.80 * P(A) / 0.75\n\nNow, we know that P(B) + P(B') = 1, so:\n\nP(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - (0.80 * P(A) / 0.75)\n\nSubstituting this expression for P(B') into the equation for P(A):\n\nP(A) = 0.75 * P(B) + P(A|B') * (1 - (0.80 * P(A) / 0.75))\n\nNow we can solve for P(A|B'):\n\nP(A|B') = (P(A) - 0.75 * P(B)) / (1 - (0.80 * P(A) / 0.75))\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to find the exact value of P(A) or P(A|B'). We need more information about the overall probability of scoring an 'A' or the proportion of students who studied for at least 2 hours."
