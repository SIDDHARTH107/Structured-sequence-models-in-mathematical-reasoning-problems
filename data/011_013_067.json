    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MISSISSIPPI\" without any restrictions. There are 11 letters in total, with 4 S's, 4 I's, 2 P's, and 1 M. So, the total number of arrangements is:\n\n11! / (4! * 4! * 2! * 1!) = 34,650\n\nNow, let's find the number of arrangements where at least one pair of adjacent letters are the same. We can do this by treating each pair of identical adjacent letters as a single entity.\n\n1. Two adjacent S's: We have 3 pairs of S's (SS, SS, SS), 2 I's, 2 P's, and 1 M. We can arrange these 7 entities in 7! ways. However, we have to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 pairs of S's among themselves, which is 3! ways. So, there are 7! / 3! = 5,040 arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent S's.\n\n2. Two adjacent I's: We have 3 pairs of I's (II, II, II), 4 S's, 2 P's, and 1 M. We can arrange these 7 entities in 7! ways. However, we have to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 pairs of I's among themselves, which is 3! ways. So, there are 7! / 3! = 5,040 arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent I's.\n\nNow, we have to subtract the arrangements where both conditions (1) and (2) are satisfied, i.e., there are at least one pair of adjacent S's and at least one pair of adjacent I's.\n\n3. Two adjacent S's and two adjacent I's: We have 2 pairs of S's (SS, SS), 2 pairs of I's (II, II), 2 P's, and 1 M. We can arrange these 6 entities in 6! ways. However, we have to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 2 pairs of S's among themselves (2! ways) and the number of ways to arrange the 2 pairs of I's among themselves (2! ways). So, there are 6! / (2! * 2!) = 360 arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent S's and at least one pair of adjacent I's.\n\nUsing the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of arrangements where no two adjacent letters are the same is:\n\nTotal arrangements - Arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent S's - Arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent I's + Arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent S's and at least one pair of adjacent I's\n\n34,650 - 5,040 - 5,040 + 360 = 24,930\n\nSo, there are 24,930 ways to rearrange the letters of the word \"MISSISSIPPI\" such that no two adjacent letters are the same."
