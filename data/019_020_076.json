The best-case time complexity of such an algorithm is O(nlogn). \n\nIf the time complexity of a comparison-based sorting algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst case, what is the maximum number of elements it can sort in 1 second, given that the algorithm runs on a computer with a clock speed of 3 GHz and it takes 10 clock cycles to execute a comparison?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find out how many comparisons can be executed in 1 second.\n\nA computer with a clock speed of 3 GHz can perform 3 * 10^9 cycles per second. Since it takes 10 clock cycles to execute a comparison, the computer can perform (3 * 10^9) / 10 = 3 * 10^8 comparisons per second.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case time complexity of the comparison-based sorting algorithm, which is O(n^2). We want to find the maximum number of elements (n) that can be sorted in 1 second.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\nn^2 <= 3 * 10^8\n\nNow, we need to solve for n:\n\nn <= sqrt(3 * 10^8)\n\nn <= sqrt(3 * 10^8) â‰ˆ 30886\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements that the algorithm can sort in 1 second is approximately 30,886."
