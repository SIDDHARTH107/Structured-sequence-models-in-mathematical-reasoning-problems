    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, player 1 has $10 and can choose to send any amount x to player 2. Whatever amount is sent will triple during the transfer, that is player 2 will receive 3x, and then player 2 will decide how much of that tripled amount to return to player 1, say y. What is the maximum amount that player 1 should send given that player 1 trusts player 2 to return at least $10?",
    "message_2": "Since player 1 trusts player 2 to return at least $10, we need to find the maximum amount x that player 1 can send so that player 2 has enough to return $10 to player 1.\n\nLet's set up an equation to represent this situation:\n\n3x - y = 10\n\nSince player 1 wants to maximize the amount sent (x), we need to find the maximum value of x that still allows player 2 to return at least $10 (y â‰¥ 10).\n\nPlayer 1 has $10, so the maximum amount they can send is x = 10. In this case, player 2 would receive 3x = 3(10) = $30. If player 2 returns $10, the equation becomes:\n\n3(10) - 10 = 10\n\n30 - 10 = 10\n\n20 = 10\n\nThis equation is not true, so player 1 cannot send the full $10.\n\nLet's try x = $9. In this case, player 2 would receive 3x = 3(9) = $27. If player 2 returns $10, the equation becomes:\n\n3(9) - 10 = 10\n\n27 - 10 = 10\n\n17 = 10\n\nThis equation is also not true, so player 1 cannot send $9.\n\nLet's try x = $8. In this case, player 2 would receive 3x = 3(8) = $24. If player 2 returns $10, the equation becomes:\n\n3(8) - 10 = 10\n\n24 - 10 = 10\n\n14 = 10\n\nThis equation is not true either, so player 1 cannot send $8.\n\nLet's try x = $7. In this case, player 2 would receive 3x = 3(7) = $21. If player 2 returns $10, the equation becomes:\n\n3(7) - 10 = 10\n\n21 - 10 = 10\n\n11 = 10\n\nThis equation is not true, so player 1 cannot send $7.\n\nFinally, let's try x = $6. In this case, player 2 would receive 3x = 3(6) = $18. If player 2 returns $10, the equation becomes:\n\n3(6) - 10 = 10\n\n18 - 10 = 10\n\n8 = 10\n\nThis equation is not true, but if player 2 returns $8, the equation becomes:\n\n3(6) - 8 = 10\n\n18 - 8 = 10\n\n10 = 10\n\nThis equation is true. So, the maximum amount that player 1 should send is $6, as it allows player 2 to return at least $10."
