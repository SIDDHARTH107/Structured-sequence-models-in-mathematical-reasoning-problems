    "message_2": "An elliptic curve is defined by the equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + ax + b\n\nGiven the parameters a = 4 and b = 8, the equation becomes:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 4x + 8\n\nNow, we need to verify that the point (2, 6) lies on the curve. We can do this by plugging the coordinates into the equation:\n\n(6)^2 = (2)^3 + 4(2) + 8\n\n36 = 8 + 8 + 8\n\n36 = 24\n\nSince 36 â‰  24, the point (2, 6) does not lie on the elliptic curve with parameters a = 4 and b = 8. Therefore, there is no elliptic curve with the given parameters and point."
