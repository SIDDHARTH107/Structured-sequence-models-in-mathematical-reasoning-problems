    "message_1": "A manufacturer is trying to determine the optimal combination of four factors (A, B, C, and D) that will produce the best quality product. Each factor has three levels: low (L), medium (M), and high (H). The manufacturer decides to use an L9(3^4) orthogonal array to conduct their experiments. If the manufacturer runs three replicates of the experiment, how many total runs will they have to conduct?",
    "message_2": "An L9(3^4) orthogonal array means that there are 9 different combinations of the four factors (A, B, C, and D) at their three levels (L, M, H). If the manufacturer runs three replicates of the experiment, they will have to conduct a total of 9 combinations x 3 replicates = 27 runs."
