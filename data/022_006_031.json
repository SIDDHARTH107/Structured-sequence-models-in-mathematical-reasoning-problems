    "message_2": "We can use the Maximum Modulus Principle to solve this problem. The Maximum Modulus Principle states that if a function is analytic in a region and continuous on its boundary, then the maximum value of the absolute value of the function occurs on the boundary of the region.\n\nLet $g(z) = f(z) - f(6+3i)$. Then, $g(z)$ is also analytic in the region $D$, and $|g(z)| \\leq 4$ for all $z \\in D$. Furthermore, $g(6+3i) = 0$. Now, consider the function $h(z) = 1/g(z)$. This function is also analytic in $D$, and $h(6+3i) = 1/g(6+3i) = 1/0$, which is undefined.\n\nHowever, we can define a new region $D'$ that is the same as $D$ but with the point $6+3i$ removed. In this region, $h(z)$ is analytic, and by the Maximum Modulus Principle, the maximum value of $|h(z)|$ occurs on the boundary of $D'$. Since $|g(z)| \\leq 4$, we have $|h(z)| \\geq 1/4$ for all $z \\in D'$.\n\nNow, let's consider the limit as $z$ approaches $6+3i$ in $D'$. Since $h(z)$ is analytic in $D'$, it is continuous in $D'$, and we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 6+3i} |h(z)| \\geq \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 6+3i} |g(z)| \\leq 4$$\n\nSince $g(z) = f(z) - f(6+3i)$, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 6+3i} |f(z) - f(6+3i)| \\leq 4$$\n\nThis implies that the maximum possible absolute value of $f(6+3i)$ is $4$."
