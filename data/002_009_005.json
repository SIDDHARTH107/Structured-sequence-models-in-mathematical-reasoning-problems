    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr(h + r)\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the height (h) is 10 cm and the radius (r) is 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 2 × 3.14159 × 3 × (10 + 3)\n\nSurface Area = 2 × 3.14159 × 3 × 13\n\nSurface Area ≈ 246.74016\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 246.7 square centimeters."
