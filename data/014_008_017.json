    "message_1": "Suppose you have a 64-bit block of plaintext that you want to encrypt using a block cipher with a block size of 128 bits. How many rounds of encryption will you need to perform to encrypt the entire plaintext block using a 128-bit block cipher?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt a 64-bit block of plaintext using a 128-bit block cipher, you will need to pad the plaintext to fit the block size of the cipher. Since the block cipher has a size of 128 bits, and the plaintext is 64 bits, you will need to add 64 bits of padding to the plaintext.\n\nAfter padding the plaintext, you will have a single 128-bit block. Therefore, you will need to perform only 1 round of encryption to encrypt the entire plaintext block using a 128-bit block cipher."
