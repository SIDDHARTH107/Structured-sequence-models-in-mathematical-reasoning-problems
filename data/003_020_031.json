    "message_1": "A ladder positioned against a wall makes an angle of 60 degrees with the ground. If the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall, how long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. In this case, we have the angle (60 degrees) and the adjacent side (6 feet) and we want to find the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder).\n\ncos(60) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(60) = 6 / ladder length\n\nNow, we can solve for the ladder length:\n\nladder length = 6 / cos(60)\n\nSince cos(60) = 0.5:\n\nladder length = 6 / 0.5\nladder length = 12 feet\n\nSo, the ladder is 12 feet long."
