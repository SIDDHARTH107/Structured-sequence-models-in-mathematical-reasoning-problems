    "message_1": "Suppose a principal wants to hire an agent to work for them on a project. The agent can choose to work hard or slack off, and their effort level will determine the project's success. If the project is successful, the principal earns a profit of $50, while the agent earns a bonus of $20. If the project fails, both the principal and the agent receive nothing. The agent prefers slacking off to working hard because the effort required to work hard is costly. The principal is willing to offer the agent a bonus of $10 to motivate them to work hard. Given this information, what bonus should the principal offer the agent under a standard principal-agent contract to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal bonus, we need to consider the agent's preferences and the principal's expected profit. Let's denote the probability of project success when the agent works hard as P(S|H) and the probability of project success when the agent slacks off as P(S|L). Let C be the cost of effort for the agent to work hard.\n\nThe agent will choose to work hard if the expected utility of working hard is greater than the expected utility of slacking off. The expected utility of working hard is P(S|H) * (B - C), where B is the bonus offered by the principal. The expected utility of slacking off is P(S|L) * B. Therefore, the agent will work hard if:\n\nP(S|H) * (B - C) > P(S|L) * B\n\nNow, we need to consider the principal's expected profit. The principal's expected profit when the agent works hard is P(S|H) * ($50 - B). The principal's expected profit when the agent slacks off is P(S|L) * $50. The principal wants to maximize their expected profit, so they should choose a bonus B such that:\n\nP(S|H) * ($50 - B) > P(S|L) * $50\n\nCombining the two inequalities, we get:\n\nP(S|H) * (B - C) > P(S|L) * B > P(S|H) * ($50 - B)\n\nTo find the optimal bonus B, we can solve for B in the middle inequality:\n\nB > P(S|H) * ($50 - B) / (P(S|H) - P(S|L))\n\nSince the principal wants to minimize the bonus while still incentivizing the agent to work hard, we can set the inequality as an equality:\n\nB = P(S|H) * ($50 - B) / (P(S|H) - P(S|L))\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB * (P(S|H) - P(S|L)) = P(S|H) * ($50 - B)\n\nB * P(S|H) - B * P(S|L) = P(S|H) * $50 - P(S|H) * B\n\nB * (P(S|H) + P(S|L)) = P(S|H) * $50\n\nB = P(S|H) * $50 / (P(S|H) + P(S|L))\n\nThis is the optimal bonus the principal should offer the agent under a standard principal-agent contract to maximize their expected profit. Note that the actual value of B depends on the probabilities P(S|H) and P(S|L), which are not provided in the problem statement."
