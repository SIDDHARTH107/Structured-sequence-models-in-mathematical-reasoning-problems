    "message_2": "To find the probability of no hurricane occurring in the next 5 years, we need to find the probability of no hurricane occurring in each year and then multiply those probabilities together.\n\nThe probability of no hurricane occurring in a given year is 1 - the probability of a hurricane occurring, which is 1 - 0.08 = 0.92.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the probability of no hurricane occurring in each of the 5 years:\n\n0.92 * 0.92 * 0.92 * 0.92 * 0.92 = 0.92^5 â‰ˆ 0.6593\n\nSo, the probability of no hurricane occurring in the next 5 years in this region is approximately 0.6593, or 65.93%."
