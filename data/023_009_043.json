    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x. Since the function is odd, we only need to find the sine coefficients.\n\nThe sine coefficients are given by:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[x * sin(nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n^2) * cos(nx)] from -π to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n^2) * (cos(nπ) - cos(-nπ))]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and cos(-nπ) = (-1)^n, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n^2) * 2*(-1)^n]\n\nb_n = (-4/πn^2) * (-1)^n\n\nNow, let's write the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x:\n\nx = ∑[(-4/πn^2) * (-1)^n * sin(nx)]\n\nNow, we need to solve the boundary value problem:\n\ny'' + y = x,    -π ≤ x ≤ π,\ny(-π) = y(π),\ny'(-π) = y'(π)\n\nLet's assume the solution y(x) can be represented as a Fourier series:\n\ny(x) = a_0/2 + ∑[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives, we get:\n\ny'(x) = ∑[-n * a_n * sin(nx) + n * b_n * cos(nx)]\ny''(x) = ∑[-n^2 * a_n * cos(nx) - n^2 * b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nNow, substituting y''(x) + y(x) = x:\n\na_0/2 + ∑[(-n^2 * a_n + a_n) * cos(nx) + (-n^2 * b_n + b_n) * sin(nx)] = x\n\nComparing the coefficients of the Fourier series, we get:\n\na_0 = 0 (since there is no constant term in x)\na_n = 0 (since there are no cosine terms in x)\n-n^2 * b_n + b_n = (-4/πn^2) * (-1)^n (from the Fourier series of x)\n\nSolving for b_n:\n\nb_n = (-4/πn^2) * (-1)^n / (1 - n^2)\n\nNow, we can write the solution y(x) as:\n\ny(x) = ∑[(-4/πn^2) * (-1)^n * sin(nx) / (1 - n^2)]\n\nThis is the solution to the boundary value problem that satisfies the given conditions."
