    "message_1": "Consider the trefoil knot, represented as a closed loop in 3-dimensional space by passing one end of a rope through a loop and tying the ends together. What is the minimum number of times the rope must be passed through itself before tying the ends together in order to create a different knot?",
    "message_2": "To create a different knot from the trefoil knot, the rope must be passed through itself at least twice before tying the ends together. This will result in a knot known as the \"figure-eight knot,\" which is the simplest knot after the trefoil knot. The figure-eight knot has four crossings, while the trefoil knot has three crossings."
