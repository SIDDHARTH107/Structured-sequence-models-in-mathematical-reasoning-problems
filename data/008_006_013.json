    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[4 - λ, 2], [1, 3 - λ]]\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (4 - λ)(3 - λ) - (2)(1) = λ^2 - 7λ + 10\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 10 = 0\n\nBy factoring, we get:\n\n(λ - 2)(λ - 5) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 5.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n\n(A - 2I)v1 = 0\n[[2, 2], [1, 1]]v1 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we get the equation:\n\n2v1_1 + 2v1_2 = 0\nv1_1 = -v1_2\n\nLet v1_2 = 1, then v1_1 = -1. So, the eigenvector v1 = [-1, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 5:\n\n(A - 5I)v2 = 0\n[[-1, 2], [1, -2]]v2 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we get the equation:\n\n-v2_1 + 2v2_2 = 0\nv2_1 = 2v2_2\n\nLet v2_2 = 1, then v2_1 = 2. So, the eigenvector v2 = [2, 1].\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 5, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [-1, 1] and v2 = [2, 1]."
