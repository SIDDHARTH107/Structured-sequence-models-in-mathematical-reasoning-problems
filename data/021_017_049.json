    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the differential evolution algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of 20 random solutions (x-values) within the interval [0, 5].\n\n2. Evaluation: Calculate the fitness (f(x)) of each solution in the population.\n\n3. Iterate for 100 iterations:\n\n   a. For each solution in the population:\n   \n      i. Select three distinct solutions (a, b, and c) randomly from the population, excluding the current solution.\n      \n      ii. Generate a mutant solution (d) using the scaling factor (F = 0.8) as follows:\n          d = a + F * (b - c)\n          \n      iii. Perform crossover between the current solution (x) and the mutant solution (d) using the crossover probability (CR = 0.7) to create a trial solution (u). For each element in the solutions, if a random number between 0 and 1 is less than CR, take the element from d, otherwise take it from x.\n      \n      iv. Evaluate the fitness of the trial solution (u).\n      \n      v. If the fitness of the trial solution is better than the fitness of the current solution, replace the current solution with the trial solution.\n      \n4. After 100 iterations, find the solution with the best fitness in the population. This is the approximate minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 within the interval [0, 5].\n\nNote that the differential evolution algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, so the results may vary slightly between runs. However, after 100 iterations, the algorithm should converge to a solution close to the true minimum value of the function."
