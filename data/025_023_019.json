Suppose that H^i(X, IC(Y)) = 0 for i < k-d. Prove that H^i(Y, Q) = 0 for i < n-d. \n\nCompute H^2(Y, Q) for X = P^3 and Y = the projective curve defined by x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0.",
    "message_2": "To prove that H^i(Y, Q) = 0 for i < n-d, we will use the Gysin sequence associated with the inclusion map j: Y → X. The Gysin sequence is a long exact sequence that relates the cohomology of Y and X. It is given by:\n\n... → H^{i-2}(Y, Q) → H^i(X, Q) → H^i(X, IC(Y)) → H^{i-1}(Y, Q) → ...\n\nNow, we are given that H^i(X, IC(Y)) = 0 for i < k-d. Therefore, the Gysin sequence becomes:\n\n... → H^{i-2}(Y, Q) → H^i(X, Q) → 0 → H^{i-1}(Y, Q) → ...\n\nThis implies that the map H^{i-2}(Y, Q) → H^i(X, Q) is surjective and the map H^{i-1}(Y, Q) → H^i(X, Q) is injective for i < k-d.\n\nSince X is a smooth projective variety of dimension n, we have H^i(X, Q) = 0 for i > n. Therefore, for i < n-d, we have H^{i-2}(Y, Q) = 0 and H^{i-1}(Y, Q) = 0. This proves that H^i(Y, Q) = 0 for i < n-d.\n\nNow, let's compute H^2(Y, Q) for X = P^3 and Y = the projective curve defined by x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 3 and d = 1. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for i < n-d = 2, we have H^i(Y, Q) = H^i(X, Q). Since X = P^3, we have H^0(X, Q) = Q and H^2(X, Q) = Q. Therefore, H^2(Y, Q) = H^2(X, Q) = Q."
