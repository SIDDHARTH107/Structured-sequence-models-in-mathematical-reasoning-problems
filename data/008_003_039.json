    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to bring the matrix to its row-echelon form. The rank of the matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row-echelon form.\n\nGiven matrix:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -3 & -6 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nStep 2: Subtract 7 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & -6 & -12 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -3:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -6 & -12 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nStep 4: Add 6 times the second row to the third row:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that there are two non-zero rows, so the rank of the matrix is 2."
