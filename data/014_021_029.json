    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a Hill cipher message that was encrypted using a 3 x 3 key matrix [10, 2, 3; 3, 7, 8; 1, 1, 2]. You also know that the plaintext message consists of three consecutive letters and each letter is represented by a number using A = 0, B = 1, and so on. If the ciphertext letters are represented by numbers using A = 0, B = 1, and so on, find the plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Hill cipher message, we first need to find the inverse of the key matrix. The given key matrix is:\n\nK = | 10  2  3 |\n      |  3  7  8 |\n      |  1  1  2 |\n\nFirst, we need to find the determinant of K:\n\ndet(K) = 10(14 - 8) - 2(6 - 8) + 3(3 - 7)\n            = 10(6) + 2(2) - 3(4)\n            = 60 + 4 - 12\n            = 52\n\nNow, we need to find the adjugate of K:\n\nadj(K) = | (14 - 8)  -(6 - 8)   (3 - 7)  | = |  6  2 -4 |\n               | -(3 - 8)   (10 - 3) -(1 - 2) | = |  5  7 -1 |\n               |  (1 - 2)  -(1 - 3)   (10 - 6) | = | -1  2  4 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of K:\n\nK^(-1) = (1/det(K)) * adj(K)\n           = (1/52) * |  6  2 -4 |\n                          |  5  7 -1 |\n                          | -1  2  4 |\n\nNow, let's assume the ciphertext message is represented by the matrix C and the plaintext message by the matrix P. We know that C = K * P, so to find P, we need to multiply C by the inverse of K:\n\nP = K^(-1) * C\n\nSince we know that the plaintext message consists of three consecutive letters, let's represent them as x, x+1, and x+2. So, the plaintext matrix P would be:\n\nP = | x   |\n      | x+1 |\n      | x+2 |\n\nNow, we need to find the ciphertext matrix C. Since we don't have the actual ciphertext, we can't find the exact plaintext message. However, we can express the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext using the key matrix inverse and the consecutive letters assumption:\n\nP = K^(-1) * C\n| x   |   (1/52) * |  6  2 -4 | * | C1 |\n| x+1 | =               |  5  7 -1 | * | C2 |\n| x+2 |                 | -1  2  4 |   | C3 |\n\nThis equation represents the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext using the given key matrix. To find the exact plaintext message, we would need the ciphertext message."
