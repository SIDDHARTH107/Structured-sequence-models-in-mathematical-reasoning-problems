The company can sell the product at varying prices. The demand for the product can be modeled using the following equation: \n\n`p = 100 - 2q`, \n\nwhere `p` is the selling price of the product, and `q` is the quantity sold. \n\nWhat is the optimal selling price and quantity that maximizes the company's profit? How much profit does the company make? What is the elasticity of demand at the optimal price point?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal selling price and quantity that maximizes the company's profit, we first need to find the revenue function, R(q), and the cost function, C(q). Then, we can find the profit function, P(q), by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function. Finally, we'll find the maximum profit by taking the derivative of the profit function and setting it equal to zero.\n\n1. Revenue function, R(q):\nR(q) = p * q\nSince p = 100 - 2q, we can substitute this into the revenue function:\nR(q) = (100 - 2q) * q = 100q - 2q^2\n\n2. Cost function, C(q):\nThe cost per unit is $10, so the total cost is:\nC(q) = 10q\n\n3. Profit function, P(q):\nP(q) = R(q) - C(q) = (100q - 2q^2) - 10q = -2q^2 + 90q\n\n4. Find the maximum profit:\nTo find the maximum profit, we'll take the derivative of the profit function with respect to q and set it equal to zero:\ndP(q)/dq = -4q + 90 = 0\nSolving for q:\nq = 22.5\n\nSince we cannot sell a fraction of a product, we'll consider the nearest integer values, q = 22 and q = 23.\n\n5. Calculate the profit for q = 22 and q = 23:\nP(22) = -2(22)^2 + 90(22) = $858\nP(23) = -2(23)^2 + 90(23) = $851\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when q = 22. Now, we can find the optimal selling price:\np = 100 - 2(22) = 100 - 44 = $56\n\n6. Elasticity of demand at the optimal price point:\nThe elasticity of demand (E) is given by the formula:\nE = (dq/dp) * (p/q)\n\nFirst, we'll find dq/dp:\nSince p = 100 - 2q, we can rewrite this as:\nq = (100 - p) / 2\n\nNow, we'll take the derivative of q with respect to p:\ndq/dp = -1/2\n\nNow, we can find the elasticity of demand at the optimal price point (p = 56, q = 22):\nE = (-1/2) * (56/22) = -28/22 = -14/11 â‰ˆ -1.27\n\nSo, the optimal selling price is $56, the optimal quantity is 22 units, the maximum profit is $858, and the elasticity of demand at the optimal price point is approximately -1.27."
