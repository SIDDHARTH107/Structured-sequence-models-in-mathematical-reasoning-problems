    "message_1": "If the probability of studying mathematics leading to a high-paying job is 0.8, and the probability of not studying mathematics and still getting a high-paying job is 0.2, what is the causal effect of studying mathematics on the probability of getting a high-paying job?",
    "message_2": "The causal effect of studying mathematics on the probability of getting a high-paying job can be calculated by finding the difference between the probability of getting a high-paying job when studying mathematics and the probability of getting a high-paying job when not studying mathematics.\n\nCausal effect = P(high-paying job | studying mathematics) - P(high-paying job | not studying mathematics)\n\nCausal effect = 0.8 - 0.2\n\nCausal effect = 0.6\n\nSo, the causal effect of studying mathematics on the probability of getting a high-paying job is 0.6 or 60%."
