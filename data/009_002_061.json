    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the context of modeling the spread of infectious diseases using differential equations: \n\nSuppose a city has a population of 1 million people, and there is an outbreak of a new virus. The rate of infection is currently doubling every 2 days, and the initial number of infected people is 10. Use a differential equation to model the spread of the virus over a period of 20 days, and determine how many people are infected at the end of this period.",
    "message_2": "To model the spread of the virus, we can use the exponential growth model, which is a differential equation of the form:\n\ndI/dt = k * I\n\nwhere I(t) is the number of infected people at time t, and k is the growth rate constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of k. We know that the number of infected people doubles every 2 days, so:\n\nI(t) = I(0) * 2^(t/2)\n\nwhere I(0) is the initial number of infected people (10). We can rewrite this equation as:\n\nI(t) = 10 * 2^(t/2)\n\nNow, we can find the value of k by taking the derivative of I(t) with respect to t:\n\ndI/dt = (10 * ln(2)/2) * 2^(t/2)\n\nComparing this to the differential equation dI/dt = k * I, we can see that:\n\nk = ln(2)/2\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can use the exponential growth model to find the number of infected people at the end of the 20-day period:\n\nI(20) = 10 * 2^(20/2)\nI(20) = 10 * 2^10\nI(20) = 10 * 1024\nI(20) = 10,240\n\nAt the end of the 20-day period, there will be approximately 10,240 people infected with the virus in the city."
