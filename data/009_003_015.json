    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to heat transfer and diffusion equations in mathematics:\n\nA metal rod of length 10 cm and radius 0.5 cm initially has a temperature of 100°C. The temperature at the boundaries of the rod is kept constant at 0°C. If the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 cm²/s, find the temperature distribution in the rod after 10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature distribution in the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity, t is time, and x is the position along the rod.\n\nSince the temperature at the boundaries is kept constant at 0°C, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, t) = 0\nu(10, t) = 0\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nu(x, 0) = 100°C\n\nTo find the temperature distribution after 10 seconds, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) dT(t)/dt = α T(t) d²X(x)/dx²\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by αXT:\n\n(1/αT) dT(t)/dt = (1/X) d²X(x)/dx²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/αT) dT(t)/dt = -λ\n(1/X) d²X(x)/dx² = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\nd²X(x)/dx² + λX(x) = 0\ndT(t)/dt + αλT(t) = 0\n\nThe first equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = X(10) = 0. The solutions are given by:\n\nX_n(x) = sin(nπx/10)\nλ_n = (nπ/10)²\n\nThe second equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The solutions are given by:\n\nT_n(t) = exp(-αλ_n t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum of these solutions:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ (B_n sin(nπx/10) exp(-αλ_n t))\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = 100:\n\n100 = Σ (B_n sin(nπx/10))\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and we can find the coefficients B_n using the following formula:\n\nB_n = (2/L) ∫[0, L] (u(x, 0) sin(nπx/L) dx)\n\nIn our case, L = 10, so:\n\nB_n = (1/5) ∫[0, 10] (100 sin(nπx/10) dx)\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nB_n = (200/πn) (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution after 10 seconds as:\n\nu(x, 10) = Σ (B_n sin(nπx/10) exp(-αλ_n 10))\n\nSubstituting the values for B_n, α, and λ_n:\n\nu(x, 10) = Σ ((200/πn) (1 - (-1)^n) sin(nπx/10) exp(-(nπ/10)² * 0.1 * 10))\n\nThis series converges quickly, so we can approximate the temperature distribution by taking the first few terms of the series. For example, taking the first 5 terms:\n\nu(x, 10) ≈ (200/π) Σ ((1 - (-1)^n)/n) sin(nπx/10) exp(-(nπ/10)²)\n\nThis gives us the temperature distribution in the rod after 10 seconds."
