    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Here, we will use PSO to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 within the interval [-4, 4].\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n- Number of particles: N = 10 (for example)\n- Number of iterations: T = 100 (for example)\n- Inertia weight: w = 0.7 (for example)\n- Acceleration constants: c1 = c2 = 2 (for example)\n- Lower and upper bounds: lb = -4, ub = 4\n\n2. Initialize the particles' positions and velocities randomly within the bounds.\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each particle (i.e., calculate the function value f(x) for each particle's position).\n\n4. Set the personal best position (pbest) of each particle to its initial position and the global best position (gbest) to the position of the particle with the highest fitness.\n\n5. Iterate for T iterations:\n   a. For each particle, update its velocity and position using the following equations:\n      - v(t+1) = w * v(t) + c1 * rand() * (pbest - x(t)) + c2 * rand() * (gbest - x(t))\n      - x(t+1) = x(t) + v(t+1)\n      (where rand() is a random number between 0 and 1)\n\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of each particle.\n\n   c. Update the pbest and gbest positions if a better position is found.\n\n6. The maximum value of the function is the fitness of the gbest position.\n\nNote that the PSO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the results may vary depending on the initial conditions and parameter settings. You may need to run the algorithm multiple times or fine-tune the parameters to obtain a more accurate result."
