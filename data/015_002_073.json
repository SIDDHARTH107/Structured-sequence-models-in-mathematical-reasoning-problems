    "message_2": "To find the expected difference in the system after 10 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nDifference = Initial difference * e^(Lyapunov exponent * number of iterations)\n\nIn this case, the initial difference is 0.001, the Lyapunov exponent is 0.25, and the number of iterations is 10.\n\nDifference = 0.001 * e^(0.25 * 10)\n\nDifference = 0.001 * e^2.5\n\nDifference ≈ 0.001 * 12.182\n\nDifference ≈ 0.012182\n\nSo, the expected difference in the system after 10 iterations is approximately 0.012182."
