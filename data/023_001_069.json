Then, du = dx and v = (-1 / n) * cos(n * x).\n\nApplying integration by parts, we get:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-x / n) * cos(n * x) | from -π to π - ∫[-π, π] (-1 / n) * cos(n * x) dx]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-π / n) * cos(n * π) - (-π / n) * cos(-n * π) + (1 / n) * ∫[-π, π] cos(n * x) dx]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n and cos(-n * π) = (-1)^n, the first two terms cancel each other out. Also, the integral of cos(n * x) is an even function, so its value is 0:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * (1 / n) * [sin(n * x)] | from -π to π = (1 / n) * [sin(n * π) - sin(-n * π)] = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x in the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(n * x)] = Σ [(2 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
