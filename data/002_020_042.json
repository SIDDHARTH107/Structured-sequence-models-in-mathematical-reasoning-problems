    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (angle/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere angle is the angle of the sector (in degrees) and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60/360) × 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/6) × 16π\nArc length = 16π/6\nArc length = 8π/3 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = (8π/3) + 2(8)\nPerimeter = (8π/3) + 16\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is (8π/3) + 16 cm."
