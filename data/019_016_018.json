    "message_2": "Let A be the set of students who love calculus, and B be the set of students who love algebra. We are given that |A| = 20, |B| = 30, and there are 10 students who don't love either calculus or algebra.\n\nWe want to find the number of students who love both calculus and algebra, which is the intersection of sets A and B, denoted as |A ∩ B|.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who love either calculus or algebra:\n\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|\n\nWe also know that there are 50 students in total, and 10 of them don't love either calculus or algebra, so there must be 40 students who love either calculus or algebra:\n\n|A ∪ B| = 40\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we know:\n\n40 = 20 + 30 - |A ∩ B|\n\nSolving for |A ∩ B|:\n\n|A ∩ B| = 20 + 30 - 40\n|A ∩ B| = 50 - 40\n|A ∩ B| = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 students who love both calculus and algebra."
