    "message_1": "Suppose you have $50,000 to invest in a portfolio consisting of two assets: Asset A and Asset B. Asset A has an expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 8%, while Asset B has an expected return of 8% and a standard deviation of 6%. The correlation coefficient between Asset A and Asset B is 0.4. What is the optimal allocation of your portfolio between Asset A and Asset B if you want to minimize the portfolio standard deviation while obtaining an expected return of at least 9%?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation between Asset A and Asset B, we need to calculate the portfolio weights that minimize the portfolio standard deviation while achieving an expected return of at least 9%.\n\nLet wA be the weight of Asset A and wB be the weight of Asset B in the portfolio. Since there are only two assets, wA + wB = 1.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as follows:\n\nRp = wA * Expected Return of Asset A + wB * Expected Return of Asset B\n\nWe want Rp to be at least 9%, so:\n\n0.09 ≤ wA * 0.10 + wB * 0.08\n\nThe portfolio standard deviation (σp) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσp = √(wA^2 * σA^2 + wB^2 * σB^2 + 2 * wA * wB * σA * σB * ρ)\n\nwhere σA and σB are the standard deviations of Asset A and Asset B, respectively, and ρ is the correlation coefficient between the two assets.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nσp = √(wA^2 * 0.08^2 + wB^2 * 0.06^2 + 2 * wA * wB * 0.08 * 0.06 * 0.4)\n\nTo minimize the portfolio standard deviation while achieving an expected return of at least 9%, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let L be the Lagrangian function:\n\nL = wA^2 * 0.08^2 + wB^2 * 0.06^2 + 2 * wA * wB * 0.08 * 0.06 * 0.4 - λ(0.10 * wA + 0.08 * wB - 0.09)\n\nTaking the partial derivatives of L with respect to wA and wB and setting them to zero, we get:\n\n∂L/∂wA = 2 * 0.08^2 * wA + 2 * 0.08 * 0.06 * 0.4 * wB - λ * 0.10 = 0\n∂L/∂wB = 2 * 0.06^2 * wB + 2 * 0.08 * 0.06 * 0.4 * wA - λ * 0.08 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n\nwA = 0.6\nwB = 0.4\n\nSo, the optimal allocation to minimize the portfolio standard deviation while obtaining an expected return of at least 9% is 60% in Asset A and 40% in Asset B. In terms of the initial investment of $50,000, this means investing $30,000 in Asset A and $20,000 in Asset B."
