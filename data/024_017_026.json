    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the initial vector along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector to the curve at each point. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the position vector $r(t)$ with respect to $t$. So, let's find $r'(t)$:\n\n$r'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\langle t, t^2, 2t \\rangle = \\langle 1, 2t, 2 \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the initial vector $\\langle 1, 0, 0 \\rangle$ along the curve. The parallel transport of a vector along a curve is a vector that remains parallel to the initial vector while moving along the curve. To find this vector, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} \\cdot T(t)$,\n\nwhere $V(t)$ is the parallel transport of the initial vector, and $T(t)$ is the unit tangent vector of the curve. The unit tangent vector is given by:\n\n$T(t) = \\frac{r'(t)}{\\|r'(t)\\|} = \\frac{\\langle 1, 2t, 2 \\rangle}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (2t)^2 + 2^2}} = \\frac{\\langle 1, 2t, 2 \\rangle}{\\sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4}}$.\n\nNow, let's find the parallel transport vector $V(t)$ by solving the equation:\n\n$\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} \\cdot T(t)$.\n\nSince $V(t)$ is parallel to the initial vector $\\langle 1, 0, 0 \\rangle$, we can write $V(t) = \\langle v(t), 0, 0 \\rangle$. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle v(t), 0, 0 \\rangle = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle v(t), 0, 0 \\rangle \\cdot \\frac{\\langle 1, 2t, 2 \\rangle}{\\sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4}}$.\n\nNow, we only need to solve for $v(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{dv(t)}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4}}$.\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$v(t) = \\int -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4}} dt$.\n\nLet $u = 1 + 4t^2 + 4$, then $du = 8t dt$. So, the integral becomes:\n\n$v(t) = -\\frac{1}{8} \\int \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u}} = -\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{u} + C = -\\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4} + C$.\n\nSince $v(0) = 1$, we can find the constant $C$:\n\n$1 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{1 + 4(0)^2 + 4} + C \\Rightarrow C = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThus, the parallel transport vector is:\n\n$V(t) = \\langle -\\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4} + \\frac{3}{4}, 0, 0 \\rangle$.\n\nFinally, we can find the parallel transport of the initial vector at $t = \\sqrt{2}$:\n\n$V(\\sqrt{2}) = \\langle -\\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{1 + 4(\\sqrt{2})^2 + 4} + \\frac{3}{4}, 0, 0 \\rangle = \\langle -\\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{9} + \\frac{3}{4}, 0, 0 \\rangle = \\langle 0, 0, 0 \\rangle$."
