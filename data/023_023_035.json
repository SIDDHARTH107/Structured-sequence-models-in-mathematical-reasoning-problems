    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Using the Fourier transform to analyze the behavior of networks:\n\nSuppose we have a network with an input signal of V(t) = 5 * sin(2πt) volts and the output signal of the network is I(t) = 4 * sin(2πt + 0.25π) amperes. \nCalculate the transfer function H(ω) of the network and subsequently determine the amplitude and phase shift of the output signal with respect to the input signal.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the transfer function H(ω) of the network, we first need to find the Fourier transforms of the input and output signals. The Fourier transform of a sinusoidal function is given by:\n\nF{sin(ωt + φ)} = (1/2j) * (e^(j(ωt + φ)) - e^(-j(ωt + φ)))\n\nFor the input signal V(t) = 5 * sin(2πt), we have ω = 2π and φ = 0. Therefore, the Fourier transform of V(t) is:\n\nF{V(t)} = (5/2j) * (e^(j(2πt)) - e^(-j(2πt)))\n\nFor the output signal I(t) = 4 * sin(2πt + 0.25π), we have ω = 2π and φ = 0.25π. Therefore, the Fourier transform of I(t) is:\n\nF{I(t)} = (4/2j) * (e^(j(2πt + 0.25π)) - e^(-j(2πt + 0.25π)))\n\nNow, the transfer function H(ω) is given by the ratio of the Fourier transform of the output signal to the Fourier transform of the input signal:\n\nH(ω) = F{I(t)} / F{V(t)}\n\nH(ω) = [(4/2j) * (e^(j(2πt + 0.25π)) - e^(-j(2πt + 0.25π)))] / [(5/2j) * (e^(j(2πt)) - e^(-j(2πt)))]\n\nH(ω) = (4/5) * (e^(j0.25π) - e^(-j0.25π)) / (e^(j0) - e^(-j0))\n\nH(ω) = (4/5) * (e^(j0.25π) - e^(-j0.25π))\n\nThe amplitude of the transfer function is given by the magnitude of H(ω):\n\n|H(ω)| = 4/5\n\nThe phase shift of the transfer function is given by the angle of H(ω):\n\n∠H(ω) = 0.25π\n\nSo, the transfer function H(ω) has an amplitude of 4/5 and a phase shift of 0.25π. This means that the output signal has an amplitude that is 4/5 times the amplitude of the input signal, and it is phase-shifted by 0.25π radians (45 degrees) with respect to the input signal."
