    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cone-shaped water tank using integration, we first need to set up the integral. We will integrate the cross-sectional area of the tank with respect to its height.\n\nThe equation for the cross-sectional area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius of the cone changes as we move up along the height, we need to find an expression for the radius in terms of the height.\n\nWe can use similar triangles to find the relationship between the radius and the height. Let r(h) be the radius at a height h from the bottom of the cone. Then, we have the following proportion:\n\nr(h) / h = 4 / 6\n\nSolving for r(h), we get:\n\nr(h) = (2/3)h\n\nNow, we can write the cross-sectional area A(h) in terms of h:\n\nA(h) = π[r(h)]^2 = π[(2/3)h]^2 = (4/9)πh^2\n\nTo find the volume of the cone, we integrate A(h) with respect to h from 0 to 6:\n\nV = ∫[A(h) dh] from 0 to 6 = ∫[(4/9)πh^2 dh] from 0 to 6\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\nV = (4/9)π ∫[h^2 dh] from 0 to 6\n\nUsing the power rule for integration, we get:\n\nV = (4/9)π [(1/3)h^3] from 0 to 6\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\nV = (4/9)π [(1/3)(6^3) - (1/3)(0^3)]\n\nV = (4/9)π (1/3)(216)\n\nV = (4/9)π (72)\n\nV = 32π\n\nNow, we round the answer to the nearest cubic meter:\n\nV ≈ 32 * 3.1416 ≈ 100.53\n\nSo, the volume of the water tank when filled to the top is approximately 101 cubic meters."
