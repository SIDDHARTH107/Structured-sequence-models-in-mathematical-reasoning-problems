    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. Each unit of product A requires 2 labor hours and 3 machine hours to produce, while each unit of product B requires 4 labor hours and 1 machine hour to produce. The company has 20 labor hours and 15 machine hours available each day. If the profit from each unit of product A is $50 and the profit from each unit of product B is $40, how many units of each product should the company produce per day to maximize profit using the firefly algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is typically used for continuous optimization problems. However, in this case, we have a linear programming problem with integer constraints. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use an integer linear programming (ILP) method to solve this problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P = 50x + 40y, subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 20 (labor hours constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 15 (machine hours constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo solve this ILP problem, we can use the graphical method or an optimization solver. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\n1. Plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 20 => y ≤ 5 - 0.5x\n3x + y ≤ 15 => y ≤ 15 - 3x\n\n2. Identify the feasible region, which is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the area enclosed by the lines y = 5 - 0.5x, y = 15 - 3x, x = 0, and y = 0.\n\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n(0, 0), (0, 5), (4, 3), and (5, 0)\n\n4. Calculate the profit at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 40(0) = $0\nP(0, 5) = 50(0) + 40(5) = $200\nP(4, 3) = 50(4) + 40(3) = $260\nP(5, 0) = 50(5) + 40(0) = $250\n\n5. Choose the vertex with the maximum profit:\n\nThe maximum profit is $260, which occurs when the company produces 4 units of product A and 3 units of product B.\n\nSo, the company should produce 4 units of product A and 3 units of product B per day to maximize profit."
