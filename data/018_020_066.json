The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nThe union of A and B (A ∪ B) is the set of all elements in either A or B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}\n\nThe intersection of A and B (A ∩ B) is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference (A Δ B):\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8} - {2, 4} = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nNext, we need to find the union of the symmetric difference (A Δ B) and the set {5}:\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ {5} = {1, 3, 6, 8} ∪ {5} = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nSo, (A Δ B) ∪ {5} = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}."
