    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2} = {1, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's compute the Cartesian products (A △ B) × A and B × (B △ A).\n\n(A △ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nB × (B △ A) = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two Cartesian products:\n\n(A △ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nB × (B △ A) = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) × A ≠ B × (B △ A). This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product."
