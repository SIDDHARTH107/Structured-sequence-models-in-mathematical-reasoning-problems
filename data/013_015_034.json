    "message_1": "Suppose a principal wants to incentivize an agent to work harder while minimizing the cost of incentives. The agent's effort level affects the probability of a successful outcome, which would yield a payoff of $10 for the principal. The agent incurs a cost of $2 for each unit of effort. If the agent's effort level is observable, what is the optimal incentive scheme for the principal to implement?",
    "message_2": "Let e be the effort level of the agent, and let p(e) be the probability of a successful outcome as a function of e. The principal's payoff is 10p(e) - I(e), where I(e) is the incentive payment to the agent. The agent's payoff is I(e) - 2e. The principal wants to maximize their payoff while ensuring that the agent has a positive payoff.\n\nSince the agent's effort level is observable, the principal can design an incentive scheme that is contingent on the agent's effort. The principal should choose an incentive payment I(e) such that the agent's payoff is maximized at the desired effort level e*.\n\nTo find the optimal effort level e*, we need to consider the agent's participation constraint and the principal's objective of minimizing the cost of incentives. The agent's participation constraint is:\n\nI(e) - 2e >= 0\n\nThe principal's objective is to maximize their payoff:\n\n10p(e) - I(e)\n\nTaking the first-order condition with respect to e, we get:\n\n10p'(e) - I'(e) = 0\n\nSince the agent's payoff is maximized at e*, we have:\n\nI'(e*) = 2\n\nSubstituting this into the first-order condition, we get:\n\n10p'(e*) = 2\n\nSolving for e*:\n\ne* = p'^(-1)(1/5)\n\nNow, we can find the optimal incentive scheme I(e) by integrating the marginal incentive payment:\n\nI(e) = âˆ«2de = 2e + C\n\nTo satisfy the agent's participation constraint, we set C = 0:\n\nI(e) = 2e\n\nThus, the optimal incentive scheme for the principal to implement is to pay the agent an incentive payment of 2e for each unit of effort."
