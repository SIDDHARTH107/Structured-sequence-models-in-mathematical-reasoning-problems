    "message_2": "To parallel transport the vector v along the curve y = x^2 from point P to point Q, we need to keep the vector tangent to the curve at each point along the curve. \n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector at point P. The derivative of y = x^2 is y' = 2x. At point P (1, 2), the tangent vector is T_P = (1, y'(1)) = (1, 2).\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vector at point Q. At point Q (3, 9), the tangent vector is T_Q = (1, y'(3)) = (1, 6).\n\nNext, we need to find the transformation matrix that maps T_P to T_Q. Since the tangent vectors are 2D, we can use a 2x2 matrix A:\n\nA * T_P = T_Q\n\nLet A = |a  b|\n        |c  d|\n\nThen, we have the following system of equations:\n\na + 2c = 1\nb + 2d = 6\n\nWe can solve this system to find the matrix A:\n\na = 1 - 2c\nb = 6 - 2d\n\nNow, let's choose c and d such that the determinant of A is 1 (to preserve the orientation and scale of the vector):\n\ndet(A) = ad - bc = 1\n\n(1 - 2c)d - bc = 1\n\nWe can choose c = 1 and d = 2, which satisfy the equation:\n\n(1 - 2*1)(2) - (1)(2) = 1\n\nSo, the transformation matrix A is:\n\nA = | -1  2|\n      |  1  2|\n\nNow, we can apply this transformation to the vector v:\n\nA * v = | -1  2| * |2| = |-6|\n             |  1  2|   |4|    |10|\n\nSo, after parallel transport along the curve to the point Q = (3, 9), the components of the vector v are (-6, 10)."
