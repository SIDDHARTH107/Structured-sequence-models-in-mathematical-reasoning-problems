The last non-zero remainder will be the GCD.\n\nStep 1:\nDivide the larger number (312) by the smaller number (168) and find the remainder:\n\n312 รท 168 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 144.\n\nStep 2:\nNow, divide the previous divisor (168) by the remainder from the previous step (144):\n\n168 รท 144 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 24.\n\nStep 3:\nDivide the previous remainder (144) by the new remainder (24):\n\n144 รท 24 = 6 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we've reached a remainder of 0, the last non-zero remainder (24) is the GCD of 168 and 312. So, the GCD(168, 312) = 24."
