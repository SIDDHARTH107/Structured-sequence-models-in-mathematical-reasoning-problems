    "message_2": "In a hyperbolic plane, the area of a triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle is:\n\nArea = (π - (α + β + γ)) * (-1/K)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle, K is the curvature of the hyperbolic plane, and π is the constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nIn this case, the curvature K = -1.5, and the angles are α = 60°, β = 70°, and γ = 50°. First, we need to convert the angles from degrees to radians:\n\nα = 60° * (π/180) = π/3 radians\nβ = 70° * (π/180) = 7π/18 radians\nγ = 50° * (π/180) = 5π/18 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (π - (π/3 + 7π/18 + 5π/18)) * (-1/-1.5)\nArea = (π - (π/3 + 12π/18)) * (1/1.5)\nArea = (π - (6π/18)) * (1/1.5)\nArea = (12π/18 - 6π/18) * (1/1.5)\nArea = (6π/18) * (1/1.5)\nArea = (π/3) * (1/1.5)\nArea = π/4.5\n\nThe area of the hyperbolic triangle is π/4.5 square units."
