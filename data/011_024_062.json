There are two ways to transport the goods: by land or by air. If they choose the land route, it costs $8 per kg and takes 20 hours to transport. If they choose the air route, it costs $15 per kg and takes only 4 hours to transport. The company wants to transport 10,000 kgs of goods using both routes in such a way that the total cost is minimized and the time taken does not exceed 24 hours. How many kgs of goods should be transported by land and air to minimize the cost?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of goods (in kgs) transported by land and y be the amount of goods (in kgs) transported by air. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 10,000 (total goods to be transported)\n2. 20x + 4y <= 24 * 10,000 (total time constraint)\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost, which is given by the equation:\n\nCost = 8x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to solve the constraint equations for x and y. From the first constraint, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 10,000 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the second constraint:\n\n20x + 4(10,000 - x) <= 24 * 10,000\n20x + 40,000 - 4x <= 240,000\n16x <= 200,000\nx >= 12,500\n\nSince x must be a whole number, the minimum value for x is 12,500. Now, we can find the corresponding value for y:\n\ny = 10,000 - 12,500\ny = -2,500\n\nHowever, this solution is not feasible since y cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to adjust the time constraint to find a feasible solution. Let's increase the total time allowed to 25 hours:\n\n20x + 4y <= 25 * 10,000\n\nNow, substitute the expression for y in the adjusted time constraint:\n\n20x + 4(10,000 - x) <= 25 * 10,000\n20x + 40,000 - 4x <= 250,000\n16x <= 210,000\nx >= 13,125\n\nSince x must be a whole number, the minimum value for x is 13,125. Now, we can find the corresponding value for y:\n\ny = 10,000 - 13,125\ny = -3,125\n\nAgain, this solution is not feasible since y cannot be negative. We need to adjust the time constraint once more. Let's increase the total time allowed to 26 hours:\n\n20x + 4y <= 26 * 10,000\n\nNow, substitute the expression for y in the adjusted time constraint:\n\n20x + 4(10,000 - x) <= 26 * 10,000\n20x + 40,000 - 4x <= 260,000\n16x <= 220,000\nx >= 13,750\n\nSince x must be a whole number, the minimum value for x is 13,750. Now, we can find the corresponding value for y:\n\ny = 10,000 - 13,750\ny = -3,750\n\nThis solution is still not feasible since y cannot be negative. We can continue adjusting the time constraint and testing for feasible solutions, but it becomes clear that there is no feasible solution that meets the given constraints. The problem may need to be reevaluated or additional constraints may need to be considered."
