    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as an implicit function of x.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\nd/dx(xy) + d/dx(sin(y)) = d/dx(5)\n\nUsing the product rule on the first term, we have:\n\n(x * dy/dx + y * 1) + cos(y) * dy/dx = 0\n\nNow, we'll solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx * (x + cos(y)) = -y\n\ndy/dx = -y / (x + cos(y))\n\nNow, we'll plug in the point (1, π/2) into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = -(π/2) / (1 + cos(π/2))\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\ndy/dx = -(π/2) / 1\n\ndy/dx = -π/2\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at the point (1, π/2) is -π/2."
