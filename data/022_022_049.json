    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier transform of the function f(z) = e^(-z^2/2), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform for a function f(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nIn our case, f(t) = e^(-t^2/2). So, we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-t^2/2) * e^(-iωt)] dt, with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫[e^(-at^2)] dt = √(π/a), where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞ and a > 0.\n\nLet's rewrite the integral F(ω) as follows:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-t^2/2) * e^(-iωt)] dt = ∫[e^(-t^2/2 - iωt)] dt.\n\nNow, complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-t^2/2 - iωt = -(t^2 + 2iωt)/2 = -((t + iω)^2 - ω^2)/2.\n\nSo, F(ω) = ∫[e^{-((t + iω)^2 - ω^2)/2}] dt.\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: u = t + iω. Then, du = dt, and when t goes from -∞ to +∞, u also goes from -∞ to +∞. So, we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^{-(u^2 - ω^2)/2}] du, with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nNow, we can split the exponent:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^{-u^2/2} * e^{ω^2/2}] du.\n\nSince e^(ω^2/2) does not depend on u, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nF(ω) = e^(ω^2/2) * ∫[e^(-u^2/2)] du, with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nNow, we can use the Gaussian integral formula with a = 1/2:\n\nF(ω) = e^(ω^2/2) * √(π/(1/2)) = e^(ω^2/2) * √(2π).\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(z) = e^(-z^2/2) is F(ω) = e^(ω^2/2) * √(2π)."
