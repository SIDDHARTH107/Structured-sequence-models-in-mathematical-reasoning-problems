    "message_2": "The given potential function is defined as:\n\nV(x) = {4, 0 < x < 1; 0, x ≥ 1}\n\nThis means that the potential well is of width 1 (from x = 0 to x = 1) and has infinite potential walls at x = 0 and x = 1. The particle is in the ground state with energy E1. Since the potential is zero for x ≥ 1, the probability of finding the particle in the right half of the well (1 ≤ x ≤ 2) is zero. The particle is confined within the potential well (0 < x < 1) and cannot be found outside of it.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the particle in the right half of the well (1 ≤ x ≤ 2) is 0."
