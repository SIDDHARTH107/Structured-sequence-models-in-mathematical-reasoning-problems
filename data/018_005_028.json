    "message_2": "To find a set B such that the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set, we can simply choose B to be the complement of A. \n\nLet's denote the universal set as U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since A and A' have no elements in common, their intersection is the empty set.\n\nSo, B = A', and the intersection of A and B is the empty set."
