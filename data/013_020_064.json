    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest game where there are 10 players and each player must choose a number between 0 and 100, inclusive. The winner is the person who chooses a number closest to two-thirds of the average of all chosen numbers. If two or more players tie with the same closest number, the player who submitted their number first will be declared the winner. What number should each player choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. First, let's denote the average of all chosen numbers as A. Then, the target number to win the game is (2/3)A. Since all players are trying to maximize their chances of winning, they will also try to guess the number closest to (2/3)A.\n\nNow, let's consider the highest possible average, which occurs when all players choose 100. In this case, A = 100, and the target number is (2/3)(100) = 200/3 ≈ 66.67. However, this scenario is unlikely because all players know that choosing 100 will not get them closer to the target number.\n\nTherefore, players will adjust their guesses, lowering the average. Let's assume all players choose 66.67 as their number. In this case, A = 66.67, and the target number is (2/3)(66.67) ≈ 44.44. This process of adjusting guesses and lowering the average will continue until an equilibrium is reached.\n\nTo find the equilibrium, let's assume that all players choose the same number x, which is the best guess for the target number (2/3)A. Since all players choose x, the average A will also be x. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nx = (2/3)A\n\nSince A = x, we can substitute A with x:\n\nx = (2/3)x\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by (2/3):\n\nx / (2/3) = 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3/2:\n\n(3/2)x = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 2/3\n\nSo, the equilibrium number that each player should choose to maximize their chances of winning is 2/3, or approximately 0.67. However, since players must choose a whole number between 0 and 100, the best choice would be to choose 1, as it is the closest whole number to 0.67."
