    "message_2": "The minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph can be found using the concept of edge connectivity. Edge connectivity is defined as the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, we can observe that the vertex 'b' has the least number of edges connected to it, which are 2 edges (ab and bc). If we remove these 2 edges, the graph will be disconnected.\n\nSo, the edge connectivity of the given graph is 2, and the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 2."
