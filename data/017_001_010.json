    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on its order and elements.\n\nSince G has order 4, it has 4 elements, one of which must be the identity element, denoted by e. Let the other three elements be a, b, and c.\n\nNow, consider the possible orders of the elements a, b, and c. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Therefore, the possible orders of the elements are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nThe order of the identity element e is 1. If any of the other elements have order 4, then G would be a cyclic group generated by that element, and G would be isomorphic to C4. So, let's assume none of the elements have order 4.\n\nNow, we are left with the possibility that all non-identity elements have order 2. In this case, we have:\n\na * a = e\nb * b = e\nc * c = e\n\nSince G is a group, it must satisfy the closure property. This means that the product of any two elements in G must also be in G. We already know that a * a = e and b * b = e. Now, let's consider the product a * b. It cannot be equal to a or b, because that would imply that either a or b has order 1, which is not possible. Therefore, a * b must be equal to c.\n\nNow, we have the following relations:\n\na * a = e\nb * b = e\nc * c = e\na * b = c\n\nThese relations are exactly the same as those of the Klein four-group V4, which has elements {e, a, b, c} and the relations:\n\ne * e = e\na * a = e\nb * b = e\nc * c = e\na * b = c\nb * a = c\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 4, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4. If all non-identity elements of G have order 2, it is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
