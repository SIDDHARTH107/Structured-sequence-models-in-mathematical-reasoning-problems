    "message_2": "A Menger Sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube and the six cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a third level Menger Sponge, the process is applied three times. Let's calculate the number of smaller cubes at each level:\n\nLevel 0: 1 cube (the initial cube)\nLevel 1: 20 cubes (1 * 20, as 7 out of 27 smaller cubes are removed)\nLevel 2: 20 * 20 = 400 cubes (each of the 20 cubes from level 1 is replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\nLevel 3: 20 * 20 * 20 = 8,000 cubes (each of the 400 cubes from level 2 is replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\n\nSo, the total number of smaller cubes in a third level Menger Sponge is 8,000."
