    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a group of 200 people, 30 of whom are over the age of 60, at least 10 people over the age of 60 will be affected by the disease? The probability of someone in the general population being affected by the disease is 0.05 whereas the probability for someone over the age of 60 is 0.2.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people over 60 being affected by the disease), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.2 for people over 60), and n is the number of trials (30 people over 60).\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 10 people over 60 being affected by the disease, so we will find the probabilities for 10, 11, ..., 30 people being affected and sum them up.\n\nP(X >= 10) = P(X = 10) + P(X = 11) + ... + P(X = 30)\n\nWe can calculate each of these probabilities using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 10) = Σ [C(30, k) * (0.2)^k * (0.8)^(30-k)] for k = 10 to 30\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the summation, we get:\n\nP(X >= 10) ≈ 0.986\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 people over the age of 60 will be affected by the disease is approximately 0.986 or 98.6%."
