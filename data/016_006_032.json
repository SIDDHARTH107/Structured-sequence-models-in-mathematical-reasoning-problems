    "message_1": "What is the scale factor of the Barnsley fern if the original fern measures 5 cm and the largest sub-fern measures 1 cm?",
    "message_2": "The scale factor can be found by dividing the size of the largest sub-fern by the size of the original fern. In this case, the scale factor is:\n\n1 cm (size of the largest sub-fern) / 5 cm (size of the original fern) = 1/5 = 0.2\n\nSo, the scale factor of the Barnsley fern is 0.2."
