    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all permutations of its vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. In this case, we are looking for all the permutations of the vertices that keep the graph structure unchanged.\n\nFor the given graph, the automorphism group consists of the following permutations:\n\n1. Identity permutation (no change): (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)\n2. Swap vertices 1 and 3, and vertices 2 and 4: (13)(24)(5)\n3. Swap vertices 2 and 4: (1)(24)(3)(5)\n4. Swap vertices 1 and 3: (13)(2)(4)(5)\n\nThese are the only permutations that preserve the adjacency relation in the graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph is { (1)(2)(3)(4)(5), (13)(24)(5), (1)(24)(3)(5), (13)(2)(4)(5) }."
