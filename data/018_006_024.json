    "message_1": "Let A be a set of integers such that A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. Find the complement of A, and show that the union of A and its complement is the universal set of integers.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to identify all the integers that are not in A. Since A consists of specific even integers, the complement of A will include all odd integers and all other even integers not in A. Let's denote the complement of A as A'.\n\nA' = {..., -11, -9, -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...} ∪ {..., -12, -10, -6, -4, -2, 0, 12, 14, 16, ...}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and A' (denoted as A ∪ A'). The union of two sets is a set containing all elements from both sets, without duplication.\n\nA ∪ A' = {..., -11, -9, -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...} ∪ {..., -12, -10, -6, -4, -2, 0, 12, 14, 16, ...}\n\nCombining the sets, we get:\n\nA ∪ A' = {..., -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...}\n\nAs we can see, the union of A and A' includes all integers (positive, negative, and zero). Therefore, the union of A and its complement A' is the universal set of integers, denoted as ℤ.\n\nA ∪ A' = ℤ"
