    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral ∫𝐶 z^3 dz, we parameterize the unit circle using z(t) = e^(it), where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Then, we find the derivative of z(t) with respect to t:\n\ndz/dt = d(e^(it))/dt = i * e^(it)\n\nNow, we can substitute z(t) into the integrand and multiply by dz/dt:\n\nz^3 * dz/dt = (e^(it))^3 * (i * e^(it)) = i * e^(4it)\n\nNext, we change the integral from a contour integral to a standard integral with respect to t:\n\n∫𝐶 z^3 dz = ∫₀²π i * e^(4it) dt\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to t:\n\n∫₀²π i * e^(4it) dt = (1/4) * e^(4it) |₀²π\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n(1/4) * e^(4i(2π)) - (1/4) * e^(4i(0)) = (1/4) * (1 - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the integral ∫𝐶 z^3 dz = 0."
