    "message_1": "A company produces two products, X and Y. Each unit of X requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor, while each unit of Y requires 1 hour of machine time and 4 hours of labor. The company has 240 machine hours and 200 labor hours available. Product X nets a profit of $20 per unit and product Y nets a profit of $30 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of products X and Y to produce, given the constraints on machine hours and labor hours. Let's use x to represent the number of units of product X and y to represent the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe constraints can be represented as linear inequalities:\n\nMachine hours: 3x + y ≤ 240\nLabor hours: 2x + 4y ≤ 200\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nNow, we'll solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region, which represents all possible combinations of x and y that satisfy the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the constraints in slope-intercept form:\n\ny ≤ -3x + 240 (Machine hours constraint)\ny ≤ -0.5x + 50 (Labor hours constraint)\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the points of intersection between the constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of machine hours constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n0 = -3x + 240\nx = 80\n\nSo, the first vertex is (80, 0).\n\n2. Intersection of labor hours constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n0 = -0.5x + 50\nx = 100\n\nSo, the second vertex is (100, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of machine hours constraint and labor hours constraint:\n-3x + 240 = -0.5x + 50\n-2.5x = -190\nx = 76\n\nNow, substitute x back into one of the equations to find y:\n\ny = -0.5(76) + 50\ny = 38\n\nSo, the third vertex is (76, 38).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (80, 0): 20(80) + 30(0) = $1600\n2. Profit at (100, 0): 20(100) + 30(0) = $2000\n3. Profit at (76, 38): 20(76) + 30(38) = $1520 + $1140 = $2660\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (76, 38), where the company produces 76 units of product X and 38 units of product Y, resulting in a profit of $2660."
