    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components in a graph, we can use the formula:\n\nnumber of connected components = number of vertices - number of edges + number of cycles\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of cycles in the graph. Since the graph has 7 vertices and 10 edges, it must have at least one cycle. The maximum number of edges in a tree (a connected graph with no cycles) with 7 vertices is 6 (one less than the number of vertices). Since there are 10 edges, there must be at least 4 additional edges that form cycles.\n\nNow we can use the formula:\n\nnumber of connected components = 7 - 10 + 4 = 1\n\nSo, the graph has 1 connected component."
