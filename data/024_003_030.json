    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface by the position vector:\n\nr(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the first fundamental form by calculating the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [E F]\n    [F G]\n\nwhere E = ru·ru, F = ru·rv, and G = rv·rv. We can compute these as follows:\n\nE = (1, 0, 2u)·(1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = (1, 0, 2u)·(0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = (0, 1, 2v)·(0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form. We first need to find the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = (ru x rv) / ||ru x rv||\n\nru x rv = (2u, 2v, -1)\n||ru x rv|| = sqrt((2u)^2 + (2v)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nN = (2u, 2v, -1) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form by calculating the second partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nruu = d^2r/du^2 = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = d^2r/dudv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = d^2r/dv^2 = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [L M]\n     [M N]\n\nwhere L = N·ruu, M = N·ruv, and N = N·rvv. We can compute these as follows:\n\nL = (2u, 2v, -1)·(0, 0, 2) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = -2 / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\nM = (2u, 2v, -1)·(0, 0, 0) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = 0\nN = (2u, 2v, -1)·(0, 0, 2) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = -2 / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nFinally, we can find the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1) by using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nL = -2 / sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2 + 1) = -2 / 3\nN = -2 / sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2 + 1) = -2 / 3\nM = 0\n\nK = ((-2/3)(-2/3) - 0^2) / (5*5 - 4^2) = (4/9) / 9 = 4/81\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at the point (1,1) is 4/81."
