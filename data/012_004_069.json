    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we need to know the weights of the edges. Since the problem doesn't provide the weights, I will assume arbitrary weights for the edges and demonstrate the process of finding the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.\n\nLet's assume the graph has the following edge weights:\n\n1. Edge A-B: 2\n2. Edge A-C: 3\n3. Edge A-D: 4\n4. Edge A-E: 5\n5. Edge B-C: 1\n6. Edge B-D: 6\n7. Edge B-E: 7\n8. Edge C-D: 8\n\nNow, let's follow Kruskal's algorithm:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n   Sorted edges: (B-C: 1), (A-B: 2), (A-C: 3), (A-D: 4), (A-E: 5), (B-D: 6), (B-E: 7), (C-D: 8)\n\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge doesn't form a cycle.\n\n   - Add edge B-C: 1 (MST: B-C)\n   - Add edge A-B: 2 (MST: A-B, B-C)\n   - Adding edge A-C: 3 would form a cycle (A-B-C-A), so skip this edge.\n   - Add edge A-D: 4 (MST: A-B, B-C, A-D)\n   - Adding edge A-E: 5 would form a cycle (A-B-C-A-E), so skip this edge.\n   - Adding edge B-D: 6 would form a cycle (A-B-D-A), so skip this edge.\n   - Adding edge B-E: 7 would form a cycle (A-B-E-A), so skip this edge.\n   - Adding edge C-D: 8 would form a cycle (A-B-C-D-A), so skip this edge.\n\n4. The algorithm stops when there are (number of nodes - 1) edges in the minimum spanning tree.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm for this example is:\n\nA-B: 2\nB-C: 1\nA-D: 4\n\nTotal weight: 2 + 1 + 4 = 7\n\nPlease note that this is just an example, and the actual minimum spanning tree depends on the edge weights provided."
