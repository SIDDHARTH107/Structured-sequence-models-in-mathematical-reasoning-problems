    "message_2": "To determine the object's position after 3 seconds, we'll first need to find the acceleration, then the velocity as a function of time, and finally the position as a function of time.\n\n1. Find the acceleration:\nSince the force is applied in the opposite direction of the object's initial velocity, we can use Newton's second law of motion, F = ma, to find the acceleration:\n\nF = -10 N (negative sign indicates the opposite direction)\nm = 2 kg\n\na = F/m\na = (-10 N) / (2 kg)\na = -5 m/s²\n\n2. Find the velocity as a function of time:\nThe acceleration is constant, so we can integrate the acceleration function with respect to time to find the velocity function:\n\nv(t) = ∫a dt = ∫(-5) dt = -5t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition: at t = 0, the velocity is 5 m/s to the right:\n\n5 = -5(0) + C\nC = 5\n\nSo the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = -5t + 5\n\n3. Find the position as a function of time:\nNow we integrate the velocity function with respect to time to find the position function:\n\nx(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-5t + 5) dt = -5/2 * t² + 5t + D\n\nTo find the constant D, we need an initial condition for the position. Let's assume the object starts at the origin (x = 0) at t = 0:\n\n0 = -5/2 * (0)² + 5(0) + D\nD = 0\n\nSo the position function is:\n\nx(t) = -5/2 * t² + 5t\n\n4. Determine the object's position after 3 seconds:\nNow we can plug t = 3 seconds into the position function to find the object's position:\n\nx(3) = -5/2 * (3)² + 5(3)\nx(3) = -5/2 * 9 + 15\nx(3) = -45/2 + 15\nx(3) = -45/2 + 30/2\nx(3) = -15/2\n\nThe object's position after 3 seconds is -15/2 meters, or -7.5 meters, to the left of the starting position."
