    "message_1": "Consider a 1-dimensional rod of length 10 cm insulated on both ends. Initially, the rod is at a temperature of 50°C. At time t=0, the ends of the rod are suddenly brought into contact with a heat source of temperature 200°C for a very short time. Using the Fourier transform, find the temperature distribution of the rod as a function of time t, if the thermal conductivity of the rod is 0.5 units and the specific heat is 1 unit. Assume that the initial temperature of the rod is uniformly distributed.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the rod as a function of time t, we will use the 1-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = k * ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, k is the thermal conductivity, and ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x² is the second derivative of the temperature with respect to position x.\n\nWe are given the initial temperature distribution T(x,0) = 50°C for 0 < x < 10 cm. At t=0, the ends of the rod are suddenly brought into contact with a heat source of temperature 200°C for a very short time. This can be modeled as a Dirac delta function, which we will denote as δ(x). The boundary conditions are:\n\nT(0,t) = 200 * δ(t)\nT(10,t) = 200 * δ(t)\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier transform to solve the heat equation. The Fourier transform of T(x,t) is given by:\n\nF(T(x,t)) = ∫(T(x,t) * e^(-iωx)) dx\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to the heat equation, we get:\n\n∂F(T(x,t)) / ∂t = k * (-ω²) * F(T(x,t))\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. Solving this ODE, we get:\n\nF(T(x,t)) = F(T(x,0)) * e^(-kω²t)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of F(T(x,t)) to get T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) * ∫(F(T(x,t)) * e^(iωx)) dω\n\nSubstituting the expression for F(T(x,t)):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) * ∫(F(T(x,0)) * e^(-kω²t) * e^(iωx)) dω\n\nWe know that T(x,0) = 50°C for 0 < x < 10 cm. Therefore, F(T(x,0)) can be found by taking the Fourier transform of a constant function:\n\nF(T(x,0)) = ∫(50 * e^(-iωx)) dx = 50 * (2π) * δ(ω)\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) * ∫(50 * (2π) * δ(ω) * e^(-kω²t) * e^(iωx)) dω\n\nUsing the property of the Dirac delta function, we can simplify the integral:\n\nT(x,t) = 50 + (1/π) * ∫(e^(-kω²t) * cos(ωx)) dω\n\nThe limits of integration are from -∞ to ∞. This integral does not have a closed-form solution, but it can be evaluated numerically for specific values of x and t.\n\nIn summary, the temperature distribution of the rod as a function of time t is given by:\n\nT(x,t) = 50 + (1/π) * ∫(e^(-kω²t) * cos(ωx)) dω\n\nwhere k = 0.5 units, and the limits of integration are from -∞ to ∞."
