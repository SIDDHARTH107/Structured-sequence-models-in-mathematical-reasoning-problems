    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. Then, we will use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 5  2 -1 |  18 |\n| 3 -6  2 | -32 |\n| 2 -1  7 | -27 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we can replace the second row with (-3/5) times the first row plus the second row:\n\n| 5  2  -1 |  18  |\n| 0 -12  5 | -50  |\n| 2 -1   7 | -27  |\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we can replace the third row with (-2/5) times the first row plus the third row:\n\n| 5  2  -1 |  18  |\n| 0 -12  5 | -50  |\n| 0 -5  15 | -45  |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row:\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we can replace the third row with (-5/12) times the second row plus the third row:\n\n| 5  2   -1 |  18  |\n| 0 -12   5 | -50  |\n| 0  0  13 | -10  |\n\nStep 4: Solve for z using back-substitution:\n\nNow that we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix, we can solve for z:\n\n13z = -10\nz = -10/13\n\nStep 5: Solve for y using back-substitution:\n\n-12y + 5z = -50\n-12y + 5(-10/13) = -50\ny = (5(-10/13) + 50) / 12\ny = 2\n\nStep 6: Solve for x using back-substitution:\n\n5x + 2y - z = 18\n5x + 2(2) - (-10/13) = 18\nx = (18 - 4 + 10/13) / 5\nx = 3\n\nThe solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 2, and z = -10/13."
