    "message_1": "A company conducted a survey and found that 60% of customers prefer brand A over brand B. If there are 200 customers in a market, what is the probability that at least 120 customers will choose brand A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, customers choosing brand A)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6 for brand A)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 200 customers)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 120 customers choosing brand A)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 120 customers choosing brand A, we need to find the sum of probabilities from k = 120 to k = 200.\n\nP(X ≥ 120) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 120 to 200\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be tedious, so we can use a cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the probability of 119 or fewer customers choosing brand A, and then subtract this value from 1 to find the probability of at least 120 customers choosing brand A.\n\nP(X ≥ 120) = 1 - P(X ≤ 119)\n\nUsing a binomial CDF calculator or statistical software, we can find the value of P(X ≤ 119) and then subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X ≤ 119) ≈ 0.4119\n\nP(X ≥ 120) = 1 - 0.4119 ≈ 0.5881\n\nSo, the probability that at least 120 customers will choose brand A is approximately 58.81%."
