    "message_2": "To determine the possible values of the real dimension of X, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The cohomology group H^2(X, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ/4ℤ.\n2. The real dimension of X is the dimension of X as a real manifold.\n3. The cohomology group H^2(X, ℤ) is related to the second Betti number b_2(X), which counts the number of independent 2-dimensional cycles in X.\n\nSince H^2(X, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ/4ℤ, this means that the second Betti number b_2(X) = 4. Now, let's consider the possible real dimensions of X.\n\nIf the real dimension of X is 1, then X is a curve. However, curves have no 2-dimensional cycles, so b_2(X) = 0, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nIf the real dimension of X is 2, then X is a surface. In this case, it is possible to have b_2(X) = 4. For example, consider a K3 surface, which is a smooth, compact, complex surface with trivial canonical bundle and H^1(X, ℤ) = 0. The second Betti number of a K3 surface is 22, but we can find a quotient of a K3 surface by a finite group action that results in a surface with b_2(X) = 4. So, a real dimension of 2 is possible.\n\nIf the real dimension of X is 3, then X is a 3-fold. In this case, it is not possible to have b_2(X) = 4. This is because the second Betti number of a 3-fold is always even, and since b_2(X) = 4 is even, it would require the existence of a 4-dimensional cycle, which is not possible in a 3-dimensional space.\n\nIf the real dimension of X is 4 or higher, then it is possible to have b_2(X) = 4. For example, consider a product of two real surfaces with b_2(X) = 2 each. The product will have a real dimension of 4 and b_2(X) = 4.\n\nIn conclusion, the possible values of the real dimension of X are 2 and any even integer greater than or equal to 4."
