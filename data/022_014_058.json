    "message_2": "Since f(z) is analytic except at the origin, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x.\n\nNow, since f(z) is a harmonic function, the Laplacian of f(z) is zero. The Laplacian of a complex-valued function is given by:\n\nΔf(z) = Δ(u + iv) = (Δu) + i(Δv) = 0.\n\nThis implies that both Δu = 0 and Δv = 0. The Laplacian of a real-valued function u(x, y) is given by:\n\nΔu = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y².\n\nSo we have:\n\n∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0.\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to rewrite the Laplacian of u in terms of v:\n\n∂²u/∂x² = ∂(∂v/∂y)/∂x and ∂²u/∂y² = -∂(∂v/∂x)/∂y.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the Laplacian equation for u, we get:\n\n∂(∂v/∂y)/∂x - ∂(∂v/∂x)/∂y = 0.\n\nThis is the Laplacian equation for v, which means that v is also harmonic.\n\nNow, we know that f(1) = 2. Since f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), this means that u(1, 0) = 2 and v(1, 0) = 0.\n\nSince both u and v are harmonic functions, they can be represented by their respective harmonic conjugates. Let g(z) be the harmonic conjugate of f(z), such that g(z) = -v(x, y) + iu(x, y). Then, f(z) + g(z) is an analytic function on the unit disc.\n\nLet h(z) = f(z) + g(z) = u(x, y) - v(x, y) + i(u(x, y) + v(x, y)). We know that h(1) = u(1, 0) - v(1, 0) + i(u(1, 0) + v(1, 0)) = 2 + i2.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that h(z) is analytic to find its power series representation:\n\nh(z) = a₀ + a₁(z - 1) + a₂(z - 1)² + ...\n\nSince h(1) = 2 + i2, we have a₀ = 2 + i2. To find the real-valued function u(x, y), we can take the imaginary part of h(z):\n\nu(x, y) = Im(h(z)) = 2y + a₁y(z - 1) + a₂y(z - 1)² + ...\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the coefficients a₁, a₂, ... without more information about the function f(z). So, the real-valued function u(x, y) can be represented as:\n\nu(x, y) = 2y + a₁y(z - 1) + a₂y(z - 1)² + ...\n\nwhere a₁, a₂, ... are coefficients that depend on the specific function f(z)."
