    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 2  3 -1 |  4 |\n| 4 -1  3 | -2 |\n| 1 -2  1 |  1 |\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 |  2 |\n| 4 -1   3   | -2 |\n| 1 -2   1   |  1 |\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with (-4 times the first row) + second row, and the third row with (-1 times the first row) + third row:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 |  2  |\n| 0 -7   5   | -10 |\n| 0 -3.5 1.5 | -1  |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -7:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 |  2  |\n| 0  1  -5/7  | 10/7|\n| 0 -3.5 1.5  | -1  |\n\nStep 4: Replace the first row with (-1.5 times the second row) + first row, and the third row with (3.5 times the second row) + third row:\n\n| 1  0   1   |  1  |\n| 0  1  -5/7 | 10/7|\n| 0  0   2   |  4  |\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 2:\n\n| 1  0  1 |  1 |\n| 0  1 -5/7| 10/7|\n| 0  0  1 |  2 |\n\nStep 6: Replace the first row with (-1 times the third row) + first row, and the second row with (5/7 times the third row) + second row:\n\n| 1  0  0 | -1 |\n| 0  1  0 |  3 |\n| 0  0  1 |  2 |\n\nThe row echelon form corresponds to the system of equations:\n\nx = -1\ny = 3\nz = 2\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1, y = 3, and z = 2."
