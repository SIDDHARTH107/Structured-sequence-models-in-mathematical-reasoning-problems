    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 5}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow let's find the complement of the union of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of elements not in that set. Since we are not given a universal set, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n(A ∪ B)' = U - (A ∪ B) = { }\n\nNow we will use these sets to prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement. To show this, we need to prove that:\n\n(A ∆ B)' ≠ (A' ∆ B')\n\nFirst, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {4, 5}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B:\n\nA' = U - A = {6, 7, 8}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3}\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B') = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8} - { } = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow we compare the two sets:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {4, 5}\n(A' ∆ B') = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nSince (A ∆ B)' ≠ (A' ∆ B'), we have shown that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
