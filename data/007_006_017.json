    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 72 and 90 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (90) by the smaller number (72) and find the remainder.\n   90 รท 72 = 1 (remainder 18)\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (72) and the smaller number with the remainder (18) from the previous step.\n   Now we have 72 and 18.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0.\n   72 รท 18 = 4 (remainder 0)\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 18.\n\nSo, the GCD of 72 and 90 is 18."
