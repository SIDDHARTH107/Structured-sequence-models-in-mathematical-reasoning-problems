    "message_1": "A rectangular region with sides of length 5cm and 10cm is initially filled with a uniform concentration of a chemical. At time t=0, a small amount of the chemical is added to a very small region at the center of the rectangle. The rate at which the chemical diffuses is proportional to the concentration gradient. \n\nWrite a reaction-diffusion equation that describes this scenario, and compute the concentration of the chemical at the point (2cm, 3cm) after 20 seconds, given that the diffusion rate constant is 0.02 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To describe this scenario, we can use the reaction-diffusion equation, which is given by the following partial differential equation:\n\n∂C/∂t = D * ( ∂²C/∂x² + ∂²C/∂y² )\n\nwhere C is the concentration of the chemical, t is time, D is the diffusion rate constant, and x and y are the spatial coordinates.\n\nSince the chemical is added at the center of the rectangle, we can assume that the initial concentration distribution is given by a Dirac delta function:\n\nC(x, y, 0) = M * δ(x - 2.5) * δ(y - 5)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the chemical added and δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we need to solve the reaction-diffusion equation to find the concentration at point (2cm, 3cm) after 20 seconds. To do this, we can use the method of separation of variables and Fourier series. However, this process is quite involved and requires advanced knowledge of partial differential equations and Fourier analysis.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fundamental solution of the diffusion equation, which is given by the Gaussian function:\n\nG(x, y, t) = (1 / (4 * π * D * t)) * exp(-((x - 2.5)² + (y - 5)²) / (4 * D * t))\n\nThe concentration at point (2cm, 3cm) after 20 seconds can be computed by evaluating the Gaussian function at this point:\n\nC(2, 3, 20) = (1 / (4 * π * 0.02 * 20)) * exp(-((2 - 2.5)² + (3 - 5)²) / (4 * 0.02 * 20))\n\nC(2, 3, 20) ≈ 0.00198 mol/cm²\n\nSo, the concentration of the chemical at point (2cm, 3cm) after 20 seconds is approximately 0.00198 mol/cm²."
