    "message_2": "To find the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood on any given day, we can use the historical data provided. \n\nThere were 5 burglaries in the past 100 days. So, the probability of a burglary occurring on any given day can be calculated as:\n\nProbability = (Number of burglaries) / (Total number of days)\nProbability = 5 / 100\n\nProbability = 0.05 or 5%\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood on any given day is 5%."
