    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on $x$ and the other depending on $t$. So, let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nHere, $-\\lambda$ is the separation constant. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $T'(t) = -k\\lambda T(t)$\n2. $X''(x) = -\\lambda X(x)$\n\nLet's solve the second equation first. Since we have boundary conditions $u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0$, we can write the general solution for $X(x)$ as:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $X(0) = B = 0$ and $X(1) = A\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 0$. Since $A$ cannot be zero (trivial solution), we must have $\\sqrt{\\lambda} = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$. Thus, $\\lambda = n^2\\pi^2$, and the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation. The general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\exp(-k\\lambda t)$$\n\nSo, the solution for $u(x,t)$ is:\n\n$$u_n(x,t) = A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\exp(-n^2\\pi^2 t)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients $A_n$ using the initial condition $u(x,0) = x(1-x)$. We can write the initial condition as a Fourier sine series:\n\n$$x(1-x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\n$$A_n = 2\\int_0^1 x(1-x)\\sin(n\\pi x) dx$$\n\nIntegrating by parts twice, we get:\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{2}{n\\pi}(-1)^{n+1}$$\n\nFinally, the solution for $u(x,t)$ is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n\\pi}(-1)^{n+1}\\sin(n\\pi x)\\exp(-n^2\\pi^2 t)$$\n\nThis is the solution for $0\\leq x\\leq1$ and $0\\leq t\\leq1$."
