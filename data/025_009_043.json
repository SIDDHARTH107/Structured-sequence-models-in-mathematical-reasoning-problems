    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the tangent space at a general point of the moduli space $M_3$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem and the deformation theory of algebraic curves.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Riemann-Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g$ and a divisor $D$ on $X$. The theorem states that:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_X - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$,\n\nwhere $l(D)$ denotes the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of $D$, $K_X$ is the canonical divisor, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nNow, let's consider the deformation theory of algebraic curves. For a curve $C$ of genus $g$, the dimension of the tangent space to the moduli space at the point corresponding to $C$ is given by the dimension of the space of first-order deformations of $C$, which is equal to the dimension of the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials on $C$. Quadratic differentials are sections of the square of the canonical bundle, so we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute their dimension.\n\nLet $D = 2K_C$, where $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$. Then, we have:\n\n$l(2K_C) - l(K_C - 2K_C) = \\deg(2K_C) + 1 - g$.\n\nSince $K_C - 2K_C = -K_C$, we have $l(K_C - 2K_C) = l(-K_C) = 0$, because there are no meromorphic functions with only zeroes on a compact Riemann surface. Moreover, $\\deg(2K_C) = 2\\deg(K_C) = 2(2g - 2) = 4g - 4$, as the degree of the canonical divisor is $2g - 2$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$l(2K_C) = 4g - 4 + 1 - g = 3g - 3$.\n\nFor $g = 3$, we obtain:\n\n$l(2K_C) = 3(3) - 3 = 6$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the tangent space at a general point of the moduli space $M_3$ is 6."
