    "message_2": "The Riemann mapping theorem states that there exists a unique conformal mapping between simply connected domains, except for the whole complex plane. In this case, we are looking for a conformal mapping between the unit disk $D(0,1)$ and the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$.\n\nA commonly used conformal mapping for this purpose is the Möbius transformation. The Möbius transformation is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. To find the specific transformation that maps the unit disk onto the upper half-plane, we can use the following transformation:\n\n$$f(z) = i\\frac{1 - z}{1 + z}$$\n\nThis transformation has the following properties:\n\n1. It maps the origin (0) of the unit disk to the origin of the upper half-plane: $f(0) = i\\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = i$.\n2. It maps the boundary of the unit disk (|z| = 1) to the real axis (Im(z) = 0).\n3. It is conformal, as it is a Möbius transformation.\n\nSo, the conformal mapping of the unit disk $D(0,1)$ onto the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ using the Riemann mapping theorem is:\n\n$$f(z) = i\\frac{1 - z}{1 + z}$$"
