    "message_2": "To find the expected number of houses that will experience a robbery in a week, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number of houses = Total number of houses × Probability of a robbery\n\nIn this case, there are 10 houses on the street and the probability of a robbery occurring is 0.15. So, we can calculate the expected number of houses as follows:\n\nExpected number of houses = 10 × 0.15 = 1.5\n\nTherefore, the expected number of houses that will experience a robbery in a week is 1.5."
