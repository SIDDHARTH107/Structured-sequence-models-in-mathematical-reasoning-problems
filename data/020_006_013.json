    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products – Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 4 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor, while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor. The factory has 200 hours of machine time and 100 hours of labor available each day. The profit per unit for Product A is $10 and for Product B is $15. How many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize their profit, while taking into consideration that they must produce at least 5 units of Product A and at least 10 units of Product B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Machine time constraint: 4x + 2y ≤ 200\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 2y ≤ 100\n3. Minimum production constraint for Product A: x ≥ 5\n4. Minimum production constraint for Product B: y ≥ 10\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the labor constraint:\n\n2x + 2y ≤ 100\nx + y ≤ 50\n\nNow, we can graph the constraints and find the feasible region:\n\n1. 4x + 2y ≤ 200\n   y ≤ (200 - 4x) / 2\n   y ≤ 100 - 2x\n\n2. x + y ≤ 50\n   y ≤ 50 - x\n\n3. x ≥ 5\n4. y ≥ 10\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (5, 10), (5, 45), (20, 30), and (40, 10).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(5, 10) = 10(5) + 15(10) = 50 + 150 = $200\n2. P(5, 45) = 10(5) + 15(45) = 50 + 675 = $725\n3. P(20, 30) = 10(20) + 15(30) = 200 + 450 = $650\n4. P(40, 10) = 10(40) + 15(10) = 400 + 150 = $550\n\nThe maximum profit is $725, which occurs when the factory produces 5 units of Product A and 45 units of Product B."
