    "message_1": "A right circular cone has a height of 8 cm and diameter of 10 cm. What is the volume of the cone? (Use pi=3.14)",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a right circular cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, h is the height, and π is approximately 3.14.\n\nGiven the diameter of the cone is 10 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 5 cm. The height (h) is given as 8 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 3.14 × (5 cm)² × 8 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 3.14 × 25 cm² × 8 cm\n\nVolume = 3.14 × 25 cm² × (8/3) cm\n\nVolume ≈ 209.333 cm³\n\nThe volume of the cone is approximately 209.333 cubic centimeters."
