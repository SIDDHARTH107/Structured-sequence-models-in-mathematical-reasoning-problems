    "message_2": "To find all the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 32, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. The order of the group is 32, which is 2^5. According to the theorem, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order. So, we need to find all the possible partitions of 5 (the exponent of 2) and create the corresponding direct sums of cyclic groups.\n\n1. 5: This corresponds to a single cyclic group of order 2^5, which is isomorphic to Z_32.\n\n2. 4 + 1: This corresponds to a direct sum of a cyclic group of order 2^4 and a cyclic group of order 2^1, which is isomorphic to Z_16 x Z_2.\n\n3. 3 + 2: This corresponds to a direct sum of a cyclic group of order 2^3 and a cyclic group of order 2^2, which is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_4.\n\n4. 3 + 1 + 1: This corresponds to a direct sum of a cyclic group of order 2^3, a cyclic group of order 2^1, and another cyclic group of order 2^1, which is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n\n5. 2 + 2 + 1: This corresponds to a direct sum of a cyclic group of order 2^2, another cyclic group of order 2^2, and a cyclic group of order 2^1, which is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2.\n\n6. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1: This corresponds to a direct sum of a cyclic group of order 2^2, a cyclic group of order 2^1, another cyclic group of order 2^1, and another cyclic group of order 2^1, which is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n\n7. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1: This corresponds to a direct sum of five cyclic groups of order 2^1, which is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n\nThese are all the possible isomorphism classes of abelian groups of order 32. However, there are also non-abelian groups of order 32. One such example is the Quaternion group of order 32, denoted as Q_32. Another example is the dihedral group of order 32, denoted as D_32.\n\nIn total, there are 9 isomorphism classes of groups of order 32:\n\n1. Z_32\n2. Z_16 x Z_2\n3. Z_8 x Z_4\n4. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2\n5. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2\n6. Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n7. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n8. Q_32 (Quaternion group)\n9. D_32 (Dihedral group)"
