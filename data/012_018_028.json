    "message_2": "To disconnect a connected graph into two non-empty components, we need to remove edges that form a cut-set. A cut-set is a set of edges whose removal results in the graph being disconnected.\n\nIn this case, we have a connected graph G with 8 vertices. To find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed, we can use the concept of vertex connectivity. Vertex connectivity (k) is the minimum number of vertices that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. The relationship between vertex connectivity and edge connectivity (λ) is given by:\n\nλ(G) ≤ k(G) ≤ δ(G)\n\nwhere δ(G) is the minimum degree of the vertices in the graph.\n\nSince we have 8 vertices and 15 edges, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 15) / 8 = 3.75. This means that there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less (by the Pigeonhole Principle). Therefore, δ(G) ≤ 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of vertices that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. Since the graph is connected, removing one vertex will not disconnect it. However, removing two vertices can potentially disconnect the graph.\n\nFor example, consider a cycle of 6 vertices (a hexagon) with two additional vertices connected to one of the vertices in the cycle. Removing the vertex in the cycle that is connected to the two additional vertices and one of the additional vertices will disconnect the graph into two non-empty components.\n\nThus, k(G) = 2. Since λ(G) ≤ k(G), we can conclude that the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph into two non-empty components is 2."
