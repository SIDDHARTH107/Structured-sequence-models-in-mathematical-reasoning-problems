    "message_1": "There are 4 volunteers who are willing to raise money for a charity by selling raffle tickets. Each volunteer has the option to either sell 10 tickets or 20 tickets. If all the volunteers sell 20 tickets, the charity will receive $400. However, if any one of the volunteers decides to only sell 10 tickets while others sell 20, then the charity will only receive $250. What should each volunteer do to maximize the money raised for the charity?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the money raised for the charity, each volunteer should sell 20 tickets. If all 4 volunteers sell 20 tickets each, the charity will receive $400, which is the maximum amount possible in this scenario. If any volunteer sells only 10 tickets, the charity will receive only $250, which is less than the maximum amount."
