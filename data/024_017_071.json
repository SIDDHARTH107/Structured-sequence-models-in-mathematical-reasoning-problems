Find the parallel transport of the velocity vector to a point Q on the curve, where t = π/2.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the velocity vector, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve r(t) at any point t. Then, we will find the parallel transport of the given velocity vector (3, 1, 2) from point P to point Q along the curve.\n\n1. Find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve r(t):\n\nThe tangent vector T(t) is the derivative of the position vector r(t) with respect to t:\n\nT(t) = r'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 2t)\n\n2. Find the value of t at point P:\n\nWe are given the velocity vector at point P as (3, 1, 2). We can equate this to the tangent vector T(t) to find the value of t at point P:\n\n(3, 1, 2) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 2t)\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get t = 0 (approximately) for point P.\n\n3. Find the tangent vector T(t) at point Q:\n\nWe are given that t = π/2 at point Q. So, we can find the tangent vector T(t) at point Q:\n\nT(π/2) = (-sin(π/2), cos(π/2), 2(π/2)) = (0, 1, π)\n\n4. Find the parallel transport of the velocity vector (3, 1, 2) from point P to point Q:\n\nThe parallel transport of a vector along a curve is obtained by keeping the angle between the vector and the tangent vector constant. Since the angle between the given velocity vector (3, 1, 2) and the tangent vector T(0) = (0, 1, 0) at point P is 0 degrees, we need to find a vector at point Q that has the same angle with the tangent vector T(π/2) = (0, 1, π) at point Q.\n\nLet the parallel transport of the velocity vector (3, 1, 2) at point Q be (a, b, c). Then, the dot product of this vector with the tangent vector T(π/2) should be equal to the dot product of the velocity vector (3, 1, 2) with the tangent vector T(0) at point P:\n\n(a, b, c) · (0, 1, π) = (3, 1, 2) · (0, 1, 0)\nbπ = 1\n\nNow, we need to find a, b, and c such that the angle between (a, b, c) and (0, 1, π) is 0 degrees. Since the angle between the given velocity vector (3, 1, 2) and the tangent vector T(0) = (0, 1, 0) at point P is 0 degrees, we can assume that the parallel transport of the velocity vector (3, 1, 2) at point Q is proportional to the tangent vector T(π/2) = (0, 1, π) at point Q:\n\n(a, b, c) = k(0, 1, π) = (0, k, kπ)\n\nSubstituting b = k and c = kπ into the equation bπ = 1, we get:\n\nkπ^2 = 1\nk = 1/π^2\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the velocity vector (3, 1, 2) at point Q is:\n\n(a, b, c) = (0, 1/π^2, 1/π)"
