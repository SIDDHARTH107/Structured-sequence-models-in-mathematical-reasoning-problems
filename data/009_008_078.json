    "message_2": "To determine the speed, amplitude, wavelength, and frequency of the wave, we need to analyze the given wave equation:\n\ny(x, t) = 7sin(5x - 12t)\n\nThis equation is in the form of a sinusoidal wave equation:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and x and t are position and time, respectively.\n\nComparing the given equation with the general form, we can identify the following:\n\nAmplitude (A):\nA = 7\n\nWave number (k):\nk = 5\n\nAngular frequency (ω):\nω = 12\n\nNow, we can determine the speed, wavelength, and frequency of the wave using the following relationships:\n\n1. Wavelength (λ) is related to the wave number (k) by the equation:\nλ = 2π / k\n\n2. Frequency (f) is related to the angular frequency (ω) by the equation:\nf = ω / 2π\n\n3. Speed (v) is related to the wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) by the equation:\nv = λ * f\n\nCalculating the wavelength (λ):\nλ = 2π / k = 2π / 5 ≈ 1.2566 units\n\nCalculating the frequency (f):\nf = ω / 2π = 12 / 2π ≈ 1.9099 Hz\n\nCalculating the speed (v):\nv = λ * f ≈ 1.2566 * 1.9099 ≈ 2.4000 units/s\n\nSo, the wave has the following properties:\nAmplitude: 7 units\nWavelength: ≈ 1.2566 units\nFrequency: ≈ 1.9099 Hz\nSpeed: ≈ 2.4000 units/s"
