    "message_2": "To determine the order of the pole of $f(z)$ at $z=0$, we first need to find the limit of $f(z)$ as $z$ approaches $0$. We can use L'Hopital's rule for this purpose:\n\n$$\\lim_{z\\to 0} \\frac{z}{e^z - 1} = \\lim_{z\\to 0} \\frac{1}{e^z} = 1$$\n\nSince the limit exists and is non-zero, $z=0$ is not a pole of $f(z)$. However, we can see that $f(z)$ has a removable singularity at $z=0$. To find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z=0$, we can use the following formula for the residue of a function with a removable singularity:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), z=0) = \\lim_{z\\to 0} (z - 0)f(z) = \\lim_{z\\to 0} zf(z)$$\n\nNow, we can use L'Hopital's rule again to find the limit:\n\n$$\\lim_{z\\to 0} zf(z) = \\lim_{z\\to 0} \\frac{z^2}{e^z - 1} = \\lim_{z\\to 0} \\frac{2z}{e^z} = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the residue of $f(z)$ at $z=0$ is $0$. In conclusion, $f(z)$ has a removable singularity at $z=0$ with a residue of $0$."
