    "message_2": "A 3-round Feistel Network using a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits means that each round uses a 32-bit key. Since there are 2^32 possible keys for each round, we can calculate the total number of possible keys for the entire network as follows:\n\nTotal possible keys = (2^32) * (2^32) * (2^32)\n\nTotal possible keys = 2^(32+32+32)\n\nTotal possible keys = 2^96\n\nSo, there are 2^96 possible keys in total for a 3-round Feistel Network with the given specifications."
