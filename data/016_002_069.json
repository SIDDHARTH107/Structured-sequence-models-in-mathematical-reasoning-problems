    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake curve is a fractal that begins with an equilateral triangle and iteratively adds smaller equilateral triangles to each side. At each iteration, the length of each side is divided into three equal parts, and a smaller equilateral triangle is added to the middle part.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve at the nth iteration as P(n). The perimeter at the first iteration (the initial equilateral triangle) is P(1) = 3 units, as there are three sides of length 1 unit each.\n\nAt each iteration, the length of each side is multiplied by 4/3, as we replace one side of length 1 with four sides of length 1/3. Therefore, the perimeter at the nth iteration can be calculated as:\n\nP(n) = P(1) * (4/3)^(n-1)\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we have:\n\nP(4) = 3 * (4/3)^3\nP(4) = 3 * (64/27)\nP(4) = 192/27 â‰ˆ 7.111\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve at the 4th iteration is approximately 7.111 units."
