    "message_2": "Symplectic geometry is not the most suitable method for finding the area inside an ellipse, as it is primarily concerned with the study of Hamiltonian mechanics and phase spaces. However, we can still find the area inside the given curve using basic geometry techniques.\n\nThe equation of the curve is x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1, where a = 3 and b = 4. This is the equation of an ellipse with semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b. The area inside the ellipse can be found using the formula:\n\nArea = π * a * b\n\nSubstituting the given values of a and b, we get:\n\nArea = π * 3 * 4 = 12π\n\nSo, the area inside the curve is 12π square units."
