    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the intersection of A and B. Show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection by proving that (A ⊕ B) ∩ B ≠ (B ⊕ A) ∩ B where ⊕ represents symmetric difference.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ⊕ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements which are in both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nNow we need to show that (A ⊕ B) ∩ B ≠ (B ⊕ A) ∩ B. Since symmetric difference is commutative, we know that A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A. So we just need to find (A ⊕ B) ∩ B and compare it to (B ⊕ A) ∩ B.\n\n(A ⊕ B) ∩ B = {1, 2, 5} ∩ {3, 4, 5} = {5}\n\n(B ⊕ A) ∩ B = {1, 2, 5} ∩ {3, 4, 5} = {5}\n\nSince (A ⊕ B) ∩ B = {5} and (B ⊕ A) ∩ B = {5}, we can see that (A ⊕ B) ∩ B = (B ⊕ A) ∩ B. This means that the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection, which is the opposite of what was asked to be proven."
