The capacity of the roads is given in the table below:\n\n| Road | Capacity (in vehicles) |\n|------|-----------------------|\n|  A-B |           3           |\n|  A-C |           2           |\n|  B-C |           2           |\n|  B-D |           3           |\n|  C-D |           1           |\n|  C-E |           3           |\n|  D-E |           2           |\n|  D-F |           3           |\n|  E-F |           4           |\n\nWhat is the maximum number of vehicles that can be transported from city A to city F per hour if the flow through the network is optimized?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of vehicles that can be transported from city A to city F per hour, we can use the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem. We will find the maximum flow through the network by identifying the bottleneck capacities in the different paths from A to F.\n\nThere are three possible paths from city A to city F:\n\n1. A → B → D → F\n2. A → C → D → F\n3. A → C → E → F\n\nLet's find the bottleneck capacities for each path:\n\n1. A → B → D → F: The minimum capacity in this path is min(3, 3, 3) = 3 vehicles.\n2. A → C → D → F: The minimum capacity in this path is min(2, 1, 3) = 1 vehicle.\n3. A → C → E → F: The minimum capacity in this path is min(2, 3, 4) = 2 vehicles.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum flow through the network by adding the bottleneck capacities of the paths:\n\nMaximum flow = 3 (A → B → D → F) + 1 (A → C → D → F) + 2 (A → C → E → F) = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 vehicles.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of vehicles that can be transported from city A to city F per hour if the flow through the network is optimized is 6 vehicles."
