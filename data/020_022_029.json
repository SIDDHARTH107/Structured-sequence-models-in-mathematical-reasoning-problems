    "message_1": "A farmer has a field with an area of 5000 square meters to plant two different crops, corn and wheat. The farmer estimates that each square meter of corn requires 3 kg of fertilizer and 4 hours of labor, while each square meter of wheat requires only 2 kg of fertilizer and 2.5 hours of labor. The farmer has 18000 kg of fertilizer and 150 hours of labor available. If the profit per square meter of corn is $3 and for wheat it is $4, how many square meters should the farmer plant with each crop to maximize profits?",
    "message_2": "Let's use x to represent the number of square meters planted with corn and y to represent the number of square meters planted with wheat. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. Total area constraint: x + y ≤ 5000\n2. Fertilizer constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 18000\n3. Labor constraint: 4x + 2.5y ≤ 15000\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 3x + 4y.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\n1. y ≤ 5000 - x\n2. y ≤ (18000 - 3x) / 2\n3. y ≤ (15000 - 4x) / 2.5\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the intersection points of these inequalities:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\nx + y = 5000\n3x + 2y = 18000\n\nSolve for x and y:\n2x = 3000\nx = 1500\ny = 5000 - 1500 = 3500\n\nIntersection of (1) and (3):\nx + y = 5000\n4x + 2.5y = 15000\n\nSolve for x and y:\n0.5y = 2500\ny = 5000\nx = 5000 - 5000 = 0\n\nIntersection of (2) and (3):\n3x + 2y = 18000\n4x + 2.5y = 15000\n\nSolve for x and y:\nx = 6000 - 2y\n4(6000 - 2y) + 2.5y = 15000\n\n24000 - 8y + 2.5y = 15000\n-5.5y = -9000\ny = 1636.36 (approximately)\n\nx = 6000 - 2(1636.36) = 2727.27 (approximately)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\nP(1500, 3500) = 3(1500) + 4(3500) = 4500 + 14000 = 18500\nP(0, 5000) = 3(0) + 4(5000) = 0 + 20000 = 20000\nP(2727.27, 1636.36) = 3(2727.27) + 4(1636.36) = 8181.81 + 6545.44 = 14727.25 (approximately)\n\nThe maximum profit is $20,000, which occurs when the farmer plants 0 square meters of corn and 5000 square meters of wheat."
