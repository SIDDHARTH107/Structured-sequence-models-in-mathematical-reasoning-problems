    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of equations in an augmented matrix form:\n\n| 1  1  1 | 10.2 |\n| 2  3 0.5 | 24.1 |\n| 1  2  2  | 18.5 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first variable (x) from the second and third rows.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - Row1\n\n| 1  1    1   | 10.2 |\n| 0  1 -0.5 |   3.7  |\n| 0  1    1   |   8.3  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second variable (y) from the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 - Row2\n\n| 1  1    1   | 10.2 |\n| 0  1 -0.5 |   3.7  |\n| 0  0  1.5  |   4.6  |\n\nStep 3: Solve for the third variable (z).\n\n1.5z = 4.6\nz = 4.6 / 1.5\nz ≈ 3.1\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute the value of z to find the values of y and x.\n\ny - 0.5z = 3.7\ny - 0.5(3.1) ≈ 3.7\ny ≈ 1.2\n\nx + y + z = 10.2\nx + 1.2 + 3.1 = 10.2\nx ≈ 5.9\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is approximately x = 5.9, y = 1.2, and z = 3.1."
