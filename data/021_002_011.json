    "message_2": "To find the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of matrix A using the power iteration method, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess vector, v0 = [1, 1].\n2. Compute the product of A and v0, Av0.\n3. Normalize Av0 to get the new vector v1.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the difference between consecutive vectors is less than the tolerance.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method:\n\nInitial guess vector, v0 = [1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\nAv0 = [3*1 + 1*1, 2*1 + 6*1] = [4, 8]\nv1 = [4/8, 8/8] = [0.5, 1]\n\nIteration 2:\nAv1 = [3*0.5 + 1*1, 2*0.5 + 6*1] = [2.5, 7]\nv2 = [2.5/7, 7/7] = [0.3571, 1]\n\nIteration 3:\nAv2 = [3*0.3571 + 1*1, 2*0.3571 + 6*1] = [2.0714, 6.7143]\nv3 = [2.0714/6.7143, 6.7143/6.7143] = [0.3085, 1]\n\nIteration 4:\nAv3 = [3*0.3085 + 1*1, 2*0.3085 + 6*1] = [1.9255, 6.617]\nv4 = [1.9255/6.617, 6.617/6.617] = [0.2909, 1]\n\nThe difference between v4 and v3 is less than the tolerance of 0.001, so we can stop the iteration here.\n\nNow, we can find the largest eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue = (v4' * A * v4) / (v4' * v4)\nEigenvalue = ([0.2909, 1] * [3 1 ; 2 6] * [0.2909, 1]') / ([0.2909, 1] * [0.2909, 1]')\nEigenvalue = (0.2909*3 + 1*1, 0.2909*2 + 1*6) * [0.2909, 1]'\nEigenvalue = (1.8727, 6.5818) * [0.2909, 1]'\nEigenvalue = 1.8727*0.2909 + 6.5818*1\nEigenvalue â‰ˆ 6.53\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue is approximately 6.53, and the corresponding eigenvector is [0.2909, 1]."
