B ∩ A = {2, 3} (Intersection is commutative, so A ∩ B = B ∩ A)\n\n5. (A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nNow, let's analyze the results:\n\nA x B ≠ B x A, as the ordered pairs in the Cartesian products are different. The Cartesian product is not commutative.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the commutativity of the Cartesian product with respect to intersection. In other words, is (A x B) ∩ (B x A) = (B x A) ∩ (A x B)?\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n(B x A) ∩ (A x B) = {(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nSince (A x B) ∩ (B x A) = (B x A) ∩ (A x B), we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is commutative with respect to intersection."
