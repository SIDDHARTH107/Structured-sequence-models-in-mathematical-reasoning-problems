Choose a public key exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1 (e and φ(n) are coprime)\nLet's choose e = 7 (it is a common choice and satisfies the conditions)\n\n4. Compute the private key exponent d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1\nWe need to find a value for d such that (7 * d) % 1080 = 1\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 463 satisfies this condition.\n\nSo, the public key is (n, e) = (1147, 7) and the private key is (n, d) = (1147, 463)."
