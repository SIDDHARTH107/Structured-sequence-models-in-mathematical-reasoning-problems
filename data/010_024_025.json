    "message_2": "In the hyperbolic plane H(-1) with curvature -1, the area of a triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the area of a hyperbolic triangle is equal to the difference between the sum of its angles and pi (π).\n\nIn this case, the triangle has angles of 60, 70, and 50 degrees. First, we need to convert these angles to radians:\n\n60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n70 degrees = (70 * π) / 180 = 7π/18 radians\n50 degrees = (50 * π) / 180 = 5π/18 radians\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the angles:\n\nSum of angles = π/3 + 7π/18 + 5π/18 = (6π + 7π + 5π) / 18 = 18π/18 = π radians\n\nFinally, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (Sum of angles) - π = π - π = 0\n\nSo, the area of the triangle in the hyperbolic plane H(-1) with curvature -1 is 0."
