    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = {1, 4} (since 1 is in A but not in B, and 4 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow let's calculate the Cartesian products:\n\n1. (A △ B) × A = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n2. B × A = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of these two Cartesian products:\n\n1. (A △ B) × A △ (B × A) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then the Cartesian product with A:\n\n1. A × (B △ A) = {(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of this Cartesian product and the Cartesian product of B and A:\n\n2. A × (B △ A) △ (B × A) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4)}\n\nComparing the results of (A △ B) × A △ (B × A) and A × (B △ A) △ (B × A), we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A △ B) × A △ (B × A) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nA × (B △ A) △ (B × A) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4)}\n\nSince the results are not equal, this demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to Cartesian product."
