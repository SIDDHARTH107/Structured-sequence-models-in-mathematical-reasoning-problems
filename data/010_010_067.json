    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2 + y^2$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$3x^2 - 6x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now, we can substitute this into the first equation:\n\n$3x^2 - 6x = 0$\n\n$x(3x - 6) = 0$\n\n$x = 0$ or $x = 2$\n\nSo, we have two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points using Morse theory. To do this, we will compute the Hessian matrix of the function and evaluate it at the critical points. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 6$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2$\n\nNow, we can write the Hessian matrix:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x - 6 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the Hessian matrix at the critical points:\n\nAt $(0, 0)$:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-6 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $(-6)(2) - (0)(0) = -12$. Since the determinant is negative, the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a saddle point.\n\nAt $(2, 0)$:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $(6)(2) - (0)(0) = 12$. Since the determinant is positive and the second partial derivative with respect to $x$ is positive, the critical point $(2, 0)$ is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found two critical points: $(0, 0)$ is a saddle point, and $(2, 0)$ is a local minimum."
