    "message_2": "(a) To find the explicit solution to the heat equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(z, t) = X(z)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(z)T'(t) = X''(z)T(t)$$\n\nDividing both sides by $XT$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(z)}{X(z)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a separation constant. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$T'(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$$\n$$X''(z) + \\lambda X(z) = 0$$\n\nThe solution to the first equation is:\n\n$$T(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n\nFor the second equation, we assume $\\lambda = k^2$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Then, the solution is:\n\n$$X(z) = A e^{kz} + B e^{-kz}$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution to the heat equation as:\n\n$$u(z, t) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{C}} (A e^{kz} + B e^{-kz}) e^{-k^2 t}$$\n\nTo satisfy the initial condition $u(z, 0) = e^{-z^2}$, we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of the initial condition is:\n\n$$\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-z^2} e^{-ikz} dz = e^{-k^2/4}$$\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform, we get:\n\n$$u(z, t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-k^2/4} e^{-k^2 t} e^{ikz} dk$$\n\nThis is the explicit solution to the heat equation for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $t \\geq 0$.\n\n(b) To compute the maximum value of $\\operatorname{Re}(u(z, t))$, we can differentiate $u(z, t)$ with respect to $z$ and set the result to zero:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\operatorname{Re}(u(z, t))}{\\partial z} = 0$$\n\nSolving this equation, we find that the maximum value of $\\operatorname{Re}(u(z, t))$ occurs at $z = 0$. Evaluating $u(z, t)$ at this point, we get:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Re}(u(0, t)) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-k^2/4} e^{-k^2 t} dk$$\n\nTo find the time $t_{\\text{max}}$ at which the maximum value is attained, we can differentiate $\\operatorname{Re}(u(0, t))$ with respect to $t$ and set the result to zero:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\operatorname{Re}(u(0, t))}{\\partial t} = 0$$\n\nSolving this equation, we find that the maximum value of $\\operatorname{Re}(u(z, t))$ is attained at $t_{\\text{max}} = 1/4$.\n\n(c) To show that there exists a unique solution to the heat equation that satisfies the initial condition for all $t > 0$, we can use the energy method. The energy of the solution $u(z, t)$ is defined as:\n\n$$E(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |u(z, t)|^2 dz$$\n\nTaking the time derivative of the energy, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{dE(t)}{dt} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 2u(z, t)u_t(z, t) dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 2u(z, t)u_{zz}(z, t) dz$$\n\nIntegrating by parts, we find that:\n\n$$\\frac{dE(t)}{dt} = -2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |u_z(z, t)|^2 dz \\leq 0$$\n\nThis implies that the energy of the solution is non-increasing in time. Since the energy is finite for all $t > 0$, there exists a unique solution to the heat equation that satisfies the initial condition.\n\nTo show that this solution is holomorphic in $z$ for any fixed $t > 0$, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The heat equation can be written as:\n\n$$u_t(z, t) = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$$\n\nwhere $z = x + iy$. Since the heat equation is linear and the initial condition is holomorphic, the solution $u(z, t)$ is also holomorphic in $z$ for any fixed $t > 0$."
