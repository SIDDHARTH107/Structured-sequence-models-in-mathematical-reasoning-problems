The initial temperature of the sheet is 20°C, and the temperatures at the heated and cooled sides are maintained at 100°C and 0°C, respectively. The thermal diffusivity of stainless steel is known to be 4.2 x 10^-6 m^2/s. Using the heat transfer and diffusion equations, calculate the time required for the sheet to attain a steady-state temperature, and determine the steady-state temperature of the sheet.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the heat diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∇²T\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator.\n\nFor a one-dimensional problem like this, the Laplacian operator simplifies to the second derivative with respect to the spatial coordinate x:\n\n∇²T = ∂²T/∂x²\n\nIn steady-state conditions, the temperature distribution does not change with time, so ∂T/∂t = 0. The heat diffusion equation then becomes:\n\n0 = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nTo solve this equation, we can integrate twice with respect to x:\n\n∂T/∂x = C1\nT(x) = C1x + C2\n\nNow we can apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. At x = 0, T = 0°C:\n0 = C1(0) + C2\nC2 = 0\n\n2. At x = 0.05 m, T = 100°C:\n100 = C1(0.05) + 0\nC1 = 100 / 0.05 = 2000\n\nSo the steady-state temperature distribution is given by:\n\nT(x) = 2000x\n\nNow, to estimate the time required to reach the steady-state, we can use the rule of thumb that the system reaches steady-state after a time of about 5τ, where τ is the thermal time constant, given by:\n\nτ = L² / (π²α)\n\nwhere L is the thickness of the sheet (0.05 m). Plugging in the values:\n\nτ = (0.05)² / (π² * 4.2 x 10^-6) ≈ 0.000597 s\n\nSo the time required to reach steady-state is approximately:\n\nt ≈ 5τ ≈ 5 * 0.000597 ≈ 0.002985 s\n\nIn summary, the steady-state temperature distribution is T(x) = 2000x, and the time required to reach steady-state is approximately 0.002985 seconds."
