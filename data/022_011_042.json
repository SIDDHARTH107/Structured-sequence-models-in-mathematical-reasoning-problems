    "message_2": "To find the zeros of $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the numerator of the function is equal to zero. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$2z^2 - 5z + 3 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n$(2z - 1)(z - 3) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two zeros:\n\n$z_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $z_2 = 3$\n\nBoth zeros have order 1, as they are simple roots of the numerator.\n\nNow, to find the poles of $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator of the function is equal to zero. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$z^2 - 4 = 0$\n\nThis equation can be factored as:\n\n$(z - 2)(z + 2) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two poles:\n\n$p_1 = 2$ and $p_2 = -2$\n\nBoth poles have order 1, as they are simple roots of the denominator.\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z)$ has two zeros, $z_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $z_2 = 3$, both of order 1, and two poles, $p_1 = 2$ and $p_2 = -2$, also both of order 1."
