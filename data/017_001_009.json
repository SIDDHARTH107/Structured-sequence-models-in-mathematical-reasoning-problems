    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider the possible orders of elements in G and use Lagrange's theorem.\n\nLagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup H of a finite group G must divide the order of G. In our case, the order of G is 4. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nIf G has an element of order 4, let's call it a. Then, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is cyclic and isomorphic to C4, the cyclic group of order 4.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let's say G = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c are distinct non-identity elements. Since the order of each element is 2, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\n\nNow, consider the product ab. Since a and b are distinct and have order 2, ab cannot be equal to a or b. Also, ab cannot be equal to e because that would imply a = b^(-1) = b, which contradicts the fact that a and b are distinct. Therefore, ab = c.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that bc = a and ac = b. Thus, G has the following multiplication table:\n\n```\n  e  a  b  c\ne e  a  b  c\na a  e  c  b\nb b  c  e  a\nc c  b  a  e\n```\n\nThis multiplication table corresponds to the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, in this case, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C4 or V4, depending on whether it has an element of order 4 or not."
