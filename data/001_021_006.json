    "message_2": "To find the solutions to the polynomial equation x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0, we can use factoring or synthetic division to find the roots.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nNow, let's test these possible roots:\n\n1. f(1) = 1^3 + 2(1)^2 - 5(1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 5 - 6 = -8 (not a root)\n2. f(-1) = (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 5(-1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 5 - 6 = 0 (a root)\n\nSo, x = -1 is a root of the polynomial. Now we can use synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n        ________________________\n-1  |  1    2    -5    -6\n          -1    -1     6\n        ________________________\n         1    1    -6     0\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is x^2 + x - 6. Now, we can factor this quadratic:\n\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2)\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as (x + 1)(x + 3)(x - 2).\n\nThe solutions to the polynomial equation x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0 are x = -1, x = -3, and x = 2."
