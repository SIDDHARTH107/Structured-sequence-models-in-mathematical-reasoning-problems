    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. A group of order 60 has a prime factorization of 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5.\n3. The Sylow theorems can be used to analyze the structure of the group.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems:\n\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (of order 2^2 = 4) divides 3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. So, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups can be 1, 3, or 15.\n- The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (of order 3) divides 2^2 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. So, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups can be 1, 4, or 10.\n- The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (of order 5) divides 2^2 * 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. So, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups can be 1, 4, or 12.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the group based on these Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is a direct product of these subgroups and is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 60, Z_60.\n\n2. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, but 3 or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, then the group is a semidirect product of a normal Sylow 2-subgroup with the direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, there are two non-isomorphic groups: the dihedral group D_30 and the dicyclic group Q_30.\n\nSo, there are a total of 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 60: Z_60, D_30, and Q_30."
