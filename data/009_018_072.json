    "message_2": "To solve the given second-order nonlinear differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we first need to convert it into a system of first-order differential equations. Let's introduce two new variables:\n\nv = y'\nw = y''\n\nNow, we have the following system of first-order differential equations:\n\ny' = v\nv' = w\nw' = sin(x) - v^2 - y*sin(y)\n\nwith the initial conditions y(0) = 1, v(0) = 0.\n\nNow, we can apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of equations. Here's a Python code using the `scipy` library to solve the problem and plot the solution:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef system_of_equations(t, y):\n    y, v, w = y\n    dydt = v\n    dvdt = w\n    dwdt = np.sin(t) - v**2 - y*np.sin(y)\n    return [dydt, dvdt, dwdt]\n\n# Initial conditions\ny0 = [1, 0, 0]\n\n# Time interval\nt_span = (0, 10)\nt_eval = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)\n\n# Solve the system of equations using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method\nsol = solve_ivp(system_of_equations, t_span, y0, method='RK45', t_eval=t_eval)\n\n# Plot the solution\nplt.plot(sol.t, sol.y[0], label='y(x)')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y(x)')\nplt.title('Solution of the nonlinear differential equation')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will solve the given differential equation in the interval [0, 10] and plot the solution y(x). Note that the exact solution cannot be expressed in a closed form, so the numerical solution is the best we can do."
