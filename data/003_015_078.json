    "message_2": "To model the height of a rider on a Ferris wheel using a sine function, we need to determine the amplitude and the period of the function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude is half the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which represents the maximum height a rider can be above or below the center of the wheel. Since the diameter of the Ferris wheel is 100 feet, the amplitude is:\n\nAmplitude = (1/2) * Diameter = (1/2) * 100 feet = 50 feet\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of the sine function represents the time it takes for the Ferris wheel to complete one full revolution. In this case, the Ferris wheel makes one full revolution every 30 seconds, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = 30 seconds\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the sine function is 50 feet, and the period is 30 seconds. The sine function that models the height above ground level of a rider can be written as:\n\nh(t) = 50 * sin(B * t) + 50\n\nWhere h(t) is the height above ground level at time t, and B is the constant that determines the period of the function. To find B, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nSubstituting the given period:\n\n30 seconds = 2π / B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 2π / 30\n\nSo the sine function that models the height above ground level of a rider is:\n\nh(t) = 50 * sin((2π / 30) * t) + 50"
