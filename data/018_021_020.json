The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nB = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nIntersection of A and B: A ∩ B = {2, 4, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the elements in either A or B, but not in their intersection:\n\nAΔB = (A - (A ∩ B)) ∪ (B - (A ∩ B))\nAΔB = ({2, 4, 6, 8, 10} - {2, 4, 6}) ∪ ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {2, 4, 6})\nAΔB = {8, 10} ∪ {1, 3, 5}\nAΔB = {1, 3, 5, 8, 10}\n\nNow we need to find the intersection of AΔB and B:\n\n(AΔB) ∩ B = {1, 3, 5, 8, 10} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n(AΔB) ∩ B = {1, 3, 5}\n\nSo, (AΔB) ∩ B = {1, 3, 5}."
