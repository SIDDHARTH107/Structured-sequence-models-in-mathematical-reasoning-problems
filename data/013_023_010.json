    "message_1": "In a trust game, player 1 is given $100 and must decide how much to send to player 2. The amount sent is then tripled, and player 2 decides how much of the tripled amount to send back to player 1. If player 2 sends back $150, how much did player 1 send?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount player 1 sent to player 2. When this amount is tripled, it becomes 3x. Player 2 then sends back $150 to player 1.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n3x - 150 = x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x - x = 150\n2x = 150\nx = 75\n\nSo, player 1 sent $75 to player 2."
