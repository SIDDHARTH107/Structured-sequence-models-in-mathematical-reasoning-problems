    "message_1": "In how many ways can you distribute 10 identical objects into 3 distinct boxes, where each box has at least one object?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the stars and bars method. Since each box must have at least one object, we can place one object in each box first. Now we have 7 objects left to distribute among the 3 distinct boxes.\n\nWe can represent the 7 objects as 7 stars (*****) and we need to divide them into 3 groups (boxes). To do this, we can use 2 bars (|) to separate the stars into 3 groups.\n\nFor example, one possible distribution could be: **|***|** which represents 2 objects in the first box, 3 objects in the second box, and 2 objects in the third box.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the 7 stars and 2 bars. There are a total of 9 positions (7 stars + 2 bars), and we need to choose 2 positions for the bars.\n\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 9 and k = 2.\n\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9-2)!)\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2!7!)\nC(9, 2) = (9 × 8 × 7!)/(2 × 7!)\nC(9, 2) = (9 × 8)/2\nC(9, 2) = 36\n\nSo there are 36 ways to distribute 10 identical objects into 3 distinct boxes, where each box has at least one object."
