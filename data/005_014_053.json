    "message_1": "In a factor analysis of 100 students, 4 factors were identified that accounted for 60% of the variability in the data. If the first factor alone explains 25% of the total variability, what is the percentage of variability explained by the other three factors combined?",
    "message_2": "The first factor explains 25% of the total variability, and the four factors combined explain 60% of the total variability. To find the percentage of variability explained by the other three factors combined, we subtract the percentage explained by the first factor from the total percentage explained by all four factors:\n\n60% (total variability explained by all four factors) - 25% (variability explained by the first factor) = 35%\n\nSo, the other three factors combined explain 35% of the total variability."
