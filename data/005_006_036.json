    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the mean weight (μ) of all laptops is 2.5 kg and the standard deviation (σ) is 0.2 kg. We are given a sample size (n) of 100 laptops and we want to find the probability that their average weight (X̄) is less than 2.4 kg.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σX̄), which is given by the formula:\n\nσX̄ = σ / √n\n\nσX̄ = 0.2 / √100\nσX̄ = 0.2 / 10\nσX̄ = 0.02 kg\n\nNow, we will find the z-score, which is the number of standard deviations away from the mean. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (X̄ - μ) / σX̄\n\nz = (2.4 - 2.5) / 0.02\nz = -0.1 / 0.02\nz = -5\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability that the average weight is less than 2.4 kg. A z-score of -5 is quite far from the mean, and the probability for such a z-score is very close to 0. In fact, it's so close to 0 that it's essentially negligible.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the average weight of the 100 randomly chosen laptops is less than 2.4 kg is approximately 0."
