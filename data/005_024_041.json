    "message_2": "To find the mean (average) number of hours students studied per week, we will add up all the numbers and then divide by the total number of data points.\n\nMean = (5 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 3 + 5) / 10\nMean = 57 / 10\nMean = 5.7 hours\n\nTo find the median (middle value), we first need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8\n\nSince there are 10 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th values).\n\nMedian = (6 + 6) / 2\nMedian = 12 / 2\nMedian = 6 hours\n\nSo, the mean number of hours students studied per week is 5.7 hours, and the median is 6 hours."
