    "message_1": "Here is a possible precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Adverse Selection in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose there are two types of used cars that a buyer can choose from: high quality (H) and low quality (L). The buyer values the high quality cars at $7,000 and the low quality cars at $3,000. The seller knows the quality of the car, but the buyer does not. It costs the seller $5,000 to sell a high quality car and $3,000 to sell a low quality car. The seller can choose to sell only one type of car or both types. If the seller sells both types, the buyer's belief about the type of car he is buying is based on the proportion of each type of car he observes on the market. If the buyer believes he is buying a high quality car but it turns out to be low quality, he will only be willing to pay $2,000 for it. If the buyer believes he is buying a low quality car but it turns out to be high quality, he will be willing to pay $8,000 for it. What combination of prices for the two types of cars will the seller choose, assuming he wants to maximize his profit, and what will the buyer's belief be about the quality of the car he is buying in that case?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If the seller sells only high-quality cars (H), he can sell them at $7,000, and his profit per car will be $7,000 - $5,000 = $2,000. The buyer will always believe he is buying a high-quality car.\n\n2. If the seller sells only low-quality cars (L), he can sell them at $3,000, and his profit per car will be $3,000 - $3,000 = $0. The buyer will always believe he is buying a low-quality car.\n\n3. If the seller sells both types of cars, he needs to set prices for both types such that the buyer is willing to pay for each type. Let's denote the proportion of high-quality cars in the market as p and the proportion of low-quality cars as (1-p). The buyer's expected value for a car is given by:\n\nEV = p * $7,000 + (1-p) * $3,000\n\nIf the buyer believes he is buying a high-quality car but it turns out to be low quality, he will only be willing to pay $2,000 for it. So, the seller should set the price of low-quality cars at $2,000. His profit per low-quality car will be $2,000 - $3,000 = -$1,000, which means he will lose money on each low-quality car sold.\n\nIf the buyer believes he is buying a low-quality car but it turns out to be high quality, he will be willing to pay $8,000 for it. So, the seller should set the price of high-quality cars at $8,000. His profit per high-quality car will be $8,000 - $5,000 = $3,000.\n\nNow, the seller needs to find the optimal proportion of high-quality cars (p) to maximize his profit. The seller's total profit can be expressed as:\n\nTotal Profit = p * $3,000 + (1-p) * (-$1,000)\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we can take the derivative with respect to p and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Total Profit)/dp = $3,000 - $4,000 = -$1,000\n\nSince the derivative is negative, the seller should sell only high-quality cars to maximize his profit. In this case, the buyer will always believe he is buying a high-quality car.\n\nIn conclusion, the seller should choose to sell only high-quality cars at a price of $7,000, and the buyer's belief will be that he is always buying a high-quality car."
