    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function $H$:\n\n$$\nH(x, u, \\lambda, t) = L(x, u, t) + \\lambda f(x, u, t),\n$$\n\nwhere $L(x, u, t) = x^2 + u^2$ is the Lagrangian and $f(x, u, t) = 6x + 2u$ is the system dynamics. Then, the Hamiltonian is:\n\n$$\nH(x, u, \\lambda, t) = x^2 + u^2 + \\lambda (6x + 2u).\n$$\n\nAccording to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, we need to find the control input $u$ that minimizes the Hamiltonian. To do this, we take the partial derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to $u$ and set it to zero:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 2u + 2\\lambda = 0.\n$$\n\nSolving for $u$, we get:\n\n$$\nu = -\\lambda.\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equation by taking the partial derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = 2x + 6\\lambda.\n$$\n\nSince the costate equation is given by $\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = -2x - 6\\lambda.\n$$\n\nNow, we have a system of two differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 6x + 2u \\\\\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = -2x - 6\\lambda\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSubstitute $u = -\\lambda$ into the first equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 6x - 2\\lambda.\n$$\n\nNow, we have a system of two first-order linear differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 6x - 2\\lambda \\\\\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = -2x - 6\\lambda\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwith initial conditions $x(0) = 0$ and $x(1) = 2$. We can solve this system of equations using any standard method, such as the matrix exponential or Laplace transforms. The solution is:\n\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{1}{3}e^{6t} + \\frac{2}{3}e^{-6t} - \\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n\\lambda(t) = \\frac{1}{3}e^{6t} - \\frac{1}{3}e^{-6t}.\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the optimal control input $u$:\n\n$$\nu(t) = -\\lambda(t) = -\\frac{1}{3}e^{6t} + \\frac{1}{3}e^{-6t}.\n$$\n\nThus, the control input $u(t)$ that minimizes the cost function $J$ is:\n\n$$\nu(t) = -\\frac{1}{3}e^{6t} + \\frac{1}{3}e^{-6t}.\n$$"
