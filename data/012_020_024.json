    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of the graph G, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relations. In other words, we need to find all the vertex permutations that, when applied to the adjacency matrix, result in the same adjacency matrix.\n\nLet's label the vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6. We can start by observing the degrees of the vertices:\n\n- deg(v1) = 2\n- deg(v2) = 2\n- deg(v3) = 2\n- deg(v4) = 3\n- deg(v5) = 3\n- deg(v6) = 2\n\nFrom the degrees, we can see that v1, v2, v3, and v6 are of the same type (degree 2), while v4 and v5 are of another type (degree 3). This means that any automorphism must map vertices of the same type to each other.\n\nNow let's analyze the possible automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself, is always part of the automorphism group.\n\n2. We can swap v1 and v2, and at the same time swap v3 and v6. This gives us the permutation (1 2)(3 6).\n\n3. Similarly, we can swap v1 and v3, and at the same time swap v2 and v6. This gives us the permutation (1 3)(2 6).\n\n4. We can also swap v4 and v5, which gives us the permutation (4 5).\n\n5. Combining the permutations from points 2 and 4, we get the permutation (1 2)(3 6)(4 5).\n\n6. Combining the permutations from points 3 and 4, we get the permutation (1 3)(2 6)(4 5).\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms for the given graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is:\n\n{(), (1 2)(3 6), (1 3)(2 6), (4 5), (1 2)(3 6)(4 5), (1 3)(2 6)(4 5)}"
