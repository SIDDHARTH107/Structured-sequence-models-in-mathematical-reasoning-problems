    "message_2": "To find the area of a right triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nWe are given the base (10 cm) and the height (14 cm) of the right triangle. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10 cm * 14 cm\n\nArea = 5 cm * 14 cm\n\nArea = 70 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the right triangle is 70 square centimeters."
