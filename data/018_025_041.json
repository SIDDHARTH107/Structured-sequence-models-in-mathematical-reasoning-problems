The intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set of elements which are common to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA Δ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = ({2} ∪ {8}) = {2, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 6}\n\nTo show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection, we need to show that (A Δ B) ∩ A ≠ A ∩ (A Δ B).\n\nLet's find (A Δ B) ∩ A:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ A = {2, 8} ∩ {2, 4, 6} = {2}\n\nNow let's find A ∩ (A Δ B):\n\nA ∩ (A Δ B) = {2, 4, 6} ∩ {2, 8} = {2}\n\nSince (A Δ B) ∩ A = A ∩ (A Δ B) = {2}, the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection."
