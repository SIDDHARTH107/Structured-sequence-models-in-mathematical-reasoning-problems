    "message_2": "To find the intersection, union, and relative complement of sets A and B, we will perform the following operations:\n\n1. Intersection (A ∩ B): The intersection of sets A and B consists of all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, A ∩ B = {3, 5}.\n\n2. Union (A ∪ B): The union of sets A and B consists of all elements that are in either set A or set B. In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}.\n\n3. Relative Complement:\n   a. A - B (Elements in A but not in B): This consists of all elements that are in set A but not in set B. In this case, A - B = {1, 7}.\n   b. B - A (Elements in B but not in A): This consists of all elements that are in set B but not in set A. In this case, B - A = {2, 8}.\n\nSo, the intersection is {3, 5}, the union is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}, and the relative complements are {1, 7} for A - B and {2, 8} for B - A."
