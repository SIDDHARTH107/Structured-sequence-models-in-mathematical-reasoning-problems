    "message_2": "The train starts at 10:00 AM and reaches station B at 1:30 PM. To find the time duration of the journey, we need to subtract the starting time from the arrival time.\n\nStarting time: 10:00 AM\nArrival time: 1:30 PM\n\nFirst, we need to convert the times to a 24-hour format:\nStarting time: 10:00 (10:00 AM)\nArrival time: 13:30 (1:30 PM)\n\nNow, subtract the starting time from the arrival time:\n\nHours: 13 - 10 = 3 hours\nMinutes: 30 - 0 = 30 minutes\n\nSo, the time duration of the train journey is 3 hours and 30 minutes."
