    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Stirling numbers of the second kind. Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 10 elements and k = 3 subsets. So, we need to find S(10, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(10, 3), we need to know the values of S(9, 3), S(9, 2), S(8, 3), and S(8, 2). We can continue breaking down the formula until we reach the base cases:\n\nS(n, 1) = 1 for all n (partitioning n elements into 1 subset)\nS(n, n) = 1 for all n (partitioning n elements into n single-element subsets)\nS(n, k) = 0 for k > n\n\nUsing the base cases and the formula, we can compute the required Stirling numbers:\n\nS(8, 2) = 7 * S(7, 2) + S(7, 1) = 7 * 21 + 1 = 148\nS(8, 3) = 3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2) = 3 * 35 + 21 = 126\nS(9, 2) = 8 * S(8, 2) + S(8, 1) = 8 * 148 + 1 = 1185\nS(9, 3) = 3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2) = 3 * 126 + 148 = 526\n\nNow we can find S(10, 3):\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * S(9, 3) + S(9, 2) = 3 * 526 + 1185 = 2763\n\nSo, there are 2763 ways to partition a set of 10 distinct integers into 3 non-empty disjoint subsets."
