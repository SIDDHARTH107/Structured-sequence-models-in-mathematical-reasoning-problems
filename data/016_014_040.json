    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a type of fractal that is constructed through a series of iterations. In each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of √2. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the curve is 1 * √2.\nAfter the second iteration, the length of the curve is (√2) * √2 = 2.\nAfter the third iteration, the length of the curve is 2 * √2.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of the curve is (2√2) * √2 = 4.\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after the fourth iteration, starting with a line segment of length 1, is 4."
