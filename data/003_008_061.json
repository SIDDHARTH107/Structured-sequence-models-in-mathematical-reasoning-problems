    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we need to find the angle between the base and the height. To do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then use the inverse sine function to find the angle.\n\nLet's call the angle between the base and the height \"A\". The opposite side to angle A is the height (7 cm), and the adjacent side is the base (12 cm). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse:\n\nhypotenuse^2 = base^2 + height^2\nhypotenuse^2 = 12^2 + 7^2\nhypotenuse^2 = 144 + 49\nhypotenuse^2 = 193\nhypotenuse = √193\n\nNow we can use the inverse sine function to find the angle A:\n\nsin(A) = opposite / hypotenuse\nsin(A) = 7 / √193\n\nA = arcsin(7 / √193)\n\nNow we can use the area formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 7 * sin(A)\nArea = 6 * 7 * sin(arcsin(7 / √193))\nArea = 42 * (7 / √193)\nArea = 294 / √193\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 21.07 square centimeters."
