    "message_1": "In a beauty contest game, three contestants are asked to guess a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the one whose guess is closest to 2/3 of the average of all guesses. If the guesses are recorded as 60, 80, and 90, respectively, what is the winning guess?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the average of the three guesses:\n\n(60 + 80 + 90) / 3 = 230 / 3 = 76.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we need to find 2/3 of the average:\n\n(2/3) * 76.67 = 51.11 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we need to find which guess is closest to 51.11:\n\n|60 - 51.11| = 8.89\n|80 - 51.11| = 28.89\n|90 - 51.11| = 38.89\n\nThe smallest difference is 8.89, which corresponds to the guess of 60. Therefore, the winning guess is 60."
