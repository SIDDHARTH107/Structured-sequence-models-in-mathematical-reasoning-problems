    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using the inverse matrix method, we first need to represent the system in the form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2 -1  3 |\n    | 3  2 -2 |\n    | 4  1  1 |\n    | 5 -3  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 4 |\n    | 1 |\n    | 3 |\n    | 7 |\n    | 6 |\n\nHowever, the inverse matrix method can only be applied to square matrices, and the given system has a 5x3 matrix. Therefore, we cannot use the inverse matrix method to solve this system of linear equations. Instead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination, Gauss-Jordan elimination, or the least squares method."
