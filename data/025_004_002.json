    "message_2": "To find the tangent line to the curve at the point where $t=1$, we first need to find the coordinates of the point and the slope of the tangent line.\n\n1. Find the coordinates of the point:\nPlug in $t=1$ into the parametric equations for $x$ and $y$.\n\n$x(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$\n$y(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0$\n\nSo the point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n2. Find the slope of the tangent line:\nTo find the slope, we need to find the derivatives of $x$ and $y$ with respect to $t$.\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2t - 2$\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = 3t^2 - 3$\n\nNow, plug in $t=1$ to find the slope at the point $(0, 0)$.\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt}(1) = 2(1) - 2 = 0$\n$\\frac{dy}{dt}(1) = 3(1)^2 - 3 = 0$\n\nSince $\\frac{dx}{dt}(1) = 0$, the tangent line is vertical. The equation of a vertical line passing through the point $(0, 0)$ is simply $x = 0$. Therefore, the tangent line to the curve at the point where $t=1$ is $x = 0$."
