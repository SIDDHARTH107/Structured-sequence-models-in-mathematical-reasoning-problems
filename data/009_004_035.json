    "message_2": "a) To write the differential equation that models the motion of the mass-spring system, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. Newton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass times its acceleration:\n\nF = ma\n\nwhere m is the mass and a is the acceleration. Since acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, we can write:\n\nma = m(d^2x/dt^2)\n\nCombining these two equations, we get the differential equation:\n\nm(d^2x/dt^2) = -kx\n\nFor our given values, m = 2 kg and k = 12 N/m, so the differential equation is:\n\n2(d^2x/dt^2) = -12x\n\nb) To find the amplitude, natural frequency, and the period of the resulting vibrations, we first need to find the angular frequency (ω). We can find this by rearranging the differential equation:\n\nω^2 = k/m\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nω^2 = 12/2 = 6\n\nω = sqrt(6) rad/s\n\nThe natural frequency (f) is related to the angular frequency by:\n\nf = ω/(2π)\n\nf = sqrt(6)/(2π) Hz\n\nThe period (T) is the reciprocal of the natural frequency:\n\nT = 1/f = 2π/sqrt(6) s\n\nThe amplitude (A) can be found using the initial conditions. The mass is initially displaced 8 cm (0.08 m) from its equilibrium position:\n\nA = 0.08 m\n\nc) To find the displacement and velocity functions of the mass-spring system, we can use the general solution for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, t is time, and φ is the phase angle. To find the phase angle, we can use the initial conditions. At t = 0, x(0) = 0.08 m:\n\n0.08 = A*cos(φ)\n\nSince A = 0.08 m, cos(φ) = 1, and φ = 0.\n\nThe displacement function is:\n\nx(t) = 0.08*cos(sqrt(6)*t)\n\nTo find the velocity function, we can take the derivative of the displacement function with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = -0.08*sqrt(6)*sin(sqrt(6)*t)\n\nUsing the initial condition of the velocity (v(0) = 5 m/s):\n\n5 = -0.08*sqrt(6)*sin(0)\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, this initial condition is not consistent with the displacement function we found. Therefore, we need to reconsider the general solution for the mass-spring system, which can also be written as:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = -A*ω*sin(ωt) + B*ω*cos(ωt)\n\nUsing the initial conditions x(0) = 0.08 m and v(0) = 5 m/s:\n\n0.08 = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) => A = 0.08\n\n5 = -0.08*sqrt(6)*sin(0) + B*sqrt(6)*cos(0) => B = 5/sqrt(6)\n\nNow, the displacement and velocity functions are:\n\nx(t) = 0.08*cos(sqrt(6)*t) + (5/sqrt(6))*sin(sqrt(6)*t)\n\nv(t) = -0.08*sqrt(6)*sin(sqrt(6)*t) + 5*cos(sqrt(6)*t)\n\nd) To find the time when the mass passes its equilibrium position for the first time, we need to find when x(t) = 0:\n\n0 = 0.08*cos(sqrt(6)*t) + (5/sqrt(6))*sin(sqrt(6)*t)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.08:\n\n0 = cos(sqrt(6)*t) + (5/0.08)*sin(sqrt(6)*t)/sqrt(6)\n\n0 = cos(sqrt(6)*t) + (50/sqrt(6))*sin(sqrt(6)*t)\n\nSince the mass is initially moving towards the equilibrium position, it will pass through the equilibrium position when sin(sqrt(6)*t) is positive and cos(sqrt(6)*t) is negative. This occurs in the second quadrant, where t is between π/2 and π:\n\nπ/2 < sqrt(6)*t < π\n\nDivide by sqrt(6):\n\n(π/2)/sqrt(6) < t < π/sqrt(6)\n\nNumerically, this gives:\n\n0.64 s < t < 1.28 s\n\nThe mass passes its equilibrium position for the first time between 0.64 s and 1.28 s."
