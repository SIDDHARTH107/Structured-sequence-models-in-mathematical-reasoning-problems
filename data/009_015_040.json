    "message_1": "A radioactive substance has a half-life of 24 hours. If it initially has 200 grams, how much will be left after 3 days?",
    "message_2": "To find out how much of the radioactive substance will be left after 3 days, we need to determine how many half-lives have passed and then apply the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^number of half-lives\n\nSince the half-life is 24 hours and there are 72 hours in 3 days, there are 72/24 = 3 half-lives.\n\nNow we can apply the formula:\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/2)^3\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/8)\nFinal amount = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 3 days, there will be 25 grams of the radioactive substance left."
