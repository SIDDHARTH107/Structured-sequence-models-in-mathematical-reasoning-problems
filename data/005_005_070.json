    "message_1": "Suppose the weights of a certain type of fruit follow a normal distribution with a mean of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 10 grams. What is the probability that a randomly selected fruit from this distribution weighs between 135 and 165 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected fruit weighs between 135 and 165 grams, we need to calculate the z-scores for these weights and then find the area under the normal distribution curve between these z-scores.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the weight, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor 135 grams:\nz1 = (135 - 150) / 10 = -1.5\n\nFor 165 grams:\nz2 = (165 - 150) / 10 = 1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between z1 and z2. We can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(z1) = P(-1.5) ≈ 0.0668\nP(z2) = P(1.5) ≈ 0.9332\n\nThe probability of a fruit weighing between 135 and 165 grams is the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(135 < X < 165) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.9332 - 0.0668 = 0.8664\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected fruit weighs between 135 and 165 grams is approximately 86.64%."
