    "message_2": "To find the mean production rate for the week, we need to add up all the production rates and then divide by the number of days in the week.\n\nMean production rate = (105 + 110 + 120 + 98 + 103 + 100 + 108) / 7\n\nMean production rate = 744 / 7\n\nMean production rate = 106\n\nThe mean production rate for the week is 106 ball bearings per hour."
