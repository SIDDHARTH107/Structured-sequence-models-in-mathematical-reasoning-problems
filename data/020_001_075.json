    "message_1": "A catering company offers two types of meals: A and B. Each meal of type A requires 2 units of chicken, 3 units of rice, and 1 unit of sauce. Each meal of type B requires 1 unit of chicken, 3 units of rice, and 2 units of sauce. The catering company has 150 units of chicken, 300 units of rice, and 90 units of sauce on hand. Each meal of type A earns a profit of $7, and each meal of type B earns a profit of $5. What is the maximum profit that the catering company can earn given the available resources?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of meals of type A and y be the number of meals of type B. The constraints for the available resources can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n2x + y ≤ 150 (chicken constraint)\n3x + 3y ≤ 300 (rice constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 90 (sauce constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 7x + 5y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the rice constraint by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx + y ≤ 100\n\nNow we have three inequalities:\n\n2x + y ≤ 150\nx + y ≤ 100\nx + 2y ≤ 90\n\nWe can find the intersection points of these inequalities to determine the feasible region:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2): x = 50, y = 50\nIntersection of (1) and (3): x = 30, y = 60\nIntersection of (2) and (3): x = 20, y = 80\n\nNow we evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these intersection points:\n\nP(50, 50) = 7(50) + 5(50) = 350 + 250 = 600\nP(30, 60) = 7(30) + 5(60) = 210 + 300 = 510\nP(20, 80) = 7(20) + 5(80) = 140 + 400 = 540\n\nThe maximum profit of $600 is achieved when the catering company prepares 50 meals of type A and 50 meals of type B."
