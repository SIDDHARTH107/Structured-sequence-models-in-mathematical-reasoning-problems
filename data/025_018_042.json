    "message_1": "Let X be a projective algebraic variety over the field of complex numbers, and let L be an ample line bundle on X. If f: X->Y is a surjective projective morphism with connected fibers from X onto a projective algebraic variety Y, and if D is an effective divisor on X, then prove that there exists a positive integer m such that f_*((L^m)*(D)) is generated by global sections, where f_* denotes the pushforward of sheaves. \n\nFind the smallest positive integer m such that f_*((L^m)*(D)) is generated by global sections.",
    "message_2": "To prove the existence of such an integer m, we will use the following facts:\n\nFact 1: If L is an ample line bundle on X, then for any coherent sheaf F on X, there exists an integer n such that L^n ⊗ F is generated by global sections.\n\nFact 2: For any coherent sheaf F on X and any projective morphism f: X -> Y, the higher direct images R^i f_*(F) vanish for i > 0.\n\nNow, let F = O_X(D), the sheaf associated to the effective divisor D. By Fact 1, there exists an integer n such that L^n ⊗ F is generated by global sections. Let G = L^n ⊗ F = L^n ⊗ O_X(D). Then, we have f_*(G) = f_*(L^n ⊗ O_X(D)).\n\nBy Fact 2, the higher direct images R^i f_*(G) vanish for i > 0. Therefore, we have an exact sequence:\n\n0 -> f_*(G) -> H^0(X, G) -> H^0(Y, R^1 f_*(G)) -> 0\n\nSince R^1 f_*(G) = 0, we have f_*(G) ≅ H^0(X, G). This implies that f_*(L^n ⊗ O_X(D)) is generated by global sections.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer m such that f_*((L^m)*(D)) is generated by global sections. We can use the following argument:\n\nSince L is ample, there exists a positive integer m' such that L^m' is very ample. Then, for any m ≥ m', L^m is also very ample. By Fact 1, there exists an integer n' such that L^n' ⊗ F is generated by global sections. Let m = max(m', n'). Then, L^m is very ample, and L^m ⊗ F is generated by global sections.\n\nHence, the smallest positive integer m such that f_*((L^m)*(D)) is generated by global sections is given by m = max(m', n'), where m' and n' are the integers obtained from the ampleness of L and the generation of global sections, respectively."
