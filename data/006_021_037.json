    "message_2": "To find the expected number of households affected by the flood, we can multiply the probability of a flood occurring by the total number of households in the region.\n\nExpected number of households affected = Probability of flood * Total number of households\nExpected number of households affected = 0.06 * 5000\nExpected number of households affected = 300\n\nSo, the expected number of households that will be affected by the flood is 300."
