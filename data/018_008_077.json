    "message_2": "A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Similarly, B × A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A.\n\nLet's calculate A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, A × B and B × A are not equal, since the ordered pairs in each set are different. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
