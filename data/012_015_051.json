    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 5 vertices and 7 edges. Is G connected or disconnected? If connected, how many connected components does it have?",
    "message_2": "A graph G with 5 vertices can have at most (5 * (5 - 1)) / 2 = 10 edges if it is a complete graph. Since G has 7 edges, it is not a complete graph, but it can still be connected.\n\nTo determine if G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n - 1 edges. In this case, n = 5, so a connected graph must have at least 5 - 1 = 4 edges. Since G has 7 edges, which is more than the minimum required, it is possible for G to be connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of connected components in G. If G is connected, it has only one connected component, which includes all 5 vertices. If G is disconnected, it would have more than one connected component. However, since G has more than the minimum required edges for a connected graph, it is likely that G is connected.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that G is connected and has only one connected component."
