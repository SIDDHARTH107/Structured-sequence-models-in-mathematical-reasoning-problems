    "message_2": "To prove that B is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in B is also an element in A.\n\nThe set A contains the odd prime numbers less than 10, which are {3, 5, 7}.\n\nThe set B is an empty set, which means it contains no elements. By definition, an empty set is a subset of any set, including A, because there are no elements in B that are not in A.\n\nTherefore, B is a subset of A."
