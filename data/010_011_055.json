    "message_2": "Let's denote the north pole as point A and the south pole as point B. We are looking for smooth, non-intersecting paths from A to B that pass through exactly three distinct points on the sphere. \n\nSince the path must be smooth, we can consider each path as a great circle (a circle with the same radius as the sphere and whose center is at the center of the sphere). Each great circle divides the sphere into two equal hemispheres. \n\nNow, let's choose the first point on the path, which we will call point C. There are infinitely many choices for point C since it can be any point on the sphere except for points A and B. Once we choose point C, the great circle determined by points A, B, and C is fixed. \n\nNext, we need to choose the second point on the path, which we will call point D. Point D must be on the great circle determined by points A, B, and C, but it cannot be any of the points A, B, or C. There are still infinitely many choices for point D.\n\nFinally, we need to choose the third point on the path, which we will call point E. Point E must also be on the great circle determined by points A, B, and C, but it cannot be any of the points A, B, C, or D. There are still infinitely many choices for point E.\n\nSince there are infinitely many choices for points C, D, and E, there are infinitely many smooth, non-intersecting paths from the north pole to the south pole that pass through exactly three distinct points on the sphere."
