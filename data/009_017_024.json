    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a point located 2 meters from the wire and perpendicular to it, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB produced by a small segment of wire carrying current I at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), dl is the vector representing the small segment of wire, r is the vector from the wire segment to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire is straight and the point P is perpendicular to the wire, we can simplify the Biot-Savart Law for this case:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2π * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, I is the current, and R is the distance from the wire to the point P.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we have:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 2 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10⁻⁷ T) / (4π)\n\nB = 5 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a point located 2 meters from the wire and perpendicular to it is 5 × 10⁻⁷ T (Tesla)."
