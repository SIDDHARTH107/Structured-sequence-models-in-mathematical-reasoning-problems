    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative polynomial ring $R=\\mathbb{C}\\langle x, y\\rangle/(yx-xy-1)$ and its quotient field $K=\\text{frac}(R)$. Let $M_R=\\text{span}_{\\mathbb{C}}\\{1,x,y,x^2,xy,yx,y^2,\\ldots \\}$ be the free left $R$-module with the usual multiplication. \n\nFind the dimension over $K$ of the vector space $M_R\\otimes_RK$.",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension over $K$ of the vector space $M_R \\otimes_R K$, we first need to understand the structure of the tensor product. Since $M_R$ is a free left $R$-module, we can write any element of $M_R \\otimes_R K$ as a finite sum of simple tensors of the form $m \\otimes k$, where $m \\in M_R$ and $k \\in K$. \n\nNow, we can use the relation $yx - xy - 1 = 0$ in $R$ to simplify the tensor product. For any $m \\in M_R$ and $k \\in K$, we have\n$$m(yx - xy - 1) \\otimes k = myx \\otimes k - mxy \\otimes k - m \\otimes k = 0.$$\n\nUsing this relation, we can rewrite any simple tensor with $yx$ or $xy$ as a linear combination of simpler tensors. For example, if we have a simple tensor $m \\otimes (yx)$, we can rewrite it as\n$$m \\otimes (yx) = m \\otimes (xy + 1) = mxy \\otimes 1 + m \\otimes 1.$$\n\nSimilarly, if we have a simple tensor $m \\otimes (xy)$, we can rewrite it as\n$$m \\otimes (xy) = m \\otimes (yx - 1) = myx \\otimes 1 - m \\otimes 1.$$\n\nUsing these relations, we can rewrite any element of $M_R \\otimes_R K$ as a linear combination of simple tensors of the form $m \\otimes 1$, where $m \\in M_R$. Therefore, the set $\\{m \\otimes 1 \\mid m \\in M_R\\}$ forms a basis for $M_R \\otimes_R K$.\n\nSince $M_R$ is spanned by the set $\\{1, x, y, x^2, xy, yx, y^2, \\ldots\\}$, the dimension of $M_R \\otimes_R K$ over $K$ is equal to the cardinality of this set. However, this set is countably infinite, so the dimension of $M_R \\otimes_R K$ over $K$ is countably infinite."
