    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the global minimum of a function. It is particularly useful for solving complex combinatorial problems. In this case, we will use tabu search to find the minimum value of the function f(x, y) = -(sin(x) + cos(y)) on the interval x ∈ [0, 5] and y ∈ [0, 5].\n\nHere's an outline of the tabu search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the search parameters:\n   - Tenure (T): The number of iterations a solution is considered \"tabu\" (forbidden). We'll set T = 5.\n   - Aspiration criteria (A): A value that, if reached, overrides the tabu status of a solution. We'll set A = -2, as it is a reasonable lower bound for our function.\n   - Neighborhood size (N): The number of neighboring solutions to consider in each iteration. We'll set N = 10.\n   - Maximum number of iterations (M): The maximum number of iterations to perform. We'll set M = 100.\n\n2. Generate an initial solution (x0, y0) randomly within the given intervals.\n\n3. Set the current solution (xc, yc) to the initial solution (x0, y0).\n\n4. Create an empty tabu list.\n\n5. For each iteration i = 1 to M:\n   a. Generate N neighboring solutions of (xc, yc) within the given intervals.\n   b. Evaluate the objective function f(x, y) for each neighboring solution.\n   c. Select the best solution (xb, yb) among the neighbors that is not in the tabu list or satisfies the aspiration criteria.\n   d. Update the current solution (xc, yc) to the best solution (xb, yb).\n   e. Add the previous current solution to the tabu list.\n   f. Remove the oldest solution from the tabu list if its size exceeds the tenure T.\n\n6. The final current solution (xc, yc) is the optimal solution.\n\nNow, let's apply the tabu search algorithm to our problem:\n\n1. Initialize the search parameters:\n   - Tenure (T) = 5\n   - Aspiration criteria (A) = -2\n   - Neighborhood size (N) = 10\n   - Maximum number of iterations (M) = 100\n\n2. Generate an initial solution (x0, y0) randomly within the given intervals, e.g., (x0, y0) = (2.5, 2.5).\n\n3. Set the current solution (xc, yc) to the initial solution (x0, y0).\n\n4. Create an empty tabu list.\n\n5. For each iteration i = 1 to M:\n   a. Generate N neighboring solutions of (xc, yc) within the given intervals.\n   b. Evaluate the objective function f(x, y) for each neighboring solution.\n   c. Select the best solution (xb, yb) among the neighbors that is not in the tabu list or satisfies the aspiration criteria.\n   d. Update the current solution (xc, yc) to the best solution (xb, yb).\n   e. Add the previous current solution to the tabu list.\n   f. Remove the oldest solution from the tabu list if its size exceeds the tenure T.\n\n6. The final current solution (xc, yc) is the optimal solution.\n\nAfter running the tabu search algorithm, we would obtain the minimum value of the function f(x, y) and the corresponding values of x and y. Note that the actual solution may vary depending on the random initial solution and the neighborhood generation. However, the tabu search algorithm should provide a good approximation of the global minimum for this problem."
