    "message_2": "To find the mean number of data points per cluster, you need to add the number of data points in each cluster and then divide by the total number of clusters.\n\nMean = (Cluster 1 + Cluster 2 + Cluster 3 + Cluster 4 + Cluster 5) / Total number of clusters\n\nMean = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 20) / 5\n\nMean = (65) / 5\n\nMean = 13\n\nSo, the mean number of data points per cluster is 13."
