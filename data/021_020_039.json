    "message_1": "A company needs to plan production for two products A and B. Each unit of A requires 2 hours of processing time, while each unit of B requires 3 hours. The company has 200 hours of processing time available per week. Let the profit per unit of A be $50 and that of B be $80. The company wants to maximize profit. How many units of A and B should be produced each week using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, we need to first define the objective function and constraints. The objective function is the total profit, which we want to maximize. The constraints are the processing time available for each product.\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 50A + 80B\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2A + 3B <= 200 (processing time constraint)\n2. A >= 0\n3. B >= 0\n\nNow, let's implement the ABC algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Perform the employed bee phase: Generate new solutions by modifying the current solutions and evaluate their fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the old one.\n4. Perform the onlooker bee phase: Select the best solutions based on their fitness and generate new solutions by modifying them. If the new solution is better, replace the old one.\n5. Perform the scout bee phase: If a solution does not improve for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new random solution.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm, we will obtain the optimal number of units of A and B to produce each week that maximizes the profit while satisfying the constraints. The exact values of A and B will depend on the random initialization and the parameters of the algorithm, but the solution should be close to the optimal solution obtained using linear programming methods."
