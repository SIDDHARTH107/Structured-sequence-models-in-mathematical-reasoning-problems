    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 7 vertices. If the vertices can be colored with 3 different colors (red, blue, and green) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, how many distinct colorings are possible?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the chromatic polynomial. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a graph G is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph. In this case, we are looking for P(G, 3) for a graph with 7 vertices.\n\nHowever, without knowing the structure of the graph (i.e., how the vertices are connected), we cannot determine the exact chromatic polynomial. The number of distinct colorings will depend on the specific connections between the vertices.\n\nFor example, if the graph is a 7-cycle (a cycle with 7 vertices), then the chromatic polynomial is P(G, k) = (k-1)^7 - (k-1). In this case, P(G, 3) = (3-1)^7 - (3-1) = 2^7 - 2 = 128 - 2 = 126 distinct colorings.\n\nOn the other hand, if the graph is a tree with 7 vertices, the chromatic polynomial is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, P(G, 3) = 3(3-1)^(7-1) = 3(2)^6 = 3(64) = 192 distinct colorings.\n\nSo, without more information about the structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact number of distinct colorings."
