    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Stirling numbers of the second kind, we need to find the number of ways to partition a set of 10 identical items (pencils) into 4 non-empty distinguishable subsets (students). Stirling numbers of the second kind are denoted by S(n, k), where n is the number of items and k is the number of subsets.\n\nIn this case, we want to find S(10, 4). However, since each student must receive at least one pencil, we can think of this problem as distributing 6 pencils among 4 students, as 4 pencils are already given to each student. So, we need to find S(6, 4).\n\nUsing the recurrence relation for Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can compute S(6, 4) as follows:\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3)\nS(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3)\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\n\nNow, we need to compute the base cases:\n\nS(4, 4) = 1 (since there's only one way to partition 4 items into 4 subsets)\nS(4, 3) = 6 (since there are 6 ways to partition 4 items into 3 subsets)\nS(4, 2) = 7 (since there are 7 ways to partition 4 items into 2 subsets)\n\nNow, we can compute the Stirling numbers we need:\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 4) = 4 * 1 + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10\nS(6, 4) = 4 * 10 + 25 = 40 + 25 = 65\n\nSo, there are 65 ways to distribute the 10 identical pencils among the 4 distinguishable students, ensuring that each student receives at least one pencil."
