    "message_2": "The third Feigenbaum constant is not a well-defined concept in mathematics. There are only two Feigenbaum constants, which are related to bifurcation theory in dynamical systems. The first Feigenbaum constant (δ) is approximately 4.6692, and the second Feigenbaum constant (α) is approximately 2.5029. There is no third Feigenbaum constant."
