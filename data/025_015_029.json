    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1,1,-2), we first need to find the gradient of the function f(x,y,z) at that point. The gradient is given by the vector of partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of f(x,y,z):\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x - 4y - 4z\n∂f/∂y = 2y - 4x - 2z\n∂f/∂z = 2z - 2y - 4x\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1,1,-2):\n\n∂f/∂x(1,1,-2) = 2(1) - 4(1) - 4(-2) = 2 - 4 + 8 = 6\n∂f/∂y(1,1,-2) = 2(1) - 4(1) - 2(-2) = 2 - 4 + 4 = 2\n∂f/∂z(1,1,-2) = 2(-2) - 2(1) - 4(1) = -4 - 2 - 4 = -10\n\nSo, the gradient of f at the point (1,1,-2) is given by the vector (6, 2, -10).\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the tangent plane using the gradient and the point (1,1,-2):\n\n6(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) - 10(z + 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6x + 2y - 10z = 6 + 2 + 20\n\n6x + 2y - 10z = 28\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1,1,-2)."
