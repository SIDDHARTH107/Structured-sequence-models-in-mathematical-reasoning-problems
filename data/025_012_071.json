    "message_2": "An elliptic curve is defined by the equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B\n\nWe are given that the curve passes through the points (2, 3) and (-1, 1). We can use these points to form a system of equations:\n\n(1) 3^2 = 2^3 + 2A + B\n(2) 1^2 = (-1)^3 - A + B\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n(1) 9 = 8 + 2A + B\n(2) 1 = -1 - A + B\n\nFrom (1), we have B = 1 - 2A. Substituting this into (2), we get:\n\n1 = -1 - A + (1 - 2A)\n2A = A - 2\nA = -2\n\nNow, substituting A back into the equation for B, we get:\n\nB = 1 - 2(-2)\nB = 5\n\nSo, the equation of the elliptic curve is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 2x + 5\n\nNow, we need to check if the discriminant of this curve is -43. The discriminant of an elliptic curve is given by the formula:\n\nΔ = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)\n\nPlugging in the values of A and B, we get:\n\nΔ = -16(4(-2)^3 + 27(5)^2)\nΔ = -16(-32 + 675)\nΔ = -16(643)\nΔ = -10288\n\nSince the discriminant is not -43, the given information is inconsistent, and there is no elliptic curve with the given properties."
