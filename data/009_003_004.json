    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1 meter is heated on one end to 100°C and the other end is maintained at 0°C. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is 9.7 x 10^(-5) m^2/s. Use the one-dimensional heat diffusion equation to find the temperature at a point 0.25 meters from the heated end after 10 minutes of heating.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = T0 + ∑(2T1 / nπ) * sin(nπx / L) * exp(-(nπ)^2 * α * t / L^2)\n\nwhere:\nT(x, t) is the temperature at a point x meters from the heated end after time t,\nT0 is the initial temperature at the cold end (0°C),\nT1 is the temperature difference between the heated and cold ends (100°C),\nn is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...),\nL is the length of the rod (1 meter),\nα is the thermal diffusivity of the metal (9.7 x 10^(-5) m^2/s), and\nexp is the exponential function.\n\nWe want to find the temperature at x = 0.25 meters after t = 10 minutes (600 seconds) of heating. To get an accurate result, we will sum the first 100 terms of the series (n = 1 to 100).\n\nT(0.25, 600) = 0 + ∑(2 * 100 / nπ) * sin(nπ * 0.25) * exp(-(nπ)^2 * 9.7 x 10^(-5) * 600)\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum:\n\nT(0.25, 600) ≈ 0 + ∑(200 / nπ) * sin(nπ * 0.25) * exp(-(nπ)^2 * 9.7 x 10^(-5) * 600) for n = 1 to 100\n\nT(0.25, 600) ≈ 0 + 200 * ∑(1 / nπ) * sin(nπ * 0.25) * exp(-(nπ)^2 * 9.7 x 10^(-5) * 600) for n = 1 to 100\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nT(0.25, 600) ≈ 52.3°C\n\nSo, the temperature at a point 0.25 meters from the heated end after 10 minutes of heating is approximately 52.3°C."
