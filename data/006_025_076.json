    "message_1": "In a circus, there are 14 performers. Of these, 9 are acrobats and 5 are clowns. If the organizers randomly choose 3 performers to perform an act, what is the probability that all 3 performers are acrobats?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability, we will use the formula for combinations and the concept of probability.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 3 performers out of 14. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of performers (14 in this case) and k is the number of performers we want to choose (3 in this case).\n\nC(14, 3) = 14! / (3!(14-3)!)\nC(14, 3) = 14! / (3! * 11!)\nC(14, 3) = (14 * 13 * 12) / (3 * 2 * 1)\nC(14, 3) = 364\n\nSo, there are 364 ways to choose 3 performers out of 14.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 acrobats out of 9. Using the same combination formula:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!)\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * 6!)\nC(9, 3) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1)\nC(9, 3) = 84\n\nSo, there are 84 ways to choose 3 acrobats out of 9.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of choosing 3 acrobats by dividing the number of ways to choose 3 acrobats by the total number of ways to choose 3 performers:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 3 acrobats) / (Total number of ways to choose 3 performers)\nProbability = 84 / 364\nProbability = 21 / 91\n\nSo, the probability of choosing 3 acrobats is 21/91 or approximately 0.2308 (rounded to four decimal places)."
