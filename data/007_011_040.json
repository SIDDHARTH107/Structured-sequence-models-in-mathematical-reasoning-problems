    "message_2": "Let p be a prime number such that p ≡ 1 (mod 4). We want to find all quadratic residues modulo p.\n\nRecall that a number a is a quadratic residue modulo p if there exists an integer x such that a ≡ x^2 (mod p). \n\nFirst, we note that 1 is a quadratic residue modulo p since 1 ≡ 1^2 (mod p). Now, let's consider the numbers 2, 3, ..., (p-1). We can pair these numbers as follows:\n\n2, p-2\n3, p-3\n...\n(p-1)/2, (p+1)/2\n\nNotice that the product of each pair is congruent to -1 modulo p. That is,\n\n2*(p-2) ≡ -1 (mod p)\n3*(p-3) ≡ -1 (mod p)\n...\n((p-1)/2)*((p+1)/2) ≡ -1 (mod p)\n\nNow, we use the fact that p ≡ 1 (mod 4). Since p is odd, we can write p = 4k + 1 for some integer k. Then, we have:\n\n(p-1)/2 = (4k)/2 = 2k\n(p+1)/2 = (4k+2)/2 = 2k+1\n\nSo, the last pair is (2k, 2k+1), and their product is 4k^2 + 2k ≡ -1 (mod p).\n\nNow, we use the fact that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p since p ≡ 1 (mod 4). This means there exists an integer y such that -1 ≡ y^2 (mod p). Then, for each of the pairs above, we have:\n\na ≡ x^2 (mod p)\np-a ≡ (y*x)^2 (mod p)\n\nSo, for each a in the pairs, either a or p-a is a quadratic residue modulo p. Since there are (p-1)/2 pairs, we have a total of (p-1)/2 + 1 = (p+1)/2 quadratic residues modulo p, including 1.\n\nIn summary, there are (p+1)/2 quadratic residues modulo p, and they can be found by checking each number in the pairs and determining whether it or its complement modulo p is a quadratic residue."
