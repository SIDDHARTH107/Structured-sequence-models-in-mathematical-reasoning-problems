    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost to connect all the cities using the minimum spanning tree algorithm, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. Here, we will use Kruskal's algorithm.\n\nFirst, sort all the edges in ascending order of their weights:\n\n1. A-B (1)\n2. B-C (2)\n3. A-D (3)\n4. C-D (4)\n5. B-E (5)\n6. D-E (6)\n\nNow, we will add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, ensuring that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\n1. Add edge A-B (1)\n2. Add edge B-C (2)\n3. Add edge A-D (3) (Adding C-D (4) would form a cycle with A-B and B-C)\n4. Add edge B-E (5) (Adding D-E (6) would form a cycle with A-D and A-B)\n\nThe minimum spanning tree now includes the edges A-B, B-C, A-D, and B-E.\n\nThe total cost is the sum of the weights of these edges: 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11.\n\nSo, the minimum cost to connect all the cities in the graph using the minimum spanning tree algorithm is 11."
