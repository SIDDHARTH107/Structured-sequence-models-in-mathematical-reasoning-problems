    "message_2": "A power set is the set of all possible subsets of a given set, including the empty set and the set itself. The number of elements in the power set of a set with n elements is 2^n.\n\nIn this case, set A has 4 elements, so the number of elements in the power set of A is 2^4 = 16.\n\nNow let's compare the number of elements in the power set of A to the number of elements in set A:\n\n- Number of elements in the power set of A: 16\n- Number of elements in set A: 4\n\nSince 16 > 4, the power set of A is larger than A.\n\nTo show that the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself, consider a set B with n elements. The number of elements in the power set of B is 2^n. Since n is a non-negative integer, 2^n will always be greater than n for n â‰¥ 1. This is because the function 2^n is an exponential function, and it grows faster than the linear function n.\n\nFor n = 0 (the empty set), the power set has 2^0 = 1 element (the empty set itself), which is still larger than the 0 elements in the empty set.\n\nTherefore, the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself."
