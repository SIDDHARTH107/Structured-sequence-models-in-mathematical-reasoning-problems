    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of the two vectors, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the components of the two vectors. For vector A:\n\nAx = |A| cos(30°) = 5 * cos(30°) = 5 * (√3 / 2) = (5√3) / 2\nAy = |A| sin(30°) = 5 * sin(30°) = 5 * (1 / 2) = 5 / 2\n\nFor vector B:\n\nBx = |B| cos(-45°) = 4 * cos(-45°) = 4 * (1 / √2) = 4 / √2 = 2√2\nBy = |B| sin(-45°) = 4 * sin(-45°) = -4 * (1 / √2) = -4 / √2 = -2√2\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nA · B = Ax * Bx + Ay * By = (5√3 / 2) * (2√2) + (5 / 2) * (-2√2) = 5√6 - 5√2\n\nNext, let's find the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors:\n\n|A| |B| = 5 * 4 = 20\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = (5√6 - 5√2) / 20\n\nθ = arccos((5√6 - 5√2) / 20)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 132.51°\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 132.51°."
