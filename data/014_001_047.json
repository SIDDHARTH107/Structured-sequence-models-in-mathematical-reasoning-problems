Compute the Euler's totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (17-1) * (11-1) = 16 * 10 = 160.\n3. Given the public key (e=7), we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo φ(n). In other words, we need to find a value for d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1.\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular multiplicative inverse of e=7 modulo φ(n)=160:\n\n7 * d ≡ 1 (mod 160)\n\nAfter solving for d, we get d = 23.\n\nSo, the private key (d) is 23, and the complete private key pair is (d=23, n=187)."
