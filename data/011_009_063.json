    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into any number of subsets. The Bell number B(n) represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements.\n\nFor 5 distinct objects, we want to find the Bell number B(5). The first few Bell numbers are:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo, there are 52 ways to arrange 5 distinct objects in groups of any size (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 objects)."
