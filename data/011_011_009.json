    "message_2": "To partition a set of 6 distinct objects into subsets of 2, 2, and 2, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Choose the first pair: There are 6 objects to choose from for the first object in the pair, and 5 objects left to choose from for the second object in the pair. This gives us 6 * 5 = 30 possible pairs. However, since the order of the objects in the pair doesn't matter, we have to divide by 2 to account for the duplicates. So, there are 30 / 2 = 15 ways to choose the first pair.\n\n2. Choose the second pair: After choosing the first pair, there are 4 objects left. We can choose the first object in the second pair in 4 ways, and the second object in the second pair in 3 ways. This gives us 4 * 3 = 12 possible pairs. Again, we have to divide by 2 to account for the duplicates. So, there are 12 / 2 = 6 ways to choose the second pair.\n\n3. The third pair: After choosing the first two pairs, there are only 2 objects left, which automatically form the third pair.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to choose the first pair and the second pair to get the total number of ways to partition the set of 6 distinct objects into subsets of 2, 2, and 2:\n\n15 ways (first pair) * 6 ways (second pair) = 90 ways."
