    "message_1": "A kite string makes an angle of 65 degrees with the ground. If the kite is 100 meters away from the student, what is the height of the kite? Use trigonometry to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. We are given the angle (65 degrees) and the distance between the student and the kite (100 meters). We need to find the height of the kite (opposite side).\n\nThe sine function is defined as:\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 65 degrees, and the hypotenuse is the distance between the student and the kite (100 meters). We want to find the opposite side (height of the kite).\n\nsin(65) = height / 100\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight = sin(65) * 100\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the height:\n\nheight = sin(65) * 100 ≈ 0.8988 * 100 ≈ 89.88 meters\n\nSo, the height of the kite is approximately 89.88 meters."
