    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree.\n4. Repeat step 3 until the minimum spanning tree has (number of vertices - 1) edges or all edges have been considered.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n1. Sort the edges:\n   (A, B, 1), (B, C, 2), (A, D, 3), (C, D, 4), (B, E, 5), (D, E, 6), (C, F, 7), (E, F, 8)\n\n2. Start with an empty graph.\n\n3. Add edges one by one:\n   - Add (A, B, 1) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Add (B, C, 2) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Add (A, D, 3) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Skip (C, D, 4) as it would form a cycle with A-B-C.\n   - Add (B, E, 5) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Skip (D, E, 6) as it would form a cycle with A-D-B-E.\n   - Add (C, F, 7) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Skip (E, F, 8) as it would form a cycle with B-C-F-E.\n\n4. The minimum spanning tree now has (6 - 1) = 5 edges, so we stop.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is as follows:\n\n- A - B (1)\n- B - C (2)\n- A - D (3)\n- B - E (5)\n- C - F (7)\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 18."
