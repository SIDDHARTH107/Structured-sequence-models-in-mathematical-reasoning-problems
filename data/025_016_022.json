    "message_2": "a) To find the equation of the asymptote of the curve, we can first simplify the given equation:\n\ny = (x^2 - 1)/(x - 2)\n\nWe can factor the numerator as a difference of squares:\n\ny = ((x - 1)(x + 1))/(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can see that as x approaches 2, the denominator approaches 0, and the function approaches infinity. This indicates that there is a vertical asymptote at x = 2. So, the equation of the asymptote is:\n\nx = 2\n\nb) To determine the birational equivalence between the curve and the line y = 2x - 3, we need to find a rational function that maps one to the other. Let's first rewrite the given curve equation in terms of x:\n\nx = (y(x - 2) + 1)/(y + 1)\n\nNow, let's set y = 2x - 3 and solve for x:\n\nx = ((2x - 3)(x - 2) + 1)/((2x - 3) + 1)\n\nx = ((2x^2 - 4x - 3x + 6) + 1)/(2x - 2)\n\nx = (2x^2 - 7x + 7)/(2x - 2)\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is (x - 1):\n\nx = (2x - 7)/(2)\n\nThus, the birational equivalence between the curve and the line y = 2x - 3 is given by the rational function:\n\nx = (2x - 7)/2"
