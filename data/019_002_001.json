Provide a proof or a counterexample to support your answer.",
    "message_2": "The statement is true. We will prove it by contradiction.\n\nAssume that the statement is false. That means there exists a positive integer n > 1 such that for all prime numbers p, n ≥ p^2.\n\nLet's consider the number N = n! + 1, where n! is the factorial of n (i.e., the product of all positive integers up to n). Notice that N > n, since n! > 0 and N = n! + 1.\n\nNow, we will show that N cannot be divisible by any prime number less than or equal to n. Let p be a prime number such that p ≤ n. Then, p divides n!, since p is a factor of one of the numbers in the product from 1 to n. Therefore, p also divides (n! + 1) - n! = 1. But this is a contradiction, as p > 1 and cannot divide 1.\n\nSince N is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to n, it must be divisible by a prime number greater than n. Let q be the smallest prime factor of N, so q > n. Then, we have N = q * k for some positive integer k.\n\nNow, we claim that q^2 > n. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that q^2 ≤ n. Then, since q is the smallest prime factor of N and q ≤ √n, we have that N = q * k ≤ q * √n < q * (q + 1) (because q > n > 1). But this contradicts the fact that N = n! + 1 > q * q, as we showed earlier that N > n.\n\nTherefore, we have found a prime number q such that n < q^2, which contradicts our initial assumption that no such prime number exists. This contradiction implies that the original statement is true: \"For all positive integers n greater than 1, there exists a prime number p such that n < p^2.\""
