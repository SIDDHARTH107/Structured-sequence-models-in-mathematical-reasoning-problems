    "message_2": "To find the minimum vertex cover, we can represent the adjacency matrix as a graph and then apply the vertex cover method. The graph representation of the given adjacency matrix is:\n\n```\n1 - 2\n|   |\n3 - 4\n```\n\nNow, we can find the minimum vertex cover by selecting the vertices that cover all edges in the graph. In this case, we can select vertices 2 and 3, which cover all the edges:\n\n```\n1 - 2\n    |\n3 - 4\n```\n\nSo, the minimum number of vertices to cover all edges in the graph is 2 (vertices 2 and 3)."
