    "message_2": "To find the probability of encountering 3 customers in a row who prefer product A, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each customer preferring product A.\n\nThe probability of one customer preferring product A is 60%, which can be written as a decimal: 0.60.\n\nSo, the probability of encountering 3 customers in a row who prefer product A is:\n\n0.60 * 0.60 * 0.60 = 0.216\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.216 or 21.6%."
