    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of the two equal sides are 12 cm each. If the perimeter of the triangle is 36 cm, what is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all three sides. In this case, the perimeter is 36 cm, and we know the lengths of the two equal sides are 12 cm each.\n\nPerimeter = Side1 + Side2 + Side3\n\n36 = 12 + 12 + Side3\n\nNow, we can solve for Side3:\n\n36 - 24 = Side3\n\n12 = Side3\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 12 cm."
