    "message_2": "A pole of a meromorphic function is a point where the function becomes infinite. To find the poles of the given function f(z) = (z^3 - 1) / (z^3 + 1), we need to find the zeros of the denominator (z^3 + 1) since the function will be infinite when the denominator is zero.\n\nLet's find the zeros of z^3 + 1:\n\nz^3 + 1 = 0\nz^3 = -1\n\nNow, we can use the cube root of unity to find the zeros:\n\nz = (-1)^(1/3)\n\nThe cube roots of unity are:\n\n1. e^(0 * 2πi/3) = 1\n2. e^(1 * 2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i * sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + (√3/2)i\n3. e^(2 * 2πi/3) = cos(4π/3) + i * sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - (√3/2)i\n\nHowever, since z^3 = -1, we are only interested in the non-real cube roots of unity:\n\n1. z1 = -1/2 + (√3/2)i\n2. z2 = -1/2 - (√3/2)i\n\nThese are the zeros of the denominator, and thus the poles of the function f(z). Now let's find their orders.\n\nThe order of a pole is the number of times it appears as a zero in the denominator. Since both z1 and z2 are simple zeros of the denominator (i.e., they have multiplicity 1), their orders as poles are also 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the poles of the meromorphic function f(z) = (z^3 - 1) / (z^3 + 1) are:\n\n1. z1 = -1/2 + (√3/2)i with order 1\n2. z2 = -1/2 - (√3/2)i with order 1"
