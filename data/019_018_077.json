    "message_2": "To prove the statement, we will use the definition of an even integer and basic algebraic manipulation.\n\nAn even integer can be defined as any integer that is a multiple of 2. In other words, if x is an even integer, then there exists an integer k such that x = 2k.\n\nNow, we want to show that if x is an even integer, then x^2 is also an even integer. Let's square x:\n\nx^2 = (2k)^2\n\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can simplify this expression:\n\nx^2 = 4k^2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nx^2 = 2(2k^2)\n\nSince 2k^2 is an integer (as the product of two integers), we can say that x^2 is a multiple of 2, which means x^2 is an even integer.\n\nThus, we have proven that if x is an even integer, then x squared is an even integer."
