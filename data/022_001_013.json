    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-2}$ along the line segment $L$ from $z_1 = 3$ to $z_2 = 6$, we first parameterize the line segment $L$. Let $t$ be a parameter that varies from $0$ to $1$. Then, we can represent the points on the line segment $L$ as:\n\n$$z(t) = (1-t)z_1 + tz_2 = (1-t)3 + t6 = 3 + 3t$$\n\nNow, we substitute $z(t)$ into the function $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z(t)) = \\frac{1}{z(t)-2} = \\frac{1}{(3+3t)-2} = \\frac{1}{1+3t}$$\n\nAs $t$ varies from $0$ to $1$, the function $f(z(t))$ represents the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ along the line segment $L$. The function $f(z)$ is already analytic everywhere except at the point $z=2$, which is not on the line segment $L$. Therefore, the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ along the line segment $L$ is given by:\n\n$$f(z(t)) = \\frac{1}{1+3t}$$"
