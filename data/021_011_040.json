    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, product A and product B. The profit earned from each unit of product A is $10 and the profit earned from each unit of product B is $15. The factory has a total production capacity of 500 units per day. The production time for 1 unit of product A is 2 hours and the production time for 1 unit of product B is 3 hours. The factory operates for a maximum of 12 hours per day. Find the optimal number of units of each product to produce per day to maximize the profit. Use the conjugate gradient method to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the conjugate gradient method, we first need to formulate the problem as a linear system of equations. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. Total production capacity: x + y ≤ 500\n2. Total production time: 2x + 3y ≤ 12 * 60 (since the factory operates for a maximum of 12 hours per day and we need to convert it to minutes)\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies both constraints. To do this, we can graph the inequalities:\n\n1. x + y = 500\n2. 2x + 3y = 12 * 60\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. The optimal solution will be at one of the vertices of the feasible region. To find the vertices, we can solve the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines:\n\n1. x + y = 500\n2. 2x + 3y = 720\n\nSolving the system of equations:\n\n2x + 3(500 - x) = 720\n2x + 1500 - 3x = 720\n-x = -780\nx = 780/3 = 260\n\nNow, substitute x back into the first equation:\n\n260 + y = 500\ny = 500 - 260 = 240\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to produce 260 units of product A and 240 units of product B per day. The maximum profit will be:\n\nP(260, 240) = 10(260) + 15(240) = 2600 + 3600 = $6200 per day."
