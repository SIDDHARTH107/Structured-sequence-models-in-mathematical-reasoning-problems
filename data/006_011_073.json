    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one machine will produce a defective screw, we can first find the probability that none of the machines produce a defective screw and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a machine not producing a defective screw is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 20 machines, the probability that none of them produce a defective screw is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one machine will produce a defective screw by subtracting the probability that none of them do from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one machine will produce a defective screw on any given day is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
