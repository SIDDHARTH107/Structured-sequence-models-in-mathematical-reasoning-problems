    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game scenario, a group of 10 players each has 10 monetary units. They are given the option to contribute any amount of their money to a common pool. The total amount in the common pool is then multiplied by a factor (e.g. 1.5) and distributed equally among all players, regardless of how much they contributed. What is the optimal contribution for each player to maximize their individual payoff?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the contribution of each player as x, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 10. The total contribution to the common pool by all players is 10x. After multiplying the total contribution by the factor (1.5 in this case), the new total is 15x. This amount is then distributed equally among all 10 players, so each player receives 1.5x.\n\nNow, let's calculate the payoff for each player. The payoff is the sum of the amount they receive from the common pool and the amount they keep from their initial 10 monetary units. The payoff for each player is:\n\nPayoff = 1.5x + (10 - x)\n\nTo maximize the payoff, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this expression. To do this, we can take the derivative of the payoff function with respect to x and set it to zero:\n\nd(Payoff)/dx = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and does not depend on x, the payoff function is a linear function, and there is no unique maximum value for x. In other words, there is no optimal contribution that maximizes the individual payoff for each player in this scenario.\n\nHowever, if we consider the group's total payoff, the optimal strategy would be for each player to contribute their entire 10 monetary units. In this case, the total contribution would be 100, and after multiplying by the factor 1.5, the new total would be 150. This amount would then be distributed equally among all 10 players, giving each player 15 monetary units, which is greater than their initial 10 units."
