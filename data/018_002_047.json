The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B.\n\nFor the element 4:\n4 ∈ A, since 4 is in set A.\n4 ∈ B, since 4 is in set B.\n\nFor the element 8:\n8 ∈ A, since 8 is in set A.\n8 ∈ B, since 8 is in set B.\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B."
