    "message_1": "Consider two firms that produce identical products and are competing in a Cournot duopoly. The demand for the product is given as:\n\nQ = 100 - 2P\n\nwhere Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price of the product.\n\nAssuming that each firm has a constant marginal cost of $20, find the equilibrium quantity produced and price charged by each firm.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity produced and price charged by each firm in a Cournot duopoly, we first need to find the reaction functions for each firm. \n\nLet q1 be the quantity produced by Firm 1 and q2 be the quantity produced by Firm 2. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2. \n\nThe inverse demand function can be found by solving the demand function for P:\n\nP = (100 - Q) / 2\n\nSince Q = q1 + q2, we can substitute this into the inverse demand function:\n\nP = (100 - (q1 + q2)) / 2\n\nThe revenue for each firm can be calculated as the product of price and quantity:\n\nR1 = P * q1 = ((100 - (q1 + q2)) / 2) * q1\nR2 = P * q2 = ((100 - (q1 + q2)) / 2) * q2\n\nEach firm has a constant marginal cost of $20, so the total cost for each firm is:\n\nC1 = 20 * q1\nC2 = 20 * q2\n\nThe profit for each firm is the difference between revenue and cost:\n\nπ1 = R1 - C1 = ((100 - (q1 + q2)) / 2) * q1 - 20 * q1\nπ2 = R2 - C2 = ((100 - (q1 + q2)) / 2) * q2 - 20 * q2\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to find the quantity that maximizes each firm's profit with respect to the other firm's quantity. We do this by taking the first-order partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to each firm's quantity and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂π1/∂q1 = (100 - 2q1 - q2)/2 - 20 = 0\n∂π2/∂q2 = (100 - q1 - 2q2)/2 - 20 = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously for q1 and q2, we get:\n\nq1 = 30 - (1/2)q2\nq2 = 30 - (1/2)q1\n\nNow we can substitute one of the equations into the other to find the equilibrium quantities:\n\nq1 = 30 - (1/2)(30 - (1/2)q1)\nq1 = 30 - 15 + (1/4)q1\n(3/4)q1 = 15\nq1 = 20\n\nSubstituting q1 back into the reaction function for q2:\n\nq2 = 30 - (1/2)(20)\nq2 = 30 - 10\nq2 = 20\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantities for both firms are q1 = q2 = 20. \n\nNow we can find the equilibrium price by substituting the equilibrium quantities into the inverse demand function:\n\nP = (100 - (q1 + q2)) / 2\nP = (100 - (20 + 20)) / 2\nP = (100 - 40) / 2\nP = 60 / 2\nP = 30\n\nThus, the equilibrium price charged by each firm is $30. In summary, each firm produces 20 units and charges a price of $30 in the Cournot duopoly equilibrium."
