    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Recall that the order of a group G is the number of elements in the group. The Sylow Theorems give us information about the possible subgroups of a group based on the order of the group.\n\nSince the order of G is 10, we can write it as a product of its prime factors: 10 = 2 * 5. Now, we will apply the Sylow Theorems to find the possible Sylow subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 2) must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. In this case, the possibilities are 1 and 5. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal in G.\n\n2. Sylow 5-subgroups: Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. In this case, the only possibility is 1. So, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it must be normal in G.\n\nNow, let P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, and let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since P is normal in G, we have that PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have that the order of PQ is |P||Q| = 5 * 2 = 10. Thus, PQ = G.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10. This is because P and Q are both cyclic (since they have prime order), and their orders are relatively prime.\n\nIf there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, then there must exist an element x in G that is not in any of the Sylow 2-subgroups. This element x cannot commute with every element of G, because if it did, it would be in the center of G, and G would be abelian. But in this case, G would be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10, which contradicts the assumption that there are five Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nTherefore, if there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, there exists an element in G that does not commute with every element of G. In this case, G must be isomorphic to either the dihedral group D5 or the non-abelian group of order 10, since these are the only non-abelian groups of order 10.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10, or there exists an element of G that does not commute with every element of G, and hence G must be isomorphic to either the dihedral group D5 or the non-abelian group of order 10."
