    "message_1": "A store has conducted a market research and found that the probability of a customer buying at least one item in a shopping trip is 0.8. On a given day, the store has 50 customers. What is the probability that at least 40 of them will make a purchase?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this case, n = 50 (number of customers), p = 0.8 (probability of a customer making a purchase), and we want to find the probability of at least 40 customers making a purchase, which means we need to find the probability for k = 40, 41, 42, ..., 50.\n\nTo find the probability of at least 40 customers making a purchase, we can sum the probabilities for each k from 40 to 50:\n\nP(X ≥ 40) = P(X = 40) + P(X = 41) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(50, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(50-k)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for k from 40 to 50 and sum the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 40) = Σ [C(50, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(50-k)] for k = 40 to 50\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the binomial probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 40) ≈ 0.956\n\nSo, the probability that at least 40 customers will make a purchase is approximately 0.956 or 95.6%."
