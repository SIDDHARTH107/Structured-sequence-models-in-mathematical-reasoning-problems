What is the shortest possible route he can take if the distances in kilometers between the cities are as follows: City 1 to City 2 is 10km, City 1 to City 3 is 12km, City 1 to City 4 is 15km, City 1 to City 5 is 20km, City 2 to City 3 is 8km, City 2 to City 4 is 14km, City 2 to City 5 is 16km, City 3 to City 4 is 6km, City 3 to City 5 is 9km, and City 4 to City 5 is 5km.",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can list all possible routes and calculate their total distances. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5, resulting in 4! (4 factorial) which is 24 possible routes. Here are the routes and their total distances:\n\n1. 1-2-3-4-5: 10+8+6+5 = 29 km\n2. 1-2-3-5-4: 10+8+9+5 = 32 km\n3. 1-2-4-3-5: 10+14+6+9 = 39 km\n4. 1-2-4-5-3: 10+14+5+9 = 38 km\n5. 1-2-5-3-4: 10+16+9+6 = 41 km\n6. 1-2-5-4-3: 10+16+5+6 = 37 km\n7. 1-3-2-4-5: 12+8+14+5 = 39 km\n8. 1-3-2-5-4: 12+8+16+5 = 41 km\n9. 1-3-4-2-5: 12+6+14+16 = 48 km\n10. 1-3-4-5-2: 12+6+5+16 = 39 km\n11. 1-3-5-2-4: 12+9+16+14 = 51 km\n12. 1-3-5-4-2: 12+9+5+14 = 40 km\n13. 1-4-2-3-5: 15+14+8+9 = 46 km\n14. 1-4-2-5-3: 15+14+16+9 = 54 km\n15. 1-4-3-2-5: 15+6+8+16 = 45 km\n16. 1-4-3-5-2: 15+6+9+16 = 46 km\n17. 1-4-5-2-3: 15+5+16+8 = 44 km\n18. 1-4-5-3-2: 15+5+9+8 = 37 km\n19. 1-5-2-3-4: 20+16+8+6 = 50 km\n20. 1-5-2-4-3: 20+16+14+6 = 56 km\n21. 1-5-3-2-4: 20+9+8+14 = 51 km\n22. 1-5-3-4-2: 20+9+6+14 = 49 km\n23. 1-5-4-2-3: 20+5+14+8 = 47 km\n24. 1-5-4-3-2: 20+5+6+8 = 39 km\n\nThe shortest possible route is 1-2-3-4-5 with a total distance of 29 km."
