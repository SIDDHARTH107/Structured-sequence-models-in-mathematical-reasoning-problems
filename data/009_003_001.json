    "message_1": "A metal bar of length 10 cm has a temperature of 100°C at one end and 50°C at the other end. The bar has a thermal conductivity of 50 J/(s.m.C°) and a cross-sectional area of 1 cm^2. Write a differential equation that models the heat transfer in the bar and find the temperature distribution in the bar at t=10 seconds. Assume that there is no heat loss to the environment.",
    "message_2": "To model the heat transfer in the bar, we can use Fourier's Law of heat conduction. The rate of heat transfer (Q) through the bar is given by:\n\nQ = -k * A * (dT/dx)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity (50 J/(s.m.C°)), A is the cross-sectional area (1 cm^2 = 0.0001 m^2), and dT/dx is the temperature gradient along the length of the bar.\n\nSince there is no heat loss to the environment, the rate of heat transfer is constant along the bar. Therefore, we can write the differential equation as:\n\nd^2T/dx^2 = 0\n\nTo find the temperature distribution in the bar, we need to solve this differential equation with the given boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = 100°C\nT(10) = 50°C\n\nIntegrating the differential equation once with respect to x, we get:\n\ndT/dx = C1\n\nIntegrating again with respect to x, we get:\n\nT(x) = C1 * x + C2\n\nNow, we can use the boundary conditions to find the constants C1 and C2:\n\nT(0) = 100°C = C1 * 0 + C2 => C2 = 100°C\n\nT(10) = 50°C = C1 * 10 + 100 => C1 = (50 - 100) / 10 = -5°C/cm\n\nSo, the temperature distribution in the bar is given by:\n\nT(x) = -5 * x + 100\n\nNow, we are asked to find the temperature distribution at t = 10 seconds. However, the given information and the derived equation are independent of time, as we assumed no heat loss to the environment. Therefore, the temperature distribution remains the same at t = 10 seconds:\n\nT(x) = -5 * x + 100"
