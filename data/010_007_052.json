    "message_2": "The space formed by taking the unit circle $S^1$ in the plane and removing the point $(0,1)$ is homotopy equivalent to the punctured plane $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. To see this, consider a radial deformation retraction that pushes every point on the unit circle (except $(0,1)$) towards the origin along the radial line connecting the point to the origin. The point $(0,1)$ is not affected by this deformation retraction, so the resulting space is the punctured plane.\n\nNow, we can compute the fundamental group of the punctured plane. The punctured plane is an open subset of the plane, so it is path-connected. Let $x_0$ be a base point in the punctured plane, and let $\\gamma$ be a loop in the punctured plane based at $x_0$. We can homotope $\\gamma$ to a loop that avoids a small neighborhood of the origin. Then, we can further homotope this loop to a loop that lies entirely in the punctured plane minus a small disk centered at the origin.\n\nNow, consider the map $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to S^1$ given by $f(x) = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}$. This map is continuous and maps the punctured plane minus a small disk centered at the origin to the unit circle minus a small arc around $(0,1)$. The map $f$ sends the homotoped loop to a loop in the unit circle minus a small arc around $(0,1)$, which is homotopy equivalent to the original space.\n\nSince the fundamental group of the unit circle is $\\mathbb{Z}$, the fundamental group of the punctured plane is also $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the fundamental group of the space formed by taking the unit circle $S^1$ in the plane and removing the point $(0,1)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$."
