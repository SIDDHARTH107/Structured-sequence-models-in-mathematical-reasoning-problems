    "message_2": "In fuzzy logic, the degree of membership represents how much an element belongs to a certain set. In this case, we have two sets: \"fast\" and \"not fast.\" To determine the degree of membership for each set, we need to define the criteria for what is considered \"fast\" and \"not fast.\"\n\nLet's assume that a car traveling at a speed of 0-40 km/h is considered \"not fast,\" and a car traveling at a speed of 80-120 km/h is considered \"fast.\" We can create a linear function for each set to represent the degree of membership.\n\nFor the \"not fast\" set, the degree of membership decreases linearly from 1 at 0 km/h to 0 at 40 km/h. For the \"fast\" set, the degree of membership increases linearly from 0 at 80 km/h to 1 at 120 km/h.\n\nNow, we can calculate the degree of membership for a car traveling at 60 km/h:\n\n1. \"Not fast\" degree of membership:\nSince 60 km/h is halfway between 40 km/h and 80 km/h, the degree of membership for the \"not fast\" set is 0.5.\n\n2. \"Fast\" degree of membership:\nSince 60 km/h is halfway between 40 km/h and 80 km/h, the degree of membership for the \"fast\" set is also 0.5.\n\nSo, the degree of membership for a car traveling at 60 km/h is 0.5 for both \"fast\" and \"not fast\" sets."
