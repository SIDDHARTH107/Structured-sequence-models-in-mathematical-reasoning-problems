    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, each line segment of the initial square is divided into 3 equal parts, and there are 5 smaller squares in each iteration. So, N = 5 and s = 3.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the iteration is done 5 times and each line segment of the initial square is divided into 3 equal parts is approximately 1.46497. Note that the number of iterations does not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it is a property of the fractal itself, not the specific iteration."
