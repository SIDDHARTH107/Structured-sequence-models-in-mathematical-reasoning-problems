    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(2x) = sin(x), we can use the double angle formula for cosine:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1 - 2sin^2(x) = sin(x)\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation in terms of sin(x):\n\n2sin^2(x) + sin(x) - 1 = 0\n\nLet y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 + y - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 1, and c = -1:\n\ny = (-(1) ± √((1)^2 - 4(2)(-1))) / 2(2)\ny = (-1 ± √(1 + 8)) / 4\ny = (-1 ± √9) / 4\ny = (-1 ± 3) / 4\n\nThere are two possible values for y (sin(x)):\n\ny1 = (-1 + 3) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\ny2 = (-1 - 3) / 4 = -4 / 4 = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that correspond to these values of sin(x):\n\nFor y1 = 1/2:\n\nsin(x) = 1/2\nx = arcsin(1/2)\n\nSince the general solution for sin(x) = k is x = arcsin(k) + 2nπ, where n is an integer:\n\nx = arcsin(1/2) + 2nπ\nx = π/6 + 2nπ, where n is an integer\n\nFor y2 = -1:\n\nsin(x) = -1\nx = arcsin(-1)\n\nSince the general solution for sin(x) = k is x = arcsin(k) + 2nπ, where n is an integer:\n\nx = arcsin(-1) + 2nπ\nx = -π/2 + 2nπ, where n is an integer\n\nSo, the general solutions for x are:\n\nx = π/6 + 2nπ and x = -π/2 + 2nπ, where n is an integer."
