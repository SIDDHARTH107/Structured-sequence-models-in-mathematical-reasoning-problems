    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, X and Y, with profits of $25 and $20 per unit, respectively. The factory has a maximum production capacity of 400 units per day, and it takes 2 hours and 3 hours to produce one unit of X and Y, respectively. If the factory wants to maximize its profit, what is the optimal production quantity of X and Y per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe profit function is given by P(x, y) = 25x + 20y.\n\nThe factory has a maximum production capacity of 400 units per day, so x + y ≤ 400.\n\nThe time constraint is given by 2x + 3y, as it takes 2 hours to produce one unit of X and 3 hours to produce one unit of Y. Let's assume the factory operates for T hours per day. Then, 2x + 3y ≤ T.\n\nNow, we need to maximize the profit function P(x, y) subject to the constraints x + y ≤ 400 and 2x + 3y ≤ T.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of linear programming. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 400\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ T\n\nRearrange the inequalities to find the intercepts:\n\n1. y ≤ -x + 400\n2. y ≤ (-2/3)x + T/3\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraints intersect. There are three vertices:\n\n1. (0, 0) - intersection of x-axis and y-axis\n2. (0, 400) - intersection of y-axis and the line y = -x + 400\n3. (T/2, (T/6)) - intersection of the lines y = -x + 400 and y = (-2/3)x + T/3\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 25(0) + 20(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 400) = 25(0) + 20(400) = 8000\n3. P(T/2, T/6) = 25(T/2) + 20(T/6) = (25/2)T + (10)T = (35/2)T\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to choose the vertex with the highest profit value. Since T is the number of hours the factory operates per day, it must be a positive value. Therefore, the profit at vertex 3 will always be greater than the profit at vertex 2, as (35/2)T > 8000 for any positive value of T.\n\nThus, the optimal production quantity of X and Y per day is given by the coordinates of vertex 3, which are (T/2, T/6) units of X and Y, respectively. The factory should adjust its production of X and Y based on the number of hours it operates per day to maximize its profit."
