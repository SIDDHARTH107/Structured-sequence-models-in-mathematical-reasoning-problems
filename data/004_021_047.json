    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x), we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x).\n\nf(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 5\n\nUsing the power rule, the first derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 48(2) + 12\nf''(2) = 36(4) - 96 + 12\nf''(2) = 144 - 96 + 12\nf''(2) = 60\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) evaluated at x = 2 is 60."
