    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of the given signal f(t) = sin(2πt) + 0.5cos(6πt), we need to apply the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1) and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of each component of the signal separately:\n\n1) Fourier transform of sin(2πt):\n\nThe Fourier transform of sin(2πt) can be found using the following formula:\n\nF(ω) = (j/2) [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)], where δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n2) Fourier transform of 0.5cos(6πt):\n\nThe Fourier transform of cos(6πt) can be found using the following formula:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2) [δ(ω - 6π) + δ(ω + 6π)].\n\nNow, we need to multiply this result by 0.5:\n\nF(ω) = (1/4) [δ(ω - 6π) + δ(ω + 6π)].\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of the whole signal by adding the Fourier transforms of its components:\n\nF(ω) = (j/2) [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)] + (1/4) [δ(ω - 6π) + δ(ω + 6π)].\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude and phase angle of each frequency component in F(ω):\n\n1) For the frequency component at ω = 2π:\n\nAmplitude = |j/2| = 1/2\nPhase angle = arg(j/2) = arg(j) = π/2\n\n2) For the frequency component at ω = -2π:\n\nAmplitude = |-j/2| = 1/2\nPhase angle = arg(-j/2) = arg(-j) = -π/2\n\n3) For the frequency component at ω = 6π:\n\nAmplitude = |1/4| = 1/4\nPhase angle = arg(1/4) = 0\n\n4) For the frequency component at ω = -6π:\n\nAmplitude = |1/4| = 1/4\nPhase angle = arg(1/4) = 0\n\nSo, the frequency domain representation of the given signal is:\n\nF(ω) = (j/2) [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)] + (1/4) [δ(ω - 6π) + δ(ω + 6π)],\n\nwith the amplitude and phase angle of each frequency component as follows:\n\nω = 2π: Amplitude = 1/2, Phase angle = π/2\nω = -2π: Amplitude = 1/2, Phase angle = -π/2\nω = 6π: Amplitude = 1/4, Phase angle = 0\nω = -6π: Amplitude = 1/4, Phase angle = 0"
