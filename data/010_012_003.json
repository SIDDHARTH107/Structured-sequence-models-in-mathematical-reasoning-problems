    "message_2": "To determine if a function is smooth, we need to check if it is continuous and has continuous first and second derivatives over the given interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of f(x):\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1 (first derivative)\nf''(x) = 6x - 4 (second derivative)\n\nNow, let's analyze the continuity of f(x), f'(x), and f''(x) over the interval [0, 2].\n\nf(x) is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are continuous everywhere, including the interval [0, 2].\n\nf'(x) is also a polynomial function, so it is continuous everywhere, including the interval [0, 2].\n\nf''(x) is a polynomial function as well, so it is continuous everywhere, including the interval [0, 2].\n\nSince f(x), f'(x), and f''(x) are all continuous over the interval [0, 2], we can conclude that f(x) is a smooth function over this interval."
