    "message_1": "A student is at a distance of 20 meters away from a building. The angle of elevation from the student's eye to the top of the building is 30 degrees. Find the height of the building using trigonometry. Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the height of the building (opposite side) and the distance from the building (adjacent side).\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\n\nIn this problem, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, and the distance from the building is 20 meters.\n\ntan(30) = height/20\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(30)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, multiply this value by 20 to find the height:\n\nheight ≈ 20 * 0.577\nheight ≈ 11.54\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 12 meters."
