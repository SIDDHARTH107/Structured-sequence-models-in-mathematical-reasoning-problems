    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. A graph G has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.\n\nFirst, let's check if the graph G is connected. Since G has 10 vertices and 14 edges, it is possible for the graph to be connected (for example, a connected graph with 10 vertices can have a minimum of 9 edges). However, we cannot guarantee that G is connected without more information about the specific edges.\n\nNow, let's check the degree of the vertices. The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 14 = 28. Since the sum of the degrees is even, there must be an even number of vertices with odd degree.\n\nIf G is connected and has exactly 2 vertices with odd degree, then it has an Eulerian path. However, without more information about the specific edges and the degrees of the vertices, we cannot determine if G has an Eulerian path or provide the order of vertices that make up the Eulerian path."
