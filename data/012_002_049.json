    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of the graph G with 7 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the following observations:\n\n1. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\n2. The chromatic number of a complete graph (a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge) with n vertices is n.\n\n3. A graph with 7 vertices can have at most 21 edges (since a complete graph with 7 vertices, K7, has 7 * (7 - 1) / 2 = 21 edges).\n\nSince the graph G has 10 edges, it is not a complete graph, and its chromatic number will be less than 7. We can't determine the exact chromatic number without knowing the specific structure of the graph, but we can provide an upper bound.\n\nThe maximum chromatic number for a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges is 6. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, the graph could be almost complete, missing just one edge to become a complete graph (which would require 7 colors). In this case, one vertex could be adjacent to all other vertices except one, and we would need 6 colors to color the graph properly.\n\nSo, without knowing the specific structure of the graph G, we can only say that its chromatic number is at most 6."
