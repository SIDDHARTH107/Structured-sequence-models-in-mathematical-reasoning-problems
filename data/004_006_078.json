    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1, we first need to find the derivative of the function, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as critical points occur when the derivative is zero or undefined. In this case, the derivative is a quadratic function, so it will never be undefined. We just need to find the zeros.\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo make it easier to solve, we can divide the entire equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two solutions for x:\n\nx = 1 and x = 3\n\nThese are the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1."
