    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem related to solving systems of linear equations with complex coefficients:\n\nSolve the following system of linear equations with complex coefficients:\n\n(3 + 2i)x + (4 - 5i)y = -2i\n\n(7 - 3i)x + (2 + i)y = 4 + 6i\n\nWhat are the values of x and y that satisfy both equations?",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by (7 - 3i) and the second equation by (3 + 2i) to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(3 + 2i)(7 - 3i)x + (4 - 5i)(7 - 3i)y = -2i(7 - 3i)\n(7 - 3i)(3 + 2i)x + (2 + i)(3 + 2i)y = (4 + 6i)(3 + 2i)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equations:\n\n(13 + 17i)y = -14 + 4i\n(13 - 17i)y = 26 + 22i\n\nNow, let's add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(13 + 17i)y + (13 - 17i)y = -14 + 4i + 26 + 22i\n26y = 12 + 26i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 26 to find the value of y:\n\ny = (12 + 26i) / 26\ny = 1/2 + i\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation:\n\n(3 + 2i)x + (4 - 5i)(1/2 + i) = -2i\n\n(3 + 2i)x + (4 - 5i)/2 + (4 - 5i)i = -2i\n\n(3 + 2i)x = -2 + (5/2)i - 4i + 5i^2\n(3 + 2i)x = -2 + (5/2)i - 4i - 5\n(3 + 2i)x = -7 + (1/2)i\n\nNow, divide both sides by (3 + 2i):\n\nx = (-7 + (1/2)i) / (3 + 2i)\n\nTo divide complex numbers, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\nx = (-7 + (1/2)i)(3 - 2i) / (3 + 2i)(3 - 2i)\nx = (-21 + 14i + (3/2)i - i^2) / (9 + 4)\nx = (-21 + 14i + (3/2)i + 1) / 13\nx = (-20 + (29/2)i) / 13\n\nx = -20/13 + (29/26)i\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are:\n\nx = -20/13 + (29/26)i\ny = 1/2 + i"
