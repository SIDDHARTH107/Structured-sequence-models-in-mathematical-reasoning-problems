    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest clique in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, we can observe the following cliques:\n\n1. {A, B, C} - A 3-clique (triangle)\n2. {D, E, F} - A 3-clique (triangle)\n\nThere are no 4-cliques or larger in this graph. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
