    "message_2": "To find the expected number of times this specific type of attack will occur, you can multiply the probability of the attack occurring by the total number of attacks.\n\nExpected number of specific attacks = Probability of specific attack * Total number of attacks\n\nExpected number of specific attacks = 0.05 * 1000\n\nExpected number of specific attacks = 50\n\nSo, the expected number of times this specific type of attack will occur is 50 times."
