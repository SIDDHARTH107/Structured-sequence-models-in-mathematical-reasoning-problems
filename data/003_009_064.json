    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have a = 8 cm, b = 13 cm, and angle C = 125 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = 125 * (π / 180) ≈ 2.1817 radians\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side c:\n\nc² = 8² + 13² - 2 * 8 * 13 * cos(2.1817)\nc² ≈ 64 + 169 - 208 * (-0.4226)\nc² ≈ 233 + 87.92\nc² ≈ 320.92\n\nNow, take the square root to find the length of side c:\n\nc ≈ √320.92 ≈ 17.91 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 8 + 13 + 17.91\nPerimeter ≈ 38.91 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 38.91 cm."
