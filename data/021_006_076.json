Use finite element method with linear elements to approximate the solution of the PDE at t = 1. \n\nWhat is the maximum error between the exact solution and the numerical solution using a mesh with 10 linear elements?",
    "message_2": "To solve the given PDE using the finite element method with linear elements, we first need to discretize the domain and set up the weak formulation of the problem. Let's divide the domain [0, 1] into 10 equal intervals, each of length h = 1/10. We will use linear basis functions, which are piecewise linear functions that are 1 at a node and 0 at all other nodes.\n\nNow, let's set up the weak formulation of the problem. We multiply the PDE by a test function v and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫(u_t * v) dx = ∫(2u_xx * v) dx - ∫(u * v) dx\n\nWe can integrate the second term by parts to obtain:\n\n∫(u_t * v) dx = -2∫(u_x * v_x) dx + 2(u_x * v)|0^1 - ∫(u * v) dx\n\nSince u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0, the boundary term vanishes:\n\n∫(u_t * v) dx = -2∫(u_x * v_x) dx - ∫(u * v) dx\n\nNow, we can discretize the problem by approximating u(x, t) as a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\nu(x, t) ≈ ∑(U_i(t) * φ_i(x))\n\nwhere U_i(t) are the coefficients to be determined and φ_i(x) are the linear basis functions. We can substitute this approximation into the weak formulation and solve for the coefficients U_i(t) using the Galerkin method.\n\nOnce we have the coefficients U_i(t), we can approximate the solution of the PDE at t = 1 using the linear combination of basis functions. To find the maximum error between the exact solution and the numerical solution, we need to find the exact solution of the PDE.\n\nThe given PDE is a linear parabolic PDE, and its exact solution can be found using separation of variables or other analytical methods. The exact solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = e^(-π^2 * t) * sin(π * x)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the exact solution at t = 1:\n\nu(x, 1) = e^(-π^2) * sin(π * x)\n\nTo find the maximum error, we need to compare the exact solution with the numerical solution at the nodes:\n\nerror_i = |u(x_i, 1) - U_i(1)|\n\nThe maximum error is then:\n\nmax_error = max(error_i)\n\nWithout the actual numerical values of the coefficients U_i(1), we cannot compute the exact value of the maximum error. However, the procedure outlined above can be followed to find the maximum error between the exact solution and the numerical solution using a mesh with 10 linear elements."
