    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is a fractal that is obtained by iteratively replacing a line segment with four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original. After each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nLet's denote the number of iterations as n, the initial length of the line segment as L, and the perimeter of the Koch island after n iterations as P(n).\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of each segment is L/3, and there are 4 segments, so the perimeter of the Koch curve is 4(L/3). Since there are three sides in the equilateral triangle, the perimeter of the Koch island after the first iteration is 3 * 4(L/3) = 4L.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the perimeter of the Koch island is multiplied by a factor of 4/3. Therefore, the perimeter after n iterations can be expressed as:\n\nP(n) = L * (4/3)^n\n\nIn this problem, the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter after the sixth iteration (n = 6):\n\nP(6) = 1 * (4/3)^6\nP(6) â‰ˆ 1 * 12.586\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after the sixth iteration is approximately 12.586 units."
