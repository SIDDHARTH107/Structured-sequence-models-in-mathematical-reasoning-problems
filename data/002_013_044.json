    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Length * Width * Height\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular pyramid are:\nLength = 8 units\nWidth = 6 units\nHeight = 4 units\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 8 * 6 * 4\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 192\n\nVolume = 64 cubic units"
