    "message_2": "To determine the homology group H_1(X, Z/3Z), we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for homology. The theorem states that there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H_{i-1}(X, Z), G) → H_i(X, G) → Hom(H_i(X, Z), G) → 0\n\nwhere G is the coefficient group (in this case, Z/3Z), Ext and Hom are the Ext and Hom functors, and H_i(X, Z) and H_{i-1}(X, Z) are the homology groups with integer coefficients.\n\nSince we are interested in H_1(X, Z/3Z), we have i = 1. Thus, the short exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → Ext(H_0(X, Z), Z/3Z) → H_1(X, Z/3Z) → Hom(H_1(X, Z), Z/3Z) → 0\n\nNow, H_0(X, Z) is usually isomorphic to Z (assuming X is connected), and H_1(X, Z) is given to be isomorphic to Z/2Z. We can compute the Ext and Hom terms:\n\n1. Ext(H_0(X, Z), Z/3Z) = Ext(Z, Z/3Z) = 0, since Ext(Z, G) = 0 for any finite abelian group G.\n2. Hom(H_1(X, Z), Z/3Z) = Hom(Z/2Z, Z/3Z) = 0, since there are no non-trivial homomorphisms between Z/2Z and Z/3Z.\n\nNow, the short exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → 0 → H_1(X, Z/3Z) → 0 → 0\n\nThis implies that H_1(X, Z/3Z) is isomorphic to the trivial group {0}, or in other words, H_1(X, Z/3Z) = 0."
