    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 2, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule (d/dx (x^n) = nx^(n-1)), we get:\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7)\n\nAgain, using the power rule, we get:\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 12x + 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 2 is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 12x + 10."
