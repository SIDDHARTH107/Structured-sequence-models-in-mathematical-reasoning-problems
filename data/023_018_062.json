    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the given system using the Fourier transform method, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the given differential equation, we get:\n\nY''(ω) + 2Y'(ω) + 5Y(ω) = U(ω)\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t) and U(ω) is the Fourier transform of u(t).\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transforms of y'(t) and y''(t). Using the property of the Fourier transform, the derivative in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by jω in the frequency domain:\n\nY'(ω) = jωY(ω)\nY''(ω) = (jω)^2Y(ω) = -ω^2Y(ω)\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the transformed differential equation, we get:\n\n-ω^2Y(ω) + 2jωY(ω) + 5Y(ω) = U(ω)\n\nNow, we can solve for the transfer function H(ω), which is defined as the ratio of the output Y(ω) to the input U(ω):\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / U(ω)\n\nRearranging the transformed differential equation to isolate Y(ω), we get:\n\nY(ω) = U(ω) / (-ω^2 + 2jω + 5)\n\nThus, the transfer function H(ω) is:\n\nH(ω) = 1 / (-ω^2 + 2jω + 5)"
