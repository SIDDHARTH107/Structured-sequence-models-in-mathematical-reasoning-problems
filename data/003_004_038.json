    "message_2": "To find all solutions to the trigonometric equation 2sinx + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2pi], we first isolate sinx:\n\n2sinx + 1 = 0\n2sinx = -1\nsinx = -1/2\n\nNow, we need to find all angles x in the interval [0, 2pi] for which sinx = -1/2. Recall that the sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants. Therefore, we need to find the reference angle in the third and fourth quadrants.\n\nSince sin(pi/6) = 1/2, the reference angle is pi/6. Now, we find the angles in the third and fourth quadrants:\n\nThird quadrant angle: pi + pi/6 = 7pi/6\nFourth quadrant angle: 2pi - pi/6 = 11pi/6\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation 2sinx + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2pi] are x = 7pi/6 and x = 11pi/6."
