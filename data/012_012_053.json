    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In this case, we have a graph G with 9 vertices, and each vertex has degree 3. Let's analyze the possible cycles in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of edges in the graph G. Since each vertex has degree 3, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 9 * 3 = 27. However, each edge is counted twice in this sum (once for each of its endpoints), so the total number of edges in G is 27 / 2 = 13.5. Since the number of edges must be an integer, this situation is not possible.\n\nThus, there is no graph G with 9 vertices and each vertex having degree 3. Therefore, we cannot determine the girth of the graph G in this case."
