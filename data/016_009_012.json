    "message_2": "The dragon curve is a fractal pattern that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to form a series of right angles. The length of each stage of the dragon curve can be determined using the formula:\n\nLength of Stage n = Length of Stage 0 * 2^(n/2)\n\nIn this case, we are asked to find the length of Stage 6 of the dragon curve when the length of Stage 0 is 1 unit. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength of Stage 6 = 1 * 2^(6/2)\nLength of Stage 6 = 1 * 2^3\nLength of Stage 6 = 1 * 8\nLength of Stage 6 = 8 units\n\nSo, the length of Stage 6 of the dragon curve is 8 units."
