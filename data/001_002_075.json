    "message_2": "To graph the linear equation y = 2x - 1, we first need to find the y-intercept, x-intercept, and slope of the equation.\n\n1. Y-intercept: The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. To find it, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0) - 1\ny = -1\n\nSo, the y-intercept is -1, which corresponds to the point (0, -1).\n\n2. X-intercept: The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. To find it, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x - 1\n1 = 2x\nx = 1/2\n\nSo, the x-intercept is 1/2, which corresponds to the point (1/2, 0).\n\n3. Slope: The slope of the equation is the coefficient of x, which is 2. This means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units.\n\nNow that we have the y-intercept, x-intercept, and slope, we can sketch the graph:\n\n1. Plot the y-intercept point (0, -1) on the graph.\n2. From the y-intercept point, use the slope to find another point on the line. Since the slope is 2, we can go up 2 units and to the right 1 unit to find the point (1, 1).\n3. Plot the x-intercept point (1/2, 0) on the graph.\n4. Draw a straight line through the points (0, -1), (1/2, 0), and (1, 1).\n\nThe graph of the linear equation y = 2x - 1 is now complete."
