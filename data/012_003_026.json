    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of independent vertices, we need to select vertices that are not connected by an edge. In this graph, one possible selection of independent vertices is {A, C, F, G}. Another possible selection is {B, D, E}. Both of these selections have 4 independent vertices, so the maximum number of independent vertices that can be selected from this graph is 4."
