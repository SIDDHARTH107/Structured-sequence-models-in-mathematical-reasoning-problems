    "message_2": "To create the truth table for the disjunction (OR) of two propositions P and Q, we need to consider all possible combinations of truth values for P and Q. Since P is true half the time and Q is true a third of the time, we can represent this using fractions. The OR operation is true if at least one of the propositions is true. Here's the truth table:\n\nP      | Q      | P OR Q\n-------------------------\n1/2    | 1/3    | 1 - (1/2)*(2/3) = 5/6\n1/2    | 2/3    | 1 - (1/2)*(1/3) = 3/4\n1/2    | 0      | 1/2\n0      | 1/3    | 1/3\n0      | 2/3    | 2/3\n0      | 0      | 0\n\nIn this truth table, the fractions represent the probability of each proposition being true. The P OR Q column shows the probability of the disjunction being true for each combination of P and Q."
