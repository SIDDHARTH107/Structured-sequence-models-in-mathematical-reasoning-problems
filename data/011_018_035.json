    "message_2": "To find the number of ways the teacher can create the teams, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (30), k is the number of students in each team (5), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nFirst, we need to divide the class into 6 teams of 5 students each, since 30 students / 5 students per team = 6 teams.\n\nNow, we can calculate the combinations for each team:\n\nTeam 1: C(30, 5) = 30! / (5!(30-5)!) = 142506\nAfter selecting the first team, there are 25 students left.\n\nTeam 2: C(25, 5) = 25! / (5!(25-5)!) = 53,130\nAfter selecting the second team, there are 20 students left.\n\nTeam 3: C(20, 5) = 20! / (5!(20-5)!) = 15,504\nAfter selecting the third team, there are 15 students left.\n\nTeam 4: C(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15-5)!) = 3,003\nAfter selecting the fourth team, there are 10 students left.\n\nTeam 5: C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 252\nAfter selecting the fifth team, there are 5 students left.\n\nTeam 6: C(5, 5) = 5! / (5!(5-5)!) = 1\nAfter selecting the sixth team, there are no students left.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the combinations for each team together:\n\nTotal combinations = 142506 * 53,130 * 15,504 * 3,003 * 252 * 1 = 4,862,659,246,796,800\n\nSo, there are 4,862,659,246,796,800 different ways the teacher can create the teams."
