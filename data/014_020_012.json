    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a Vigenere cipher message and you know that the key length used was 5. You also have knowledge of the frequency distribution of letters in the English language. If the frequency analysis of the cipher text reveals that the most common letter is \"R,\" what is the most likely letter of the key that was used?",
    "message_2": "To find the most likely letter of the key, we can use the frequency analysis of the ciphertext and the knowledge of the frequency distribution of letters in the English language. The most common letter in English is \"E\" with a frequency of about 12.7%. Since the most common letter in the ciphertext is \"R,\" we can assume that \"E\" was encrypted to \"R\" using the key.\n\nTo find the key letter, we can use the Vigenère cipher's decryption method, which is subtracting the key letter from the ciphertext letter (modulo 26). In this case, we want to find the key letter K such that:\n\nE - K ≡ R (mod 26)\n\nWe can convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\n4 - K ≡ 17 (mod 26)\n\nNow, we can solve for K:\n\nK ≡ 4 - 17 (mod 26)\nK ≡ -13 (mod 26)\nK ≡ 13 (mod 26)\n\nThe numerical value 13 corresponds to the letter \"N\". Therefore, the most likely letter of the key that was used is \"N\"."
