    "message_2": "To solve the given equation sin²x + 2sinx - 1 = 0, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in terms of sinx. Let y = sinx, then the equation becomes:\n\ny² + 2y - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (-2 ± √(2² - 4(1)(-1))) / 2(1)\ny = (-2 ± √(4 + 4)) / 2\ny = (-2 ± √8) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible values for y:\n\ny1 = (-2 + √8) / 2 ≈ 0.4142\ny2 = (-2 - √8) / 2 ≈ -2.4142\n\nHowever, since the sine function has a range of -1 to 1, the second value (y2) is not possible. Therefore, we only need to consider y1:\n\nsinx = 0.4142\n\nNow, we can find the values of x between 0 and 360 degrees that satisfy this equation:\n\nx = arcsin(0.4142)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 24.62°\n\nSince the sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants, we also need to find the corresponding angle in the second quadrant:\n\nx2 = 180° - 24.62° ≈ 155.38°\n\nSo, the two values of x that satisfy the given equation are:\n\nx ≈ 24.62° and x ≈ 155.38°"
