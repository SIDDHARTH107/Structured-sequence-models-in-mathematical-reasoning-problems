    "message_1": "A signal consists of a periodic square wave with a frequency of 10 Hz and a peak amplitude of 5 volts. Using the Fourier transform, calculate the frequency and amplitude of the harmonics up to the fifth order.",
    "message_2": "A periodic square wave can be represented as a sum of its odd harmonics using the Fourier series. The general formula for the amplitude of the nth harmonic is given by:\n\nAn = (2 * Vp) / (n * π)\n\nwhere An is the amplitude of the nth harmonic, Vp is the peak amplitude of the square wave (5 volts in this case), and n is the harmonic number (odd integers).\n\nThe frequency of the nth harmonic is given by:\n\nfn = n * f0\n\nwhere fn is the frequency of the nth harmonic, n is the harmonic number, and f0 is the fundamental frequency (10 Hz in this case).\n\nWe will calculate the frequency and amplitude of the harmonics up to the fifth order (n = 1, 3, 5).\n\n1st Harmonic (n = 1):\nA1 = (2 * 5) / (1 * π) ≈ 3.1831 V\nf1 = 1 * 10 = 10 Hz\n\n3rd Harmonic (n = 3):\nA3 = (2 * 5) / (3 * π) ≈ 1.0610 V\nf3 = 3 * 10 = 30 Hz\n\n5th Harmonic (n = 5):\nA5 = (2 * 5) / (5 * π) ≈ 0.6366 V\nf5 = 5 * 10 = 50 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency and amplitude of the harmonics up to the fifth order are:\n\n1st Harmonic: 10 Hz, 3.1831 V\n3rd Harmonic: 30 Hz, 1.0610 V\n5th Harmonic: 50 Hz, 0.6366 V"
