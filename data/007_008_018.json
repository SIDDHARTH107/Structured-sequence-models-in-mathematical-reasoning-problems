    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). In this case, p = 17, which is a prime number.\n\nFirst, let's find the remainder of 73 when divided by 17:\n73 ≡ 5 (mod 17) since 73 = 17 * 4 + 5.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the original problem as finding the remainder when 5^43 is divided by 17.\n\nUsing Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that 5^(17-1) ≡ 1 (mod 17). So, 5^16 ≡ 1 (mod 17).\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 43 is divided by 16:\n43 ≡ 11 (mod 16) since 43 = 16 * 2 + 11.\n\nSo, we need to find the remainder when 5^11 is divided by 17.\n\n5^11 = 48828125. Now, let's divide 48828125 by 17:\n48828125 = 2872248 * 17 + 1.\n\nTherefore, 5^11 ≡ 1 (mod 17).\n\nSo, the remainder when 73^43 is divided by 17 is 1."
