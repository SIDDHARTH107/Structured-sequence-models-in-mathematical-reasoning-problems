    "message_1": "A dairy farm produces milk, butter and cheese. The farmer has 560 liters of milk, 280 kg of butter and 630 kg of cheese available to sell. The profits per liter of milk, kg of butter and kg of cheese are $0.60, $2.80 and $3.50, respectively. How many liters of milk, kg of butter and kg of cheese should be produced to maximize profits?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profits, the farmer should produce and sell all the available milk, butter, and cheese. \n\nThe profit from selling all the milk would be:\n560 liters * $0.60/liter = $336\n\nThe profit from selling all the butter would be:\n280 kg * $2.80/kg = $784\n\nThe profit from selling all the cheese would be:\n630 kg * $3.50/kg = $2205\n\nSo, to maximize profits, the farmer should produce and sell 560 liters of milk, 280 kg of butter, and 630 kg of cheese. The total profit would be $336 + $784 + $2205 = $3325."
