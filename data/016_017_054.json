    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nIn the first iteration, the length of the curve is 1 (the initial line segment). With each subsequent iteration, the length of the curve doubles. So, after the 10th iteration, the length of the curve will be:\n\nLength = Initial length * 2^(number of iterations - 1)\nLength = 1 * 2^(10 - 1)\nLength = 1 * 2^9\nLength = 1 * 512\nLength = 512\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon Curve after the 10th iteration, starting with a line segment of length 1, is 512."
