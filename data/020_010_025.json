    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products, A and B. The cost of producing one unit of A is $10 and the cost of producing one unit of B is $15. The company wants to produce at least 50 units of A and 30 units of B. The selling price of A is $20 and the selling price of B is $25. However, due to the uncertain market conditions, the selling price for both products may drop by 40%. The company wants to optimize their profit in such a way that they can withstand the market volatility. Formulate a robust optimization problem to find the optimal production quantity for A and B, while considering the possibility of the price drop.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe cost of producing x units of A is 10x, and the cost of producing y units of B is 15y.\n\nThe revenue from selling x units of A at the normal price is 20x, and the revenue from selling y units of B at the normal price is 25y. If the selling price drops by 40%, the revenue from selling x units of A becomes 0.6 * 20x = 12x, and the revenue from selling y units of B becomes 0.6 * 25y = 15y.\n\nThe profit function for the normal selling price is:\nP(x, y) = 20x + 25y - 10x - 15y = 10x + 10y\n\nThe profit function for the reduced selling price is:\nP'(x, y) = 12x + 15y - 10x - 15y = 2x\n\nThe company wants to optimize their profit while considering the possibility of the price drop. We can formulate this as a robust optimization problem by maximizing the worst-case profit, which is the minimum of the profit functions P(x, y) and P'(x, y).\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize: min{10x + 10y, 2x}\n\nSubject to the constraints:\nx ≥ 50 (at least 50 units of A)\ny ≥ 30 (at least 30 units of B)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThis optimization problem will give the company the optimal production quantity for A and B while considering the possibility of the price drop."
