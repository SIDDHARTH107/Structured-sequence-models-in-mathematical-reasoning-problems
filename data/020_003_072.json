    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products P and Q. The total profit earned by selling one unit of P and one unit of Q is 10 and 15 dollars, respectively. The company has 1500 units of raw material A and 2000 units of raw material B available. Producing one unit of P requires 2 units of raw material A and 3 units of raw material B. Producing one unit of Q requires 1 unit of raw material A and 4 units of raw material B. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product P and y be the number of units of product Q. The objective is to maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y <= 1500 (raw material A constraint)\n3x + 4y <= 2000 (raw material B constraint)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint inequalities and finding the feasible region. Then, we will identify the corner points of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each corner point to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the constraint inequalities as equalities to plot the lines:\n\n2x + y = 1500 (raw material A constraint)\n3x + 4y = 2000 (raw material B constraint)\n\nNow, we will find the intercepts for each line:\n\nFor the raw material A constraint:\nx-intercept: y = 0, x = 750\ny-intercept: x = 0, y = 1500\n\nFor the raw material B constraint:\nx-intercept: y = 0, x = 666.67 (approx.)\ny-intercept: x = 0, y = 500\n\nPlot these lines and shade the feasible region. The corner points of the feasible region are:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 500)\nC(375, 750)\nD(666.67, 0)\n\nNow, evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\n\nProfit(A) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0\nProfit(B) = 10(0) + 15(500) = 7500\nProfit(C) = 10(375) + 15(750) = 13125\nProfit(D) = 10(666.67) + 15(0) = 6666.7 (approx.)\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C with a profit of $13,125. Therefore, the company should produce 375 units of product P and 750 units of product Q to maximize their profit."
