    "message_1": "If you are using the Playfair cipher to encrypt a message with the keyword \"MATH\", which has been condensed to \"MATHBCKDFGILNOPQRSUVWXYZ\", how many possible 2-letter combinations can be formed using the Playfair square?",
    "message_2": "The Playfair cipher uses a 5x5 grid filled with the letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is usually combined with I). In this case, the grid is filled using the keyword \"MATH\" followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet in order. The grid looks like this:\n\nM A T H B\nC K D F G\nI L N O P\nQ R S U V\nW X Y Z\n\nTo form 2-letter combinations (digraphs) using the Playfair square, you can choose any of the 25 letters in the grid for the first letter and any of the remaining 24 letters for the second letter (since the same letter cannot be repeated in a digraph). \n\nSo, the number of possible 2-letter combinations is:\n\n25 (choices for the first letter) * 24 (choices for the second letter) = 600\n\nThere are 600 possible 2-letter combinations that can be formed using the Playfair square with the keyword \"MATH\"."
