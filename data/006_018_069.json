    "message_1": "One possible question related to probability of financial fraud is the following: \n\nSuppose a company has 200 employees, and the probability that an employee commits financial fraud is 0.05. Determine the probability that at least 10 employees have committed fraud.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k employees committing fraud\n- n is the total number of employees (200 in this case)\n- k is the number of employees committing fraud (we want to find the probability of at least 10)\n- p is the probability of an employee committing fraud (0.05)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 10 employees committing fraud, we need to calculate the probability of 10, 11, 12, ..., 200 employees committing fraud and sum them up. However, it's easier to calculate the complementary probability (the probability of 0 to 9 employees committing fraud) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we will calculate the probability of 0 to 9 employees committing fraud and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 10 employees committing fraud by subtracting the complementary probability from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)\n\nCalculating the probabilities and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) ≈ 0.8171\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least 10 employees committing fraud is:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - 0.8171 ≈ 0.1829\n\nSo, there is approximately an 18.29% chance that at least 10 employees have committed fraud."
