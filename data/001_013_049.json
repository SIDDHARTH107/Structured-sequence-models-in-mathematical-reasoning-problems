    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x in the equation. Here's the equation:\n\n√(2x+1) + 3 = 7\n\nFirst, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n√(2x+1) = 4\n\nNow, square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n(√(2x+1))^2 = 4^2\n\n2x + 1 = 16\n\nNext, subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 15\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 15/2\n\nSo, x = 7.5."
