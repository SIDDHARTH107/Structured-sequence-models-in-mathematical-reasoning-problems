    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + a * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = a * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = b - (1 / (1 + (x_n^2 + y_n^2)))\n\nTo compute the Lyapunov exponent for the Ikeda map with parameter values a = 0.9184 and b = 0.3387, we need to calculate the average growth rate of small perturbations in the system over time. This can be done numerically by iterating the map for a large number of steps and computing the average of the logarithm of the Jacobian determinant.\n\nHowever, calculating the Lyapunov exponent for a specific set of parameter values requires a numerical approach, which is beyond the scope of a text-based AI. To find the Lyapunov exponent for these specific parameter values, you can use numerical methods and programming tools like Python or MATLAB to perform the calculations."
