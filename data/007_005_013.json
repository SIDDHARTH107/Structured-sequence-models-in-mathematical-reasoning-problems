    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 24 and 54 can be found by first finding the prime factors of each number and then multiplying the highest powers of each prime factor together.\n\n24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n54 = 2^1 * 3^3\n\nNow, take the highest powers of each prime factor:\n2^3 and 3^3\n\nMultiply them together:\n2^3 * 3^3 = 8 * 27 = 216\n\nSo, the LCM of 24 and 54 is 216."
