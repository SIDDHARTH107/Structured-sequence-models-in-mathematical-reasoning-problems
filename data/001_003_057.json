    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2. This will give us:\n\n4x + 6y = 22 (1)\n\nNow we have:\n\n4x + 6y = 22\n4x - 5y = -7\n\nNext, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 22 - (-7)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n11y = 29\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 29 / 11\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n2x + 3(29/11) = 11\n\nMultiply both sides by 11 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n22x + 3(29) = 121\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n22x + 87 = 121\n\nNow, subtract 87 from both sides:\n\n22x = 34\n\nFinally, divide by 22:\n\nx = 34 / 22\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 34 / 22\ny = 29 / 11"
