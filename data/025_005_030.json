    "message_2": "To find the singularity of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0 at the point (0,0,0), we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (0,0,0):\n\n∂f/∂x(0,0,0) = 3(0)^2 = 0\n∂f/∂y(0,0,0) = 3(0)^2 = 0\n∂f/∂z(0,0,0) = 3(0)^2 = 0\n\nSince all the partial derivatives are zero at the point (0,0,0), we need to investigate further to determine if this point is a singularity. We can do this by computing the second-order partial derivatives (the Hessian matrix) and checking its rank.\n\nThe second-order partial derivatives are:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 6x\n∂²f/∂y² = 6y\n∂²f/∂z² = 6z\n∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n∂²f/∂x∂z = 0\n∂²f/∂y∂z = 0\n\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n\nH(f) = | 6x  0   0  |\n       | 0   6y  0  |\n       | 0   0   6z |\n\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian matrix at the point (0,0,0):\n\nH(f)(0,0,0) = | 0  0  0 |\n              | 0  0  0 |\n              | 0  0  0 |\n\nThe rank of the Hessian matrix at the point (0,0,0) is 0, which is less than the dimension of the space (3 in this case). Therefore, the point (0,0,0) is a singularity of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0."
