    "message_2": "To decrypt the rail fence cipher with a depth of 4, we need to arrange the ciphertext in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows and then read the plaintext from left to right along the rows. The ciphertext is \"nsrletnhoia_amz_rns_ce\".\n\nFirst, let's determine the length of the ciphertext and the number of columns needed for the zigzag pattern. The length of the ciphertext is 20 characters. \n\nNow, let's arrange the ciphertext in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows:\n\nn       s       r\n  l   e t   n h\n    o i       a\n      _ a m z _ r n s _ c e\n\nReading the plaintext from left to right along the rows, we get the original message: \"no_problem_in_this_race\"."
