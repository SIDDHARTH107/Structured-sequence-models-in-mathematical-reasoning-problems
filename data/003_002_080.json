    "message_2": "In a right-angled triangle with a 30° angle, the other acute angle is 60° since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180° and one angle is already 90° (right angle). This is a 30-60-90 special triangle, which has side ratios of 1:√3:2.\n\nLet's denote the sides as follows:\n- Opposite side to the 30° angle: a\n- Adjacent side to the 30° angle: b\n- Hypotenuse: c\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side ratios are:\n- a/c = 1/2\n- b/c = √3/2\n- a/b = 1/√3\n\nNow, we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for the 30° angle:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of 30°:\nsin(30°) = opposite side / hypotenuse = a/c = 1/2\n\n2. Cosine (cos) of 30°:\ncos(30°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = b/c = √3/2\n\n3. Tangent (tan) of 30°:\ntan(30°) = opposite side / adjacent side = a/b = 1/√3 = √3/3 (by rationalizing the denominator)\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for the 30° angle are:\nsin(30°) = 1/2\ncos(30°) = √3/2\ntan(30°) = √3/3"
