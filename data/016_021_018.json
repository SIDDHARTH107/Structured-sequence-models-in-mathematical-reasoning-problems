    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal curve that is generated through a recursive process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 3/2. To find the length of the curve after the 7th iteration, starting with an initial line segment of length 1, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (3/2)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nLength = 1 * (3/2)^7\nLength = 1 * 2187/128\nLength â‰ˆ 17.0859375\n\nSo, the length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the 7th iteration is approximately 17.0859375."
