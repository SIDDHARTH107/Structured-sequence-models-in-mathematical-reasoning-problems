From a random sample of 100 customers, the mean amount spent was $50 and the standard deviation was $10. Using the bootstrapping method, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean amount spent per customer.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean amount spent per customer using the bootstrapping method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000 or more) from the original sample with replacement.\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n3. Order the bootstrap sample means from lowest to highest.\n4. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap sample means, which will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nHowever, as an AI, I am unable to perform the bootstrapping process directly. Instead, I will provide you with an alternative method to estimate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution.\n\nSince we have a sample size (n) of 100, the degrees of freedom will be n - 1 = 99. The mean amount spent (x̄) is $50, and the standard deviation (s) is $10. We can calculate the standard error (SE) using the formula:\n\nSE = s / √n\n\nSE = 10 / √100 = 10 / 10 = 1\n\nNow, we will find the t-value for a 95% confidence interval with 99 degrees of freedom. Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the t-value is approximately 1.984.\n\nFinally, we will calculate the margin of error (ME) using the formula:\n\nME = t-value * SE\n\nME = 1.984 * 1 = 1.984\n\nNow, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nLower bound = x̄ - ME = 50 - 1.984 = 48.016\nUpper bound = x̄ + ME = 50 + 1.984 = 51.984\n\nThus, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean amount spent per customer is approximately $48.016 to $51.984."
