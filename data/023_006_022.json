    "message_2": "The given function f(t) is already in the sum of sinusoids form, so we don't need to use the Fourier transform to find the frequency and strength of the two sinusoidal components. We can directly read the information from the function.\n\nf(t) = 2sin(100πt) + 3cos(200πt)\n\nThe first sinusoidal component is a sine wave with amplitude 2 and angular frequency 100π rad/s:\n\n2sin(100πt)\n\nTo find the frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nfrequency = (angular frequency) / 2π\n\nFor the first component:\n\nfrequency1 = (100π) / 2π = 50 Hz\n\nSo, the first component has a frequency of 50 Hz and a strength (magnitude) of 2.\n\nThe second sinusoidal component is a cosine wave with amplitude 3 and angular frequency 200π rad/s:\n\n3cos(200πt)\n\nFor the second component:\n\nfrequency2 = (200π) / 2π = 100 Hz\n\nSo, the second component has a frequency of 100 Hz and a strength (magnitude) of 3.\n\nIn summary, the two sinusoidal components have frequencies of 50 Hz and 100 Hz, with strengths (magnitudes) of 2 and 3, respectively."
