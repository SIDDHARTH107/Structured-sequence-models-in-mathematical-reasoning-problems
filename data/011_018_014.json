    "message_1": "In a block design, there are 7 blocks with 4 points each. Every pair of distinct points is contained in exactly one block. How many points are there in total?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the total number of points as P. Since every pair of distinct points is contained in exactly one block, we can use the concept of combinations to determine the number of pairs in each block and the total number of pairs.\n\nEach block has 4 points, so the number of pairs in each block is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = 6\n\nThere are 7 blocks, so the total number of pairs is 7 * 6 = 42.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of points P, such that every pair of distinct points is contained in exactly one block. We can use the combination formula again to find the number of pairs for P points:\n\nC(P, 2) = P! / (2! * (P - 2)!) = 42\n\nTo solve for P, we can try different values of P and see which one satisfies the equation:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = 15 (too low)\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!) = 21 (too low)\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2! * (8 - 2)!) = 28 (too low)\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2! * (9 - 2)!) = 36 (too low)\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!) = 45 (too high)\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2! * (9 - 2)!) = 36 (too low)\n\nWe can see that the value of P that satisfies the equation is not found in the above trials. However, we can notice that the total number of pairs is increasing as we increase the value of P. Since the total number of pairs is 42, we can conclude that the value of P must be between 9 and 10. \n\nLet's try the average of 9 and 10, which is 9.5. Since we cannot have half a point, we can try the closest integer values, 9 and 10:\n\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2! * (9 - 2)!) = 36 (too low)\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!) = 45 (too high)\n\nSince the total number of pairs is 42, and it is not possible to find an integer value of P that satisfies the equation, we can conclude that there is an error in the problem statement or the given conditions are not possible to satisfy."
