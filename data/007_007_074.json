    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions of the Diophantine equation 5x + 2y = 14, we can first try to find a particular solution and then use the general form of Diophantine equations to find all solutions.\n\nStep 1: Find a particular solution\nWe can start by finding a solution where x and y are both integers. One such solution is x = 2 and y = 3, since 5(2) + 2(3) = 10 + 6 = 14.\n\nStep 2: Use the general form of Diophantine equations\nThe general form of the Diophantine equation is given by:\n\nx = x0 + k * (b/gcd(a, b))\ny = y0 - k * (a/gcd(a, b))\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solution we found in step 1, a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the equation (5 and 2 in this case), gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b, and k is an integer.\n\nIn our case, gcd(5, 2) = 1, so the general form becomes:\n\nx = 2 + k * 2\ny = 3 - k * 5\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different values of k:\n\nk = 0: x = 2, y = 3 (this is the particular solution we found earlier)\nk = 1: x = 4, y = -2\nk = -1: x = 0, y = 8\nk = 2: x = 6, y = -7\nk = -2: x = -2, y = 13\n...\n\nSo, the integer solutions of the Diophantine equation 5x + 2y = 14 are given by:\n\nx = 2 + 2k\ny = 3 - 5k\n\nwhere k is an integer."
