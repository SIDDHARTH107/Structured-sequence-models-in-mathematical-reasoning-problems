    "message_2": "Let's consider a sequence of n consecutive integers, where n is an odd number. We can represent the sequence as follows:\n\nx, x+1, x+2, ..., x+(n-1)\n\nwhere x is the first integer in the sequence.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of these n consecutive integers:\n\nS = x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+(n-1))\n\nSince there are n terms in the sequence, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\nS = n * x + (1 + 2 + ... + (n-1))\n\nWe know that the sum of the first (n-1) integers is given by the formula:\n\nSum = (n-1) * n / 2\n\nSo, we can rewrite the sum S as:\n\nS = n * x + (n-1) * n / 2\n\nNow, let's factor out n from the expression:\n\nS = n * (x + (n-1) / 2)\n\nSince x and (n-1) are both integers, their sum (x + (n-1) / 2) is also an integer. Let's call this integer k:\n\nS = n * k\n\nThis shows that the sum S of any odd number of consecutive integers is always a multiple of the number of integers (n) in the sequence. In the example given, the sum of any 5 consecutive integers is always a multiple of 5."
