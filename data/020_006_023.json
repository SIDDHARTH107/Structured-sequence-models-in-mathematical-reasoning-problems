    "message_1": "A toy manufacturer produces two types of toys, cars and dolls. Each car requires 2 hours of labor and $4 of raw materials to produce, while each doll requires 1 hour of labor and $3 of raw materials. The manufacturer has 80 hours of labor and $120 of raw materials available per day. However, due to a contractual agreement, the manufacturer is only allowed to produce a maximum of 20 dolls per day. What is the maximum profit that the manufacturer can make per day if the profit from each car sold is $10 and the profit from each doll sold is $7?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of cars produced and y be the number of dolls produced.\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw materials can be written as:\n2x + y ≤ 80 (labor constraint)\n4x + 3y ≤ 120 (raw materials constraint)\n\nAdditionally, we have the constraint for the maximum number of dolls produced per day:\ny ≤ 20\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 10x + 7y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 80\ny ≤ -2x + 80\n\n2. 4x + 3y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (-4/3)x + 40\n\n3. y ≤ 20\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0,0), (0,20), (20,20), (30,0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 10(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(0,20) = 10(0) + 7(20) = 140\n3. P(20,20) = 10(20) + 7(20) = 340\n4. P(30,0) = 10(30) + 7(0) = 300\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20,20), with a profit of $340 per day."
