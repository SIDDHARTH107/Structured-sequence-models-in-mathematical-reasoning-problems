    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will first analyze the possible structure of G using the Sylow theorems and then determine its multiplication table. Finally, we will find its possible isomorphisms with the given groups.\n\nSince G has order 8, it has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is equal to 1 (mod 2) and divides the order of G, which is 8. Thus, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which must be G itself. This means G is a 2-group, and its structure can be either cyclic or non-cyclic.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic\nIf G is cyclic, then it is generated by a single element of order 8, say g. Then G = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is isomorphic to C8, the cyclic group of order 8.\n\nCase 2: G is non-cyclic\nIf G is non-cyclic, then no element in G has order 8. Since G is a 2-group, the possible orders of its elements are 1, 2, and 4. The identity element has order 1, and there must be at least one element of order 4, say a. Then G contains {e, a, a^2, a^3}. Since G is non-cyclic, a^2 has order 2. Let b be an element in G not in {e, a, a^2, a^3}. Then b has order 2 or 4.\n\nIf b has order 4, then G is generated by a and b, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, which has elements {e, a, a^2, a^3, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b} and relations a^4 = b^2 = e and ba = a^3b.\n\nIf b has order 2, then G has three elements of order 2: a^2, b, and ab. The group G is then isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8, which has elements {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} and relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\n\nIn summary, if G is a group of order 8, it must be isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4. To determine which of these groups G is isomorphic to, one can construct the multiplication table for G and compare it to the multiplication tables of C8, Q8, and D4. The isomorphism will be determined by the structure of G and the orders of its elements."
