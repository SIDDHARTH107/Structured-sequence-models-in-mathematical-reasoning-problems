    "message_2": "To find all the points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 3$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$, we will plug in all possible values of $x$ from $0$ to $6$ (since we are working in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$) and check if there exists a corresponding $y$ value such that the equation holds true.\n\nFor each $x$, we will compute $x^3 + 3x + 3$ and check if it is a quadratic residue modulo $7$. If it is, then we can find the corresponding $y$ values.\n\n1. For $x = 0$:\n$y^2 = 0^3 + 3(0) + 3 = 3$. The quadratic residues modulo $7$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 4\\}$, so $3$ is not a quadratic residue. There are no points with $x = 0$.\n\n2. For $x = 1$:\n$y^2 = 1^3 + 3(1) + 3 = 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, $y^2 = 0$, and the only solution is $y = 0$. So, we have one point: $(1, 0)$.\n\n3. For $x = 2$:\n$y^2 = 2^3 + 3(2) + 3 = 17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. As we saw before, $3$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $7$. There are no points with $x = 2$.\n\n4. For $x = 3$:\n$y^2 = 3^3 + 3(3) + 3 = 36 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, $y^2 = 1$, and the solutions are $y = 1$ and $y = 6$. So, we have two points: $(3, 1)$ and $(3, 6)$.\n\n5. For $x = 4$:\n$y^2 = 4^3 + 3(4) + 3 = 79 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, $y^2 = 2$, and the solutions are $y = 3$ and $y = 4$. So, we have two points: $(4, 3)$ and $(4, 4)$.\n\n6. For $x = 5$:\n$y^2 = 5^3 + 3(5) + 3 = 133 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, $y^2 = 0$, and the only solution is $y = 0$. So, we have one point: $(5, 0)$.\n\n7. For $x = 6$:\n$y^2 = 6^3 + 3(6) + 3 = 225 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, $y^2 = 1$, and the solutions are $y = 1$ and $y = 6$. So, we have two points: $(6, 1)$ and $(6, 6)$.\n\nIn summary, the points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 3$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$ are:\n$(1, 0)$, $(3, 1)$, $(3, 6)$, $(4, 3)$, $(4, 4)$, $(5, 0)$, $(6, 1)$, and $(6, 6)$."
