    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. The Borsuk-Ulam theorem states that for any continuous map g: S^n → R^n, where S^n is the n-dimensional sphere, there exists a point x ∈ S^n such that g(x) = g(-x).\n\nFirst, we need to find a way to relate the smooth manifold M of dimension 2 to the 2-dimensional sphere S^2. We can do this by embedding M into R^3. Since M is a 2-dimensional manifold, we can find a smooth embedding φ: M → R^3 such that the image of M under φ is a compact, connected, and orientable surface in R^3.\n\nNow, let's consider the unit sphere S^2 in R^3. We can find a smooth map Φ: M → S^2 such that Φ(p) = (φ(p) - c)/||φ(p) - c|| for some point c ∈ R^3. Intuitively, this map projects the points of M onto the unit sphere S^2 centered at c.\n\nNext, we define a continuous map g: S^2 → R as g(x) = f(Φ^(-1)(x)). Note that g is well-defined since Φ is a smooth map and has a smooth inverse on its image.\n\nNow, we can apply the Borsuk-Ulam theorem to the map g. There exists a point x ∈ S^2 such that g(x) = g(-x). In other words, f(Φ^(-1)(x)) = f(Φ^(-1)(-x)). Let p = Φ^(-1)(x) and q = Φ^(-1)(-x). Then, we have f(p) = f(q), as desired.\n\nThus, there always exist two points p, q ∈ M with the same image under the smooth map f: M → R."
