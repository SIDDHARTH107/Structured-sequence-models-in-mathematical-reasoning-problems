Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n    | 1  1.5  2 |  6\n    | 0  0   -6 | -16\n    | 0  0    0 |  0\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -6 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n    | 1  1.5  2 |  6\n    | 0  0    1 |  2.67\n    | 0  0    0 |  0\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the third column above the second row. Subtract 2 times the second row from the first row:\n\n    | 1  1.5  0 |  0.67\n    | 0  0    1 |  2.67\n    | 0  0    0 |  0\n\nNow we can read the solution from the matrix:\n\nx = 0.67\ny is a free variable, so y = t (where t is any real number)\nz = 2.67\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 0.67\ny = t\nz = 2.67"
