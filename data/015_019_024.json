    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the Henon-Heiles potential, we need to find the critical points of the potential energy function, V(q1, q2) = q1^2*q2 - (1/3)*q2^3 - q1^2, and then determine the maximum value among those critical points.\n\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives of V with respect to q1 and q2:\n\n∂V/∂q1 = 2*q1*q2 - 2*q1 = 2*q1*(q2 - 1)\n∂V/∂q2 = q1^2 - q2^2\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives to zero and solve for q1 and q2:\n\n2*q1*(q2 - 1) = 0\nq1^2 - q2^2 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we have two possibilities: q1 = 0 or q2 = 1.\n\n1) If q1 = 0, then from the second equation, we have -q2^2 = 0, which implies q2 = 0. So, one critical point is (0, 0).\n\n2) If q2 = 1, then from the second equation, we have q1^2 - 1^2 = 0, which implies q1 = ±1. So, we have two more critical points: (1, 1) and (-1, 1).\n\nNow, we evaluate the potential energy function V at these critical points:\n\nV(0, 0) = 0^2*0 - (1/3)*0^3 - 0^2 = 0\nV(1, 1) = 1^2*1 - (1/3)*1^3 - 1^2 = 1 - (1/3) - 1 = -1/3\nV(-1, 1) = (-1)^2*1 - (1/3)*1^3 - (-1)^2 = 1 - (1/3) - 1 = -1/3\n\nThe maximum value of the Henon-Heiles potential is V(0, 0) = 0."
