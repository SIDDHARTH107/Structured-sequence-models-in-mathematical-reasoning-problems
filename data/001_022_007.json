    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept of a polynomial function, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\n2x^3 - 6x^2 - 18x + 20 = 0\n\nFirst, we can factor out a 2 from each term:\n\n2(x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 10) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the cubic equation inside the parentheses:\n\nx^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 10 = 0\n\nThis cubic equation does not have an obvious factorization, so we can use numerical methods or graphing tools to find the roots. Using a graphing calculator or an online tool, we find that the real root is approximately x â‰ˆ 1.816.\n\nSo, the x-intercept of the polynomial function is approximately (1.816, 0)."
