    "message_1": "Suppose the height of a certain population follows a normal distribution with a mean of 68 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If a sample of 36 individuals is taken, what is the probability that the sample mean height is greater than 69 inches?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean for a large enough sample size (n ≥ 30) will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying population distribution.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 68 inches, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 3 inches. The sample size (n) is 36 individuals.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (μx̄) is equal to the population mean (μ):\n\nμx̄ = μ = 68 inches\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (σx̄) is equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n):\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n = 3 / √36 = 3 / 6 = 0.5 inches\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean height is greater than 69 inches. To do this, we will calculate the z-score corresponding to a sample mean of 69 inches:\n\nz = (x̄ - μx̄) / σx̄ = (69 - 68) / 0.5 = 1 / 0.5 = 2\n\nA z-score of 2 means that the sample mean of 69 inches is 2 standard deviations above the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean.\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 2. The value corresponding to a z-score of 2 in the z-table is 0.9772. This value represents the probability that the z-score is less than 2. To find the probability that the z-score is greater than 2, we subtract this value from 1:\n\nP(z > 2) = 1 - P(z < 2) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean height is greater than 69 inches is approximately 0.0228, or 2.28%."
