The associative property states that (A x B) x C = A x (B x C) for any sets A, B, and C.\n\nTo show this, we need to demonstrate that each element in (A x B) x B can be mapped to a corresponding element in A x (B x B) and vice versa.\n\nConsider an element in (A x B) x B: ((a, b), c), where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ B. We can rewrite this element as (a, (b, c)), where a ∈ A, and (b, c) ∈ B x B. This element is in A x (B x B).\n\nSimilarly, consider an element in A x (B x B): (a, (b, c)), where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ B. We can rewrite this element as ((a, b), c), where (a, b) ∈ A x B, and c ∈ B. This element is in (A x B) x B.\n\nSince we can map each element in (A x B) x B to a corresponding element in A x (B x B) and vice versa, we can conclude that (A x B) x B = A x (B x B) using the associative property of the Cartesian product."
