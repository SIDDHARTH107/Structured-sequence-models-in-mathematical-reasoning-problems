The general solution of the equation can be written as:\n\n$$u(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) $u(0) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) \\Rightarrow A = 0$$\n\nSo, the solution becomes:\n\n$$u(x) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\n2) $u(1) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda})$$\n\nSince we are looking for a nontrivial solution, $B \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have:\n\n$$\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 0$$\n\nThis occurs when $\\sqrt{\\lambda} = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.
