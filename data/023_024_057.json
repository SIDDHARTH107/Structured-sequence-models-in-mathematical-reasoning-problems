    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of f(x) using complex exponential form, we first need to find the complex Fourier coefficients, c_n. The formula for c_n is given by:\n\nc_n = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) * e^(-inx/T)] dx, where T is the period of the function, n is an integer, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nFor our function f(x), the period T = 2π. We will compute the integral separately for the two cases of f(x):\n\n1. For 0 < x < π, f(x) = 1:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) * ∫[e^(-inx/2π)] dx from 0 to π\n\n2. For -π < x < 0, f(x) = -1:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) * ∫[-e^(-inx/2π)] dx from -π to 0\n\nNow, we will compute the integrals:\n\n1. ∫[e^(-inx/2π)] dx = (-2πi/n) * e^(-inx/2π) + C, where C is the constant of integration\n\nEvaluating the integral from 0 to π:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) * [(-2πi/n) * (e^(-inπ) - 1)]\n\n2. ∫[-e^(-inx/2π)] dx = (2πi/n) * e^(-inx/2π) + C, where C is the constant of integration\n\nEvaluating the integral from -π to 0:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) * [(2πi/n) * (1 - e^(inπ))]\n\nNow, we sum the two cases:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) * [(-2πi/n) * (e^(-inπ) - 1) + (2πi/n) * (1 - e^(inπ))]\n\nSimplifying:\n\nc_n = (-i/n) * (e^(-inπ) - 1) + (i/n) * (1 - e^(inπ))\n\nc_n = (i/n) * (e^(inπ) - e^(-inπ))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x) using complex exponential form:\n\nf(x) = Σ[c_n * e^(inx/2π)]\n\nf(x) = Σ[(i/n) * (e^(inπ) - e^(-inπ)) * e^(inx/2π)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of f(x) using complex exponential form. Note that c_0 = 0 in this case, so the summation starts from n = 1."
