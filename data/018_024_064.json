    "message_2": "First, let's find the complements of A and B. Since we are not given a universal set, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B. Therefore, U = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nNow, we can find the complements of A and B with respect to U:\nA' (complement of A) = U - A = {4}\nB' (complement of B) = U - B = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between the complement of A and B, and the complement of B and A.\n\nThe symmetric difference between two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nSymmetric difference between A' and B: (A' ∪ B) - (A' ∩ B)\n(A' ∪ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n(A' ∩ B) = {}\nSo, the symmetric difference between A' and B is {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nSymmetric difference between B' and A: (B' ∪ A) - (B' ∩ A)\n(B' ∪ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n(B' ∩ A) = {1}\nSo, the symmetric difference between B' and A is {2, 3, 4}.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between these two symmetric differences:\nSymmetric difference between ({1, 2, 3, 4}) and ({2, 3, 4}) = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4})\n({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n({1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4}) = {2, 3, 4}\nSo, the symmetric difference between the two symmetric differences is {1}.\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement. If it is distributive, then the following equation should hold:\n\n(A' Δ B) Δ (B' Δ A) = (A' Δ B') Δ (A Δ B)\n\nWe already found that (A' Δ B) Δ (B' Δ A) = {1}. Now let's find (A' Δ B') Δ (A Δ B):\n\nA' Δ B' = ({4} ∪ {1}) - ({4} ∩ {1}) = {1, 4}\nA Δ B = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 4}) = {1, 4}\n(A' Δ B') Δ (A Δ B) = ({1, 4} ∪ {1, 4}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {1, 4}) = {1, 4}\n\nSince (A' Δ B) Δ (B' Δ A) = {1} and (A' Δ B') Δ (A Δ B) = {1, 4}, the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
