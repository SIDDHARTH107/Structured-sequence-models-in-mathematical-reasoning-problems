    "message_2": "First, let's find the two possible values of z when f(z) = 3.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\nf(z) = z^2 + 1 = 3\n\nz^2 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the two possible values of z:\n\nz = ±√2\n\nNow, let's find the two possible values of f(i) using these values of z.\n\nCase 1: z = √2\n\nf(z) = (√2)^2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nCase 2: z = -√2\n\nf(z) = (-√2)^2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nIn both cases, f(i) = 3. However, the problem states that z ≠ i. Since f(i) = 3 for both possible values of z, there must be an error in the problem statement. The function f(z) = z^2 + 1 is actually analytic everywhere on the complex plane, including at the point z = i."
