    "message_2": "To find the integral of the function (sin x + cos x) over the interval [0, π/2], we first need to find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe antiderivative of sin x is -cos x, and the antiderivative of cos x is sin x. So, the antiderivative of (sin x + cos x) is:\n\nF(x) = -cos x + sin x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate F(x) at the limits of the interval [0, π/2]:\n\nF(π/2) = -cos(π/2) + sin(π/2)\nF(0) = -cos(0) + sin(0)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1, so F(π/2) = -0 + 1 = 1\ncos(0) = 1 and sin(0) = 0, so F(0) = -1 + 0 = -1\n\nNow, we subtract F(0) from F(π/2) to find the definite integral:\n\n∫ (sin x + cos x) dx from 0 to π/2 = F(π/2) - F(0) = 1 - (-1) = 2"
