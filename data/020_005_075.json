    "message_1": "A company wants to optimize its production using integer programming. They want to produce two products, A and B. The production of each product requires two machines, X and Y. Machine X is available for 45 hours and machine Y is available for 30 hours per week. Product A earns a profit of $10 per unit, while product B earns a profit of $12 per unit. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of machine X and 1 hour of machine Y, while each unit of product B requires 1 hour of machine X and 2 hours of machine Y. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit, and what is the maximum profit they can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 12y, subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 45 (Machine X availability)\nx + 2y ≤ 30 (Machine Y availability)\nx, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity)\n\nWe can start by solving the constraints for the boundary points of the feasible region:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 0 (origin)\n2. x = 0, 2y = 30 => y = 15\n3. 2x + y = 45, x + 2y = 30 => x = 15, y = 0\n4. 2x + y = 45, x + 2y = 30 => x = 5, y = 10\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at these boundary points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 15) = 10(0) + 12(15) = $180\n3. P(15, 0) = 10(15) + 12(0) = $150\n4. P(5, 10) = 10(5) + 12(10) = $170\n\nThe maximum profit is $180, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 15 units of product B."
