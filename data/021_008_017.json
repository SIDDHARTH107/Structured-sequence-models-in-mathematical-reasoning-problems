    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to a system of two non-linear equations, we need to find the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nwhere f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 10 and f2(x, y) = xy + x - y + 1.\n\nCalculating the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = 2y\n∂f2/∂x = y + 1\n∂f2/∂y = x - 1\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x   2y |\n          | y+1  x-1 |\n\nNow we need to find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\nJ^(-1) = (1/det(J)) * |  d  -b |\n                      | -c   a |\n\nwhere det(J) = ad - bc, and a, b, c, and d are the elements of the Jacobian matrix.\n\nIn our case, a = 2x, b = 2y, c = y+1, and d = x-1. So det(J) = (2x)(x-1) - (2y)(y+1).\n\nThe inverse of the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ^(-1) = (1/det(J)) * |  x-1  -2y  |\n                      | -y-1   2x  |\n\nNow we can apply Newton's method using the initial approximation (x0, y0) = (1, 2):\n\n(x1, y1) = (x0, y0) - J^(-1)(x0, y0) * F(x0, y0)\n\nwhere F(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)).\n\nF(1, 2) = (1^2 + 2^2 - 10, 1*2 + 1 - 2 + 1) = (-5, 2)\n\nNow we need to evaluate J^(-1)(1, 2):\n\ndet(J) = (2*1)(1-1) - (2*2)(2+1) = -12\n\nJ^(-1)(1, 2) = (1/-12) * |  0  -4  |\n                        | -3   2  |\n\nNow we can find (x1, y1):\n\n(x1, y1) = (1, 2) - J^(-1)(1, 2) * F(1, 2)\n\n(x1, y1) = (1, 2) - (1/-12) * |  0  -4  | * (-5, 2)\n          = (1, 2) - (1/-12) * (8, -10)\n          = (1, 2) + (2/3, -5/6)\n          = (5/3, 7/6)\n\nRounding to three decimal places, we get (x1, y1) ≈ (1.667, 1.167).\n\nThis is the first iteration of Newton's method. You can continue iterating to get a more accurate approximation of the root."
