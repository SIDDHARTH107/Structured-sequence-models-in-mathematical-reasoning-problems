    "message_2": "To find the complement of a fuzzy set A, denoted as A', we need to calculate the membership function of A' for each element in the universe of discourse X. The membership function of the complement of A is given by:\n\nμA'(x) = 1 - μA(x)\n\nSince μA(x) = x/10, we can calculate μA'(x) for each element in X:\n\nμA'(0) = 1 - (0/10) = 1\nμA'(1) = 1 - (1/10) = 9/10\nμA'(2) = 1 - (2/10) = 8/10\nμA'(3) = 1 - (3/10) = 7/10\nμA'(4) = 1 - (4/10) = 6/10\nμA'(5) = 1 - (5/10) = 5/10\nμA'(6) = 1 - (6/10) = 4/10\nμA'(7) = 1 - (7/10) = 3/10\nμA'(8) = 1 - (8/10) = 2/10\nμA'(9) = 1 - (9/10) = 1/10\n\nSo, the complement of A, A', has the following membership function:\n\nμA'(x) = {1, 9/10, 8/10, 7/10, 6/10, 5/10, 4/10, 3/10, 2/10, 1/10}"
