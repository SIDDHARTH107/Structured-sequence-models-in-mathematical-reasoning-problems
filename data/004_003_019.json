    "message_1": "A rectangular box with a square base and no lid is to be made from a piece of cardboard of dimensions 24 inches by 36 inches by cutting out equal squares from each corner and folding up the sides. What is the maximum volume of the box that can be made using this method?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner. After cutting out the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 36 - 2x\nWidth: 24 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume of the box, V, can be calculated as:\n\nV = length × width × height\nV = (36 - 2x)(24 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we can take the derivative of the volume function with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\ndV/dx = 0\n\nFirst, expand the volume function:\n\nV = 4x^3 - 120x^2 + 864x\n\nNow, find the derivative:\n\ndV/dx = 12x^2 - 240x + 864\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n12x^2 - 240x + 864 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 12:\n\nx^2 - 20x + 72 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 6)(x - 12) = 0\n\nThe possible values for x are 6 and 12. However, since the width of the cardboard is 24 inches, cutting out squares of side length 12 inches would result in a box with no width. Therefore, x = 6 inches is the optimal side length of the squares to be cut out.\n\nNow, find the dimensions of the box:\n\nLength: 36 - 2(6) = 24 inches\nWidth: 24 - 2(6) = 12 inches\nHeight: 6 inches\n\nFinally, calculate the maximum volume:\n\nV = 24 × 12 × 6 = 1728 cubic inches"
