    "message_1": "As deontic logic deals with permissions and obligations, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a class of 25 students, the teacher grants permission to 5 students to use calculators during an exam. If each student is obligated to pass the exam with a minimum of 70%, how many students must pass the exam without using calculators?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem:\n\nThere are 25 students in total. Out of these, 5 students are allowed to use calculators. So, there are 25 - 5 = 20 students who are not allowed to use calculators.\n\nSince each student is obligated to pass the exam with a minimum of 70%, all 25 students must pass the exam, including those who are not using calculators.\n\nTherefore, 20 students must pass the exam without using calculators."
