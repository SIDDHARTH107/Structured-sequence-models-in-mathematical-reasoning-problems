The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection of (A Δ B) and {3, 4, 5, 6}:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {6}\n\nSo, the final answer is {6}."
