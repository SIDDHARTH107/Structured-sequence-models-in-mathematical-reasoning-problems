    "message_1": "If a relevance logic has 6 possible truth values, how many possible truth tables are there for this logic?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible truth tables for a relevance logic with 6 possible truth values, we need to consider the number of possible combinations of truth values for each input pair.\n\nFor a binary operation, there are two inputs (A and B), and each input can have one of the 6 possible truth values. Therefore, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible input pairs.\n\nFor each of these 36 input pairs, there is a corresponding output, which can also have one of the 6 possible truth values. So, for each input pair, there are 6 possible output values.\n\nTo find the total number of possible truth tables, we need to calculate the number of ways to assign one of the 6 possible output values to each of the 36 input pairs. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose 6 values for each of the 36 input pairs, which is 6^36.\n\nSo, there are 6^36 possible truth tables for a relevance logic with 6 possible truth values."
