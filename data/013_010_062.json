    "message_1": "Consider a market with two firms A and B producing identical goods. Each firm has a fixed cost of $1000 and the total market demand is P = 300 - Q, where Q is the sum of the quantities produced by A and B. Using the Cournot competition model, find out the amount produced by each firm and the market price if they choose their quantities simultaneously. Assume both firms have constant marginal cost of $20 per unit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow the Cournot competition model, which assumes that each firm chooses its quantity, taking the quantity of the other firm as given. We will find the reaction functions for both firms and then solve for the equilibrium quantities and market price.\n\nStep 1: Find the inverse demand function\nThe inverse demand function is given by P = 300 - Q, where Q is the total quantity produced by both firms (Q = qA + qB).\n\nStep 2: Find the profit functions for both firms\nThe profit function for firm A is given by:\nπA = (P * qA) - (20 * qA) - 1000\nSubstitute the inverse demand function into the profit function:\nπA = ((300 - Q) * qA) - (20 * qA) - 1000\nπA = ((300 - (qA + qB)) * qA) - (20 * qA) - 1000\n\nSimilarly, the profit function for firm B is given by:\nπB = (P * qB) - (20 * qB) - 1000\nπB = ((300 - Q) * qB) - (20 * qB) - 1000\nπB = ((300 - (qA + qB)) * qB) - (20 * qB) - 1000\n\nStep 3: Find the reaction functions for both firms\nTo find the reaction function for firm A, we will take the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to qA and set it equal to zero:\n\ndπA/dqA = (300 - qA - qB) - 20 - qA = 0\n2qA + qB = 280\n\nThe reaction function for firm A is:\nqA = (280 - qB)/2\n\nSimilarly, for firm B:\ndπB/dqB = (300 - qA - qB) - 20 - qB = 0\nqA + 2qB = 280\n\nThe reaction function for firm B is:\nqB = (280 - qA)/2\n\nStep 4: Solve for the equilibrium quantities\nNow we will solve the reaction functions simultaneously to find the equilibrium quantities:\n\nqA = (280 - qB)/2\nqB = (280 - qA)/2\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first equation:\nqA = (280 - ((280 - qA)/2))/2\n\nSolve for qA:\nqA = (280 - 140 + qA/2)/2\nqA = (140 + qA/2)/2\n2qA = 140 + qA/2\n4qA = 280 + qA\n3qA = 280\nqA = 280/3 ≈ 93.33\n\nNow substitute qA back into the reaction function for qB:\nqB = (280 - qA)/2\nqB = (280 - 93.33)/2 ≈ 93.33\n\nSo, in the Cournot equilibrium, both firms produce approximately 93.33 units each.\n\nStep 5: Find the market price\nNow we can find the market price using the inverse demand function:\nP = 300 - Q\nP = 300 - (qA + qB)\nP = 300 - (93.33 + 93.33)\nP ≈ 113.34\n\nThus, in the Cournot equilibrium, both firms produce approximately 93.33 units each, and the market price is approximately $113.34."
