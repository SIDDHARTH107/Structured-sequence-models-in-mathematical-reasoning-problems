    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B, using the Cartesian product. Then, find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A, using the same method. Show that the results are not equal, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In this case, A Δ B = {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A Δ B with A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A Δ B) x A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\n(A Δ B) x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A. In this case, B Δ A = {1, 4} (which is the same as A Δ B).\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B Δ A with B and A.\n\n(B Δ A) x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\n(B Δ A) x A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the Cartesian products (A Δ B) x A and (B Δ A) x B are equal, and the Cartesian products (A Δ B) x B and (B Δ A) x A are also equal. This means that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative with respect to the Cartesian product, contrary to the original claim."
