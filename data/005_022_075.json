    "message_2": "First, we need to order the data set from smallest to largest:\n\n5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20\n\nNow, let's find the median (Q2), which is the middle value. Since there are 10 numbers, the median will be the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th):\n\n(11 + 12) / 2 = 11.5\n\nNext, let's find the first quartile (Q1), which is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the median if the data set has an odd number of values). In this case, the lower half is:\n\n5, 8, 9, 10, 11\n\nThe median of the lower half (Q1) is 9.\n\nFinally, let's find the third quartile (Q3), which is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the median if the data set has an odd number of values). In this case, the upper half is:\n\n12, 13, 14, 15, 20\n\nThe median of the upper half (Q3) is 14.\n\nSo, the median (Q2) is 11.5, the first quartile (Q1) is 9, and the third quartile (Q3) is 14."
