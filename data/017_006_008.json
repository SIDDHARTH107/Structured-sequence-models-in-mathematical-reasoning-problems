    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 35, we know that |G| = 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are distinct prime numbers. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet's find the Sylow 5-subgroup and Sylow 7-subgroup of G. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they must be normal in G. Let H be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup and K be the unique Sylow 7-subgroup. Then, |H| = 5 and |K| = 7.\n\nSince H and K are both normal in G, we can form the direct product of H and K, denoted by H x K. By the definition of the direct product, |H x K| = |H| * |K| = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nNow, we have a group H x K of order 35, and G is also a group of order 35. Since both G and H x K have the same order and are formed by the direct product of their Sylow subgroups, G must be isomorphic to H x K.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
