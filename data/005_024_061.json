The data set shows the following values: 12, 17, 14, 20, 10, 18, 21, 25, 14, 27, 16, 13, 15, 12, 20, 18, 16, 22, 19, 16, 23, 18, 14, 17, 16, 21, 19, 17, 15, and 20. \n\nIf the company wants to estimate the average number of products sold per day for the next month with a 95% confidence level, what is the margin of error for their estimation?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the margin of error for the estimation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean (average) of the data set.\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of the data set.\n3. Determine the critical value (z-score) for a 95% confidence level.\n4. Calculate the margin of error using the formula: Margin of Error = (Critical Value * Standard Deviation) / sqrt(sample size)\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Mean (average):\n(12 + 17 + 14 + 20 + 10 + 18 + 21 + 25 + 14 + 27 + 16 + 13 + 15 + 12 + 20 + 18 + 16 + 22 + 19 + 16 + 23 + 18 + 14 + 17 + 16 + 21 + 19 + 17 + 15 + 20) / 30 = 17.2\n\n2. Standard Deviation:\nFirst, calculate the variance:\n[(12-17.2)^2 + (17-17.2)^2 + ... + (20-17.2)^2] / 30 = 24.96\nNow, take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation:\nsqrt(24.96) ≈ 4.996\n\n3. Critical Value (z-score) for a 95% confidence level:\nFor a 95% confidence level, the critical value (z-score) is 1.96.\n\n4. Margin of Error:\nMargin of Error = (1.96 * 4.996) / sqrt(30) ≈ 1.78\n\nTherefore, the margin of error for their estimation with a 95% confidence level is approximately 1.78."
