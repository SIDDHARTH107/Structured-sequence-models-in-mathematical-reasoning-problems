    "message_2": "A Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The perimeter of a Koch island at any iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of sides) * (4/3)^iteration\n\nFor the 4th iteration with an initial side length of 2 units, the perimeter would be:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * 3 * (4/3)^4\nPerimeter = 6 * (256/81)\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 18.963\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island at the 4th iteration with an initial side length of 2 units is approximately 18.963 units."
