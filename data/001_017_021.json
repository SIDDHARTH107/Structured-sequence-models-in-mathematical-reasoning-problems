    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+4) - log(x-1) = log(10), we will use the properties of logarithms.\n\n1. Combine the logarithms on the left side of the equation using the quotient rule: log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)\n\nlog((x+4)/(x-1)) = log(10)\n\n2. Since the logarithms are equal, their arguments must also be equal:\n\n(x+4)/(x-1) = 10\n\n3. Now, solve for x:\n\n(x+4) = 10(x-1)\n\nx + 4 = 10x - 10\n\n4 + 10 = 10x - x\n\n14 = 9x\n\nx = 14/9\n\nSo, x = 14/9."
