    "message_2": "To find the degree of the divisor $D$, we need to sum the coefficients of the points in the divisor. In this case, the divisor $D$ is given by $3\\cdot(1, 0) + (0, 0) - 4\\cdot(\\infty)$. The coefficients are 3, 1, and -4.\n\nSo, the degree of the divisor $D$ is:\n\n$3 + 1 - 4 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the degree of the divisor $D$ on the curve $C$ is 0."
