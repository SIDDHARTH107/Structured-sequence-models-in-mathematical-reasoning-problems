    "message_2": "To find the coefficients of the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x), we first need to compute the Fourier transform itself. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[f(x) * e^(-ikx) dx], where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = ψ(x) = e^(-3x^2/2) + e^(-x^2/2). So, we need to compute the Fourier transform of each term separately and then add them together.\n\nLet's compute the Fourier transform of the first term:\n\nF1(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[e^(-3x^2/2) * e^(-ikx) dx]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫[e^(-ax^2) * e^(bx) dx] = √(π/a) * e^(b^2/(4a)), where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nApplying this formula to our integral, we get:\n\nF1(k) = (1/√(2π)) * √(π/(3/2)) * e^(-k^2/(4*(3/2)))\n\nNow, let's compute the Fourier transform of the second term:\n\nF2(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[e^(-x^2/2) * e^(-ikx) dx]\n\nApplying the Gaussian integral formula again, we get:\n\nF2(k) = (1/√(2π)) * √(π/(1/2)) * e^(-k^2/(4*(1/2)))\n\nNow, we can add F1(k) and F2(k) to get the Fourier transform of ψ(x):\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k) = (1/√(2π)) * (√(2π/3) * e^(-k^2/4) + √(2π) * e^(-3k^2/4))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nF(k) = √(2/3) * e^(-k^2/4) + e^(-3k^2/4)\n\nSo, the coefficients of the Fourier transform of ψ(x) are:\n\nA1 = √(2/3) and A2 = 1, with the corresponding exponentials e^(-k^2/4) and e^(-3k^2/4)."
