    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to approximate the dominant eigenvector of a matrix. The algorithm starts with an initial vector and repeatedly multiplies it by the matrix until the eigenvector converges to a fixed point. Here's the algorithm applied to the given matrix A and initial vector [1, 1]:\n\nMatrix A:\n[[ 1, -2],\n [-4,  3]]\n\nInitial vector v0:\n[1, 1]\n\n1st iteration:\nv1 = A * v0 = [[1, -2], [-4, 3]] * [1, 1] = [-1, -1]\n\n2nd iteration:\nv2 = A * v1 = [[1, -2], [-4, 3]] * [-1, -1] = [3, 7]\n\nNormalize v2:\nv2_normalized = [3/sqrt(58), 7/sqrt(58)] ≈ [0.394, 0.919]\n\n3rd iteration:\nv3 = A * v2_normalized ≈ [[1, -2], [-4, 3]] * [0.394, 0.919] ≈ [1.440, 3.394]\n\nNormalize v3:\nv3_normalized = [1.440/sqrt(13.076), 3.394/sqrt(13.076)] ≈ [0.399, 0.917]\n\nSince the difference between v2_normalized and v3_normalized is less than 0.001 for each component, we can stop the iteration here.\n\nApproximate dominant eigenvector:\nv ≈ [0.399, 0.917]\n\nTo find the corresponding eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue λ ≈ (v^T * A * v) / (v^T * v)\nλ ≈ ([0.399, 0.917] * [[1, -2], [-4, 3]] * [0.399, 0.917]) / ([0.399, 0.917] * [0.399, 0.917])\nλ ≈ 5.000\n\nSo, the approximate dominant eigenvalue is 5.000, and the corresponding eigenvector is [0.399, 0.917]."
