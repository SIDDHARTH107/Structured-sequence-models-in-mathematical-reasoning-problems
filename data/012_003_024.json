    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. In this graph, the maximum number of nodes that can be included in an independent set is 4. One possible independent set is {1, 4, 5, 6}. No two vertices in this set are adjacent, and it is not possible to include more nodes without violating the adjacency condition."
