    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4. We will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where G has an element of order 4. Let a ∈ G be an element of order 4. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, ⟨a⟩, has order 4, which means that G = ⟨a⟩. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G does not have an element of order 4. In this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let a, b ∈ G be two distinct non-identity elements. Since both a and b have order 2, we have a^2 = e and b^2 = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the element ab ∈ G. Since G has only 4 elements, and a, b, and e are already accounted for, we must have ab = c, where c is the remaining element in G. Note that c ≠ a and c ≠ b, as a and b are distinct non-identity elements.\n\nNow, let's compute (ab)^2. We have (ab)^2 = abab. Since G is a group, it satisfies the associative property, so we can rewrite this as (ab)(ab). We want to show that (ab)^2 = e.\n\nWe know that a^2 = e and b^2 = e. Therefore, we can rewrite abab as aeaebb. Since ae = a and eb = b, we have abab = ab. Thus, (ab)^2 = ab = c, which implies that c^2 = e, as c = ab.\n\nNow, we have shown that all non-identity elements of G have order 2. Moreover, the elements of G are {e, a, b, c}, with the property that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. This is precisely the definition of the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 4, it is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
