    "message_2": "A meromorphic function is a function that is holomorphic (analytic) on its domain except for a set of isolated singular points, which are poles. In other words, a meromorphic function is a function that can be locally represented as the quotient of two holomorphic functions.\n\nf(z) = 2z^3 - z^2 + 5z - 7 is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are holomorphic on the entire complex plane. Since f(z) has no singular points or poles, it is not a meromorphic function in the strict sense. However, it can be considered as a meromorphic function with no poles, as it is holomorphic everywhere.\n\nIn conclusion, f(z) is a meromorphic function on the complex plane with no poles."
