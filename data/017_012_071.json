    "message_2": "The non-abelian group of order 16 that we will consider is the Quaternion group, denoted as Q16 or Q_8. It has the following elements: {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}, with the multiplication rules:\n\ni^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1\n\nA permutation representation of a group is a homomorphism from the group to the symmetric group of permutations on a set. To find a permutation representation of Q16, we can consider its action on a set of four elements, which we will label {1, 2, 3, 4}. \n\nWe can define the action of Q16 on this set as follows:\n\n1. i: (1 2 3 4)\n2. -i: (1 4 3 2)\n3. j: (1 3)(2 4)\n4. -j: (1 3)(2 4)\n5. k: (1 4)(2 3)\n6. -k: (1 4)(2 3)\n7. 1: (1)(2)(3)(4)\n8. -1: (1)(2)(3)(4)\n\nNow, let's compare Q16 with the cyclic group C16 and the dihedral group D8.\n\nC16 is an abelian group generated by a single element, say g, with the elements {1, g, g^2, ..., g^15}. It has a regular permutation representation, where each element corresponds to a cycle of length 16. In contrast, Q16 is non-abelian and has a permutation representation on a set of four elements, as shown above.\n\nD8 is the dihedral group of order 16, which represents the symmetries of a regular octagon. It has eight rotational symmetries and eight reflectional symmetries. D8 is also non-abelian, but its structure is different from Q16. While Q16 has a permutation representation on a set of four elements, D8 has a permutation representation on a set of eight elements (corresponding to the vertices of the octagon).\n\nIn summary, the permutation representation of the non-abelian group Q16 differs from the cyclic group C16 and the dihedral group D8 in terms of the size of the set on which the group acts and the group's structure (abelian vs. non-abelian)."
