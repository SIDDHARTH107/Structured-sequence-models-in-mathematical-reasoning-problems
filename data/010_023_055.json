    "message_1": "What is the minimum number of crossings required to transform a trefoil knot into an unknot in geometric topology and knot theory?\n\nNote: A trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot and can be obtained by appending the ends of a twisted loop of ribbon to form a knot that is mathematically equivalent to the knot of a common three-leaf clover. An unknot is a simple closed curve in three-dimensional space, which can be continuously deformed into a circle without intersecting itself.",
    "message_2": "In geometric topology and knot theory, the minimum number of crossings required to transform a trefoil knot into an unknot is 3. This is because the trefoil knot has a crossing number of 3, which means it has three crossings in its simplest diagram. To untie the trefoil knot and turn it into an unknot, you would need to remove all three of these crossings."
