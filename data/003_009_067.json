    "message_1": "A triangle has one angle that measures 30 degrees, one angle that measures 60 degrees, and a side opposite the 60 degree angle that measures 10 inches. Find the perimeter of the triangle using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "We have a triangle with angles 30°, 60°, and 90° (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°). This is a 30-60-90 triangle, which has special properties. The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the ratio 1:√3:2.\n\nLet's label the sides of the triangle as follows:\n- Side a is opposite the 30° angle.\n- Side b is opposite the 60° angle (which is given as 10 inches).\n- Side c is opposite the 90° angle (the hypotenuse).\n\nSince side b is 10 inches, we can set up the following proportion to find the other sides:\n\nb/a = 10/1 = √3/1\na = 10/√3\n\nNow, we can find side c (the hypotenuse) using the same ratio:\n\nc/b = 2/√3\nc = 2 * (10/√3)\nc = 20/√3\n\nTo rationalize the denominators, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\na = (10/√3) * (√3/√3) = 10√3/3\nc = (20/√3) * (√3/√3) = 20√3/3\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = (10√3/3) + 10 + (20√3/3)\nPerimeter = (10√3 + 30√3)/3 + 10\nPerimeter = (40√3)/3 + 10\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is (40√3)/3 + 10 inches."
