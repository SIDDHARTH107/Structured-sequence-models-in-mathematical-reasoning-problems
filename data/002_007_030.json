    "message_1": "What is the area of a trapezoid with a height of 10 cm and bases of 8 cm and 12 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (base1 + base2) × height\n\nIn this case, base1 = 8 cm, base2 = 12 cm, and height = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (8 + 12) × 10\nArea = (1/2) × 20 × 10\nArea = 10 × 10\nArea = 100 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 100 square centimeters."
