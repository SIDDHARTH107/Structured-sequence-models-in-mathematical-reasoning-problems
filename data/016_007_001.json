    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by iteratively removing cubes from the original structure. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole structure are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes in each iteration.\n\nThe volume of the Menger sponge after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = a^3 * (20/27)^n\n\nwhere a is the side length of the original cube and n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, a = 3 cm and n = 5 iterations. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 3^3 * (20/27)^5\nVolume = 27 * (20/27)^5\nVolume ≈ 27 * 0.020408163\nVolume ≈ 0.55069594 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge with five levels of iteration and an original side length of 3 cm is approximately 0.5507 cm³."
