    "message_1": "A group of 15 students took a math test. The teacher graded the test using linear grading logic where each question is worth a certain number of points and a student's final score is the minimum number of points they earned on any question. If the test had 9 questions worth 10 points each, and the lowest score among the 15 students was 4, what is the highest possible score that any student could have received on the test?",
    "message_2": "If the lowest score among the 15 students was 4, it means that the student with the lowest score got at least 4 points on each question. Since there are 9 questions worth 10 points each, the highest possible score that any student could have received on the test is 9 * 10 = 90 points."
