    "message_1": "In a combinatorial game, there are two players A and B. They take turns removing stones from a pile of 12 stones. On each turn, a player must remove at least 1 stone, and no more than 4 stones. Player A takes the first turn. The player who takes the last stone wins. \n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for player A to ensure that they win the game?",
    "message_2": "The optimal strategy for player A to ensure they win the game is as follows:\n\n1. In the first turn, player A should remove 1 stone from the pile. This leaves 11 stones in the pile.\n2. From this point on, player A should aim to maintain a situation where the total number of stones removed by both players in each round (i.e., one turn for player A and one turn for player B) is equal to 5.\n3. To achieve this, player A should remove stones in such a way that the total number of stones removed by both players in each round is 5. For example, if player B removes 2 stones, player A should remove 3 stones in their next turn, and so on.\n\nBy following this strategy, player A ensures that they will take the last stone and win the game. Here's the reasoning behind this strategy:\n\n- After player A's first turn, there are 11 stones left.\n- Since both players remove a total of 5 stones in each round, after 2 rounds, there will be 1 stone left (11 - 2*5 = 1).\n- As player A starts each round, they will be the one to take the last stone and win the game."
