    "message_1": "Suppose a company is analyzing the salary data of its employees. The company has 200 employees in total, and they want to determine which variables (age, experience, education level, etc.) have the biggest impact on salary. Using discriminant analysis, they found that the best discriminant function is:\n\nZ = 0.47(age) + 0.89(experience) + 1.55(education) - 5.12\n\nNow suppose a new job applicant has an age of 35, 12 years of experience, and a graduate degree (which corresponds to an education level of 3 in this analysis). What is the predicted value of Z for this candidate? Based on this value, which salary range is this candidate likely to fall into?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted value of Z for this candidate, we need to plug in the given values for age, experience, and education level into the discriminant function:\n\nZ = 0.47(age) + 0.89(experience) + 1.55(education) - 5.12\nZ = 0.47(35) + 0.89(12) + 1.55(3) - 5.12\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of Z:\n\nZ = 16.45 + 10.68 + 4.65 - 5.12\nZ = 26.66\n\nThe predicted value of Z for this candidate is 26.66. To determine the salary range this candidate is likely to fall into, we would need more information about how the Z values correspond to specific salary ranges within the company. However, a higher Z value generally indicates a higher salary, so this candidate is likely to fall into a higher salary range compared to other candidates with lower Z values."
