    "message_2": "To prove that $H^j(M) \\neq 0$ for all $j \\geq k$, we will use the Poincaré duality theorem, which states that for a compact, oriented, smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, there is an isomorphism between the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th de Rham cohomology groups:\n\n$$H^k(M) \\cong H^{n-k}(M).$$\n\nNow, let $H^k(M) \\neq 0$ for some $k$. By Poincaré duality, we have $H^{n-k}(M) \\neq 0$. Since $k \\leq n$, it follows that $H^j(M) \\neq 0$ for all $j \\geq k$ and $j \\leq n-k$. \n\nTo find the maximum value of $k$ for which $H^k(M) \\neq 0$, we consider the case when $k = n$. If $H^n(M) \\neq 0$, then by Poincaré duality, $H^0(M) \\neq 0$. However, we know that $H^0(M) \\neq 0$ for any manifold $M$, since it corresponds to the space of constant functions on $M$. Therefore, the maximum value of $k$ for which $H^k(M) \\neq 0$ is $k = n$."
