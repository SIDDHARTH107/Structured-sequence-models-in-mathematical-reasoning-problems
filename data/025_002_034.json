    "message_2": "To find the common solutions of the two algebraic curves, we can first try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate z by solving the first equation for z^2 and substituting it into the second equation:\n\n$z^2 = x^2 + y^2$ (from $C_1$)\n\nNow substitute this into $C_2$:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + (x^2 + y^2) - 2xy - 2xz = 0$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$2x^2 + 2y^2 - 2xy - 2xz = 0$\n\nNow, let's solve for x in terms of y and z:\n\n$x(2x - 2y - 2z) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n\n1) $x = 0$\n\n2) $2x - 2y - 2z = 0$\n\nFor the first case, $x = 0$, substitute this back into $C_1$:\n\n$0 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$\n\n$y^2 = z^2$\n\nThis implies that either $y = z$ or $y = -z$. So, we have two solutions in this case: $(0, 1, 1)$ and $(0, 1, -1)$ (up to scalar multiplication in the projective plane).\n\nFor the second case, $2x - 2y - 2z = 0$, we can simplify it to:\n\n$x = y + z$\n\nNow substitute this back into $C_1$:\n\n$(y + z)^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n$y^2 + 2yz + z^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$\n\n$2y^2 + 2yz = 0$\n\n$y^2 + yz = 0$\n\nThis implies that either $y = 0$ or $y = -z$. \n\nIf $y = 0$, then from $x = y + z$, we have $x = z$. So, we have the solution $(1, 0, 1)$ (up to scalar multiplication in the projective plane).\n\nIf $y = -z$, then from $x = y + z$, we have $x = 0$. This case has already been considered in the first case.\n\nSo, in total, we have found 3 distinct common solutions (up to scalar multiplication in the complex projective plane) for the given algebraic curves:\n\n$(0, 1, 1)$, $(0, 1, -1)$, and $(1, 0, 1)$."
