    "message_2": "To find the values of sin(45°) and cos(60°) using the unit circle method, we need to recall the coordinates of the points on the unit circle corresponding to these angles.\n\nThe unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin (0, 0) of the coordinate plane. The coordinates of a point on the unit circle can be represented as (cos(θ), sin(θ)), where θ is the angle formed by the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point.\n\n1. sin(45°): \n45° is halfway between 0° and 90°. In this case, the coordinates of the point on the unit circle are (cos(45°), sin(45°)). Since the angle is bisecting the first quadrant, the x and y coordinates will be equal. Also, we know that the radius of the unit circle is 1, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n(cos(45°))^2 + (sin(45°))^2 = 1\nSince cos(45°) = sin(45°), we can rewrite the equation as:\n2 * (sin(45°))^2 = 1\n\nNow, solve for sin(45°):\n(sin(45°))^2 = 1/2\nsin(45°) = √(1/2) = √2 / 2\n\nSo, sin(45°) = √2 / 2.\n\n2. cos(60°):\n60° is halfway between 90° and 0°, and it is one of the angles of an equilateral triangle. In this case, the coordinates of the point on the unit circle are (cos(60°), sin(60°)). We can use the properties of a 30-60-90 right triangle to find the value of cos(60°). In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. The hypotenuse is the radius of the unit circle, which is 1. Therefore, the side adjacent to the 60° angle (which is the x-coordinate or cos(60°)) is half the length of the hypotenuse:\n\ncos(60°) = 1/2\n\nSo, cos(60°) = 1/2.\n\nIn summary, sin(45°) = √2 / 2 and cos(60°) = 1/2."
