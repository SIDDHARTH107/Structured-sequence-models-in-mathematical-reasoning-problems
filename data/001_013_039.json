    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x + 5) = 7, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n\n(√(2x + 5))^2 = 7^2\n\n2x + 5 = 49\n\nNow, we will isolate x by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\n2x = 44\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x.\n\nx = 22\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(2x + 5) = 7 is x = 22."
