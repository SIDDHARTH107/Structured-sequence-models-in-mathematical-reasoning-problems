    "message_2": "To find the solutions to the homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to reduce the system to its row echelon form. The augmented matrix of the system is:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & -3 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & -4 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nFirst, we can swap the first and second rows to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & -3 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & -4 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we can eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column of the second and third rows. To do this, we can subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -5 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -7 & 5 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we can divide the second row by -5 to get a 1 in the second row and second column:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -\\frac{3}{5} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -7 & 5 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we can eliminate the -7 in the second column of the third row by adding 7 times the second row to the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -\\frac{3}{5} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{5} & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nFinally, we can multiply the third row by 5 to get a 1 in the third row and third column:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -\\frac{3}{5} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the solutions to the system. From the third row, we have:\n\n$$\nz = 0\n$$\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n$$\ny - \\frac{3}{5}z = 0 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{3}{5}z = 0\n$$\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n$$\nx + y - z = 0 \\Rightarrow x = z - y = 0\n$$\n\nSo, the only solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\n$$\nx = 0, y = 0, z = 0\n$$"
