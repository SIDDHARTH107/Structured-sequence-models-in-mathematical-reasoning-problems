    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2^(2x-1) = 32, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite 32 as a power of 2.\n32 = 2^5\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the equation with the new expression for 32.\n2^(2x-1) = 2^5\n\nStep 3: Since the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other.\n2x - 1 = 5\n\nStep 4: Solve for x.\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution is x = 3."
