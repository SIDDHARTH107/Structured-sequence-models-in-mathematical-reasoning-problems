    "message_2": "To find the complex Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-|t|), we need to compute the following integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nSince f(t) = e^(-|t|) is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(ω) = 2 * ∫[e^(-|t|) * cos(ωt)] dt, from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, we need to consider two cases for the integral:\n\n1. For t ≥ 0, f(t) = e^(-t), so the integral becomes:\n\nF(ω) = 2 * ∫[e^(-t) * cos(ωt)] dt, from 0 to infinity.\n\n2. For t < 0, f(t) = e^(t), so the integral becomes:\n\nF(ω) = 2 * ∫[e^(t) * cos(ωt)] dt, from -infinity to 0.\n\nAdding both integrals, we get:\n\nF(ω) = 2 * [∫[e^(-t) * cos(ωt)] dt + ∫[e^(t) * cos(ωt)] dt], from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve each integral. Let u = cos(ωt) and dv = e^(-t) dt for the first integral, and u = cos(ωt) and dv = e^(t) dt for the second integral. After solving the integrals, we get:\n\nF(ω) = 2 * [(1 + ω^2) / (1 + ω^2)^2].\n\nSo, the complex Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-|t|) is:\n\nF(ω) = 2 * (1 + ω^2) / (1 + ω^2)^2."
