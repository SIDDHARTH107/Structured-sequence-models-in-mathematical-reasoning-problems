    "message_2": "To use Cholesky decomposition, we first need to check if the given matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The matrix A formed from the coefficients of the given system of linear equations is:\n\nA = | 2  1  1 |\n    | 4  5  4 |\n    | 8  4  5 |\n\nThe matrix A is not symmetric, so we cannot use Cholesky decomposition to solve this system of linear equations. Instead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or Cramer's rule. Let's use Gaussian elimination to find the solution.\n\nFirst, we'll form the augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  1  1 | 5\n| 4  5  4 | 18\n| 8  4  5 | 24\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2:\n\n| 1  1/2  1/2 | 5/2\n| 4  5    4   | 18\n| 8  4    5   | 24\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 8 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1/2  1/2 |  5/2\n| 0  3    2   |  4\n| 0 -2   -1   |  8\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 3:\n\n| 1  1/2  1/2 |  5/2\n| 0  1    2/3 |  4/3\n| 0 -2   -1   |  8\n\nStep 4: Add 2 times the second row to the third row:\n\n| 1  1/2  1/2 |  5/2\n| 0  1    2/3 |  4/3\n| 0  0    1/3 | 16/3\n\nStep 5: Solve for z:\n\n1/3 * z = 16/3\nz = 16\n\nStep 6: Solve for y:\n\ny + 2/3 * z = 4/3\ny + 2/3 * 16 = 4/3\ny = -8\n\nStep 7: Solve for x:\n\nx + 1/2 * y + 1/2 * z = 5/2\nx - 4 + 8 = 5/2\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = -8, and z = 16."
