    "message_1": "An engineering firm is designing a suspension system for a new car model. There are two objectives to consider: minimizing the cost of producing the suspension system and maximizing its performance in terms of comfort and stability. The firm has identified three different types of shock absorbers that can be used in the system - type A, type B and type C. The cost of each type of shock absorber and its corresponding performance score (on a scale of 1 to 10) are as follows:\n\n| Shock absorber type | Cost ($) | Comfort score | Stability score |\n|---------------------|----------|---------------|----------------|\n| A                   | 150      | 7             | 6              |\n| B                   | 250      | 9             | 5              |\n| C                   | 175      | 5             | 8              |\n\nThe firm wants to determine the optimal combination of the three types of shock absorbers to use in the suspension system, given that they want to minimize cost and maximize performance. What is the optimal combination of shock absorbers that the firm should use, and what is the corresponding cost and performance score of the suspension system?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal combination of shock absorbers, we need to consider both cost and performance. We can calculate the performance-to-cost ratio for each shock absorber type and then determine the best combination based on these ratios.\n\nPerformance-to-cost ratio = (Comfort score + Stability score) / Cost\n\nFor type A:\nPerformance-to-cost ratio = (7 + 6) / 150 = 13 / 150 ≈ 0.0867\n\nFor type B:\nPerformance-to-cost ratio = (9 + 5) / 250 = 14 / 250 ≈ 0.056\n\nFor type C:\nPerformance-to-cost ratio = (5 + 8) / 175 = 13 / 175 ≈ 0.0743\n\nBased on the performance-to-cost ratios, type A has the highest ratio, followed by type C and then type B. This means that type A provides the best performance for its cost.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the combination of shock absorbers to maximize both comfort and stability. We can analyze different combinations of shock absorbers and their corresponding costs and performance scores:\n\n1. Combination: A + B\n   Cost: 150 + 250 = $400\n   Comfort score: 7 + 9 = 16\n   Stability score: 6 + 5 = 11\n\n2. Combination: A + C\n   Cost: 150 + 175 = $325\n   Comfort score: 7 + 5 = 12\n   Stability score: 6 + 8 = 14\n\n3. Combination: B + C\n   Cost: 250 + 175 = $425\n   Comfort score: 9 + 5 = 14\n   Stability score: 5 + 8 = 13\n\n4. Combination: A + B + C\n   Cost: 150 + 250 + 175 = $575\n   Comfort score: 7 + 9 + 5 = 21\n   Stability score: 6 + 5 + 8 = 19\n\nBased on the combinations, the optimal combination of shock absorbers that the firm should use is A + C, as it has the lowest cost ($325) while still providing a good balance of comfort (12) and stability (14) scores."
