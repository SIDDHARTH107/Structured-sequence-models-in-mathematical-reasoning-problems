    "message_1": "In a combinatorial design, there are 15 points and 35 lines. Each line contains exactly 3 points, and each pair of points appears on exactly one line. How many points are contained in exactly 10 lines?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of points contained in exactly 10 lines as x. We will use the concept of double counting to solve this problem.\n\nConsider the pairs of points. There are a total of C(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * 13!) = 105 pairs of points. Since each pair of points appears on exactly one line, there are 105 lines containing 2 points each.\n\nNow, let's count the number of pairs of points in a different way. We know that there are 35 lines, and each line contains 3 points. So, each line contributes 3 pairs of points. Therefore, there are 35 * 3 = 105 pairs of points in total.\n\nLet's consider the points that are contained in exactly 10 lines. Each of these x points will be a part of 10 lines, and each line will contribute 2 pairs of points (since the point is part of 2 pairs in each line). So, these x points will contribute 2 * 10 * x = 20x pairs of points.\n\nThe remaining 15 - x points will be contained in fewer than 10 lines. Let's denote the number of lines containing the i-th point as Li. Then, the sum of all Li for the remaining 15 - x points is equal to 35 * 3 - 20x (since there are 105 pairs of points in total).\n\nNow, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. Since there are 15 - x points and the sum of their Li values is 35 * 3 - 20x, there must be at least one point with Li >= (35 * 3 - 20x) / (15 - x).\n\nWe know that Li < 10 for these points, so we have:\n\n(35 * 3 - 20x) / (15 - x) < 10\n\nSolving this inequality, we get:\n\n105 - 20x < 150 - 10x\n10x < 45\nx < 4.5\n\nSince x must be an integer, the maximum value of x is 4. Therefore, there are at most 4 points contained in exactly 10 lines."
