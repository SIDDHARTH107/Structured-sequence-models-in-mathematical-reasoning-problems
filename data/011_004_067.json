    "message_1": "In a classroom of 20 students, 3 students are selected to represent the class in a math competition. How many ways can the class choose the 3 representatives if 4 of the students are from grade 7, 6 students are from grade 8, and 10 students are from grade 9?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nWe will consider the different possible scenarios for selecting the 3 representatives:\n\n1. All 3 representatives are from different grades.\n2. Two representatives are from the same grade, and the third is from a different grade.\n\nScenario 1: All 3 representatives are from different grades.\nIn this case, we need to choose 1 student from each grade. So, we have:\nC(4,1) * C(6,1) * C(10,1) = (4!/(1!(4-1)!) * (6!/(1!(6-1)!) * (10!/(1!(10-1)!))\n= (4) * (6) * (10) = 240 ways\n\nScenario 2: Two representatives are from the same grade, and the third is from a different grade.\nThere are 3 possible cases for this scenario:\n\nCase 1: Two representatives are from grade 7, and the third is from grade 8 or grade 9.\nC(4,2) * (C(6,1) + C(10,1)) = (4!/(2!(4-2)!) * (6 + 10)\n= (6) * (16) = 96 ways\n\nCase 2: Two representatives are from grade 8, and the third is from grade 7 or grade 9.\nC(6,2) * (C(4,1) + C(10,1)) = (6!/(2!(6-2)!) * (4 + 10)\n= (15) * (14) = 210 ways\n\nCase 3: Two representatives are from grade 9, and the third is from grade 7 or grade 8.\nC(10,2) * (C(4,1) + C(6,1)) = (10!/(2!(10-2)!) * (4 + 6)\n= (45) * (10) = 450 ways\n\nNow, we add up the ways from all scenarios and cases:\n240 (Scenario 1) + 96 (Case 1) + 210 (Case 2) + 450 (Case 3) = 996 ways\n\nSo, there are 996 ways to choose the 3 representatives from the class."
