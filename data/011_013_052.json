    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem, we first need to find the cycle index polynomial for the necklace. Since there are 8 beads, we consider the group of rotations of order 8, which is the cyclic group C_8.\n\nThe cycle index polynomial for the cyclic group C_8 is given by:\n\nP(C_8) = (1/8)(a_1^8 + a_2^4 + 2a_4^2 + 4a_8)\n\nNow, we have two colors for the beads, so we substitute a_1 = a_2 = a_4 = a_8 = 2 in the cycle index polynomial:\n\nP(C_8) = (1/8)(2^8 + 2^4 + 2(2^2) + 4(2))\n\nP(C_8) = (1/8)(256 + 16 + 8 + 8)\n\nP(C_8) = (1/8)(288)\n\nP(C_8) = 36\n\nSo, there are 36 ways to arrange the 8 beads with 4 beads of one color and 4 beads of another color on a necklace, considering two arrangements are considered the same if one can be rotated to obtain the other."
