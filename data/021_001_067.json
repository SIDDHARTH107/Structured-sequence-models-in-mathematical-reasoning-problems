    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n\n|  3   5  -1 |  7  |\n| -2   3   4 | -12 |\n|  1  -1   2 |  3  |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the -2 in the second row and the 1 in the third row of the first column. To do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n\nR2 = R2 + (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R1\n\n|  3    5   -1 |   7   |\n|  0  11/3  10 | -22/3 |\n|  0  -8/3  7/3|  2/3  |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the -8/3 in the third row of the second column. To do this, we will perform the following row operation:\n\nR3 = R3 + (8/11)R2\n\n|  3    5    -1 |   7   |\n|  0  11/3  10  | -22/3 |\n|  0    0   34/3|  10/3 |\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nNow that we have an upper triangular matrix, we can perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n(34/3)z = 10/3\nz = (10/3) / (34/3) = 10/34 = 5/17\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n(11/3)y + 10z = -22/3\ny = (-22/3 - 10z) / (11/3)\ny = (-22/3 - 10(5/17)) / (11/3)\ny = (-22/3 - 50/17) * (3/11)\ny = (-106/17) * (3/11)\ny = -318/187\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n3x + 5y - z = 7\nx = (7 - 5y + z) / 3\nx = (7 - 5(-318/187) + 5/17) / 3\nx = (7 + 1590/187 + 5/17) / 3\nx = (7 + 1595/187) / 3\nx = (7 + 477/51) / 3\nx = 484/51\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 484/51\ny = -318/187\nz = 5/17"
