    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 for x, where x is between 0 and 360 degrees (both inclusive), follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(x) by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation and then dividing by 2:\n\n2sin(x) + 1 - 1 = 0 - 1\n2sin(x) = -1\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\n2. Now we need to find the angles x for which sin(x) = -1/2. Since sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we will look for the reference angle in those quadrants.\n\n3. The reference angle for sin(x) = 1/2 is 30 degrees (or Ï€/6 radians). To find the angles in the third and fourth quadrants, we can use the following formulas:\n\nThird quadrant angle: 180 + reference angle\nFourth quadrant angle: 360 - reference angle\n\n4. Calculate the angles:\n\nThird quadrant angle: 180 + 30 = 210 degrees\nFourth quadrant angle: 360 - 30 = 330 degrees\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 for x between 0 and 360 degrees (both inclusive) are x = 210 degrees and x = 330 degrees."
