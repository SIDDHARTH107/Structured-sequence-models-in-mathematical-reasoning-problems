    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$ at the point $(1,0)$, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. \n\nImplicit differentiation is used here since the equation is not explicitly solved for $y$. \n\nGiven the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x$, we can differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - x)$$\n\nUsing the chain rule on the left side and basic differentiation rules on the right side, we get:\n\n$$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 1$$\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point $(1,0)$. We plug in the coordinates $(x,y) = (1,0)$ into the equation:\n\n$$2(0)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(1)^2 - 1$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$0 = 2$$\n\nSince this equation is not true, there is no tangent line to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$ at the point $(1,0)$. This is because the point $(1,0)$ is an inflection point on the curve, and the tangent line is vertical at this point."
