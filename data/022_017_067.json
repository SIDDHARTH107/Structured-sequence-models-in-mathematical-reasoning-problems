Use these initial conditions to determine the values of A and b that define the particular solution to the differential equation.",
    "message_2": "a) To show that y(x) = A e^(i bx) is a solution to the differential equation, we need to find the first and second derivatives of y(x) and substitute them into the given differential equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative y'(x):\n\ny'(x) = d/dx (A e^(i bx)) = A (i b) e^(i bx)\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative y''(x):\n\ny''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (A e^(i bx)) = A (i b)^2 e^(i bx) = -A b^2 e^(i bx)\n\nNow, let's substitute y(x), y'(x), and y''(x) into the given differential equation:\n\n- A b^2 e^(i bx) + A e^(i bx) = 0\n\nFactor out A e^(i bx):\n\nA e^(i bx) (-b^2 + 1) = 0\n\nSince A e^(i bx) is never zero, we must have:\n\n-b^2 + 1 = 0\n\nb^2 = 1\n\nb = Â±1\n\nSo, y(x) = A e^(i bx) is indeed a solution to the differential equation.\n\nb) The general solution to this differential equation is the linear combination of the two linearly independent solutions found in part (a):\n\ny(x) = A1 e^(i x) + A2 e^(-i x)\n\nwhere A1 and A2 are arbitrary constants.\n\nc) Now, let's use the initial conditions y(0) = 2i and y'(0) = 3 to determine the values of A1 and A2.\n\nFirst, let's find y'(x):\n\ny'(x) = i A1 e^(i x) - i A2 e^(-i x)\n\nNow, let's apply the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = A1 e^(0) + A2 e^(0) = A1 + A2 = 2i\n\ny'(0) = i A1 e^(0) - i A2 e^(0) = i A1 - i A2 = 3\n\nWe have a system of linear equations:\n\nA1 + A2 = 2i\ni A1 - i A2 = 3\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nA1 = (3 + 2i)/2\nA2 = (-1 + 2i)/2\n\nSo, the particular solution to the differential equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\ny(x) = ((3 + 2i)/2) e^(i x) + ((-1 + 2i)/2) e^(-i x)"
