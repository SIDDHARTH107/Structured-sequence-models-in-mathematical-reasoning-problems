    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', is given by:\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nSo, we can list out the elements in A' as follows:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement is unique. To do this, we will use a proof by contradiction. Let's assume that there exists another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also a complement of A.\n\nThis means that:\n\n1. B ⊆ U\n2. A ∩ B = Ø (A and B are disjoint)\n3. A ∪ B = U (A and B together form the universal set)\n\nNow, let's compare the sets A' and B:\n\nSince A' and B are both complements of A, they must satisfy conditions 2 and 3. \n\nFor condition 2, we know that A ∩ A' = Ø and A ∩ B = Ø. This means that both A' and B do not share any elements with A.\n\nFor condition 3, we know that A ∪ A' = U and A ∪ B = U. This means that both A' and B, when combined with A, form the universal set U.\n\nNow, let's consider an element x that belongs to A'. Since A' is a complement of A, x must belong to U but not to A. Since A ∪ B = U, x must also belong to B. This means that x belongs to both A' and B. \n\nSince x is an arbitrary element, this implies that all elements of A' also belong to B. Therefore, A' ⊆ B.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that for any element y in B, y must also belong to A'. This implies that B ⊆ A'.\n\nSince A' ⊆ B and B ⊆ A', we can conclude that A' = B. This contradicts our initial assumption that there exists another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also a complement of A.\n\nTherefore, the complement of A is unique, and in this case, A' = {1, 3, 5}."
