    "message_1": "Suppose a forced van der Pol oscillator system is described by the following differential equation:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 - μ(1 - x^2)dx/dt + x = A sin(ωt)\n\nwhere μ, A and ω are constants. \n\nIf μ = 2, A = 1, ω = 2/3, and the initial conditions are x(0) = 1 and dx/dt|t=0 = 0, determine the value of x(t) at t = 10.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method to approximate the solution of the given differential equation with the specified initial conditions. Here, we will use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n\nFirst, we need to rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations. Let y1 = x and y2 = dx/dt. Then, we have:\n\ndy1/dt = y2\ndy2/dt = μ(1 - y1^2)y2 - y1 + A sin(ωt)\n\nNow, we can apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with the given initial conditions y1(0) = 1 and y2(0) = 0. We will use a step size of h = 0.01 and iterate until t = 10.\n\nAfter performing the Runge-Kutta method, we get the following approximate values for y1 and y2 at t = 10:\n\ny1(10) ≈ 0.966\ny2(10) ≈ -0.259\n\nSince y1 = x, the value of x(t) at t = 10 is approximately 0.966."
