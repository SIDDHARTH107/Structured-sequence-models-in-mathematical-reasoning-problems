Find the displacement equation of the mass as a function of time, and determine the frequency and period of the resulting oscillations.",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement equation of the mass as a function of time, we can use the equation for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω) using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass.\n\nω = sqrt(20 N/m / 0.5 kg) = sqrt(40) = 2√10 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ). We know the initial displacement x(0) = 0.2 m and initial velocity v(0) = 0.3 m/s. Using the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) => 0.2 = A * cos(φ)\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(φ) => 0.3 = -A * 2√10 * sin(φ)\n\nWe have two equations with two unknowns (A and φ). To solve for A and φ, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin²(φ) + cos²(φ) = 1\n\nSubstituting the expressions for cos(φ) and sin(φ) from the initial conditions equations:\n\n(0.2/A)² + (-0.3/(A * 2√10))² = 1\n\nSolving for A, we get:\n\nA = 0.1√(13) m\n\nNow, we can find the phase angle (φ) using the initial displacement equation:\n\n0.2 = 0.1√(13) * cos(φ)\n\ncos(φ) = 0.2 / 0.1√(13)\n\nφ = arccos(0.2 / 0.1√(13))\n\nNow we have all the parameters needed for the displacement equation:\n\nx(t) = 0.1√(13) * cos(2√10 * t + arccos(0.2 / 0.1√(13)))\n\nTo find the frequency (f) and period (T) of the oscillations, we can use the following formulas:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\nT = 1 / f\n\nf = (2√10) / (2π) ≈ 1.005 Hz\nT = 1 / 1.005 ≈ 0.995 s\n\nSo, the displacement equation of the mass as a function of time is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1√(13) * cos(2√10 * t + arccos(0.2 / 0.1√(13)))\n\nAnd the frequency and period of the resulting oscillations are approximately 1.005 Hz and 0.995 s, respectively."
