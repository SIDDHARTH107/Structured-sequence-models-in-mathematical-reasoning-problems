    "message_2": "To find the median, we first need to arrange the dataset in ascending order:\n\n68, 75, 79, 80, 83, 87, 90, 92\n\nSince there are 8 numbers in the dataset (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle numbers (4th and 5th numbers in this case):\n\n(80 + 83) / 2 = 163 / 2 = 81.5\n\nThe median of the dataset is 81.5."
