    "message_1": "A company claims that their machines produce nails with an average length of 4cm. A sample of 25 nails is collected and the sample mean is found to be 3.8cm with a sample standard deviation of 0.5cm. Is there enough evidence to suggest that the true average length of nails produced by the machine is less than 4cm at 5% level of significance? Use hypothesis testing to justify your answer.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is enough evidence to suggest that the true average length of nails produced by the machine is less than 4cm at a 5% level of significance, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 4cm (The true average length of nails is 4cm)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ < 4cm (The true average length of nails is less than 4cm)\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √n)\nt = (3.8 - 4) / (0.5 / √25)\nt = (-0.2) / (0.5 / 5)\nt = -0.2 / 0.1\nt = -2\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value\nSince this is a one-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom (n-1) and α = 0.05, we can find the critical value using a t-distribution table or calculator. The critical value is approximately -1.71.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value\nThe test statistic t = -2 is less than the critical value of -1.71.\n\nStep 6: Make a decision\nSince the test statistic is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence to suggest that the true average length of nails produced by the machine is less than 4cm at a 5% level of significance."
