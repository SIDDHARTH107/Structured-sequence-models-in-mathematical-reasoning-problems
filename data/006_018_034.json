    "message_2": "To find the probability of a company having at least one case of financial fraud, we can first find the probability of a company not having any financial fraud and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe historical data shows that 5 out of 100 companies experienced fraud in the past year. Therefore, the probability of a company experiencing fraud is 5/100 or 0.05.\n\nThe probability of a company not experiencing fraud is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of a company having at least one case of financial fraud, which is the opposite of not having any financial fraud. So, we subtract the probability of not having any financial fraud from 1:\n\nProbability of at least one case of financial fraud = 1 - Probability of not having any financial fraud = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 or 5%.\n\nSo, the probability of a company having at least one case of financial fraud is 5%."
