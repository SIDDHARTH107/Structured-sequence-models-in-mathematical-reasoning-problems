    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\sqrt{3x-5} = 2$, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n$(\\sqrt{3x-5})^2 = 2^2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$3x-5 = 4$\n\nNow, we will isolate the variable x by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$3x = 9$\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n$x = 3$\n\nSo, the solution to the equation $\\sqrt{3x-5} = 2$ is $x = 3$."
