    "message_2": "We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this problem. Let's denote the given conditions as follows:\n\n1. x ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n2. x ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n3. x ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we need to find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we'll compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N / 3 = 105 / 3 = 35\nN2 = N / 5 = 105 / 5 = 21\nN3 = N / 7 = 105 / 7 = 15\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses:\n\n1. y1 ≡ N1^(-1) (mod 3) => 35y1 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. y2 ≡ N2^(-1) (mod 5) => 21y2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n3. y3 ≡ N3^(-1) (mod 7) => 15y3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSolving for the modular inverses, we get:\n\n1. y1 = 2 (since 35 * 2 = 70 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\n2. y2 = 1 (since 21 * 1 = 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\n3. y3 = 1 (since 15 * 1 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nNow, we can find the solution for x:\n\nx = (2 * 35 * 2) + (1 * 21 * 1) + (3 * 15 * 1)\nx = (140) + (21) + (45)\nx = 206\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the smallest positive integer, we need to find the smallest positive solution within the range of the moduli product (0 to 105):\n\nx = 206 % 105 = 101\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the given conditions is 101."
