    "message_1": "A company produces cans of soft drinks with varying capacities. The production manager wants to determine the average capacity of the cans. To estimate the average capacity, the manager takes a sample of 15 cans and records their capacities. However, the manager suspects that some of the machines in the production line are producing defective cans that have lower capacities.\n\nThe capacities of the sample are as follows:\n\n375ml, 370ml, 400ml, 390ml, 450ml, 340ml, 380ml,  350ml, 360ml, 420ml, 430ml, 440ml, 335ml, 370ml, 460ml\n\nUsing the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method, determine the average capacity of the cans.",
    "message_2": "To determine the average capacity of the cans using the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order:\n335ml, 340ml, 350ml, 360ml, 370ml, 370ml, 375ml, 380ml, 390ml, 400ml, 420ml, 430ml, 440ml, 450ml, 460ml\n\n2. Calculate the median of the data:\nMedian = 380ml (since there are 15 data points, the median is the 8th value)\n\n3. Calculate the absolute deviations from the median:\n5ml, 40ml, 30ml, 20ml, 10ml, 10ml, 5ml, 0ml, 10ml, 20ml, 40ml, 50ml, 60ml, 70ml, 80ml\n\n4. Arrange the absolute deviations in ascending order:\n0ml, 5ml, 5ml, 10ml, 10ml, 10ml, 20ml, 20ml, 30ml, 40ml, 40ml, 50ml, 60ml, 70ml, 80ml\n\n5. Calculate the median of the absolute deviations:\nMedian Absolute Deviation (MAD) = 10ml (since there are 15 data points, the median is the 8th value)\n\nNow that we have the MAD, we can use it to identify and remove potential outliers. A common approach is to consider data points that are more than 2 or 3 times the MAD away from the median as outliers. In this case, let's use 3 times the MAD:\n\nOutlier threshold = 3 * MAD = 3 * 10ml = 30ml\n\n6. Identify and remove potential outliers:\n335ml and 460ml are more than 30ml away from the median (380ml), so we can consider them as outliers and remove them from the data.\n\n7. Calculate the average capacity of the remaining cans:\n340ml, 350ml, 360ml, 370ml, 370ml, 375ml, 380ml, 390ml, 400ml, 420ml, 430ml, 440ml, 450ml\n\nSum = 4875ml\nNumber of cans = 13\n\nAverage capacity = Sum / Number of cans = 4875ml / 13 â‰ˆ 375ml\n\nUsing the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method, the estimated average capacity of the cans is approximately 375ml."
