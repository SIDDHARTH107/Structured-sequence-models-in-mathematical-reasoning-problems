    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components in a graph with 8 vertices and 14 edges, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of connected components = (Number of vertices) - (Number of edges) + k\n\nwhere k is the number of isolated vertices (vertices with no edges).\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of edges in a connected graph with 8 vertices. A complete graph with n vertices has n*(n-1)/2 edges. So, for 8 vertices:\n\nMaximum number of edges = 8*(8-1)/2 = 8*7/2 = 28\n\nSince the given graph has 14 edges, which is less than the maximum number of edges for a connected graph with 8 vertices, it is possible that the graph has more than one connected component.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 8 vertices. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. So, for 8 vertices:\n\nMinimum number of edges = 8 - 1 = 7\n\nSince the given graph has 14 edges, which is more than the minimum number of edges required for a connected graph with 8 vertices, it is possible that the graph has at least one connected component.\n\nTo find the exact number of connected components, we can use the formula mentioned earlier:\n\nNumber of connected components = (Number of vertices) - (Number of edges) + k\n\nSince the graph has 14 edges and 8 vertices, we have:\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + k\n\nNow, we need to find the value of k. Since the graph has 14 edges, which is more than the minimum number of edges required for a connected graph with 8 vertices, we can assume that there are no isolated vertices (k=0).\n\nTherefore, the number of connected components in the graph is:\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + 0 = -6\n\nHowever, the number of connected components cannot be negative. This means that our assumption of no isolated vertices is incorrect. Let's try with k=1 (one isolated vertex):\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + 1 = -5\n\nThis is still negative, so let's try with k=2 (two isolated vertices):\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + 2 = -4\n\nThis is still negative, so let's try with k=3 (three isolated vertices):\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + 3 = -3\n\nThis is still negative, so let's try with k=4 (four isolated vertices):\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + 4 = -2\n\nThis is still negative, so let's try with k=5 (five isolated vertices):\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + 5 = -1\n\nThis is still negative, so let's try with k=6 (six isolated vertices):\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + 6 = 0\n\nThis is still not possible, as there must be at least one connected component in the graph. Let's try with k=7 (seven isolated vertices):\n\nNumber of connected components = 8 - 14 + 7 = 1\n\nThis is a valid result, as there must be at least one connected component in the graph.\n\nSo, the graph with 8 vertices and 14 edges has 1 connected component."
