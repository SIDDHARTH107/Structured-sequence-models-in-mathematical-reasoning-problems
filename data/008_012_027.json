    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  8  |\n    | -14 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the signs of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdjoint(A) = | -5 -3 |\n                     | -4  2 |\n\nNow, let's find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                           | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/22  3/22 |\n              | 4/22 -2/22 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/22  3/22 | * |  8  |\n       |  4/22 -2/22 |   | -14 |\n\nX = | (5/22)*8 + (3/22)*(-14) |\n       | (4/22)*8 + (-2/22)*(-14) |\n\nX = |  40/22 - 42/22 |\n       |  32/22 + 28/22 |\n\nX = | -2/22 |\n       | 60/22 |\n\nX = | -1/11 |\n       | 30/11 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = -1/11 and y = 30/11."
