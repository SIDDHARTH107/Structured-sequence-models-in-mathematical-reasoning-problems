    "message_1": "A tree is located 30 meters from the right angle of a triangle. An observer standing at the same level as the base of the tree measures the angle of elevation to the top of the tree as 35 degrees. Find the height of the tree (to the nearest meter) using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (the height of the tree) to the adjacent side (the distance from the tree to the observer).\n\nLet h be the height of the tree. We have:\n\ntan(35°) = h / 30\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation and solve for h:\n\nh = 30 * tan(35°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of tan(35°):\n\ntan(35°) ≈ 0.7002\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nh ≈ 30 * 0.7002\nh ≈ 21.006\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the tree is approximately 21 meters."
