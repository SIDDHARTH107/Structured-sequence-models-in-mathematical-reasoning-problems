    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using block matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form:\n\n[2  3  4] [x]   [10]\n[5  6  7] [y] = [20]\n[8  9 10] [z]   [30]\n\nNow, let's partition the matrix into blocks. We can partition the matrix into 2x2 and 1x1 blocks:\n\n| A  B | | X |   | C |\n|      | |   | = |   |\n| C' D | | Y |   | D'|\n\nwhere A = [2 3], B = [4], C = [10], X = [x], Y = [y], and Z = [z]. C' = [5 6], D = [7], and D' = [20 30].\n\nNow, we can write the block matrix equation as:\n\nAX + BY = C\nC'X + DY = D'\n\nLet's first solve for X:\n\nAX = C - BY\n\nTo find X, we need to find the inverse of A. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nThe determinant of A is:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 6) - (3 * 3) = 12 - 9 = 3\n\nThe adjugate of A is:\n\nadj(A) = [ 6 -3]\n                [-4  2]\n\nSo, the inverse of A is:\n\nA_inv = (1/3) * [ 6 -3]\n                      [-4  2]\n\nNow, we can find X:\n\nX = A_inv * (C - BY)\n\nFirst, let's find (C - BY):\n\nC - BY = [10] - [4] * [y]\n              = [10 - 4y]\n\nNow, let's find X:\n\nX = (1/3) * [ 6 -3] * [10 - 4y]\n                 [-4  2]\n\nX = [ (6 * (10 - 4y) - 3 * (-4 * y + 2 * (10 - 4y))) / 3 ]\n      [ (-4 * (10 - 4y) + 2 * (-4 * y + 2 * (10 - 4y))) / 3 ]\n\nX = [ (60 - 24y + 12y - 6 * (10 - 4y)) / 3 ]\n      [ (-40 + 16y + 8y - 4 * (10 - 4y)) / 3 ]\n\nX = [ (60 - 12y - 60 + 24y) / 3 ]\n      [ (-40 + 24y - 40 + 16y) / 3 ]\n\nX = [ 12y / 3 ]\n      [ 40y / 3 ]\n\nX = [ 4y ]\n      [ 40y/3 ]\n\nNow, let's solve for Y:\n\nC'X + DY = D'\n\n[5 6] [ 4y ] + [7] [y] = [20 30]\n            [40y/3]\n\n[20y + 40y/3] + [7y] = [20 30]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n20y + 40y/3 + 7y = 20\n20y + 40y/3 + 7y = 30\n\nLet's solve the first equation for y:\n\n20y + 40y/3 + 7y = 20\n(60y + 40y + 21y) / 3 = 20\n121y / 3 = 20\n121y = 60\ny = 60 / 121\n\nNow, let's plug the value of y back into X:\n\nX = [ 4y ]\n      [ 40y/3 ]\n\nX = [ 4 * (60 / 121) ]\n      [ 40 * (60 / 121) / 3 ]\n\nX = [ 240 / 121 ]\n      [ 800 / 363 ]\n\nNow, we have the values of X and Y:\n\nx = 240 / 121\ny = 60 / 121\n\nNow, let's find the value of z using the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 10\n\n2(240/121) + 3(60/121) + 4z = 10\n\n(480 + 180) / 121 + 4z = 10\n\n660 / 121 + 4z = 10\n\n4z = 10 - 660 / 121\n\n4z = (1210 - 660) / 121\n\n4z = 550 / 121\n\nz = 550 / (121 * 4)\n\nz = 550 / 484\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 240 / 121\ny = 60 / 121\nz = 550 / 484"
