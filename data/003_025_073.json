    "message_1": "A plane is flying at a speed of 500 mph and is heading due north. The wind is blowing from the west at a speed of 100 mph. What is the magnitude and direction of the plane's velocity relative to the ground? Solve using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use vector addition and trigonometry. We can represent the plane's velocity as a vector and the wind's velocity as another vector. Then, we can add these two vectors to find the plane's velocity relative to the ground.\n\nLet Vp represent the plane's velocity vector and Vw represent the wind's velocity vector. The plane's velocity vector Vp has a magnitude of 500 mph and is pointing due north. The wind's velocity vector Vw has a magnitude of 100 mph and is pointing due east (since the wind is blowing from the west).\n\nWe can represent Vp and Vw as follows:\n\nVp = 500i + 0j (500 mph north)\nVw = 0i - 100j (100 mph east)\n\nNow, we can add Vp and Vw to find the plane's velocity relative to the ground (Vg):\n\nVg = Vp + Vw\nVg = (500i + 0j) + (0i - 100j)\nVg = 500i - 100j\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of Vg using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n|Vg| = √(500^2 + (-100)^2)\n|Vg| = √(250000 + 10000)\n|Vg| = √260000\n|Vg| ≈ 509.9 mph\n\nNext, we can find the direction of Vg using the arctangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = (-100) / 500\nθ = arctan(-1/5)\nθ ≈ -11.3°\n\nSince the angle is negative, it means the direction is 11.3° west of north. So, the plane's velocity relative to the ground is approximately 509.9 mph, 11.3° west of north."
