Suppose the company wants to minimize the daily cost of production using the cuckoo search algorithm. Find the optimal production rate (x) that minimizes the daily cost, given that the production rate should not exceed 100 units per day.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production rate (x) that minimizes the daily cost, we first need to find the derivative of the cost function C(x) with respect to x:\n\nC'(x) = d/dx (6000 + 3000x + 20x^2)\n\nC'(x) = 3000 + 40x\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3000 + 40x = 0\n\n40x = -3000\n\nx = -3000 / 40\n\nx = -75\n\nHowever, the production rate should not exceed 100 units per day, and it cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 100] to find the minimum cost.\n\nC(0) = 6000 + 3000(0) + 20(0)^2 = 6000\nC(100) = 6000 + 3000(100) + 20(100)^2 = 6000 + 300000 + 200000 = 506000\n\nSince C(0) is the lowest value, the optimal production rate that minimizes the daily cost is 0 units per day. However, this might not be a practical solution for the company, as it implies no production at all. In this case, the company should analyze its production constraints and requirements to determine a more suitable production rate."
