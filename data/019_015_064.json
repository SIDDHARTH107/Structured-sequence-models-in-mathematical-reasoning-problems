    "message_2": "In type theory, the successor function $S$ is used to represent the next number in the sequence. When you apply the successor function $S$ three times to the number 0, you get:\n\n1. $S(0)$, which represents 1.\n2. $S(S(0))$, which represents 2.\n3. $S(S(S(0)))$, which represents 3.\n\nSo, the result of applying the successor function $S$ three times to the number 0 in type theory is 3."
