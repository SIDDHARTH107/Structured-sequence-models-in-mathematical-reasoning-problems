    "message_2": "To find the Betti numbers of $S$, we first need to know the number of critical points of each index for the Morse function $f$. Let $n_i$ be the number of critical points of index $i$ for $i = 0, 1, 2$. Then, by Morse theory, the Betti numbers $b_i$ are given by:\n\n$b_0 = n_0$\n\n$b_1 = n_1 - n_0$\n\n$b_2 = n_2 - n_1 + n_0$\n\nSince $S$ is a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, we know that:\n\n$b_0 = 1$\n\n$b_1 = 2g$\n\n$b_2 = 1$\n\nNow, we can find the Euler characteristic $\\chi(S)$ using the Betti numbers:\n\n$\\chi(S) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2g + 1 = 2 - 2g$\n\nNext, we use the Morse inequalities to relate the number of critical points $k$ to the Betti numbers:\n\n$k = n_0 + n_1 + n_2 \\geq b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2g + 1 = 2g + 2$\n\nSince $k \\geq 2g + 2$, we have found the Betti numbers and the Euler characteristic of $S$ in terms of $g$ and $k$:\n\n$b_0 = 1$\n\n$b_1 = 2g$\n\n$b_2 = 1$\n\n$\\chi(S) = 2 - 2g$\n\n$k \\geq 2g + 2$"
