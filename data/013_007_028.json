    "message_1": "A group of six farmers own a piece of land commonly for grazing their cattle. The maximum number of cattle that can graze on the land is 18. If each farmer is incentivized to maximize their own profits, how many cows will each farmer send to the common land? What is the total number of cows that will graze on the land? Calculate the profits for each farmer assuming a cost of  $5 per cattle and market price of $10 per cattle.",
    "message_2": "If each farmer is incentivized to maximize their own profits, they will each send as many cows as possible to the common land. Since there are 6 farmers and a maximum of 18 cows can graze on the land, each farmer will send 18/6 = 3 cows to the common land.\n\nThe total number of cows that will graze on the land is 6 farmers * 3 cows per farmer = 18 cows.\n\nThe cost of raising each cow is $5, and the market price per cow is $10. Therefore, the profit per cow is $10 - $5 = $5.\n\nEach farmer has 3 cows, so their individual profit will be 3 cows * $5 profit per cow = $15.\n\nIn conclusion, each farmer will send 3 cows to the common land, and the total number of cows grazing will be 18. Each farmer will make a profit of $15."
