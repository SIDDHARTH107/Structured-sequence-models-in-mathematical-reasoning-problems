    "message_1": "In a group of five volunteers, each volunteer can choose to either donate $10 or not donate anything to a charity organization. The organization will receive a funding of $100 if at least three volunteers donate. \n\nIf the volunteers act according to their own self-interest, what is the probability that the organization receives the funding?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that the organization receives the funding, we need to consider all possible outcomes where at least three volunteers donate. There are two choices for each volunteer: donate or not donate. So, there are 2^5 = 32 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's find the number of outcomes where at least three volunteers donate:\n\n1. Three volunteers donate: There are 5C3 = 10 ways to choose three volunteers out of five.\n2. Four volunteers donate: There are 5C4 = 5 ways to choose four volunteers out of five.\n3. All five volunteers donate: There is only 1 way for this to happen.\n\nSo, there are a total of 10 + 5 + 1 = 16 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability that the organization receives the funding is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n\nP(at least three volunteers donate) = 16/32 = 1/2 or 50%."
