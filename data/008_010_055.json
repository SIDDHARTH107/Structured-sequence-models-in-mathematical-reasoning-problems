    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3 -1 |  7 |\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 3  2 -4 |  8 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we can replace the second row with (-1/2) * (first row) + (second row) and replace the third row with (-3/2) * (first row) + (third row):\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  7  |\n|  0  -2   2 | -4  |\n|  0  -2.5  2 |  0  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we can replace the third row with (-2.5/-2) * (second row) + (third row):\n\n|  2   3   -1 |  7  |\n|  0  -2    2 | -4  |\n|  0   0  -0.5|  4  |\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nWe can now solve for z by dividing the third row by -0.5:\n\n|  2   3   -1 |  7  |\n|  0  -2    2 | -4  |\n|  0   0    1 | -8  |\n\nSo, z = -8.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow we can substitute z back into the second row to solve for y:\n\n-2y + 2(-8) = -4\n-2y - 16 = -4\n-2y = 12\ny = -6\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we can substitute y and z back into the first row to solve for x:\n\n2x + 3(-6) - (-8) = 7\n2x - 18 + 8 = 7\n2x - 10 = 7\n2x = 17\nx = 8.5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 8.5, y = -6, and z = -8."
