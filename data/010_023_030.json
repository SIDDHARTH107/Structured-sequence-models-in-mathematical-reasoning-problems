    "message_2": "The problem statement contains a contradiction. The connected sum of three copies of the real projective plane (RP²) cannot form a closed, orientable 3-manifold. The real projective plane is a non-orientable surface, and the connected sum of non-orientable surfaces will also be non-orientable. \n\nHowever, if we consider the connected sum of three copies of the real projective space (RP³) instead, we can determine the fundamental group of the resulting 3-manifold.\n\nLet M = (RP³) # (RP³) # (RP³). We can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem to find the fundamental group of M. The theorem states that if a space X is the union of two open, path-connected subspaces A and B such that their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X, π₁(X), can be determined from the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B.\n\nLet A = (RP³) # (RP³) and B = (RP³) with A ∩ B being a 3-ball. Then, M = A ∪ B. The fundamental group of RP³ is Z₂ (the cyclic group of order 2), and the fundamental group of a 3-ball is trivial (i.e., the group with only the identity element).\n\nUsing the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we have:\n\nπ₁(M) = (π₁(A) * π₁(B)) / N\n\nwhere * denotes the free product of groups and N is the normal subgroup generated by the elements of π₁(A ∩ B) in π₁(A) * π₁(B).\n\nSince π₁(A) = Z₂ * Z₂, π₁(B) = Z₂, and π₁(A ∩ B) is trivial, we have:\n\nπ₁(M) = (Z₂ * Z₂ * Z₂) / (trivial group)\n\nThus, the fundamental group of M is the direct sum of three copies of Z₂:\n\nπ₁(M) = Z₂ ⊕ Z₂ ⊕ Z₂"
