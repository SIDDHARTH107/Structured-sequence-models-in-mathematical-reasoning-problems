    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 2.5 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (2.5)²\nSurface area = 4 * π * 6.25\nSurface area ≈ 4 * 3.14159 * 6.25\nSurface area ≈ 78.53975 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 2.5 cm is approximately 78.54 cm²."
