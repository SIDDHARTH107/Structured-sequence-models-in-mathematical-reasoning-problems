    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\n\"A 100 Newton force is applied to an object in the positive x-direction, as it moves along the x-axis from x=0 to x=10 meters. Find the work done by the force using integration.\" ",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we can use the following formula:\n\nWork = ∫(Force * dx) from x=0 to x=10\n\nIn this case, the force is constant (100 N) and is applied in the positive x-direction. So, the integral becomes:\n\nWork = ∫(100 dx) from x=0 to x=10\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nWork = [100x] from x=0 to x=10\n\nNext, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = (100 * 10) - (100 * 0)\nWork = 1000 - 0\nWork = 1000 J (Joules)\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 1000 Joules."
