    "message_2": "To partition a set of 5 distinct objects into 2 non-empty subsets, we can use the concept of combinations. We can choose a certain number of objects for the first subset, and the remaining objects will automatically form the second subset.\n\nFor a set of 5 distinct objects, we can choose 1, 2, 3, or 4 objects for the first subset (we can't choose 0 or 5 objects, as both subsets must be non-empty). \n\nThe number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n objects is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nSo, the number of ways to partition the set is:\n\nC(5, 1) + C(5, 2) + C(5, 3) + C(5, 4)\n\n= (5! / (1! * 4!)) + (5! / (2! * 3!)) + (5! / (3! * 2!)) + (5! / (4! * 1!))\n\n= (120 / (1 * 24)) + (120 / (2 * 6)) + (120 / (6 * 2)) + (120 / (24 * 1))\n\n= 5 + 10 + 10 + 5\n\n= 30\n\nSo, there are 30 ways to partition a set of 5 distinct objects into 2 non-empty subsets."
