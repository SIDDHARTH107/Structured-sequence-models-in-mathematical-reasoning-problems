    "message_2": "To find the mean, median, range, and standard deviation for the year, we will first organize the data and then perform the necessary calculations.\n\nMonthly sales data: 35, 42, 56, 72, 84, 95, 110, 125, 140, 148, 165, 178\n\n1. Mean sales for the year:\nMean = (Sum of all sales) / (Number of months)\nMean = (35 + 42 + 56 + 72 + 84 + 95 + 110 + 125 + 140 + 148 + 165 + 178) / 12\nMean = 1350 / 12\nMean = 112.5\n\n2. Median sales for the year:\nTo find the median, we first arrange the data in ascending order (which is already done) and then find the middle value(s).\n\nSince there are 12 months (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (6th and 7th values).\n\nMedian = (95 + 110) / 2\nMedian = 205 / 2\nMedian = 102.5\n\n3. Range for the year:\nRange = (Highest sales value) - (Lowest sales value)\nRange = 178 - 35\nRange = 143\n\n4. Standard deviation for the year:\nTo find the standard deviation, we first find the variance and then take the square root of the variance.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean (already done in step 1).\nStep 2: Subtract the mean from each value and square the result.\nStep 3: Find the average of these squared differences.\nStep 4: Take the square root of the result from step 3.\n\nVariance = [(35-112.5)^2 + (42-112.5)^2 + ... + (178-112.5)^2] / 12\nVariance = [6002.5 + 4900 + ... + 4282.5] / 12\nVariance = 32762.5 / 12\nVariance = 2730.208333\n\nStandard deviation = √Variance\nStandard deviation = √2730.208333\nStandard deviation ≈ 52.25\n\nSo, the mean sales for the year are 112.5, the median sales for the year are 102.5, the range for the year is 143, and the standard deviation for the year is approximately 52.25."
