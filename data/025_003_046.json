    "message_2": "To find the degree of the projective variety X, we first need to find the degree of each equation and then find the intersection points.\n\nThe first equation is x^2 - y^2 = 0, which can be factored as (x - y)(x + y) = 0. This equation represents two planes in the projective space, and each plane has degree 1.\n\nThe second equation is z^2 - x^2 = 0, which can be factored as (z - x)(z + x) = 0. This equation also represents two planes in the projective space, and each plane has degree 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points of these planes. There are four possible intersections:\n\n1. Intersection of (x - y) = 0 and (z - x) = 0: In this case, x = y and z = x, so the intersection point is [x:x:x] = [1:1:1].\n\n2. Intersection of (x - y) = 0 and (z + x) = 0: In this case, x = y and z = -x, so the intersection point is [x:x:-x] = [1:1:-1].\n\n3. Intersection of (x + y) = 0 and (z - x) = 0: In this case, x = -y and z = x, so the intersection point is [x:-x:x] = [1:-1:1].\n\n4. Intersection of (x + y) = 0 and (z + x) = 0: In this case, x = -y and z = -x, so the intersection point is [x:-x:-x] = [1:-1:-1].\n\nSince there are four distinct intersection points, the degree of the projective variety X is 4."
