    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected individual from this population has the condition, we need to divide the number of people with the condition by the total population.\n\nProbability = (Number of people with the condition) / (Total population)\n\nProbability = 100 / 1,000\n\nProbability = 0.1 or 10%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this population has the condition is 10%."
