    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of the sector, we need to find the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360°) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle, and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius is 5 cm, and the central angle is 60°. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60° / 360°) × 2π(5 cm)\nArc length = (1/6) × 10π cm\nArc length = 10π/6 cm\nArc length = 5π/3 cm\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = (5π/3 cm) + 2(5 cm)\nPerimeter = 5π/3 cm + 10 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is 5π/3 cm + 10 cm."
