    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, player A starts with $10 and can choose to send any amount between $0 and $10 to player B. The amount sent is then tripled, and player B can choose to send any portion of the tripled amount back to player A. For example, if player A sends $5, player B will receive $15 and can choose to send any amount between $0 and $15 back to player A. If player B chooses to send back $10, player A will end up with $25 ($10 sent initially + $15 received back).\n\nAssuming rationality and self-interest, what is the highest amount that player A should send in order to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "Assuming rationality and self-interest, player A should send $0 to player B.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Player B is rational and self-interested, so they will not send back any money to player A unless it benefits them.\n2. If player A sends any amount greater than $0, player B will receive a tripled amount. However, since player B is self-interested, they have no incentive to send any money back to player A, as keeping the entire tripled amount would maximize their own payoff.\n3. Knowing that player B will not send any money back, player A should not send any money in the first place, as they would only lose money in the process.\n\nSo, the highest amount that player A should send to maximize their own payoff is $0."
