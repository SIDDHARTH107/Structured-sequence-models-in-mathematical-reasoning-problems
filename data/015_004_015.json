    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is the largest, heart-shaped region in the center of the set. The border of the main cardioid is defined by the equation:\n\nr = 1 - cos(θ)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the origin to the border of the cardioid, and θ is the angle in polar coordinates.\n\nThe real part of the complex number at the border of the main cardioid can be found by converting the polar coordinates (r, θ) to rectangular coordinates (x, y):\n\nx = r * cos(θ)\ny = r * sin(θ)\n\nSince we are looking for the real part (x), we can substitute the equation for r:\n\nx = (1 - cos(θ)) * cos(θ)\n\nThe maximum value of x occurs when the derivative of x with respect to θ is zero:\n\nd(x)/d(θ) = 0\n\nSolving this equation for θ, we get:\n\nθ = π/2\n\nNow, we can find the maximum value of the real part (x) by plugging this value of θ back into the equation for x:\n\nx = (1 - cos(π/2)) * cos(π/2) = (1 - 0) * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the value of the real part of the complex number at the border of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is 0."
