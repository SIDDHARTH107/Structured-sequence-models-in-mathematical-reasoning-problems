    "message_1": "What is the probability that a network with 50 devices will experience at least one Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in a month, given that the average number of DDoS attacks per month for a single device is 0.1 and the attacks on each device are statistically independent?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one DDoS attack in a month for a network with 50 devices, we can first find the probability that none of the devices experience a DDoS attack and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single device does not experience a DDoS attack in a month is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSince the attacks on each device are statistically independent, the probability that none of the 50 devices experience a DDoS attack is (0.9)^50.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one DDoS attack by subtracting the probability of no attacks from 1:\n\nP(at least one DDoS attack) = 1 - P(no DDoS attacks) = 1 - (0.9)^50 â‰ˆ 0.994.\n\nSo, the probability that a network with 50 devices will experience at least one DDoS attack in a month is approximately 0.994 or 99.4%."
