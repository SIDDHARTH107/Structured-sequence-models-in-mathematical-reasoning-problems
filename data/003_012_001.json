    "message_1": "A person standing at the base of a hill observes that the angle of elevation to the top of the hill is 40 degrees. If the person walks 100 meters towards the hill and observes that the angle of elevation is now 60 degrees, what is the height of the hill?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the hill as h meters and the initial distance from the person to the base of the hill as x meters. We can use the tangent function to set up two equations based on the given information.\n\nFrom the first observation, we have:\n\ntan(40°) = h/x\n\nFrom the second observation, after the person walks 100 meters towards the hill, the distance from the person to the base of the hill is now (x - 100) meters. So, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = h/(x - 100)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables (h and x):\n\n1) h = x * tan(40°)\n2) h = (x - 100) * tan(60°)\n\nSince both expressions are equal to h, we can set them equal to each other:\n\nx * tan(40°) = (x - 100) * tan(60°)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. We know that tan(40°) ≈ 0.8391 and tan(60°) ≈ 1.7321. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n0.8391x = 1.7321(x - 100)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n0.8391x = 1.7321x - 173.21\n0.893x = 173.21\nx ≈ 193.92 meters\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the height of the hill using equation 1:\n\nh = 193.92 * tan(40°)\nh ≈ 193.92 * 0.8391\nh ≈ 162.72 meters\n\nSo, the height of the hill is approximately 162.72 meters."
