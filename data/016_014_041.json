    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve, we can use the formula for self-similar fractals:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/S)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Lévy C curve, each straight line segment is replaced by two segments (N = 2) of length a and b, respectively, where |a| + |b| = 1. Since the sum of the lengths of the two segments is equal to the length of the original segment, the scaling factor S is 1/2 (each new segment is half the length of the original segment).\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(2) / log(1/2)\n\nD ≈ 1.5849625\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 1.585."
