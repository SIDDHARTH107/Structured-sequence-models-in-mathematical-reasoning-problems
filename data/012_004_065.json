The distances between the cities are: \n\n| Cities | A | B | C | D | E | F |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A      | - | 6 | 1 | 5 | - | - |\n| B      | 6 | - | 5 | - | 3 | - |\n| C      | 1 | 5 | - | 5 | 6 | 4 |\n| D      | 5 | - | 5 | - | - | 2 |\n| E      | - | 3 | 6 | - | - | 6 |\n| F      | - | - | 4 | 2 | 6 | - |\n\nWhat is the minimum length of cable required to connect all the cities together optimally? Solve by finding the minimum spanning tree for the given graph.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum length of cable required to connect all the cities together optimally, we will use Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for the given graph.\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n   (A, C): 1\n   (D, F): 2\n   (B, E): 3\n   (C, F): 4\n   (A, D): 5\n   (B, C): 5\n   (C, D): 5\n   (C, E): 6\n   (A, B): 6\n   (E, F): 6\n\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n\n3. Add edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree.\n\n   Add (A, C): 1\n   Add (D, F): 2\n   Add (B, E): 3\n   Add (C, F): 4 (skip, as it would form a cycle with A, C, D, and F)\n   Add (A, D): 5\n   Add (B, C): 5\n\n4. The minimum spanning tree is now complete with the following edges and their weights:\n   (A, C): 1\n   (D, F): 2\n   (B, E): 3\n   (A, D): 5\n   (B, C): 5\n\n5. Calculate the total weight of the minimum spanning tree by adding the weights of all the edges:\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 16\n\nThe minimum length of cable required to connect all the cities together optimally is 16 units."
