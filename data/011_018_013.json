    "message_2": "Yes, the gardener can plant the flowers in such a way that each flower bed contains exactly 4 flowers, and each flower is in exactly one flower bed. \n\nSince there are 10 flower beds and each can accommodate 4 flowers, the total number of flowers that can be planted is 10 * 4 = 40 flowers. The gardener wants to plant 40 flowers, which is equal to the total capacity of the flower beds. Therefore, the gardener can plant the flowers as desired."
