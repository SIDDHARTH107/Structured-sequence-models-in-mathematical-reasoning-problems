    "message_1": "Consider the decision problem of 3-SAT, which is known to be NP-complete, where we are given a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form with at most 3 literals in each clause. \n\nLet's suppose we have an instance of 3-SAT with 20 variables and 70 clauses. What is the minimum number of steps required for an algorithm to solve this instance in the worst-case scenario, assuming the algorithm runs in constant time per step?",
    "message_2": "In the worst-case scenario, an algorithm would need to check all possible assignments of truth values to the 20 variables to determine if there is a satisfying assignment for the given 3-SAT instance. Since there are 2 possible truth values (True or False) for each variable, there are 2^20 possible assignments.\n\nTherefore, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm would need a minimum of 2^20 steps to solve the instance, assuming it runs in constant time per step. This is equal to 1,048,576 steps."
