    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)³\n\nV = (4/3)π(125)\n\nV = (500/3)π\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
