    "message_1": "Sorry, it is not possible to create a precise numerical problem for epistemic logic since it deals with knowledge and beliefs rather than numerical values. Epistemic logic is a system of reasoning that involves knowledge, belief, and uncertainty. It is more concerned with the relationship between statements than the actual values of those statements. However, I could create a question related to epistemic logic that a math student could solve. For example:\n\nSuppose there are two mathematicians, Alice and Bob. Alice knows that the answer to a mathematical problem is either 3 or 5, but she doesn't know which one. Bob knows that Alice doesn't know the answer. What can we conclude about the answer to the problem?",
    "message_2": "Since Bob knows that Alice doesn't know the answer, this implies that there is some information that Bob has which prevents the answer from being uniquely determined by Alice's knowledge. If the answer were 3 or 5, and Alice knew this, then Bob would not be able to conclude that Alice doesn't know the answer, because there would be a possibility that Alice knows the correct answer.\n\nHowever, since Bob is certain that Alice doesn't know the answer, this means that the answer cannot be uniquely determined by the information Alice has. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about the answer to the problem based on the given information."
