    "message_2": "To factor the given quadratic polynomial expression, we look for two binomials that when multiplied together will give us the original expression. We can use the factoring method called \"factoring by grouping.\"\n\nx^2 + 6x + 9\n\nFirst, identify the factors of the constant term (9) that add up to the coefficient of the linear term (6). In this case, the factors are 3 and 3, since 3 * 3 = 9 and 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nNow, rewrite the expression as a product of two binomials:\n\n(x + 3)(x + 3)\n\nSince both binomials are the same, we can also write the factored expression as:\n\n(x + 3)^2\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial expression x^2 + 6x + 9 is (x + 3)^2."
