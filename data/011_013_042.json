    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet's denote the colors as A, B, and C.\n\n1. We can color the vertices of the square using all 3 colors: There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the colors in this case.\n\n2. We can color the vertices of the square using exactly 2 colors: There are 3 ways to choose the pair of colors (AB, AC, or BC). For each pair, we have 2^4 = 16 possible colorings (each vertex can be one of the two colors). However, this includes the cases where all vertices are the same color, which we need to exclude. There are 2 such cases for each pair of colors (all A or all B, all A or all C, and all B or all C). So, there are 3 * (16 - 2) = 42 ways to color the vertices using exactly 2 colors.\n\n3. We can color the vertices of the square using only 1 color: There are 3 ways to do this (all A, all B, or all C).\n\nNow, we add up the cases:\n\nUsing all 3 colors: 6 ways\nUsing exactly 2 colors: 42 ways\nUsing only 1 color: 3 ways\n\nTotal number of ways to color the vertices of a square using at most 3 colors: 6 + 42 + 3 = 51 ways."
