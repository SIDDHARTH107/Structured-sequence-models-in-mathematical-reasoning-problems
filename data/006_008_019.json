    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in January)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day), which is 0.35\n- n is the number of trials (days in January), which is 31\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days), which is at least 20\n\nSince we want to find the probability of it raining on at least 20 days, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 31.\n\nP(X >= 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + ... + P(X = 31)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and then sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 20) = Σ [C(31, k) * 0.35^k * (1-0.35)^(31-k)] for k = 20 to 31\n\nP(X >= 20) ≈ 0.129\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on at least 20 days in January is approximately 0.129 or 12.9%."
