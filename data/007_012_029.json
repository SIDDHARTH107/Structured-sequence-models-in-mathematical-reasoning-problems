    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod p). In other words, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nWe want to find the least positive integer n > 1 such that (n-1)! is divisible by n. Let's test some values of n:\n\n1. If n = 2, then (2-1)! = 1! = 1, which is not divisible by 2.\n2. If n = 3, then (3-1)! = 2! = 2, which is not divisible by 3.\n3. If n = 4, then (4-1)! = 3! = 6, which is divisible by 4.\n\nThus, the least positive integer greater than 1 for which the factorial of n minus one is divisible by n is n = 4."
