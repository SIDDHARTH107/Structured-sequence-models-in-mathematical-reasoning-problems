    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to rewrite the given system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |      x = | x |      b = | 13 |\n    | 2  5  2 |          | y |          | 21 |\n    | 3  2  7 |          | z |          | 24 |\n\nNow, we need to check if the matrix A is symmetric and positive definite. A matrix is symmetric if A = A^T (transpose of A). In this case, A is symmetric:\n\nA^T = | 1  2  3 |\n      | 2  5  2 |\n      | 3  2  7 |\n\nA matrix is positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive. The eigenvalues of A are approximately 10.49, 2.51, and 0.004. Since all eigenvalues are positive, A is positive definite.\n\nNow we can proceed with the Cholesky decomposition. We need to find a lower triangular matrix L such that A = LL^T. The elements of L can be calculated as follows:\n\nL11 = sqrt(A11) = sqrt(1) = 1\nL21 = A21 / L11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nL31 = A31 / L11 = 3 / 1 = 3\nL22 = sqrt(A22 - L21^2) = sqrt(5 - 2^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\nL32 = (A32 - L31 * L21) / L22 = (2 - 3 * 2) / 1 = -4\nL33 = sqrt(A33 - L31^2 - L32^2) = sqrt(7 - 3^2 - (-4)^2) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, L = | 1  0  0 |\n        | 2  1  0 |\n        | 3 -4  sqrt(2) |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n1 * y1 = 13 => y1 = 13\n2 * y1 + 1 * y2 = 21 => y2 = 21 - 2 * 13 = -5\n3 * y1 - 4 * y2 + sqrt(2) * y3 = 24 => y3 = (24 - 3 * 13 + 4 * 5) / sqrt(2) = 2\n\nSo, y = | 13 |\n        | -5 |\n        |  2 |\n\nFinally, we need to solve the system L^T x = y for x:\n\n1 * x1 = 13 => x1 = 13\n2 * x1 + 1 * x2 = -5 => x2 = -5 - 2 * 13 = -31\n3 * x1 - 4 * x2 + sqrt(2) * x3 = 2 => x3 = (2 - 3 * 13 + 4 * 31) / sqrt(2) = 1\n\nSo, x = | 13 |\n        | -31 |\n        |  1 |\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 13, y = -31, and z = 1."
