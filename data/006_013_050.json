    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a tornado occurring in a specific region based on historical data, we can use the following formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of tornadoes in the past) / (Total number of years)\n\nIn this case, there have been 8 tornadoes in the past 50 years. So, the probability of a tornado occurring in this region is:\n\nProbability = 8 / 50 = 0.16\n\nTherefore, the probability of a tornado occurring in this specific region is 0.16 or 16%."
