    "message_2": "To show that the open cover {(-1/n, 1/n)}_{n=1}^∞ has no finite subcover, we will prove it by contradiction. Suppose there exists a finite subcover of the open cover {(-1/n, 1/n)}_{n=1}^∞ that covers the space X = [-1, 1]. Let this finite subcover be {(-1/n_i, 1/n_i)}_{i=1}^k for some positive integers n_1, n_2, ..., n_k.\n\nSince the subcover is finite, there must exist a largest integer N among n_1, n_2, ..., n_k. In other words, N = max{n_1, n_2, ..., n_k}. Now consider the interval (-1/N, 1/N). By definition of N, we have that 1/N <= 1/n_i for all i = 1, 2, ..., k.\n\nNow, let's consider the point x = -1. Since x is in the space X, it must be covered by the finite subcover {(-1/n_i, 1/n_i)}_{i=1}^k. However, for all i = 1, 2, ..., k, we have -1 < -1/n_i, which means that x = -1 is not covered by any of the intervals in the finite subcover.\n\nThis is a contradiction, as we assumed that the finite subcover covers the space X. Therefore, the open cover {(-1/n, 1/n)}_{n=1}^∞ has no finite subcover."
