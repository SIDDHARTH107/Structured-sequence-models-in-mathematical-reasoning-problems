    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the resulting surface, we first need to find the equation of the plane that cuts the cylinder obliquely.\n\nLet the equation of the plane be ax + by + cz = d. Since the plane just grazes the cylinder, it must be tangent to the cylinder at the given point (2 cm from the base). Let's assume that the point of tangency is P(x1, y1, z1).\n\nThe equation of the cylinder is x^2 + y^2 = r^2, where r = 3 cm. Since the height of the cylinder is 8 cm, we know that 0 ≤ z ≤ 8.\n\nAt the point P, we have x1^2 + y1^2 = 9 (since r = 3). Now, we need to find the normal vector to the plane, which is also the normal vector to the cylinder at the point P. The gradient of the cylinder's equation is ∇(x^2 + y^2) = (2x, 2y), so the normal vector at P is (2x1, 2y1).\n\nNow, we can use the point-normal form of the plane's equation: a(x - x1) + b(y - y1) + c(z - z1) = 0. Since the normal vector is (2x1, 2y1), we have:\n\n2x1(x - x1) + 2y1(y - y1) + c(z - z1) = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x1, y1, z1, and c. Since the point P is 2 cm from the base of the cylinder, we know that z1 = 2. We also know that x1^2 + y1^2 = 9. We can use the fact that the plane is tangent to the cylinder to find the remaining values.\n\nLet's consider the intersection of the plane and the cylinder. The intersection will be an ellipse, and since the plane is tangent to the cylinder, the ellipse will have a semi-minor axis of length 0. This means that the intersection is actually a circle, and the plane is parallel to the xy-plane.\n\nSince the plane is parallel to the xy-plane, its normal vector must have a z-component of 0. Therefore, c = 0. Now, we have:\n\n2x1(x - x1) + 2y1(y - y1) = 0.\n\nWe still need to find x1 and y1. Since x1^2 + y1^2 = 9, we can try some possible values. One possibility is x1 = 3 and y1 = 0. This gives us the equation:\n\n6(x - 3) = 0, or x = 3.\n\nThis means that the plane's equation is x = 3, and the resulting surface is a plane parallel to the yz-plane. The sectional curvature of a plane is always 0, so the sectional curvature of the resulting surface at the given point is 0.00."
