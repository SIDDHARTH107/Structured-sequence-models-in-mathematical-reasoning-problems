    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and find the points where all of them vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet $f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = -2z$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$2x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\n$-2z = 0$\n\nThe solution to this system is the point $(0, 0, 0)$. Thus, the algebraic variety has a singular point at the origin.\n\nTo determine the type of singularity, we can compute the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives and analyze its signature:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe Hessian matrix has two positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue. This means that the singularity at the origin is a saddle point, which is a type of degenerate singularity. In the context of algebraic geometry, this type of singularity is called a \"hyperbolic\" or \"cone\" singularity."
