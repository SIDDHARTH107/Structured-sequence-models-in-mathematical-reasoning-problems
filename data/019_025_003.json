    "message_1": "A factory produces 20 units of a product when 4 machines are working. If 2 machines are not working today, how many units of the product will be produced?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find out how many units are produced by one machine. Since 4 machines produce 20 units, we can divide the total units by the number of machines to find the units produced by one machine:\n\n20 units / 4 machines = 5 units per machine\n\nNow, if 2 machines are not working today, that means there are only 2 working machines. To find out how many units these 2 machines will produce, we can multiply the units produced by one machine by the number of working machines:\n\n5 units per machine * 2 machines = 10 units\n\nSo, 10 units of the product will be produced today."
