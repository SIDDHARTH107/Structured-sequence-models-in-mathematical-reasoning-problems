    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - x^2 - 2x + 2, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = x^3 - x^2 - 2x + 2\n\nWe can try to factor the equation to make it easier to solve. First, we can factor out an x:\n\nx(x^2 - x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can try to factor the quadratic inside the parentheses:\n\nx(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx = 0\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx + 1 = 0 => x = -1\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation are x = 0, x = 2, and x = -1."
