    "message_2": "To solve the equation (5/x) + 3 = (2/x) - 1, we first want to get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the common denominator, which is x. \n\nx * [(5/x) + 3] = x * [(2/x) - 1]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5 + 3x = 2 - x\n\nNow, we want to isolate x. To do this, we'll add x to both sides of the equation:\n\n5 + 3x + x = 2 - x + x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5 + 4x = 2\n\nNext, we'll subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n4x = -3\n\nFinally, we'll divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:\n\nx = -3/4"
