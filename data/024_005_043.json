    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature (K) of a surface at any point is given by the product of its principal curvatures, k₁ and k₂. In this case, both principal curvatures are given as k₁ = k₂ = 0.\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature K = k₁ * k₂ = 0 * 0 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the Gaussian curvature at any point on the cylindrical surface is 0."
