    "message_2": "As a language model AI, I cannot directly display graphical representations. However, I can guide you through the process of finding the real roots of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x + 8 using a graph.\n\n1. First, you need to sketch the graph of the given polynomial equation. You can use graphing software or online tools like Desmos, GeoGebra, or Wolfram Alpha to plot the graph.\n\n2. Observe the graph and look for the points where the curve intersects the x-axis. These points represent the real roots of the equation since at these points, the value of y is 0.\n\n3. If the graph intersects the x-axis at distinct points, you can read off the approximate values of the real roots from the graph. If the graph touches the x-axis at a single point, it means there is a repeated root.\n\n4. For a more accurate result, you can use numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson method or the bisection method to find the exact values of the real roots.\n\nFor the given polynomial equation y = x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x + 8, after plotting the graph, you will find that it intersects the x-axis at three distinct points. These points represent the real roots of the equation."
