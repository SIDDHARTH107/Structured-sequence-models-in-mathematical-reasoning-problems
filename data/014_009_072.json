    "message_1": "Suppose you have a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. If the number of rounds used in the cipher is 16, how many subkeys are generated from the original key during the key schedule process?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, a subkey is generated for each round of the encryption process. Since there are 16 rounds in this cipher, 16 subkeys will be generated from the original 128-bit key during the key schedule process."
