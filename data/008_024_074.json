    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the system of linear equations by eliminating one variable. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2 and then subtracting the second equation from the result:\n\n(2 * (2x + y - 3z)) - (4x + 2y - 6z) = (2 * 7) - 14\n4x + 2y - 6z - 4x - 2y + 6z = 0\n0 = 0\n\nSince the second equation is a multiple of the first equation, we can see that these two equations are dependent, and they represent the same plane in 3D space. Now, let's eliminate one variable from the first and third equations:\n\nx + y - 2z = 5 - (2x + y - 3z) = -x + z = -2\nx - z = 2\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\n2x + y - 3z = 7\nx - z = 2\n\nLet's solve for x in the second equation:\n\nx = z + 2\n\nNow substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n2(z + 2) + y - 3z = 7\n2z + 4 + y - 3z = 7\n-y + z = 3\n\nNow we have:\n\nx = z + 2\ny = z - 3\n\nSince there is no unique solution for z, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. The solutions can be expressed in parametric form as:\n\nx = z + 2\ny = z - 3\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
