    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then find the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we'll divide each of these determinants by D to get the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe coefficient matrix and its determinant (D) are as follows:\n\n```\n| 2 -3  4 | \n| 1  5 -2 | \n| 3  2 -6 | \n\nD = 2(5 * -6 - (-2) * 2) - (-3)(1 * -6 - (-2) * 3) + 4(1 * 2 - 5 * 3)\nD = 2(-30 + 4) + 3(6 + 6) + 4(2 - 15)\nD = 2(-26) + 3(12) + 4(-13)\nD = -52 + 36 - 52\nD = -68\n```\n\nNow, let's find the determinant Dx by replacing the first column with the constants:\n\n```\n| 7 -3  4 | \n| 3  5 -2 | \n|-1  2 -6 | \n\nDx = 7(5 * -6 - (-2) * 2) - (-3)(3 * -6 - (-2) * (-1)) + 4(3 * 2 - 5 * (-1))\nDx = 7(-30 + 4) + 3(18 - 2) + 4(6 + 5)\nDx = 7(-26) + 3(16) + 4(11)\nDx = -182 + 48 + 44\nDx = -90\n```\n\nNow, let's find the determinant Dy by replacing the second column with the constants:\n\n```\n| 2  7  4 | \n| 1  3 -2 | \n| 3 -1 -6 | \n\nDy = 2(3 * -6 - (-2) * (-1)) - 7(1 * -6 - (-2) * 3) + 4(1 * (-1) - 3 * 3)\nDy = 2(-18 - 2) - 7(-6 + 6) + 4(-1 - 9)\nDy = 2(-20) - 7(0) + 4(-10)\nDy = -40 - 40\nDy = -80\n```\n\nFinally, let's find the determinant Dz by replacing the third column with the constants:\n\n```\n| 2 -3  7 | \n| 1  5  3 | \n| 3  2 -1 | \n\nDz = 2(5 * -1 - 3 * 2) - (-3)(1 * -1 - 3 * (-1)) + 7(1 * 2 - 5 * 3)\nDz = 2(-5 - 6) + 3(1 + 3) + 7(2 - 15)\nDz = 2(-11) + 3(4) + 7(-13)\nDz = -22 + 12 - 91\nDz = -101\n```\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z by dividing Dx, Dy, and Dz by D:\n\nx = Dx / D = -90 / -68 = 45 / 34\ny = Dy / D = -80 / -68 = 40 / 34 = 20 / 17\nz = Dz / D = -101 / -68\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 45/34\ny = 20/17\nz = 101/68"
