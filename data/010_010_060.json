    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y)$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the function with respect to $x$ and $y$. Let's compute these partial derivatives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x + 3x^2 - 3y\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y - 3x\n$$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations to find the critical points:\n\n$$\n2x + 3x^2 - 3y = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n2y - 3x = 0\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$:\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{3}{2}x\n$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation:\n\n$$\n2x + 3x^2 - 3\\left(\\frac{3}{2}x\\right) = 0\n$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$\n2x + 3x^2 - \\frac{9}{2}x = 0\n$$\n\nFactor out $x$:\n\n$$\nx(2 + 3x - \\frac{9}{2}) = 0\n$$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$:\n\n1. $x = 0$, in which case $y = \\frac{3}{2}(0) = 0$. So, one critical point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n2. $2 + 3x - \\frac{9}{2} = 0$, which implies $3x = \\frac{5}{2}$, and $x = \\frac{5}{6}$. In this case, $y = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{5}{4}$. However, this point is not in the interior of $D$, since $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 > 1$.\n\nThus, there is only one critical point of $f$ in the interior of $D$, which is $(0, 0)$."
