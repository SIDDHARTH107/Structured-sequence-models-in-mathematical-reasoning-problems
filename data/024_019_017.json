    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total Gaussian curvature of a surface to its topological properties. For a sphere, the theorem states that the total Gaussian curvature K is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic χ of the sphere:\n\nK = 2πχ\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a sphere is 2, so we have:\n\nK = 2π(2) = 4π\n\nNow, the Gaussian curvature at any point on a sphere of radius r is given by the formula:\n\nk = 1/r^2\n\nIn our case, the radius r is 5 cm, so the Gaussian curvature at any point is:\n\nk = 1/(5^2) = 1/25 cm^(-2)\n\nTo find the total Gaussian curvature of the sphere, we need to integrate the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface of the sphere. Since the Gaussian curvature is constant over the sphere, we can simply multiply the Gaussian curvature at any point by the surface area of the sphere:\n\nK = k * Surface Area\n\nThe surface area of a sphere with radius r is given by the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4πr^2\n\nSo, the surface area of our sphere with radius 5 cm is:\n\nSurface Area = 4π(5^2) = 100π cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total Gaussian curvature of the sphere:\n\nK = k * Surface Area = (1/25 cm^(-2)) * (100π cm^2) = 4π\n\nThus, the total Gaussian curvature of the sphere with radius 5 cm is 4π."
