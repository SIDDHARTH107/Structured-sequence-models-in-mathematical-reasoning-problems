    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using Gaussian elimination, we first need to form an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3  1 |  7 |\n| 1 -2  4 | -5 |\n| 3 -1 -1 |  6 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner.\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -5 |\n| 2  3  1 |  7 |\n| 3 -1 -1 |  6 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 3 below the 1 in the first column. To do this, replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and replace Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3.\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -5 |\n| 0  7 -7 | 17 |\n| 0  5 -11| 21 |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 7 to get a 1 in the second row and second column.\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -5 |\n| 0  1 -1 | 17/7 |\n| 0  5 -11| 21 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 5 below the 1 in the second column. To do this, replace Row 3 with (-5 * Row 2) + Row 3.\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -5 |\n| 0  1 -1 | 17/7 |\n| 0  0  6 | 16/7 |\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by 6 to get a 1 in the third row and third column.\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -5 |\n| 0  1 -1 | 17/7 |\n| 0  0  1 | 8/21 |\n\nStep 6: Use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z. Start with the last row and work upwards.\n\nz = 8/21\n\ny = 17/7 + z = 17/7 + 8/21 = (51 + 8)/21 = 59/21\n\nx = -5 + 2y - 4z = -5 + 2(59/21) - 4(8/21) = (-105 + 118 - 32)/21 = -19/21\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = -19/21\ny = 59/21\nz = 8/21"
