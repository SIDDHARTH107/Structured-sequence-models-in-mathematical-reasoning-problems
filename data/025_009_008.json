    "message_2": "To calculate the dimension of the moduli space X of smooth projective curves of genus 3, we can use the formula for the dimension of the moduli space of curves of genus g:\n\ndim(X) = 3g - 3\n\nIn our case, the genus g is 3, so we can plug this value into the formula:\n\ndim(X) = 3(3) - 3\ndim(X) = 9 - 3\ndim(X) = 6\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the moduli space of smooth projective curves of genus 3 is 6."
