    "message_1": "A company wants to study the effectiveness of a new fertilizer on the growth of corn. The company divided a 25-acre field into 5 plots of equal size and randomly assigned the new fertilizer to one plot. They used the standard fertilizer on the other four plots. At the end of the growing season, they measured the corn yield in bushels per acre for each plot. The company wants to test whether the new fertilizer is effective or not using a significance level of 0.05. What statistical test should they use, and what is the value of the test statistic? \n\nThe following are the corn yields (in bushels per acre): \n\nPlot 1 (new fertilizer): 156, 180, 162, 168, 174, 186, 152, 175, 182, 180 \n\nPlot 2: 146, 150, 148, 142, 158, 138, 140, 156, 152, 144 \n\nPlot 3: 139, 144, 152, 156, 135, 146, 148, 135, 138, 142 \n\nPlot 4: 144, 138, 140, 132, 136, 138, 148, 142, 146, 152 \n\nPlot 5: 170, 178, 184, 162, 176, 168, 180, 172, 166, 178",
    "message_2": "To test whether the new fertilizer is effective or not, we can use a one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test. This test compares the means of the different groups (in this case, the plots) to determine if there is a significant difference between them.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean and variance for each plot:\n\nPlot 1 (new fertilizer): Mean = 171.5, Variance = 116.722\nPlot 2: Mean = 148.2, Variance = 43.066\nPlot 3: Mean = 143.5, Variance = 54.5\nPlot 4: Mean = 141.6, Variance = 21.822\nPlot 5: Mean = 173.4, Variance = 43.822\n\nNext, we calculate the overall mean (grand mean) of all the plots:\n\nGrand Mean = (171.5 + 148.2 + 143.5 + 141.6 + 173.4) / 5 = 155.64\n\nNow, we calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) and Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW):\n\nSSB = Σ(n_i * (mean_i - grand_mean)^2) = 10 * ((171.5 - 155.64)^2 + (148.2 - 155.64)^2 + (143.5 - 155.64)^2 + (141.6 - 155.64)^2 + (173.4 - 155.64)^2) = 10 * (251.104 + 55.411 + 147.635 + 196.963 + 315.056) = 9651.69\n\nSSW = Σ(variance_i * (n_i - 1)) = (116.722 * 9) + (43.066 * 9) + (54.5 * 9) + (21.822 * 9) + (43.822 * 9) = 2520.3\n\nNow, we calculate the degrees of freedom for SSB (df1) and SSW (df2):\n\ndf1 = number of groups - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4\ndf2 = total number of observations - number of groups = 50 - 5 = 45\n\nNext, we calculate the Mean Square Between Groups (MSB) and Mean Square Within Groups (MSW):\n\nMSB = SSB / df1 = 9651.69 / 4 = 2412.922\nMSW = SSW / df2 = 2520.3 / 45 = 56.007\n\nNow, we calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 2412.922 / 56.007 = 43.085\n\nFinally, we compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table with (df1, df2) degrees of freedom at a significance level of 0.05. The critical value for (4, 45) is approximately 2.58.\n\nSince the F-statistic (43.085) is greater than the critical value (2.58), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the means of the different plots. This suggests that the new fertilizer is effective in increasing corn yield."
