    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, V = 10 and E = 15. We can rearrange the formula to find F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E = 2 - 10 + 15 = 7\n\nHowever, we also need to check if the graph is non-planar. A graph is non-planar if it doesn't satisfy the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nFor our graph, we have:\n\n15 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph could be planar. However, we need to check if the graph can be embedded in a surface of higher genus (i.e., a surface with more \"holes\" than a plane). The genus g of a graph can be found using the formula:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to find g:\n\ng ≥ (E - 3V + 6) / 6\n\nFor our graph, we have:\n\ng ≥ (15 - 3(10) + 6) / 6\ng ≥ (-15) / 6\n\nSince the genus cannot be negative, the minimum genus for the graph is 0, which means the graph is planar. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 0."
