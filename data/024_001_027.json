    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve at t = 1, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the vector-valued function r(t).\n\nr(t) = (3t^2 - 2, 4t - 3, t^2 + 2t + 1)\n\nFirst derivative:\nr'(t) = (6t, 4, 2t + 2)\n\nSecond derivative:\nr''(t) = (6, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate r'(t) and r''(t) at t = 1:\n\nr'(1) = (6, 4, 4)\nr''(1) = (6, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we need to find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) using the following formulas:\n\nCurvature (k) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\nTorsion (τ) = (r'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t))) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product of r'(1) and r''(1):\n\nr'(1) x r''(1) = (4 * 2 - 4 * 0, 4 * 6 - 6 * 2, 6 * 0 - 6 * 4)\nr'(1) x r''(1) = (8, 12, -24)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of r'(1) and r'(1) x r''(1):\n\n||r'(1)|| = √(6^2 + 4^2 + 4^2) = √(36 + 16 + 16) = √68\n||r'(1) x r''(1)|| = √(8^2 + 12^2 + (-24)^2) = √(64 + 144 + 576) = √784 = 28\n\nNow we can find the curvature (k):\n\nk = ||r'(1) x r''(1)|| / ||r'(1)||^3\nk = 28 / (68^(3/2))\nk ≈ 0.171\n\nNext, let's find the dot product of r'(1) and r'(1) x r''(1):\n\nr'(1) • (r'(1) x r''(1)) = 6 * 8 + 4 * 12 + 4 * (-24)\nr'(1) • (r'(1) x r''(1)) = 48 - 96 = -48\n\nNow we can find the torsion (τ):\n\nτ = (r'(1) • (r'(1) x r''(1))) / ||r'(1) x r''(1)||^2\nτ = -48 / (28^2)\nτ ≈ -0.061\n\nSo, the curvature of the curve at t = 1 is approximately 0.171, and the torsion is approximately -0.061."
