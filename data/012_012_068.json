    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of graph G with 9 vertices and 12 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. First, we need to find the minimum degree of the graph. Since the graph has 9 vertices and 12 edges, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 12) / 9 â‰ˆ 2.67. Therefore, the minimum degree of the graph must be at least 2.\n\n2. Now, let's consider the possible cycles in the graph. The shortest cycle is a triangle (3-cycle). If the graph has a triangle, then the girth is 3. If not, we will consider 4-cycles, and so on.\n\n3. Let's check if there is a triangle in the graph. If there is a vertex with a degree of at least 3, then by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be a triangle in the graph. This is because if a vertex has 3 neighbors, at least two of them must be connected, forming a triangle with the original vertex.\n\nSince the minimum degree of the graph is at least 2, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more. Therefore, there must be a triangle in the graph, and the girth of the graph G is 3."
