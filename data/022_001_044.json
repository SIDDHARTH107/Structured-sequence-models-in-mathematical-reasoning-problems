    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of $f(z) = \\sqrt{z^2 + 1}$ onto the open lower half-plane $\\mathbb{H'}$, we first need to define a branch of the square root function that is continuous and analytic on $\\mathbb{H'}$.\n\nLet's consider the principal branch of the square root function, defined as:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{w} = \\sqrt{|w|}e^{i\\arg(w)/2},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\arg(w)$ is the principal argument of $w$ such that $-\\pi < \\arg(w) \\leq \\pi$. This branch is continuous and analytic on the complex plane except for the negative real axis.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(z) = z^2 + 1$. This function maps the open lower half-plane $\\mathbb{H'}$ to the right half-plane, excluding the origin. Therefore, we can define the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ on $\\mathbb{H'}$ as:\n\n$$\nf'(z) = \\sqrt{g(z)} = \\sqrt{|g(z)|}e^{i\\arg(g(z))/2}.\n$$\n\nSince $g(z)$ is continuous and analytic on $\\mathbb{H'}$, and the principal branch of the square root function is continuous and analytic on the right half-plane, $f'(z)$ is continuous and analytic on $\\mathbb{H'}$.\n\nThus, the analytic continuation of $f(z) = \\sqrt{z^2 + 1}$ onto the open lower half-plane $\\mathbb{H'}$ is given by:\n\n$$\nf'(z) = \\sqrt{|z^2 + 1|}e^{i\\arg(z^2 + 1)/2}.\n$$"
