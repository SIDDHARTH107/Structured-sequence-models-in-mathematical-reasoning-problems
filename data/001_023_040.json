    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to find the angles whose sine value is 0.5 within the given range of 0 to 360 degrees.\n\nsin(x) = 0.5\n\nThe sine function has a positive value in the first and second quadrants. We can use the arcsine (inverse sine) function to find the angle in the first quadrant:\n\nx = arcsin(0.5)\n\nx ≈ 30 degrees\n\nNow, we need to find the angle in the second quadrant. Since sine is positive in the second quadrant, we can find the supplementary angle to 30 degrees:\n\nx = 180 - 30\n\nx = 150 degrees\n\nSo, the two angles x within the range of 0 to 360 degrees that satisfy the equation sin(x) = 0.5 are x ≈ 30 degrees and x = 150 degrees."
