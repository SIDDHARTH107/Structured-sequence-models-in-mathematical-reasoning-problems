    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to identify the best responses for each player given the other player's strategy.\n\nFor Player A:\n- If Player B chooses strategy W, Player A's best response is strategy X (3 > 1).\n- If Player B chooses strategy X, Player A's best response is strategy X (5 > 2).\n- If Player B chooses strategy Z, Player A's best response is strategy Y (3 > 0).\n\nFor Player B:\n- If Player A chooses strategy X, Player B's best response is strategy W (3 > 1 and 3 > 0).\n- If Player A chooses strategy Y, Player B's best response is strategy Z (3 > 2 and 3 > 5).\n\nNow, we look for the strategies where both players are playing their best responses. The Nash Equilibrium is at the intersection of these strategies.\n\nIn this case, the Nash Equilibrium is when Player A chooses strategy X and Player B chooses strategy W, with the payoff (3, 3)."
