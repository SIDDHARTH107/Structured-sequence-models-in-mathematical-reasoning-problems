    "message_1": "Consider the Rail fence cipher with 3 rails which resulted in the encrypted message \"HEOLWRDLOLLE\". Using cryptanalysis techniques, determine the original message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt a Rail Fence cipher with 3 rails, we can reverse the encryption process. The encrypted message is \"HEOLWRDLOLLE\". We can arrange the letters in the following pattern:\n\nH . . . O . . . L . . . L\n. E . L . W . R . D . O .\n. . O . . . L . . . E . .\n\nNow, we can read the original message by following the zigzag pattern:\n\nHELLO_WORLD\n\nSo, the original message is \"HELLO WORLD\"."
