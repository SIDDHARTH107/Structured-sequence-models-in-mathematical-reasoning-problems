    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first convert the given values into SI units and then apply the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box.\n\nGiven:\nMass of the particle, m = 2 kg\nWidth of the box, L = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box is given by:\n\nΨ(x) = √(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere Ψ(x) is the wave function, n is the quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), and L is the width of the box.\n\nThe energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional box are given by:\n\nE_n = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the particle at the nth level, h is the Planck's constant (h = 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), m is the mass of the particle, and L is the width of the box.\n\nNow, let's find the energy levels of the particle:\n\nE_n = (n^2 * (6.626 × 10^(-34))^2) / (8 * 2 * (0.1 × 10^(-9))^2)\n\nE_n = (n^2 * 4.39 × 10^(-68)) / (1.6 × 10^(-19))\n\nE_n = 2.74 × 10^(-49) * n^2\n\nTo find the energy levels in electron volts (eV), we can divide the energy by the charge of an electron (1.6 × 10^(-19) C):\n\nE_n (eV) = (2.74 × 10^(-49) * n^2) / (1.6 × 10^(-19))\n\nE_n (eV) = 1.71 × 10^(-30) * n^2\n\nThe energy levels of the particle in electron volts are given by:\n\nE_n (eV) = 1.71 × 10^(-30) * n^2\n\nThe wave function for the particle in the one-dimensional box is:\n\nΨ(x) = √(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nΨ(x) = √(2/0.1 × 10^(-9)) * sin(nπx/(0.1 × 10^(-9)))\n\nΨ(x) = √(20 × 10^9) * sin(nπx/0.1 × 10^(-9))\n\nΨ(x) = √(2 × 10^(10)) * sin(10 * nπx)"
