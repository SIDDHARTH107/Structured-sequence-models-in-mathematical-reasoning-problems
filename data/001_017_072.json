    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+5) + log(x-5) = 1, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\n1. Combine the logarithms using the product rule: log(a) + log(b) = log(ab)\n\nlog((x+5)(x-5)) = 1\n\n2. Convert the equation from logarithmic form to exponential form:\n\n10^1 = (x+5)(x-5)\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n\n10 = (x^2 - 5x + 5x - 25)\n10 = x^2 - 25\n\n4. Move all terms to one side of the equation:\n\nx^2 - 25 - 10 = 0\nx^2 - 35 = 0\n\n5. Factor the equation or use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for x:\n\nx^2 - 35 = 0\n(x - √35)(x + √35) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = √35 and x = -√35\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with logarithms, we need to make sure that the solutions are valid (i.e., the arguments of the logarithms are positive).\n\nFor x = √35:\n\nlog(√35 + 5) and log(√35 - 5) are both valid, as the arguments are positive.\n\nFor x = -√35:\n\nlog(-√35 + 5) and log(-√35 - 5) are both invalid, as the arguments are negative.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for x is:\n\nx = √35"
