Initialize x = x0 = 0.1\n2. Initialize the sum of logarithms: sum_log = 0\n3. For n = 1 to N:\n   a. Calculate the derivative: $d = r - 2rx = 3.5 - 2(3.5)x$\n   b. Add the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative to the sum: sum_log += ln(abs(d))\n   c. Update x using the logistic map: $x = rx(1-x)$\n4.
