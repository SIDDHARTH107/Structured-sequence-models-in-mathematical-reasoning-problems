    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nLet's calculate A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements in A x B and B x A are different, even though they have the same number of elements. The ordered pairs in A x B have elements from A as the first element and elements from B as the second element, while in B x A, the elements from B are the first element and elements from A are the second element.\n\nSince A x B â‰  B x A, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
