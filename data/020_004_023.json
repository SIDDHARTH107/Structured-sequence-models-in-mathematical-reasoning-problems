    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize its profit by producing two products, Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 2 units of labor and 3 units of material, while the production of Product B requires 4 units of labor and 2 units of material. The maximum number of units of labor and material available for the company are 100 and 80, respectively. If the profit from each unit of Product A is $5 and from each unit of Product B is $8, how many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and material are:\n2x + 4y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 80 (material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 5x + 8y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Solve each inequality for y:\ny ≤ (100 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ (80 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. Identify the intercepts and graph the lines:\nFor y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 4:\nx-intercept: x = 50, y = 0\ny-intercept: x = 0, y = 25\n\nFor y ≤ (80 - 3x) / 2:\nx-intercept: x = 80/3 ≈ 26.67, y = 0\ny-intercept: x = 0, y = 40\n\n3. Identify the feasible region:\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied, which is the area below both lines and in the first quadrant (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0).\n\n4. Find the vertices of the feasible region:\nThe vertices are the points where the lines intersect the axes and each other:\nA(0, 0), B(0, 25), C(20, 20), and D(50, 0)\n\n5. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\nP(A) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\nP(B) = 5(0) + 8(25) = 200\nP(C) = 5(20) + 8(20) = 260\nP(D) = 5(50) + 8(0) = 250\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, where the company produces 20 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $260."
