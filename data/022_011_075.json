    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the singularity at z = 2i, we first need to analyze the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - 2i)^3. The singularity occurs at z = 2i, where the denominator becomes zero. \n\nSince the denominator has a power of 3, the singularity is of order 3. This means that the singularity is a pole of order 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue of f(z) at z = 2i. To do this, we will use the formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order n:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 2i] = (1/(n-1)!) * (d^(n-1)/dz^(n-1))[(z - 2i)^n * f(z)] at z = 2i\n\nIn our case, n = 3, so the formula becomes:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 2i] = (1/2!) * (d^2/dz^2)[(z - 2i)^3 * f(z)] at z = 2i\n\nFirst, let's multiply f(z) by (z - 2i)^3:\n\ng(z) = (z - 2i)^3 * f(z) = (z^2 - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of g(z) with respect to z:\n\ng'(z) = d/dz(z^2 - 1) = 2z\ng''(z) = d^2/dz^2(z^2 - 1) = 2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the residue:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 2i] = (1/2!) * g''(2i) = (1/2) * 2 = 1\n\nSo, the residue of f(z) at z = 2i is 1."
