    "message_2": "We are given a triangle with angle A = 50°, angle B = 70°, and side a = 6 cm. We are asked to find the length of side c, given that sin C = 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's find angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we have:\n\nC = 180° - A - B\nC = 180° - 50° - 70°\nC = 60°\n\nNow that we have angle C, we can use the sine rule to find the length of side c. The sine rule states that:\n\na / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C\n\nWe want to find c, so we can rearrange the formula to:\n\nc = a * (sin C / sin A)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 6 * (0.9 / sin 50°)\n\nTo find the sine of 50°, we can use a calculator:\n\nsin 50° ≈ 0.766\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nc = 6 * (0.9 / 0.766)\n\nc ≈ 6 * 1.175\n\nc ≈ 7.05\n\nTherefore, the length of side c is approximately 7.05 cm."
