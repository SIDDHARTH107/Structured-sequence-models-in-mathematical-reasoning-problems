    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function over an interval, we can use the formula:\n\naverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) = sin(x), and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\naverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π:\n\n∫[0, π] sin(x) dx = [-cos(x)] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n[-cos(π)] - [-cos(0)] = (-(-1)) - (-(1)) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow, substitute the result back into the average value formula:\n\naverage value = (1/π) * 2 = 2/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = sin(x) over the interval [0, π] is 2/π."
