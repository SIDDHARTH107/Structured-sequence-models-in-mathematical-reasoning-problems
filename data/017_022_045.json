    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nNow, we will find the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor:\n\n1. For the prime factor 2, the Sylow 2-subgroups have order 2^2 = 4. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 60/4 = 15, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15. However, if n_2 = 1, the group would be abelian, so we must have n_2 = 3 or 15.\n\n2. For the prime factor 3, the Sylow 3-subgroups have order 3. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 60/3 = 20, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10. If n_3 = 1, the group would be abelian, so we must have n_3 = 4 or 10.\n\n3. For the prime factor 5, the Sylow 5-subgroups have order 5. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 60/5 = 12, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, the group would be abelian, so we must have n_5 = 6.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then there are 3 * 4 = 12 distinct elements of order 2 and 4 distinct elements of order 3. This leaves 60 - 12 - 4 = 44 elements unaccounted for, which is not divisible by 5. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 10, then there are 3 * 4 = 12 distinct elements of order 2 and 10 * 2 = 20 distinct elements of order 3. This leaves 60 - 12 - 20 = 28 elements unaccounted for, which is not divisible by 5. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\n3. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 4, then there are 15 * 2 = 30 distinct elements of order 2 and 4 distinct elements of order 3. This leaves 60 - 30 - 4 = 26 elements unaccounted for, which is not divisible by 5. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\n4. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 10, then there are 15 * 2 = 30 distinct elements of order 2 and 10 * 2 = 20 distinct elements of order 3. This leaves 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 elements unaccounted for, which is divisible by 5. Thus, this case is possible.\n\nIn the last case, we have n_2 = 15, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 6. Since the Sylow subgroups are not unique, the group is non-abelian. Therefore, there is only 1 non-abelian group of order 60, which is the symmetric group S_5."
