Use the power iteration method to find the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of A, accurate to three decimal places. Repeat the process to find the second largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector.",
    "message_2": "To find the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial vector x_0 = [1; 1].\n2. Compute the matrix-vector product Ax.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's start the iteration process:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_0 = [1; 1]\nAx_0 = [-2 -4; 3 1] * [1; 1] = [-6; 4]\nNormalize: x_1 = [-6/7.211; 4/7.211] ≈ [-0.832; 0.555]\n\nIteration 2:\nAx_1 = [-2 -4; 3 1] * [-0.832; 0.555] ≈ [1.108; -1.663]\nNormalize: x_2 = [1.108/1.999; -1.663/1.999] ≈ [0.554; -0.832]\n\nIteration 3:\nAx_2 = [-2 -4; 3 1] * [0.554; -0.832] ≈ [-0.554; 0.832]\nNormalize: x_3 = [-0.554/1.000; 0.832/1.000] ≈ [-0.554; 0.832]\n\nWe can see that the eigenvector is converging. We can stop here since we have reached the desired accuracy of three decimal places. Now, we can compute the largest eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue_1 = (x_3' * A * x_3) / (x_3' * x_3) ≈ [-0.554 0.832] * [-2 -4; 3 1] * [-0.554; 0.832] / [-0.554 0.832] * [-0.554; 0.832] ≈ 2.000\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue is 2.000, and its corresponding eigenvector is [-0.554; 0.832].\n\nTo find the second-largest eigenvalue, we can use the deflation method. We will modify the matrix A by subtracting the outer product of the first eigenvector and its corresponding eigenvalue:\n\nA_modified = A - Eigenvalue_1 * (x_3 * x_3')\nA_modified ≈ [-2 -4; 3 1] - 2.000 * [-0.554; 0.832] * [-0.554 0.832] ≈ [-0.000 -0.000; 0.000 3.000]\n\nNow, we can apply the power iteration method to the modified matrix A_modified:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_0 = [1; 1]\nA_modified * x_0 = [-0.000 -0.000; 0.000 3.000] * [1; 1] = [0; 3]\nNormalize: x_1 = [0/3; 3/3] = [0; 1]\n\nSince the matrix A_modified is already in its simplest form, we can see that the eigenvector has already converged. Now, we can compute the second-largest eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue_2 = (x_1' * A_modified * x_1) / (x_1' * x_1) = [0 1] * [-0.000 -0.000; 0.000 3.000] * [0; 1] / [0 1] * [0; 1] = 3.000\n\nSo, the second-largest eigenvalue is 3.000, and its corresponding eigenvector is [0; 1]."
