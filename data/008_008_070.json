    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time, while each unit of Product B requires 5 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The company has 400 labor hours and 240 machine hours available. If the profit from each unit of Product A is $50 and the profit from each unit of Product B is $60, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?\n\nFormulate the problem as a linear programming problem using matrix methods and solve it to find the optimal number of units of each product to be produced.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 50x + 60y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor hours: 3x + 5y ≤ 400\n2. Machine hours: 4x + 2y ≤ 240\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints in matrix form as:\n\n| 3  5 | | x | ≤ | 400 |\n| 4  2 | | y | ≤ | 240 |\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region for the given constraints. To do this, we'll find the intercepts and plot the constraint lines.\n\nFor the labor constraint (3x + 5y ≤ 400):\nx-intercept: Set y = 0, then x = 400/3 ≈ 133.33\ny-intercept: Set x = 0, then y = 400/5 = 80\n\nFor the machine constraint (4x + 2y ≤ 240):\nx-intercept: Set y = 0, then x = 240/4 = 60\ny-intercept: Set x = 0, then y = 240/2 = 120\n\nPlot these lines and find the feasible region. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 80), (60, 60), and (133.33, 0). Since this is a linear programming problem, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices.\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P = 50x + 60y at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 0): P = 50(0) + 60(0) = $0\n2. (0, 80): P = 50(0) + 60(80) = $4800\n3. (60, 60): P = 50(60) + 60(60) = $6600\n4. (133.33, 0): P = 50(133.33) + 60(0) ≈ $6666.50\n\nThe maximum profit of $6666.50 occurs when producing 133.33 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B. However, since we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, the company should produce 133 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to achieve a maximum profit of $6650."
