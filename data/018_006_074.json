    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set with 100 elements, and let A be a subset of U with 40 elements. What is the size of the complement of A and what is the size of the union of A and its complement? Show that the union of A and its complement is indeed equal to U.",
    "message_2": "The complement of A, denoted as A', consists of all elements in U that are not in A. Since there are 100 elements in U and 40 elements in A, there are 100 - 40 = 60 elements in A'.\n\nNow, let's consider the union of A and its complement, denoted as A âˆª A'. The union of two sets consists of all elements that are in either of the sets. Since A contains 40 elements and A' contains the remaining 60 elements of U, the union of A and A' contains all 100 elements of U.\n\nTo show that the union of A and its complement is indeed equal to U, we can use the fact that A and A' are disjoint sets, meaning they have no elements in common. This is because A' is defined as the set of all elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, the union of A and A' must contain all elements in U, and no elements outside of U.\n\nIn conclusion, the size of the complement of A is 60, and the size of the union of A and its complement is 100. The union of A and its complement is indeed equal to U, as it contains all elements in U and no elements outside of U."
