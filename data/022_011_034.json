    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n2z^2 - 7z + 6 = 0\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(2z - 3)(z - 2) = 0\n\nSo the zeros of the function are z = 3/2 and z = 2. Both zeros have order 1 since they are simple zeros (not repeated).\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 1 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as well:\n\n(z + 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nSo the pole of the function is z = -1. The order of this pole is 2 since it is a repeated root (a double pole).\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) has zeros at z = 3/2 and z = 2 with order 1, and a pole at z = -1 with order 2."
