    "message_1": "A curve is described by the equation y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4. Find the length of the curve for this interval.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x) over the interval [a, b]:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x^(3/2):\n\nf'(x) = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] sqrt(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] sqrt(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = 1 + (9/4)x, then du/dx = 9/4, and dx = (4/9)du. The new limits of integration will be u(1) = 1 + (9/4)(1) = 13/4 and u(4) = 1 + (9/4)(4) = 10.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[13/4, 10] sqrt(u) * (4/9) du\n\nL = (4/9) ∫[13/4, 10] u^(1/2) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [13/4, 10]\n\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - (13/4)^(3/2))\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * (31.6227766 - 11.1803399)\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * 20.4424367\n\nL ≈ 6.081731\n\nSo, the length of the curve from x = 1 to x = 4 is approximately 6.081731 units."
