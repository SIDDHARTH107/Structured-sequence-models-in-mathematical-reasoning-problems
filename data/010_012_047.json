    "message_2": "To show that f is a smooth function, we need to compute its partial derivatives up to the second order and show that they are continuous. Let's first compute the first-order partial derivatives of f:\n\nf(x, y) = (xy, x^2)\n\n∂f/∂x = (∂(xy)/∂x, ∂(x^2)/∂x) = (y, 2x)\n∂f/∂y = (∂(xy)/∂y, ∂(x^2)/∂y) = (x, 0)\n\nNow let's compute the second-order partial derivatives:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = (∂(y)/∂x, ∂(2x)/∂x) = (0, 2)\n∂²f/∂x∂y = (∂(y)/∂y, ∂(2x)/∂y) = (1, 0)\n∂²f/∂y∂x = (∂(x)/∂x, ∂(0)/∂x) = (1, 0)\n∂²f/∂y² = (∂(x)/∂y, ∂(0)/∂y) = (0, 0)\n\nAll of these second-order partial derivatives are continuous functions on the set S, since they are either constants or linear functions of x and y. Therefore, f is a smooth function on S."
