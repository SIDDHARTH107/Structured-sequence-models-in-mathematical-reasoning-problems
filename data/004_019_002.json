    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the velocity function:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(2t^3 - 5t^2 + 3t + 8)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 6t^2 - 10t + 3$\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at $t=2$ seconds:\n\n$v(2) = 6(2)^2 - 10(2) + 3 = 6(4) - 20 + 3 = 24 - 20 + 3 = 7$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t=2$ seconds is $7$ meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we need to find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the acceleration function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t^2 - 10t + 3)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 12t - 10$\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at $t=2$ seconds:\n\n$a(2) = 12(2) - 10 = 24 - 10 = 14$\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at $t=2$ seconds is $14$ meters per second squared.\n\nIn conclusion, the velocity of the car at $t=2$ seconds is $7$ meters per second, and the acceleration is $14$ meters per second squared."
