    "message_2": "Let's denote the time it takes to solve a problem of input size n as T(n). Since the program's time complexity is O(n log n), we can write T(n) = k * n * log(n) for some constant k. Given that the program takes 10 seconds to solve a problem of input size n, we have:\n\n10 = k * n * log(n)\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes to solve a problem with an input size of 10n, which we can denote as T(10n). Using the time complexity, we have:\n\nT(10n) = k * (10n) * log(10n)\n\nTo find the value of T(10n), we can use the fact that we already know the value of T(n) and the relationship between T(n) and T(10n). We can divide T(10n) by T(n) to get:\n\nT(10n) / T(n) = (k * (10n) * log(10n)) / (k * n * log(n))\n\nThe k and n terms cancel out:\n\nT(10n) / 10 = 10 * log(10n) / log(n)\n\nSince log(a * b) = log(a) + log(b), we can rewrite log(10n) as log(10) + log(n):\n\nT(10n) / 10 = 10 * (log(10) + log(n)) / log(n)\n\nNow, we know that log(10) is equal to 1 (since we are using base 10 logarithm):\n\nT(10n) / 10 = 10 * (1 + log(n)) / log(n)\n\nFinally, we can solve for T(10n):\n\nT(10n) = 100 * (1 + log(n)) / log(n)\n\nSo, the time it takes for the program to solve a problem with an input size of 10n depends on the value of n, and it can be calculated using the formula:\n\nT(10n) = 100 * (1 + log(n)) / log(n) seconds"
