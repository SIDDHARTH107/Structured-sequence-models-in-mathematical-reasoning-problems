    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 7 vertices, so a connected graph would need at least 6 edges.\n\nSince our graph G has 8 edges, which is more than the minimum required, it is possible that the graph is connected. However, we cannot definitively say that the graph is connected without more information about the specific connections between the vertices.\n\nIf the graph is disconnected, we cannot describe each component of the graph without more information about the specific connections between the vertices."
