    "message_1": "In a certain school, there are 300 students who take a mathematics class. Out of these students, 80% have passed the subject by the end of the semester. What is the probability that a random student selected from the school has passed the mathematics class?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a random student selected from the school has passed the mathematics class, we need to find the number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.\n\nNumber of students who passed = 80% of 300\nNumber of students who passed = 0.80 * 300\nNumber of students who passed = 240\n\nTotal number of students = 300\n\nProbability that a random student selected has passed the mathematics class = Number of students who passed / Total number of students\nProbability = 240 / 300\n\nSimplify the fraction:\nProbability = 24 / 30\nProbability = 4 / 5\n\nSo, the probability that a random student selected from the school has passed the mathematics class is 4/5 or 0.8 (80%)."
