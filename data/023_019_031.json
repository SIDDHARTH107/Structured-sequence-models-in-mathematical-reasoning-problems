    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the poles of the transfer function H(s). The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator of H(s) is given by:\n\ns^2 + 6s + 8\n\nTo find the poles, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for s:\n\ns^2 + 6s + 8 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 8. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4*1*8)) / 2*1\ns = (-6 ± √(36 - 32)) / 2\ns = (-6 ± √4) / 2\ns = (-6 ± 2) / 2\n\nThis gives us two possible values for s:\n\ns1 = (-6 + 2) / 2 = -4/2 = -2\ns2 = (-6 - 2) / 2 = -8/2 = -4\n\nThe poles of the transfer function are s1 = -2 and s2 = -4. \n\nNow, we need to check the stability of the system. A system is stable if all the poles have negative real parts. In this case, both poles have negative real parts (-2 and -4), so the system is stable."
