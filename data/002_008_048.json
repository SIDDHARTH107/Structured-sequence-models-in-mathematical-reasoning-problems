    "message_1": "A cone with a height of 10 cm and a radius of 4 cm has a certain volume. What is the volume of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * (4²) * 10\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 16 * 10\n\nVolume = 3.14159 * 53.3333\n\nVolume ≈ 167.5516 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 167.55 cubic centimeters."
