    "message_2": "To compute the Betti number of X, we need to find the dimension of the cohomology groups with real coefficients, i.e., $H^*(X, \\mathbb{R})$. \n\nFor each cohomology group, we can compute the dimension by considering the torsion-free part, since torsion subgroups do not contribute to the dimension over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1. $H^0(X) = \\mathbb{Z}$: The torsion-free part is $\\mathbb{Z}$, which has dimension 1 over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2. $H^1(X) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$: The torsion-free part is $\\mathbb{Z}$, which has dimension 1 over $\\mathbb{R}$. The $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ part is torsion and does not contribute to the dimension.\n\n3. $H^2(X) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: This group is entirely torsion, so it does not contribute to the dimension over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nAdding up the dimensions of the torsion-free parts, we get the Betti number of X:\n\nBetti number = 1 (from $H^0(X)$) + 1 (from $H^1(X)$) + 0 (from $H^2(X)$) = 2.\n\nSo, the Betti number of X is 2."
