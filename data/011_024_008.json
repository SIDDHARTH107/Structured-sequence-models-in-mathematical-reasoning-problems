Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider a network with four nodes and five arcs, where the capacity of each arc is shown in the following table:\n\n| Arc | Capacity |\n| --- | -------- |\n| 1-2 | 5        |\n| 1-3 | 3        |\n| 2-3 | 2        |\n| 2-4 | 4        |\n| 3-4 | 6        |\n\nFind the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from node 1 to node 4.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node 1 to node 4, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will start with an initial flow of 0 and iteratively find augmenting paths to increase the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initial flow: 0\n\n2. Find an augmenting path:\n   Path: 1-2-4\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(5, 4) = 4\n   Update flow: 0 + 4 = 4\n\n3. Find another augmenting path:\n   Path: 1-3-4\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(3, 6) = 3\n   Update flow: 4 + 3 = 7\n\n4. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow from node 1 to node 4 is 7."
