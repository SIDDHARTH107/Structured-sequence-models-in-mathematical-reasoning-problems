    "message_2": "To find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 54 and 72, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (72) by the smaller number (54) and find the remainder.\n   72 รท 54 = 1, remainder 18\n\n2. Replace the larger number (72) with the smaller number (54) and the smaller number with the remainder (18).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 54 and 18.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (54) by the smaller number (18) and find the remainder.\n   54 รท 18 = 3, remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 18. So, the GCD of 54 and 72 is 18."
