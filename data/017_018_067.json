    "message_2": "There are 51 groups of order 32 up to isomorphism. Among them, 46 are non-abelian.\n\nTo find the possible isomorphism classes of all groups of order 32, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. A group of order 32 is a p-group, where p is a prime number (in this case, p = 2).\n3. The number of groups of order p^n is finite and depends on the number of partitions of n.\n\nNow, let's find the isomorphism classes of groups of order 32:\n\n1. There is one abelian group of order 32, which is the cyclic group Z_32.\n2. There are four abelian groups of order 16, which are Z_16, Z_8 x Z_2, Z_4 x Z_4, and Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2. Each of these can be extended to a group of order 32 in a non-abelian way, giving us 4 non-abelian groups.\n3. There are two abelian groups of order 8, which are Z_8 and Z_4 x Z_2. Each of these can be extended to a group of order 32 in a non-abelian way, giving us 2 non-abelian groups.\n4. There is one abelian group of order 4, which is Z_4. It can be extended to a group of order 32 in a non-abelian way, giving us 1 non-abelian group.\n\nIn total, we have 1 abelian group and 46 non-abelian groups, making a total of 51 groups of order 32 up to isomorphism."
