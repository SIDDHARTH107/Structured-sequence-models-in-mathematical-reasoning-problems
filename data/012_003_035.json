    "message_2": "To find the size of the maximum independent set in the graph G, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of the maximum independent set (α(G)) and the minimum vertex cover (β(G)) is equal to the number of vertices in the graph (n).\n\nn = α(G) + β(G)\n\nSince G has 7 vertices and 11 edges, we can use the inequality that states that the number of edges (m) is less than or equal to the product of the minimum vertex cover and the number of vertices minus the minimum vertex cover, divided by 2:\n\nm ≤ β(G) * (n - β(G)) / 2\n\nPlugging in the values for G:\n\n11 ≤ β(G) * (7 - β(G)) / 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n22 ≤ β(G) * (7 - β(G))\n\nNow we need to find the smallest possible value for β(G) that satisfies this inequality. We can test values starting from 1:\n\nFor β(G) = 1:\n\n22 ≤ 1 * (7 - 1) = 6 (False)\n\nFor β(G) = 2:\n\n22 ≤ 2 * (7 - 2) = 10 (False)\n\nFor β(G) = 3:\n\n22 ≤ 3 * (7 - 3) = 12 (True)\n\nSo the smallest possible value for β(G) is 3. Now we can use the equation n = α(G) + β(G) to find the size of the maximum independent set:\n\n7 = α(G) + 3\n\nα(G) = 4\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in the graph G is 4."
