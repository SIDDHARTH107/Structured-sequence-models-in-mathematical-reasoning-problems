    "message_2": "The phase shift of a trigonometric function is the horizontal shift applied to the function. For a cosine function in the form y = A cos(Bx - C), the phase shift can be found by solving the equation Bx - C = 0 for x.\n\nIn the given function y = 2 cos(3x - π/4), we have B = 3 and C = π/4. To find the phase shift, we need to solve the equation:\n\n3x - π/4 = 0\n\nNow, isolate x:\n\n3x = π/4\nx = (π/4) / 3\nx = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function y = 2 cos(3x - π/4) is π/12."
