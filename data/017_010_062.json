    "message_2": "We will analyze each of the given groups and compare their properties with the given group G.\n\n1. Cyclic group C10:\nA cyclic group of order 10 has a generator element of order 10. However, in the given group G, every element except the identity element has order 2. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\n2. Dihedral group D5:\nThe dihedral group D5 has order 10, but it has elements of order 2 and 5. In the given group G, every element except the identity element has order 2. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10:\nSince every element of G except the identity element has order 2, G must be an abelian group. This is because for any two elements a and b in G, we have (ab)^2 = abab = aabb = ee = e, where e is the identity element. Thus, ab = ba, which means G is abelian. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nSince G is not isomorphic to any of the given groups (C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10), we conclude that G must be a different group. One such group that satisfies the given conditions is the Klein four-group V extended by a cyclic group of order 2, which is an abelian group of order 10 where every element except the identity element has order 2."
