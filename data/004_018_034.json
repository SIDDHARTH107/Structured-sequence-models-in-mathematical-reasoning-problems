The power rule states that if y = x^n, then the derivative dy/dx = n*x^(n-1).\n\n1. For the term 3x^5:\n   Using the power rule, the derivative is (5)*(3x^(5-1)) = 15x^4.\n\n2. For the term -2x^3:\n   Using the power rule, the derivative is (3)*(-2x^(3-1)) = -6x^2.\n\n3. For the term 7x:\n   Using the power rule, the derivative is (1)*(7x^(1-1)) = 7.\n\n4. For the constant term -4:\n   The derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the overall derivative:\n\ndy/dx = 15x^4 - 6x^2 + 7"
