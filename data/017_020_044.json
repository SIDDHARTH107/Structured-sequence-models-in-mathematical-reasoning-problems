    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 40, we first note that 40 = 2^3 * 5. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of these groups.\n\n1. Sylow 5-subgroups: By Sylow's first theorem, there must be at least one subgroup of order 5 (since 5 is a prime divisor of 40). By Sylow's third theorem, the number of such subgroups must divide 2^3 = 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\n2. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's first theorem, there must be at least one subgroup of order 8 (since 2^3 is the highest power of 2 dividing 40). By Sylow's third theorem, the number of such subgroups must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 8. The only possibilities are 1 and 5. If there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the non-abelian groups of order 40:\n\n1. If both the Sylow 5-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroup are normal, the group is a direct product of these subgroups. Since there are two non-abelian groups of order 8 (the dihedral group D_4 and the quaternion group Q_8), there are two possibilities: C_5 × D_4 and C_5 × Q_8.\n\n2. If there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, we can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups. Let P be the Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since Aut(P) ≅ C_4, there are two non-trivial homomorphisms from Q to Aut(P) when Q ≅ D_4, and one non-trivial homomorphism when Q ≅ Q_8. This gives us a total of 3 non-abelian semidirect products when Q ≅ D_4 and 1 non-abelian semidirect product when Q ≅ Q_8.\n\nIn total, we have found 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 non-abelian groups of order 40. These are:\n\n1. C_5 × D_4\n2. C_5 × Q_8\n3-5. Three non-abelian semidirect products with Q ≅ D_4\n6. One non-abelian semidirect product with Q ≅ Q_8\n\nIf a group of order 40 is not cyclic or dihedral, it cannot be isomorphic to the direct product C_5 × D_4, as this group is dihedral. Therefore, it must be isomorphic to one of the other five non-abelian groups listed above."
