    "message_2": "1. First-order partial derivatives:\n\nTo find the first-order partial derivatives, we will differentiate the function z = x^2 + y^2 with respect to x and y.\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\n2. Second-order partial derivatives:\n\nNow, we will find the second-order partial derivatives by differentiating the first-order partial derivatives with respect to x and y.\n\n∂²z/∂x² = ∂(2x)/∂x = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = ∂(2y)/∂y = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = ∂(2x)/∂y = 0\n∂²z/∂y∂x = ∂(2y)/∂x = 0\n\n3. Gaussian curvature:\n\nThe Gaussian curvature (K) of a surface can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nK = (L*M - N^2) / (E*G - F^2)\n\nwhere E = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2, F = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y), G = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2, L = ∂²z/∂x², M = ∂²z/∂y², and N = ∂²z/∂x∂y.\n\nAt the point (0,0), the first-order partial derivatives are:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2(0) = 0\n∂z/∂y = 2(0) = 0\n\nNow, we can calculate E, F, G, L, M, and N:\n\nE = 1 + (0)^2 = 1\nF = (0)(0) = 0\nG = 1 + (0)^2 = 1\nL = 2\nM = 2\nN = 0\n\nFinally, we can calculate the Gaussian curvature:\n\nK = (L*M - N^2) / (E*G - F^2) = (2*2 - 0^2) / (1*1 - 0^2) = 4 / 1 = 4\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (0,0) is 4."
