    "message_2": "To calculate the Lie derivative Lie_V(f) of the function f(x,y) = 4x^2 - 3y, we need to apply the vector field V to the function f. The Lie derivative is given by:\n\nLie_V(f) = V(f) = x^3 ∂f/∂x + e^y ∂f/∂y\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y:\n\n∂f/∂x = 8x\n∂f/∂y = -3\n\nNow, we can substitute these partial derivatives into the Lie derivative formula:\n\nLie_V(f) = x^3 (8x) + e^y (-3)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the Lie derivative at the point (1,0):\n\nLie_V(f) = (1)^3 (8(1)) + e^(0) (-3)\nLie_V(f) = 8 - 3\nLie_V(f) = 5\n\nSo, the Lie derivative Lie_V(f) of the function f(x,y) = 4x^2 - 3y at the point (1,0) is 5."
