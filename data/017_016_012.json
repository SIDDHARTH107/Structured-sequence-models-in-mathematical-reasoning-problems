    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 27, we know that |G| = 27 = 3^3. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, if G is abelian, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C_27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C_9 × C_3 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 3)\n3. C_3 × C_3 × C_3 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements of order 3 in each of these groups:\n\n1. In C_27, there are φ(3) = 2 elements of order 3, where φ is the Euler's totient function.\n2. In C_9 × C_3, there are (9-1)(3-1) = 16 elements of order 3.\n3. In C_3 × C_3 × C_3, there are (3^3 - 1) - (3^2 - 1) - (3 - 1) = 26 - 8 - 2 = 16 elements of order 3.\n\nNow, let's use the following fact: In a finite abelian group G, the number of elements of order m is a multiple of φ(m) for every positive integer m dividing |G|.\n\nIn our case, since |G| = 27, we have m = 3, and φ(3) = 2. Therefore, the number of elements of order 3 in G must be a multiple of 2.\n\nWe can see that only C_27 satisfies this condition, as it has 2 elements of order 3. Thus, if G is abelian, it must be isomorphic to C_27.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is not abelian. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to any of the abelian groups listed above. However, there is a unique non-abelian group of order 27, which is a semidirect product of C_9 and C_3. This group has a presentation:\n\nG = ⟨a, b | a^9 = b^3 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^4⟩\n\nSince G is not abelian, it must be isomorphic to this non-abelian group of order 27."
