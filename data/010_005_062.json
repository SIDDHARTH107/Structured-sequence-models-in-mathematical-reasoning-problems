    "message_2": "To prove that if there exists a path from x to y and a path from y to z, then there exists a path from x to z, we can use the following approach:\n\nLet p: [0, 1] → X be a continuous function such that p(0) = x and p(1) = y. This is the path from x to y.\nLet q: [0, 1] → X be a continuous function such that q(0) = y and q(1) = z. This is the path from y to z.\n\nNow, we can define a new continuous function r: [0, 1] → X as follows:\n\nr(t) = { p(2t) if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2\n         q(2t - 1) if 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1 }\n\nThis function r is continuous because p and q are continuous, and r(t) = p(2t) for t = 1/2, which means that r is well-defined and continuous at t = 1/2. Moreover, r(0) = p(0) = x and r(1) = q(1) = z. Thus, r is a continuous path from x to z, proving the statement.\n\nNow, let's find an example of a topological space X that is connected but not path-connected.\n\nConsider the topological space X called the \"topologist's sine curve\", which is defined as the following subset of the plane ℝ²:\n\nX = { (x, sin(1/x)) | 0 < x ≤ 1 } ∪ { (0, y) | -1 ≤ y ≤ 1 }\n\nThis space is connected because it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. However, it is not path-connected. To see this, suppose there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = (0, 0) and f(1) = (1, sin(1)). Since f is continuous, the preimage of the vertical line segment { (0, y) | -1 ≤ y ≤ 1 } under f is a closed set in [0, 1]. Let t be the supremum of this closed set. Then, f(t) = (0, y) for some y in [-1, 1]. However, any neighborhood of (0, y) in X contains points of the form (x, sin(1/x)) with x > 0, and by continuity of f, there must be points in the preimage of this neighborhood with parameter values greater than t, which contradicts the definition of t as the supremum. Therefore, no such continuous function f exists, and X is not path-connected."
