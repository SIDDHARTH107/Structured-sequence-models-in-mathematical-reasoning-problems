    "message_2": "To find the result of multiplying the base point $(2, 22)$ by the scalar $k = 23$, we will use the double-and-add algorithm for elliptic curve point multiplication. The algorithm involves repeated point doubling and point addition operations.\n\nFirst, let's define the point addition and point doubling operations for elliptic curves over a finite field:\n\n1. Point addition: Given two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on the elliptic curve, the sum $R = P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is calculated as follows:\n\n   $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\pmod{p}$\n\n   $y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{p}$\n\n   where $\\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\pmod{p}$ and $p = 67$ in our case.\n\n2. Point doubling: Given a point $P = (x_1, y_1)$ on the elliptic curve, the doubled point $R = 2P = (x_3, y_3)$ is calculated as follows:\n\n   $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - 2x_1 \\pmod{p}$\n\n   $y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{p}$\n\n   where $\\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} \\pmod{p}$, $a = 5$, and $p = 67$.\n\nNow, let's perform the double-and-add algorithm for $k = 23$:\n\n1. Write $k$ in binary form: $23 = 10111_2$.\n\n2. Initialize the result point $R = (0, 0)$ (the point at infinity).\n\n3. Iterate through the binary representation of $k$ from left to right:\n\n   - For each bit, perform point doubling on $R$.\n   - If the bit is 1, perform point addition between $R$ and the base point.\n\n4. The final value of $R$ is the result of the point multiplication.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\n1. $k = 23 = 10111_2$.\n\n2. $R = (0, 0)$.\n\n3. Iterate through the binary representation of $k$:\n\n   - First bit (1): $R = 2R + (2, 22) = (2, 22)$.\n   - Second bit (0): $R = 2R = (52, 7)$.\n   - Third bit (1): $R = 2R + (2, 22) = (25, 39)$.\n   - Fourth bit (1): $R = 2R + (2, 22) = (64, 22)$.\n   - Fifth bit (1): $R = 2R + (2, 22) = (47, 64)$.\n\n4. The final value of $R = (47, 64)$.\n\nTherefore, the result of multiplying the base point $(2, 22)$ by the scalar $k = 23$ is $(47, 64)$."
