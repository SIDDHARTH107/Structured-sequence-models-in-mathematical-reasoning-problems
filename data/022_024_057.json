    "message_1": "A heated rod is modeled as the line segment $L$ from $z=0$ to $z=1+i$ in the complex plane. The ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature of $0$ degrees and $100$ degrees, respectively. The temperature $u(z,t)$ at position $z$ and time $t$ is given by the solution to the heat equation: \n\n$$u_t(z,t) = u_{zz}(z,t)$$\n\nwith the initial condition:\n\n$$ u(z,0)=0, \\ \\ \\ 0 \\leq Re(z) \\leq 1, \\ \\ \\ 0 \\leq Im(z) \\leq 1, $$\n\nand the boundary conditions:\n\n$$ u(0,t)=0, \\ \\ \\ u(1+i,t)=100, \\ \\ \\ 0 \\leq t \\leq T, $$\n\nwhere $T$ is the final time of the simulation.\n\nIf the temperature at point $z=0.5i$ is $25$ degrees at time $t=1$, what is the temperature at point $z=0.5+0.5i$ at time $t=1$?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(z,t) = X(z)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(z)T'(t) = X''(z)T(t)$$\n\nDividing both sides by $XT$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(z)}{X(z)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a separation constant. Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $T'(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$\n\n2) $X''(z) + \\lambda X(z) = 0$\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$$T(t) = C_1 e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant.\n\nFor the second equation, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: $\\lambda > 0$\n\nIn this case, the general solution is:\n\n$$X(z) = C_2 \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}z) + C_3 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}z)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $X(0) = 0$ and $X(1+i) = 100$, we get:\n\n$$C_2 = 0$$\n\n$$100 = C_3 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}(1+i))$$\n\nSince $C_3 \\neq 0$, we have:\n\n$$\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}(1+i)) = \\frac{100}{C_3}$$\n\nCase 2: $\\lambda < 0$\n\nIn this case, the general solution is:\n\n$$X(z) = C_4 e^{\\sqrt{-\\lambda}z} + C_5 e^{-\\sqrt{-\\lambda}z}$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $X(0) = 0$ and $X(1+i) = 100$, we get:\n\n$$C_4 + C_5 = 0$$\n\n$$100 = C_4 e^{\\sqrt{-\\lambda}(1+i)} - C_4 e^{-\\sqrt{-\\lambda}(1+i)}$$\n\nSince $C_4 \\neq 0$, we have:\n\n$$e^{\\sqrt{-\\lambda}(1+i)} - e^{-\\sqrt{-\\lambda}(1+i)} = \\frac{100}{C_4}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the appropriate values of $\\lambda$ and the constants $C_i$ that satisfy the given condition $u(0.5i,1) = 25$. This is a difficult task and requires numerical methods to solve. However, we can make an approximation based on the given information.\n\nSince the temperature at $z=0.5i$ is $25$ degrees at time $t=1$, we can assume that the temperature distribution is roughly linear along the imaginary axis. Therefore, we can estimate the temperature at $z=0.5+0.5i$ by taking the average of the temperatures at $z=0$ and $z=1+i$, which are $0$ and $100$ degrees, respectively:\n\n$$u(0.5+0.5i,1) \\approx \\frac{0 + 100}{2} = 50$$\n\nSo, the temperature at point $z=0.5+0.5i$ at time $t=1$ is approximately $50$ degrees."
