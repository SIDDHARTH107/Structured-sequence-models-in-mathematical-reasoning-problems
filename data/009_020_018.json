    "message_2": "The optimal control approach is not applicable to this problem, as it is a method used to find the best possible control for a given system, typically in the context of dynamic systems. Instead, we will solve this first-order differential equation using separation of variables.\n\nGiven the differential equation:\n\ndy/dx = x/y\n\nWe can separate the variables by multiplying both sides by y and dividing by x:\n\ny dy = x dx\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫y dy = ∫x dx\n\n(1/2)y^2 = (1/2)x^2 + C\n\nNow, we will use the initial condition y(1) = 2 to find the constant C:\n\n(1/2)(2)^2 = (1/2)(1)^2 + C\n\n2 = 1/2 + C\n\nC = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\n(1/2)y^2 = (1/2)x^2 + 3/2\n\nNow, we will find the value of y when x = 3:\n\n(1/2)y^2 = (1/2)(3)^2 + 3/2\n\n(1/2)y^2 = 9/2 + 3/2\n\n(1/2)y^2 = 12/2\n\ny^2 = 12\n\ny = ±√12\n\nSince the initial condition y(1) = 2 is positive, we will take the positive root:\n\ny = √12\n\nSo, the value of y when x = 3 is y = √12."
