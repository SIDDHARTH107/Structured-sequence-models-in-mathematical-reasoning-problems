    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph G is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in G. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the given adjacency matrix to find the largest complete subgraph:\n\n1. The first three vertices (1, 2, 3) form a complete subgraph, as they are all connected to each other:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n2. The last three vertices (4, 5, 6) also form a complete subgraph, as they are all connected to each other:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n3. There is no larger complete subgraph in the given graph G, as no set of 4 or more vertices are all connected to each other.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of G is 3, as the largest complete subgraphs have 3 vertices."
