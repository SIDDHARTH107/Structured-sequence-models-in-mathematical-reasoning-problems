    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid is a fractal structure made up of equilateral triangles. In this case, there are 64 small equilateral triangles, each with a side length of 1 cm.\n\nTo find the total surface area of the Sierpinski pyramid, we first need to find the area of one small equilateral triangle. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length of 1 cm, we get:\n\nArea = (1² * √3) / 4 = (√3) / 4 cm²\n\nNow, we need to find the total surface area of the Sierpinski pyramid by multiplying the area of one small triangle by the total number of triangles:\n\nTotal Surface Area = (Number of Triangles) * (Area of One Triangle)\nTotal Surface Area = 64 * (√3 / 4) cm²\nTotal Surface Area = 16√3 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the Sierpinski pyramid is 16√3 cm²."
