    "message_1": "What is the probability that a burglary will occur in a particular neighborhood in the next month, given that on average, there are usually 2 burglaries every 3 months in that neighborhood?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, burglaries) in a fixed interval of time (in this case, a month).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average number of events in the given time interval\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of burglaries per month (λ). Since there are 2 burglaries every 3 months, the average number of burglaries per month is:\n\nλ = (2 burglaries) / (3 months) = 2/3 ≈ 0.67 burglaries per month\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that at least one burglary will occur in the next month. To do this, we can find the probability that no burglaries will occur and then subtract that from 1.\n\nUsing the Poisson formula with k = 0 (no burglaries):\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.67) * 0.67^0) / 0! = (e^(-0.67) * 1) / 1 = e^(-0.67) ≈ 0.512\n\nNow, we find the probability of at least one burglary:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.512 ≈ 0.488\n\nSo, the probability that a burglary will occur in the next month in this neighborhood is approximately 0.488 or 48.8%."
