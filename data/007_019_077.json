    "message_2": "To determine if 1039 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. \n\nWe can start by checking if 1039 is divisible by the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103.\n\n1039 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.\n\n1039 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 3 + 9 = 13) is not divisible by 3.\n\n1039 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.\n\n1039 is not divisible by 7 because 1039 - (2 * 9) = 1021, which is not divisible by 7.\n\n1039 is not divisible by any of the other prime numbers listed above, as the result of dividing 1039 by any of these numbers is not a whole number.\n\nSince 1039 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (approximately 32.2), we can conclude that 1039 is a prime number."
