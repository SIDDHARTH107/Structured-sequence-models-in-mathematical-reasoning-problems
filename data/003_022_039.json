    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nv · w = ||v|| ||w|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere ||v|| and ||w|| are the magnitudes of the vectors v and w, respectively, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnitudes of the vectors v and w:\n\n||v|| = √(2^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n||w|| = √((-3)^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (v · w) / (||v|| ||w||)\n\nTo find v · w, we can use the standard formula for the dot product:\n\nv · w = (2 * -3) + (5 * 4) = -6 + 20 = 14\n\nNow we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (14) / (√29 * 5)\n\nFinally, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nv · w = ||v|| ||w|| cos(θ) = (√29 * 5) * (14 / (√29 * 5))\n\nThe terms √29 and 5 cancel out, leaving:\n\nv · w = 14\n\nSo, the dot product of the vectors v and w is 14."
