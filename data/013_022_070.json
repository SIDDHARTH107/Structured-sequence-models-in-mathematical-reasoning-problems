    "message_2": "Player 1 decides to keep 75% of the $50. To find out how much money Player 1 keeps, we can calculate:\n\n50 * 0.75 = 37.5\n\nPlayer 1 keeps $37.50 for themselves. To find out how much money Player 2 receives, we can subtract the amount Player 1 keeps from the total amount:\n\n50 - 37.5 = 12.5\n\nPlayer 2 receives $12.50."
