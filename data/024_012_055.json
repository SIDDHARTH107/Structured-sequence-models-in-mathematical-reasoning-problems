    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator of the given differential form ω, we first need to define an inner product and a volume form on the manifold M. Let's assume the manifold M is equipped with the standard Euclidean metric, which has the inner product:\n\n⟨(a₁, a₂, a₃), (b₁, b₂, b₃)⟩ = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + a₃b₃\n\nand the volume form:\n\nvol = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, let's compute the Hodge star operator of ω at the point (1,2,3) ∈ M. The Hodge star operator is defined as:\n\n*ω = α, where α is the unique (3-2)-form such that ω ∧ α = ⟨ω, ω⟩ vol\n\nIn this case, we have a 2-form ω, so we are looking for a 1-form α. Let α = A dx + B dy + C dz for some functions A, B, and C. Then, we have:\n\nω ∧ α = (x dy ∧ dz + y dx ∧ dz + z dx ∧ dy) ∧ (A dx + B dy + C dz)\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\nω ∧ α = (xA dy ∧ dz ∧ dx + yA dx ∧ dz ∧ dx + zA dx ∧ dy ∧ dx) + (xB dy ∧ dz ∧ dy + yB dx ∧ dz ∧ dy + zB dx ∧ dy ∧ dy) + (xC dy ∧ dz ∧ dz + yC dx ∧ dz ∧ dz + zC dx ∧ dy ∧ dz)\n\nUsing the antisymmetry property of the wedge product, we can simplify this expression:\n\nω ∧ α = (zA - xC) dy ∧ dz ∧ dx + (-zB + yC) dx ∧ dz ∧ dy + (yB - xA) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, we need to compute the inner product ⟨ω, ω⟩:\n\n⟨ω, ω⟩ = ⟨x dy ∧ dz + y dx ∧ dz + z dx ∧ dy, x dy ∧ dz + y dx ∧ dz + z dx ∧ dy⟩\n\nSince the wedge product is alternating, the inner product of a form with itself is zero if the form is not a multiple of the volume form. Therefore, we have:\n\n⟨ω, ω⟩ = x² + y² + z²\n\nAt the point (1,2,3), this inner product is:\n\n⟨ω, ω⟩(1,2,3) = 1² + 2² + 3² = 14\n\nNow, we need to find α such that:\n\nω ∧ α = 14 vol = 14 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nComparing the coefficients of dy ∧ dz ∧ dx, dx ∧ dz ∧ dy, and dx ∧ dy ∧ dz in ω ∧ α and 14 vol, we get the following system of equations:\n\nzA - xC = 0\n-zB + yC = 0\nyB - xA = 14\n\nAt the point (1,2,3), this system becomes:\n\n3A - C = 0\n-2B + 3C = 0\n2B - A = 14\n\nSolving this system, we find A = 4, B = 3, and C = 1. Therefore, the Hodge star operator of ω at the point (1,2,3) is:\n\n*ω(1,2,3) = 4 dx + 3 dy + dz"
