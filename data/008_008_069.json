    "message_1": "Suppose you are running a company that produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of finishing time, while each unit of Product B requires 1 hour of assembly time and 3 hours of finishing time. The company has 30 hours of assembly time and 21 hours of finishing time available each day. The profit for each unit of Product A is $20 and for each unit of Product B is $30. Determine the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce each day in order to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We have the following constraints due to the available assembly and finishing times:\n\n2x + y ≤ 30 (assembly time constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 21 (finishing time constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\ny ≤ -2x + 30\ny ≤ -(1/3)x + 7\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 7), (9, 4), and (15, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\nP(0, 7) = 20(0) + 30(7) = $210\nP(9, 4) = 20(9) + 30(4) = $180 + $120 = $300\nP(15, 0) = 20(15) + 30(0) = $300\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 9 units of Product A and 4 units of Product B, with a total profit of $300 per day."
