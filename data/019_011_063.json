    "message_2": "First, let's break down the given statements:\n\np: \"3 is an odd number\" - This statement is true, as 3 is indeed an odd number.\n\nq: \"4 is an even number\" - This statement is also true, as 4 is indeed an even number.\n\nNow, let's consider the relevance logic proposition:\n\n\"If p → q and p are both true, then q is also true\"\n\nSince p is true and q is true, we can say that the implication p → q is also true. This is because if p is true and q is true, then the statement \"if p, then q\" holds true.\n\nSo, we have both p → q and p being true. According to the proposition, this means that q must also be true. And as we've already established, q is indeed true.\n\nTherefore, the proposition is true."
