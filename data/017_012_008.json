    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16, we will consider the structure of G based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nStep 1: Sylow theorems\nSince the order of G is 16, which is a power of a prime (2^4), we can apply the Sylow theorems. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n1. n_2 divides the order of G, so n_2 divides 16.\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that n_2 can be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. However, since n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2, the only possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 8.\n\nStep 2: Case n_2 = 1\nIf n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let P be this Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the order of P is 16, P is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16 (also known as the quaternion group Q16). \n\nIf P is isomorphic to C16, then G is isomorphic to C16, as G has only one Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to any of the other groups, then G is isomorphic to one of the non-cyclic groups: D8 or the non-abelian group of order 16 (Q16).\n\nStep 3: Case n_2 = 8\nIf n_2 = 8, then there are 8 Sylow 2-subgroups in G. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to C16, as a cyclic group of order 16 has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. \n\nWe will show that G is isomorphic to D8. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 16, P is isomorphic to one of the groups mentioned in Step 2. However, P cannot be isomorphic to C16, as G has 8 Sylow 2-subgroups. Therefore, P must be isomorphic to one of the non-cyclic groups: D8 or the non-abelian group of order 16 (Q16).\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of its Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_8. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups, which must be a normal subgroup of G. Since G is non-abelian, this kernel cannot be trivial. Moreover, the kernel cannot be the whole group G, as G has 8 Sylow 2-subgroups. Thus, the kernel must have order 2 or 4.\n\nIf the kernel has order 2, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_8 of order 8, which is the dihedral group D8.\n\nIf the kernel has order 4, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_8 of order 4. However, this is not possible, as the only group of order 4 in S_8 is the Klein four-group, which is abelian, contradicting the non-abelian nature of G.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to D8.\n\nConclusion:\nWe have shown that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16 (Q16)."
