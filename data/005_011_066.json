    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs wants to test the life span of their new product. They randomly select 50 bulbs and test them until they burn out. The resulting data has a mean lifespan of 1200 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. What is the probability that a bulb selected at random from this population will have a lifespan of more than 1300 hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a bulb selected at random from this population will have a lifespan of more than 1300 hours, we can use the z-score formula and standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (1300 hours), μ is the mean (1200 hours), and σ is the standard deviation (100 hours).\n\nz = (1300 - 1200) / 100\nz = 100 / 100\nz = 1\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability. The z-table gives us the probability that a value falls to the left of the z-score. Since we want the probability that a bulb has a lifespan of more than 1300 hours, we need to find the probability to the right of the z-score.\n\nThe probability to the left of z = 1 is 0.8413. To find the probability to the right, we subtract this value from 1:\n\nP(X > 1300) = 1 - 0.8413\nP(X > 1300) = 0.1587\n\nSo, the probability that a bulb selected at random from this population will have a lifespan of more than 1300 hours is approximately 15.87%."
