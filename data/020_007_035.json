    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the math student to solve:\n\nA company produces three different products, and they have 5 employees who can work on any of the three products. Each employee can only work on one product at a time. The time (in hours) required to produce each product by each employee is as follows:\n\n|         | Product A | Product B | Product C |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Employee 1 |    5      |      3    |      2    |\n| Employee 2 |    1      |      4    |      6    |\n| Employee 3 |    8      |      2    |      3    |\n| Employee 4 |    2      |      1    |      4    |\n| Employee 5 |    4      |      6    |      1    |\n\nThe company wants to meet the following production goals each week:\n\n- At least 200 units of Product A.\n- At least 150 units of Product B.\n- At least 100 units of Product C.\n\nHow many employees should be assigned to each product in order to minimize the total time required to meet these production goals? What is the minimum total time?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total time required to meet the production goals, we should assign each employee to the product they can produce the fastest. We will then calculate the total production per hour for each product and determine how many hours are needed to meet the production goals.\n\nAssignments:\n- Employee 1: Product C (2 hours per unit)\n- Employee 2: Product A (1 hour per unit)\n- Employee 3: Product B (2 hours per unit)\n- Employee 4: Product B (1 hour per unit)\n- Employee 5: Product C (1 hour per unit)\n\nTotal production per hour:\n- Product A: 1 unit (Employee 2)\n- Product B: 1.5 units (Employee 3 and Employee 4)\n- Product C: 1.5 units (Employee 1 and Employee 5)\n\nHours needed to meet production goals:\n- Product A: 200 units / 1 unit per hour = 200 hours\n- Product B: 150 units / 1.5 units per hour = 100 hours\n- Product C: 100 units / 1.5 units per hour = 66.67 hours (rounded up to 67 hours)\n\nMinimum total time: 200 hours (Product A) + 100 hours (Product B) + 67 hours (Product C) = 367 hours\n\nSo, to minimize the total time required to meet the production goals, 1 employee should be assigned to Product A, 2 employees to Product B, and 2 employees to Product C. The minimum total time required is 367 hours."
