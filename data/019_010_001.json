    "message_2": "To solve this linear system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate $z$ from the first two equations. To do this, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n$(2x + 3y + z) - (x + y + z) = 10 - 5$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x + 2y = 5$ (1)\n\nNow, let's eliminate $z$ from the second and third equations. To do this, we can subtract twice the first equation from the third equation:\n\n$(3x + 2y + 2z) - 2(x + y + z) = 8 - 2(5)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x - 2y = -2$ (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, $x$ and $y$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + 2y &= 5 \\\\\nx - 2y &= -2\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve this system by adding the two equations:\n\n$(x + 2y) + (x - 2y) = 5 + (-2)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$2x = 3$\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\n$x = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nNow that we have the value of $x$, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of $y$. Let's use equation (1):\n\n$\\frac{3}{2} + 2y = 5$\n\nSubtract $\\frac{3}{2}$ from both sides:\n\n$2y = \\frac{7}{2}$\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\n$y = \\frac{7}{4}$\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ back into any of the original equations to find the value of $z$. Let's use the first equation:\n\n$\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{7}{4} + z = 5$\n\nTo solve for $z$, first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n$\\frac{6}{4} + \\frac{7}{4} + z = 5$\n\nNow, add the fractions:\n\n$\\frac{13}{4} + z = 5$\n\nSubtract $\\frac{13}{4}$ from both sides:\n\n$z = 5 - \\frac{13}{4}$\n\nNow, find a common denominator:\n\n$z = \\frac{20}{4} - \\frac{13}{4}$\n\nSubtract the fractions:\n\n$z = \\frac{7}{4}$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\n$x = \\frac{3}{2}, y = \\frac{7}{4}, z = \\frac{7}{4}$"
