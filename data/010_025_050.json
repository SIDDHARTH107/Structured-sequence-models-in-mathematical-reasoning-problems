    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a closed surface can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a closed surface of genus g, the Euler characteristic can also be expressed as:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nIn this case, the genus (g) is 2, so we can calculate the Euler characteristic as follows:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of a closed surface of genus 2 is -2."
