A sample of 25 cups was randomly selected and the mean amount of coffee per cup was found to be 11.8 ounces. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of coffee per cup for this company?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of coffee per cup, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence interval = x̄ ± (z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95%), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 11.8 ounces, σ = 0.5 ounces, and n = 25.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 0.5 / √25 = 0.5 / 5 = 0.1\n\nNext, we'll find the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = z * SE = 1.96 * 0.1 = 0.196\n\nFinally, we'll calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence interval = x̄ ± ME = 11.8 ± 0.196\n\nLower limit = 11.8 - 0.196 = 11.604 ounces\nUpper limit = 11.8 + 0.196 = 11.996 ounces\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of coffee per cup for this company is (11.604 ounces, 11.996 ounces)."
