    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network in a given month, we can use the historical data provided.\n\nThere have been 3 ransomware attacks in the past 30 months. So, the probability of an attack occurring in a single month can be calculated as:\n\n(Number of ransomware attacks) / (Total number of months) = 3 / 30\n\nNow, simplify the fraction:\n\n3 / 30 = 1 / 10\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network in a given month is 1/10 or 0.1, which is equivalent to 10%."
