    "message_2": "To determine whether the given modal logic formula is valid or invalid, we will use the semantics of modal logic and consider possible worlds.\n\nThe formula is: ◊(p → q) → (◊p → ◊q)\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. ◊(p → q) means there exists a possible world where (p → q) is true.\n2. ◊p means there exists a possible world where p is true.\n3. ◊q means there exists a possible world where q is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases:\n\nCase 1: There exists a possible world where (p → q) is true.\nIn this case, if there exists a possible world where p is true, then there must also exist a possible world where q is true (since p → q is true in that world). This means that (◊p → ◊q) is true in this case.\n\nCase 2: There does not exist a possible world where (p → q) is true.\nIn this case, ◊(p → q) is false. Since the antecedent of the implication (◊(p → q)) is false, the entire implication (◊(p → q) → (◊p → ◊q)) is true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (◊p → ◊q).\n\nIn both cases, the formula (◊(p → q) → (◊p → ◊q)) is true. Therefore, the given modal logic formula is valid."
