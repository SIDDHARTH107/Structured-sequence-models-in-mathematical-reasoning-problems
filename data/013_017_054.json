    "message_1": "A game show offers a prize of $10,000 to the contestant who has the lowest unique bid among all the other contestants. Suppose there are 10 contestants in total, and each contestant can only see the bids of the other contestants after they have placed their own bid. However, each contestant knows their own valuation for the prize and the probabilities of the other contestants' valuations, as follows:\n\n- Contestant 1 values the prize at $8,000, and knows that there is a 20% chance that each of the other contestants values the prize at $8,000, a 10% chance that each of the other contestants values the prize at $10,000, and a 5% chance that each of the other contestants values the prize at $12,000.\n- Contestant 2 values the prize at $9,000, and knows that there is a 10% chance that each of the other contestants values the prize at $8,000, a 20% chance that each of the other contestants values the prize at $9,000, and a 10% chance that each of the other contestants values the prize at $10,000.\n- And so on, up to Contestant 10 who values the prize at $12,000.\n\nWhat bid should Contestant 1 place if they want to maximize their chance of winning the $10,000 prize?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chance of winning, Contestant 1 should place a bid slightly above their valuation of $8,000, but below the valuation of the next contestant, which is $9,000. This is because Contestant 1 knows that there is a 20% chance that each of the other contestants values the prize at $8,000, and they want to avoid bidding the same amount as those contestants.\n\nLet's say Contestant 1 bids $8,001. This bid is unique and higher than their valuation, but lower than the valuation of Contestant 2. If any of the other contestants value the prize at $8,000, they are likely to bid below $8,001, which would make Contestant 1's bid the lowest unique bid. If any of the other contestants value the prize at $10,000 or $12,000, they are likely to bid above $8,001, which would not affect Contestant 1's bid being the lowest unique bid.\n\nBy bidding $8,001, Contestant 1 maximizes their chance of winning the $10,000 prize while still maintaining a profit, as their valuation of the prize is $8,000."
