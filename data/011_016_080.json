    "message_1": "A school wants to create soccer teams for an upcoming tournament. Each team must have exactly 5 players, and there are 20 students who want to play. How many different teams can be formed? (hint: use the concept of combinations)",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different teams that can be formed, we can use the concept of combinations. In this case, we are choosing 5 players out of 20, which can be represented as 20C5.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items we want to choose, and ! denotes the factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, in this case, we have:\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!(20-5)!)\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!15!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n20! = 20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16 × 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nNow, let's plug these factorials back into the formula:\n\nC(20, 5) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16 × 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can cancel out the common terms in the numerator and the denominator:\n\nC(20, 5) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nNow, let's perform the calculation:\n\nC(20, 5) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\nC(20, 5) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16) / 120\nC(20, 5) = 15504\n\nSo, there are 15,504 different teams that can be formed from the 20 students."
