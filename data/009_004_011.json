The system is initially pulled 5 cm from its equilibrium position and then released. Determine the displacement equation for the mass as a function of time, assuming no damping in the system.",
    "message_2": "To determine the displacement equation for the mass as a function of time, we can use the formula for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, let's find the angular frequency (ω). We can use the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (10 N/m) and m is the mass (2 kg).\n\nω = √(10/2) = √5 rad/s\n\nNow, let's determine the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ). Since the system is initially pulled 5 cm (0.05 m) from its equilibrium position and then released, the initial displacement is 0.05 m, and the initial velocity is 0 m/s. Therefore, the amplitude A is 0.05 m.\n\nTo find the phase angle (φ), we can use the initial conditions. At t = 0, x(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.05 m, and the initial velocity v(0) = -Aω * sin(φ) = 0 m/s.\n\nSince cos(φ) = 1 when φ = 0, and sin(φ) = 0 when φ = 0, we can conclude that the phase angle φ is 0.\n\nNow we can write the displacement equation for the mass as a function of time:\n\nx(t) = 0.05 * cos(√5 * t)"
