    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G, denoted by λ(G), is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges that, when removed, will result in at least one vertex being disconnected from the rest of the graph.\n\nMenger's theorem states that the edge connectivity λ(G) is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in the graph G.\n\nSince G is a connected undirected graph with 9 vertices and 16 edges, we can use the following inequality to find the edge connectivity:\n\nλ(G) ≤ min{deg(v) | v ∈ V(G)}\n\nwhere deg(v) is the degree of vertex v, and V(G) is the set of vertices in G.\n\nLet's find the minimum degree of the vertices in G. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nΣ deg(v) = 2 * |E(G)|\n\nwhere E(G) is the set of edges in G.\n\nΣ deg(v) = 2 * 16 = 32\n\nSince there are 9 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in G is:\n\n32 / 9 ≈ 3.56\n\nSince the average degree is between 3 and 4, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less. Let's assume the minimum degree is 3 (it cannot be less than 3, as the graph would not be connected otherwise).\n\nTherefore, the edge connectivity λ(G) is at most 3. Since we don't have more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact edge connectivity, but we can conclude that:\n\nλ(G) ≤ 3"
