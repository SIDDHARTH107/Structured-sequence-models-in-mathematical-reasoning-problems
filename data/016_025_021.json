    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve construction is a fractal pattern that consists of equilateral triangles. At each level, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 3. The total number of triangles at the nth level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal number of triangles = 3^n - 1\n\nFor the 10th level of the Sierpinski sieve construction:\n\nTotal number of triangles = 3^10 - 1 = 59049 - 1 = 59048"
