    "message_2": "According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nSince a planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing, the maximum number of edges can be found by maximizing the number of faces.\n\nIn a planar graph, each face must be enclosed by at least 3 edges. Therefore, we have:\n\nE ≥ 3F/2\n\nNow, we can substitute this inequality into Euler's formula:\n\nV - E + F = 2\nV - (3F/2) + F = 2\n2V - 3F + 2F = 4\n2V - F = 4\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of edges, we need to maximize the number of faces. From the equation above, we have:\n\nF = 2V - 4\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the inequality:\n\nE ≥ 3F/2\nE ≥ 3(2V - 4)/2\nE ≥ 3(V - 2)\n\nSince we have 7 vertices (V = 7), we can find the maximum number of edges:\n\nE ≥ 3(7 - 2)\nE ≥ 3(5)\nE ≥ 15\n\nHowever, this is an inequality, and we need to find the maximum number of edges that satisfy the conditions of a planar graph. The closest integer value less than or equal to 15 that satisfies the conditions is 15 itself. Therefore, the maximum number of edges a planar graph with 7 vertices can have is 15."
