    "message_2": "Sparse matrices are matrices with a significant number of zero elements. In this case, the given system of linear equations does not have a significant number of zero elements, so using sparse matrices would not be beneficial. Instead, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion to solve the system.\n\nHowever, I will still solve the system of linear equations for x, y, and z using matrix inversion.\n\nFirst, write the system of linear equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2  5  1 |\n    |-3  1  4 |\n\nB = | 4 |\n    | 1 |\n    | 5 |\n\nTo find X, we can use the formula X = A^(-1) * B, where A^(-1) is the inverse of matrix A.\n\nFirst, find the inverse of matrix A. Using a matrix calculator or by hand, we get:\n\nA^(-1) = |  13/8   -1/4  -1/8  |\n         |   3/8   -1/4   1/8  |\n         |  11/8    1/4  -1/8  |\n\nNow, multiply A^(-1) by B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B = |  13/8   -1/4  -1/8  |  | 4 |\n                 |   3/8   -1/4   1/8  |  | 1 |\n                 |  11/8    1/4  -1/8  |  | 5 |\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n    | 3 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
