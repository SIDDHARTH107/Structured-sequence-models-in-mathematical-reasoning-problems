    "message_1": "A force of 10 N is acting due east and another force of 8 N is acting due north. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on the object using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the net force, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since the forces are acting perpendicular to each other (east and north). Let F_net be the net force, F_east be the force acting due east, and F_north be the force acting due north.\n\nF_net^2 = F_east^2 + F_north^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nF_net^2 = (10 N)^2 + (8 N)^2\nF_net^2 = 100 N^2 + 64 N^2\nF_net^2 = 164 N^2\n\nNow, find the square root to get the magnitude of the net force:\n\nF_net = √(164 N^2) ≈ 12.81 N\n\nNext, we need to find the direction of the net force. We can use the tangent function to find the angle θ between the net force and the eastward force:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(θ) = F_north / F_east\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\ntan(θ) = (8 N) / (10 N)\ntan(θ) = 0.8\n\nNow, find the inverse tangent (arctan) to get the angle:\n\nθ = arctan(0.8) ≈ 38.66°\n\nSo, the net force acting on the object is approximately 12.81 N in the direction of 38.66° north of east."
