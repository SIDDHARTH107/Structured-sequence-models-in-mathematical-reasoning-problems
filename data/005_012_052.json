    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to estimate the average length of a certain type of wire they produce. The population standard deviation is known to be 2.5 cm. The manufacturer collects a sample of 30 wires and finds the sample mean to be 12.4 cm. Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the true average length of the wires.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 90% confidence interval for the true average length of the wires, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Z-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nHere, the sample mean is 12.4 cm, the population standard deviation is 2.5 cm, and the sample size is 30. For a 90% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.645 (you can find this value in a Z-score table).\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nConfidence Interval = 12.4 ± (1.645 * (2.5 / √30))\n\nConfidence Interval = 12.4 ± (1.645 * (2.5 / 5.477))\n\nConfidence Interval = 12.4 ± (1.645 * 0.456)\n\nConfidence Interval = 12.4 ± 0.751\n\nSo, the 90% confidence interval for the true average length of the wires is (11.649, 13.151) cm. This means that we can be 90% confident that the true average length of the wires lies between 11.649 cm and 13.151 cm."
