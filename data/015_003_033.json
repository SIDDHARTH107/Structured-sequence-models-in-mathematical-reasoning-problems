    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (λ) for the logistic map can be calculated using the formula:\n\nλ = ln |r - 2r * x|\n\nwhere r is the parameter value, and x is the fixed point of the logistic map. The logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nFor r = 3.2, we first need to find the fixed point x. To do this, we set x(n+1) = x(n) = x and solve for x:\n\nx = 3.2 * x * (1 - x)\n\nx - 3.2x^2 = 0\n\nx(1 - 3.2x) = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: x = 0 and x = 1/3.2. Since the fixed point should be in the interval (0, 1), we choose x = 1/3.2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nλ = ln |3.2 - 2 * 3.2 * (1/3.2)|\n\nλ = ln |3.2 - 2|\n\nλ = ln(1.2)\n\nλ ≈ 0.1823\n\nSo, the Lyapunov exponent for the logistic map with r = 3.2 is approximately 0.1823."
