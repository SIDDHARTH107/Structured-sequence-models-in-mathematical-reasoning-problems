    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the basic equations of motion. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is constant at -9.8 m/s^2. \n\n1. First, we need to find the equation for the velocity of the ball as a function of time (v(t)). Since acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, we can write:\n\na(t) = dv/dt\n\nwhere a(t) = -9.8 m/s^2 (constant) and v(t) is the velocity function we want to find.\n\n2. To find v(t), we need to integrate a(t) with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫(-9.8) dt = -9.8t + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n3. To find the value of C, we use the initial condition that the velocity at t=0 is 30 m/s:\n\n30 = -9.8(0) + C\nC = 30\n\nSo, the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = -9.8t + 30\n\n4. Now we can find the velocity of the ball after 2 seconds by plugging t=2 into the velocity function:\n\nv(2) = -9.8(2) + 30 = -19.6 + 30 = 10.4 m/s\n\n5. The acceleration of the ball after 2 seconds is the same as the acceleration due to gravity since it is constant:\n\na(2) = -9.8 m/s^2\n\nSo, the velocity of the ball after 2 seconds is 10.4 m/s, and the acceleration is -9.8 m/s^2."
