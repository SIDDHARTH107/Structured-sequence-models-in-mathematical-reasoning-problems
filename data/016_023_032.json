    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (the four smaller squares and the central square). The scaling factor s can be determined from the given size of each square in the 4th iteration, which is 0.25 units.\n\nSince the size of each square in the 4th iteration is 0.25 units, we can find the scaling factor by taking the fourth root of 0.25:\n\ns = (0.25)^(1/4) = 0.5\n\nNow we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(5) / log(0.5) â‰ˆ 2.161\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the size of each square in the 4th iteration is 0.25 units is approximately 2.161."
