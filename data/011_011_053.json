    "message_1": "Sarah has an unlimited number of identical red, blue, and green tiles. How many ways can she arrange these tiles in a line such that each group of tiles of the same color contains at least 4 tiles?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the problem step by step. Since each group of tiles of the same color must contain at least 4 tiles, we can start by looking at the smallest possible arrangement of tiles that meets this condition.\n\n1. If Sarah uses only one color, there is only 1 way to arrange the tiles (all tiles are of the same color).\n\n2. If Sarah uses two colors, she can arrange them in two ways: AABB or BBAA (where A and B represent different colors). In each case, there are at least 4 tiles of each color.\n\n3. If Sarah uses all three colors, we need to consider different cases:\n\n   a) Each color appears exactly once in the arrangement: There are 6 possible arrangements (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA), but none of them meet the condition of having at least 4 tiles of each color.\n\n   b) One color appears twice, and the other two colors appear once: There are 3 possible arrangements (AABC, ABBC, ABCC), but none of them meet the condition of having at least 4 tiles of each color.\n\n   c) One color appears three times, and the other two colors appear once: There is only 1 possible arrangement (AAABC), but it does not meet the condition of having at least 4 tiles of each color.\n\n   d) Each color appears at least twice: The smallest arrangement that meets this condition is AAABBBCCC. There are 6 possible arrangements (AAABBBCCC, AAACCBBCC, AAACCCBBB, BBBAAACCC, BBBCCCAAA, CCCAAABBB). In each case, there are at least 4 tiles of each color.\n\nIn summary, there are 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 ways for Sarah to arrange the tiles in a line such that each group of tiles of the same color contains at least 4 tiles."
