    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nRecall that the Sylow Theorems state the following:\n\n1. For any prime p, if p^k divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^k.\n2. All subgroups of order p^k are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of subgroups of order p^k, denoted n_p, divides the index of p^k in the order of G, and n_p is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 18. Since 18 = 2 * 3^2, we can apply the Sylow Theorems to find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, n_2 divides 9 (the index of 2 in 18) and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2, which is normal in G.\n\nNext, let's find the Sylow 3-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, n_3 divides 2 (the index of 3^2 in 18) and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possible value for n_3 is 1. Thus, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9, which is normal in G.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2 and Q be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. Since both P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have |PQ| = |P||Q| = 2 * 9 = 18. Thus, PQ = G.\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2, which is normal in G. Since G = PQ, we can write G as a semi-direct product of P and Q. Since P is of order 2, it is isomorphic to C2 (the cyclic group of order 2). Q, being of order 9, is isomorphic to C9 (the cyclic group of order 9). Thus, G is isomorphic to the semi-direct product of C2 and C9.\n\nIf the action of P on Q is trivial, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of C2 and C9, which is C18 (the cyclic group of order 18). If the action of P on Q is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9\nIn this case, G has 9 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 2. However, this case is not possible since it would imply that G has 9 * 2 = 18 elements of order 2, which is not possible in a group of order 18.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to either C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
