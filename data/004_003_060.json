    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular pen be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the farmer has 100 meters of fencing, we have:\n\n100 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we can solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (100 - 2L) / 2\nW = 50 - L\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by:\n\nA = L * W\nA = L * (50 - L)\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area A, so we will find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to L and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dL = d(L * (50 - L))/dL\ndA/dL = 50 - 2L\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0 to find the critical points:\n\n0 = 50 - 2L\n2L = 50\nL = 25\n\nNow, we can find the width W using the expression we found earlier:\n\nW = 50 - L\nW = 50 - 25\nW = 25\n\nSo, the dimensions that will maximize the area of the rectangular pen are length L = 25 meters and width W = 25 meters. The maximum area is:\n\nA = L * W\nA = 25 * 25\nA = 625 square meters"
