    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x - 7| = 10, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 7 is positive or zero, so the equation becomes:\n3x - 7 = 10\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n3x = 17\nx = 17/3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 7 is negative, so the equation becomes:\n-(3x - 7) = 10\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n-3x + 7 = 10\n-3x = 3\nx = -1\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 17/3 and -1."
