    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node D, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and a table to store the shortest distance from the starting node (A) to each node. Initialize the distance to A as 0 and the distances to all other nodes as infinity.\n\n   Unvisited: {A, B, C, D}\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: ∞, C: ∞, D: ∞}\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance value (A) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (B and C) if the path through the current node is shorter.\n\n   Visited: {A}\n   Unvisited: {B, C, D}\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: 5, C: 3, D: ∞}\n\n3. Select the node with the smallest distance value among the unvisited nodes (C) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (D) if the path through the current node is shorter.\n\n   Visited: {A, C}\n   Unvisited: {B, D}\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: 5, C: 3, D: 5}\n\n4. Select the node with the smallest distance value among the unvisited nodes (B) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (C and D) if the path through the current node is shorter. In this case, the distances do not need to be updated.\n\n   Visited: {A, C, B}\n   Unvisited: {D}\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: 5, C: 3, D: 5}\n\n5. Finally, select the node with the smallest distance value among the unvisited nodes (D) and mark it as visited. Since this is the destination node, we can stop the algorithm.\n\n   Visited: {A, C, B, D}\n   Unvisited: {}\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: 5, C: 3, D: 5}\n\nThe shortest path from node A to node D is A->C->D with a total weight of 5."
