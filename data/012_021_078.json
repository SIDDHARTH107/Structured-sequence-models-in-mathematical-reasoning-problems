    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of the given graph, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the vertex set V.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in E, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in V, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nWe can construct a tree decomposition for the given graph as follows:\n\n1. Create a bag {1, 2, 3} which covers edges (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3).\n2. Create a bag {2, 3, 4} which covers edges (2,4).\n3. Create a bag {3, 4, 5} which covers edges (3,5) and (4,5).\n\nNow, connect the bags in a tree-like structure:\n\n       {1, 2, 3}\n       /     \\\n{2, 3, 4} - {3, 4, 5}\n\nThis tree decomposition satisfies all three conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n2. All edges are covered by at least one bag.\n3. The bags containing each vertex form a connected subtree.\n\nThe treewidth of a graph is the minimum size of the largest bag in a tree decomposition minus one. In this case, the largest bag size is 3, so the treewidth of the graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
