    "message_2": "The sparse matrix method is not applicable to this system of linear equations, as it is used for matrices with a significant number of zero elements. In this case, the given system of linear equations has no zero elements in the coefficient matrix.\n\nInstead, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve the system of linear equations.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + 3y + z = 11\n4x + 5y + 3z = 20\nx + 2y + 4z = 14\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by -1 and add it to the third equation:\n\n2*(2x + 3y + z) - (4x + 5y + 3z) = 2*11 - 20\n-1*(2x + 3y + z) + (x + 2y + 4z) = -11 + 14\n\nThis results in:\n\n2x + 3y + z = 11\n-y - z = -2\n-y + 3z = 3\n\nNow, we will eliminate y from the third equation. To do this, we can add the second equation to the third equation:\n\n(-y - z) + (-y + 3z) = -2 + 3\n\nThis results in:\n\n2x + 3y + z = 11\n-y - z = -2\n2z = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = 1/2\n\nNext, we can substitute z back into the second equation to solve for y:\n\n-y - (1/2) = -2\n-y = -3/2\ny = 3/2\n\nFinally, we can substitute y and z back into the first equation to solve for x:\n\n2x + 3(3/2) + (1/2) = 11\n2x + 9/2 + 1/2 = 11\n2x = 11 - 10/2\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 3/2, and z = 1/2."
