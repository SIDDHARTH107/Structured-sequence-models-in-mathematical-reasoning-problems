    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve constructed using an L-system. The perimeter of the Gosper curve increases with each iteration. \n\nFor the Gosper curve, the length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength after n iterations = (initial length) * (multiplier)^n\n\nThe multiplier for the Gosper curve is 7^(2/3), which is approximately 2.99794.\n\nGiven that the initial equilateral triangle has a side length of 5 cm, the initial length of the curve is 3 * 5 = 15 cm.\n\nNow, we can calculate the length of the curve after four iterations:\n\nLength after 4 iterations = 15 * (2.99794)^4 ≈ 15 * 80.056 ≈ 1200.84 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Gosper curve after four iterations is approximately 1200.84 cm."
