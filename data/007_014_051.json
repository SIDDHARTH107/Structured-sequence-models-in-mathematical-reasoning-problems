    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128.\n\nThe fifth perfect number can be found using the formula for even perfect numbers, which is given by:\n\n(2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1)\n\nwhere p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\nFor the fifth perfect number, we need to find the next pair of prime numbers p and (2^p - 1) after the first four pairs:\n\n1. p = 2, (2^2 - 1) = 3\n2. p = 3, (2^3 - 1) = 7\n3. p = 5, (2^5 - 1) = 31\n4. p = 7, (2^7 - 1) = 127\n\nThe next pair is:\n\n5. p = 13, (2^13 - 1) = 8191 (both are prime numbers)\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the fifth perfect number:\n\n(2^(13-1)) * (2^13 - 1) = (2^12) * (8191) = 4096 * 8191 = 33,550,336\n\nSo, the fifth perfect number is 33,550,336."
