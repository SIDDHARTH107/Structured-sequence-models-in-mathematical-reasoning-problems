    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resulting vector, we need to break the force vector into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. We can use trigonometry to do this.\n\nThe horizontal component (Fx) can be found using the cosine function:\nFx = F * cos(θ)\nFx = 20 N * cos(30°)\nFx ≈ 20 N * 0.866\nFx ≈ 17.32 N\n\nThe vertical component (Fy) can be found using the sine function:\nFy = F * sin(θ)\nFy = 20 N * sin(30°)\nFy ≈ 20 N * 0.5\nFy ≈ 10 N\n\nNow that we have the horizontal and vertical components, we can find the magnitude of the resulting vector using the Pythagorean theorem:\nR = √(Fx^2 + Fy^2)\nR = √((17.32 N)^2 + (10 N)^2)\nR = √(299.9424 N^2 + 100 N^2)\nR ≈ √(399.9424 N^2)\nR ≈ 20 N\n\nThe magnitude of the resulting vector is 20 N.\n\nTo find the direction of the resulting vector, we can use the arctangent function:\ntan(θ) = Fy / Fx\nθ = arctan(Fy / Fx)\nθ = arctan(10 N / 17.32 N)\nθ ≈ 30°\n\nThe direction of the resulting vector is 30° above the horizontal.\n\nSo, the magnitude and direction of the resulting vector are 20 N and 30° above the horizontal, respectively."
