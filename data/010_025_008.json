    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface of genus 3 using topological quantum field theory, we first need to understand some basic concepts.\n\nA closed orientable surface of genus 3 is a surface that is compact (i.e., has no boundary) and has three \"holes\" or handles. The Euler characteristic (χ) of a surface is a topological invariant that describes the shape of the surface.\n\nIn topological quantum field theory, the Euler characteristic can be computed using the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, which relates the Euler characteristic to the index of certain elliptic operators on the surface. However, for our purpose, we can use a simpler approach.\n\nFor a closed orientable surface of genus g, the Euler characteristic is given by the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nIn our case, the genus g is 3, so we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface of genus 3 is -4."
