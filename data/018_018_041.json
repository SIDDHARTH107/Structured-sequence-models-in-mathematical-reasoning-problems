    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 6}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference of A and B (A Δ B):\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10} - {4, 6} = {2, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection of sets are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we can rewrite this as:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nComparing this with the expression for A Δ B, we can see that they are the same:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference is commutative:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A\n\nIn our example, A Δ B = {2, 8, 9, 10} and B Δ A = {2, 8, 9, 10}, which confirms that the symmetric difference is commutative."
