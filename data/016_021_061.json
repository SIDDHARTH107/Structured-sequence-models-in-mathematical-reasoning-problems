    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is generated by repeatedly applying a specific set of rules to an equilateral triangle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration. \n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the curve after the nth iteration as P(n). After the first iteration, the perimeter is doubled, so P(1) = 2. For each subsequent iteration, the perimeter increases by a factor of 3/2. Therefore, the perimeter after the 7th iteration can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(7) = P(1) * (3/2)^6\nP(7) = 2 * (3/2)^6\nP(7) = 2 * (729/64)\nP(7) = 1458/64\nP(7) â‰ˆ 22.78125\n\nSo, the total perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the 7th iteration is approximately 22.78125 units, assuming the initial triangular perimeter is 1 unit."
