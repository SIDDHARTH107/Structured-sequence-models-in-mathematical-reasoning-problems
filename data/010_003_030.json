Prove that X is a Hausdorff space.\n\nFor a specific example, consider the topological space X = {a, b, c} with the topology {∅, {a}, {a, b}, X}. Is this space a Hausdorff space?",
    "message_2": "To prove that X is a Hausdorff space, we need to show that for any two distinct points x, y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nBy the given condition, for every two points x, y in X, there exist open sets U and V in X such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. Since this condition holds for any two points in X, it directly implies that X is a Hausdorff space.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific example of the topological space X = {a, b, c} with the topology {∅, {a}, {a, b}, X}.\n\nTo check if this space is a Hausdorff space, we need to see if we can find disjoint open sets for any two distinct points in X.\n\n1. For points a and b:\n   - Choose U = {a} and V = {a, b}.\n   - a ∈ U and b ∈ V, but U ∩ V ≠ ∅ since a is in both U and V.\n\n2. For points a and c:\n   - Choose U = {a} and V = {a, b, c}.\n   - a ∈ U and c ∈ V, but U ∩ V ≠ ∅ since a is in both U and V.\n\n3. For points b and c:\n   - Choose U = {a, b} and V = {a, b, c}.\n   - b ∈ U and c ∈ V, but U ∩ V ≠ ∅ since both a and b are in both U and V.\n\nIn all cases, we cannot find disjoint open sets for any two distinct points in X. Therefore, this specific topological space X = {a, b, c} with the given topology is not a Hausdorff space."
