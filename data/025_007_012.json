Let $\\mathcal{O}_C(n)$ be the line bundle on $C$ associated to the divisor $n \\cdot \\operatorname{point}(P)$, where $P$ is a fixed point on $C$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Compute $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(n))$, the first cohomology group of $C$ with coefficients in the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(n)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(n))$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of the divisor $D$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of the curve $C$, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nIn our case, the curve $C$ is an elliptic curve, so its genus $g = 1$. The canonical divisor $K_C$ is equal to the divisor of a differential form on $C$. For an elliptic curve, the canonical divisor is the same as the zero divisor, so $K_C = 0$. The divisor $D = n \\cdot \\operatorname{point}(P)$ has degree $\\deg(D) = n$.\n\nNow, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute $l(D)$ and $l(K_C - D) = l(-D)$. We have:\n\n$$l(D) - l(-D) = n + 1 - 1$$\n\n$$l(D) - l(-D) = n$$\n\nWe are interested in computing $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(n)) = l(-D)$. We can rewrite the equation above as:\n\n$$l(-D) = l(D) - n$$\n\nFor $n \\geq 0$, we have $l(D) = n + 1$, so $l(-D) = 0$. This means that $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(n)) = 0$ for $n \\geq 0$.\n\nFor $n < 0$, we have $l(-D) = l(D) + n$. Since $D$ is a divisor of degree $n$, the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of $D$ has dimension at most $n$. Therefore, $l(D) \\leq n$, and $l(-D) \\leq 0$. Since $l(-D)$ is a non-negative integer, we must have $l(-D) = 0$. This means that $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(n)) = 0$ for $n < 0$ as well.\n\nIn conclusion, we have $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(n)) = 0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$."
