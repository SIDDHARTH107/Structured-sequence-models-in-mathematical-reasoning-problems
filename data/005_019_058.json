    "message_1": "A factory produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The daily production of each product is as follows: 100 units of A, 150 units of B, and 200 units of C. The percentage of defective units for each product is: 4% for A, 2% for B, and 3% for C. Suppose a customer receives a random unit from the factory's production each day. What is the probability that on the second day, the customer receives a defective unit of product B given that the customer received a non-defective unit of product A on the first day?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the events as follows:\n- A1: receiving a non-defective unit of product A on the first day\n- B2: receiving a defective unit of product B on the second day\n\nWe want to find the probability P(B2|A1).\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities of receiving each type of product:\n- P(A) = 100 / (100 + 150 + 200) = 100 / 450 = 2 / 9\n- P(B) = 150 / 450 = 1 / 3\n- P(C) = 200 / 450 = 4 / 9\n\nNow, let's find the probabilities of receiving a non-defective unit of each product:\n- P(A1) = P(non-defective A) * P(A) = 0.96 * (2 / 9) = 16 / 225\n- P(B2) = P(defective B) * P(B) = 0.02 * (1 / 3) = 1 / 150\n\nTo find P(B2|A1), we can use the formula P(B2|A1) = P(B2 âˆ© A1) / P(A1). However, since the events A1 and B2 are independent (receiving a non-defective unit of product A on the first day does not affect the probability of receiving a defective unit of product B on the second day), we can simplify this to P(B2|A1) = P(B2).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the customer receives a defective unit of product B on the second day given that they received a non-defective unit of product A on the first day is:\n\nP(B2|A1) = P(B2) = 1 / 150"
