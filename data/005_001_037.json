    "message_1": "A researcher claims that the average salary of software engineers is at least $110,000 per year. To test this claim, a random sample of 50 software engineers is taken and their salaries are recorded. The sample mean is $107,000 and the standard deviation is $5,000. \n\nCan you help the student determine if the evidence supports the researcher's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To test the researcher's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average salary of software engineers is at least $110,000 per year, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average salary is less than $110,000 per year.\n\nH0: μ ≥ $110,000\nH1: μ < $110,000\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = $107,000\nSample standard deviation (s) = $5,000\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = ($107,000 - $110,000) / ($5,000 / √50)\nt = (-$3,000) / ($5,000 / 7.071)\nt = (-$3,000) / $707.1\nt ≈ -4.25\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.676.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-4.25) is less than the critical t-value (-1.676), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the average salary of software engineers is less than $110,000 per year at a significance level of 0.05."
