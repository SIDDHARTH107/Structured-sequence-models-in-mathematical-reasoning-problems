    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a large tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedrons. At each stage, the number of small tetrahedrons increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the number of small tetrahedrons needed to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron up to the fourth stage, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = (4^n - 1) / (4 - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of stages.\n\nFor the fourth stage (n = 4):\n\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = (4^4 - 1) / (4 - 1)\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = (256 - 1) / 3\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = 255 / 3\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = 85\n\nSo, 85 small tetrahedrons are needed to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron up to the fourth stage, starting with one large tetrahedron."
