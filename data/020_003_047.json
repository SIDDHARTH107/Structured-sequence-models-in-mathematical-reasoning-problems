    "message_2": "To minimize the function f(x) subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 <= 16, we first need to find the critical points of f(x) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x + 4\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0:\n\n4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the approximate critical points. Using a numerical solver, we find that the critical points are approximately x ≈ 0.535 and x ≈ 2.732.\n\nNow, we need to check the boundary of the constraint x^2 + y^2 <= 16. Since the constraint is a circle with radius 4, we need to evaluate f(x) at x = -4 and x = 4:\n\nf(-4) = (-4)^4 - 4(-4)^3 + 6(-4)^2 + 4(-4) - 5 = 341\nf(4) = (4)^4 - 4(4)^3 + 6(4)^2 + 4(4) - 5 = -21\n\nNow, we evaluate f(x) at the critical points:\n\nf(0.535) ≈ 0.535^4 - 4(0.535)^3 + 6(0.535)^2 + 4(0.535) - 5 ≈ -3.924\nf(2.732) ≈ 2.732^4 - 4(2.732)^3 + 6(2.732)^2 + 4(2.732) - 5 ≈ -0.018\n\nComparing the values of f(x) at the critical points and the boundary, we find that the minimum value of f(x) subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 <= 16 is approximately -3.924, which occurs at x ≈ 0.535."
