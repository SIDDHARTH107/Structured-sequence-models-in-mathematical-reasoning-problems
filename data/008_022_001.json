    "message_1": "Here's a problem for the student to solve: \n\nConsider the system of linear equations \n\n2x + 3y - z = 10 \n\n4x + 7y - 3z = 20 \n\n6x + 10y - 5z = 30 \n\nDetermine whether the system of equations has a unique solution, no solution or infinitely many solutions. If a system has a unique solution, then solve the system. \n\nNote: The coefficient matrix of the system is nearly singular, so there will not be a unique solution necessarily.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the system of equations has a unique solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to transform the augmented matrix of the system into its row echelon form.\n\nThe augmented matrix of the system is:\n\n| 2  3  -1 | 10 |\n| 4  7  -3 | 20 |\n| 6  10 -5 | 30 |\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows. To do this, we can subtract twice the first row from the second row and three times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 2  3  -1 | 10 |\n| 0  1  -1 |  0 |\n| 0  1  -2 |  0 |\n\nNow, we can eliminate the y term in the third row by subtracting the second row from the third row:\n\n| 2  3  -1 | 10 |\n| 0  1  -1 |  0 |\n| 0  0  -1 |  0 |\n\nNow, the augmented matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that the third row represents the equation -z = 0, which means z = 0. \n\nNow we can use back-substitution to find the values of y and x. From the second row, we have y - z = y = 0, so y = 0 as well. Finally, from the first row, we have 2x + 3y - z = 2x = 10, which means x = 5.\n\nSo, the system of equations has a unique solution: x = 5, y = 0, and z = 0."
