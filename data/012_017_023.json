    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges. Determine whether the graph has a perfect matching or not. If it has a perfect matching, find the matching.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph has a perfect matching, we can use Tutte's theorem. Tutte's theorem states that a graph G has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of its vertices, the number of odd components of G - U (the graph obtained by removing the vertices in U and their incident edges) is less than or equal to the number of vertices in U.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot apply Tutte's theorem directly. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the graph has a perfect matching or not without more information about the graph's structure or adjacency matrix.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the graph, we can help you determine whether it has a perfect matching and find the matching if it exists."
