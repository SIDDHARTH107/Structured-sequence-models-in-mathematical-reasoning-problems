    "message_2": "Let S be a set with 3 elements, say S = {a, b, c}. The power set of S, denoted as P(S), is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.\n\nTo find the total number of elements in the power set of S, we can consider each element in S and decide whether to include it in a subset or not. There are 2 choices for each element (either include it or don't include it), and since there are 3 elements in S, there are 2^3 = 8 possible subsets.\n\nSo, the power set of S, P(S) = {âˆ…, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of S and P(S). The set S has 3 elements, while the power set P(S) has 8 elements. Since 8 > 3, the power set P(S) is always larger than the set S itself. This can be generalized for any set S with n elements, as the power set will always have 2^n elements, which is always greater than n for any positive integer n."
