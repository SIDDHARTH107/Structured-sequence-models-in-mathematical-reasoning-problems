    "message_2": "To prove that there exist distinct elements a, b, and c in A such that a < b < c, we will show that we can construct such elements using the given language L.\n\nSince A has at least three elements, there must be at least one element that is not 0. Let's call this element a. Since a is not 0, it must be the successor of some element in A. In other words, a = s(x) for some x in A.\n\nNow, let's consider the element b = s(a). Since a is not 0, b is not the successor of 0, and therefore b is distinct from a. Moreover, since a = s(x) and b = s(a), we have that b = s(s(x)). By the definition of the successor function and the less than relation, we have that a < b.\n\nNext, let's consider the element c = s(b). Since b is not 0, c is not the successor of 0, and therefore c is distinct from both a and b. Moreover, since b = s(a) and c = s(b), we have that c = s(s(a)). By the definition of the successor function and the less than relation, we have that b < c.\n\nThus, we have constructed distinct elements a, b, and c in A such that a < b < c, as required."
