    "message_2": "If a person enters from one of the 8 entrances, they have 7 remaining options for exits since they cannot exit from the entrance they entered from. So, for each of the 8 entrances, there are 7 possible exits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways a person can enter and exit the park is 8 entrances * 7 exits = 56 ways."
