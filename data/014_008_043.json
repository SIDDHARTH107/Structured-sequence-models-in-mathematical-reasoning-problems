    "message_1": "Assume a block cipher uses a key size of 128 bits and a block size of 64 bits. The cipher employs 16 rounds of encryption, with each round consisting of a substitution-permutation network (SPN) round function that operates on 4 bytes at a time. What is the total number of SPN operations performed by the cipher for encrypting a single block of plaintext?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total number of SPN operations performed by the cipher for encrypting a single block of plaintext, we need to consider the number of rounds and the size of the block being processed in each round.\n\nThe cipher has 16 rounds of encryption, and each round operates on 4 bytes (32 bits) at a time. The block size is 64 bits, which means that there are two 32-bit segments in each block.\n\nSince the SPN round function operates on each 32-bit segment in every round, we can calculate the total number of SPN operations as follows:\n\nTotal SPN operations = (Number of rounds) × (Number of 32-bit segments per block)\nTotal SPN operations = 16 rounds × 2 segments\nTotal SPN operations = 32\n\nSo, the cipher performs a total of 32 SPN operations for encrypting a single block of plaintext."
