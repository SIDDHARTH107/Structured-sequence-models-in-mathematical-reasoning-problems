    "message_1": "In a recent theater show, there are 25 acrobats performing. The probability that any one acrobat will successfully complete a particular stunt is 0.75. What is the probability that at least 20 acrobats will successfully complete the stunt?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 20 acrobats will successfully complete the stunt, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (0.75 in this case)\n- n is the total number of trials (25 acrobats)\n- k is the number of successful trials (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 20 successes, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25.\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + P(X = 22) + P(X = 23) + P(X = 24) + P(X = 25)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 20) = C(25, 20) * 0.75^20 * 0.25^5\nP(X = 21) = C(25, 21) * 0.75^21 * 0.25^4\nP(X = 22) = C(25, 22) * 0.75^22 * 0.25^3\nP(X = 23) = C(25, 23) * 0.75^23 * 0.25^2\nP(X = 24) = C(25, 24) * 0.75^24 * 0.25^1\nP(X = 25) = C(25, 25) * 0.75^25 * 0.25^0\n\nCalculating these probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X = 20) ≈ 0.166\nP(X = 21) ≈ 0.218\nP(X = 22) ≈ 0.207\nP(X = 23) ≈ 0.138\nP(X = 24) ≈ 0.058\nP(X = 25) ≈ 0.011\n\nNow, we can sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) ≈ 0.166 + 0.218 + 0.207 + 0.138 + 0.058 + 0.011 ≈ 0.798\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 acrobats will successfully complete the stunt is approximately 0.798 or 79.8%."
