    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA force of 20 Newtons is applied to a box to move it a distance of 5 meters along a straight path. Find the work done by the force in joules, assuming the force is applied in the same direction as the displacement. Use calculus and integration to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = ∫F(x)dx from x=a to x=b\n\nIn this case, the force F(x) is constant and equal to 20 Newtons. The limits of integration are the initial position (a = 0) and the final position (b = 5 meters). So, we have:\n\nWork = ∫(20)dx from x=0 to x=5\n\nNow, we can integrate the constant force function:\n\n∫(20)dx = 20x + C\n\nTo find the work done, we need to evaluate this function at the limits of integration:\n\nWork = (20 * 5) - (20 * 0) = 100 Joules\n\nSo, the work done by the force in moving the box 5 meters along a straight path is 100 Joules."
