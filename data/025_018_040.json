Suppose that for every irreducible curve C contained in X, there exists an irreducible curve D contained in Y such that f(C) = D. \n\nSuppose further that there exists an ample divisor H on Y such that f^*H is an ample divisor on X. \n\nLet F be a nef divisor on X and assume that F^2 > 0.\n\nFind the largest integer a such that F - a f^*H is still nef.",
    "message_2": "To find the largest integer a such that F - a f^*H is still nef, we will use the intersection theory on divisors.\n\nSince F is nef, we have F.C ≥ 0 for every curve C in X. Also, since f^*H is ample, we have (f^*H).C > 0 for every curve C in X.\n\nNow consider the intersection product (F - a f^*H).C for any curve C in X. We want this to be non-negative for F - a f^*H to be nef. So, we have:\n\n(F - a f^*H).C = F.C - a(f^*H).C ≥ 0.\n\nSince (f^*H).C > 0, we can divide both sides by (f^*H).C:\n\nF.C / (f^*H).C - a ≥ 0.\n\nNow, let's define the real number b = sup{F.C / (f^*H).C | C is an irreducible curve in X}. Since F and f^*H are both nef, b is well-defined and non-negative.\n\nWe claim that a = floor(b) is the largest integer such that F - a f^*H is still nef. To see this, note that for any curve C in X, we have:\n\nF.C / (f^*H).C - floor(b) ≥ 0.\n\nMultiplying both sides by (f^*H).C, we get:\n\nF.C - floor(b)(f^*H).C ≥ 0.\n\nThis implies that (F - floor(b) f^*H).C ≥ 0, which means F - floor(b) f^*H is nef.\n\nNow, we need to show that F - (floor(b) + 1) f^*H is not nef. Suppose for contradiction that F - (floor(b) + 1) f^*H is nef. Then for any curve C in X, we have:\n\n(F - (floor(b) + 1) f^*H).C ≥ 0.\n\nThis implies:\n\nF.C - (floor(b) + 1)(f^*H).C ≥ 0.\n\nDividing both sides by (f^*H).C, we get:\n\nF.C / (f^*H).C - (floor(b) + 1) ≥ 0.\n\nThis contradicts the definition of b as the supremum, since we have found a value greater than b. Therefore, F - (floor(b) + 1) f^*H is not nef.\n\nHence, the largest integer a such that F - a f^*H is still nef is a = floor(b)."
