    "message_2": "Suppose for contradiction that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 x C6. Then, there exists an isomorphism φ: G → C10 x C6. \n\nRecall that the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group. Also, recall that the order of an element in a direct product of groups is the least common multiple of the orders of its components.\n\nNow, consider the orders of the elements in C10 x C6. The order of an element (a, b) in C10 x C6 is lcm(o(a), o(b)), where o(a) is the order of a in C10 and o(b) is the order of b in C6. The possible orders of elements in C10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10, and the possible orders of elements in C6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in C10 x C6 are lcm(1, 1) = 1, lcm(2, 2) = 2, lcm(2, 3) = 6, lcm(5, 1) = 5, and lcm(10, 1) = 10. \n\nNow, let's consider the order of G. Since |G| = 60, by Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element of order p in G for each prime p dividing 60. The prime divisors of 60 are 2, 3, and 5. Thus, there must exist elements of orders 2, 3, and 5 in G.\n\nSince φ is an isomorphism, it preserves the order of elements. Therefore, there must exist elements of orders 2, 3, and 5 in C10 x C6. We already know that there are elements of orders 2, 5, and 10 in C10 x C6, but there is no element of order 3. This contradicts the fact that φ is an isomorphism, as it cannot preserve the order of an element of order 3 in G.\n\nHence, G cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 x C6."
