    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 2x + 1 between x = 0 and x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = 2x + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\n∫(2x + 1) dx = ∫(2x) dx + ∫(1) dx\n\nNow, integrate each term:\n\n∫(2x) dx = x^2 + C1 (since the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) when n ≠ -1)\n\n∫(1) dx = x + C2 (since the integral of a constant is the constant times x)\n\nSo, the integral of the function is:\n\n∫(2x + 1) dx = x^2 + x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral at the given limits, x = 0 and x = 4:\n\nArea = [x^2 + x] (from 0 to 4)\n\nArea = (4^2 + 4) - (0^2 + 0)\n\nArea = (16 + 4) - (0)\n\nArea = 20\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 2x + 1 between x = 0 and x = 4 is 20 square units."
