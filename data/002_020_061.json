    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector of a circle, we need to calculate the arc length of the sector and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the arc length. The formula for the arc length (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven, the radius (r) is 20 meters and the central angle (θ) is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2π(20)\nL = (1/6) × 40π\nL = 40π/6\nL = 20π/3 meters\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter = (20π/3) + 2(20)\nPerimeter = (20π/3) + 40\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (20π/3) + 40 meters."
