    "message_2": "To prove that $f(z)$ is a constant function, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic (analytic) in a bounded domain and continuous up to its boundary, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is an entire function, it is holomorphic on the entire complex plane. Let's consider a closed disk $D$ with radius $R$ centered at the origin, i.e., $D = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\leq R\\}$. Note that $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the interior of $D$ and continuous on the boundary of $D$.\n\nBy the Maximum Modulus Principle, the maximum of $|f(z)|$ on $D$ is attained on the boundary of $D$, i.e., $|f(z)| \\leq \\max_{|z|=R} |f(z)|$ for all $z$ in the interior of $D$. However, we are given that $|f(z)| \\leq 5$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, the maximum of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary of $D$ is also less than or equal to 5.\n\nSince the radius $R$ of the disk $D$ was arbitrary, we can conclude that the maximum of $|f(z)|$ is less than or equal to 5 for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This means that $f(z)$ is a bounded entire function.\n\nNow, we will use Liouville's Theorem, which states that every bounded entire function is constant. Since $f(z)$ is a bounded entire function, by Liouville's Theorem, it must be a constant function. Therefore, $f(z)$ is a constant function."
