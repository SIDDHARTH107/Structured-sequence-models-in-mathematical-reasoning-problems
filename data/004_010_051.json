    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 7, we will integrate each term separately with respect to x.\n\nThe antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), where n is a constant.\n\nSo, for the first term, 3x^2, the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = 3x^3/3 = x^3.\n\nFor the second term, 2x, the antiderivative is (2x^(1+1))/(1+1) = 2x^2/2 = x^2.\n\nFor the third term, 7, the antiderivative is 7x, since the integral of a constant is the constant times x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 7x + C"
