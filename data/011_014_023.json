    "message_2": "Using graph theory concepts, we can model this problem as a complete graph with 8 vertices, where each vertex represents a friend and each edge represents a possible pair of friends. In a complete graph, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nThe number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = n(n-1)/2\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (since there are 8 friends). Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nE = 8(8-1)/2\nE = 8(7)/2\nE = 56/2\nE = 28\n\nSo, there are 28 different pairs of friends that can be formed for the hiking trip."
