    "message_2": "We will use the concept of modular arithmetic to solve this problem. First, we need to find the modular inverse of 17 (mod 23). We can do this using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have:\n\na^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nIn our case, p = 23 and a = 17. So, we have:\n\n17^(23-1) ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n17^22 ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder of 17^57 when divided by 23. We can rewrite 17^57 as:\n\n17^57 = (17^22)^(57//22) * 17^(57 % 22)\n17^57 = (17^22)^2 * 17^13\n\nUsing the result from Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that 17^22 ≡ 1 (mod 23). So, we have:\n\n17^57 ≡ 1^2 * 17^13 (mod 23)\n17^57 ≡ 17^13 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we just need to find the remainder of 17^13 when divided by 23. We can do this by calculating powers of 17 modulo 23:\n\n17^1 ≡ 17 (mod 23)\n17^2 ≡ 289 ≡ 4 (mod 23)\n17^4 ≡ 4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 23)\n17^8 ≡ 16^2 ≡ 256 ≡ 2 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can find 17^13:\n\n17^13 ≡ 17^8 * 17^4 * 17^1 (mod 23)\n17^13 ≡ 2 * 16 * 17 (mod 23)\n17^13 ≡ 544 (mod 23)\n\nFinally, we find the remainder of 544 when divided by 23:\n\n544 % 23 = 4\n\nSo, the remainder when 17^57 is divided by 23 is 4."
