    "message_1": "What is the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism with length 12 cm, width 6 cm, and height 8 cm? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h):\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nIn this case, l = 12 cm, w = 6 cm, and h = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nd^2 = (12)^2 + (6)^2 + (8)^2\nd^2 = 144 + 36 + 64\nd^2 = 244\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 244 to get the length of the diagonal:\n\nd = √244 ≈ 15.62 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 15.62 cm, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter."
