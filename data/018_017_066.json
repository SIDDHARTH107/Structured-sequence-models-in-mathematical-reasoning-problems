(A × B) Δ A:\n\nTo find this, we need to find the elements that are in either A × B or A, but not in both. Since A contains single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements between them. Therefore, the symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\n\n(A × B) Δ A = {(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), 0, 1}\n\n2.
