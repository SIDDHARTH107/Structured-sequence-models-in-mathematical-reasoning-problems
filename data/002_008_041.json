    "message_2": "To find the volume of a right circular cone, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 4 cm and the height h is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 4² * 10\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 16 * 10\nVolume = 3.14159 * 53.3333\nVolume ≈ 167.5516\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the volume of the cone is approximately 167.55 cubic cm."
