    "message_1": "A 10-foot ladder is sliding down a wall. The ladder is initially 8 feet from the ground and sliding at a rate of 2 feet per second. How fast is the bottom of the ladder moving away from the wall when the top of the ladder is 6 feet from the ground? (Assume the ladder is always leaning against the wall and is not slipping on the ground.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 feet long, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\nx^2 + y^2 = 100\n\nWe are also given that the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, so dy/dt = -2 (negative because the distance is decreasing). We want to find dx/dt, the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall when y = 6.\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the equation x^2 + y^2 = 100 with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = 0\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, plug in the given values: y = 6 and dy/dt = -2:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2(6)(-2) = 0\n\nTo find x when y = 6, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + 6^2 = 100\nx^2 = 100 - 36\nx^2 = 64\nx = 8\n\nNow, plug in x = 8:\n\n2(8)(dx/dt) - 24 = 0\n16(dx/dt) = 24\n\nSolve for dx/dt:\n\ndx/dt = 24/16\ndx/dt = 3/2\n\nSo, the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall at a rate of 3/2 feet per second when the top of the ladder is 6 feet from the ground."
