    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (hurricanes) in n trials (years)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (hurricane) in a single trial (year)\n- n is the number of trials (years)\n- k is the number of successes (hurricanes)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least two hurricanes (k ≥ 2) in 10 years (n = 10), with a probability of a hurricane in any given year being 0.2 (p = 0.2).\n\nTo find the probability of at least two hurricanes, we can find the probability of zero hurricanes and one hurricane, and then subtract those probabilities from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = C(10, 0) * 0.2^0 * (1-0.2)^(10-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.8^10\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.1074\n\nP(X = 1) = C(10, 1) * 0.2^1 * (1-0.2)^(10-1)\nP(X = 1) = 10 * 0.2 * 0.8^9\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.2684\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least two hurricanes:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.1074 - 0.2684\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 0.6242\n\nSo, the probability that at least two hurricanes hit the region in September over the course of 10 years is approximately 0.6242 or 62.42%."
