    "message_1": "A semiconductor company produces two types of chips, A and B. The profit obtained by the company for each type of chip is given by the following equations:\n- Profit from chip A: P(A) = 10x - x^2\n- Profit from chip B: P(B) = 20y - y^2\n\nwhere x and y are the number of units of chips A and B produced, respectively.\n\nThe company has a total production capacity of 30 units. However, due to technical limitations, the number of units of chip B cannot be more than twice the number of units of chip A.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can obtain and how many units of each type of chip should be produced to achieve it?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we need to consider the constraints given:\n\n1. Total production capacity: x + y ≤ 30\n2. Technical limitation: y ≤ 2x\n\nFirst, we need to express y in terms of x using the technical limitation constraint:\n\ny = 2x\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the total production capacity constraint:\n\nx + 2x ≤ 30\n3x ≤ 30\nx ≤ 10\n\nSo, the number of units of chip A produced (x) must be between 0 and 10. Now, we can find the total profit function P(T) by adding the profit functions of chip A and chip B:\n\nP(T) = P(A) + P(B) = (10x - x^2) + (20y - y^2)\n\nSubstitute y = 2x into the total profit function:\n\nP(T) = 10x - x^2 + 20(2x) - (2x)^2\nP(T) = 10x - x^2 + 40x - 4x^2\nP(T) = -5x^2 + 50x\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of P(T) for x in the range [0, 10]. To do this, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of P(T) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndP(T)/dx = -10x + 50\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0:\n\n-10x + 50 = 0\n10x = 50\nx = 5\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the range [0, 10] to ensure that x = 5 gives the maximum profit:\n\nP(T)(0) = -5(0)^2 + 50(0) = 0\nP(T)(5) = -5(5)^2 + 50(5) = -125 + 250 = 125\nP(T)(10) = -5(10)^2 + 50(10) = -500 + 500 = 0\n\nSince P(T)(5) > P(T)(0) and P(T)(5) > P(T)(10), the maximum profit occurs when x = 5. Now, we can find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 2x = 2(5) = 10\n\nSo, the company should produce 5 units of chip A and 10 units of chip B to achieve a maximum profit of 125."
