    "message_2": "First, let's clarify that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over union in set theory. However, we can still find the Cartesian product of A and B and the union of the resulting sets.\n\nThe Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A x B) and (A x B). Since both sets are the same, their union will be the same as the original set.\n\n(A x B) ∪ (A x B) = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}"
