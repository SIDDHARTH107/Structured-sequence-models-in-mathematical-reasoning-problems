    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 20\n-4x + 3y - 5z = -2\n6x - 5y + 4z = 11\n\nThe coefficient matrix A is:\n\n|  2   3   4 |\n| -4   3  -5 |\n|  6  -5   4 |\n\nApplying LU decomposition, we get:\n\nL = |  1    0    0  |\n    | -2    1    0  |\n    |  3   -2    1  |\n\nU = |  2    3    4  |\n    |  0    9    3  |\n    |  0    0  -10 |\n\nNow, we solve the system Ly = b, where b is the constant matrix:\n\n|  1    0    0  |  | y1 |   | 20 |\n| -2    1    0  |  | y2 | = | -2 |\n|  3   -2    1  |  | y3 |   | 11 |\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny1 = 20\ny2 = -2 - (-2 * 20) = 38\ny3 = 11 - (3 * 20) + (2 * 38) = 5\n\nSo, y = | 20 | \n         | 38 |\n         |  5 |\n\nNow, we solve the system Ux = y:\n\n|  2    3    4  |  | x1 |   | 20 |\n|  0    9    3  |  | x2 | = | 38 |\n|  0    0  -10  |  | x3 |   |  5 |\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx3 = -5 / -10 = 0.5\nx2 = (38 - 3 * 0.5) / 9 = 4\nx1 = (20 - 3 * 4 - 4 * 0.5) / 2 = 2\n\nSo, x = | 2.00 |\n         | 4.00 |\n         | 0.50 |\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2.00, y = 4.00, and z = 0.50."
