    "message_2": "To solve the system of nonlinear equations using Newton's method, we first need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let F(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)), where f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 10 and f2(x, y) = x*y - 3. The Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x   2y |\n          |  y   x  |\n\nNow, we will apply Newton's method for 3 iterations starting with the initial approximation (x0, y0) = (1, 2):\n\n1. Compute F(x0, y0) = (f1(1, 2), f2(1, 2)) = (-5, -1)\n2. Compute J(x0, y0) = | 2  4 |\n                      | 2  1 |\n3. Solve the linear system J(x0, y0) * (Δx, Δy) = -F(x0, y0) for (Δx, Δy)\n   We get (Δx, Δy) = (1.4, 1.6)\n4. Update the approximation: (x1, y1) = (x0 + Δx, y0 + Δy) = (2.4, 3.6)\n\nRepeat the process for 2 more iterations:\n\nIteration 2:\n1. F(x1, y1) = (-0.64, 0.44)\n2. J(x1, y1) = | 4.8  7.2 |\n               | 3.6  2.4 |\n3. Solve the linear system for (Δx, Δy), we get (Δx, Δy) = (0.246, -0.434)\n4. Update the approximation: (x2, y2) = (2.646, 3.166)\n\nIteration 3:\n1. F(x2, y2) = (0.018, -0.012)\n2. J(x2, y2) = | 5.292  6.332 |\n               | 3.166  2.646 |\n3. Solve the linear system for (Δx, Δy), we get (Δx, Δy) = (0.004, -0.008)\n4. Update the approximation: (x3, y3) = (2.650, 3.158)\n\nAfter 3 iterations of Newton's method, the values of x and y are approximately x = 2.650 and y = 3.158, rounded to three decimal places."
