    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to define the universal set U. Let's assume that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for this problem.\n\nNow, let's find the sets (A x B)', A', and B':\n\n1. A x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\n2. (A x B)' is the complement of A x B, which means it contains all the ordered pairs (x, y) such that x ∈ U, y ∈ U, and (x, y) ∉ A x B.\n\n(A x B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\n3.
