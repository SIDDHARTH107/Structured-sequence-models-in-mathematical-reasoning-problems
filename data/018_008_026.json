What is the size of the Cartesian product of B and A?\nDo your answers show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative?",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nThe size of the Cartesian product of A and B is the number of elements in A x B. Since there are 3 elements in A and 2 elements in B, the size of A x B is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nThe Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A, is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nThe size of the Cartesian product of B and A is the number of elements in B x A. Since there are 2 elements in B and 3 elements in A, the size of B x A is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nComparing A x B and B x A, we can see that the elements in these sets are different, even though their sizes are the same. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative, as A x B â‰  B x A."
