    "message_2": "The given Schrödinger equation is a Sturm-Liouville problem, which can be solved using various techniques. However, this specific equation is a well-known problem in quantum mechanics, known as the quantum harmonic oscillator. The solutions to this problem are given by Hermite polynomials and Gaussian functions. \n\nTo find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we first rewrite the Schrödinger equation as follows:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\psi(x) + 4\\psi(x) = (E + x^2)\\psi(x)\n$$\n\nThe eigenvalues for the quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\n$$\nE_n = (2n + 1), \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n$$\n\nThe first three eigenvalues are:\n\n$$\nE_1 = 1, \\quad E_2 = 3, \\quad E_3 = 5\n$$\n\nThe corresponding eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are given by:\n\n$$\n\\psi_n(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n n!}} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/4} e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x)\n$$\n\nwhere $H_n(x)$ are the Hermite polynomials. The first three Hermite polynomials are:\n\n$$\nH_0(x) = 1, \\quad H_1(x) = 2x, \\quad H_2(x) = 4x^2 - 2\n$$\n\nThus, the first three eigenfunctions are:\n\n$$\n\\psi_1(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/4} e^{-x^2/2}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\psi_2(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)^{1/2} 2x e^{-x^2/2}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\psi_3(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8\\pi}} (4x^2 - 2) e^{-x^2/2}\n$$\n\nSo, the first three eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors are:\n\n$$\nE_1 = 1, \\quad \\psi_1(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/4} e^{-x^2/2}\n$$\n\n$$\nE_2 = 3, \\quad \\psi_2(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)^{1/2} 2x e^{-x^2/2}\n$$\n\n$$\nE_3 = 5, \\quad \\psi_3(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8\\pi}} (4x^2 - 2) e^{-x^2/2}\n$$"
