    "message_2": "To create a Playfair key matrix using the keyword \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the keyword. In this case, the keyword \"MATHS\" has no duplicates.\n2. Create a 5x5 matrix and fill it with the keyword letters.\n3. Fill the remaining spaces in the matrix with the rest of the alphabet, excluding the letter 'J' (as it is combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher). \n\nThe resulting Playfair key matrix is:\n\nM  A  T  H  S\nB  C  D  E  F\nG  I  K  L  N\nO  P  Q  R  U\nV  W  X  Y  Z\n\nTo find the number of unique pairs of letters that can be formed in this matrix, we need to consider that each pair can be formed by selecting 2 different letters from the 25 available letters (since 'J' is not included).\n\nUsing the combination formula, we can calculate the number of unique pairs:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nWhere n = 25 (total number of letters) and k = 2 (number of letters in each pair).\n\nC(25, 2) = 25! / (2!(25-2)!) = 25! / (2!23!) = (25 * 24) / (2 * 1) = 300\n\nSo, there are 300 unique pairs of letters that can be formed in this Playfair key matrix."
