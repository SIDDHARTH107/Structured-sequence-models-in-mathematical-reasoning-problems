    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the meromorphic function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero. In this case, the numerator is $(z-1)^2$. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$(z-1)^2 = 0$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$z-1 = 0$\n\nSo, the zero of the function is at $z = 1$. Since this zero is squared, it has an order of 2.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the meromorphic function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero. In this case, the denominator is $z^3(z+2)$. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$z^3(z+2) = 0$\n\nThis equation has two factors: $z^3$ and $(z+2)$. Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\n1) $z^3 = 0$\n2) $z+2 = 0$\n\nFor the first equation, taking the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\n$z = 0$\n\nSo, there is a pole at $z = 0$. Since this pole is cubed, it has an order of 3.\n\nFor the second equation, solving for z, we get:\n\n$z = -2$\n\nSo, there is a pole at $z = -2$. Since this pole has no exponent, it has an order of 1.\n\nIn summary, the meromorphic function $f(z) = \\frac{(z-1)^2}{z^3(z+2)}$ has:\n\n1) A zero at $z = 1$ with order 2.\n2) A pole at $z = 0$ with order 3.\n3) A pole at $z = -2$ with order 1."
