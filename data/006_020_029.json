    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen household owns at least one black car, we can first find the probability that a household does not own any black cars and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a household not owning a black car is 0.6 (since 1 - 0.4 = 0.6). Since there are 2 cars in each household, the probability that both cars are not black is 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a household owns at least one black car by subtracting the probability of not owning any black cars from 1:\n\n1 - 0.36 = 0.64\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen household owns at least one black car is 0.64 or 64%."
