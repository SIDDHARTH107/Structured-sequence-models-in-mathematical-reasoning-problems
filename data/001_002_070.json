    "message_2": "To find the slope of the line that passes through the points (2, 5) and (6, 9), we can use the formula:\n\nslope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the first point (2, 5) and (x2, y2) is the second point (6, 9).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nm = (9 - 5) / (6 - 2)\nm = 4 / 4\nm = 1\n\nSo, the slope of the line that passes through the points (2, 5) and (6, 9) is 1."
