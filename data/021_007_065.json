    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nUsing Newton-Raphson method, find the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 10x - 20, correct to four decimal places, starting with a guess of x0 = 1.",
    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the given function. The function is:\n\nf(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 10x - 20\n\nThe derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 10\n\nNow, we will apply the Newton-Raphson formula:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe start with the initial guess x0 = 1:\n\nx1 = 1 - (1^3 + 2(1)^2 + 10(1) - 20) / (3(1)^2 + 4(1) + 10)\nx1 = 1 - (-7) / 17\nx1 ≈ 1.4118\n\nNow, we will repeat the process until we reach the desired accuracy (four decimal places):\n\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1)\nx2 ≈ 1.4118 - (1.4118^3 + 2(1.4118)^2 + 10(1.4118) - 20) / (3(1.4118)^2 + 4(1.4118) + 10)\nx2 ≈ 1.3683\n\nx3 = x2 - f(x2) / f'(x2)\nx3 ≈ 1.3683 - (1.3683^3 + 2(1.3683)^2 + 10(1.3683) - 20) / (3(1.3683)^2 + 4(1.3683) + 10)\nx3 ≈ 1.3681\n\nSince x2 and x3 are the same up to four decimal places, we can stop here. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 10x - 20, correct to four decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 1.3681."
