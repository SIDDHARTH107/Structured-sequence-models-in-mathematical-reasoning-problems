    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. They are:\n\n1. Cyclic group C_36\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups C_9 x C_4\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups C_3 x C_12\n4. The semi-direct product of C_9 and C_4\n\nAll of these groups have 36 elements, as their order is 36. Now let's discuss their properties:\n\n1. Cyclic group C_36:\nThis group is generated by a single element, say g, and its elements are {1, g, g^2, ..., g^35}. It is abelian, meaning that the group operation is commutative. In this group, every element has an order that divides 36.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups C_9 x C_4:\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It is also abelian, and its elements can be represented as pairs (a, b), where a is an element of C_9 and b is an element of C_4. The order of an element (a, b) in this group is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups C_3 x C_12:\nSimilar to the previous group, this group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 12. It is also abelian, and its elements can be represented as pairs (a, b), where a is an element of C_3 and b is an element of C_12. The order of an element (a, b) in this group is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b.\n\n4. The semi-direct product of C_9 and C_4:\nThis group is a non-abelian group, meaning that the group operation is not commutative. It is formed by taking the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. The elements of this group can be represented as pairs (a, b), where a is an element of C_9 and b is an element of C_4. The group operation is more complicated than in the direct product case, as it involves a non-trivial action of one group on the other.\n\nIn summary, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36, with three of them being abelian and one being non-abelian. Each group has 36 elements, and their properties are determined by the structure of the group and the group operation."
