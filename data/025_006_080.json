    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(X, O_X), we can use the fact that X is a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space. In particular, we can use the following result:\n\nFor a smooth cubic surface X in projective 3-space, we have H^1(X, O_X) = 0.\n\nThis result can be proven using the Serre duality theorem and the fact that the canonical bundle of a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space is trivial (i.e., isomorphic to the structure sheaf O_X).\n\nSo, in our case, the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(X, O_X) is 0."
