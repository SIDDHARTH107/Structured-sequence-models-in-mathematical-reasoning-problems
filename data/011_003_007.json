    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's Triangle, we need to find the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students (20 in this case) and k is the number of students we want to choose (5 in this case).\n\nUsing Pascal's Triangle, we can find the value of C(20, 5) by looking at the 21st row (since Pascal's Triangle starts with row 0) and the 6th element (since the first element in each row is the 0th element).\n\nHere are the first 21 rows of Pascal's Triangle:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n```\n...\n\nThe 21st row of Pascal's Triangle is:\n\n1 20 190 1140 4845 15504 38760 77520 125970 167960 184756 167960 125970 77520 38760 15504 4845 1140 190 20 1\n\nThe 6th element in this row is 15504.\n\nSo, there are 15,504 ways to choose 5 students from a class of 20 to form a group for a class project."
