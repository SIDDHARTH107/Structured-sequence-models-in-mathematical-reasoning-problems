    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we need to find the angle opposite the longest side, which is 9 cm in this case. We will use the Law of Cosines to find the angle.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides respectively:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = 5 cm, b = 8 cm, and c = 9 cm. We want to find the angle C.\n\n9² = 5² + 8² - 2 * 5 * 8 * cos(C)\n\n81 = 25 + 64 - 80 * cos(C)\n\n81 = 89 - 80 * cos(C)\n\nNow, isolate cos(C):\n\n80 * cos(C) = 89 - 81\n\n80 * cos(C) = 8\n\ncos(C) = 8 / 80\n\ncos(C) = 1 / 10\n\nNow, to find the angle C, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(1 / 10)\n\nC ≈ 84.26°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 84.26°."
