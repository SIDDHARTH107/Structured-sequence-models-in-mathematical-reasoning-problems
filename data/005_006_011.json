    "message_1": "A manufacturer of shirts claims that their shirts have an average sleeve length of 25 inches with a standard deviation of 2 inches. A sample of 36 shirts is taken. What is the probability that the average sleeve length in the sample is less than 24.5 inches?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the z-score formula for a sample mean:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nμ = 25 inches (the claimed average sleeve length)\nσ = 2 inches (the standard deviation)\nn = 36 (the sample size)\nx̄ = 24.5 inches (the sample mean we want to find the probability for)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the z-score formula:\n\nz = (24.5 - 25) / (2 / √36)\nz = (-0.5) / (2 / 6)\nz = (-0.5) / (1/3)\nz = -1.5\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in z-score function. The probability of a z-score being less than -1.5 is approximately 0.0668 or 6.68%. \n\nSo, there is a 6.68% chance that the average sleeve length in the sample is less than 24.5 inches."
