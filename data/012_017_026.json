    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 6 vertices labeled as A, B, C, D, E and F, and the following edges: AB, AC, AD, BE, BF, CE, CF, DE, and DF. Determine whether this graph contains a perfect matching or not. If it does have a perfect matching, write down the edges that form it. If it does not have a perfect matching, explain why.",
    "message_2": "This graph contains a perfect matching. A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all the vertices in the graph such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching.\n\nOne possible perfect matching for this graph is:\n\nAB, CE, DF\n\nAnother possible perfect matching is:\n\nAC, BE, DF\n\nIn both cases, all 6 vertices are covered, and each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching."
