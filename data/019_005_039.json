    "message_1": "Here is a prompt for a math student in epistemic logic:\n\nConsider two individuals, A and B, who each know that at least one of them is wearing a red shirt. However, neither of them knows for certain whether or not they themselves are wearing a red shirt. If they are both wearing red shirts, they will both know this fact. Otherwise, neither will know for sure if they are wearing a red shirt or not. \n\nAssuming that both individuals are perfectly rational and know that the other is as well, answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the probability that both individuals are wearing red shirts?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible scenarios for A and B wearing red shirts. We will use \"R\" to represent a red shirt and \"N\" to represent a non-red shirt. There are four possible scenarios:\n\n1. A is wearing a red shirt (R), and B is wearing a red shirt (R).\n2. A is wearing a red shirt (R), and B is wearing a non-red shirt (N).\n3. A is wearing a non-red shirt (N), and B is wearing a red shirt (R).\n4. A is wearing a non-red shirt (N), and B is wearing a non-red shirt (N).\n\nHowever, we know that at least one of them is wearing a red shirt, so we can eliminate scenario 4. This leaves us with three possible scenarios:\n\n1. A is wearing a red shirt (R), and B is wearing a red shirt (R).\n2. A is wearing a red shirt (R), and B is wearing a non-red shirt (N).\n3. A is wearing a non-red shirt (N), and B is wearing a red shirt (R).\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that both individuals are wearing red shirts, which corresponds to scenario 1. Since there are three possible scenarios and each is equally likely, the probability that both individuals are wearing red shirts is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (33.33%)."
