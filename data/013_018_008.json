    "message_1": "A buyer wants to buy a used car from a seller, but the buyer is not sure about the quality of the car. The buyer assigns a probability of 0.4 to the car being a lemon (low quality) and a probability of 0.6 to the car being a good one. The seller knows if the car is a lemon or a good one. The seller values the car at $8000 if it is good and $3000 if it is a lemon. The seller would like to sell the car to the buyer at either $6000 or $5000. If the buyer offers $6000, the seller may accept the offer whether the car is a lemon or good one. If the buyer offers $5000, the seller will refuse the offer if the car is good but will accept it if the car is a lemon. What offer should the buyer make to signal that the car is probably not a lemon?",
    "message_2": "To determine which offer the buyer should make to signal that the car is probably not a lemon, we can calculate the expected value of the car for each offer.\n\n1. If the buyer offers $6000:\n- If the car is a lemon (probability 0.4), the buyer pays $6000 for a car worth $3000, resulting in a loss of $3000.\n- If the car is a good one (probability 0.6), the buyer pays $6000 for a car worth $8000, resulting in a gain of $2000.\n\nExpected value for the buyer if they offer $6000 = (0.4 * -$3000) + (0.6 * $2000) = -$1200 + $1200 = $0\n\n2. If the buyer offers $5000:\n- If the car is a lemon (probability 1, since the seller will only accept this offer if the car is a lemon), the buyer pays $5000 for a car worth $3000, resulting in a loss of $2000.\n\nExpected value for the buyer if they offer $5000 = -$2000\n\nComparing the expected values, the buyer should make an offer of $6000 to signal that the car is probably not a lemon, as the expected value is higher ($0) compared to the expected value of offering $5000 (-$2000)."
