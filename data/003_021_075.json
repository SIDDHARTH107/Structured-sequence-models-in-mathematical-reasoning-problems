    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product formula is:\n\nv1 • v2 = |v1| |v2| cos(θ)\n\nwhere v1 • v2 is the dot product of the two vectors, |v1| and |v2| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nv1 • v2 = (-3)(6) + (4)(8) = -18 + 32 = 14\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|v1| = √((-3)^2 + (4)^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v2| = √((6)^2 + (8)^2) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n14 = (5)(10)cos(θ)\n14 = 50cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\ncos(θ) = 14/50 = 7/25\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 7/25:\n\nθ = arccos(7/25)\n\nθ ≈ 73.4°\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 73.4°."
