    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we first find the prime factorization of 40, which is 2^3 * 5. Now, we use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is given by the product of the number of partitions of each prime power in the prime factorization.\n\nThe number of partitions of 2^3 is 3, and the number of partitions of 5 is 1. Therefore, the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40 is 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nThe three non-isomorphic groups of order 40 are:\n\n1. Cyclic group C_40: This group has elements {0, 1, 2, ..., 39} with addition modulo 40 as the group operation. The group table would be a 40x40 table with rows and columns labeled by the elements of the group, and the entry in row i and column j would be (i + j) mod 40.\n\n2. Direct product of C_8 and C_5, denoted C_8 × C_5: This group has elements of the form (a, b), where a is an element of C_8 and b is an element of C_5. The group operation is component-wise addition modulo the order of each component group. The group table would be a 40x40 table with rows and columns labeled by the elements of the group, and the entry in row (i, j) and column (k, l) would be ((i + k) mod 8, (j + l) mod 5).\n\n3. Semidirect product of C_8 and C_5, denoted C_8 ⋊ C_5: This group has elements of the form (a, b), where a is an element of C_8 and b is an element of C_5. The group operation is defined as (a, b) * (c, d) = (a + φ(b)(c), b + d), where φ is a non-trivial homomorphism from C_5 to Aut(C_8). The group table would be a 40x40 table with rows and columns labeled by the elements of the group, and the entry in row (i, j) and column (k, l) would be ((i + φ(j)(k)) mod 8, (j + l) mod 5).\n\nIt is not practical to list down the complete group tables for each of these groups here, as each table would have 40 rows and 40 columns, resulting in a total of 1600 entries. However, the descriptions provided above should give you a clear understanding of how to construct the group tables for each of these non-isomorphic groups of order 40."
