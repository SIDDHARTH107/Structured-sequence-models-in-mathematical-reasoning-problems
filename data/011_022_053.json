    "message_2": "To maximize the weight of books the student can carry to the library, we need to find the combination of books that adds up to 10 kg or as close to 10 kg as possible without exceeding it. \n\nHere are the possible combinations:\n\n1. 2 kg + 3 kg = 5 kg\n2. 2 kg + 5 kg = 7 kg\n3. 2 kg + 6 kg = 8 kg\n4. 2 kg + 7 kg = 9 kg\n5. 3 kg + 5 kg = 8 kg\n6. 3 kg + 6 kg = 9 kg\n7. 3 kg + 7 kg = 10 kg\n8. 5 kg + 6 kg = 11 kg (exceeds 10 kg)\n9. 5 kg + 7 kg = 12 kg (exceeds 10 kg)\n10. 6 kg + 7 kg = 13 kg (exceeds 10 kg)\n\nThe combination that maximizes the weight of books the student can carry to the library is the 3 kg book and the 7 kg book, which together weigh 10 kg."
