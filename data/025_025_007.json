    "message_1": "Let A be a finitely generated, connected graded algebra over a field k with a finite number of variables. Suppose the Hilbert series of A is\n\n$h_A(t) = \\frac{1 + 3t^2}{(1-t)^3}$\n\nWhat is the degree of the Hilbert polynomial of A?",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of the Hilbert polynomial of A, we first need to find the Hilbert polynomial itself. The Hilbert series is given by:\n\n$h_A(t) = \\frac{1 + 3t^2}{(1-t)^3}$\n\nWe can rewrite the denominator as a binomial expansion using the negative binomial theorem:\n\n$(1-t)^{-3} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} {-3 \\choose n} (-t)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-3)(-4)...(-3-n+1)}{n!} t^n$\n\nNow, we multiply the numerator with the binomial expansion:\n\n$h_A(t) = (1 + 3t^2) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-3)(-4)...(-3-n+1)}{n!} t^n$\n\n$h_A(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{(-3)(-4)...(-3-n+1)}{n!} + 3\\frac{(-3)(-4)...(-3-n+1)}{(n-2)!} \\right] t^n$\n\nNow, we need to find the Hilbert polynomial, which is the polynomial part of the Hilbert series. We can see that the polynomial part will have degree 2, as the terms with higher powers of t will have a factorial in the denominator, making them rational functions with a pole at t=1.\n\nSo, the degree of the Hilbert polynomial of A is 2."
