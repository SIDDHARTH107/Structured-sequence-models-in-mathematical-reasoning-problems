Calculate the second De Rham cohomology group $H^2(\\Sigma)$ of $\\Sigma$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{R}$, i.e., determine the dimension of the space of closed and exact 2-forms on $\\Sigma$ up to equivalence.",
    "message_2": "The surface $\\Sigma$ given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4$ is a sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin. Since the sphere is a compact, connected, and orientable 2-dimensional manifold, we can use the Poincaré duality theorem to compute its De Rham cohomology groups. The Poincaré duality theorem states that for a compact, connected, and orientable manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, the De Rham cohomology groups satisfy $H^k(M) \\cong H^{n-k}(M)$ for all $0 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nIn our case, $n = 2$, so we have $H^2(\\Sigma) \\cong H^0(\\Sigma)$. The 0th De Rham cohomology group $H^0(\\Sigma)$ is the space of constant functions on $\\Sigma$, which is 1-dimensional. Therefore, the second De Rham cohomology group $H^2(\\Sigma)$ is also 1-dimensional.\n\nTo see this more explicitly, we can compute the exterior derivative of the given 1-form $\\omega$ to obtain a 2-form:\n\n$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right) dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\right) dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = 3 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$.\n\nSince $d\\omega$ is a non-zero multiple of the volume form on $\\Sigma$, it is a closed and exact 2-form on $\\Sigma$. Thus, the dimension of the space of closed and exact 2-forms on $\\Sigma$ up to equivalence is 1, which agrees with our previous computation of $H^2(\\Sigma)$."
