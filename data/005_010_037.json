    "message_2": "To find the probability that the diameter of a randomly selected bolt is between 0.75 cm and 0.85 cm, we need to calculate the z-scores for these values and then find the area under the standard normal distribution curve between these z-scores.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-scores for 0.75 cm and 0.85 cm:\n\nz1 = (0.75 - 0.8) / 0.03 = -0.05 / 0.03 = -1.67 (approximately)\nz2 = (0.85 - 0.8) / 0.03 = 0.05 / 0.03 = 1.67 (approximately)\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the standard normal distribution curve between z1 and z2. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in function for this purpose.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of z1 = -1.67 is approximately 0.0475, and the area to the left of z2 = 1.67 is approximately 0.9525.\n\nThe area between z1 and z2 is the difference between these two areas:\n\nArea between z1 and z2 = 0.9525 - 0.0475 = 0.905\n\nSo, the probability that the diameter of a randomly selected bolt is between 0.75 cm and 0.85 cm is approximately 0.905 or 90.5%."
