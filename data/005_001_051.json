    "message_1": "A coffee shop owner claims that the average time it takes for the barista to make a cup of coffee is less than 2 minutes. In order to test this claim, a random sample of 36 coffee cups was selected and it was found that the mean time taken to make a cup of coffee was 1.76 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.35 minutes. Using a significance level of 0.05, can we reject the owner's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the owner's claim, we will conduct a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average time it takes to make a cup of coffee is equal to or greater than 2 minutes, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average time is less than 2 minutes.\n\nH0: μ ≥ 2\nH1: μ < 2\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 36\nSample mean (x̄) = 1.76 minutes\nSample standard deviation (s) = 0.35 minutes\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is large enough (n > 30), we can use the t-distribution to approximate the normal distribution. First, we need to calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (1.76 - 2) / (0.35 / √36)\nt = (-0.24) / (0.35 / 6)\nt = -0.24 / 0.058333\nt ≈ -4.116\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 35 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.69.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-4.116) is less than the critical t-value (-1.69), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Therefore, we have enough evidence to support the owner's claim that the average time it takes for the barista to make a cup of coffee is less than 2 minutes at the 0.05 significance level."
