    "message_2": "To determine the stability of a system using Fourier transform analysis, we need to check the poles of the transfer function G(s). A system is stable if all the poles have negative real parts. \n\nThe transfer function G(s) is given by:\n\nG(s) = (s + 2) / (s^2 + 4s + 13)\n\nFirst, we need to find the poles of G(s) by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 13 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots (poles) using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4 * 1 * 13)) / (2 * 1)\ns = (-4 ± √(16 - 52)) / 2\ns = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\ns = -2 ± j√36\ns = -2 ± 6j\n\nBoth poles have negative real parts (-2), which means the system is stable."
