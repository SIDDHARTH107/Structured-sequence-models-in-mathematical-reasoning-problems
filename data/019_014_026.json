    "message_2": "In higher-order logic, the formula (∀Y. X<Y) → (∃Z. Z<X) can be interpreted as follows:\n\nIf X is smaller than every Y, then there exists a Z that is smaller than X.\n\nTo find a value for X that satisfies this formula, we need to find a value that is smaller than all other values. In the context of real numbers, there is no smallest real number, as there are infinitely many negative numbers. However, if we consider the set of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, ...), the smallest natural number is 0.\n\nSo, if we let X = 0, the formula becomes:\n\n(∀Y. 0<Y) → (∃Z. Z<0)\n\nSince 0 is smaller than every positive natural number Y, the left side of the implication is true. However, there is no natural number Z that is smaller than 0, so the right side of the implication is false. In this case, the implication is not satisfied.\n\nIf we consider the set of integers, there is no smallest integer, as there are infinitely many negative integers. Therefore, there is no specific value for X that would satisfy the formula in the context of integers or real numbers."
