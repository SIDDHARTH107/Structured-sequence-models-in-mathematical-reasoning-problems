    "message_1": "The auction of a painting was won by a bidder who offered $5000. The second highest bid was $4500. If the auction followed the first-price sealed-bid auction method, what was the minimum value the winning bidder could have bid to win?",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins and pays the amount they bid. To win the auction, the winning bidder needed to bid just above the second highest bid. Therefore, the minimum value the winning bidder could have bid to win is $4500 + a small increment (e.g., $0.01). So, the minimum bid would be $4500.01."
