    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation cos(x) = 0.5, we need to find the angles x in the interval [0, 2π] for which the cosine function has a value of 0.5.\n\nThere are two angles in this interval that satisfy the equation:\n\n1. x = π/3 (or 60°): cos(π/3) = 0.5\n2. x = 5π/3 (or 300°): cos(5π/3) = 0.5\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given interval are x = π/3 and x = 5π/3."
