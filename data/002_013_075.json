    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base that measures 6 meters by 8 meters and a height of 9 meters. What is the volume of this pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nThe base of the pyramid is a rectangle with dimensions 6 meters by 8 meters, so the base area is:\n\nBase_area = length * width = 6 meters * 8 meters = 48 square meters\n\nNow we can find the volume:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 48 square meters * 9 meters = 16 square meters * 9 meters = 144 cubic meters\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 144 cubic meters."
