    "message_1": "Suppose a store sells apples for $0.75 each and oranges for $1.25 each. A customer purchases a total of 10 fruits and spends $9.50. How many of each kind of fruit did the customer buy? Using a system of linear equations, solve for the number of apples and oranges purchased.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of apples and y be the number of oranges. We can set up the following system of linear equations:\n\n0.75x + 1.25y = 9.50 (Total cost equation)\nx + y = 10 (Total number of fruits equation)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. In this case, we will use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 10 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the first equation:\n\n0.75x + 1.25(10 - x) = 9.50\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n0.75x + 12.50 - 1.25x = 9.50\n-0.50x = -3\nx = 6\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:\n\ny = 10 - x\ny = 10 - 6\ny = 4\n\nSo, the customer bought 6 apples and 4 oranges."
