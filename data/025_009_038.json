    "message_1": "Given a moduli space $\\overline{M}_{g,n}$ of stable algebraic curves of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points, we want to find the dimension of the tangent space at a general point. \n\nFor $g=2$ and $n=4$, what is the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{2,4}$ at a general point?",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{2,4}$ at a general point, we can use the formula for the dimension of the moduli space of stable curves:\n\n$$\\dim(\\overline{M}_{g,n}) = 3g - 3 + n$$\n\nIn this case, we have $g = 2$ and $n = 4$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$\\dim(\\overline{M}_{2,4}) = 3(2) - 3 + 4 = 6 - 3 + 4 = 7$$\n\nSo the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{2,4}$ at a general point is 7."
