The distances (in miles) between the cities are as follows:\n\nCity 1 to City 2: 10 miles\nCity 1 to City 3: 20 miles\nCity 1 to City 4: 15 miles\nCity 2 to City 3: 25 miles\nCity 2 to City 4: 30 miles\nCity 3 to City 4: 12 miles\nCity 3 to City 5: 18 miles\nCity 4 to City 5: 22 miles\nCity 5 to City 6: 16 miles\nCity 5 to City 7: 26 miles\nCity 5 to City 8: 15 miles\nCity 6 to City 7: 12 miles\nCity 6 to City 8: 17 miles\nCity 7 to City 8: 28 miles\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance the traveling salesman can travel to visit all 8 cities exactly once and return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance the traveling salesman can travel to visit all 8 cities exactly once and return to the starting city, we can use the brute force method to find all possible routes and calculate their distances. However, this method is computationally expensive, especially for larger numbers of cities. Alternatively, we can use a heuristic approach, such as the nearest neighbor algorithm, to find a good approximation of the shortest route.\n\nUsing the nearest neighbor algorithm, we start at City 1 and visit the nearest unvisited city until all cities have been visited. Then, we return to the starting city. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Start at City 1\n2. Go to City 2 (10 miles)\n3. Go to City 4 (30 miles)\n4. Go to City 3 (12 miles)\n5. Go to City 5 (18 miles)\n6. Go to City 8 (15 miles)\n7. Go to City 6 (17 miles)\n8. Go to City 7 (12 miles)\n9. Return to City 1 (20 miles)\n\nThe total distance traveled is 10 + 30 + 12 + 18 + 15 + 17 + 12 + 20 = 134 miles.\n\nPlease note that the nearest neighbor algorithm does not guarantee the optimal solution, but it provides a good approximation. The actual shortest route might be slightly different."
