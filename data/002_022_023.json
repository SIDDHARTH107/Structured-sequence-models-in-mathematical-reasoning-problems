    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius²) * (2π * major_radius)\n\nGiven that the major radius (R) is 6 cm and the minor radius (r) is 3 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * 3²) * (2π * 6)\n\nVolume = (π * 9) * (12π)\n\nVolume = 108π²\n\nThe volume of the torus is 108π² cubic centimeters."
