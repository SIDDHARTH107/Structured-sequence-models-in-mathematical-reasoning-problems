    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to determine how many of these outcomes meet that condition. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes:\n\nP(rolling a number > 3) = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total possible outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2 or 50%."
