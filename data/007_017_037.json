    "message_2": "A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number. To find the first twin prime greater than 50, we need to find a prime number p such that both p and p+2 are prime.\n\nLet's start checking prime numbers greater than 50:\n\n53 is prime, but 53 + 2 = 55 is not prime (divisible by 5).\n\n59 is prime, and 59 + 2 = 61 is also prime.\n\nSo, the first twin prime greater than 50 is 59 and its twin is 61."
