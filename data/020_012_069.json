    "message_1": "A chemical factory produces two types of fertilizers, type A and type B. The cost per ton of producing fertilizer A is $200 and for fertilizer B is $300. The factory can produce a maximum of 200 tons per day. The profit obtained by selling a ton of fertilizer A is $500 and for fertilizer B, it is $600. The maximum demand for fertilizer A is 80 tons per day and for B it is 120 tons per day. How much of each fertilizer should be produced to maximize the profit for the factory?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of tons of fertilizer A produced and y be the number of tons of fertilizer B produced.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (total production capacity)\n2. x ≤ 80 (maximum demand for fertilizer A)\n3. y ≤ 120 (maximum demand for fertilizer B)\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\n\nP(x, y) = 500x + 600y - 200x - 300y = 300x + 300y\n\nSince the profit per ton is the same for both fertilizers ($300), we should focus on producing as much as possible within the constraints. \n\nFirst, let's check if we can produce the maximum demand for both fertilizers:\n\n80 + 120 = 200\n\nSince the sum of the maximum demand for both fertilizers is equal to the total production capacity, the factory should produce 80 tons of fertilizer A and 120 tons of fertilizer B to maximize the profit.\n\nThe maximum profit will be:\n\nP(80, 120) = 300(80) + 300(120) = 24,000 + 36,000 = $60,000 per day."
