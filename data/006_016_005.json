    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces 1000 smartphones per day. The probability of a defect in the battery of a smartphone being produced is 0.02. What is the likelihood that at least 20 smartphones produced in a day will have a defective battery?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective smartphones\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective smartphones from n total smartphones, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of smartphones produced (1000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective smartphones (we want to find the probability of having at least 20 defective smartphones)\n- p is the probability of a smartphone having a defective battery (0.02 in this case)\n\nSince we want to find the likelihood of having at least 20 defective smartphones, we need to calculate the probability of having 20, 21, 22, ..., 1000 defective smartphones and sum these probabilities. However, it's easier to find the probability of having less than 20 defective smartphones (0 to 19) and then subtract this probability from 1.\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\n\nP(X < 20) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)\n\nAnd then find:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20)\n\nLet's calculate P(X < 20):\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\n= Σ [C(1000, k) * (0.02)^k * (1-0.02)^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can use a calculator or software to compute this sum:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.9983\n\nFinally, we find the probability of having at least 20 defective smartphones:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20)\n= 1 - 0.9983\n≈ 0.0017\n\nSo, the likelihood of having at least 20 smartphones with a defective battery produced in a day is approximately 0.0017 or 0.17%."
