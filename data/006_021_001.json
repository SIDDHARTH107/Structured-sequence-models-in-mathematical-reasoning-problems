    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one region will flood, we can first find the probability that none of the regions will flood and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single region will not flood is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\n\nSince there are 4 different regions, the probability that none of them will flood is (0.75)^4 = 0.3164 (rounded to 4 decimal places).\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one region will flood, we subtract the probability that none will flood from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3164 = 0.6836\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 4 regions will flood in the upcoming season is approximately 0.6836 or 68.36%."
