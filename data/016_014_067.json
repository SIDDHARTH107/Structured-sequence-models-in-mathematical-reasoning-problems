    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a type of fractal that is generated through an iterative process. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases. The formula to calculate the length of the Lévy C curve after n iterations is:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (sqrt(2))^n\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 5 iterations. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2))^5\n\nLength ≈ 1 * 4.47214\n\nLength ≈ 4.47214 units\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after 5 iterations is approximately 4.47214 units."
