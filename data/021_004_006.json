    "message_2": "To approximate the first and second derivatives of f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 using the forward difference formula, we'll first calculate f'(x) and f''(x) using the forward difference formula with a step size of h = 0.1.\n\nFor the first derivative, f'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x))/h, where h = 0.1.\n\nLet's calculate f'(1.5):\nf(1.5) = 2(1.5)^2 - 5(1.5) + 3 = 2(2.25) - 7.5 + 3 = 4.5 - 7.5 + 3 = 0\nf(1.5 + 0.1) = 2(1.6)^2 - 5(1.6) + 3 = 2(2.56) - 8 + 3 = 5.12 - 8 + 3 = 0.12\n\nNow, we can approximate f'(1.5) using the forward difference formula:\nf'(1.5) ≈ (f(1.5 + 0.1) - f(1.5))/0.1 = (0.12 - 0)/0.1 = 1.2\n\nFor the second derivative, f''(x) ≈ (f'(x + h) - f'(x))/h, where h = 0.1.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate f'(1.6):\nf(1.6 + 0.1) = 2(1.7)^2 - 5(1.7) + 3 = 2(2.89) - 8.5 + 3 = 5.78 - 8.5 + 3 = 0.28\nf'(1.6) ≈ (f(1.6 + 0.1) - f(1.6))/0.1 = (0.28 - 0.12)/0.1 = 1.6\n\nNow, we can approximate f''(1.5) using the forward difference formula:\nf''(1.5) ≈ (f'(1.5 + 0.1) - f'(1.5))/0.1 = (1.6 - 1.2)/0.1 = 4\n\nSo, the approximate values for f'(1.5) and f''(1.5) using the forward difference formula with a step size of h = 0.1 are 1.2 and 4, respectively."
