Alice chooses a secret number a = 6, and Bob chooses a secret number b = 3. Calculate the shared secret key that they can use for secure communication.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p\n   A = 2^6 mod 11\n   A = 64 mod 11\n   A = 9\n\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p\n   B = 2^3 mod 11\n   B = 8 mod 11\n   B = 8\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p\n   K_A = 8^6 mod 11\n   K_A = 262144 mod 11\n   K_A = 3\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p\n   K_B = 9^3 mod 11\n   K_B = 729 mod 11\n   K_B = 3\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, the shared secret key is 3. Alice and Bob can now use this key for secure communication."
