    "message_2": "The five non-abelian groups of order 24 are:\n\n1. The symmetric group S4\n2. The dihedral group D12\n3. The dicyclic group Q24\n4. The semidirect product Z4 ⋊ Z6\n5. The semidirect product Z2 ⋊ Z12\n\nTo prove that any group of order 24 is isomorphic to one of these five groups, the cyclic group C24, or the alternating group A5, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 24. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G (denoted n2) divides 3 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n2 can be either 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G (denoted n3) divides 8 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n2 = 1 and n3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P3 of order 3. Since both are unique, they are normal in G. The intersection of P2 and P3 is trivial, so their product P2P3 has order 24. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product P2 × P3. Since P2 is a group of order 8, it can be either Z8 or Z2 × Z4. If P2 is Z8, then G is isomorphic to C24. If P2 is Z2 × Z4, then G is isomorphic to Z2 ⋊ Z12.\n\nCase 2: n2 = 3 and n3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P3 of order 3, which is normal in G. The group G/P3 has order 8, so it can be either Z8, Z2 × Z4, or Q8 (the quaternion group). If G/P3 is Z8 or Z2 × Z4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z4 ⋊ Z6. If G/P3 is Q8, then G is isomorphic to the dicyclic group Q24.\n\nCase 3: n2 = 1 and n3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P2 of order 8, which is normal in G. The group G/P2 has order 3, so G is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z8 ⋊ Z3. However, this is not possible, as there is no nontrivial homomorphism from Z3 to the automorphism group of Z8.\n\nCase 4: n2 = 3 and n3 = 4\nIn this case, G has no normal Sylow subgroups. The group G must be isomorphic to either the symmetric group S4 or the dihedral group D12.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 24 is isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups (S4, D12, Q24, Z4 ⋊ Z6, Z2 ⋊ Z12), the cyclic group C24, or the alternating group A5. Note that A5 is not of order 24, so it should not be included in the list of possible isomorphic groups."
