    "message_1": "A digital signature algorithm generates a public key and a private key pair. Suppose you want to use the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) algorithm to sign a document with a 1024 bit private key. How many possible private keys are there for this algorithm?",
    "message_2": "A 1024-bit private key means that the key is represented by a sequence of 1024 binary digits (bits), where each bit can be either 0 or 1. To find the total number of possible private keys, you need to calculate the number of combinations of these bits.\n\nSince each bit has 2 possible values (0 or 1), there are 2^1024 possible combinations of 1024 bits. Therefore, there are 2^1024 possible private keys for a 1024-bit DSS algorithm."
