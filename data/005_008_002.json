    "message_2": "To calculate the 3-day moving average, we will take the average of every three consecutive days in the given data. Here's how it's done:\n\n1. (15 + 16 + 18) / 3 = 49 / 3 = 16.33\n2. (16 + 18 + 20) / 3 = 54 / 3 = 18\n3. (18 + 20 + 22) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20\n4. (20 + 22 + 21) / 3 = 63 / 3 = 21\n5. (22 + 21 + 23) / 3 = 66 / 3 = 22\n6. (21 + 23 + 25) / 3 = 69 / 3 = 23\n7. (23 + 25 + 24) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24\n8. (25 + 24 + 26) / 3 = 75 / 3 = 25\n9. (24 + 26 + 27) / 3 = 77 / 3 = 25.67\n10. (26 + 27 + 29) / 3 = 82 / 3 = 27.33\n11. (27 + 29 + 31) / 3 = 87 / 3 = 29\n12. (29 + 31 + 33) / 3 = 93 / 3 = 31\n\nNow we have the 3-day moving averages for days 3 to 14. To predict the stock price for the 15th day, we will use the moving average of the last three days (days 12, 13, and 14).\n\nPredicted stock price for the 15th day = (27.33 + 29 + 31) / 3 = 87.33 / 3 = 29.11\n\nSo, the predicted stock price for the 15th day is $29.11."
