    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35 = 5^1 * 7^1. By the Sylow theorems, we know that:\n\n1. The number of 5-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_5, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 = 1.\n2. The number of 7-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_7, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 7. Thus, n_7 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup. Since n_5 = n_7 = 1, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G. Moreover, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, which are both prime numbers.\n\nNow, consider the product of elements from P and Q. Let p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Then, since P and Q are normal subgroups, we have:\n\npq = qp\n\nThis implies that the elements of P and Q commute with each other. Therefore, we can form a subgroup H generated by the elements of P and Q:\n\nH = ⟨p, q⟩\n\nSince the elements of P and Q commute, the order of H is given by:\n\n|H| = |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G and |H| = |G|, we have H = G. Thus, G is generated by the elements of P and Q.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIn this case, there exists an element g ∈ G such that G = ⟨g⟩. The order of g is 35, and G is a cyclic group of order 35.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIn this case, G is generated by the elements of P and Q, but there is no single element that generates the entire group. Since P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively, we can write G as the direct product of P and Q:\n\nG ≅ P × Q\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 35, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
