Each machine can only be assigned to one task at a time. What is the optimal schedule for completing all tasks in the minimum amount of time?\n\n| Task | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 |\n|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1    | 10        | 12        | 8         |\n| 2    | 15        | 10        | 11        |\n| 3    | 12        | 14        | 9         |\n| 4    | 9         | 16        | 10        |",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal schedule for completing all tasks in the minimum amount of time, we need to assign each task to the machine that can complete it the fastest. We can do this by finding the minimum time for each task and then assigning the tasks to the machines accordingly.\n\nTask 1: The minimum time is 8 on Machine 3.\nTask 2: The minimum time is 10 on Machine 2.\nTask 3: The minimum time is 9 on Machine 3.\nTask 4: The minimum time is 9 on Machine 1.\n\nSince Machine 3 has the minimum time for both Task 1 and Task 3, we need to choose the task with the overall minimum time for Machine 3. Task 1 has the overall minimum time of 8, so we assign Task 1 to Machine 3.\n\nNow we have the following assignments:\nTask 1: Machine 3 (8)\nTask 2: Machine 2 (10)\nTask 4: Machine 1 (9)\n\nSince Task 3 has not been assigned yet, we need to find the next fastest machine for Task 3. The next fastest machine for Task 3 is Machine 1 with a time of 12.\n\nSo the optimal schedule is:\nTask 1: Machine 3 (8)\nTask 2: Machine 2 (10)\nTask 3: Machine 1 (12)\nTask 4: Wait for Machine 1 to finish Task 3, then use Machine 1 (9)\n\nThe total time to complete all tasks is 12 (Task 3 on Machine 1) + 9 (Task 4 on Machine 1) = 21 minutes."
