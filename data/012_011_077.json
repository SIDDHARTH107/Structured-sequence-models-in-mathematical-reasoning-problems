    "message_2": "Since we don't have the specific graph, we cannot identify the cut vertices and bridges directly. However, I can explain the process of finding them in a general graph.\n\nA cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In other words, it is a vertex that connects two or more subgraphs. To find cut vertices, you can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal of the graph, assigning a discovery time and a low value to each vertex.\n2. The low value of a vertex is the smallest discovery time of all vertices reachable from it, including itself.\n3. A vertex is a cut vertex if it is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, or if it is not the root and has a child whose low value is greater than or equal to the discovery time of the vertex.\n\nA bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. To find bridges, you can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal of the graph, assigning a discovery time and a low value to each vertex.\n2. The low value of a vertex is the smallest discovery time of all vertices reachable from it, including itself.\n3. An edge (u, v) is a bridge if the low value of vertex v is greater than the discovery time of vertex u.\n\nBy applying these algorithms to the given graph, you can identify the cut vertices and bridges in the graph."
