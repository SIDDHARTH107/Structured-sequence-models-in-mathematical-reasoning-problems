    "message_2": "To classify the groups of order 36, we first note that 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of this order.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nWe will now analyze the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3. Both are normal in the group G, and G = P_2 * P_3. Since |P_2| = 4 and |P_3| = 9, we have P_2 isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group), and P_3 isomorphic to C9. The only possibility for G is the direct product C4 × C9, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C36.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique normal 2-Sylow subgroup P_2, but four 3-Sylow subgroups. Since P_2 is normal, we can form the semidirect product P_3 ⋊ P_2. There are two possibilities for P_2 (C4 or V4), and for each possibility, there are two possible actions of P_2 on P_3 (trivial and non-trivial). This gives us four non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n3. n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique normal 3-Sylow subgroup P_3, but nine 2-Sylow subgroups. Since P_3 is normal, we can form the semidirect product P_2 ⋊ P_3. There are two possibilities for P_2 (C4 or V4), and for each possibility, there are two possible actions of P_3 on P_2 (trivial and non-trivial). This gives us four non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n4. n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there are no normal Sylow subgroups, so we cannot form a semidirect product. However, we can form the direct product of the alternating group A4 and the cyclic group C3, which is a non-abelian group of order 36.\n\nIn total, we have found 1 abelian group (C36), 1 non-abelian group (A4 × C3), and 9 other non-abelian groups (4 from case 2, 4 from case 3, and 1 from case 4). Thus, every group of order 36 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of these nine non-abelian groups."
