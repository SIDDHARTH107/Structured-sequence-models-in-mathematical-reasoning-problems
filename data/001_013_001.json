    "message_2": "To solve the given radical equation √(x+5) - √(x-3) = 2, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate one of the square roots.\nAdd √(x-3) to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(x+5) = √(x-3) + 2\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(x+5))^2 = (√(x-3) + 2)^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + 5 = (x-3) + 4√(x-3) + 4\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation and isolate the remaining square root.\nSubtract x and 5 from both sides:\n\n0 = -8 + 4√(x-3)\n\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n\n8 = 4√(x-3)\n\nStep 4: Isolate the square root.\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n2 = √(x-3)\n\nStep 5: Square both sides again to eliminate the square root.\n2^2 = (√(x-3))^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4 = x - 3\n\nStep 6: Solve for x.\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\nx = 7\n\nNow, we need to check if our solution is valid by plugging it back into the original equation:\n\n√(7+5) - √(7-3) = 2\n\n√12 - √4 = 2\n\n2√3 - 2 = 2\n\nSince the left side of the equation equals the right side, our solution x = 7 is valid."
