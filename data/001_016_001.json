    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we will use the properties of exponents. When multiplying two numbers with the same base, we add their exponents. When dividing two numbers with the same base, we subtract their exponents.\n\n2^3 × 2^4 ÷ 2^2\n\nFirst, we will multiply 2^3 and 2^4:\n\n(2^3) × (2^4) = 2^(3+4) = 2^7\n\nNow, we will divide the result by 2^2:\n\n(2^7) ÷ (2^2) = 2^(7-2) = 2^5\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n2^5"
