    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the cartesian products A × (B ∩ {3}).",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of B and {3}. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, B ∩ {3} = {3} since 3 is the only element common to both B and {3}.\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product A × (B ∩ {3}). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set (A) and b is an element of the second set (B ∩ {3}).\n\nSo, A × (B ∩ {3}) = A × {3} = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}\n\nThe Cartesian product A × (B ∩ {3}) is the set {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}."
