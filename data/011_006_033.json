    "message_1": "A box contains 4 blue balls, 5 red balls, and 3 green balls. In how many ways can you choose 6 balls from the box such that there are at least 2 blue balls and 1 red ball? Use generating functions to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first assign a generating function to each color of balls:\n\n1. Blue balls: Since there are 4 blue balls and we need at least 2, the generating function for blue balls is x^2 + x^3 + x^4.\n\n2. Red balls: There are 5 red balls and we need at least 1, so the generating function for red balls is x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5.\n\n3. Green balls: There are 3 green balls and we don't have any specific requirement for them, so the generating function for green balls is 1 + x + x^2 + x^3.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of x^6 in the product of these generating functions:\n\n(x^2 + x^3 + x^4) * (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5) * (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)\n\nExpanding the product and collecting the terms with x^6, we get:\n\nx^6 * (4 + 3 + 2 + 1)\n\nThe coefficient of x^6 is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose 6 balls from the box such that there are at least 2 blue balls and 1 red ball."
