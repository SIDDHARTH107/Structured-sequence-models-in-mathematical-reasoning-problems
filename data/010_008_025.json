    "message_2": "A 3-dimensional simplex (also known as a tetrahedron) is formed by a set of 4 vertices and all 6 possible edges between them. To find the number of 3-dimensional simplices in the simplicial complex K, we need to find all the possible combinations of 4 vertices that have all 6 edges present in K.\n\nLet's list down all the possible combinations of 4 vertices from the given set `{1,2,3,4,5}`:\n\n1. {1,2,3,4}\n2. {1,2,3,5}\n3. {1,2,4,5}\n4. {1,3,4,5}\n5. {2,3,4,5}\n\nNow, let's check if all 6 edges are present in K for each combination:\n\n1. {1,2,3,4}: Edges are {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,1}, {1,3}, and {2,4}. The edge {1,3} is not in K, so this is not a 3-dimensional simplex.\n2. {1,2,3,5}: Edges are {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,5}, {5,1}, {1,3}, and {2,5}. All edges are in K, so this is a 3-dimensional simplex.\n3. {1,2,4,5}: Edges are {1,2}, {2,4}, {4,5}, {5,1}, {1,4}, and {2,5}. The edge {1,4} is not in K, so this is not a 3-dimensional simplex.\n4. {1,3,4,5}: Edges are {1,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {5,1}, {1,4}, and {3,5}. The edge {1,4} is not in K, so this is not a 3-dimensional simplex.\n5. {2,3,4,5}: Edges are {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {5,2}, {2,4}, and {3,5}. The edge {3,5} is not in K, so this is not a 3-dimensional simplex.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that there is only one 3-dimensional simplex in the simplicial complex K, which is formed by the vertices {1,2,3,5}."
