    "message_2": "Let G be a cyclic group with 30 elements. Since G is a cyclic group, it has a generator, say g, such that G = {g^0, g^1, ..., g^29}. The order of G is 30, which can be factored as 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, the subgroups of G are determined by the divisors of the order of G.\n\nThe divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. For each divisor d, there exists a unique subgroup of G with order d, which is generated by the element g^(30/d). Therefore, we have the following subgroups:\n\n1. H_1 = {g^0} with order 1 (cyclic)\n2. H_2 = {g^0, g^15} with order 2 (cyclic)\n3. H_3 = {g^0, g^10, g^20} with order 3 (cyclic)\n4. H_5 = {g^0, g^6, g^12, g^18, g^24} with order 5 (cyclic)\n5. H_6 = {g^0, g^5, g^10, g^15, g^20, g^25} with order 6 (cyclic)\n6. H_10 = {g^0, g^3, g^6, g^9, g^12, g^15, g^18, g^21, g^24, g^27} with order 10 (cyclic)\n7. H_15 = {g^0, g^2, g^4, ..., g^28} with order 15 (cyclic)\n8. H_30 = G = {g^0, g^1, ..., g^29} with order 30 (cyclic)\n\nAll the subgroups of G are cyclic, as they are generated by a single element."
