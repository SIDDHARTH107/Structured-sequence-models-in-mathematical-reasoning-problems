    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem:\n\nA factory produces two products, product A and product B, that require the use of two machines, machine X and machine Y. Product A requires 4 hours on machine X and 3 hours on machine Y, while product B requires 5 hours on machine X and 2 hours on machine Y. Machine X is available for a maximum of 80 hours per week, while machine Y is available for a maximum of 60 hours per week. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and the profit per unit of product B is $8. What is the maximum profit that the factory can earn per week, and what is the optimal production schedule for each product?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let's define the variables:\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A produced per week.\nLet y be the number of units of product B produced per week.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 8y\n\nThe constraints are given by the machine hours available:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 80 (Machine X constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 60 (Machine Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 4x + 5y ≤ 80\n   y ≤ (80 - 4x) / 5\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 60\n   y ≤ (60 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,12), (8,10), and (20,0). We can now evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0,0): 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0,12): 10(0) + 8(12) = $96\n3. Profit at (8,10): 10(8) + 8(10) = $144\n4. Profit at (20,0): 10(20) + 8(0) = $200\n\nThe maximum profit is $200 per week, which occurs when the factory produces 20 units of product A and 0 units of product B. The optimal production schedule is to focus solely on producing product A."
