She privately chooses `a=3` as her secret integer, while Bob chooses `b=5` as his secret integer. What is the shared secret key between Alice and Bob?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is her secret integer, and p is the prime number.\n   A = 2^3 mod 11 = 8\n\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where g is the primitive root, b is his secret integer, and p is the prime number.\n   B = 2^5 mod 11 = 10\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K = B^a mod p.\n   K = 10^3 mod 11 = 5\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K = A^b mod p.\n   K = 8^5 mod 11 = 5\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have computed the same shared secret key, K = 5."
