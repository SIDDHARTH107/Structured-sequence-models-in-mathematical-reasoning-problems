    "message_1": "A company wants to determine whether a candidate is suitable for a job based on their age, experience, and past performance. The company collected data from past employees including their age, years of experience, and performance rating (on a scale of 1 to 10). Using discriminant analysis, determine whether a new candidate with the following information is suitable for the job:\n\nAge: 35\nYears of experience: 8\nPerformance rating: 7.5",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we need the data from past employees to create a model that can classify the new candidate as suitable or not suitable for the job. Unfortunately, the data from past employees is not provided in the problem statement. \n\nHowever, I can provide a general outline of the steps to perform discriminant analysis:\n\n1. Collect the data from past employees, including their age, years of experience, performance rating, and whether they were suitable or not suitable for the job.\n\n2. Split the data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to create the discriminant analysis model, while the test set will be used to evaluate the model's accuracy.\n\n3. Perform the discriminant analysis on the training set to create a model. This involves finding the linear combination of the predictor variables (age, years of experience, and performance rating) that best separates the suitable and not suitable employees.\n\n4. Evaluate the model's accuracy by applying it to the test set. Calculate the percentage of correct classifications to determine how well the model performs.\n\n5. Apply the discriminant analysis model to the new candidate's information (age: 35, years of experience: 8, performance rating: 7.5) to determine whether they are suitable or not suitable for the job.\n\nWithout the actual data from past employees, we cannot perform the discriminant analysis and provide a definitive answer for the new candidate's suitability."
