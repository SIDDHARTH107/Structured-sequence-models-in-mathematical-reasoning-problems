    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (a sector of a larger circle) and then add them together.\n\n1. Base area (A_base): \nA_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (5 cm)^2\nA_base = 25π cm^2\n\n2. Lateral area (A_lateral):\nA_lateral = 1/2 * Circumference of the base * Slant height\nA_lateral = 1/2 * (2π * r) * l\nA_lateral = 1/2 * (2π * 5 cm) * 12 cm\nA_lateral = 1/2 * (10π cm) * 12 cm\nA_lateral = 60π cm^2\n\n3. Total surface area (A_total):\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π cm^2 + 60π cm^2\nA_total = 85π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 85π cm^2."
