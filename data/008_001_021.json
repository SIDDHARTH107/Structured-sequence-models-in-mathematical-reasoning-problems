Perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n3. Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 4 |\n| 2  3  4 | 5 |\n| 3  4  5 | 6 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the 2 in the second row and the 3 in the third row by subtracting multiples of the first row from the other rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n| 1  2  3 |  4 |\n| 0 -1 -2 | -3 |\n| 0 -2 -4 | -6 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the -2 in the third row by subtracting multiples of the second row from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 2 * R2\n\n| 1  2  3 |  4 |\n| 0 -1 -2 | -3 |\n| 0  0  0 |  0 |\n\nStep 3: Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nSince the third row is all zeros, we have an underdetermined system, which means there are infinitely many solutions. We can express the solution in terms of a free variable, z.\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-1y - 2z = -3\n\ny = 2z + 3\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 4\n\nSubstitute the expression for y:\n\nx + 2(2z + 3) + 3z = 4\n\nx + 4z + 6 + 3z = 4\n\nx + 7z = -2\n\nx = -7z - 2\n\nSo the general solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -7z - 2\ny = 2z + 3\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
