    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The smallest perfect number greater than 10,000 is 33,550,336. It is derived from the formula (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1) when p = 16 and 2^p - 1 is a Mersenne prime. In this case, 2^16 - 1 = 65,535, which is a Mersenne prime."
