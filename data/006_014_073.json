    "message_1": "A certain technological system has a probability of 0.1 for a failure to occur during any given hour of operation. What is the probability that a failure will occur within the first 30 minutes of operation?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a failure occurring within the first 30 minutes of operation, we can first find the probability of no failure occurring during that time and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of a failure occurring in any given hour is 0.1. Therefore, the probability of no failure occurring in an hour is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSince there are 2 sets of 30 minutes in an hour, we need to find the probability of no failure occurring in a 30-minute period. To do this, we can take the square root of the probability of no failure occurring in an hour:\n\n√0.9 ≈ 0.9487\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a failure occurring within the first 30 minutes by subtracting the probability of no failure occurring in that time from 1:\n\n1 - 0.9487 ≈ 0.0513\n\nSo, the probability of a failure occurring within the first 30 minutes of operation is approximately 0.0513 or 5.13%."
