    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the vector of unknowns, and b is the constant vector.\n\nA = | 1  2  1 |, x = | x |, b = |  5  |\n    | 2  5  6 |      | y |      | 17  |\n    | 1  2 10 |      | z |      | 12  |\n\nNow, we need to decompose matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, i.e., A = LL^T.\n\nUsing Cholesky decomposition, we find L:\n\nL = | 1   0   0 | \n    | 2   1   0 | \n    | 1   0   3 |\n\nNow, we will solve the system in two steps:\n\n1. Solve Ly = b for y\n2. Solve L^Tx = y for x\n\nStep 1: Solve Ly = b for y\n\n| 1   0   0 | | y1 |   |  5  |\n| 2   1   0 | | y2 | = | 17  |\n| 1   0   3 | | y3 |   | 12  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 5\ny2 = 17 - 2y1 = 7\ny3 = (12 - y1)/3 = 2\n\nSo, y = | 5 |\n          | 7 |\n          | 2 |\n\nStep 2: Solve L^Tx = y for x\n\nL^T = | 1  2  1 | \n\n       | 0  1  0 | \n\n       | 0  0  3 |\n\n| 1  2  1 | | x |   |  5  |\n| 0  1  0 | | y | = |  7  |\n| 0  0  3 | | z |   |  2  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nz = 2/3\ny = 7\nx = (5 - 2y - z)/1 = -2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -2\ny = 7\nz = 2/3"
