    "message_2": "To determine the parallel transport of the vector v = (1, 0, 0) along the curve r(t) = (2t, 3t, 4t) from t=0 to t=1, we first need to find the tangent vector to the curve at each point.\n\nThe tangent vector T(t) is given by the derivative of the curve r(t) with respect to t:\n\nT(t) = dr/dt = (2, 3, 4)\n\nSince the tangent vector is constant, the curve is a straight line in three-dimensional space.\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the vector v along this curve. The parallel transport of a vector along a curve is the vector that remains parallel to the original vector while moving along the curve.\n\nSince the curve is a straight line, the vector v = (1, 0, 0) will remain parallel to itself as it moves along the curve. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve r(t) from t=0 to t=1 is simply the vector v itself:\n\nParallel transport of v = (1, 0, 0)"
