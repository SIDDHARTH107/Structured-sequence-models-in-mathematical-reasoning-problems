    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Since 27 = 3^3, we know that G has a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3^3 = 27. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 27, the only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then P is a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 27, which is the same as the order of G, we have that P = G. Thus, G is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either cyclic or a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, G is either cyclic of order 27 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, let P, Q, and R be distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since the intersection of distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have that |P ∩ Q ∩ R| = 1. Now, consider the product PQ. Since |P| = |Q| = 27 and |P ∩ Q| = 9 (by the Sylow theorems), we have by the Second Isomorphism Theorem that |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 27 * 27 / 9 = 81. However, this is not possible since the order of G is 27. Therefore, there cannot be three Sylow 3-subgroups, and we are left with the first case.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
