G - (1, 2): The graph obtained by deleting the edge (1, 2) is a cycle of length 4, denoted as C4. The Tutte polynomial of a cycle of length n is given by (x-1)^{n-1} (y-1)^{n-1} + (y-1)^n. Therefore, T(C4; x, y) = (x-1)^3 (y-1)^3 + (y-1)^4.\n\n2. G * (1, 2): The graph obtained by contracting the edge (1, 2) is a triangle, denoted as C3. The Tutte polynomial of a triangle is given by (x-1)^2 (y-1)^2 + (y-1)^3. Therefore, T(C3; x, y) = (x-1)^2 (y-1)^2 + (y-1)^3.\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomial of G:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - (1, 2); x, y) + T(G * (1, 2); x, y)\nT(G; x, y) = [(x-1)^3 (y-1)^3 + (y-1)^4] + [(x-1)^2 (y-1)^2 + (y-1)^3]\nT(G; x, y) = (x-1)^3 (y-1)^3 + (y-1)^4 + (x-1)^2 (y-1)^2 + (y-1)^3\n\nThus, the Tutte polynomial of G is:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x-1)^3 (y-1)^3 + (y-1)^4 + (x-1)^2 (y-1)^2 + (y-1)^3."
