    "message_1": "Suppose you have a plaintext message that consists of 64 bits and a Feistel cipher structure that divide the message into two halves, with each half having 32 bits. If the Feistel cipher structure uses 16 rounds and the key for each round is 48 bits long, how long will the ciphertext message be after encryption?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the plaintext message is divided into two halves, and each round consists of processing these halves with a specific key. After all the rounds are completed, the two halves are combined to form the ciphertext message. The length of the keys used in each round does not affect the length of the ciphertext message.\n\nSince the plaintext message is 64 bits long and divided into two halves of 32 bits each, after 16 rounds of the Feistel cipher, the ciphertext message will still consist of two halves of 32 bits each. Therefore, the length of the ciphertext message after encryption will be 64 bits."
