    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set, such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Let set A = {2, 4, 6, 8}. Evaluate A complement and find the union of A and its complement. Prove that the union is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, denoted as A', we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of set A and the universal set U, we can determine the elements that are not in set A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements of both sets. In this case, we are finding the union of A and A':\n\nA ∪ A' = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A or x ∈ A'}\n\nCombining the elements of set A and A', we get:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U. By definition, the universal set U contains all the elements under consideration. In this case, the union of set A and its complement A' contains all the elements of the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} = U\n\nThus, we have proven that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
