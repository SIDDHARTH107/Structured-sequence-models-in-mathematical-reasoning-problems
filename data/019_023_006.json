    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I must clarify that the probability of a theorem being true cannot be determined by the opinions of mathematicians. A theorem is either true or false based on its logical proof. If a theorem has a valid proof, it is considered true for all mathematicians. If it doesn't have a valid proof or has a counterexample, it is considered false. The opinions of the mathematicians surveyed do not determine the truth of the theorem."
