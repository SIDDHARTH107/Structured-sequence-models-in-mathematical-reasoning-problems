    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between the number of hours studied and the final exam score, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / sqrt[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, x̄ is the mean of x values (hours studied), and ȳ is the mean of y values (final exam scores).\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of hours studied (x̄) and the mean of final exam scores (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (3 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 2 + 9 + 1 + 0) / 10 = 45 / 10 = 4.5\nȳ = (76 + 83 + 85 + 78 + 90 + 92 + 70 + 95 + 65 + 60) / 10 = 794 / 10 = 79.4\n\nNext, we will calculate the individual terms (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) and sum them up:\n\n(3-4.5)(76-79.4) + (5-4.5)(83-79.4) + (6-4.5)(85-79.4) + (4-4.5)(78-79.4) + (7-4.5)(90-79.4) + (8-4.5)(92-79.4) + (2-4.5)(70-79.4) + (9-4.5)(95-79.4) + (1-4.5)(65-79.4) + (0-4.5)(60-79.4) = 142.5\n\nNow, we will calculate the individual terms (xi - x̄)² and (yi - ȳ)², and sum them up:\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = (3-4.5)² + (5-4.5)² + (6-4.5)² + (4-4.5)² + (7-4.5)² + (8-4.5)² + (2-4.5)² + (9-4.5)² + (1-4.5)² + (0-4.5)² = 82.5\nΣ(yi - ȳ)² = (76-79.4)² + (83-79.4)² + (85-79.4)² + (78-79.4)² + (90-79.4)² + (92-79.4)² + (70-79.4)² + (95-79.4)² + (65-79.4)² + (60-79.4)² = 1236.4\n\nFinally, we will plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = 142.5 / sqrt(82.5 * 1236.4) = 142.5 / sqrt(101940) ≈ 0.9754\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the final exam score is approximately 0.9754. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the two variables."
