    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust obtained by removing the middle third of a line segment infinitely many times can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, N = 2 (as two line segments remain after removing the middle third) and the scaling factor r = 3 (as each remaining segment is 1/3 the length of the previous segment).\n\nHence, the Hausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.63 (rounded to two decimal places)."
