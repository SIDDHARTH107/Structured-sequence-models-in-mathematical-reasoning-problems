The number of people infected is growing at a rate proportional to the number of infected people and the number of people who are susceptible to the disease. The total population of the city is 10,000, and it is estimated that initially, 100 people were infected. If the rate of infection is 0.025, find the total number of infected people after one week.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model, which is a simple mathematical model for the spread of infectious diseases. In this case, we are only concerned with the susceptible and infected populations.\n\nLet S(t) be the number of susceptible people at time t, and I(t) be the number of infected people at time t. The total population N is constant, so N = S(t) + I(t). The rate of change of the infected population is given by dI/dt = k * S * I, where k is the rate of infection.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The total population N = 10,000\n- The initial number of infected people I(0) = 100\n- The rate of infection k = 0.025\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial number of susceptible people S(0):\nS(0) = N - I(0) = 10,000 - 100 = 9,900\n\nNow, we can write the differential equation for the infected population:\ndI/dt = 0.025 * S * I\n\nSince N = S + I, we can rewrite S as S = N - I, and substitute it into the differential equation:\ndI/dt = 0.025 * (N - I) * I\n\nThis is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. To solve it, we can use the method of separation of variables. Rearrange the equation to get:\ndI / ((N - I) * I) = 0.025 * dt\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n∫(1 / ((N - I) * I)) dI = ∫(0.025) dt\n\nLet's use a substitution method to solve the integral on the left side. Let u = N - I, so du = -dI. The integral becomes:\n-∫(1 / (u * (N - u))) du = 0.025 * ∫dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n-ln(|u(N - u)|) = 0.025 * t + C₁\n\nSubstitute back u = N - I:\n-ln(|(N - I)I|) = 0.025 * t + C₁\n\nNow, we need to find the constant of integration C₁ using the initial condition I(0) = 100:\n-ln(|(N - 100)(100)|) = 0.025 * 0 + C₁\n-ln(9900 * 100) = C₁\n\nNow we have the general solution of the differential equation:\n-ln(|(N - I)I|) = 0.025 * t - ln(9900 * 100)\n\nTo find the number of infected people after one week (t = 7 days), we can solve for I:\n0.025 * 7 = ln((9900 * 100) / ((N - I)I))\n\nLet x = (9900 * 100) / ((N - I)I), then:\nln(x) = 0.025 * 7\nx = e^(0.025 * 7)\n\nNow, solve for I:\n(9900 * 100) / ((N - I)I) = e^(0.025 * 7)\n(9900 * 100) = e^(0.025 * 7) * (N - I)I\n\nI = (N * e^(0.025 * 7)) / (1 + e^(0.025 * 7))\n\nSubstitute the given values N = 10,000 and t = 7:\nI = (10,000 * e^(0.025 * 7)) / (1 + e^(0.025 * 7))\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\nI ≈ 1,785.24\n\nTherefore, after one week, approximately 1,785 people will be infected in the city."
