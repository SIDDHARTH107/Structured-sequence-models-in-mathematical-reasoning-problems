    "message_1": "A manufacturer of cable wires claims that the average breaking strength of their product is 75 pounds. A sample of 50 wires was taken, and the mean breaking strength was found to be 72 pounds with a standard deviation of 4.5 pounds. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean breaking strength of the wires.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean breaking strength of the wires, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence interval = sample mean ± (critical value * standard error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the Z-table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard error = sample standard deviation / √sample size\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard error = 4.5 / √50 = 4.5 / 7.071 = 0.636\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of error = 1.96 * 0.636 = 1.246\n\nFinally, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence interval = 72 ± 1.246 = (70.754, 73.246)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean breaking strength of the wires is (70.754, 73.246) pounds."
