    "message_2": "The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1). We can apply this rule to each term in the given function.\n\nf(x) = 3x^5 - 2x^3 + 4x - 1\n\nTo find the derivative, we'll apply the power rule to each term:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^5)/dx - d(2x^3)/dx + d(4x)/dx - d(1)/dx\n\nFor the first term, 3x^5, the power rule gives us:\n(5)(3)x^(5-1) = 15x^4\n\nFor the second term, 2x^3, the power rule gives us:\n(3)(2)x^(3-1) = 6x^2\n\nFor the third term, 4x, the power rule gives us:\n(1)(4)x^(1-1) = 4\n\nFor the constant term, -1, the derivative is 0, since the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we can combine these results to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^4 - 6x^2 + 4\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5 - 2x^3 + 4x - 1 is f'(x) = 15x^4 - 6x^2 + 4."
