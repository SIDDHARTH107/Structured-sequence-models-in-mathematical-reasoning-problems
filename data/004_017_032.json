    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^2/4 on the interval [0, 4], we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx):\n\ny = x^2/4\ndy/dx = (1/4) * 2x = x/2\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + (x/2)^2) dx\n\nTo make it easier to integrate, we can rewrite the expression under the square root:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + x^2/4) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nLet's use substitution method:\nLet u = x^2/4, then du/dx = x/2, and dx = 2du/x\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + u) * (2du/x)\n\nSince we changed the variable, we also need to change the limits of integration. When x = 0, u = 0^2/4 = 0, and when x = 4, u = 4^2/4 = 4.\n\nSo, the new integral is:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + u) * (2du/x)\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to u:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] 2√(1 + u) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = 2 * (2/3) * (u + 1)^(3/2) | [0, 4]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nL = (4/3) * [(4 + 1)^(3/2) - (0 + 1)^(3/2)]\n\nL = (4/3) * [5^(3/2) - 1^(3/2)]\n\nL = (4/3) * [5√5 - 1]\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^2/4 on the interval [0, 4] is (4/3) * [5√5 - 1]."
