    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ of the given differential form $\\omega = xyz dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$, we need to apply the exterior derivative to each of the components of the form.\n\nRecall that the exterior derivative is a linear operator, and it obeys the product rule for the wedge product. The exterior derivative of a scalar function is its gradient, and the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form. In this case, we have a 3-form, so the exterior derivative of a 3-form is a 4-form. However, since we are in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, there are no 4-forms, and the exterior derivative of a 3-form is always zero.\n\nTherefore, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n\n$$d\\omega = 0$$"
