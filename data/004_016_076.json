    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, we have a continuous function representing the position of the car over time, and we want to find the average speed of the car over the interval [0, 2] hours.\n\nThe average speed of the car can be found by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time)\nAverage speed = (100 miles) / (2 hours)\nAverage speed = 50 miles per hour\n\nSo, the average speed of the car on this journey is 50 miles per hour. According to the Mean Value Theorem, there must be a point in time during the journey where the car's instantaneous speed is exactly 50 miles per hour."
