    "message_1": "There are three boxes, each of which has either a white or a black ball. Box 1 has two white balls, Box 2 has two black balls, and Box 3 has one white and one black ball. If you choose a box at random and draw a ball at random from that box, and it turns out to be white, what is the probability that you chose Box 1?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred is equal to the probability of event B given that event A has occurred, multiplied by the probability of event A, and divided by the probability of event B.\n\nLet A be the event of choosing Box 1, and B be the event of drawing a white ball. We want to find the probability of A given B, or P(A|B).\n\nWe know the following probabilities:\nP(A) = 1/3 (since there are 3 boxes and we choose one at random)\nP(B|A) = 1 (since there are 2 white balls in Box 1, and we are sure to draw a white ball if we choose Box 1)\n\nNow we need to find the probability of drawing a white ball, or P(B). We can find this by considering the probabilities of drawing a white ball from each box:\n\nP(B) = P(B|Box 1) * P(Box 1) + P(B|Box 2) * P(Box 2) + P(B|Box 3) * P(Box 3)\n\nP(B) = (1) * (1/3) + (0) * (1/3) + (1/2) * (1/3)\nP(B) = 1/3 + 0 + 1/6\nP(B) = 1/2\n\nNow we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\nP(A|B) = (1) * (1/3) / (1/2)\nP(A|B) = (1/3) / (1/2)\nP(A|B) = (1/3) * (2/1)\nP(A|B) = 2/3\n\nSo the probability that you chose Box 1 given that you drew a white ball is 2/3."
