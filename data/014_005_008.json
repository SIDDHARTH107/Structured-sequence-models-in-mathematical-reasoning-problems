    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific numerical problem related to digital signatures:\n\nSuppose a message M in binary format has a hash value of H(M) = 1011011. Alice wants to sign the message using her private key d = 23 and public key (n,e) = (35,7). Using the RSA encryption scheme, what is the digital signature for the message M?",
    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature for the message M, we need to use Alice's private key (d) and the hash value of the message H(M). In this case, d = 23 and H(M) = 1011011.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the binary hash value H(M) to its decimal equivalent. \n\nH(M) = 1011011 (binary)\nH(M) = 1*(2^6) + 0*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 1*(2^0)\nH(M) = 64 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1\nH(M) = 91 (decimal)\n\nNow, we can use the RSA encryption scheme to compute the digital signature (S) for the message M:\n\nS ≡ H(M)^d mod n\nS ≡ 91^23 mod 35\n\nTo compute this, we can use the square-and-multiply algorithm for modular exponentiation:\n\n1. Write the exponent (23) in binary: 10111\n2. Initialize the result (R) to 1: R = 1\n3. Iterate through the binary representation of the exponent from left to right:\n   - If the current bit is 1, square R and multiply it by the base (91), then reduce modulo 35.\n   - If the current bit is 0, just square R and reduce modulo 35.\n\nIteration 1 (first bit is 1):\nR = (R * 91) mod 35 = (1 * 91) mod 35 = 91 mod 35 = 21\n\nIteration 2 (second bit is 0):\nR = (R^2) mod 35 = (21^2) mod 35 = 441 mod 35 = 21\n\nIteration 3 (third bit is 1):\nR = (R * 91) mod 35 = (21 * 91) mod 35 = 1911 mod 35 = 1\n\nIteration 4 (fourth bit is 1):\nR = (R * 91) mod 35 = (1 * 91) mod 35 = 91 mod 35 = 21\n\nIteration 5 (fifth bit is 1):\nR = (R * 91) mod 35 = (21 * 91) mod 35 = 1911 mod 35 = 1\n\nThe result of the modular exponentiation is R = 1. Therefore, the digital signature for the message M is S = 1."
