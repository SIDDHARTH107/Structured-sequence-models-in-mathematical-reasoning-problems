    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation 7x + 13y = 123, we first need to find one particular solution. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 13, as well as the coefficients that satisfy the equation.\n\nThe GCD of 7 and 13 is 1, since they are both prime numbers. Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the coefficients:\n\n13 = 1 * 7 + 6\n7 = 1 * 6 + 1\n1 = 7 - 1 * 6\n1 = 7 - 1 * (13 - 1 * 7)\n1 = 2 * 7 - 1 * 13\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n1 = 2 * 7 - 1 * 13\n\nNow, we want to find the coefficients for the equation 7x + 13y = 123. We can multiply both sides of the equation above by 123:\n\n123 = 2 * 7 * 123 - 1 * 13 * 123\n\nNow, we have:\n\n123 = 7 * (2 * 123) + 13 * (-1 * 123)\n\nSo, one particular solution is x = 2 * 123 and y = -1 * 123.\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions using the general formula for Diophantine equations:\n\nx = x0 + k * (b / gcd(a, b))\ny = y0 - k * (a / gcd(a, b))\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solution we found, a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the original equation (7 and 13), gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b (1), and k is an integer.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nx = 2 * 123 + k * (13 / 1)\ny = -1 * 123 - k * (7 / 1)\n\nx = 246 + 13k\ny = -123 - 7k\n\nFor all integer values of k, this will give us all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation 7x + 13y = 123."
