    "message_2": "To find the Riemann map that maps the given region to the upper half-plane, we can use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula. The Schwarz-Christoffel formula is given by:\n\nf(z) = A ∫(dz / (z - z_1)^α1 ... (z - z_n)^αn) + B\n\nwhere A and B are constants, z_1, ..., z_n are the prevertices, and α_1, ..., α_n are the angles of the polygon in the target domain (upper half-plane) divided by π.\n\nIn our case, the region is bounded by the unit circle and the real axis from -1 to 1. The prevertices are z_1 = -1, z_2 = 1, and z_3 = 0. The angles of the corresponding vertices in the upper half-plane are α_1 = α_2 = 1 (since they are both right angles) and α_3 = 2 (since it is a straight angle).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Schwarz-Christoffel formula:\n\nf(z) = A ∫(dz / (z - (-1))^1 (z - 1)^1 (z - 0)^2) + B\n\nSimplify the integral:\n\nf(z) = A ∫(dz / (z + 1)(z - 1)z^2) + B\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can use the boundary conditions. Since f(-1) should map to the point at infinity in the upper half-plane, we have:\n\nA ∫(-1 to -1) (dz / (z + 1)(z - 1)z^2) + B = ∞\n\nThis implies that B = -A.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of A. We can use the fact that f(1) should map to the real axis in the upper half-plane. Let's denote f(1) = x, then we have:\n\nA ∫(-1 to 1) (dz / (z + 1)(z - 1)z^2) + (-A) = x\n\nSince the integral is an odd function, the integral from -1 to 1 is zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n-A + A = x\nx = 0\n\nNow we know that f(1) = 0, and f(-1) = ∞. The Riemann map is given by:\n\nf(z) = A ∫(dz / (z + 1)(z - 1)z^2) - A\n\nTo find the exact form of the Riemann map, we need to evaluate the integral. However, this integral is quite complicated and does not have a simple closed-form expression. In practice, one would use numerical methods to approximate the Riemann map for specific points in the region."
