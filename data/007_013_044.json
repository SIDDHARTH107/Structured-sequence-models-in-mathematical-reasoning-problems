    "message_1": "How many even integers between 2 and 100 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Although this conjecture has not been proven, it has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large numbers and found to be true.\n\nSince we are looking for even integers between 2 and 100, we have a total of 49 even integers (4, 6, 8, ..., 100). According to the Goldbach Conjecture, all of these even integers can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, there are 49 even integers between 2 and 100 that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."
