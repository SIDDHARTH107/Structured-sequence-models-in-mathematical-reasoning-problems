    "message_2": "To find a conformal map that maps the interior of the unit circle onto the upper half-plane and maps the point i to the point 0, we can use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex numbers and ad - bc ≠ 0.\n\nFirst, we want to map the point i to 0. To do this, we can set b = -ai:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az - ai}{cz + d}$$\n\nNext, we want to map the point -i to infinity. This will ensure that the unit circle is mapped to the real axis. To do this, we can set c = a:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az - ai}{az + d}$$\n\nNow, we want to map the point 1 to 1. This will ensure that the interior of the unit circle is mapped to the upper half-plane. Plugging in z = 1, we get:\n\n$$f(1) = \\frac{a - ai}{a + d} = 1$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by (a + d), we get:\n\n$$a - ai = a + d$$\n\nThis implies that d = -ai. Substituting this back into the Möbius transformation, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az - ai}{az - ai}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{a(z - i)}{a(z - i)} = 1$$\n\nThis is not the desired conformal map, so we need to modify our approach. Instead of mapping 1 to 1, let's map -1 to 1. Plugging in z = -1, we get:\n\n$$f(-1) = \\frac{-a - ai}{-a - ai} = 1$$\n\nThis implies that a = i. Substituting this back into the Möbius transformation, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{iz - i^2}{iz + 1} = \\frac{iz + 1}{iz + 1} = 1$$\n\nThis is still not the desired conformal map. However, we can compose this map with another Möbius transformation that maps 1 to infinity and 0 to 1. Such a transformation is given by:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{z - 1}{z}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the composition of f and g:\n\n$$h(z) = g(f(z)) = g(1) = \\frac{1 - 1}{1} = 0$$\n\nThis map sends i to 0, as desired. Furthermore, it maps the unit circle to the real axis and the interior of the unit circle to the upper half-plane. Therefore, the conformal map we are looking for is:\n\n$$h(z) = \\frac{z - 1}{z}$$"
