    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given graph G with 6 vertices, 10 edges, and each vertex having degree 3. Since every vertex has the same degree, G is a regular graph. The number of edges in a regular graph can be calculated using the formula m = (n * d) / 2. In this case, m = (6 * 3) / 2 = 9, but we are given that G has 10 edges. This means that G cannot be a regular graph with every vertex having degree 3.\n\nHowever, if we assume that there is an error in the problem statement and G has 9 edges instead of 10, then G would be a 3-regular graph with 6 vertices. In this case, G would be the complete bipartite graph K_3,3, which is the unique 3-regular graph with 6 vertices.\n\nNow, let's determine the automorphism group of G. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (permutations of the vertices that preserve adjacency). For the complete bipartite graph K_3,3, the automorphism group is the symmetric group S_3 acting independently on both parts of the bipartition.\n\nThe order of the automorphism group is the number of elements in the group. The order of the symmetric group S_3 is 3! = 6, so the order of the automorphism group of K_3,3 is the product of the orders of S_3 acting on both parts, which is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nTherefore, if G is the complete bipartite graph K_3,3, the order of the automorphism group of G is 36."
