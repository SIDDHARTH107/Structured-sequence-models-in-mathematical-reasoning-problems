    "message_2": "To find the solution set for the inequality 2x + 3 < 5x - 7, we first need to solve for x:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2x from both sides of the inequality:\n3 < 3x - 7\n\nStep 2: Add 7 to both sides of the inequality:\n10 < 3x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 3:\n10/3 < x\n\nSo, the solution set for the inequality is x > 10/3.\n\nOn a number line, this would be represented by an open circle at 10/3 (approximately 3.33) and an arrow pointing to the right, indicating that all values greater than 10/3 are part of the solution set."
