    "message_1": "In a certain community, 60% of the residents are women and 40% are men. If a social event is planned and the organizer wants to invite 5 people randomly from the community, what is the probability that all 5 invitees will be women?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that all 5 invitees will be women, we need to multiply the probability of each individual invitee being a woman. Since there is a 60% chance of a resident being a woman, the probability can be calculated as follows:\n\n(0.60) * (0.60) * (0.60) * (0.60) * (0.60) = (0.60)^5 = 0.07776\n\nSo, the probability that all 5 invitees will be women is approximately 7.776%."
