    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection $X \\cap Y$. Since $Y$ is a quadric surface in $\\mathbb{RP}^3$, it is a 2-dimensional submanifold of $X$. Thus, $X \\cap Y = Y$. Now we need to find the Poincaré polynomial of the intersection cohomology group $IH^*(Y)$.\n\nRecall that the Poincaré polynomial is given by $P(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^n b_it^i$, where $b_i$ is the $i$-th Betti number, which is the rank of the $i$-th cohomology group.\n\nThe quadric surface $Y$ is a smooth, orientable, closed 2-dimensional manifold. Therefore, it has the same cohomology as a 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$. The Betti numbers for $S^2$ are $b_0 = b_2 = 1$ and $b_1 = 0$. Thus, the Poincaré polynomial for $IH^*(Y)$ is:\n\n$P(t) = 1 + 0t + 1t^2 = 1 + t^2$.\n\nSo, the Poincaré polynomial of the intersection cohomology group $IH^*(X \\cap Y)$ is $1 + t^2$."
