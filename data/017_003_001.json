    "message_2": "A generator (also called a primitive element) of a cyclic group is an element that can generate all other elements of the group by repeated applications of the group operation. In the case of a cyclic group of order 17, which is a prime number, any element other than the identity element (1) can be a generator.\n\nFor example, let's consider the group Z_17 (the integers modulo 17 under addition). In this group, the element 1 is the identity element. Any other element, say 2, can be a generator:\n\n2 (mod 17) = 2\n2 * 2 (mod 17) = 4\n2 * 3 (mod 17) = 6\n...\n2 * 16 (mod 17) = 15\n\nAs you can see, by multiplying 2 by the integers from 1 to 16 (mod 17), we generate all the non-identity elements of the group. Therefore, 2 is a generator of the cyclic group of order 17. In fact, any element other than 1 in Z_17 will be a generator, since 17 is a prime number."
