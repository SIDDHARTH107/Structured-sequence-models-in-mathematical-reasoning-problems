    "message_1": "In a community of 400 people, 240 own a car, 120 own a bike, and 40 own both a car and a bike. If one person is chosen at random from the community, what is the probability that they own only a car or only a bike?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a person owns only a car or only a bike, we first need to find the number of people who own only a car, only a bike, or both.\n\nWe know that:\n- 240 people own a car\n- 120 people own a bike\n- 40 people own both a car and a bike\n\nTo find the number of people who own only a car, we subtract the number of people who own both a car and a bike from the total number of people who own a car:\n\nOnly car = Total car owners - Both car and bike owners\nOnly car = 240 - 40\nOnly car = 200\n\nSimilarly, to find the number of people who own only a bike, we subtract the number of people who own both a car and a bike from the total number of people who own a bike:\n\nOnly bike = Total bike owners - Both car and bike owners\nOnly bike = 120 - 40\nOnly bike = 80\n\nNow, we have:\n- 200 people who own only a car\n- 80 people who own only a bike\n\nThe total number of people who own only a car or only a bike is:\n\nTotal = Only car + Only bike\nTotal = 200 + 80\nTotal = 280\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a person chosen at random from the community owns only a car or only a bike. The probability is the ratio of the number of people who own only a car or only a bike to the total number of people in the community:\n\nProbability = (Number of people who own only a car or only a bike) / (Total number of people in the community)\nProbability = 280 / 400\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nProbability = 7 / 10\n\nSo, the probability that a person chosen at random from the community owns only a car or only a bike is 7/10 or 0.7."
