    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to represent the system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  1 |\n    | 2  3  4 |\n    | 4  3  2 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 15 |\n    | 35 |\n    | 25 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nPerforming Gaussian elimination on A:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\nA = | 1  2   1 |\n    | 0 -1   2 |\n    | 0 -5  -2 |\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 4  0  1 |\n\n2. Subtract 5 times the second row from the third row:\n\nA = | 1  2   1 |\n    | 0 -1   2 |\n    | 0  0  -12 |\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 4  5  1 |\n\nNow, we have the LU decomposition of A:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 4  5  1 |\n\nU = | 1  2   1 |\n    | 0 -1   2 |\n    | 0  0  -12 |\n\nNext, we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   | 15 |\n| 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 35 |\n| 4  5  1 | | y3 |   | 25 |\n\n1. y1 = 15\n2. 2y1 + y2 = 35 => y2 = 35 - 2*15 = 5\n3. 4y1 + 5y2 + y3 = 25 => y3 = 25 - 4*15 - 5*5 = -25\n\ny = | 15 |\n    |  5 |\n    |-25 |\n\nFinally, we need to solve the system Ux = y for x:\n\n| 1  2   1 | | x |   | 15 |\n| 0 -1   2 | | y | = |  5 |\n| 0  0  -12| | z |   |-25 |\n\n1. -12z = -25 => z = -25 / -12 = 25/12\n2. -y + 2z = 5 => y = 2*(25/12) - 5 = 5/6\n3. x + 2y + z = 15 => x = 15 - 2*(5/6) - (25/12) = 5\n\nSo, the solution is x = 5, y = 5/6, and z = 25/12."
