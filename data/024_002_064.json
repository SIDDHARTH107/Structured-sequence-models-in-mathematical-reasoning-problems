    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its center coincides with the center of the sphere. Geodesics on the surface of a sphere are the shortest paths between two points, and they lie on great circles.\n\nLet's consider a sphere with radius r = 5 cm. The equation of the sphere in Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nTo find the geodesics, we need to find the great circles on the sphere. A great circle can be represented by the intersection of the sphere with a plane that passes through the center of the sphere (0, 0, 0).\n\nThe equation of a plane can be written as:\n\nAx + By + Cz + D = 0\n\nSince the plane passes through the center of the sphere (0, 0, 0), we have:\n\nA(0) + B(0) + C(0) + D = 0\nD = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the plane becomes:\n\nAx + By + Cz = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of the plane and the sphere. To do this, we can substitute the equation of the plane into the equation of the sphere:\n\n(Ax + By + Cz)^2 = 25\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nA^2x^2 + B^2y^2 + C^2z^2 + 2ABxy + 2ACxz + 2BCyz = 25\n\nThis equation represents the geodesics on the surface of the sphere. Since A, B, and C are arbitrary constants, there are infinitely many geodesics on the sphere. Each geodesic corresponds to a different great circle, and the shortest path between any two points on the sphere lies on one of these great circles."
