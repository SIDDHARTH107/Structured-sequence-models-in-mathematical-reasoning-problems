    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Sierpinski triangle, there are 3 self-similar pieces (the three smaller triangles), and the scaling factor is 3 (each smaller triangle has a side length of one-third the original triangle).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(3) / log(3) = 1.5849625007211563.\n\nThe exact Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.585."
