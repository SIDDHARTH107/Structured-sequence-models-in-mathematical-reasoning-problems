    "message_2": "To determine which of the groups of order 32 are isomorphic to the given groups, we will first list all possible groups of order 32 and then identify the ones that are isomorphic to the given groups.\n\nA group of order 32 has a prime order p = 2, and the number of groups of order p^n (where n is a positive integer) is given by the number of partitions of n. In this case, n = 5, and there are 7 partitions of 5: (5), (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1, 1), (2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1, 1, 1). This means there are 7 groups of order 32 up to isomorphism.\n\nNow, let's identify the groups isomorphic to the given groups:\n\n(a) The cyclic group C32:\nA cyclic group of order 32 has a single generator, and all its elements can be written as powers of this generator. There is only one such group, and it is the group with the partition (5), which corresponds to the group C32 itself. So, the group isomorphic to C32 is C32.\n\n(b) The dihedral group D16:\nThe dihedral group D16 has order 2 * 16 = 32. It is a non-abelian group and has a presentation of the form D16 = <r, s | r^16 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1)>. To find a group isomorphic to D16, we need to look for a non-abelian group of order 32 with a similar presentation. Among the 7 groups of order 32, the group with the partition (4, 1) has a presentation of the form <r, s | r^16 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1)>. Therefore, the group isomorphic to D16 is the group with the partition (4, 1).\n\n(c) The six non-abelian groups:\nWe have already found two non-abelian groups: D16 and the group with the partition (4, 1). We need to find four more non-abelian groups. The groups with partitions (3, 2), (3, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 1) are all non-abelian. The group with partition (3, 2) has a presentation of the form <r, s | r^8 = s^4 = 1, srs = r^(-1)>. The group with partition (3, 1, 1) has a presentation of the form <r, s, t | r^8 = s^2 = t^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1), trt = r^(-1)>. The group with partition (2, 2, 1) has a presentation of the form <r, s, t | r^4 = s^4 = t^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1), trt = r^(-1)>.\n\nSo, the six non-abelian groups of order 32 are D16, the group with partition (4, 1), the group with partition (3, 2), the group with partition (3, 1, 1), and the group with partition (2, 2, 1)."
