    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition between two firms. The leader firm can produce at a lower cost than the follower firm. The demand function for the product is given as Q = 120 – 2P. The leader firm can produce at a constant marginal cost of $20 per unit, while the marginal cost for the follower firm is $40. Determine the equilibrium quantity and price in the market.",
    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium quantity and price in the market, we need to find the reaction functions for both the leader and the follower firm. \n\nLet QL be the quantity produced by the leader firm and QF be the quantity produced by the follower firm. The total quantity in the market is Q = QL + QF. The demand function can be rewritten as P = 60 - 0.5Q.\n\nThe profit functions for the leader and the follower firm are as follows:\n\nπL = (P - MC_L) * QL = (60 - 0.5Q - 20) * QL = 40QL - 0.5QL^2 - 0.5QFQL\nπF = (P - MC_F) * QF = (60 - 0.5Q - 40) * QF = 20QF - 0.5QF^2 - 0.5QLQF\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit functions with respect to the quantities produced by each firm. We do this by taking the first-order partial derivatives with respect to QL and QF and setting them equal to zero.\n\n∂πL/∂QL = 40 - QL - 0.5QF = 0\n∂πF/∂QF = 20 - QF - 0.5QL = 0\n\nNow we can solve for the reaction functions:\n\nQL = 40 - 0.5QF\nQF = 20 - 0.5QL\n\nSubstitute the reaction function of the leader firm into the follower firm's reaction function:\n\nQF = 20 - 0.5(40 - 0.5QF)\nQF = 20 - 20 + 0.25QF\n0.75QF = 20\nQF = 20/0.75 = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nNow substitute the value of QF back into the leader firm's reaction function:\n\nQL = 40 - 0.5(80/3)\nQL = 40 - 40/3 = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nThe equilibrium quantities for both the leader and the follower firm are approximately 26.67 units. Now we can find the equilibrium price by substituting the total quantity into the demand function:\n\nP = 60 - 0.5(Q)\nP = 60 - 0.5(80/3 + 80/3)\nP = 60 - 0.5(160/3)\nP = 60 - 80/3 = 100/3 ≈ 33.33\n\nThe equilibrium price in the market is approximately $33.33."
