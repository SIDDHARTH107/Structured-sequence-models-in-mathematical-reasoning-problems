    "message_2": "No, this space is not a regular space. To show this, we will provide a counterexample.\n\nRecall that a topological space X is regular if for every closed set C and a point x ∈ X \\ C, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and C ⊆ V.\n\nConsider the closed set C = {c, d} and the point x = b. Note that x ∉ C. We will show that there are no disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and C ⊆ V.\n\nThe open sets containing x = b are {a, b} and X. If we choose U = {a, b}, then any open set V containing C must also contain b, since the only open set containing both c and d is X. If we choose U = X, then U and V cannot be disjoint, as V must contain all elements of X.\n\nThus, there are no disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and C ⊆ V, which means that the topological space X is not regular."
