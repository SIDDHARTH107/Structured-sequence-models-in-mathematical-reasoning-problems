    "message_2": "Let the number be x. According to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nTo solve this system, we first find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products: N1 = N/3 = 35, N2 = N/5 = 21, and N3 = N/7 = 15.\n\nNow, we find the modular inverses of these partial products:\n\n35 * a1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => a1 ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n21 * a2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => a2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n15 * a3 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => a3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can find the solution x using the formula:\n\nx = (2 * 35 * 2) + (3 * 21 * 1) + (4 * 15 * 1) = 140 + 63 + 60 = 263.\n\nHowever, we want the smallest positive integer, so we take the remainder of the division of x by N:\n\nx = 263 % 105 = 53.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible positive integer that satisfies all three conditions is 53."
