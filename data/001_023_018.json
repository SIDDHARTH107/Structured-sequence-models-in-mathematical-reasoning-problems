    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 0 in the interval [0, 2π], we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation in terms of sin(x) or cos(x) only.\n2. Find the values of x that satisfy the equation in the given interval.\n\nStep 1:\nWe can rewrite the equation as sin(x) = -cos(x). Then, divide both sides by cos(x):\n\nsin(x) / cos(x) = -1\n\nNow, we can use the identity tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x):\n\ntan(x) = -1\n\nStep 2:\nNow we need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy tan(x) = -1. We know that the tangent function has a period of π, so we can find the general solution for x:\n\nx = arctan(-1) + nπ, where n is an integer.\n\nx = (3π/4) + nπ\n\nNow, we can find the specific solutions in the interval [0, 2π]:\n\nFor n = 0, x = 3π/4 (which is in the interval [0, 2π])\n\nFor n = 1, x = 3π/4 + π = 7π/4 (which is in the interval [0, 2π])\n\nFor n > 1, the values of x will be greater than 2π, so they are not in the given interval.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 3π/4 and x = 7π/4."
