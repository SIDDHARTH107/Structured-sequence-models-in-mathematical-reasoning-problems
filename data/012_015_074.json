    "message_2": "The graph is connected. \n\nIn Graph Theory, a graph is considered connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices. In the given graph, we can find a path between any two vertices. For example, to go from A to H, we can follow the path A-B-C-D-H, and to go from E to G, we can follow the path E-F-G. Since there is a path between every pair of vertices, the graph is connected."
