    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 1 = 0, we can try to find its roots using various methods such as factoring, synthetic division, or numerical methods. In this case, the polynomial does not factor easily, so we will use a numerical method called the Rational Root Theorem to find an initial root.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. For our polynomial, the constant term is -1, and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of -1 are ±1, and the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2.\n\nTesting these possible roots:\n\nP(1) = 2(1)³ - 5(1)² + 3(1) - 1 = 2 - 5 + 3 - 1 = -1 ≠ 0\nP(-1) = 2(-1)³ - 5(-1)² + 3(-1) - 1 = -2 - 5 - 3 - 1 = -11 ≠ 0\nP(1/2) = 2(1/2)³ - 5(1/2)² + 3(1/2) - 1 = 1/4 - 5/4 + 3/2 - 1 = 0\n\nSo, x = 1/2 is a root of the polynomial. Now we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n      _________________________\n  1/2 |  2    -5     3    -1\n          1    -2     1\n      _________________________\n           2    -4     1    0\n```\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is 2x² - 4x + 1. To find the remaining roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -4, and c = 1:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)² - 4(2)(1))) / (2(2))\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 8)) / 4\nx = (4 ± √8) / 4\nx = (4 ± 2√2) / 4\nx = 1 ± (1/2)√2\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 1 = 0 are x = 1/2, x = 1 + (1/2)√2, and x = 1 - (1/2)√2."
