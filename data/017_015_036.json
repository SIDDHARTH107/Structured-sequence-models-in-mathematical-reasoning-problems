    "message_2": "To find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G, we will use Sylow's Theorems. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G. Then, according to Sylow's Theorems:\n\n1. n_p divides the order of G.\n2. n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nSince G has order 24, we can write it as 24 = 2^3 * 3. We are given that there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, so n_3 = 4. Now, we need to find n_2, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorems, we know that n_2 divides the order of G, so n_2 divides 24. The possible divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Also, n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2, which means n_2 = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nChecking the divisors of 24, we see that 1, 3, and 9 are congruent to 1 modulo 2. However, n_2 must also divide the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup in G, which is |G|/|Sylow 2-subgroup| = 24/8 = 3. Among the possible values for n_2, only 3 satisfies this condition.\n\nTherefore, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is n_2 = 3."
