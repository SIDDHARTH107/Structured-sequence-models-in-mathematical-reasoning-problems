    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 5x + 3, we will first find 5 points on the coordinate plane by plugging in different x values and calculating the corresponding y values.\n\n1. Let x = 0:\ny = 2(0)^2 - 5(0) + 3\ny = 3\nPoint: (0, 3)\n\n2. Let x = 1:\ny = 2(1)^2 - 5(1) + 3\ny = 2 - 5 + 3\ny = 0\nPoint: (1, 0)\n\n3. Let x = 2:\ny = 2(2)^2 - 5(2) + 3\ny = 8 - 10 + 3\ny = 1\nPoint: (2, 1)\n\n4. Let x = -1:\ny = 2(-1)^2 - 5(-1) + 3\ny = 2 + 5 + 3\ny = 10\nPoint: (-1, 10)\n\n5. Let x = -2:\ny = 2(-2)^2 - 5(-2) + 3\ny = 8 + 10 + 3\ny = 21\nPoint: (-2, 21)\n\nNow, we can plot these points on the coordinate plane and sketch the graph of the quadratic equation.\n\nUsing the graph, we can determine the following:\n\n1. x-intercepts: The x-intercepts are the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. From the graph, we can see that the x-intercepts are (1, 0) and (3, 0).\n\n2. y-intercept: The y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis. From the graph, we can see that the y-intercept is (0, 3).\n\n3. Vertex: The vertex is the highest or lowest point on the graph. In this case, the vertex is the lowest point, which is (1.25, -0.5).\n\n4. Axis of symmetry: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex and divides the graph into two equal halves. The equation for the axis of symmetry is x = h, where h is the x-coordinate of the vertex. In this case, the axis of symmetry is x = 1.25."
