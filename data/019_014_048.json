    "message_2": "We are given a higher-order logic expression and a specific set F. Let's break down the expression and evaluate its truth value for the given set F.\n\nExpression: ∀F [∃x (F(x)) → ∃y ∀z (F(z) → z ≤ y)]\n\nF is defined as the set of all natural numbers such that F(x) is true if and only if x is divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, let's consider the left side of the implication (→):\n\n∃x (F(x))\n\nSince F is the set of all natural numbers divisible by 3, there exists at least one natural number x (e.g., 3) such that F(x) is true. Therefore, the left side of the implication is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the right side of the implication:\n\n∃y ∀z (F(z) → z ≤ y)\n\nWe need to find a natural number y such that for all natural numbers z, if F(z) is true (i.e., z is divisible by 3), then z ≤ y.\n\nHowever, there is no such natural number y, because the set of natural numbers divisible by 3 is infinite (e.g., 3, 6, 9, ...). For any natural number y, we can always find a natural number z divisible by 3 such that z > y.\n\nTherefore, the right side of the implication is false.\n\nSince the left side of the implication is true and the right side is false, the entire expression evaluates to:\n\nTrue → False\n\nThis is a contradiction, so the truth value of the expression is False."
