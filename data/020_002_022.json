    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products: Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 2 hours of Machine X and 3 hours of Machine Y, whereas the production of Product B requires 4 hours of Machine X and 1 hour of Machine Y. The company has 60 hours of Machine X and 45 hours of Machine Y per day. Additionally, the profit earned on the production of Product A is $100 and that of Product B is $150. \n\nHow many units of each product should the company produce per day to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced per day.\n\nThe constraints for the machines' hours are:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 60 (Machine X)\n3x + y ≤ 45 (Machine Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 100x + 150y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 60\nDivide by 2:\nx + 2y ≤ 30\ny ≥ (30 - x) / 2\n\n2. 3x + y ≤ 45\ny ≤ 45 - 3x\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the following inequalities:\n\ny ≥ (30 - x) / 2\ny ≤ 45 - 3x\n\nNow we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1. x + 2y = 30\n2. 3x + y = 45\n\nSolve for x in equation 1:\nx = 30 - 2y\n\nSubstitute x in equation 2:\n3(30 - 2y) + y = 45\n90 - 6y + y = 45\n-5y = -45\ny = 9\n\nNow find x:\nx = 30 - 2(9)\nx = 12\n\nSo, the vertex of the feasible region is (12, 9).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at this vertex:\n\nP(12, 9) = 100(12) + 150(9) = 1200 + 1350 = $2550\n\nSince there's only one vertex in the feasible region, the company should produce 12 units of Product A and 9 units of Product B per day to maximize its profit, which will be $2550."
