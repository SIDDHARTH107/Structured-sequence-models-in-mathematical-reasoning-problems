    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = {{2 - λ, 1}, {4, 3 - λ}}\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\n|(A - λI)| = (2 - λ)(3 - λ) - (1)(4) = λ^2 - 5λ + 2\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ + 2 = 0\n\nBy factoring, we get:\n\n(λ - 2)(λ - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 3.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n\n(A - λ1I) * X = 0\n({{0, 1}, {4, 1}}) * {x1, x2} = {0, 0}\n\nFrom the first row, we get the equation:\n\n1 * x2 = 0 => x2 = 0\n\nFrom the second row, we get the equation:\n\n4 * x1 + 1 * x2 = 0 => 4 * x1 = 0 => x1 = 0\n\nHowever, this solution gives us the trivial eigenvector {0, 0}, which is not valid. This indicates that we made an error in our calculations.\n\nLet's go back and check our calculations for the characteristic equation. We have:\n\n|(A - λI)| = (2 - λ)(3 - λ) - (1)(4) = λ^2 - 5λ + 2 - 4 = λ^2 - 5λ - 2\n\nNow, we need to solve the corrected quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ - 2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nλ = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4(-2)))/2 = (5 ± √33)/2\n\nSo, the corrected eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + √33)/2 and λ2 = (5 - √33)/2.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = (5 + √33)/2:\n\n(A - λ1I) * X = 0\n({{-1/2 * √33 + 1/2, 1}, {4, -1/2 * √33 + 3/2}}) * {x1, x2} = {0, 0}\n\nFrom the first row, we get the equation:\n\n(-1/2 * √33 + 1/2) * x1 + x2 = 0\n\nLet x2 = 1, then x1 = (1/2 * √33 - 1/2)\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 is:\n\nv1 = {(1/2 * √33 - 1/2), 1}\n\nFor λ2 = (5 - √33)/2:\n\n(A - λ2I) * X = 0\n({{-1/2 * √33 - 1/2, 1}, {4, 1/2 * √33 + 3/2}}) * {x1, x2} = {0, 0}\n\nFrom the first row, we get the equation:\n\n(-1/2 * √33 - 1/2) * x1 + x2 = 0\n\nLet x2 = 1, then x1 = (1/2 * √33 + 1/2)\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 is:\n\nv2 = {(1/2 * √33 + 1/2), 1}\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + √33)/2 and λ2 = (5 - √33)/2, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = {(1/2 * √33 - 1/2), 1} and v2 = {(1/2 * √33 + 1/2), 1}."
