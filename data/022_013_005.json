    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the given analytic function, we will differentiate it with respect to z. The function is:\n\nf(z) = z^3 - (1 + i)z^2 + (2i - 1)z - 2i\n\nNow, let's differentiate each term with respect to z:\n\n1. The derivative of z^3 with respect to z is 3z^2.\n2. The derivative of (1 + i)z^2 with respect to z is 2(1 + i)z.\n3. The derivative of (2i - 1)z with respect to z is (2i - 1).\n4. The derivative of a constant, -2i, with respect to z is 0.\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) is:\n\nf'(z) = 3z^2 - 2(1 + i)z + (2i - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at the point z = 2 + i. We will substitute z = 2 + i into the derivative:\n\nf'(2 + i) = 3(2 + i)^2 - 2(1 + i)(2 + i) + (2i - 1)\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\n\n(2 + i)^2 = (2 + i)(2 + i) = 4 + 4i + i^2 = 4 + 4i - 1 = 3 + 4i\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression:\n\nf'(2 + i) = 3(3 + 4i) - 2(1 + i)(3 + 4i) + (2i - 1)\n\nNow, let's distribute and simplify:\n\nf'(2 + i) = 9 + 12i - 6 - 8i - 6i - 8i^2 + 2i - 1\nf'(2 + i) = 9 + 12i - 6 - 8i - 6i + 8 + 2i - 1\nf'(2 + i) = (9 - 6 + 8 - 1) + (12i - 8i - 6i + 2i)\nf'(2 + i) = 10 + 0i\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(z) at the point z = 2 + i is f'(2 + i) = 10."
