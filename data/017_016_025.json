    "message_2": "There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 27. Their corresponding structures are as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 27: C_27\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 9: C_3 × C_9\n3. Semidirect product of C_9 by C_3, where C_3 acts on C_9 by inversion: C_9 ⋊ C_3\n4. Semidirect product of C_3^2 by C_3, where C_3 acts on C_3^2 by permuting the factors: C_3^2 ⋊ C_3\n5. Direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3: C_3 × C_3 × C_3 (also denoted as C_3^3)\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic because they have different structures and cannot be transformed into one another by any isomorphism."
