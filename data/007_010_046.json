    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies all these conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let x be the integer we are looking for. We have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we need to find the product of the moduli: N = 3 × 5 × 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N/3 = 105/3 = 35\nN2 = N/5 = 105/5 = 21\nN3 = N/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\n\n35 * a1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => a1 ≡ 2 (mod 3) (since 35 * 2 = 70 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\n21 * a2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => a2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) (since 21 * 1 = 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\n15 * a3 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => a3 ≡ 1 (mod 7) (since 15 * 1 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nNow, we can find the solution x:\n\nx = (2 * 35 * 2) + (3 * 21 * 1) + (2 * 15 * 1) = 140 + 63 + 30 = 233\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is congruent to 233 modulo 105:\n\nx ≡ 233 (mod 105)\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies this congruence is:\n\nx = 233 - 2 * 105 = 233 - 210 = 23\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies all the given conditions is 23."
