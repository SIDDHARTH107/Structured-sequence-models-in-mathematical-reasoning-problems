    "message_2": "Kuratowski's theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to either K5 (the complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (the complete bipartite graph on two sets of 3 vertices).\n\nIn the given graph G, we can see that there are two sets of vertices, A = {a, b, c} and B = {x, y, z}, such that every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B. This forms a complete bipartite graph K3,3.\n\nTherefore, according to Kuratowski's theorem, the graph G is not planar."
