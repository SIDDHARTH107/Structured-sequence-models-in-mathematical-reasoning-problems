    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize cost of production for a particular product. The cost function is given by C(x,y) = 2x^2 + 5y^2 - xy - 5x - 20y, where x is the quantity of raw material 1 and y is the quantity of raw material 2 used in the production process. However, the production process requires at least 4 units of raw material 1 and 3 units of raw material 2. Find the minimum cost of production subject to these constraints.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of production, we need to find the critical points of the cost function C(x, y) and check if they satisfy the constraints x ≥ 4 and y ≥ 3. \n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of C(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\n∂C/∂x = 4x - y - 5\n∂C/∂y = 10y - x - 20\n\nNow, let's set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x and y:\n\n4x - y - 5 = 0\n10y - x - 20 = 0\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 4x - 5\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n10(4x - 5) - x - 20 = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n40x - 50 - x - 20 = 0\n39x = 70\nx = 70/39 ≈ 1.795\n\nNow, find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 4(70/39) - 5\ny = 280/39 - 195/39\ny = 85/39 ≈ 2.179\n\nHowever, these values of x and y do not satisfy the constraints x ≥ 4 and y ≥ 3. Therefore, the minimum cost does not occur at this critical point.\n\nNow, we need to check the minimum cost along the boundary of the constraint region. There are four cases to consider:\n\n1. x = 4 (minimum value of x) and y ≥ 3\n2. y = 3 (minimum value of y) and x ≥ 4\n3. x = 4 and y = 3 (minimum values of both x and y)\n4. x > 4 and y > 3 (interior of the constraint region)\n\nCase 1: x = 4\nC(4, y) = 2(4)^2 + 5y^2 - 4y - 5(4) - 20y\nC(4, y) = 32 + 5y^2 - 4y - 20 - 20y\nC(4, y) = 5y^2 - 24y + 12\n\nTo minimize C(4, y), we can take the derivative with respect to y and set it equal to zero:\n\n∂C(4, y)/∂y = 10y - 24\n10y - 24 = 0\ny = 24/10 = 2.4\n\nSince y ≥ 3, we need to use the minimum value of y, which is y = 3:\n\nC(4, 3) = 5(3)^2 - 24(3) + 12\nC(4, 3) = 45 - 72 + 12\nC(4, 3) = -15\n\nCase 2: y = 3\nC(x, 3) = 2x^2 + 5(3)^2 - 3x - 5x - 20(3)\nC(x, 3) = 2x^2 - 8x + 9\n\nTo minimize C(x, 3), we can take the derivative with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\n∂C(x, 3)/∂x = 4x - 8\n4x - 8 = 0\nx = 8/4 = 2\n\nSince x ≥ 4, we need to use the minimum value of x, which is x = 4:\n\nC(4, 3) = 2(4)^2 - 8(4) + 9\nC(4, 3) = 32 - 32 + 9\nC(4, 3) = 9\n\nCase 3: x = 4 and y = 3\nC(4, 3) = 2(4)^2 + 5(3)^2 - 4(3) - 5(4) - 20(3)\nC(4, 3) = 32 + 45 - 12 - 20 - 60\nC(4, 3) = -15\n\nCase 4: x > 4 and y > 3\nSince the cost function C(x, y) is a quadratic function with positive coefficients for the x^2 and y^2 terms, the cost will increase as x and y increase. Therefore, the minimum cost will not occur in the interior of the constraint region.\n\nComparing the costs for cases 1, 2, and 3, we find that the minimum cost of production is -15, which occurs when x = 4 and y = 3."
