    "message_1": "Let f(z) = z^2 - 2z - 1 be an analytic function in the complex plane. Determine the zeros and poles of f(z) and classify each according to their order.",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to solve the equation f(z) = 0:\n\nz^2 - 2z - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find its solutions:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-1))) / 2(1)\nz = (2 ± √(4 + 4)) / 2\nz = (2 ± √8) / 2\n\nSo the zeros of f(z) are:\n\nz = 1 + √2 and z = 1 - √2\n\nThese zeros are both simple zeros, as they are not repeated roots.\n\nNow, since f(z) is a polynomial function, it is entire, meaning it is analytic on the entire complex plane. Therefore, it has no poles. \n\nIn summary, f(z) has two simple zeros at z = 1 + √2 and z = 1 - √2, and it has no poles."
