    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern fractal is generated using four affine transformations with specific probabilities and scaling factors. The height of the entire fern is determined by the scaling factors in the transformation matrices. \n\nThe four transformations are as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (with a probability of 0.01):\n   | 0.00  0.00 |   | x |   | 0 |\n   |            | . |   | + |   |\n   | 0.00  0.16 |   | y |   | 0 |\n\n2. Transformation 2 (with a probability of 0.85):\n   |  0.85  0.04 |   | x |   | 0 |\n   |             | . |   | + |   |\n   | -0.04  0.85 |   | y |   | 1.6 |\n\n3. Transformation 3 (with a probability of 0.07):\n   |  0.20 -0.26 |   | x |   | 0 |\n   |             | . |   | + |   |\n   |  0.23  0.22 |   | y |   | 1.6 |\n\n4. Transformation 4 (with a probability of 0.07):\n   | -0.15  0.28 |   | x |   | 0 |\n   |             | . |   | + |   |\n   |  0.26  0.24 |   | y |   | 0.44 |\n\nGiven that the stem is one unit long and the height of the entire fern is 9 units, we can find the specific scaling ratio by analyzing the transformation that contributes the most to the height of the fern, which is Transformation 2.\n\nIn Transformation 2, the scaling factor for the y-coordinate is 0.85. Since the height of the entire fern is 9 units, and the stem is 1 unit long, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.85 * stem_length = total_height - stem_length\n\n0.85 * 1 = 9 - 1\n\n0.85 = 8\n\nThe specific scaling ratio used to generate the Barnsley fern fractal, given that the stem is one unit long and the height of the entire fern is 9 units, is 0.85."
