    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {3, 4, 6, 7}, find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the intersection of A with the resulting set. Next, find the symmetric difference of B and A, and then find the intersection of B with the resulting set. Show that the results of the two intersection operations are not the same, and therefore prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",

The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1, 5}\nB - A = {4, 6}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5} ∪ {4, 6} = {1, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A with the resulting set (A ∆ B).\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1, 3, 5, 7} ∩ {1, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A.\n\nB ∆ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B)\n\nB - A = {4, 6}\nA - B = {1, 5}\n\nB ∆ A = {4, 6} ∪ {1, 5} = {1, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B with the resulting set (B ∆ A).\n\nB ∩ (B ∆ A) = {3, 4, 6, 7} ∩ {1, 4, 5, 6} = {4, 6}\n\nAs we can see, the results of the two intersection operations are not the same:\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1, 5}\nB ∩ (B ∆ A) = {4, 6}\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
