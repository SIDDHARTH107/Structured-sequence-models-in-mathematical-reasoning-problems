The data collected is shown below:\n\nFertilizer 1: 12, 14, 16, 11\nFertilizer 2: 13, 10, 17, 12\nFertilizer 3: 14, 16, 15, 13\n\nUse ANOVA to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean heights of the plants using these fertilizers.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we need to calculate the following:\n\n1. The mean of each group (fertilizer)\n2. The overall mean of all the data\n3. The sum of squares within groups (SSW)\n4. The sum of squares between groups (SSB)\n5. The mean square within groups (MSW)\n6. The mean square between groups (MSB)\n7. The F-statistic\n8. Compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of each group\nFertilizer 1: (12 + 14 + 16 + 11) / 4 = 53 / 4 = 13.25\nFertilizer 2: (13 + 10 + 17 + 12) / 4 = 52 / 4 = 13\nFertilizer 3: (14 + 16 + 15 + 13) / 4 = 58 / 4 = 14.5\n\nStep 2: Calculate the overall mean\n(53 + 52 + 58) / 12 = 163 / 12 = 13.5833\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW)\nSSW = Σ(Σ(x_ij - mean_i)^2)\nFor Fertilizer 1: (12-13.25)^2 + (14-13.25)^2 + (16-13.25)^2 + (11-13.25)^2 = 1.5625 + 0.5625 + 7.5625 + 5.0625 = 14.75\nFor Fertilizer 2: (13-13)^2 + (10-13)^2 + (17-13)^2 + (12-13)^2 = 0 + 9 + 16 + 1 = 26\nFor Fertilizer 3: (14-14.5)^2 + (16-14.5)^2 + (15-14.5)^2 + (13-14.5)^2 = 0.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5\nSSW = 14.75 + 26 + 5 = 45.75\n\nStep 4: Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB)\nSSB = Σ(n_i * (mean_i - overall_mean)^2)\nFor Fertilizer 1: 4 * (13.25 - 13.5833)^2 = 4 * 0.1103 = 0.4412\nFor Fertilizer 2: 4 * (13 - 13.5833)^2 = 4 * 0.3389 = 1.3556\nFor Fertilizer 3: 4 * (14.5 - 13.5833)^2 = 4 * 0.8417 = 3.3668\nSSB = 0.4412 + 1.3556 + 3.3668 = 5.1636\n\nStep 5: Calculate the mean square within groups (MSW)\nMSW = SSW / (total number of observations - number of groups) = 45.75 / (12 - 3) = 45.75 / 9 = 5.0833\n\nStep 6: Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB)\nMSB = SSB / (number of groups - 1) = 5.1636 / (3 - 1) = 5.1636 / 2 = 2.5818\n\nStep 7: Calculate the F-statistic\nF = MSB / MSW = 2.5818 / 5.0833 = 0.5079\n\nStep 8: Compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table\nUsing an alpha level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom for the numerator (df1 = number of groups - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2) and denominator (df2 = total number of observations - number of groups = 12 - 3 = 9), we find the critical value from the F-distribution table to be 4.256.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (0.5079) is less than the critical value (4.256), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is no significant difference in the mean heights of the plants using these fertilizers."
