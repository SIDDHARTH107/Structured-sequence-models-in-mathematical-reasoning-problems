    "message_1": "A group of 10 students agree to contribute money towards a public good. Each student has an initial endowment of $50. The total amount required for the public good is $500. The students decide to use the following rule for contributing: each student contributes 20% of their endowment and the total contributions are pooled. What is the total amount of money that the students will have for the public good?",
    "message_2": "Each student has an initial endowment of $50 and contributes 20% of their endowment. So, each student contributes:\n\n$50 * 0.20 = $10\n\nThere are 10 students, so the total amount of money contributed by all students is:\n\n$10 * 10 = $100\n\nThus, the total amount of money that the students will have for the public good is $100."
