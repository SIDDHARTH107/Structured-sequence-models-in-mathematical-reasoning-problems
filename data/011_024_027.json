The units of products that can be manufactured in each factory and the demands of each warehouse are given in the table below:\n\n| Factory | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A       | 200       | 150       | 150       |\n| B       | 100       | 150       | 200       |\n| C       | 150       | 200       | 100       |\n\n| Warehouse | Demand for Product 1 | Demand for Product 2 | Demand for Product 3 |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| W1        | 100                 | 100                 | 100                 |\n| W2        | 150                 | 150                 | 150                 |\n| W3        | 200                 | 150                 | 100                 |\n\nAssuming that the transportation cost per unit of product between each factory and each warehouse is uniform, what is the least cost to supply the demand of each warehouse from the available supply of each factory?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the transportation cost, we should try to fulfill the demand of each warehouse using the nearest factory. Since the transportation cost per unit of product is uniform, we can focus on minimizing the number of units transported.\n\nFirst, let's fulfill the demand for Product 1:\n- Factory A can supply 100 units to Warehouse W1 and 100 units to Warehouse W2.\n- Factory B can supply the remaining 50 units to Warehouse W2.\n- Factory C can supply 150 units to Warehouse W3.\n\nNow, let's fulfill the demand for Product 2:\n- Factory A can supply 100 units to Warehouse W1 and 50 units to Warehouse W3.\n- Factory B can supply 150 units to Warehouse W2.\n- Factory C can supply the remaining 100 units to Warehouse W3.\n\nFinally, let's fulfill the demand for Product 3:\n- Factory A can supply 100 units to Warehouse W1 and 50 units to Warehouse W2.\n- Factory B can supply the remaining 100 units to Warehouse W2 and 100 units to Warehouse W3.\n- Factory C can supply the remaining 50 units to Warehouse W3.\n\nIn total, we have the following distribution:\n\n| Factory | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A       | 200       | 150       | 150       |\n| B       | 100       | 150       | 200       |\n| C       | 150       | 200       | 100       |\n\n| Warehouse | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| W1        | 100 (A)   | 100 (A)   | 100 (A)   |\n| W2        | 100 (A), 50 (B) | 150 (B) | 100 (A), 50 (B) |\n| W3        | 150 (C)   | 50 (A), 100 (C) | 100 (B), 50 (C) |\n\nThe total number of units transported is 450 for Product 1, 450 for Product 2, and 450 for Product 3, resulting in 1350 units transported. Since the transportation cost per unit is uniform, the least cost to supply the demand of each warehouse from the available supply of each factory is proportional to the number of units transported, which is 1350 times the uniform transportation cost per unit."
