    "message_2": "Since the complex manifold M is isomorphic to the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, we can compute the first Chern class of M by computing the first Chern class of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$.\n\nRecall that the first Chern class of a complex manifold is a cohomology class that measures the curvature of a complex line bundle over the manifold. In the case of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, we consider the tautological line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(-1)$, which is the dual of the hyperplane bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\nThe first Chern class of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ is given by the first Chern class of the tautological line bundle, denoted as $c_1(\\mathcal{O}(-1))$. To compute this, we can use the fact that the first Chern class is additive under tensor product of line bundles:\n\n$c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1) \\otimes \\mathcal{O}(-1)) = c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)) + c_1(\\mathcal{O}(-1))$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{O}(1) \\otimes \\mathcal{O}(-1)$ is the trivial line bundle, its first Chern class is zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)) + c_1(\\mathcal{O}(-1)) = 0$.\n\nNow, we know that the first Chern class of the hyperplane bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the positive generator of the second cohomology group $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Let's denote this generator by $h$. Then, we have:\n\n$c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)) = h$.\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n$h + c_1(\\mathcal{O}(-1)) = 0$.\n\nThus, the first Chern class of the tautological line bundle is:\n\n$c_1(\\mathcal{O}(-1)) = -h$.\n\nSince M is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, the first Chern class of M is also given by $-h$."
