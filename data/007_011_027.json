    "message_2": "The quadratic residues of a prime number p are the numbers that are congruent to a perfect square modulo p. In other words, a number x is a quadratic residue modulo p if there exists an integer y such that x ≡ y^2 (mod p).\n\nFor the prime number 5, we can find the quadratic residues by checking the squares of the numbers from 1 to (5-1)/2, which is 1 and 2 in this case, and then taking their residues modulo 5.\n\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues of 5 are 1 and 4."
