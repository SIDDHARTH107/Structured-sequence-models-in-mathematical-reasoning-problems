    "message_2": "To determine the wave speed, wavelength, and frequency of the wave, we need to analyze the given wave equation:\n\ny(x,t) = 0.04sin(2π(50t - x/10))\n\nThis equation is in the form of a sinusoidal wave equation:\n\ny(x,t) = A sin(2π(ft - kx))\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, f is the frequency, and k is the wave number.\n\nFrom the given equation, we can identify the following:\n\nA = 0.04 m (amplitude)\nf = 50 Hz (frequency)\nk = 1/10 m⁻¹ (wave number)\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength (λ) using the relationship between the wave number (k) and the wavelength:\n\nk = 2π/λ\n\nSolving for λ:\n\nλ = 2π/k = 2π/(1/10) = 20π m\n\nSo, the wavelength (λ) is 20π meters.\n\nNext, we can find the wave speed (v) using the relationship between frequency (f) and wavelength (λ):\n\nv = fλ\n\nSubstituting the values of f and λ:\n\nv = 50 Hz * 20π m = 1000π m/s\n\nSo, the wave speed (v) is 1000π meters per second.\n\nIn summary, the wave has the following properties:\n\nWave speed (v) = 1000π m/s\nWavelength (λ) = 20π m\nFrequency (f) = 50 Hz"
