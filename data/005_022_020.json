    "message_2": "To calculate the median, 25th percentile, and outlier boundaries using Tukey's method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the dataset in ascending order: 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 100.\n\n2. Find the median (50th percentile): Since there are 11 observations, the median is the 6th value, which is 6.\n\n3. Find the 25th percentile (Q1): Since there are 11 observations, the 25th percentile is the average of the 3rd and 4th values, which is (3+4)/2 = 3.5.\n\n4. Find the 75th percentile (Q3): Similarly, the 75th percentile is the average of the 8th and 9th values, which is (8+9)/2 = 8.5.\n\n5. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 8.5 - 3.5 = 5.\n\n6. Determine the outlier boundaries using Tukey's method: Lower boundary = Q1 - 1.5*IQR = 3.5 - 1.5*5 = -4. Upper boundary = Q3 + 1.5*IQR = 8.5 + 1.5*5 = 16.\n\nSo, the median is 6, the 25th percentile is 3.5, and the outlier boundaries are -4 and 16. In this dataset, the value 100 is an outlier as it is outside the outlier boundaries."
