    "message_2": "To find the poles of the function f(z) = (3z - 2)/(z - 1), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero. \n\nSetting the denominator equal to zero, we have:\n\nz - 1 = 0\nz = 1\n\nSo, there is a pole at z = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue at this pole. Since the pole is of order 1 (a simple pole), we can use the following formula for the residue:\n\nRes(f, z0) = lim (z -> z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\nIn our case, z0 = 1. So, we have:\n\nRes(f, 1) = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (3z - 2)/(z - 1)]\n\nThe (z - 1) terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nRes(f, 1) = lim (z -> 1) (3z - 2)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit as z approaches 1:\n\nRes(f, 1) = 3(1) - 2 = 1\n\nSo, the residue at the pole z = 1 is 1. \n\nIn summary, the function f(z) has a pole at z = 1 with residue 1."
