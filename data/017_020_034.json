    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct conjugacy classes in G, we will use the class equation. The class equation is given by:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nwhere |G| is the order of the group, |Z(G)| is the order of the center of the group, and the sum is taken over one representative x from each distinct conjugacy class, with C(x) being the centralizer of x in G.\n\nSince |G| = 40, we have:\n\n40 = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G.\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C40 (the cyclic group of order 40), then G is abelian, and its center is the whole group. Thus, |Z(G)| = 40, and there is only one conjugacy class (the whole group itself).\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to D20 (the dihedral group of order 40), then G is non-abelian. In this case, the center of G is trivial, i.e., |Z(G)| = 1. The conjugacy classes in D20 are as follows: one class for the identity, 19 classes of order 2 (corresponding to the 20 reflections), and two classes of order 20 (corresponding to the 20 rotations). Thus, there are 1 + 19 + 2 = 22 distinct conjugacy classes in D20.\n\n3. If G is one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40, then G is non-abelian, and its center is non-trivial. In this case, |Z(G)| > 1. Since the sum of the orders of the conjugacy classes must be 40, and the sum must be a multiple of the orders of the centralizers, it follows that the number of distinct conjugacy classes in G must be greater than 22.\n\nNow, we can use the information about the number of distinct conjugacy classes to determine whether G is isomorphic to C40, D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\nIf G has only one conjugacy class, then G is isomorphic to C40.\n\nIf G has 22 conjugacy classes, then G is isomorphic to D20.\n\nIf G has more than 22 conjugacy classes, then G is isomorphic to one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C40, D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40, we need to find the number of distinct conjugacy classes in G and compare it with the numbers 1, 22, and greater than 22."
