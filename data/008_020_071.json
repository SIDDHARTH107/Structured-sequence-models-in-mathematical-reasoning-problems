    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix notation and inverse matrix, we first represent the system as AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 5  6  7 |\n    | 8  9 10 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 14 |\n    | 32 |\n    | 45 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A_inv. If A_inv exists, we can multiply both sides of the equation AX = B by A_inv to get X = A_inv * B, which will give us the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 2(6*10 - 7*9) - 3(5*10 - 7*8) + 4(5*9 - 6*8)\n       = 2(60 - 63) - 3(50 - 56) + 4(45 - 48)\n       = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 4(-3)\n       = -6 + 18 - 12\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the inverse of A does not exist. Therefore, we cannot use the inverse matrix method to solve this system of linear equations. The system is either inconsistent (no solution) or dependent (infinitely many solutions)."
