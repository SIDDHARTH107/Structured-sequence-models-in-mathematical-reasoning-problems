    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum sample size required to estimate the population mean with a given confidence interval and margin of error, we can use the formula:\n\nn = (Z * σ / E)^2\n\nwhere:\nn = sample size\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96)\nσ = population standard deviation (2.5 in this case)\nE = margin of error (0.5 in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nn = (1.96 * 2.5 / 0.5)^2\nn = (9.8 / 0.5)^2\nn = 19.6^2\nn ≈ 384.16\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a sample, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum sample size required is 385."
