    "message_2": "To find the impulse response of the network, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of the transfer function H(jω). The impulse response is given by h(t) = F^(-1){H(jω)}, where F^(-1) denotes the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nH(jω) = (2jω + 3)/(ω^2 + 4jω + 3)\n\nFirst, we need to simplify the transfer function by performing partial fraction decomposition. To do this, we need to find the roots of the denominator:\n\nω^2 + 4jω + 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in ω. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nω = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4j, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nω = (-4j ± √((4j)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nω = (-4j ± √(-16 + 12)) / 2\nω = (-4j ± √(-4)) / 2\nω = (-4j ± 2j) / 2\n\nThe roots are ω1 = -2j and ω2 = -1j. Now we can perform the partial fraction decomposition:\n\nH(jω) = A / (ω - ω1) + B / (ω - ω2)\n\nwhere A and B are constants. Multiplying both sides by the denominator, we get:\n\n2jω + 3 = A(ω - ω2) + B(ω - ω1)\n\nPlugging in ω1 = -2j, we can solve for A:\n\n2j(-2j) + 3 = A(-2j - ω2)\nA = (4 - 3) / (-2j - (-1j))\nA = 1 / (-j)\n\nSimilarly, plugging in ω2 = -1j, we can solve for B:\n\n2j(-1j) + 3 = B(-1j - ω1)\nB = (2 - 3) / (-1j - (-2j))\nB = -1 / j\n\nNow we have:\n\nH(jω) = (1 / (-j)) / (ω - (-2j)) + (-1 / j) / (ω - (-1j))\n\nNow we can find the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω):\n\nh(t) = F^(-1){(1 / (-j)) / (ω - (-2j))} + F^(-1){(-1 / j) / (ω - (-1j))}\n\nUsing the inverse Fourier transform property for exponentials:\n\nh(t) = (1 / (-j)) * e^(-2jt) + (-1 / j) * e^(-jt)\n\nh(t) = -e^(-2jt) + e^(-jt)\n\nSo, the impulse response of the network is:\n\nh(t) = -e^(-2jt) + e^(-jt)"
