    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Bell number, which is a number that counts the number of different ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets. The Bell number B(n) can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = Î£[k=0 to n-1] C(n-1, k) * B(k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n\nFor a set of 7 elements, we want to find B(7). Using the recurrence relation:\n\nB(7) = C(6,0) * B(0) + C(6,1) * B(1) + C(6,2) * B(2) + C(6,3) * B(3) + C(6,4) * B(4) + C(6,5) * B(5) + C(6,6) * B(6)\n\nFirst, we need to find the Bell numbers for B(0) to B(6):\n\nB(0) = 1 (by definition)\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\nB(6) = 203\n\nNow, we can calculate the binomial coefficients:\n\nC(6,0) = 1\nC(6,1) = 6\nC(6,2) = 15\nC(6,3) = 20\nC(6,4) = 15\nC(6,5) = 6\nC(6,6) = 1\n\nFinally, we can plug these values into the recurrence relation:\n\nB(7) = 1 * 1 + 6 * 1 + 15 * 2 + 20 * 5 + 15 * 15 + 6 * 52 + 1 * 203\nB(7) = 1 + 6 + 30 + 100 + 225 + 312 + 203\nB(7) = 877\n\nSo, there are 877 different ways to partition a set of 7 elements into non-empty subsets."
