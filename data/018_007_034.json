    "message_2": "Let A be a set containing 3 elements, i.e., A = {a, b, c}. The size of A, denoted as |A|, is 3.\n\nThe power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. In this case, P(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}.\n\nThe size of the power set of A, denoted as |P(A)|, is the number of elements in P(A). In this case, |P(A)| = 8.\n\nNow, let's prove that the size of the power set of A is always larger than the size of A itself. For any set A with n elements, the size of its power set is 2^n. This is because each element can either be included or not included in a subset, resulting in 2 choices for each element. Therefore, there are 2^n possible subsets in the power set of A.\n\nSince the size of A is n and the size of P(A) is 2^n, we need to show that 2^n > n for all n ≥ 0.\n\nBase case: For n = 0, 2^0 = 1 > 0.\n\nInductive step: Assume that 2^k > k for some k ≥ 0. We need to show that 2^(k+1) > k + 1.\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k > 2 * k (since 2^k > k by the inductive hypothesis)\n\nNow, we need to show that 2 * k > k + 1. This is equivalent to showing that k > 1, which is true for all k ≥ 2.\n\nThus, by mathematical induction, the size of the power set of A is always larger than the size of A itself for all n ≥ 0."
