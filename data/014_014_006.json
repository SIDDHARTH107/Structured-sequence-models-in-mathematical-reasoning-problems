    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MEET ME AFTER SCHOOL\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATH\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATH\n2. Fill the matrix with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, as I and J are treated as the same letter in the Playfair cipher):\n\n   M  A  T  H  B\n   C  D  E  F  G\n   I  K  L  N  O\n   P  Q  R  S  U\n   V  W  X  Y  Z\n\n3. Split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters) and adjust if needed:\n\n   ME  ET  ME  AF  TE  RS  CH  OO  L\n\n4. Encrypt each digraph using the Playfair matrix:\n\n   - ME -> CF\n   - ET -> TH\n   - ME -> CF\n   - AF -> MC\n   - TE -> HD\n   - RS -> SL\n   - CH -> YK\n   - OO -> UU\n   - L -> Add an extra letter (e.g., X) to make a digraph: LX -> LY\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message:\n\n   CF TH CF MC HD SL YK UU LY\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"CFTHCFMCHDSLYKUULY\"."
