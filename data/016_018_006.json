    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set obtained by removing the middle third of a line segment repeatedly, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces (the two remaining line segments after removing the middle third) and the scaling factor is r = 3 (since each remaining segment is 1/3 the length of the previous segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThis value is the same for the Cantor set obtained after any number of iterations, including 6 times, as the process of removing the middle third is self-similar and the Hausdorff dimension remains constant."
