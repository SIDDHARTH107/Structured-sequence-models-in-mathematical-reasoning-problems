    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can tell you that determining the exact number of Calabi-Yau manifolds with specific Hodge numbers is a difficult and open problem in mathematics. Calabi-Yau manifolds are complex, compact, and Ricci-flat manifolds that play a significant role in string theory and algebraic geometry.\n\nThe Hodge numbers h^{1,1} and h^{2,1} are topological invariants of the Calabi-Yau manifold, and they are related to the number of moduli (parameters) that describe the manifold's complex structure and KÃ¤hler structure.\n\nThere is no known formula or method to directly compute the number of Calabi-Yau manifolds with specific Hodge numbers. However, mathematicians have discovered and classified many examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds with various Hodge numbers through algebraic geometry and other techniques.\n\nIn summary, it is not possible to provide an exact number of Calabi-Yau manifolds with Hodge numbers h^{1,1} = h^{2,1} = 3, as this is an open problem in mathematics."
