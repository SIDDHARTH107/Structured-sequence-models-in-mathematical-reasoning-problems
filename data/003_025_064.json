    "message_1": "A boat is traveling north at a speed of 10 m/s. A current is also flowing towards the northeast at a speed of 5 m/s. Find the magnitude and direction of the boat's resulting velocity. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's resulting velocity, we can use vector addition. We can break down the boat's velocity and the current's velocity into their respective x and y components.\n\nBoat's velocity (Vb):\n- Northward direction, so it has no x component and a y component of 10 m/s.\nVbx = 0 m/s\nVby = 10 m/s\n\nCurrent's velocity (Vc):\n- Northeastward direction, so it has equal x and y components.\nVcx = 5 m/s (eastward)\nVcy = 5 m/s (northward)\n\nNow, we can add the x and y components of the boat's velocity and the current's velocity to find the resulting velocity (Vr).\n\nVrx = Vbx + Vcx = 0 + 5 = 5 m/s\nVry = Vby + Vcy = 10 + 5 = 15 m/s\n\nNow that we have the x and y components of the resulting velocity, we can find the magnitude and direction.\n\nMagnitude:\nVr = sqrt(Vrx^2 + Vry^2) = sqrt(5^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(25 + 225) = sqrt(250) ≈ 15.81 m/s\n\nDirection:\nθ = arctan(Vry / Vrx) = arctan(15 / 5) = arctan(3)\nθ ≈ 71.57 degrees (measured from the eastward direction, counter-clockwise)\n\nSo, the boat's resulting velocity has a magnitude of approximately 15.81 m/s and a direction of approximately 71.57 degrees from the eastward direction, counter-clockwise (or north of east)."
