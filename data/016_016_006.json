    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a space-filling curve that is constructed using a recursive process. The perimeter of the Gosper curve increases with each order, and it can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nPerimeter = (length of initial segment) * (number of segments)\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the length of the initial segment is 1, and the number of segments can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of segments = 7^n, where n is the order of the curve.\n\nFor a Gosper curve of order 5, the number of segments is:\n\nNumber of segments = 7^5 = 16807\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the Gosper curve of order 5 is:\n\nPerimeter = (length of initial segment) * (number of segments) = 1 * 16807 = 16807 units."
