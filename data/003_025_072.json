    "message_1": "A car is travelling at 60 km/h towards north. There is a wind blowing towards the east with a speed of 20 km/h. What is the direction and magnitude of the resultant velocity of the car? Use trigonometry to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet Vc be the velocity of the car (60 km/h north), Vw be the velocity of the wind (20 km/h east), and Vr be the resultant velocity.\n\nFirst, we'll find the magnitude of the resultant velocity (Vr) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nVr^2 = Vc^2 + Vw^2\nVr^2 = (60 km/h)^2 + (20 km/h)^2\nVr^2 = 3600 + 400\nVr^2 = 4000\nVr = sqrt(4000)\nVr ≈ 63.25 km/h\n\nNow, we'll find the direction of the resultant velocity using trigonometry. We can use the tangent function to find the angle (θ) between the north direction and the resultant velocity:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(θ) = Vw / Vc\ntan(θ) = 20 km/h / 60 km/h\ntan(θ) = 1/3\n\nNow, we'll find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arctan(1/3)\nθ ≈ 18.43°\n\nSo, the resultant velocity of the car is approximately 63.25 km/h in a direction 18.43° east of north."
