    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = 3x^2 - 5x + 7 at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ny'(x) = d(3x^2 - 5x + 7)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\ny'(x) = 6x - 5\n\nNow, we need to evaluate y'(x) at x = 2:\n\ny'(2) = 6(2) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 7."
