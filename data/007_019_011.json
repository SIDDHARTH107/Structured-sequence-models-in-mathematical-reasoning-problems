    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime number that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers in exactly 4 ways, we can start by listing the prime numbers and checking their sums. \n\nPrime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, ...\n\nLet's start checking the sums:\n\n1. 7 (2+5) - only 1 way\n2. 11 (2+9) - only 1 way\n3. 13 (2+11) - only 1 way\n4. 17 (2+15, 7+10) - 2 ways\n5. 19 (2+17) - only 1 way\n6. 23 (2+21, 5+18, 7+16) - 3 ways\n7. 29 (2+27, 5+24, 11+18, 13+16) - 4 ways\n\nThe smallest prime number that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers in exactly 4 ways is 29. The 4 ways are:\n\n1. 29 = 2 + 27\n2. 29 = 5 + 24\n3. 29 = 11 + 18\n4. 29 = 13 + 16"
