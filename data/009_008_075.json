    "message_1": "A good question for a math student to solve related to wave propagation and wave equations might be:\n\nA tsunami wave travels at a speed of 200 m/s and has a height of 15 meters. If the wave is modeled by the wave equation y(t,x) = Acos(kx - wt), where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, w is the angular frequency and y is the displacement, what is the angular frequency of the wave?",
    "message_2": "To find the angular frequency (w) of the tsunami wave, we need to use the wave speed equation:\n\nv = w/k\n\nwhere v is the wave speed, w is the angular frequency, and k is the wave number.\n\nWe are given the wave speed (v) as 200 m/s. However, we need to find the wave number (k) before we can solve for the angular frequency (w).\n\nThe wave number (k) can be found using the equation:\n\nk = 2π/λ\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the wave. Unfortunately, the wavelength is not provided in the problem. Without the wavelength, we cannot find the wave number (k) and subsequently the angular frequency (w).\n\nIf more information about the wavelength or wave number is provided, we can proceed to find the angular frequency of the tsunami wave."
