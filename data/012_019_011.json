    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph, denoted by Δ(G). Since there are 12 edges in the graph, the maximum degree cannot be more than 12/2 = 6. However, if the maximum degree were 6, then the sum of the degrees of all vertices would be at least 6 * 9 = 54, which is not possible since the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (i.e., 2 * 12 = 24). Therefore, the maximum degree must be less than 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the maximum degree is 5. In this case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices would be at least 5 * 9 = 45, which is still greater than 24. Therefore, the maximum degree must be less than 5.\n\nIf the maximum degree is 4, then the sum of the degrees of all vertices would be at least 4 * 9 = 36, which is still greater than 24. Therefore, the maximum degree must be less than 4.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where the maximum degree is 3. In this case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices would be at least 3 * 9 = 27, which is greater than 24. However, it is possible to have a graph with 9 vertices, 12 edges, and a maximum degree of 3. For example, consider a graph with three disjoint triangles connected by a central vertex. This graph has 9 vertices, 12 edges, and a maximum degree of 3.\n\nNow that we know the maximum degree is 3, we can use Vizing's theorem to find the chromatic index. Vizing's theorem states that for any graph G, Δ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1. Since Δ(G) = 3, we have 3 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 4.\n\nIn this case, it is possible to properly color the edges of the graph with 3 colors. For example, consider the graph with three disjoint triangles connected by a central vertex mentioned earlier. We can color the edges of each triangle with two colors, and then use a third color for the edges connecting the central vertex to the triangles. Therefore, the chromatic index of the graph is χ'(G) = 3."
