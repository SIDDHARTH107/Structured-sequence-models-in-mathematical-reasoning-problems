The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A △ B) and C.\n\nC = {2, 5}\n(A △ B) ∪ C = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union.
