    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 8051, we can start by testing the smallest prime numbers as potential factors. We can begin with 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on.\n\n8051 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.\n\nNow, let's check if it is divisible by 3:\n\n8051 รท 3 = 2683.666...\n\nSince the result is not a whole number, 8051 is not divisible by 3.\n\nNext, let's check if it is divisible by 5:\n\n8051 ends with a 1, which means it is not divisible by 5.\n\nNow, let's check if it is divisible by 7:\n\n8051 รท 7 = 1150.142857...\n\nSince the result is not a whole number, 8051 is not divisible by 7.\n\nWe can continue checking prime numbers, and we find that:\n\n8051 รท 11 = 731\n\nSince 8051 is divisible by 11 and the result is a whole number, the smallest prime factor of 8051 is 11."
