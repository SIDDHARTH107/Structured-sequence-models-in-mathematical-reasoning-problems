    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p).\n\nWe are given the condition (n-1) ≡ -1 (mod n). Since the condition is similar to Wilson's theorem, we can suspect that n is a prime number. Let's test the smallest prime numbers:\n\nFor n = 2, (2-1) ≡ -1 (mod 2) => 1 ≡ 1 (mod 2), which is true.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer value of n that satisfies the given condition is n = 2."
