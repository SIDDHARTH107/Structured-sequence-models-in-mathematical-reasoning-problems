    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 5  6  7 |\n    | 8  9 10 |\n\nb = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n    | 3 |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a method of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R:\n\nQ = |  0.1826   0.2236  -0.9565 |\n    |  0.4565   0.6708   0.2892 |\n    |  0.7304  -0.7071   0.0000 |\n\nR = | 10.9545   12.7279   14.5014 |\n    |  0.0000    1.3416    2.6832 |\n    |  0.0000    0.0000   -0.9565 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system Rx = Q^T * b.\n\nFirst, calculate Q^T * b:\n\nQ^T * b = | -0.1826 |\n          |  1.7889 |\n          | -1.7391 |\n\nNow, solve the system Rx = Q^T * b using back-substitution:\n\n| 10.9545   12.7279   14.5014 | | x |   | -0.1826 |\n|  0.0000    1.3416    2.6832 | | y | = |  1.7889 |\n|  0.0000    0.0000   -0.9565 | | z |   | -1.7391 |\n\nFrom the last row, we have -0.9565z = -1.7391, which gives z = 1.8182.\n\nNow, substitute z back into the second row: 1.3416y + 2.6832(1.8182) = 1.7889, which gives y = -2.0000.\n\nFinally, substitute y and z back into the first row: 10.9545x + 12.7279(-2.0000) + 14.5014(1.8182) = -0.1826, which gives x = 1.0000.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1.0000\ny = -2.0000\nz = 1.8182"
