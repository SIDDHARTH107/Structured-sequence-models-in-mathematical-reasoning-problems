    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference (△) between the set (A × B) and set A. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\n(A × B) △ A = (A × B ∪ A) - (A × B ∩ A)\n\nSince A contains only single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty:\n\nA × B ∩ A = ∅\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference is just the union of the two sets:\n\n(A × B) △ A = A × B ∪ A = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)} ∪ {1, 2, 3}\n\nSo, the value of (A × B) △ A is:\n\n{(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), 1, 2, 3}"
