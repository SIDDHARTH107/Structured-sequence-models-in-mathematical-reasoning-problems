    "message_2": "Liouville's theorem states that if a function is entire (holomorphic on the entire complex plane) and bounded, then it must be constant. However, the function f(z) = z^3 - 6z^2 + 11z - 6 is a polynomial of degree 3 and is not constant. Therefore, it does not satisfy the conditions of Liouville's theorem.\n\nTo determine the number of zeros that f(z) has in the complex plane, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that a polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots, counting multiplicities. Since f(z) is a polynomial of degree 3, it has exactly 3 complex roots."
