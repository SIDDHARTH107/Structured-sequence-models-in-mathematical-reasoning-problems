    "message_2": "There are 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 24. Their structures are as follows:\n\n1. Z_24 (cyclic group of order 24)\n2. Z_12 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_3\n4. Z_6 × Z_4\n5. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2\n6. Z_3 × (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2)\n7. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 (direct product of six Z_2's)\n8. S_3 × Z_4 (semi-direct product of S_3 and Z_4)\n9. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_2 (semi-direct product of S_3 and Z_2 × Z_2)\n10. S_4 (symmetric group on 4 elements)\n11. A_4 × Z_2 (direct product of the alternating group A_4 and Z_2)\n12. Q_8 × Z_3 (direct product of the quaternion group Q_8 and Z_3)\n13. D_12 (dihedral group of order 12)\n14. D_6 × Z_2 (direct product of dihedral group D_6 and Z_2)\n15. SL(2,3) (special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements)\n\nThese groups can be found using the Sylow theorems and considering the possible structures of groups of order 24."
