    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the sphere is 12 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 6 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(6)^3\nV = (4/3)π(216)\nV = (4)(3.14159)(72)\nV = 904.77872 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately 904.78 cubic centimeters."
