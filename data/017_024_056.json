    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 96: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Determine the divisors of 96: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96\n3. Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order p^n * q^m, where p and q are distinct primes, and n and m are their respective powers: G(p^n * q^m) = (p^(2n) - p^n) * (q^(2m) - q^m) / (p^n - p^(n-1)) * (q^m - q^(m-1))\n\nFor our case, p = 2, n = 5, q = 3, and m = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nG(2^5 * 3^1) = (2^(10) - 2^5) * (3^(2) - 3^1) / (2^5 - 2^4) * (3^1 - 3^0)\nG(96) = (1024 - 32) * (9 - 3) / (32 - 16) * (3 - 1)\nG(96) = 992 * 6 / 16 * 2\nG(96) = 5952 / 32\nG(96) = 186\n\nTherefore, there are 186 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
