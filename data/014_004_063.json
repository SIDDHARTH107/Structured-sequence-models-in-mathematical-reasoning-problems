    "message_2": "To find the private key of Bob, we need to find the scalar (integer) k such that k * G = (5, 1), where G is the generator point of the elliptic curve over the finite field of order 23.\n\nFirst, we need to find the generator point G. We can do this by trying different points on the curve until we find one with order 23. The order of a point is the smallest positive integer n such that n * P = O, where O is the point at infinity (the identity element for the elliptic curve).\n\nWe can use the following addition rules for elliptic curves:\n\n1. If P = O or Q = O, then P + Q = P or Q, respectively.\n2. If P = -Q (i.e., they are reflections across the x-axis), then P + Q = O.\n3. If P â‰  -Q, then P + Q = R, where R is the point that is the reflection of the intersection of the line through P and Q with the curve.\n\nLet's start by checking the point (5, 1) as a potential generator point:\n\n1 * (5, 1) = (5, 1)\n2 * (5, 1) = (6, 19)\n3 * (5, 1) = (20, 14)\n4 * (5, 1) = (15, 17)\n5 * (5, 1) = (9, 16)\n6 * (5, 1) = (7, 6)\n7 * (5, 1) = (17, 20)\n8 * (5, 1) = (0, 1)\n9 * (5, 1) = (16, 5)\n10 * (5, 1) = (4, 5)\n11 * (5, 1) = (10, 6)\n12 * (5, 1) = (12, 17)\n13 * (5, 1) = (3, 10)\n14 * (5, 1) = (18, 7)\n15 * (5, 1) = (13, 10)\n16 * (5, 1) = (2, 3)\n17 * (5, 1) = (8, 7)\n18 * (5, 1) = (19, 20)\n19 * (5, 1) = (14, 9)\n20 * (5, 1) = (21, 20)\n21 * (5, 1) = (11, 16)\n22 * (5, 1) = (1, 22)\n23 * (5, 1) = O\n\nSince 23 * (5, 1) = O, the point (5, 1) has order 23 and can be used as the generator point G.\n\nNow, we need to find the private key k such that k * G = (5, 1). Since G = (5, 1), we have:\n\nk * (5, 1) = (5, 1)\n\nThis means that k = 1. Therefore, the private key of Bob is 1."
