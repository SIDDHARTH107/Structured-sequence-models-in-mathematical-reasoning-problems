    "message_2": "To compute the Cartesian product of two sets, we form ordered pairs with the elements from the first set as the first component and the elements from the second set as the second component.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nWe can see that the elements in A × B and B × A are different. For example, (1, 4) is in A × B but not in B × A, and (4, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B. Therefore, A × B ≠ B × A, proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
