    "message_2": "To evaluate the given complex integral, we can use Cauchy's integral formula. First, let's rewrite the integrand as a product of two analytic functions:\n\n$$f(z) = (z^2 + 4z) e^{2z}$$\n\nNow, let's find the singularities of the function $f(z)$. The function $e^{2z}$ is analytic everywhere, so we only need to find the singularities of the function $z^2 + 4z$. This function has two singularities at $z = 0$ and $z = -4$. Since the contour $\\gamma$ is a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin, only the singularity at $z = 0$ is inside the contour.\n\nNow, let's find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z = 0$. To do this, we can use the following formula for the residue of a function $f(z)$ at a simple pole $z = z_0$:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), z_0) = \\lim_{z \\to z_0} (z - z_0) f(z)$$\n\nIn our case, $z_0 = 0$, so we have:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 0) = \\lim_{z \\to 0} (z - 0) (z^2 + 4z) e^{2z} = \\lim_{z \\to 0} z(z + 4) e^{2z}$$\n\nSince $e^{2z}$ is nonzero for all $z$, we can evaluate the limit by simply evaluating the polynomial part:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} z(z + 4) = 0$$\n\nThus, the residue of $f(z)$ at $z = 0$ is 0.\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral:\n\n$$\\oint\\limits_{\\gamma} f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\sum \\text{Res}(f(z), z_k)$$\n\nSince the only singularity inside the contour is at $z = 0$ and its residue is 0, the sum is just 0. Therefore, the integral is:\n\n$$\\oint\\limits_{\\gamma} (z^2 + 4z) e^{2z} \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot 0 = 0$$"
