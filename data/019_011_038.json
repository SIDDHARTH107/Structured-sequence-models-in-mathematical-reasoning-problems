    "message_2": "In classical logic, the truth value of the statement \"P → Q\" (P implies Q) can be determined using the following truth table:\n\nP | Q | P → Q\nT | T |   T\nT | F |   F\nF | T |   T\nF | F |   T\n\nSince P is false and Q is true (F | T), the truth value of the statement \"P → Q\" is true."
