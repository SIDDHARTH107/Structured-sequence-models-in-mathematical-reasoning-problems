    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 2, we can start by testing different values of n:\n\nFor n = 2, 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3, which is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 2 is 3."
