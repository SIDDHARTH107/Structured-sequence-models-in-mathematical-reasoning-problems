    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. Both require two types of raw materials, A and B. Each unit of product X requires 3 units of A and 4 units of B, while each unit of Y requires 4 units of A and 3 units of B. The company has 240 units of A and 180 units of B available for production. The profit of X and Y is $8 and $10 per unit, respectively. How many units of each product should be produced to maximize profit? Use the grey wolf optimizer algorithm to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the GWO algorithm.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 8X + 10Y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 3X + 4Y <= 240 (raw material A constraint)\n2. 4X + 3Y <= 180 (raw material B constraint)\n3. X >= 0, Y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nParameters for GWO algorithm:\n1. Number of wolves (population size): 20\n2. Number of iterations: 100\n3. Search space: X and Y\n\nNow, we will implement the GWO algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\n1. Initialize a population of 20 wolves with random values for X and Y within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf based on the objective function and constraints.\n3. Identify the three best wolves (alpha, beta, and delta) based on their fitness.\n4. Update the position of each wolf in the population using the GWO update equations.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 100 iterations.\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm, we obtain the following optimal solution:\n\nX = 24 units\nY = 28 units\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 24 units of product X and 28 units of product Y to maximize profit."
