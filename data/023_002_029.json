    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients, which are given by the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\naₙ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x) cos(nx) dx\nbₙ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x) sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x^2 is an even function, all bₙ coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the a₀ and aₙ coefficients.\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\na₀ = (1/π) [(x^3)/3] | from -π to π\na₀ = (1/π) [(π^3)/3 - (-π^3)/3]\na₀ = (2π^2)/3\n\nNow, let's find the aₙ coefficients:\n\naₙ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] x^2 cos(nx) dx\n\nIntegration by parts:\nu = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/n) sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\naₙ = (1/π) [(x^2 * (1/n) sin(nx)) | from -π to π - ∫[-π, π] (1/n) sin(nx) * 2x dx]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, the first term becomes zero:\n\naₙ = (1/π) [- (2/n) ∫[-π, π] x sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we need to integrate x sin(nx) dx. We'll use integration by parts again:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\naₙ = (1/π) [- (2/n) (-(x/n) cos(nx) | from -π to π + (1/n^2) ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx)]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n for all integer values of n, the first term becomes zero:\n\naₙ = (1/π) [- (2/n) (1/n^2) ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx]\n\nThe integral of cos(nx) over the interval -π to π is zero:\n\naₙ = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π is:\n\nf(x) = (a₀/2) + Σ[0 * cos(nx)]\n\nf(x) = (π^2)/3\n\nSince the Fourier series converges to a constant value, (π^2)/3, it does not converge pointwise to the original function f(x) = x^2 on the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π. However, it converges in the mean square sense, which means that the average squared difference between the original function and its Fourier series converges to zero."
