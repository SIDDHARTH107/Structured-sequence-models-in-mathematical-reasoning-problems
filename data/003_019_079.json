    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of f(x) = 2sin(3x) + 3cos(4x) between the limits of pi and 0, we first need to find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe antiderivative of 2sin(3x) is:\n\n∫2sin(3x) dx = (-2/3)cos(3x) + C₁\n\nThe antiderivative of 3cos(4x) is:\n\n∫3cos(4x) dx = (3/4)sin(4x) + C₂\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivative of the entire function:\n\n∫(2sin(3x) + 3cos(4x)) dx = (-2/3)cos(3x) + (3/4)sin(4x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of pi and 0:\n\nF(pi) = (-2/3)cos(3pi) + (3/4)sin(4pi)\nF(0) = (-2/3)cos(0) + (3/4)sin(0)\n\ncos(3pi) = -1\nsin(4pi) = 0\ncos(0) = 1\nsin(0) = 0\n\nF(pi) = (-2/3)(-1) + (3/4)(0) = 2/3\nF(0) = (-2/3)(1) + (3/4)(0) = -2/3\n\nNow, we can find the definite integral:\n\n∫(2sin(3x) + 3cos(4x)) dx from 0 to pi = F(pi) - F(0) = (2/3) - (-2/3) = 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3\n\nSo, the definite integral of f(x) = 2sin(3x) + 3cos(4x) between the limits of pi and 0 is 4/3."
