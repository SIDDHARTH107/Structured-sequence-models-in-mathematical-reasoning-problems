    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 10 units is heated from one end to a constant temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. Find the temperature distribution along the rod using Fourier series if the other end is kept at 0 degrees Celsius. The thermal conductivity of the rod is 5 units per second and the density of the metal is 8 units per cubic meter. The specific heat capacity of the metal is 20 units per Kelvin.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the rod, we need to solve the one-dimensional heat equation using Fourier series. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = k * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and k is the thermal diffusivity. The thermal diffusivity can be calculated as:\n\nk = K / (ρ * c)\n\nwhere K is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat capacity. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nk = 5 / (8 * 20) = 5 / 160 = 1/32\n\nNow, we need to find the steady-state temperature distribution, which means ∂T/∂t = 0. So, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n0 = (1/32) * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nT(x) = A * x + B\n\nWe have boundary conditions: T(0) = 100 and T(10) = 0. Plugging these values into the general solution, we get:\n\n100 = A * 0 + B => B = 100\n0 = A * 10 + 100 => A = -10\n\nSo, the steady-state temperature distribution is:\n\nT(x) = -10x + 100\n\nNow, we can represent this function as a Fourier series:\n\nT(x) = a0/2 + Σ[an * cos(nπx/L) + bn * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (10 units), and a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients. Since the temperature distribution is an odd function, the cosine terms will be zero. We can find the Fourier coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na0 = (2/L) * ∫[T(x) * 1]dx from 0 to L\nan = 0 (since the cosine terms are zero)\nbn = (2/L) * ∫[T(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L\n\nCalculating a0:\n\na0 = (2/10) * ∫[-10x + 100]dx from 0 to 10\na0 = (1/5) * [-5x² + 100x] from 0 to 10\na0 = (1/5) * [-5(10)² + 100(10)] = 0\n\nCalculating bn:\n\nbn = (2/10) * ∫[(-10x + 100) * sin(nπx/10)]dx from 0 to 10\n\nWe can use integration by parts to solve this integral:\n\nu = -10x + 100, dv = sin(nπx/10)dx\ndu = -10dx, v = -(10/nπ) * cos(nπx/10)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\nbn = (1/5) * [(-10x + 100) * (-(10/nπ) * cos(nπx/10)) - ∫(-10 * (-(10/nπ) * cos(nπx/10))dx] from 0 to 10\n\nbn = (1/5) * [(100/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1) + (100/n²π²) * (sin(nπ) - 0)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\nbn = (1/5) * (100/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the temperature distribution:\n\nT(x) = Σ[(1/5) * (100/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nπx/10)]\n\nThis series represents the temperature distribution along the rod as a function of position x."
