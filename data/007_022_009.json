    "message_1": "Suppose we have an elliptic curve defined over the finite field GF(37) given by the equation: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2. If we choose the point P = (1,6) on the curve, what is the order of this point (i.e., how many times can we add P to itself before it becomes the point at infinity)?",
    "message_2": "To find the order of the point P = (1,6), we will repeatedly add P to itself until we reach the point at infinity. We will use the point addition and point doubling formulas for elliptic curves.\n\nLet's start by finding 2P:\n\nSince we are doubling the point P, we will use the point doubling formula:\nλ = (3x₁^2 + a) / (2y₁) mod p\nν = (y₁ - λx₁) - λx₂ mod p\n\nHere, a = 2 (from the equation of the elliptic curve), p = 37, x₁ = 1, and y₁ = 6.\n\nλ = (3(1)^2 + 2) / (2(6)) mod 37\nλ = (3 + 2) / 12 mod 37\nλ = 5 / 12 mod 37\nλ = 5 * 12^(-1) mod 37\nλ = 5 * 3 mod 37 (since 12^(-1) mod 37 = 3)\nλ = 15 mod 37\n\nν = (6 - 15(1)) - 15(1) mod 37\nν = -9 - 15 mod 37\nν = 13 mod 37\n\nSo, 2P = (15, 13).\n\nNow, let's find 3P by adding P and 2P:\n\nWe will use the point addition formula:\nλ = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁) mod p\nν = (y₁ - λx₁) - λx₂ mod p\n\nHere, x₂ = 15 and y₂ = 13.\n\nλ = (13 - 6) / (15 - 1) mod 37\nλ = 7 / 14 mod 37\nλ = 7 * 14^(-1) mod 37\nλ = 7 * 19 mod 37 (since 14^(-1) mod 37 = 19)\nλ = 133 mod 37\nλ = 22 mod 37\n\nν = (6 - 22(1)) - 22(15) mod 37\nν = -16 - 330 mod 37\nν = 5 mod 37\n\nSo, 3P = (22, 5).\n\nNow, let's find 4P by adding 2P and 2P:\n\nWe will use the point doubling formula again, this time with x₁ = 15 and y₁ = 13.\n\nλ = (3(15)^2 + 2) / (2(13)) mod 37\nλ = (3(225) + 2) / 26 mod 37\nλ = (675 + 2) / 26 mod 37\nλ = 677 / 26 mod 37\nλ = 677 * 26^(-1) mod 37\nλ = 677 * 32 mod 37 (since 26^(-1) mod 37 = 32)\nλ = 21664 mod 37\nλ = 6 mod 37\n\nν = (13 - 6(15)) - 6(15) mod 37\nν = -87 - 90 mod 37\nν = 4 mod 37\n\nSo, 4P = (6, 4).\n\nNow, let's find 5P by adding P and 4P:\n\nWe will use the point addition formula with x₂ = 6 and y₂ = 4.\n\nλ = (4 - 6) / (6 - 1) mod 37\nλ = -2 / 5 mod 37\nλ = -2 * 5^(-1) mod 37\nλ = -2 * 15 mod 37 (since 5^(-1) mod 37 = 15)\nλ = -30 mod 37\nλ = 7 mod 37\n\nν = (6 - 7(1)) - 7(6) mod 37\nν = -1 - 42 mod 37\nν = 30 mod 37\n\nSo, 5P = (7, 30).\n\nNow, let's find 6P by adding 3P and 3P:\n\nWe will use the point doubling formula again, this time with x₁ = 22 and y₁ = 5.\n\nλ = (3(22)^2 + 2) / (2(5)) mod 37\nλ = (3(484) + 2) / 10 mod 37\nλ = (1452 + 2) / 10 mod 37\nλ = 1454 / 10 mod 37\nλ = 1454 * 10^(-1) mod 37\nλ = 1454 * 22 mod 37 (since 10^(-1) mod 37 = 22)\nλ = 31988 mod 37\nλ = 0 mod 37\n\nSince λ = 0, we have reached the point at infinity.\n\nThus, the order of the point P = (1,6) is 6."
