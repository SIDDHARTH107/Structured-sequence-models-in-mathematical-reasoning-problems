    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', is given by:\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nSince A = {1, 2, 3}, the complement of A (A') will be:\n\nA' = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. \n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's compare the union of A and A' with the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nSince A ∪ A' = U, we have shown that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
