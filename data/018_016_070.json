    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)}\n\nNow, let's find the unions (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B):\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)} and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)}. Both sets are equal, and they contain the same elements.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the individual Cartesian products A × B and B × A are not equal:\n\nA × B = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2)}\n\nB × A = {(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)}\n\nThese two sets have different elements, so the Cartesian product is not commutative. The question statement is incorrect in claiming that they are not equal and therefore not commutative with respect to union. The correct statement should be that the Cartesian product itself is not commutative."
