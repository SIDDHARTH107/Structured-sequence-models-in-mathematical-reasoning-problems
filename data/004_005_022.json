    "message_2": "To find the particular solution of the differential equation y' = 2x that satisfies the initial condition y(0) = 3, we first need to find the general solution of the differential equation.\n\nThe given differential equation is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫y'(x) dx = ∫2x dx\n\nLet's integrate both sides:\n\ny(x) = x^2 + C\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the constant C that satisfies the initial condition y(0) = 3. Plug in the initial condition into the general solution:\n\n3 = (0)^2 + C\n\n3 = C\n\nSo, the particular solution of the differential equation that satisfies the initial condition is:\n\ny(x) = x^2 + 3"
