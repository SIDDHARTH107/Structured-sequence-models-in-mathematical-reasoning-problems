Comparing this to A × B and B × A, we can see that the intersection is not equal to either of the Cartesian products:\n\n(A × B) ∩ (B × A) ≠ A × B, since {(2,2), (3,3)} ≠ {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\n(A × B) ∩ (B × A) ≠ B × A, since {(2,2), (3,3)} ≠ {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nSince the intersection of A × B and B × A is not equal to either A × B or B × A, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection."
