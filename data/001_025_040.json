    "message_2": "To solve the complex number equation (3 + 2i)x - (5 + i) = (2 - 4i)x + 6 - 3i, we first need to simplify the equation and isolate x.\n\n(3 + 2i)x - (5 + i) = (2 - 4i)x + 6 - 3i\n\nNow, we'll move all the terms with x to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:\n\n(3 + 2i)x - (2 - 4i)x = 6 - 3i + 5 + i\n\nCombine the x terms and the constants:\n\n[(3 + 2i) - (2 - 4i)]x = 11 - 2i\n\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\n(3 + 2i - 2 + 4i)x = 11 - 2i\n\n(1 + 6i)x = 11 - 2i\n\nNow, we'll isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by (1 + 6i):\n\nx = (11 - 2i) / (1 + 6i)\n\nTo get rid of the complex number in the denominator, we'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 - 6i):\n\nx = [(11 - 2i)(1 - 6i)] / [(1 + 6i)(1 - 6i)]\n\nMultiply the numerators and denominators:\n\nx = (11 - 66i - 2i + 12i^2) / (1 - 36i^2)\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can replace i^2 with -1:\n\nx = (11 - 66i - 2i - 12) / (1 + 36)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nx = (-1 - 68i) / 37\n\nNow, we have the solution for x:\n\nx = -1/37 - 68i/37"
