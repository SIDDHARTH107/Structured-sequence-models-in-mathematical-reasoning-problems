    "message_2": "To form a committee of 5 people from a group of 10 people, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (10 in this case), k is the number of people to be chosen (5 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, in this case, we have:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 ways to form a committee of 5 people from a group of 10 people when the order of the committee members does not matter."
