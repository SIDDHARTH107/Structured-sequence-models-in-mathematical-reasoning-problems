    "message_1": "A certain type of environmental event occurs at a rate of 0.05 per year in a particular region. What is the probability that this event will occur at least once in the next 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a fixed average rate of occurrence (λ).\n\nIn this case, the average rate of occurrence (λ) is 0.05 events per year. We want to find the probability that the event will occur at least once in the next 10 years.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability that the event will not occur at all in the next 10 years. This is equivalent to finding the probability of 0 events occurring in the next 10 years.\n\nThe Poisson distribution formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time period\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average rate of occurrence (0.05 events per year in this case)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (0 events in this case)\n\nSince we want to find the probability for a 10-year period, we need to adjust the average rate of occurrence (λ) accordingly:\n\nλ = 0.05 events per year * 10 years = 0.5 events in 10 years\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.5) * 0.5^0) / 0! = (0.60653 * 1) / 1 = 0.60653\n\nThe probability that the event will not occur at all in the next 10 years is approximately 0.60653.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the event will occur at least once in the next 10 years. This is equal to 1 minus the probability that the event will not occur at all:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.60653 = 0.39347\n\nThe probability that the event will occur at least once in the next 10 years is approximately 0.39347 or 39.35%."
