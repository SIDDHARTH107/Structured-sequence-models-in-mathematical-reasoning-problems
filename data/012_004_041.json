    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. (B,C,1)\n2. (A,B,2)\n3. (D,E,3)\n4. (A,D,4)\n5. (C,D,5)\n6. (B,E,7)\n7. (E,A,8)\n\nNow, we add edges to the minimum spanning tree while making sure not to form any cycles:\n\n1. Add (B,C,1) to the minimum spanning tree.\n2. Add (A,B,2) to the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add (D,E,3) to the minimum spanning tree.\n4. We cannot add (A,D,4) because it would form a cycle with (A,B,2) and (D,E,3).\n5. Add (C,D,5) to the minimum spanning tree.\n\nAt this point, we have included all 5 vertices in the minimum spanning tree, so we can stop.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree consists of the edges:\n\n- (B,C,1)\n- (A,B,2)\n- (D,E,3)\n- (C,D,5)\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11."
