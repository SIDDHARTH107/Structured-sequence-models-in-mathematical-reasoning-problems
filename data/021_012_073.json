    "message_2": "The quasi-Newton method is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum or maximum of a function. It is an iterative method that uses an approximation of the Hessian matrix to update the solution. However, since we are dealing with a cubic function, we can use calculus to find the minimum value directly.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative of the function f(x) to determine the critical points:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, we set the first derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 11 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -12, and c = 11. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (12 ± √((-12)^2 - 4 * 3 * 11)) / (2 * 3)\nx = (12 ± √(144 - 132)) / 6\nx = (12 ± √12) / 6\n\nThis gives us two critical points:\n\nx1 = (12 + √12) / 6 ≈ 2.79\nx2 = (12 - √12) / 6 ≈ 1.21\n\nNow we need to determine if these critical points are minima, maxima, or neither. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(x1) = 6 * 2.79 - 12 ≈ 4.74 > 0\nf''(x2) = 6 * 1.21 - 12 ≈ -4.74 < 0\n\nSince f''(x1) > 0, x1 is a local minimum, and since f''(x2) < 0, x2 is a local maximum. Since we are looking for the minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 5], we also need to check the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 6 * 0^2 + 11 * 0 - 6 = -6\nf(5) = 5^3 - 6 * 5^2 + 11 * 5 - 6 = -6\n\nNow we compare the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints:\n\nf(x1) ≈ 2.79^3 - 6 * 2.79^2 + 11 * 2.79 - 6 ≈ -0.04\nf(x2) ≈ 1.21^3 - 6 * 1.21^2 + 11 * 1.21 - 6 ≈ 4.96\n\nThe minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 5] is f(x1) ≈ -0.04, which occurs at x ≈ 2.79, accurate to two decimal places."
