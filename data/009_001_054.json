    "message_2": "To find a mathematical model for the population, we can use the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P0 * 2^(t/T)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, t is the time in hours, and T is the time it takes for the population to double.\n\nIn this case, P0 = 1000 and T = 5 hours. So the formula becomes:\n\nP(t) = 1000 * 2^(t/5)\n\nTo determine the size of the population after 10 hours, we can plug t = 10 into the formula:\n\nP(10) = 1000 * 2^(10/5)\nP(10) = 1000 * 2^2\nP(10) = 1000 * 4\nP(10) = 4000\n\nSo, the size of the population after 10 hours will be 4000 bacteria."
