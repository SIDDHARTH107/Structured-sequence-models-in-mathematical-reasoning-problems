So,\n\nC = 7^11 mod 91\n\nC = 1977326743 mod 91\n\nC = 49\n\nNow, the encrypted message is 49.\n\nTo decrypt the encrypted message using the RSA private key (91, 23), we use the formula:\n\nM = C^d mod n\n\nwhere C is the encrypted message, d is the decryption exponent, and n is the modulus.\n\nIn this case, C = 49, d = 23, and n = 91. So,\n\nM = 49^23 mod 91\n\nM = 153931627906489048643 mod 91\n\nM = 7\n\nSo, the decrypted message is 7, which is the original message."
