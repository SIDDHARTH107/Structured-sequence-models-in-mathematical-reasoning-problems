    "message_2": "The first bifurcation value of the logistic map occurs when the system transitions from a stable fixed point to a period-2 orbit. To find this value, we need to analyze the stability of the fixed point.\n\nLet's find the fixed point(s) by setting $x_{n+1} = x_n = x$:\n\n$x = rx(1-x)$\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n$x(1-r) = -rx^2$\n\nNow, we have two fixed points:\n\n1. $x = 0$\n2. $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$\n\nWe will analyze the stability of the second fixed point, as the first one is trivial. To do this, we need to find the derivative of the logistic map function with respect to x:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(rx(1-x)) = r - 2rx$\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at the fixed point $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$:\n\n$r - 2r\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) = r - 2r + 2 = 3 - r$\n\nThe fixed point loses its stability when the absolute value of the derivative is greater than 1:\n\n$|3 - r| > 1$\n\nSolving for r, we find the first bifurcation value:\n\n$r < 2$ or $r > 4$\n\nSince we are looking for the first bifurcation value, we choose the smallest value:\n\n$r = 2$\n\nSo, the first bifurcation value of the logistic map is 2.000."
