    "message_2": "To find the minimum total distance, we need to assign each destination to the depot with the shortest distance, while making sure that each depot serves no more than 3 destinations. We can do this by sorting the distances for each destination and then assigning them to the depots accordingly.\n\n1. Destination 1: Depot 2 (4)\n2. Destination 2: Depot 3 (6)\n3. Destination 3: Depot 1 (5)\n4. Destination 4: Depot 1 (3)\n5. Destination 5: Depot 4 (7)\n6. Destination 6: Depot 2 (4)\n7. Destination 7: Depot 5 (5)\n8. Destination 8: Depot 3 (5)\n9. Destination 9: Depot 1 (3)\n10. Destination 10: Depot 3 (3)\n11. Destination 11: Depot 4 (5)\n12. Destination 12: Depot 1 (2)\n13. Destination 13: Depot 4 (3)\n14. Destination 14: Depot 4 (7)\n15. Destination 15: Depot 2 (4)\n\nNow, let's add up the distances for each depot:\n\nDepot 1: 3 + 2 + 5 = 10\nDepot 2: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12\nDepot 3: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\nDepot 4: 7 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 22\nDepot 5: 5\n\nThe minimum total distance the company needs to travel to service all destinations is 10 + 12 + 14 + 22 + 5 = 63."
