    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will analyze the properties of the elements in G.\n\nFirst, let's check if G is cyclic. A group is cyclic if there exists an element that generates the entire group. In other words, if there exists an element x in G such that {x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3} = {e, a, b, c}.\n\nWe can see that:\n- a^2 = e, so the powers of a are {a^0, a^1, a^2} = {e, a}, which does not generate the entire group.\n- b^2 = e, so the powers of b are {b^0, b^1, b^2} = {e, b}, which does not generate the entire group.\n- c^2 = e, so the powers of c are {c^0, c^1, c^2} = {e, c}, which does not generate the entire group.\n\nSince no element generates the entire group, G is not cyclic and therefore not isomorphic to C4.\n\nNow, let's check if G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. The Klein four-group V4 has the following properties:\n1. It has one identity element (e).\n2. Every element has order 2, i.e., x^2 = e for all x in V4.\n3. It is not cyclic.\n\nWe already know that G is not cyclic and has an identity element e. Let's check if every element in G has order 2:\n\n- a^2 = e\n- b^2 = e\n- c^2 = e\n\nAll elements in G have order 2, so G satisfies all the properties of the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4."
