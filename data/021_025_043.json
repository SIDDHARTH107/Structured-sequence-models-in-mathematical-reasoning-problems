    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, for this quadratic function, we can easily find the minimum value using calculus. \n\nTo find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 5, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 4\n\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n\n6x + 4 = 0\nx = -2/3\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value by plugging this x value back into the original function:\n\nf(-2/3) = 3(-2/3)^2 + 4(-2/3) + 5\nf(-2/3) = 3(4/9) - 8/3 + 5\nf(-2/3) = 4/3 + 5\nf(-2/3) = 19/3\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 5 in the domain [-10, 10] is 19/3 or approximately 6.333."
