    "message_1": "The base of a trapezoid is 12 cm, the height is 8 cm, and the length of the shorter parallel side is 6 cm. Find the area of the trapezoid.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are the base (12 cm) and the shorter parallel side (6 cm), and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 6) * 8\n\nArea = (1/2) * (18) * 8\n\nArea = 9 * 8\n\nArea = 72 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 72 square centimeters."
