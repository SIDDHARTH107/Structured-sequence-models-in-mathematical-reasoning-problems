The company can produce up to 100 widgets per day. The demand function for the widgets is given by P=250-2Q, where P is the price per widget and Q is the quantity sold per day. The company wants to maximize its profit. What is the optimal number of widgets that the company should produce and sell per day?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of widgets to produce and sell per day, we need to find the profit function and then maximize it. \n\nFirst, let's find the revenue function. Revenue is the product of price and quantity (R = P * Q). We are given the demand function P = 250 - 2Q. So, the revenue function is:\n\nR(Q) = P * Q = (250 - 2Q) * Q = 250Q - 2Q^2\n\nNext, let's find the cost function. We are given that the cost of raw materials is $10 per widget. The problem does not provide information on how many hours of labor are required to produce a widget, so we cannot include the labor cost in our calculations. Therefore, the cost function is:\n\nC(Q) = 10Q\n\nNow, we can find the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue and cost functions:\n\nProfit(Q) = R(Q) - C(Q) = (250Q - 2Q^2) - 10Q = -2Q^2 + 240Q\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dQ = -4Q + 240 = 0\n\nSolving for Q:\n\nQ = 240 / 4 = 60\n\nSo, the company should produce and sell 60 widgets per day to maximize its profit."
