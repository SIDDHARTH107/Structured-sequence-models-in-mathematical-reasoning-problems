    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by -3. This means that the second and third equations do not provide any new information, and the system is essentially just one equation with three variables:\n\nx + 2y + z = 0\n\nTo find the solutions to this equation, we can express one variable in terms of the other two. For example, let's express x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = -2y - z\n\nNow, we can choose any values for y and z, and we will get a corresponding value for x that satisfies the equation. The solutions to this system of equations are therefore given by:\n\nx = -2y - z\n\nwhere y and z can be any real numbers. This represents an infinite number of solutions, as there are infinitely many combinations of y and z that will satisfy the equation."
