    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the linear system |D|, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a smooth algebraic curve X of genus g and a divisor D on X, the dimension of the linear system |D| is given by:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g + l(K - D),\n\nwhere K is the canonical divisor on X, and l(K - D) is the dimension of the linear system |K - D|.\n\nIn our case, the genus g = 3, and the degree of the divisor D is 5. The canonical divisor K has degree 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4.\n\nNow we need to find l(K - D). Since deg(K - D) = deg(K) - deg(D) = 4 - 5 = -1, we know that l(K - D) = 0, because the degree of K - D is negative.\n\nUsing the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g + l(K - D) = 5 + 1 - 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the linear system |D| is 3."
