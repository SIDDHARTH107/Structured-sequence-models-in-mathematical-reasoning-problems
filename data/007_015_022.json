    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1000, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that 2^p - 1 > 1000.\n\nWe can start by testing prime numbers greater than 10 (since 2^10 = 1024, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 1000):\n\n- If p = 11, 2^11 - 1 = 2047, which is not prime (23 * 89 = 2047).\n- If p = 13, 2^13 - 1 = 8191, which is a prime number.\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1000 is 8191."
