    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required, we can use the concept of graph theory and the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn a graph with maximum degree Δ (the maximum number of edges incident to a single vertex), the chromatic number is at most Δ + 1. This is because, in the worst case, a vertex with Δ neighbors will need a different color from each of its neighbors, and then it will need its own color.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree Δ of the graph. Since there are 12 edges and 7 vertices, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 12) / 7 ≈ 3.43. However, the maximum degree Δ must be an integer, so it must be at least 4.\n\nNow, we know that the chromatic number is at most Δ + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5. However, we need to check if it's possible to color the graph with fewer colors. Since the graph has 12 edges, it's not a complete graph (a complete graph with 7 vertices would have 7 * 6 / 2 = 21 edges). Therefore, it's possible that the graph can be colored with fewer than 5 colors.\n\nWe can rule out using only 2 colors because a bipartite graph (which can be colored with 2 colors) with 7 vertices can have at most 3 * 4 = 12 edges, and our graph has 12 edges. Therefore, the minimum number of colors required is 3.\n\nSo, the minimum number of colors required to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 3."
