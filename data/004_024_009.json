    "message_2": "To find the derivative dy/dx, we will use implicit differentiation. We will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nDifferentiating x^2 y with respect to x, we get:\n2xy + x^2(dy/dx)\n\nDifferentiating cos(y) with respect to x, we get:\n-sin(y)(dy/dx)\n\nNow, we differentiate the whole equation with respect to x:\n\n2xy + x^2(dy/dx) - sin(y)(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we want to solve for dy/dx. First, we can factor dy/dx from the terms that involve it:\n\ndy/dx (x^2 - sin(y)) = -2xy\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dx by dividing both sides by (x^2 - sin(y)):\n\ndy/dx = -2xy / (x^2 - sin(y))\n\nNow, we can find the derivative at the point (1, 1) by plugging in x = 1 and y = 1:\n\ndy/dx = -2(1)(1) / (1^2 - sin(1))\n\ndy/dx ≈ -2 / (1 - 0.8415) = -2 / 0.1585 ≈ -12.618\n\nSo, the derivative dy/dx at the point (1, 1) is approximately -12.618."
