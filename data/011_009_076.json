    "message_1": "Suppose a restaurant offers a menu with 8 appetizers, 6 main courses, and 5 desserts. If a customer can choose 2 appetizers, 1 main course, and 1 dessert, how many different combinations of meals are possible? (Hint: use the Bell number formula for this.)",
    "message_2": "The hint provided is incorrect. The Bell number formula is used to count the number of ways to partition a set, which is not applicable in this problem. Instead, we will use the combination formula to solve this problem.\n\nThe customer can choose 2 appetizers out of 8, which can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = 28\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to choose 2 appetizers.\n\nThe customer can choose 1 main course out of 6:\n\nC(6, 1) = 6! / (1!(6-1)!) = 6! / (1!5!) = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to choose 1 main course.\n\nThe customer can choose 1 dessert out of 5:\n\nC(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5-1)!) = 5! / (1!4!) = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 ways to choose 1 dessert.\n\nTo find the total number of different combinations of meals, we multiply the number of ways to choose each course:\n\n28 (appetizers) * 6 (main courses) * 5 (desserts) = 840\n\nTherefore, there are 840 different combinations of meals possible."
