    "message_1": "A mass on a spring oscillates according to the trigonometric function y = 3sin(2πt/5), where y is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position in meters, and t is the time in seconds. What is the period and amplitude of the oscillation?",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 3sin(2πt/5).\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A*sin(Bt), where A is the amplitude and B is the angular frequency. The period of the function is given by the formula T = 2π/B.\n\nIn our case, A = 3 and B = 2π/5.\n\nThe amplitude of the oscillation is 3 meters.\n\nTo find the period, we can use the formula T = 2π/B:\n\nT = 2π / (2π/5)\nT = 5\n\nThe period of the oscillation is 5 seconds."
