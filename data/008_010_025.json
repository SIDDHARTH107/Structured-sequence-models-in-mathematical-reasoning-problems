    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  6 |\n| 2 -1  3 | -7 |\n| 3 -4  4 |  2 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 3*R1\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  6 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -19|\n| 0 -10 7 | -16|\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 2*R2\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  6 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -19|\n| 0  0 -3 |  22|\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. Let's use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\n-3z = 22\nz = -22/3\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\n-5y + 5(-22/3) = -19\n-5y - 110/3 = -19\ny = (-19 + 110/3) / 5\ny = 1\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nx + 2(1) - (-22/3) = 6\nx = 6 - 2 + 22/3\nx = 4/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4/3, y = 1, and z = -22/3."
