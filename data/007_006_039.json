    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 135 and 225 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (225) by the smaller number (135) and find the remainder.\n   225 รท 135 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 90.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (225) with the smaller number (135) and the smaller number with the remainder (90) from the previous step.\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n   135 รท 90 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 45.\n   90 รท 45 = 2 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 45.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 135 and 225 is 45."
