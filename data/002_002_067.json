    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 5 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)³\n\nV = (4/3)π(125)\n\nV = 500π/3\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters (rounded to one decimal place)."
