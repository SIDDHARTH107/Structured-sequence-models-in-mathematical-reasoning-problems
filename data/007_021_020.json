    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm used to find a non-trivial factor of a composite number. Here's the algorithm applied to find the smallest factor of 3641.\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) modulo n, where n is the number we want to factor. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n.\n2. Choose random initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the following steps until a factor is found:\n   a. Update x with f(x) modulo n.\n   b. Update y with f(f(y)) modulo n (i.e., apply the function twice).\n   c. Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n.\n   d. If the GCD is not 1 and not n, it is a non-trivial factor of n.\n\nNow, let's apply the algorithm to find the smallest factor of 3641.\n\nn = 3641\nf(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 3641\nx = 2\ny = 2\n\nIterate:\n\n1. x = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 3641 = 5\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 3641 = 26\n   GCD(|5 - 26|, 3641) = GCD(21, 3641) = 1 (continue)\n\n2. x = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 3641 = 26\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 3641 = 2590\n   GCD(|26 - 2590|, 3641) = GCD(2564, 3641) = 1 (continue)\n\n3. x = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) mod 3641 = 677\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2590)) = f(1759) = (1759^2 + 1) mod 3641 = 1013\n   GCD(|677 - 1013|, 3641) = GCD(336, 3641) = 1 (continue)\n\n4. x = f(x) = (677^2 + 1) mod 3641 = 2590\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(1013)) = f(3149) = (3149^2 + 1) mod 3641 = 677\n   GCD(|2590 - 677|, 3641) = GCD(1913, 3641) = 13 (found)\n\nThe smallest factor of 3641 is 13."
