    "message_2": "To find the expected number of employees committing financial fraud, we can multiply the total number of employees by the probability of an employee committing financial fraud.\n\nExpected number of employees committing financial fraud = Total number of employees × Probability of committing financial fraud\n\nExpected number of employees committing financial fraud = 500 × 0.04\n\nExpected number of employees committing financial fraud = 20\n\nSo, we can expect 20 employees to commit financial fraud in this company."
