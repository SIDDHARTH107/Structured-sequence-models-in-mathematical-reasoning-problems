    "message_1": "A control system has a transfer function given by G(s) = (s + 1)/(s^2 + 4s + 3). Apply the Fourier transform to find the system's frequency response at a specific frequency of 2 rad/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we need to replace s with jω, where j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1) and ω is the angular frequency in radians per second. In this case, ω = 2 rad/s.\n\nSo, G(jω) = G(j2) = (j2 + 1) / ((j2)^2 + 4(j2) + 3)\n\nNow, let's compute the expression:\n\nG(j2) = (j2 + 1) / ((-4 + 0j) + 4(j2) + 3)\n\nG(j2) = (j2 + 1) / (-1 + 4j2)\n\nNow, to find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response, we can compute the magnitude and phase of the complex number G(j2):\n\nMagnitude: |G(j2)| = sqrt(Real^2 + Imaginary^2)\n\n|G(j2)| = sqrt((-1)^2 + (4*2)^2) = sqrt(1 + 64) = sqrt(65)\n\nPhase: θ = arctan(Imaginary / Real)\n\nθ = arctan(4*2 / -1) = arctan(-8)\n\nNow, we have the magnitude and phase of the frequency response at ω = 2 rad/s:\n\nMagnitude: |G(j2)| = sqrt(65)\nPhase: θ = arctan(-8)\n\nThe frequency response of the system at 2 rad/s is given by the magnitude and phase values calculated above."
