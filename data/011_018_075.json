    "message_1": "A certain company wants to conduct a market survey by sending out a questionnaire with 10 questions. Each question has five possible answers. If the company wants to ensure that each possible set of answers for any three questions appears exactly once, how many questionnaires must be sent out?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of possible sets of answers for any three questions. Since each question has 5 possible answers, for 3 questions, there are 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 possible sets of answers.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that each of these 125 sets of answers appears exactly once. To do this, we can use the concept of combinatorics.\n\nWe have 10 questions, and we want to choose 3 of them. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 10 questions), k is the number of items we want to choose (in this case, 3 questions), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nUsing this formula, we can find the number of ways to choose 3 questions out of 10:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!) = 10! / (3!7!) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 120\n\nSo there are 120 different ways to choose 3 questions out of 10.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that each of the 125 sets of answers appears exactly once in these 120 different combinations of 3 questions. To do this, we can divide the total number of possible sets of answers (125) by the number of sets of answers that can appear in each combination of 3 questions (1):\n\nNumber of questionnaires = 125 / 1 = 125\n\nTherefore, the company must send out 125 questionnaires to ensure that each possible set of answers for any three questions appears exactly once."
