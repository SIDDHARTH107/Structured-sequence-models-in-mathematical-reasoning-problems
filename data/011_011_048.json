Count the number of ways these integers can be combined to form the sum 10.\n\nHere are the possible partitions of 10 into distinct positive integers:\n\n1. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n2. 1 + 2 + 7\n3. 1 + 3 + 6\n4. 1 + 4 + 5\n5. 2 + 3 + 5\n6. 2 + 8\n7. 3 + 7\n8. 4 + 6\n9. 10\n\nThere are 9 ways to partition the number 10 into distinct positive integers."
