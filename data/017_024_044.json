    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find the prime factorization of 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the p-group counts for each prime factor. The p-group count is given by the number of partitions of the exponent of the prime factor in the prime factorization.\n\nFor the prime factor 2 with exponent 5, there are 7 partitions: (5), (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1, 1), (2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1, 1, 1).\n\nFor the prime factor 3 with exponent 1, there is only 1 partition: (1).\n\nNow, we need to find the number of non-abelian groups for each partition. We can eliminate the partitions that result in abelian groups, which are the ones where all the parts are 1 or the partition has only one part.\n\nFor 2^5, we have the following non-abelian partitions: (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 1).\n\nFor 3^1, there are no non-abelian partitions since there is only one partition, which is abelian.\n\nNow, we will use the direct product of the non-abelian partitions to find the non-abelian groups of order 96:\n\n1. (4, 1) x (1) = Q8 x Z3\n2. (3, 2) x (1) = (Z4 x Z2) x Z3\n3. (3, 1, 1) x (1) = (Z2 x Z2 x Z2) x Z3\n4. (2, 2, 1) x (1) = (Z4 x Z4) x Z3\n\nSo, there are 4 non-abelian groups of order 96 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. Q8 x Z3\n2. (Z4 x Z2) x Z3\n3. (Z2 x Z2 x Z2) x Z3\n4. (Z4 x Z4) x Z3"
