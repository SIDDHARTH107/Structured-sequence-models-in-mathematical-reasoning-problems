    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 7 (days)\n- k = 3 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.4 (probability of rain on any single day)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k) = C(7, 3):\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!)\n         = 7! / (3! * 4!)\n         = 5040 / (6 * 24)\n         = 35\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(7, 3) * 0.4^3 * (1-0.4)^(7-3)\n         = 35 * 0.4^3 * 0.6^4\n         = 35 * 0.064 * 0.1296\n         = 35 * 0.0082944\n         â‰ˆ 0.2904\n\nSo, the probability of it raining on exactly 3 out of the next 7 days is approximately 0.2904 or 29.04%."
