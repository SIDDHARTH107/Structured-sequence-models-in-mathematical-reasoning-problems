    "message_1": "A traveling salesman needs to visit 5 cities (A, B, C, D, and E) and return to his starting point. The distances between each city are as follows:\n\nAB = 8, AC = 5, AD = 9, AE = 10,\nBC = 6, BD = 7, BE = 6,\nCD = 8, CE = 9,\nDE = 12.\n\nWhat is the shortest possible route the salesman can take to visit all the cities and return to the starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible permutations of the cities and calculating the total distance for each permutation. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) = 120 possible permutations. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5, which gives us 24 unique cycles to consider.\n\nHere are the 24 unique cycles and their total distances:\n\n1.
