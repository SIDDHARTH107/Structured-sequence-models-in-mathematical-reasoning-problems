    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the surface x^2 + y^2 - 2z = 0 at the point (1, 1, 1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\n1. First, parameterize the surface. Let x = u and y = v. Then, we have z = (u^2 + v^2)/2. The parameterization is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, (u^2 + v^2)/2)\n\n2. Compute the first fundamental form. We need the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, u)\nr_v = (0, 1, v)\n\nNow, compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + v^2\n\n3. Compute the second fundamental form. We need the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = (r_u x r_v) / ||r_u x r_v||\n\nr_u x r_v = (-u, -v, 1)\n||r_u x r_v|| = sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + 1)\n\nN = (-u/sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + 1), -v/sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + 1), 1/sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + 1))\n\nNow, compute the second derivatives of r:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 1)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 1)\n\nCompute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = N • r_uu = -u/sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + 1)\nM = N • r_uv = 0\nN = N • r_vv = -v/sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + 1)\n\n4. Compute the principal curvatures. We need to find the eigenvalues of the shape operator matrix:\n\nS = | L M |\n    | M N |\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\ndet(S - λI) = (L - λ)(N - λ) - M^2 = λ^2 - (L + N)λ + (LN - M^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 1), we have:\n\nL = -1/sqrt(3)\nM = 0\nN = -1/sqrt(3)\n\nThe characteristic equation becomes:\n\nλ^2 + (2/sqrt(3))λ + 1/3 = 0\n\nSolving for λ, we get the principal curvatures:\n\nλ1 = 1/sqrt(3)\nλ2 = -1/sqrt(3)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the surface x^2 + y^2 - 2z = 0 at the point (1, 1, 1) are 1/sqrt(3) and -1/sqrt(3)."
