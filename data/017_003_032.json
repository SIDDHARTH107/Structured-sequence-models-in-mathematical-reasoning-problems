    "message_2": "To prove that every element of G is a generator of G, we need to show that for any element g in G, the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by g is equal to the order of G, which is 11.\n\nLet g be an arbitrary element of G. Since G has order 11, the order of g must divide 11 by Lagrange's theorem. The only divisors of 11 are 1 and 11. If the order of g is 1, then g must be the identity element of G. However, the identity element cannot be a generator of G, as the cyclic subgroup it generates only contains itself.\n\nSo, the order of g must be 11. This means that the cyclic subgroup generated by g has 11 elements, which is the same as the order of G. Therefore, every element of G is a generator of G."
