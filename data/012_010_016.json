    "message_2": "To find the minimum vertex cover, we can use a greedy algorithm that selects vertices with the highest degree (number of edges connected to the vertex) first. In this case, we have:\n\n- Vertex A with degree 3 (connected to B, D, and G)\n- Vertex B with degree 3 (connected to A, D, and E)\n- Vertex C with degree 3 (connected to E, F, and G)\n- Vertex D with degree 3 (connected to A, B, and F)\n- Vertex E with degree 3 (connected to B, C, and G)\n- Vertex F with degree 3 (connected to C, D, and G)\n- Vertex G with degree 3 (connected to A, C, E, and F)\n\nWe can start by selecting vertex A, which covers edges AB, AD, and AG. Then, we can select vertex C, which covers edges CE, CF, and CG. At this point, all edges are covered, so the minimum vertex cover is {A, C} with a size of 2."
