    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients a0, an, and bn for the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval -2 <= x <= 2, we will use the following formulas:\n\na0 = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * 1) dx from -L to L\nan = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * cos(n * pi * x / L)) dx from -L to L\nbn = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * pi * x / L)) dx from -L to L\n\nIn this case, L = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find a0:\n\na0 = (1/2) * ∫(x^2) dx from -2 to 2\na0 = (1/2) * [(x^3)/3] from -2 to 2\na0 = (1/2) * [(8/3) - (-8/3)]\na0 = (1/2) * (16/3)\na0 = 8/3\n\nNow, let's find an:\n\nan = (1/2) * ∫(x^2 * cos(n * pi * x / 2)) dx from -2 to 2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x^2, dv = cos(n * pi * x / 2) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (2/n * pi) * sin(n * pi * x / 2)\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\nan = (1/2) * [(uv) from -2 to 2 - ∫(v * du) dx from -2 to 2]\nan = (1/2) * [(x^2 * (2/n * pi) * sin(n * pi * x / 2)) from -2 to 2 - ∫((2/n * pi) * sin(n * pi * x / 2) * 2x) dx from -2 to 2]\n\nThe first term (uv) will be zero because sin(n * pi * x / 2) is zero at x = -2 and x = 2. So we only need to solve the second integral:\n\nan = -(1/2) * (2/n * pi) * ∫(2x * sin(n * pi * x / 2)) dx from -2 to 2\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again:\n\nu = 2x, dv = sin(n * pi * x / 2) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = (-4/n * pi) * cos(n * pi * x / 2)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\nan = -(1/2) * (2/n * pi) * [(2x * (-4/n * pi) * cos(n * pi * x / 2)) from -2 to 2 - ∫((-4/n * pi) * cos(n * pi * x / 2) * 2) dx from -2 to 2]\n\nThe first term will be zero again because cos(n * pi * x / 2) is zero at x = -2 and x = 2. So we only need to solve the second integral:\n\nan = (1/2) * (2/n * pi) * (4/n * pi) * ∫(cos(n * pi * x / 2)) dx from -2 to 2\nan = (4/n^2 * pi^2) * [(2/n * pi) * sin(n * pi * x / 2)] from -2 to 2\n\nThis integral will also be zero because sin(n * pi * x / 2) is zero at x = -2 and x = 2. Therefore, an = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find bn:\n\nbn = (1/2) * ∫(x^2 * sin(n * pi * x / 2)) dx from -2 to 2\n\nThis integral is an odd function, and since we are integrating over a symmetric interval, the integral will be zero. Therefore, bn = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients for the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval -2 <= x <= 2 are:\n\na0 = 8/3\nan = 0 for all n\nbn = 0 for all n"
