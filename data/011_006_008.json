    "message_1": "A small coffee shop offers 3 types of syrups (vanilla, chocolate, and caramel) that can be added to their coffee. They also offer 5 types of cookies (chocolate chip, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, snickerdoodle, and double chocolate). A customer can order a coffee with any combination of syrups and cookies. How many possible orders are there if a customer can choose up to 2 syrups and up to 3 cookies?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of possible orders, we need to consider the combinations of syrups and cookies separately and then multiply them together.\n\nFor syrups, a customer can choose:\n1. No syrup\n2. 1 syrup (3 choices: vanilla, chocolate, or caramel)\n3. 2 syrups (3 combinations: vanilla-chocolate, vanilla-caramel, or chocolate-caramel)\n\nSo there are 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 possible syrup combinations.\n\nFor cookies, a customer can choose:\n1. No cookie\n2. 1 cookie (5 choices)\n3. 2 cookies (5 choose 2 = 10 combinations)\n4. 3 cookies (5 choose 3 = 10 combinations)\n\nSo there are 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 = 26 possible cookie combinations.\n\nNow, to find the total number of possible orders, we multiply the syrup combinations by the cookie combinations: 7 * 26 = 182 possible orders."
