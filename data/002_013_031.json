    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, you can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width of the base:\n\nBase area = length * width = 5 cm * 6 cm = 30 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 30 cm² * 8 cm = (1/3) * 240 cm³ = 80 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 80 cubic centimeters."
