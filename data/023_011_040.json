Use the Fourier transform to analyze the frequency components of this signal and determine the amplitude and phase angle for the component with the highest frequency.\n\nSignal: f(t) = 2sin(4πt) + 3cos(6πt) + 4sin(10πt) + cos(16πt) - 2sin(20πt) \n\nYour answer should include the amplitude and phase angle of the highest-frequency component.",
    "message_2": "To analyze the frequency components of the given signal f(t) using the Fourier transform, we first need to identify the individual components of the signal. The signal can be written as a sum of sinusoidal functions:\n\nf(t) = 2sin(4πt) + 3cos(6πt) + 4sin(10πt) + cos(16πt) - 2sin(20πt)\n\nWe can see that there are five components with frequencies 2Hz, 3Hz, 5Hz, 8Hz, and 10Hz. The highest frequency component is -2sin(20πt), with a frequency of 10Hz.\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude and phase angle of this component. We can rewrite the sine function as a cosine function with a phase shift:\n\n-2sin(20πt) = 2cos(20πt - π/2)\n\nNow, we can see that the amplitude of the highest-frequency component is 2, and the phase angle is -π/2 radians (or -90 degrees).\n\nSo, the amplitude and phase angle of the highest-frequency component are 2 and -π/2 radians (or -90 degrees), respectively."
