    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nA force of 5 N is applied on an object, moving it a distance of 10 meters in the direction of the force. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the force and the direction of displacement. Since the force is applied in the direction of the displacement, the angle θ is 0 degrees, and cos(0) = 1.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\nWork = Force × Distance\n\nNow, let's integrate the force over the distance. Let F(x) be the force function, which is constant in this case, and x be the distance.\n\nF(x) = 5 N\n\nWe want to find the integral of F(x) with respect to x from 0 to 10 meters:\n\nWork = ∫(F(x) dx) from 0 to 10\n\nSince F(x) is a constant function, the integral becomes:\n\nWork = ∫(5 dx) from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nWork = [5x] from 0 to 10\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = (5 × 10) - (5 × 0) = 50 - 0 = 50 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 50 Joules."
