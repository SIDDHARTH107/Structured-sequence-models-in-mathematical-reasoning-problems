    "message_2": "To find the ratio of the volume of a sphere inscribed in a cube to the volume of the cube, we first need to find the formulas for the volumes of both the sphere and the cube.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a cube is s³, where s is the side length of the cube.\n\nWhen a sphere is inscribed in a cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. In this case, the side length of the cube is 8 cm, so the diameter of the sphere is also 8 cm. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is 4 cm.\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere and the cube:\n\nSphere volume = (4/3)π(4 cm)³ = (4/3)π(64 cm³) = 256π/3 cm³\nCube volume = (8 cm)³ = 512 cm³\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the sphere volume to the cube volume:\n\nRatio = (Sphere volume) / (Cube volume) = (256π/3 cm³) / (512 cm³) = (256π/3) / (512) = π/6\n\nSo the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cube is π/6.\n\nNow, to find the volume of the sphere in cm³, we can use the sphere volume formula with the radius of 4 cm:\n\nSphere volume = (4/3)π(4 cm)³ = 256π/3 cm³\n\nTherefore, the volume of the sphere is 256π/3 cm³."
