    "message_1": "A typical knapsack has a maximum capacity of 15kg. There are 4 items with weights 4kg, 6kg, 10kg, and 12kg respectively, and with values of $10, $15, $20, and $25 respectively. What is the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack, we need to consider different combinations of items and their total weights and values. Since the knapsack has a maximum capacity of 15kg, we can only consider combinations that have a total weight of 15kg or less.\n\nHere are the possible combinations of items and their total weights and values:\n\n1. Item 1 (4kg, $10) + Item 2 (6kg, $15)\n   Total weight: 4kg + 6kg = 10kg\n   Total value: $10 + $15 = $25\n\n2. Item 1 (4kg, $10) + Item 3 (10kg, $20)\n   Total weight: 4kg + 10kg = 14kg\n   Total value: $10 + $20 = $30\n\n3. Item 1 (4kg, $10) + Item 4 (12kg, $25)\n   Total weight: 4kg + 12kg = 16kg (exceeds the maximum capacity)\n\n4. Item 2 (6kg, $15) + Item 3 (10kg, $20)\n   Total weight: 6kg + 10kg = 16kg (exceeds the maximum capacity)\n\n5. Item 2 (6kg, $15) + Item 4 (12kg, $25)\n   Total weight: 6kg + 12kg = 18kg (exceeds the maximum capacity)\n\n6. Item 3 (10kg, $20) or Item 4 (12kg, $25) alone\n   Since Item 4 has a higher value and its weight exceeds the maximum capacity, we can consider only Item 3.\n\nOut of these combinations, the one with the highest total value is the combination of Item 1 and Item 3, with a total value of $30. Therefore, the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack is $30."
