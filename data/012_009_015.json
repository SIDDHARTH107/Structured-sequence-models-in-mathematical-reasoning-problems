    "message_2": "A simple undirected graph is a graph with no loops and no multiple edges between any two vertices. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. A degree sequence is a list of the degrees of all vertices in the graph, sorted in non-increasing order.\n\nFor a graph with 6 vertices, the maximum degree of a vertex is 5 (connected to all other vertices). The minimum degree is 0 (not connected to any vertex). Let's consider the possible degree sequences for a simple undirected graph with 6 vertices.\n\n1. Degree sequence with all vertices having the same degree:\n\na. All vertices have degree 0: (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) - This is not a valid graph as there are no edges.\n\nb. All vertices have degree 1: (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) - This is not possible as the sum of degrees must be even (Handshaking Lemma), but here it is odd (6).\n\nc. All vertices have degree 2: (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) - This is a valid graph, which is a cycle graph or a 3-regular graph.\n\nd. All vertices have degree 3: (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) - This is not possible as the sum of degrees must be even, but here it is odd (18).\n\ne. All vertices have degree 4: (4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) - This is a valid graph, which is a complement of the graph in case (c).\n\nf. All vertices have degree 5: (5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) - This is not a valid graph as there are no edges.\n\n2. Degree sequences with different degrees:\n\nWe can have various combinations of degree sequences, but we need to ensure that they satisfy the Handshaking Lemma (sum of degrees is even) and the Havel-Hakimi theorem (a valid degree sequence must have a non-increasing order and be graphical).\n\nSome valid degree sequences for a simple undirected graph with 6 vertices are:\n\na. (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0) - A star graph with one vertex connected to all others and one isolated vertex.\nb. (4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1) - A graph with one vertex connected to 4 others, two vertices connected to 3 others, and two vertices connected to 2 others.\nc. (4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2) - A graph with two vertices connected to 4 others and four vertices connected to 2 others.\nd. (3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1) - A graph with three vertices connected to 3 others, two vertices connected to 1 other, and one vertex connected to 2 others.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the possible degree sequences for a simple undirected graph with 6 vertices. There can be more valid degree sequences, but they must satisfy the Handshaking Lemma and the Havel-Hakimi theorem."
