Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the partition function: P(5) = 7 and P(1) = 1, so there are 7 * 1 = 7 abelian groups.\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n * q^m: n(p^n, q^m) = n(p^n) * n(q^m) + n(p^n) * (n(q^m) - 1) / 2, where n(p^n) and n(q^m) are the numbers of abelian groups of orders p^n and q^m, respectively.\n\nApplying the formula, we get:\n\nn(2^5, 3^1) = n(2^5) * n(3^1) + n(2^5) * (n(3^1) - 1) / 2\nn(2^5, 3^1) = 7 * 1 + 7 * (1 - 1) / 2\nn(2^5, 3^1) = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
