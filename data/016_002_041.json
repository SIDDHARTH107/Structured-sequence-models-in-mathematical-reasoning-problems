    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is created by iteratively replacing each line segment with a smaller \"bump\" that consists of four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. After each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after four iterations:\n\n1. Original line segment length: 6 units\n2. After first iteration: (4/3) * 6 = 8 units\n3. After second iteration: (4/3) * 8 = 32/3 units\n4. After third iteration: (4/3) * (32/3) = 128/9 units\n5. After fourth iteration: (4/3) * (128/9) = 512/27 units\n\nSince the Koch snowflake has three sides, the total perimeter after four iterations is:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (512/27) = 1536/27 â‰ˆ 56.89 units"
