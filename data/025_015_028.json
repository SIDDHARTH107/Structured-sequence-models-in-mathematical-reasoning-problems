    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point $(1, -1, 1)$, we first need to find the gradient of the surface at this point. The gradient is given by the vector of partial derivatives with respect to each variable, i.e., $\\nabla F(x, y, z) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}\\right)$.\n\nThe given equation is $F(x, y, z) = 2x^2 + 3y^2 - 4z^2 + 4xy + 8xz - 6yz - 1 = 0$. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 4x + 4y + 8z$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 6y + 4x - 6z$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = -8z + 8x - 6y$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the gradient at the point $(1, -1, 1)$:\n\n$\\nabla F(1, -1, 1) = (4(1) + 4(-1) + 8(1), 6(-1) + 4(1) - 6(1), -8(1) + 8(1) - 6(-1)) = (4, -8, 6)$\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane at the point $(1, -1, 1)$ is given by the dot product of the gradient and the position vector $(x-1, y+1, z-1)$:\n\n$(4, -8, 6) \\cdot (x-1, y+1, z-1) = 0$\n\nExpanding the dot product, we get:\n\n$4(x-1) - 8(y+1) + 6(z-1) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we obtain:\n\n$4x - 8y + 6z = 10$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point $(1, -1, 1)$ is:\n\n$4x - 8y + 6z = 10$."
