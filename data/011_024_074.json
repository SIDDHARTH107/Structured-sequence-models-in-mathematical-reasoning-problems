The maximum capacity of each route is given in the table below. What is the minimum number of routes that the company must use to transport all 200 units of product from warehouse A to warehouse B?\n\n| Route | Maximum Capacity |\n|-------|-----------------|\n| 1     | 50 units        |\n| 2     | 30 units        |\n| 3     | 80 units        |\n| 4     | 40 units        |\n| 5     | 60 units        | \n\n(Note: The network flow problem assumes that the product can only flow in one direction between nodes, i.e., from A to B)",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of routes used, the company should prioritize using the routes with the highest capacity first. \n\n1. Route 3 has the highest capacity of 80 units. After using this route, 200 - 80 = 120 units still need to be transported.\n2. Route 5 has the next highest capacity of 60 units. After using this route, 120 - 60 = 60 units still need to be transported.\n3. Route 1 has the next highest capacity of 50 units. After using this route, 60 - 50 = 10 units still need to be transported.\n4. Route 4 has the next highest capacity of 40 units, which is more than enough to transport the remaining 10 units.\n\nTherefore, the company must use a minimum of 4 routes to transport all 200 units of product from warehouse A to warehouse B."
