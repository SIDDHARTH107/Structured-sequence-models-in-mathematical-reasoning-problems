    "message_1": "How many ways can you choose 4 items from a set of 10 distinct items if the order of selection doesn't matter? Use Pascal's triangle to determine the answer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's triangle, we need to find the binomial coefficient C(n, k), where n is the total number of distinct items (10 in this case) and k is the number of items we want to choose (4 in this case). The binomial coefficient can be found in Pascal's triangle by looking at the (k+1)-th entry in the (n+1)-th row.\n\nHere's a part of Pascal's triangle:\n\n```\n      1\n     1 1\n    1 2 1\n   1 3 3 1\n  1 4 6 4 1\n 1 5 10 10 5 1\n1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n```\n\nWe want to find the entry in the 11th row (10+1) and the 5th position (4+1). Continuing the Pascal's triangle:\n\n```\n 1  7  21  35  35  21  7  1\n1  8  28  56  70  56  28  8  1\n1  9  36  84 126 126  84  36  9 1\n1 10  45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1\n```\n\nThe entry we're looking for is in the 11th row and the 5th position, which is 210. So, there are 210 ways to choose 4 items from a set of 10 distinct items if the order of selection doesn't matter."
