    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 1, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1).\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx + d(2x)/dx - d(1)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 2x^(2-1) + 2 * 1x^(1-1) - 0\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we will find the derivative at x = 5:\n\nf'(5) = 6(5) + 2\nf'(5) = 30 + 2\nf'(5) = 32\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 1 at x = 5 is 32."
