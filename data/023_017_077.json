    "message_1": "In a fluid dynamics problem, the velocity profile of a liquid flow is given by the function $u(x) = \\frac{U_0}{(1+x^2/a^2)}$, where $U_0$ is a constant velocity, $x$ is the position along the flow direction, and $a$ is a constant. Find the frequency domain representation of this velocity profile using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of the velocity profile, we need to compute the Fourier transform of the given function $u(x)$. The Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$ is defined as:\n\n$$F(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i k x} dx$$\n\nIn our case, $f(x) = u(x) = \\frac{U_0}{(1+x^2/a^2)}$. So, we need to compute the Fourier transform of this function:\n\n$$U(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{U_0}{(1+x^2/a^2)} e^{-2\\pi i k x} dx$$\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the following property of the Fourier transform: the Fourier transform of a function multiplied by a constant is equal to the constant multiplied by the Fourier transform of the function. Therefore, we can take the constant $U_0$ out of the integral:\n\n$$U(k) = U_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(1+x^2/a^2)} e^{-2\\pi i k x} dx$$\n\nNow, we can recognize that the remaining integral is the Fourier transform of the Cauchy distribution with scale parameter $a$. The Fourier transform of the Cauchy distribution is known and given by:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(1+x^2/a^2)} e^{-2\\pi i k x} dx = a e^{-2\\pi |k| a}$$\n\nSo, the frequency domain representation of the velocity profile is:\n\n$$U(k) = U_0 a e^{-2\\pi |k| a}$$"
