    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The given conditions can be written as:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 2)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n\nFirst, find the product of the moduli: N = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.\n\nNext, compute the partial products:\nN1 = N / 2 = 15\nN2 = N / 3 = 10\nN3 = N / 5 = 6\n\nNow, find the modular inverses:\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 2) = 15^(-1) (mod 2) = 1\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 3) = 10^(-1) (mod 3) = 1\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 5) = 6^(-1) (mod 5) = 1\n\nFinally, compute the solution:\nx = (1 * 15 * 1) + (2 * 10 * 1) + (3 * 6 * 1) = 15 + 20 + 18 = 53\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we can subtract the product of the moduli (30) from the result:\nx = 53 - 30 = 23\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions is 23."
