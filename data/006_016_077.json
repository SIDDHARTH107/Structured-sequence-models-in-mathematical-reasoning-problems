    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces a certain type of product, and the probability of a defective product being produced is 0.2. If the company produces 100 products, what is the probability that exactly 15 products will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- n is the total number of products produced (100 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective products (15 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (0.2 in this case)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k defective products from n total products, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 15) = (100C15) * (0.2^15) * (0.8^85)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 100C15:\n\n100C15 = 100! / (15!(100-15)!)\n        = 100! / (15!85!)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorials, we get:\n\n100C15 = 253338471349988640\n\nNow, let's calculate the remaining part of the formula:\n\n(0.2^15) * (0.8^85)\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we get:\n\n(0.2^15) * (0.8^85) ≈ 0.000034223\n\nNow, multiply the two results together:\n\nP(X = 15) = 253338471349988640 * 0.000034223 ≈ 8.667\n\nHowever, this result is not correct, as probabilities should always be between 0 and 1. The issue is likely due to rounding errors in the calculations. To get a more accurate result, we can use a calculator or software specifically designed for binomial probability calculations.\n\nUsing a binomial probability calculator, we get:\n\nP(X = 15) ≈ 0.036265\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 15 products will be defective is approximately 0.0363 or 3.63%."
