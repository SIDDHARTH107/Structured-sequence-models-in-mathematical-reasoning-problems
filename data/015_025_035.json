    "message_2": "The transition from periodic behavior to chaotic behavior in the forced van der Pol oscillator is not a simple, well-defined value of the bifurcation parameter $\\epsilon$. The onset of chaos in such systems is typically complex and depends on various factors, including the values of $A$ and $\\omega$. \n\nHowever, some studies have shown that chaotic behavior can emerge for certain parameter ranges. For example, one study found that chaos can occur when $\\epsilon$ is in the range of 7.5 to 8.5, with $A = 1.2$ and $\\omega = 2/3$ (Storti et al., 1989). It is important to note that these values are specific to this particular study and may not be universally applicable.\n\nIn summary, there is no single value of $\\epsilon$ that guarantees the onset of chaotic behavior in the forced van der Pol oscillator. The transition to chaos depends on the specific values of the other parameters and the system's initial conditions.\n\nReference:\nStorti, M. A., Rand, R. H., & Grebogi, C. (1989).
