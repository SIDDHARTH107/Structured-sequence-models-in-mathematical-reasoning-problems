If you integrate $f(z)$ over a simple closed contour $C$ that encloses the origin $(0,0)$, what is the value of the integral?\n \nIn other words, determine the value of $\\oint_C z^2 dz$, where $C$ is a simple closed contour that encloses the origin in the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral $\\oint_C z^2 dz$, where $C$ is a simple closed contour enclosing the origin, we can use the Cauchy integral formula. The Cauchy integral formula states that for a holomorphic function $f(z)$ inside and on a simple closed contour $C$,\n\n$$f(a) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz$$\n\nIn our case, we want to find the integral of $f(z) = z^2$. To use the Cauchy integral formula, we need to find a function $g(z)$ such that $f(z) = g'(z)$. In this case, we can choose $g(z) = \\frac{1}{3}z^3$. Then, $g'(z) = z^2 = f(z)$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as\n\n$$\\oint_C z^2 dz = \\oint_C g'(z) dz$$\n\nBy the Cauchy integral theorem, the integral of a holomorphic function's derivative over a simple closed contour is zero. Therefore,\n\n$$\\oint_C z^2 dz = \\oint_C g'(z) dz = 0$$"
