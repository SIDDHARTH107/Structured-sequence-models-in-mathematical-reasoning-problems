    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a student to solve:\n\nThe equation of a curve is given by y = 2x^2 + 3x - 1. At what point on the curve does the tangent line have a slope of 7?",
    "message_2": "To find the point on the curve where the tangent line has a slope of 7, we need to find the derivative of the given equation and set it equal to 7. The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe given equation is y = 2x^2 + 3x - 1.\n\nFirst, find the derivative dy/dx:\ndy/dx = d(2x^2 + 3x - 1)/dx = 4x + 3\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 7:\n4x + 3 = 7\n\nSolve for x:\n4x = 4\nx = 1\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging x back into the original equation:\ny = 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 1\ny = 2 + 3 - 1\ny = 4\n\nSo, the point on the curve where the tangent line has a slope of 7 is (1, 4)."
