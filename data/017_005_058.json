    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P of G, which is of order 5^3. Let n_5 denote the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides the order of G, so n_5 | 125\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal in G. In this case, G is a group of prime power order with a unique Sylow p-subgroup, and by a theorem in group theory, G is necessarily a cyclic group.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where n_5 = 25. In this case, there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups, each of order 5^3. Let P be one of these Sylow 5-subgroups. Since the order of P is 5^3, P is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P must be isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n1. Z_125 (cyclic group of order 125)\n2. Z_25 × Z_5 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 25 and a cyclic group of order 5)\n3. Z_5 × Z_5 × Z_5 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5)\n\nHowever, since G is not cyclic (otherwise, we would have n_5 = 1), P cannot be isomorphic to Z_125. If P is isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_5 × Z_5, then the number of elements of order 5 in P would be (5-1)(5^2) = 100. However, this would mean that there are 100 elements of order 5 in G, which is a contradiction since G has only 125 elements in total. Therefore, P must be isomorphic to Z_25 × Z_5.\n\nNow, let H be a subgroup of P of order 25. Since P is normal in G, H is also normal in G. Let K be a subgroup of P of order 5. Since the intersection of H and K is trivial (only the identity element), and since the product of their orders is equal to the order of P, we have that P is isomorphic to the direct product H × K.\n\nFinally, we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 (K) and a group of order 25 (H)."
