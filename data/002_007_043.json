    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm, a base of 12 cm and a top base of 6 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 8 cm, the top base is 6 cm, and the bottom base is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (6 + 12) * 8\n\nArea = (1/2) * (18) * 8\n\nArea = 9 * 8\n\nArea = 72 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 72 square centimeters."
