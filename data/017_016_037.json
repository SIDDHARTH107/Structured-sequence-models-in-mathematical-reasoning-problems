Determine the number of elements in H and prove that H is a normal subgroup of G. Then prove that either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27 by finding the corresponding group structure.",
    "message_2": "Let H be the subgroup of G generated by the element a. Since the order of a is 3, H = {e, a, a^2}, where e is the identity element of G. Thus, H has 3 elements.\n\nNow, we will prove that H is a normal subgroup of G. To do this, we need to show that for any element g in G and any element h in H, the element g * h * g^(-1) is also in H.\n\nLet g be an arbitrary element in G and h be an arbitrary element in H. Since H has 3 elements, h can be either e, a, or a^2. We will consider each case separately:\n\n1. If h = e, then g * h * g^(-1) = g * e * g^(-1) = g * g^(-1) = e, which is in H.\n2. If h = a, then g * h * g^(-1) = g * a * g^(-1). Let this element be a^k for some k. Then, (g * a * g^(-1))^3 = (a^k)^3 = a^(3k) = e. Since the order of a is 3, 3k must be a multiple of 3. Thus, k must be a multiple of 3, so k can be 0, 1, or 2. If k = 0, then g * a * g^(-1) = e, which contradicts the fact that a has order 3. Therefore, k must be 1 or 2, so g * a * g^(-1) is either a or a^2, both of which are in H.\n3. If h = a^2, then g * h * g^(-1) = g * a^2 * g^(-1). Similar to the previous case, let this element be a^k for some k. Then, (g * a^2 * g^(-1))^3 = (a^k)^3 = a^(3k) = e. Since the order of a is 3, 3k must be a multiple of 3. Thus, k must be a multiple of 3, so k can be 0, 1, or 2. If k = 0, then g * a^2 * g^(-1) = e, which contradicts the fact that a^2 has order 3. Therefore, k must be 1 or 2, so g * a^2 * g^(-1) is either a or a^2, both of which are in H.\n\nIn all cases, g * h * g^(-1) is in H, so H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we will determine the possible group structures of G. Since H is a normal subgroup of G and has 3 elements, the factor group G/H has order 27/3 = 9. There are two possible group structures for a group of order 9: the cyclic group C9 and the non-abelian group of order 9. However, since there is no non-abelian group of order 9, G/H must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nLet b be an element in G such that its coset bH generates G/H. Then, the order of bH is 9. Since G is a group of order 27, the order of b must be a divisor of 27. The possible orders of b are 1, 3, 9, and 27. If the order of b is 1, then b is the identity element, which is not possible since bH generates G/H. If the order of b is 3, then b would be in H, which is also not possible since bH generates G/H. Therefore, the order of b must be either 9 or 27.\n\nIf the order of b is 9, then G is generated by the elements a and b, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of C3 and C9, which is a cyclic group of order 27, i.e., G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nIf the order of b is 27, then G is generated by the element b, and G is a cyclic group of order 27, i.e., G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nIn either case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27."
