    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 168 and 64 using the Euclidean algorithm, we'll perform a series of divisions and remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (168) by the smaller number (64) and find the remainder.\n   168 ÷ 64 = 2 with a remainder of 40.\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (64) and the smaller number with the remainder (40) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 64 and 40.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (64) by the smaller number (40) and find the remainder.\n   64 ÷ 40 = 1 with a remainder of 24.\n\n4. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (40) and the smaller number with the remainder (24) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 40 and 24.\n\n5. Divide the larger number (40) by the smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n   40 ÷ 24 = 1 with a remainder of 16.\n\n6. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (24) and the smaller number with the remainder (16) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 24 and 16.\n\n7. Divide the larger number (24) by the smaller number (16) and find the remainder.\n   24 ÷ 16 = 1 with a remainder of 8.\n\n8. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (16) and the smaller number with the remainder (8) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 16 and 8.\n\n9. Divide the larger number (16) by the smaller number (8) and find the remainder.\n   16 ÷ 8 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we've reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 8. Therefore, the GCD of 168 and 64 is 8."
