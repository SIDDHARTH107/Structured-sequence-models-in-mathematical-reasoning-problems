    "message_2": "First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:\n\n4x + 6y = 10\n\nNow we have:\n\n4x + 6y = 10\n4x - 6y = 13\n\nNext, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) + (4x - 6y) = 10 + 13\n8x = 23\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 23/8\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2(23/8) + 3y = 5\n\n23/4 + 3y = 5\n\nNow, subtract 23/4 from both sides:\n\n3y = 5 - 23/4\n3y = (20 - 23)/4\n3y = -3/4\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\ny = (-3/4) / 3\ny = -1/4\n\nSo the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 23/8\ny = -1/4"
