    "message_2": "To find the remainder when a number is divided by 9 using divisibility rules, we can sum the digits of the number and check the remainder when the sum is divided by 9.\n\nFor the number 7649:\n\n7 + 6 + 4 + 9 = 26\n\nNow, we find the remainder when 26 is divided by 9:\n\n26 รท 9 = 2 with a remainder of 8.\n\nSo, the remainder when 7649 is divided by 9 is 8."
