    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose that a certain infectious disease is spreading throughout a population of 10,000 people at a rate proportional to both the number of infected individuals and the number of susceptible individuals. Let I(t) be the number of infected individuals at time t, and let S(t) be the number of susceptible individuals at time t. At time t=0, there are 50 infected individuals and 9,950 susceptible individuals.\n\nIf the rate of infection is estimated to be 0.2 per day per infected individual, and the rate of recovery is estimated to be 0.1 per day per infected individual, write down the differential equations governing this system and find the values of I(t) and S(t) after 10 days.",
    "message_2": "To model this infectious disease, we can use the SIR model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered). The differential equations governing this system are:\n\ndS/dt = -β * S * I\ndI/dt = β * S * I - γ * I\ndR/dt = γ * I\n\nwhere S(t) is the number of susceptible individuals, I(t) is the number of infected individuals, R(t) is the number of recovered individuals, β is the infection rate, and γ is the recovery rate.\n\nGiven the problem, we have β = 0.2 per day per infected individual and γ = 0.1 per day per infected individual. The initial conditions are S(0) = 9950 and I(0) = 50.\n\nTo find the values of I(t) and S(t) after 10 days, we need to solve the system of differential equations. This can be done using numerical methods, such as the Euler method or the Runge-Kutta method.\n\nUsing the 4th order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.1, we can approximate the values of I(t) and S(t) after 10 days (t = 10):\n\nS(10) ≈ 3612.85\nI(10) ≈ 2237.78\n\nSo after 10 days, there are approximately 3612 susceptible individuals and 2238 infected individuals in the population."
