    "message_1": "In a manufacturing plant, a manager is choosing the optimal combination of three factors (A, B, C) to increase the production efficiency. Each factor has two levels, with the first level assigned a value of -1 and the second level assigned a value of +1. The manager decides to use an orthogonal array of strength 2 to determine the optimal combination. How many rows will the orthogonal array have?",
    "message_2": "An orthogonal array of strength 2 with three factors (A, B, C) and two levels for each factor will have 2^3 = 8 rows. This is because there are two levels for each of the three factors, and we need to consider all possible combinations of these levels."
