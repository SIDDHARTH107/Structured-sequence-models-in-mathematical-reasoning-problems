    "message_1": "A company has a rectangular plot of land with a total area of 8000 square meters. The company wants to erect a fence around the plot, but has only 100 meters of fencing material. What are the dimensions of the rectangular plot that will maximize the enclosed area?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular plot be L meters and the width be W meters. The area of the rectangular plot is given by A = L * W, and the perimeter is given by P = 2L + 2W.\n\nWe are given that the area A = 8000 square meters and the perimeter P = 100 meters. We can write the equations as follows:\n\n1) A = L * W = 8000\n2) P = 2L + 2W = 100\n\nWe can solve equation (2) for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (100 - 2L) / 2 = 50 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W in equation (1):\n\nA = L * (50 - L) = 8000\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nL^2 - 50L + 8000 = 0\n\nTo find the dimensions that maximize the enclosed area, we can use the vertex form of a quadratic equation, which is given by:\n\nf(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k\n\nWhere (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. In our case, the vertex will give us the maximum area.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is given by:\n\nh = -b / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 1 and b = -50, so:\n\nh = -(-50) / 2(1) = 50 / 2 = 25\n\nNow we can find the width W using the expression we found earlier:\n\nW = 50 - L = 50 - 25 = 25\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular plot that will maximize the enclosed area are 25 meters by 25 meters."
