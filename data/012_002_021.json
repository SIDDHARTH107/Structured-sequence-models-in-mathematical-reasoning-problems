    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of the graph, we can try to color the vertices using the minimum number of colors while ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's try coloring the graph:\n\n1. Color A with color 1.\n2. B and C are adjacent to A, so color B and C with color 2.\n3. D is adjacent to A, B, and C, so color D with color 3.\n4. E is adjacent to B and C, so color E with color 1.\n5. F is adjacent to B, C, and D, so color F with color 3.\n6. G is adjacent to C, D, and E, so color G with color 2.\n7. H is adjacent to F and I, so color H with color 1.\n8. I is adjacent to F, G, and H, so color I with color 3.\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph using 3 colors, and no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph is 3."
