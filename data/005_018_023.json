The following table summarizes the data:\n\n| Time intervals (in days) | Number of patients |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| 0-100                    | 30                 |\n| 100-200                  | 25                 |\n| 200-300                  | 20                 |\n| 300-400                  | 15                 |\n| 400-500                  | 5                  |\n| 500-600                  | 5                  |\n\nCalculate the median survival time and the survival probability at 400 days.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the median survival time, we need to find the time at which 50% of the patients are still alive. Since there are 100 patients in total, we are looking for the time at which 50 patients are still alive.\n\nFirst, let's find the cumulative number of patients for each time interval:\n\n| Time intervals (in days) | Number of patients | Cumulative number of patients |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 0-100                    | 30                 | 30                              |\n| 100-200                  | 25                 | 55                              |\n| 200-300                  | 20                 | 75                              |\n| 300-400                  | 15                 | 90                              |\n| 400-500                  | 5                  | 95                              |\n| 500-600                  | 5                  | 100                             |\n\nThe median survival time is in the 100-200 days interval since the cumulative number of patients reaches 50% (55 patients) in this interval. To find the exact median survival time, we can use linear interpolation:\n\nMedian = Lower limit + [(N/2 - Cumulative frequency of the previous interval) / Frequency of the median interval] * Width of the interval\n\nWhere N is the total number of patients (100), the lower limit of the median interval is 100, the cumulative frequency of the previous interval is 30, the frequency of the median interval is 25, and the width of the interval is 100.\n\nMedian = 100 + [(100/2 - 30) / 25] * 100\nMedian = 100 + [20 / 25] * 100\nMedian = 100 + 0.8 * 100\nMedian = 180\n\nThe median survival time is 180 days.\n\nTo calculate the survival probability at 400 days, we need to find the proportion of patients who survived beyond 400 days. From the cumulative number of patients table, we can see that 90 patients survived up to 400 days. So, the number of patients who survived beyond 400 days is 100 - 90 = 10.\n\nThe survival probability at 400 days is the number of patients who survived beyond 400 days divided by the total number of patients:\n\nSurvival probability at 400 days = 10 / 100 = 0.1\n\nThe survival probability at 400 days is 0.1 or 10%."
