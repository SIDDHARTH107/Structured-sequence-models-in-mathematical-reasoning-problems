    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change with the number of iterations. It remains constant, regardless of the iteration number. To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each line segment is divided into 4 smaller segments, so N = 4. The scaling factor is 3, as each smaller segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619.\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the 4th iteration (or any iteration) is approximately 1.2619."
