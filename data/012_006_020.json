    "message_2": "This graph does contain an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit is a closed path that traverses each edge of a graph exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if all its vertices have an even degree (number of edges incident to the vertex).\n\nIn this graph, all vertices have a degree of 2, which is even. Therefore, an Eulerian circuit exists. One possible Eulerian circuit is: A-B-D-C-A."
