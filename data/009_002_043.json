    "message_1": "Consider a population of 10,000 people in a city. The number of people infected with a contagious disease is increasing by 20% each day. Initially, there were only 50 infected people. Assuming that the population growth is negligible, use a differential equation to model the spread of the disease and calculate how long it will take for the number of infected people to reach 5,000.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of infected people as I(t), where t is the number of days since the initial infection. We are given that the rate of increase of infected people is 20% per day. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\ndI/dt = 0.2 * I(t)\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve this equation, we can use the separation of variables technique. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndI/I(t) = 0.2 dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/I(t)) dI = ∫0.2 dt\n\nln(I(t)) = 0.2t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition I(0) = 50:\n\nln(50) = 0.2(0) + C\nC = ln(50)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(I(t)) = 0.2t + ln(50)\n\nTo find I(t), we can take the exponent of both sides:\n\nI(t) = e^(0.2t + ln(50))\n\nUsing the property of exponents, we can rewrite this as:\n\nI(t) = e^(0.2t) * e^(ln(50))\n\nSince e^(ln(x)) = x, we have:\n\nI(t) = 50 * e^(0.2t)\n\nNow, we want to find the time t when the number of infected people reaches 5,000:\n\n5000 = 50 * e^(0.2t)\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\n100 = e^(0.2t)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(100) = 0.2t\n\nFinally, solve for t:\n\nt = ln(100) / 0.2 ≈ 23.025\n\nSo, it will take approximately 23 days for the number of infected people to reach 5,000 in the city."
