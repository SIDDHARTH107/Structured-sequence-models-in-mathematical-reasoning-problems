    "message_2": "Morse homology is a homology theory that studies the topology of a manifold by analyzing the critical points of a smooth function on the manifold. In this case, we have a smooth function $f:\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with two critical points, one local maximum, and one local minimum.\n\nLet's first recall some basic concepts of Morse homology. The Morse complex is a chain complex generated by the critical points of the function $f$. The differential of the Morse complex counts the number of gradient flow lines between critical points of consecutive indices. The homology of the Morse complex, called Morse homology, is isomorphic to the singular homology of the manifold.\n\nNow let's analyze the given problem. We have two critical points $p$ and $q$ with critical values $f(p)=0$ and $f(q)=1$. Since $p$ is a local minimum and $q$ is a local maximum, their Morse indices are $0$ and $2$, respectively. The level sets we are interested in are $f^{-1}([0,1/2))$ and $f^{-1}([1/2,1])$.\n\nSince the Morse indices of $p$ and $q$ are $0$ and $2$, there are no critical points with Morse index $1$. Therefore, there are no gradient flow lines between critical points of consecutive indices. This means that the differential of the Morse complex is trivial, and the Morse homology is generated by the critical points themselves.\n\nNow we can compute the number of connected components of the level sets. The level set $f^{-1}([0,1/2))$ contains the local minimum $p$, and since there are no critical points with Morse index $1$, there are no gradient flow lines connecting $p$ to any other critical points. Therefore, the level set $f^{-1}([0,1/2))$ has only one connected component.\n\nSimilarly, the level set $f^{-1}([1/2,1])$ contains the local maximum $q$, and since there are no critical points with Morse index $1$, there are no gradient flow lines connecting $q$ to any other critical points. Therefore, the level set $f^{-1}([1/2,1])$ also has only one connected component.\n\nIn conclusion, the level sets $f^{-1}([0,1/2))$ and $f^{-1}([1/2,1])$ both have one connected component each."
