    "message_2": "To maximize the area of a rectangle with a given perimeter, the rectangle should be a square. This is because, for a fixed perimeter, a square has the largest area among all rectangles.\n\nLet the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. The perimeter is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the perimeter is 54 inches, we have:\n\n54 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions L and W that maximize the area. Since we want a square, we have L = W. We can rewrite the perimeter equation as:\n\n54 = 2L + 2L\n\n54 = 4L\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n\nL = 54 / 4\nL = 13.5\n\nSince L = W, we have:\n\nW = 13.5\n\nSo, the dimensions of the poster should be 13.5 inches by 13.5 inches to maximize its area."
