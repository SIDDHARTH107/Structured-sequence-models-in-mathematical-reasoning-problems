    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors needed to color each edge of G such that no two adjacent edges have the same color, we can use the concept of edge chromatic number. The edge chromatic number is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of a graph so that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nIn this case, we can observe that the graph G is a complete bipartite graph with the partition sets {a, d} and {b, c, e, f}. A complete bipartite graph K(m, n) has an edge chromatic number equal to max(m, n).\n\nHere, m = 2 and n = 4. So, the edge chromatic number of G is max(2, 4) = 4.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color each edge of G such that no two adjacent edges have the same color is 4."
