    "message_2": "To determine the frequency components of the stock prices using the Fourier transform, we will first need to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the given data. The DFT is defined as:\n\nX(k) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2π * k * n / N)]\n\nwhere X(k) is the k-th frequency component, x(n) is the n-th data point, N is the total number of data points, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the stock prices for the past 5 days as [10, 12, 15, 13, 14], we have N = 5. We will compute the DFT for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nX(0) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2π * 0 * n / 5)] = Σ [x(n)] = 10 + 12 + 15 + 13 + 14 = 64\n\nX(1) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2π * 1 * n / 5)] = 10 * e^(0) + 12 * e^(-j * 2π * 1 / 5) + 15 * e^(-j * 2π * 2 / 5) + 13 * e^(-j * 2π * 3 / 5) + 14 * e^(-j * 2π * 4 / 5)\nX(1) ≈ -1.702 + 0.376j\n\nX(2) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2π * 2 * n / 5)] = 10 * e^(0) + 12 * e^(-j * 2π * 2 / 5) + 15 * e^(-j * 2π * 4 / 5) + 13 * e^(-j * 2π * 6 / 5) + 14 * e^(-j * 2π * 8 / 5)\nX(2) ≈ 0.702 - 1.624j\n\nX(3) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2π * 3 * n / 5)] = 10 * e^(0) + 12 * e^(-j * 2π * 3 / 5) + 15 * e^(-j * 2π * 6 / 5) + 13 * e^(-j * 2π * 9 / 5) + 14 * e^(-j * 2π * 12 / 5)\nX(3) ≈ 0.702 + 1.624j\n\nX(4) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2π * 4 * n / 5)] = 10 * e^(0) + 12 * e^(-j * 2π * 4 / 5) + 15 * e^(-j * 2π * 8 / 5) + 13 * e^(-j * 2π * 12 / 5) + 14 * e^(-j * 2π * 16 / 5)\nX(4) ≈ -1.702 - 0.376j\n\nThe frequency components of the stock prices are:\n\nX(0) = 64\nX(1) ≈ -1.702 + 0.376j\nX(2) ≈ 0.702 - 1.624j\nX(3) ≈ 0.702 + 1.624j\nX(4) ≈ -1.702 - 0.376j\n\nKeep in mind that the Fourier transform assumes periodicity in the data, so the results may not be directly applicable to non-periodic stock price variations. However, this analysis can still provide some insight into the frequency components present in the given data."
