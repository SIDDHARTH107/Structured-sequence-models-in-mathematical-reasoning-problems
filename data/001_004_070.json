    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x, first look for a common factor among all the terms. In this case, the common factor is x. Factor out x from each term:\n\nx(x^2 - 3x + 2)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. Look for two numbers that multiply to 2 and add to -3. These numbers are -1 and -2. So, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as:\n\nx((x - 1)(x - 2))\n\nThe factored form of the polynomial x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x is:\n\nx(x - 1)(x - 2)"
