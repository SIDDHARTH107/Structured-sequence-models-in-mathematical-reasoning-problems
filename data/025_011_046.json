    "message_2": "Let $\\text{Aut}(A)$ denote the group of automorphisms of $A$. We will show that the order of $\\text{Aut}(A)$ is at most $2^g$.\n\nConsider the action of $\\text{Aut}(A)$ on the set of rational points $A(\\mathbb{Q})$. Since $A(\\mathbb{Q})$ is finite, the action of $\\text{Aut}(A)$ on $A(\\mathbb{Q})$ is a permutation action. Let $G$ be the subgroup of $\\text{Aut}(A)$ that fixes the identity element $0 \\in A(\\mathbb{Q})$. Then $G$ is a subgroup of $\\text{Aut}(A)$ and consists of automorphisms of the form $a \\mapsto a + b$ for some fixed $b \\in A(\\mathbb{Q})$. \n\nNow, consider the action of $G$ on the tangent space $T_0 A$ at the identity element $0$. Since $A$ is an Abelian variety, $T_0 A$ is a $g$-dimensional complex vector space. The action of $G$ on $T_0 A$ is linear, and we can identify $G$ with a subgroup of the general linear group $\\text{GL}_g(\\mathbb{C})$. \n\nSince $G$ is a subgroup of $\\text{Aut}(A)$, which is a finite group, $G$ must also be a finite group. Therefore, $G$ is a finite subgroup of $\\text{GL}_g(\\mathbb{C})$. By a theorem of Jordan, every finite subgroup of $\\text{GL}_g(\\mathbb{C})$ is conjugate to a subgroup of the group of upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal, which is isomorphic to the additive group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^g$. Thus, the order of $G$ is at most $2^g$.\n\nNow, let $H$ be the stabilizer of $0$ in $\\text{Aut}(A)$. Then $H$ is a normal subgroup of $\\text{Aut}(A)$, and $\\text{Aut}(A)/H$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$, where $n = |A(\\mathbb{Q})|$. Since $A(\\mathbb{Q})$ is finite, $n$ is finite, and therefore, the order of $\\text{Aut}(A)/H$ is finite.\n\nBy the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have $|\\text{Aut}(A)| = |H| \\cdot |\\text{Aut}(A)/H|$. Since $|H|$ is at most $2^g$ and $|\\text{Aut}(A)/H|$ is finite, it follows that $|\\text{Aut}(A)|$ is at most $2^g$."
