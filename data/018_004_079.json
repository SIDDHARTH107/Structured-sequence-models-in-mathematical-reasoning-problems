    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define a universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nLet's assume U is the set of integers from 1 to 10. So, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now, we can find the complement of set A with respect to U.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's prove that the complement of set A is unique. Suppose there is another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also a complement of A with respect to U. This means that B contains all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nSince A' and B are both complements of A, they should have the same elements that are not in A. But we assumed that B ≠ A', which means there must be at least one element in B that is not in A'. Let's say this element is y.\n\nIf y ∈ B and y ∉ A', then y must be in A (because B is a complement of A). But this contradicts the fact that B is a complement of A, as y should not be in A if it is in B. This contradiction means that our assumption that B ≠ A' is false.\n\nTherefore, the complement of set A is unique, and in this case, A' = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}."
