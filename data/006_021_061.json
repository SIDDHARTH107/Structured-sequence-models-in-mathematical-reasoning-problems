    "message_1": "According to weather statistics, the probability of a severe thunderstorm occurring in a certain region in the month of June is 0.25. What is the probability that in the next two years (i.e. 24 months) there will be at least one severe thunderstorm in this region during the month of June?",
    "message_2": "We are given the probability of a severe thunderstorm occurring in the month of June as 0.25. We want to find the probability of at least one severe thunderstorm occurring in the next two years (i.e., in the next two Junes).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can first find the probability of no severe thunderstorms occurring in the next two Junes and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least one severe thunderstorm occurring.\n\nThe probability of no severe thunderstorm in a single June is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\n\nFor two consecutive Junes, the probability of no severe thunderstorms in both is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one severe thunderstorm occurring in the next two Junes by subtracting the probability of no severe thunderstorms from 1:\n\n1 - 0.5625 = 0.4375\n\nSo, the probability of at least one severe thunderstorm occurring in the next two years during the month of June is 0.4375 or 43.75%."
