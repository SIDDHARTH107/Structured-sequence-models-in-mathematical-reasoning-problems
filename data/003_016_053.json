    "message_1": "A sinusoidal waveform has an equation of y = 2sin(2x - pi/4). What is the phase shift of this function?",
    "message_2": "The general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A*sin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift. In the given equation, y = 2sin(2x - pi/4), we can see that the phase shift C is equal to pi/4.\n\nHowever, to find the phase shift in terms of x, we need to divide C by B. In this case, B = 2.\n\nSo, the phase shift in terms of x is (pi/4) / 2 = pi/8.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift of the function is pi/8."
