    "message_1": "How many non-isomorphic groups of order 18 are there, and what are their corresponding group structures?",
    "message_2": "To find the non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we first need to consider the prime factorization of 18, which is 2 * 3^2. Now, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. If a group G has order p^2 for some prime p, then G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_(p^2) or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, i.e., Z_p × Z_p.\n\n2. If a group G has order pq for distinct primes p and q, then G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_(pq) or a semi-direct product of two cyclic groups of order p and q.\n\nUsing these facts, we can find the non-isomorphic groups of order 18:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 18: Z_18\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3: Z_3 × Z_3\n\n3. Semi-direct product of cyclic groups of order 2 and 9: Since there are two distinct automorphisms of Z_9 (identity and inversion), there are two possible semi-direct products: one is the dihedral group D_9, and the other is a non-abelian group called the Quaternion group of order 18 (Q_18).\n\nSo, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 18, and their corresponding group structures are:\n\n1. Z_18\n2. Z_3 × Z_3\n3. D_9 (or Q_18)"
