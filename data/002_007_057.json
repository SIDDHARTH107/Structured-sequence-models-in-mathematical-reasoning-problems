    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm, a base of 8 cm and a smaller base of 5 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 10 cm, the larger base is 8 cm, and the smaller base is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (8 + 5) * 10\nArea = (1/2) * (13) * 10\nArea = 6.5 * 10\nArea = 65 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 65 square centimeters."
