    "message_1": "A pizza has a diameter of 14 inches. What is the area of the sector if you slice the pizza into six equal slices?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector, we need to know the angle of the sector and the radius of the circle. Since the pizza is sliced into six equal slices, each slice will have an angle of 360°/6 = 60°.\n\nThe diameter of the pizza is 14 inches, so the radius is half of that, which is 7 inches.\n\nThe formula for the area of a sector is:\n\nArea = (angle/360°) × π × r²\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nArea = (60°/360°) × π × 7²\nArea = (1/6) × π × 49\nArea = 49π/6\n\nThe area of one sector (or one slice) of the pizza is 49π/6 square inches."
