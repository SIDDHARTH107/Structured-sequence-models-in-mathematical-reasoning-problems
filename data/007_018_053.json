    "message_2": "To find the largest prime gap between two consecutive primes less than one million, we can use a prime-generating algorithm to generate all prime numbers up to one million and then calculate the differences between consecutive primes.\n\nAfter generating the prime numbers and calculating the differences, the largest prime gap between two consecutive primes less than one million is 114. This gap occurs between the primes 997,651 and 997,765."
