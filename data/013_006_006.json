    "message_1": "A group of farmers from a village decide to either hunt a stag or a hare for their meal. If all farmers work together to hunt a stag, they will have a bounty of 500 units of food. However, if one or more farmers decide to hunt a hare instead, they will get only 50 units of food each. If a farmer decides to hunt a stag but others hunt a hare, he/she will get nothing. There are 10 farmers in total. What is the best decision for the farmers to make, assuming they all aim to maximize their food intake?",
    "message_2": "If all 10 farmers work together to hunt a stag, they will have a total of 500 units of food. Since there are 10 farmers, each farmer would get 500/10 = 50 units of food.\n\nIf one or more farmers decide to hunt a hare instead, they will get only 50 units of food each. However, this will also cause the farmers who are hunting the stag to get nothing.\n\nThe best decision for the farmers to make, assuming they all aim to maximize their food intake, is for all of them to work together to hunt the stag. This way, each farmer will get 50 units of food, which is the maximum they can get in this scenario."
