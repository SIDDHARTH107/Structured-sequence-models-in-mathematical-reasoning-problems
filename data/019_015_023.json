    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to type theory:\n\nSuppose we have a set of types T = {int, bool, list}. We define a function F that takes in two arguments of types x and y, and returns a type z=y if x is int, and z=bool otherwise. Using this information, what is the resulting type of F(int, list)?",
    "message_2": "Given the function F and the input F(int, list), we can determine the resulting type as follows:\n\nSince the first argument x is int, according to the function definition, the resulting type z will be equal to the second argument y. In this case, y is list.\n\nTherefore, the resulting type of F(int, list) is list."
