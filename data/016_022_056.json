    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of triangles increases.\n\nLet's denote the total number of triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid at the nth iteration as T(n). At the 0th iteration, there is only one tetrahedron, which has 4 triangular faces. So, T(0) = 4.\n\nIn each iteration, each of the existing triangles is replaced by 3 new triangles, so the number of triangles increases by a factor of 3. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid at the nth iteration can be calculated as:\n\nT(n) = 4 * 3^n\n\nNow, we want to find the total number of triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid at the 5th iteration:\n\nT(5) = 4 * 3^5 = 4 * 243 = 972\n\nSo, there are 972 triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid constructed till the 5th iteration."
