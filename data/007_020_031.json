    "message_1": "Suppose you want to send a secret message using RSA encryption. You choose two prime numbers, $p=23$ and $q=29$, and find that the encryption key is $e=5$. If the plaintext message is the number $m=7$, what is the resulting ciphertext that can be sent?",
    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext using RSA encryption, we first need to compute the modulus $n$ and the totient $\\varphi(n)$. \n\n1. Compute the modulus $n$:\n$n = p \\times q = 23 \\times 29 = 667$\n\n2. Compute the totient $\\varphi(n)$:\n$\\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (23-1)(29-1) = 22 \\times 28 = 616$\n\nNow we have the public key $(n, e) = (667, 5)$. To encrypt the plaintext message $m=7$, we compute the ciphertext $c$ using the formula:\n\n$c = m^e \\pmod{n}$\n\n$c = 7^5 \\pmod{667}$\n\n$c = 16807 \\pmod{667}$\n\n$c = 219$\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext that can be sent is $c = 219$."
