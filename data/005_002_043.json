    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the true mean number of hours spent studying per week, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Z-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nIn this case, the mean is 12, the standard deviation is 3, and the sample size is 100. For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (which can be found in a Z-score table or using a calculator).\n\nConfidence Interval = 12 ± (1.96 * (3 / √100))\n\nConfidence Interval = 12 ± (1.96 * (3 / 10))\n\nConfidence Interval = 12 ± (1.96 * 0.3)\n\nConfidence Interval = 12 ± 0.588\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean number of hours spent studying per week is (11.412, 12.588)."
