    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 96 = 2^5 * 3. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 ∈ {1, 3}.\n2. n_3 divides 2^5 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 ∈ {1, 4}.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C96.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C96, then G is abelian and has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Thus, n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1. This is consistent with the Sylow theorems, so G could be isomorphic to C96.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nThe order of A4 × C4 × C2 is 12 * 4 * 2 = 96. The group A4 × C4 × C2 is not cyclic, but it is abelian. Therefore, it has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Thus, n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1. This is consistent with the Sylow theorems, so G could be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nCase 3: G is isomorphic to one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then it cannot have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. This is because if n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G would be the direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and its Sylow 3-subgroup, which would make G abelian, contradicting the assumption that G is non-abelian.\n\nThus, if G is non-abelian, we must have either n_2 = 3 or n_3 = 4. In either case, G will have more than one Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p, which is consistent with the Sylow theorems. Therefore, G could be isomorphic to one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the Sylow theorems, it is possible for G to be isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, or any one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. To determine which specific group G is isomorphic to, more information about G would be needed."
