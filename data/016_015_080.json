    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that visits every point in a square grid. It is constructed iteratively, and with each iteration, the curve becomes more complex. In this case, we are asked to find the coordinates of the 500th point on the curve after 3 iterations.\n\nFirst, let's understand the basic structure of the Hilbert curve after each iteration:\n\n1st iteration: The curve has 4 points (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,0).\n2nd iteration: The curve has 16 points.\n3rd iteration: The curve has 64 points.\n\nNow, let's find the 500th point on the 3rd iteration Hilbert curve. Since the 3rd iteration curve has only 64 points, the 500th point does not exist on the curve. However, if you meant the 50th point instead, we can find its coordinates.\n\nTo find the 50th point, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the point number (50) to base 4. In this case, 50 in base 10 is equal to 302 in base 4.\n2. Reverse the base 4 representation: 203.\n3. Convert each digit to its corresponding 2-bit binary representation: 02 00 11.\n4. Pair the binary digits: (0, 2), (0, 0), (1, 1).\n5. Apply the Gray code transformation to each pair: (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1).\n6. Convert the pairs back to decimal: (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1).\n\nThe 50th point on the 3rd iteration Hilbert curve is at the coordinates (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1)."
