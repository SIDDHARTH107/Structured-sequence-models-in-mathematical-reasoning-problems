    "message_1": "In Rail fence cipher, a message \"HELLO WORLD\" is encrypted using 3 rails. If the encrypted message is \"HOLELWRDLO\", decrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails, we need to arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern and then read the plaintext horizontally. The encrypted message \"HOLELWRDLO\" has 10 characters. We can arrange them as follows:\n\nH . . . O . . . L\n. E . L . W . R .\n. . D . . . O . .\n\nNow, we can read the decrypted message horizontally:\n\nHELLO WORLD"
