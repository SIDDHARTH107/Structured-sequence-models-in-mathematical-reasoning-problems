    "message_2": "Let Z(G) be the center of the group G. Since Z(G) is non-trivial, it must have at least one element other than the identity element e. Let's denote this element by a, so a is in Z(G) and a is not equal to e.\n\nRecall that the order of an element divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 9, the possible orders of a are 1, 3, and 9. However, we know that a is not the identity element, so the order of a cannot be 1. Thus, the order of a must be either 3 or 9.\n\nCase 1: The order of a is 3.\nIn this case, the subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, has order 3. Since the order of G is 9, there must be another element b in G that is not in <a>. Let's consider the commutator [a, b] = aba^(-1)b^(-1). Since a is in the center of G, we have ab = ba, which implies that [a, b] = e. This means that b commutes with a, and thus b is also in Z(G).\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup generated by both a and b, denoted by <a, b>. Since both a and b are in Z(G), every element in <a, b> is also in Z(G). Since G is a group of order 9 and Z(G) is non-trivial, the order of Z(G) must be 3 or 9. If the order of Z(G) is 3, then there must be an element in G that is not in Z(G), which contradicts the fact that <a, b> contains all elements of G. Therefore, the order of Z(G) must be 9, which means that Z(G) = G.\n\nCase 2: The order of a is 9.\nIn this case, the subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, has order 9. Since the order of G is 9, this implies that G = <a>.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that G is equal to its center Z(G). This means that G is an abelian group. Moreover, in case 2, we have shown that G is generated by a single element a, which means that G is a cyclic group of order 9. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
