    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to compute the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)] dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) = 0 for -π < x < 0 and f(x) = 2 for 0 < x < π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫(0) dx from -π to 0 + ∫(2) dx from 0 to π]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [0 + 2π] = 2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(0 * cos(n * x)) dx from -π to 0 + ∫(2 * cos(n * x)) dx from 0 to π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [0 + (2/n) * sin(n * x) from 0 to π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(2/n) * (sin(n * π) - sin(0))] = 0 (since sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(0 * sin(n * x)) dx from -π to 0 + ∫(2 * sin(n * x)) dx from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [0 + (-2/n) * cos(n * x) from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(0))]\n\nFor odd values of n, cos(n * π) = -1, and for even values of n, cos(n * π) = 1. Thus, b_n = 0 for even values of n, and for odd values of n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (-2)] = 4/nπ\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = 2 + Σ [(4/nπ) * sin(n * x)] for odd values of n\n\nNow, let's sketch the waveform for the fundamental frequency and the first four harmonics of the series:\n\n1. Fundamental frequency (n = 1): f_1(x) = 2 + (4/π) * sin(x)\n2. Second harmonic (n = 3): f_2(x) = (4/3π) * sin(3x)\n3. Third harmonic (n = 5): f_3(x) = (4/5π) * sin(5x)\n4. Fourth harmonic (n = 7): f_4(x) = (4/7π) * sin(7x)\n\nThe waveform sketches would show the amplitude of each harmonic decreasing as the frequency increases. The fundamental frequency would have the largest amplitude, and each subsequent harmonic would have a smaller amplitude. The overall waveform would be a combination of these harmonics, approximating the original function f(x) as more harmonics are added."
