    "message_2": "To find Q = 2P, we need to perform the point doubling operation on P. The formula for point doubling is given by:\n\nλ = (3x₁² + a) / 2y₁ (mod p)\nx₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂ (mod p)\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod p)\n\nHere, P = (x₁, y₁) = (5, 1), a = 6 (coefficient of x in the curve equation), and p = 11 (the finite field F_11).\n\nFirst, we compute λ:\n\nλ = (3x₁² + a) / 2y₁ (mod p)\nλ = (3 * 5² + 6) / (2 * 1) (mod 11)\nλ = (75 + 6) / 2 (mod 11)\nλ = 81 / 2 (mod 11)\nλ = 40.5 (mod 11) (Since we are working in a finite field, we need to find an integer equivalent to 40.5)\n\nTo find the integer equivalent, we can multiply both numerator and denominator by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 11:\n\n2 * 40.5 ≡ 81 (mod 11)\n2⁻¹ (mod 11) = 6 (mod 11) (Since 2 * 6 ≡ 1 (mod 11))\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 6:\n\n6 * 2 * 40.5 ≡ 6 * 81 (mod 11)\nλ ≡ 486 (mod 11)\nλ = 2 (mod 11) (Since 486 ≡ 2 (mod 11))\n\nNow, we can compute x₃ and y₃:\n\nx₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂ (mod p)\nx₃ = 2² - 5 - 5 (mod 11)\nx₃ = 4 - 10 (mod 11)\nx₃ = -6 (mod 11)\nx₃ = 5 (mod 11) (Since -6 ≡ 5 (mod 11))\n\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod p)\ny₃ = 2(5 - 5) - 1 (mod 11)\ny₃ = 0 - 1 (mod 11)\ny₃ = -1 (mod 11)\ny₃ = 10 (mod 11) (Since -1 ≡ 10 (mod 11))\n\nSo, Q = 2P = (x₃, y₃) = (5, 10)."
