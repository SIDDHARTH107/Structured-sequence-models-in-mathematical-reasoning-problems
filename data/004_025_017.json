    "message_1": "A steel ball is dropped from the top of a building that is 100 meters tall. Using calculus, determine the velocity of the ball when it hits the ground, assuming that air resistance is negligible. (Use acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s²)",
    "message_2": "To determine the velocity of the ball when it hits the ground, we can use the following equation from calculus:\n\nv(t) = v0 + ∫a(t) dt\n\nwhere v(t) is the velocity at time t, v0 is the initial velocity, a(t) is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time it takes for the ball to fall to the ground.\n\nSince the ball is dropped from rest, the initial velocity v0 is 0 m/s. The acceleration due to gravity is constant, so a(t) = -9.8 m/s² (negative because it's acting downward).\n\nNow we need to find the time it takes for the ball to fall to the ground. We can use the equation for displacement:\n\ns(t) = s0 + v0*t + 0.5*a*t²\n\nwhere s(t) is the displacement at time t, s0 is the initial displacement, and t is the time. The initial displacement s0 is 100 meters, and the final displacement when the ball hits the ground is 0 meters.\n\n0 = 100 + 0*t - 0.5*9.8*t²\n0 = 100 - 4.9*t²\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\n4.9*t² = 100\nt² = 100/4.9\nt² ≈ 20.41\nt ≈ √20.41\nt ≈ 4.52 seconds\n\nNow that we have the time it takes for the ball to fall, we can find the velocity when it hits the ground:\n\nv(t) = v0 + ∫a(t) dt\nv(4.52) = 0 + (-9.8) * 4.52\nv(4.52) ≈ -44.3 m/s\n\nThe velocity of the ball when it hits the ground is approximately -44.3 m/s (negative because it's downward)."
