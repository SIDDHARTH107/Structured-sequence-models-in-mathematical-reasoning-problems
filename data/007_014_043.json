    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first few perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. Perfect numbers can be generated using the formula (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers.\n\nThe first seven perfect numbers are generated using the following prime values for p: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, and 19.\n\nTo find the eighth perfect number, we need to find the next prime value for p. The next prime number after 19 is 31. We can now use the formula to find the eighth perfect number:\n\n(2^(31-1)) * (2^31 - 1) = (2^30) * (2147483647) = 2305843008139952128\n\nSo, the eighth perfect number is 2,305,843,008,139,952,128."
