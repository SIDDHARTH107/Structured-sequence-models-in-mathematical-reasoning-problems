    "message_2": "A minimal model of a smooth cubic surface X in projective 3-space is a birational model that has the minimal possible number of singularities. In this case, the equation of X is given by $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0$. \n\nFirst, we can observe that X is a Fermat cubic surface, which is known to be a smooth surface. Therefore, X does not have any singularities. Since the minimal model should have the minimal possible number of singularities, X itself is already a minimal model.\n\nThus, the minimal model of X is the smooth cubic surface given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0$."
