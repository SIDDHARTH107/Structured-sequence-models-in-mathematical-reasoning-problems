    "message_1": "In a study on cancer patients, it was found that 70% of patients survive for at least 5 years after diagnosis. A sample of 50 breast cancer patients who were diagnosed 5 years ago was taken. What is the probability that less than 35 patients survived?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of patients), k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of patients who survived), p is the probability of success (in this case, the survival rate), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe want to find the probability that less than 35 patients survived, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to k = 34.\n\nP(X < 35) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 34\n\nWe know that n = 50, p = 0.7, and 1-p = 0.3. We can now plug these values into the binomial probability formula and calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to k = 34.\n\nP(X < 35) = Σ (50Ck) * (0.7^k) * (0.3)^(50-k) for k = 0 to 34\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 35) ≈ 0.1841\n\nSo, the probability that less than 35 patients survived is approximately 18.41%."
