    "message_2": "To find the volume of the sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Edge of the cube = 8 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (4 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 64 cm^3\nV = 256/3 * π cm^3\n\nSo, the exact volume of the sphere is (256/3)π cubic centimeters."
