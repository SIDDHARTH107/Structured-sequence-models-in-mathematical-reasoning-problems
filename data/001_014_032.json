    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(20), we need to find the prime factors of 20 and look for any perfect squares that can be simplified.\n\n20 can be factored into 2 × 10, and 10 can be further factored into 2 × 5. So, the prime factorization of 20 is 2 × 2 × 5.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the radical expression as:\n\n√(20) = √(2 × 2 × 5)\n\nSince 2 × 2 is a perfect square (4), we can simplify the expression further:\n\n√(20) = √(4 × 5) = √(4) × √(5) = 2√(5)\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 2√(5)."
