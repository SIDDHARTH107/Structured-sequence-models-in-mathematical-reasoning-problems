    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B, which is represented by A ∩ B. Since A = {1, 3} and B = {4, 6}, there are no elements in common between the two sets. Therefore, A ∩ B = {} (the empty set).\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C, which is represented by (A ∩ B) x C. Since A ∩ B is the empty set, the Cartesian product will also be an empty set, as there are no elements in A ∩ B to pair with elements in C.\n\nSo, (A ∩ B) x C = {}."
