    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid first-price auction, bidders submit their bids without knowing the bids of others, and the highest bidder wins the auction, paying the amount they bid. Bidders typically bid less than their true private values to avoid overpaying.\n\nHowever, to calculate the expected revenue for the seller in this scenario, we need to make some assumptions about the bidding strategies of the bidders. One common assumption is that bidders use a linear bidding strategy, where they bid a fraction of their true private value.\n\nLet's assume that each bidder bids a fraction (k) of their true private value:\n\nBidder 1: $500,000 * k\nBidder 2: $400,000 * k\nBidder 3: $350,000 * k\n\nSince Bidder 1 has the highest true private value, they will win the auction as long as their bid is higher than the bids of Bidder 2 and Bidder 3. The expected revenue for the seller would be the winning bid, which is Bidder 1's bid:\n\nExpected Revenue = $500,000 * k\n\nHowever, without more information about the bidding strategies (i.e., the value of k) or the distribution of bids, it is not possible to provide a specific expected revenue for the seller in this auction."
