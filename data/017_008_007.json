    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 8 must be isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems and the number of elements of different orders.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For a prime p, if p^k is the highest power of p dividing the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^k.\n2. All subgroups of order p^k are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of subgroups of order p^k divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nSince the order of G is 8, which is 2^3, we know by the first Sylow theorem that G has a subgroup of order 8. This subgroup must be G itself. Now, let's consider the number of elements of different orders in G.\n\n1. If G has an element of order 8, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C8. For example, G = ⟨a⟩ where a^8 = e and a has order 8.\n\n2. If G has no elements of order 8, then all non-identity elements must have order 2 or 4. If G has an element of order 4, say a, then the subgroup ⟨a⟩ has order 4. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of subgroups of order 4 must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, there can be either 1 or 4 subgroups of order 4. If there is only 1 subgroup of order 4, then G is isomorphic to D4. For example, G = ⟨a, b⟩ where a^4 = b^2 = e and ab = ba^3.\n\n3. If G has no elements of order 8 or 4, then all non-identity elements have order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to Q8. For example, G = ⟨a, b⟩ where a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e and ab = ba^(-1).\n\nThus, any group G of order 8 must be isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4.\n\nExamples of groups G of order 8 that are isomorphic to each of the three possible groups:\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8, G = ⟨a⟩ where a^8 = e.\n2. Q8: The quaternion group, G = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} with the usual quaternion multiplication rules.\n3. D4: The dihedral group of order 8, G = ⟨a, b⟩ where a^4 = b^2 = e and ab = ba^3. This group represents the symmetries of a square."
