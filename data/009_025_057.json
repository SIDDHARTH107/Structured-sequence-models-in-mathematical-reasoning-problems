Consider a European call option with a strike price of $110 and an expiration of 6 months. Use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to determine the price of the option.",
    "message_2": "To determine the price of the European call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we need to first define the variables:\n\nS = current stock price = $100\nK = strike price = $110\nT = time to expiration = 0.5 years (6 months)\nr = continuously compounded annualized rate of return = 0.05\nσ = volatility = 0.30\n\nThe Black-Scholes-Merton equation for the price of a European call option is given by:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nN(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne is the base of the natural logarithm\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + (0.30^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.30 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ -0.0349\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.30 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 ≈ -0.2149\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2) using the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution:\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.4840\nN(d2) ≈ 0.4152\n\nFinally, we can calculate the price of the European call option:\n\nC = 100 * 0.4840 - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) * 0.4152\nC ≈ 48.40 - 110 * 0.9753 * 0.4152\nC ≈ 48.40 - 44.54\n\nC ≈ $3.86\n\nTherefore, the price of the European call option is approximately $3.86."
