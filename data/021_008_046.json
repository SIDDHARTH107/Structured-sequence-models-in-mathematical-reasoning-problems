    "message_2": "To use Newton's method for solving a system of nonlinear equations, we need to find the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. Let's denote the given system of equations as:\n\nF(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)) = (x² + y² - 25, x² - y² - 7)\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x  2y |\n          | 2x -2y |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, J^(-1)(x, y):\n\nJ^(-1)(x, y) = (1/det(J(x, y))) * |  -2y  -2y |\n                                   | -2x   2x |\n\nwhere det(J(x, y)) = (2x)(-2y) - (2y)(2x) = -4x² + 4x² = 0.\n\nSince the determinant is 0, the Jacobian matrix is singular, and its inverse does not exist. Therefore, we cannot use Newton's method directly to solve this system of nonlinear equations.\n\nHowever, we can try to solve the system using a different approach. Let's rewrite the first equation as:\n\ny² = 25 - x²\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\nx² - (25 - x²) - 7 = 0\n2x² - 18 = 0\nx² = 9\nx = ±3\n\nNow, substitute the values of x back into the equation for y²:\n\nFor x = 3:\ny² = 25 - 3² = 16\ny = ±4\n\nFor x = -3:\ny² = 25 - (-3)² = 16\ny = ±4\n\nSo, we have four solutions for the system of equations: (3, 4), (3, -4), (-3, 4), and (-3, -4)."
