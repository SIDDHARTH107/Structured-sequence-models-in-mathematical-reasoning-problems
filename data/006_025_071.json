    "message_1": "A magician has a deck of cards, which contains 26 red cards and 26 black cards. The magician will randomly choose one card from the deck and then put it back before choosing another. Find the probability that the magician will choose a red card followed by a black card. Round your answer to four decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of choosing a red card followed by a black card, we need to multiply the probability of choosing a red card with the probability of choosing a black card.\n\nThere are 26 red cards and 52 total cards in the deck, so the probability of choosing a red card is 26/52, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nThere are 26 black cards and 52 total cards in the deck, so the probability of choosing a black card is 26/52, which also simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nSo, the probability of choosing a red card followed by a black card is 0.25 or 25%."
