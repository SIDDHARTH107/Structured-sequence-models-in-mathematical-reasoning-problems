    "message_2": "The divisibility rule for 9 states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nLet's apply this rule to the number 3456:\n\n3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18\n\nSince 18 is divisible by 9, we can conclude that 3456 is also divisible by 9. Therefore, the remainder when 3456 is divided by 9 is 0."
