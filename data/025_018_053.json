Let $D$ be a divisor on the quintic threefold, given by the hypersurface $z=0$, where $(x_0:x_1:x_2:x_3:x_4:z)$ are the homogeneous coordinates of $\\mathbb{P}^5$. Compute the degree of the class of $D$ in the Mori cone of curves $\\overline{NE}(X)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the class of $D$ in the Mori cone of curves $\\overline{NE}(X)$, we first need to find the intersection number of $D$ with a curve in the quintic threefold $X$. \n\nLet $C$ be a curve in $X$ that is not contained in $D$. We can represent $C$ as the complete intersection of $X$ with another hypersurface $H$ of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^5$. The intersection number $D \\cdot C$ is then given by the degree of the complete intersection of $X$, $D$, and $H$ in $\\mathbb{P}^5$. \n\nSince $X$ is a quintic threefold, its degree is $5$. The divisor $D$ is given by the hypersurface $z=0$, which is a hyperplane in $\\mathbb{P}^5$, so its degree is $1$. Thus, the intersection number $D \\cdot C$ is given by the degree of the complete intersection of a quintic, a hyperplane, and a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^5$. \n\nBy the adjunction formula, the degree of this complete intersection is given by $(5-1)(d-1) = 4(d-1)$. Therefore, the degree of the class of $D$ in the Mori cone of curves $\\overline{NE}(X)$ is $4(d-1)$."
