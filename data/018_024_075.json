    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, represented as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {3, 4, 5}\nIntersection of A and B: A ∩ B = {3}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA △ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 2} ∪ {4, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of this set, represented as (A △ B)'.\n\nTo find the complement of a set, we need to know the universal set. Since the problem doesn't provide a universal set, we can assume it's the set of all elements in A and B:\n\nUniversal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the complement of (A △ B):\n\n(A △ B)' = U - (A △ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 4, 5} = {3}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A and B:\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 3} = {4, 5}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B', represented as (A' △ B'):\n\nA' △ B' = (A' - B') ∪ (B' - A') = {4, 5} ∪ {1, 2} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we can compare (A △ B)' and (A' △ B'):\n\n(A △ B)' = {3}\n(A' △ B') = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nSince (A △ B)' ≠ (A' △ B'), we have shown that the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B is not equal to the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B."
