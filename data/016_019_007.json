    "message_1": "If the original Koch island has a perimeter of 12 cm, what will be the perimeter of the island after the fourth iteration of the construction process? Assume that the length of each side of the equilateral triangle used in the construction of the Koch curve is 1 cm.",
    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve construction process to each side of an equilateral triangle. In the first iteration, each side of the triangle is replaced with a Koch curve, which consists of 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original side.\n\nThe perimeter of the original Koch island is 12 cm, so each side of the equilateral triangle is 12 cm / 3 = 4 cm.\n\nAfter the first iteration, each side is replaced with 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original side (4 cm / 3 = 4/3 cm). So, the new perimeter after the first iteration is 3 sides * 4 segments per side * (4/3) cm per segment = 16 cm.\n\nIn each subsequent iteration, the number of segments per side is multiplied by 4, and the length of each segment is divided by 3. After the fourth iteration, the number of segments per side is 4^4 = 256, and the length of each segment is (4/3) * (1/3)^3 = 4/81 cm.\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch island after the fourth iteration is 3 sides * 256 segments per side * (4/81) cm per segment = 3072/81 cm â‰ˆ 37.93 cm."
