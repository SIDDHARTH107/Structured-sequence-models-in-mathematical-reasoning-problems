    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and the corresponding principal directions at the point (1, 2, -3), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nGiven the surface equation: z = 3x^2 + 2y^2 - 6x - 4y + 1\n\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∂z/∂x = 6x - 6\n∂z/∂y = 4y - 4\n\nAt the point (1, 2, -3), these partial derivatives are:\n\n∂z/∂x = 0\n∂z/∂y = 4\n\nNow, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 6\n∂²z/∂y² = 4\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = | E  F |\n    | F  G |\n\nwhere E = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2, F = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y), and G = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2.\n\nAt the point (1, 2, -3), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 0^2 = 1\nF = 0 * 4 = 0\nG = 1 + 4^2 = 17\n\nSo, the first fundamental form is:\n\nI = | 1  0 |\n    | 0  17 |\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = | L  M |\n     | M  N |\n\nwhere L = ∂²z/∂x², M = ∂²z/∂x∂y, and N = ∂²z/∂y².\n\nAt the point (1, 2, -3), we have:\n\nL = 6\nM = 0\nN = 4\n\nSo, the second fundamental form is:\n\nII = | 6  0 |\n     | 0  4 |\n\nNow, we find the principal curvatures, k1 and k2, which are the eigenvalues of the matrix product (I^(-1) * II):\n\nI^(-1) = | 1/1  0   |\n         | 0    1/17 |\n\nI^(-1) * II = | 6  0  |\n              | 0  4/17 |\n\nThe eigenvalues (principal curvatures) are k1 = 6 and k2 = 4/17.\n\nFinally, we find the corresponding principal directions, which are the eigenvectors of the matrix (I^(-1) * II):\n\nFor k1 = 6:\n\n(I^(-1) * II - 6I) * v1 = 0\n\n| 0  0 | * | x1 | = | 0 |\n| 0  -2 |   | y1 |   | 0 |\n\nv1 = (1, 0)\n\nFor k2 = 4/17:\n\n(I^(-1) * II - 4/17I) * v2 = 0\n\n| 10/17  0 | * | x2 | = | 0 |\n| 0    0   |   | y2 |   | 0 |\n\nv2 = (0, 1)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, 2, -3) are k1 = 6 and k2 = 4/17, and the corresponding principal directions are v1 = (1, 0) and v2 = (0, 1)."
