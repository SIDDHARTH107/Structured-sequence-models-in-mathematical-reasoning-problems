    "message_1": "A particle moves along a curve given by the equation\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx = 2\\cos t\\\\\ny = 2\\sin t\\\\\nz = t\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith $t$ ranging from $0$ to $\\pi$. A vector $v = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$ is initially tangent to the curve at $t=0$. Determine the parallel transport of $v$ along the curve, and find the final direction of $v$ when it reaches $t=\\pi$.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $v$ along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve at any point $t$. We can do this by taking the derivative of the curve with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\\\y(t)\\\\z(t)\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\sin t\\\\2\\cos t\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the transported vector $v(t)$ remains tangent to the curve at every point. This means that the derivative of $v(t)$ with respect to $t$ should be proportional to the tangent vector of the curve:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}v(t) = \\lambda(t) \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\sin t\\\\2\\cos t\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda(t)$ is a scalar function of $t$. The condition for parallel transport is that the covariant derivative of $v(t)$ along the curve is zero, which means that the change in $v(t)$ is only due to the change in the direction of the curve:\n\n$$\n\\frac{D}{dt}v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}v(t) - \\lambda(t) \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\sin t\\\\2\\cos t\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n\nNow, let's write $v(t)$ as:\n\n$$\nv(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}a(t)\\\\b(t)\\\\c(t)\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}v(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}a'(t)\\\\b'(t)\\\\c'(t)\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the covariant derivative, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}a'(t)\\\\b'(t)\\\\c'(t)\\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda(t) \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\sin t\\\\2\\cos t\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations for $a'(t)$, $b'(t)$, and $c'(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na'(t) = -2\\lambda(t)\\sin t\\\\\nb'(t) = 2\\lambda(t)\\cos t\\\\\nc'(t) = \\lambda(t)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, we can integrate each equation with respect to $t$ to find $a(t)$, $b(t)$, and $c(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na(t) = -2\\int \\lambda(t)\\sin t dt + A\\\\\nb(t) = 2\\int \\lambda(t)\\cos t dt + B\\\\\nc(t) = \\int \\lambda(t) dt + C\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants of integration. Since $v(0) = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$, we can find the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nA = 3\\\\\nB = 5\\\\\nC = 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThus, the transported vector $v(t)$ is given by:\n\n$$\nv(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\int \\lambda(t)\\sin t dt + 3\\\\2\\int \\lambda(t)\\cos t dt + 5\\\\\\int \\lambda(t) dt + 1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo find the final direction of $v$ when it reaches $t=\\pi$, we need to evaluate $v(\\pi)$. However, we don't have enough information to determine the function $\\lambda(t)$. In general, the parallel transport of a vector along a curve depends on the connection (or covariant derivative) used, which is determined by the geometry of the space in which the curve is embedded. Without more information about the geometry or the connection, we cannot find the exact expression for $v(t)$ or its final direction at $t=\\pi$."
