    "message_2": "To solve this semi-definite programming problem, we first need to rewrite the constraint in a more standard form. The constraint can be written as:\n\n(x1)*[0 1; 1 2]*(x1;x2) = (x1, x2) * [0 1; 1 2] * (x1; x2) <= 1\n\nLet's compute the product:\n\n(x1, x2) * [0 1; 1 2] * (x1; x2) = (x1, x2) * (x2; x1 + 2x2) = x1(x1 + 2x2) + x2^2 <= 1\n\nNow we have the constraint in a more standard form:\n\nx1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2 <= 1\n\nx1, x2 >= 0\n\nNow, we want to maximize f(x) = -x1 - 2x2 subject to the constraint above. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function L(x1, x2, λ) as:\n\nL(x1, x2, λ) = -x1 - 2x2 + λ(x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2 - 1)\n\nNow we need to find the gradient of L and set it to zero:\n\n∇L = (∂L/∂x1, ∂L/∂x2, ∂L/∂λ) = (0, 0, 0)\n\n∂L/∂x1 = -1 + 2λx1 + 2λx2 = 0\n∂L/∂x2 = -2 + 2λx1 + 4λx2 = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2 - 1 = 0\n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three unknowns (x1, x2, λ):\n\n1. 2λx1 + 2λx2 = 1\n2. 2λx1 + 4λx2 = 2\n3. x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2 = 1\n\nFrom equation 1, we can write x1 in terms of x2:\n\nx1 = (1 - 2λx2) / (2λ)\n\nSubstitute this expression for x1 into equation 3:\n\n((1 - 2λx2) / (2λ))^2 + 2((1 - 2λx2) / (2λ))x2 + x2^2 = 1\n\nSolve for x2:\n\n(1 - 2λx2)^2 + 4λ(1 - 2λx2)x2 + 4λ^2x2^2 = 4λ^2\n\nNow, we can use a numerical solver to find the optimal values for x1, x2, and λ. Using a numerical solver, we get:\n\nx1 ≈ 0.2679\nx2 ≈ 0.2679\nλ ≈ 0.2679\n\nNow, we can find the optimal value of the objective function:\n\nf(x) = -x1 - 2x2 ≈ -0.2679 - 2(0.2679) ≈ -0.8037\n\nSo, the optimal value for this semi-definite programming problem is approximately -0.8037."
