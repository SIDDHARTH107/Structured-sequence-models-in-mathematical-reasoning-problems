    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system.\n2. Use row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (also called row-echelon form).\n3. Solve the resulting triangular system using back-substitution.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system.\n\n[ 2  3 -1 |  4 ]\n[ 1 -2  1 | -1 ]\n[ 3 -1  2 |  5 ]\n\nStep 2: Transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix using row operations.\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate the x term in the second and third rows. To do this, we'll replace the second row with (-1/2) * (first row) + (second row) and replace the third row with (-3/2) * (first row) + (third row).\n\n[  2   3  -1 |   4  ]\n[  0  -4   2 |  -3  ]\n[  0  -5.5  3.5 | -1  ]\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the y term in the third row. To do this, we'll replace the third row with (-5.5/4) * (second row) + (third row).\n\n[  2    3   -1  |   4   ]\n[  0   -4    2  |  -3   ]\n[  0    0   -0.5 |   0.5 ]\n\nStep 3: Solve the resulting triangular system using back-substitution.\n\nWe now have the following triangular system:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 4\n-4y + 2z = -3\n-0.5z = 0.5\n\nFirst, we'll solve for z: -0.5z = 0.5 => z = -1\n\nNext, we'll solve for y using the second equation: -4y + 2(-1) = -3 => y = 1\n\nFinally, we'll solve for x using the first equation: 2x + 3(1) - (-1) = 4 => x = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 1, and z = -1."
