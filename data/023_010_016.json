    "message_2": "When you apply the two-dimensional Fourier transform to an image with dimensions of 512 x 512 pixels, you will obtain a transformed image of the same dimensions, i.e., 512 x 512. Each element in the transformed image will be a complex number. Therefore, the resulting magnitude spectrum will contain:\n\n512 x 512 = 262,144 complex numbers."
