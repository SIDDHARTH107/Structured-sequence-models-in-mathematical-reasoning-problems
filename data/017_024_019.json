    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 96 exist, and can you provide an example of one such group?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find the number of all groups of order 96 and then subtract the number of abelian groups of order 96.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nNumber of groups of order 96 = (p(5) * p(1)) = (7 * 2) = 14\n\nNow, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 96. Abelian groups of order 96 are direct products of cyclic groups of orders that multiply to 96. The possible abelian groups are:\n\n1. Z_96\n2. Z_48 × Z_2\n3. Z_32 × Z_3\n4. Z_24 × Z_4\n5. Z_16 × Z_6\n6. Z_12 × Z_8\n7. Z_8 × Z_4 × Z_3\n\nThere are 7 abelian groups of order 96. Therefore, the number of non-abelian groups of order 96 is:\n\nNumber of non-abelian groups of order 96 = (Total number of groups) - (Number of abelian groups) = 14 - 7 = 7\n\nThere are 7 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nAn example of a non-abelian group of order 96 is the semidirect product of Z_32 and Z_3, denoted as Z_32 ⋊ Z_3. This group is non-abelian because the semidirect product of two non-trivial groups is non-abelian when the action of one group on the other is non-trivial."
