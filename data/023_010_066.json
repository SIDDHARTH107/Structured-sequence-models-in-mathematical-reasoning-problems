    "message_1": "Consider an image size of 256 x 256 pixels with values in the range [0, 255]. Apply the 2D Fourier transform to this image and find the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients at frequency indices (50, 80) and (120, 200). Round the values to the nearest integer.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients at specific frequency indices, we need to know the values of the image pixels. Since the pixel values are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact magnitudes of the Fourier coefficients at the given frequency indices.\n\nHowever, if you provide the pixel values of the image, I can help you calculate the magnitudes of the Fourier coefficients at the specified frequency indices."
