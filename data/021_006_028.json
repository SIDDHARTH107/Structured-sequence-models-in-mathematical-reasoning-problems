    "message_1": "Consider the 2D Poisson equation:\n\n∇²u = f\n\nwhere u(x,y) is an unknown function to be determined on a rectangular domain defined by [0,L] × [0,W]. \n\nSuppose that f(x,y) = 10xy in the domain. Using finite element method with linear triangular elements, find the approximate solution u(x,y) of the equation with the following boundary conditions:\n\nu(x,0) = x^2 - 2x + 1\nu(x,W) = x^2 - 4x + 4\nu(0,y) = y^2 - 2y + 1\nu(L,y) = y^2 - 4y + 4\n\nTake L = W = 1.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given 2D Poisson equation using the finite element method (FEM) with linear triangular elements, we first need to discretize the domain and set up the weak formulation of the problem.\n\n1. Discretize the domain: Since L = W = 1, we have a unit square domain. Divide the domain into triangular elements. For simplicity, let's consider a 2x2 mesh, which results in 8 triangular elements.\n\n2. Weak formulation: Multiply the Poisson equation by a test function v(x,y) and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫∫(∇²u * v) dxdy = ∫∫(f * v) dxdy\n\nIntegrate by parts to obtain:\n\n-∫∫(∇u * ∇v) dxdy + ∫(v * ∂u/∂n) ds = ∫∫(f * v) dxdy\n\nwhere ∂u/∂n is the normal derivative on the boundary and the second term represents the boundary integral.\n\n3. FEM formulation: Approximate the solution u(x,y) and the test function v(x,y) using linear basis functions on the triangular elements. Let N_i(x,y) be the linear basis functions, then:\n\nu(x,y) ≈ Σ U_i * N_i(x,y)\nv(x,y) ≈ Σ V_i * N_i(x,y)\n\nSubstitute these approximations into the weak formulation and apply the Galerkin method (set V_i = N_i):\n\n-∫∫(∇(Σ U_i * N_i) * ∇(Σ N_i)) dxdy + ∫(Σ N_i * ∂(Σ U_i * N_i)/∂n) ds = ∫∫(f * Σ N_i) dxdy\n\n4. Assembly: Assemble the global stiffness matrix K and the global force vector F:\n\nK_ij = ∫∫(∇N_i * ∇N_j) dxdy\nF_i = ∫∫(f * N_i) dxdy - ∫(N_i * ∂u/∂n) ds\n\n5. Apply boundary conditions: Since we have Dirichlet boundary conditions, we can directly substitute the given boundary conditions into the corresponding rows and columns of the stiffness matrix and force vector.\n\n6. Solve the linear system: Solve the linear system KU = F for the unknown coefficients U_i.\n\n7. Compute the approximate solution: Substitute the obtained coefficients U_i back into the approximation u(x,y) ≈ Σ U_i * N_i(x,y) to get the approximate solution.\n\nNote that this is a general outline of the FEM procedure for the given problem. To obtain the actual numerical solution, you would need to perform the integrations and solve the linear system using a suitable numerical method or software."
