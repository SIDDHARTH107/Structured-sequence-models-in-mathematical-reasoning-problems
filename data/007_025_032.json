    "message_1": "Using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, suppose Alice chooses a prime number p=29 and a base g=2, while Bob chooses a prime number p=31 and a base g=3. If Alice's secret number is x=5 and Bob's secret number is y=7, what is the shared secret key that they can use to encrypt and decrypt messages securely?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice and Bob agree on a common prime number p and a base g. In this case, we have two different prime numbers (p=29 and p=31) and two different bases (g=2 and g=3). They need to agree on one set of p and g. Let's assume they agree on p=29 and g=2.\n\n2. Alice calculates A = g^x mod p, where x is her secret number. In this case, A = 2^5 mod 29 = 32 mod 29 = 3.\n\n3. Bob calculates B = g^y mod p, where y is his secret number. In this case, B = 2^7 mod 29 = 128 mod 29 = 12.\n\n4. Alice and Bob exchange their calculated values A and B.\n\n5. Alice calculates the shared secret key as K_A = B^x mod p. In this case, K_A = 12^5 mod 29 = 248832 mod 29 = 16.\n\n6. Bob calculates the shared secret key as K_B = A^y mod p. In this case, K_B = 3^7 mod 29 = 2187 mod 29 = 16.\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, the shared secret key is 16. Alice and Bob can now use this key to encrypt and decrypt messages securely."
