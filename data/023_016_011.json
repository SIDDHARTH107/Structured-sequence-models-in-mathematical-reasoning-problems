    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x) over the interval -4 ≤ x < 4, we first need to determine the period of the function. Since the function repeats every 4 units, the period is T = 4.\n\nThe Fourier series of a function can be represented as:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * ω * x) + b_n * sin(n * ω * x)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π / T, a_0 is the constant term, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / T) * ∫[f(x) dx] over one period\n\nSince the function is defined piecewise, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1 / 4) * [∫[1 dx] from 0 to 2 + ∫[-1 dx] from 2 to 4]\n\na_0 = (1 / 4) * [(x) from 0 to 2 + (-x) from 2 to 4]\n\na_0 = (1 / 4) * [(2 - 0) + (2 - 4)]\n\na_0 = (1 / 4) * (2 - 2) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n:\n\na_n = (2 / T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * ω * x) dx] over one period\n\nb_n = (2 / T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * ω * x) dx] over one period\n\nAgain, we need to split the integrals into two parts:\n\na_n = (1 / 2) * [∫[cos(n * π * x) dx] from 0 to 2 + ∫[-cos(n * π * x) dx] from 2 to 4]\n\nb_n = (1 / 2) * [∫[sin(n * π * x) dx] from 0 to 2 + ∫[-sin(n * π * x) dx] from 2 to 4]\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\na_n = (1 / 2) * [(1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x) from 0 to 2 + (-1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x) from 2 to 4]\n\nb_n = (1 / 2) * [(-1 / (n * π)) * cos(n * π * x) from 0 to 2 + (1 / (n * π)) * cos(n * π * x) from 2 to 4]\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\na_n = (1 / (n * π)) * [sin(2 * n * π) - sin(0) - sin(4 * n * π) + sin(2 * n * π)] = 0 (since sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer n)\n\nb_n = (1 / (n * π)) * [-cos(2 * n * π) + cos(0) + cos(4 * n * π) - cos(2 * n * π)]\n\nSince cos(2 * n * π) = 1 for all integer n, we have:\n\nb_n = (1 / (n * π)) * [2 - 2 * cos(2 * n * π)] = (2 / (n * π)) * (1 - cos(2 * n * π))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series of f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2 / (n * π)) * (1 - cos(2 * n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series of f(x) over the interval -4 ≤ x < 4 using trigonometric functions."
