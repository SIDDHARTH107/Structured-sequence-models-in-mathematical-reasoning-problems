    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of both sets A and B, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element in sets A and B.\n\nLet the empty set be denoted as ∅. By definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in sets A and B.\n\nIn set theory, a set C is considered a subset of another set D (denoted as C ⊆ D) if every element of C is also an element of D. Since there are no elements in the empty set that are not in sets A and B, we can conclude that the empty set is a subset of both sets A and B.\n\nThus, ∅ ⊆ A and ∅ ⊆ B."
