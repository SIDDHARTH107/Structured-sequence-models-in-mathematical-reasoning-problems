    "message_2": "To find the poles of the function $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator of the function is equal to zero. In other words, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$$5z^2 + 1 = 0$$\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$$5z^2 = -1$$\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n$$z^2 = -\\frac{1}{5}$$\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\n$$z = \\pm \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{5}}$$\n\nSince we have a square root of a negative number, we can rewrite it in terms of imaginary numbers:\n\n$$z = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}i$$\n\nSo, the poles of the function $f(z)$ are $z = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}i$ and $z = -\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}i$.\n\nNow, let's find the order of these poles. The order of a pole is the number of times it appears as a root of the denominator. In this case, the denominator is a quadratic polynomial, so each root can appear at most twice. However, since the roots are distinct, each pole has an order of 1.\n\nTherefore, the poles of $f(z)$ are $z = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}i$ and $z = -\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}i$, both with order 1."
