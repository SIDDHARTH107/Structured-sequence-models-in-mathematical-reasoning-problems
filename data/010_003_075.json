    "message_2": "To determine if the topological space (X, T) is a Hausdorff space (also known as a T2 space), we need to check if for any two distinct points x, y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U, V in T such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nLet's consider the points a and c in X. We need to find open sets U and V in T such that a ∈ U, c ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nLooking at the topology T, we can see that there are no disjoint open sets containing a and c, respectively. The open sets containing a are {a, b} and {a, b, c}, and the open sets containing c are {b, c} and {a, b, c}. All of these open sets have a non-empty intersection, so we cannot find disjoint open sets U and V for the points a and c.\n\nTherefore, the topological space (X, T) is not a Hausdorff space."
