    "message_2": "Given f(z) = z^3 - 3z, where z = x + iy, we can first find the real part u(x, y) by substituting z = x + iy into the function:\n\nf(x + iy) = (x + iy)^3 - 3(x + iy)\n= (x^3 + 3ix^2y - 3xy^2 - iy^3) - 3x - 3iy\n= (x^3 - 3xy^2 - 3x) + i(3x^2y - y^3 - 3y)\n\nNow, we can see that u(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 - 3x and v(x, y) = 3x^2y - y^3 - 3y.\n\nSince u(x, y) is given to be a harmonic function, it satisfies the Laplace equation:\n\n∆u = (∂^2u/∂x^2) + (∂^2u/∂y^2) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the second partial derivatives of u(x, y):\n\n∂^2u/∂x^2 = ∂/∂x(3x^2 - 3y^2 - 3) = 6x\n∂^2u/∂y^2 = ∂/∂y(-6xy) = -6x\n\nNow, substituting these into the Laplace equation:\n\n∆u = (6x) + (-6x) = 0\n\nSince u(x, y) is harmonic, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find v(x, y):\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nNow, we can find the first partial derivatives of u(x, y) and v(x, y):\n\n∂u/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y^2 - 3\n∂u/∂y = -6xy\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find the partial derivatives of v(x, y):\n\n∂v/∂y = 3x^2 - 3y^2 - 3\n-∂v/∂x = -6xy\n\nNow, we can integrate these partial derivatives to find v(x, y):\n\nv(x, y) = ∫(3x^2 - 3y^2 - 3) dy = 3x^2y - y^3 - 3y + g(x)\n\nNow, we can differentiate v(x, y) with respect to x and compare it with -∂u/∂y:\n\n∂v/∂x = 6xy + g'(x)\n\nSince -∂u/∂y = -6xy, we have:\n\n6xy + g'(x) = -6xy\n\nThis implies that g'(x) = -12xy. Now, we can integrate g'(x) to find g(x):\n\ng(x) = ∫(-12xy) dx = -6x^2 + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we can substitute g(x) back into v(x, y):\n\nv(x, y) = 3x^2y - y^3 - 3y - 6x^2 + C\n\nThus, the function v(x, y) is given by:\n\nv(x, y) = 3x^2y - y^3 - 3y - 6x^2 + C"
