Starting at x = -5, determine the optimal values of x that minimize the function to the nearest hundredth.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the conjugate gradient method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the gradient of the function f(x).\n2. Choose an initial guess for x.\n3. Compute the search direction.\n4. Update the guess for x.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until convergence.\n\nStep 1: Compute the gradient of the function f(x)\nThe gradient of f(x) = 2x^2 + 8x - 20 is the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x. So, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 + 8x - 20)/dx = 4x + 8\n\nStep 2: Choose an initial guess for x\nWe are given the initial guess x = -5.\n\nStep 3: Compute the search direction\nThe search direction is the negative of the gradient at the current guess. So, for our initial guess x = -5, the search direction is:\n\nsearch_direction = -f'(-5) = -(4*(-5) + 8) = -(-12) = 12\n\nStep 4: Update the guess for x\nTo update the guess for x, we need to find the optimal step size α that minimizes the function along the search direction. To do this, we can use the line search method. We have:\n\nx_new = x_old + α * search_direction\n\nSubstitute the function f(x) and the search direction into the equation:\n\nf(x_old + α * search_direction) = 2(x_old + α * search_direction)^2 + 8(x_old + α * search_direction) - 20\n\nNow, we need to find the α that minimizes this function. To do this, we can take the derivative of the function with respect to α and set it to zero:\n\nd(f(x_old + α * search_direction))/dα = 0\n\nDifferentiate the function with respect to α:\n\n4(x_old + α * search_direction) + 8 = 0\n\nSolve for α:\n\nα = -(4 * x_old + 8) / (4 * search_direction)\n\nFor our initial guess x = -5 and search_direction = 12, we have:\n\nα = -(-20) / (4 * 12) = 20 / 48 ≈ 0.42\n\nNow, update the guess for x:\n\nx_new = x_old + α * search_direction = -5 + 0.42 * 12 ≈ -5 + 5.04 = 0.04\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until convergence\nSince we have already reached the nearest hundredth, we can stop here. The optimal value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 8x - 20 using the conjugate gradient method is approximately x = 0.04."
