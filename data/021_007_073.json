    "message_2": "To find the positive root of the equation x^3 - 2x - 5 = 0 using the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method formula is:\n\nx_new = x_old - f(x_old) / f'(x_old)\n\nWe'll start with an initial guess for the positive root, x_old = 2 (since 2^3 - 2*2 - 5 is close to 0). Then, we'll iterate using the formula until we reach the desired precision of four decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nx_new = 2 - (2^3 - 2*2 - 5) / (3*(2^2) - 2)\nx_new = 2 - (3) / (10)\nx_new = 1.7\n\nIteration 2:\nx_new = 1.7 - (1.7^3 - 2*1.7 - 5) / (3*(1.7^2) - 2)\nx_new = 1.7 - (-0.653) / (8.69)\nx_new ≈ 1.7749\n\nIteration 3:\nx_new = 1.7749 - (1.7749^3 - 2*1.7749 - 5) / (3*(1.7749^2) - 2)\nx_new ≈ 1.7749 - (-0.0257) / (9.4211)\nx_new ≈ 1.7773\n\nIteration 4:\nx_new = 1.7773 - (1.7773^3 - 2*1.7773 - 5) / (3*(1.7773^2) - 2)\nx_new ≈ 1.7773 - (-0.0001) / (9.4786)\nx_new ≈ 1.7774\n\nSince the difference between the last two iterations is less than 0.0001, we can stop here. The positive root of the equation x^3 - 2x - 5 = 0, correct to four decimal places, is approximately 1.7774."
