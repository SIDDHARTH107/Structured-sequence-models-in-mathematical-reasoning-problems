    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:\n\n(18x + 30y) / 6 = 42 / 6\n\n3x + 5y = 7\n\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for x and y. To do this, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the Bezout's coefficients for 3 and 5, which are integers s and t such that:\n\n3s + 5t = gcd(3, 5)\n\nSince gcd(3, 5) = 1, we can find s and t:\n\ns = 2, t = -1\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation 3x + 5y = 7 by the gcd(3, 5):\n\n3(2) + 5(-1) = 1\n\n6 - 5 = 1\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 7:\n\n7(6 - 5) = 7\n\n42 - 35 = 7\n\nSo, one particular solution for the Diophantine equation is x = 7 and y = -7.\n\nNow, we can find the general solution by using the formula:\n\nx = x0 + (n * b) / gcd(a, b)\ny = y0 - (n * a) / gcd(a, b)\n\nWhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions we found (7 and -7), a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the simplified equation (3 and 5), gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b (1), and n is an integer.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nx = 7 + 5n\ny = -7 - 3n\n\nFor any integer n."
