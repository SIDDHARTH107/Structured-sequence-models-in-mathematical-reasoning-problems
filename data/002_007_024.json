    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and the lengths of its two bases are 12 cm and 18 cm respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 is 12 cm, base2 is 18 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 18) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (30) * 8\nArea = 15 * 8\nArea = 120 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 120 square centimeters."
