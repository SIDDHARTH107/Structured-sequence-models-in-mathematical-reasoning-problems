    "message_2": "An independent set of nodes in a graph is a set of nodes where no two nodes are adjacent (connected by an edge). To find the maximum number of independent nodes that can be selected from this graph, we can use a greedy algorithm.\n\nFirst, let's list the nodes and their degrees (number of edges connected to them):\n1: degree 3 (connected to 4, 5, 6)\n2: degree 3 (connected to 4, 5, 8)\n3: degree 3 (connected to 5, 6, 8)\n4: degree 2 (connected to 1, 2)\n5: degree 4 (connected to 1, 2, 3, 8)\n6: degree 3 (connected to 1, 3, 7)\n7: degree 1 (connected to 6)\n8: degree 3 (connected to 2, 3, 5)\n\nNow, let's try to find the maximum independent set:\n1. Choose node 7 (degree 1) and remove its adjacent node 6.\n2. Choose node 4 (degree 2) and remove its adjacent nodes 1 and 2.\n3. Choose node 3 (degree 3) and remove its adjacent nodes 5 and 8.\n\nThe remaining independent set is {3, 4, 7}, with a total of 3 nodes. This is the maximum number of independent nodes that can be selected from this graph."
