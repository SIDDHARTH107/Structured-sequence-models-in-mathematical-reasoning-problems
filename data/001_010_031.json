    "message_2": "We are given x = 2 and y = 5, and we need to evaluate the expression 3x^2 + 4xy - y^2.\n\nFirst, substitute the values of x and y into the expression:\n\n3(2)^2 + 4(2)(5) - (5)^2\n\nNow, calculate the squares and the products:\n\n3(4) + 4(10) - 25\n\nNext, perform the multiplications:\n\n12 + 40 - 25\n\nFinally, perform the additions and subtraction:\n\n52 - 25 = 27\n\nSo, the value of the expression 3x^2 + 4xy - y^2 when x = 2 and y = 5 is 27."
