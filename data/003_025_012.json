    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the force vector in terms of i and j unit vectors, we need to break the vector into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. We can do this using trigonometry.\n\nThe horizontal component (x) can be found using the cosine function:\nFx = magnitude * cos(angle)\nFx = 20 N * cos(60°)\n\nThe vertical component (y) can be found using the sine function:\nFy = magnitude * sin(angle)\nFy = 20 N * sin(60°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n60° * (π/180) = (1/3)π radians\n\nNow, we can find the x and y components:\nFx = 20 N * cos((1/3)π) = 20 N * (1/2) = 10 N\nFy = 20 N * sin((1/3)π) = 20 N * (√3/2) = 10√3 N\n\nSo, the force vector can be represented in terms of i and j unit vectors as:\nF = 10i + 10√3j N"
