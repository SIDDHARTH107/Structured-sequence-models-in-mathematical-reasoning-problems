    "message_2": "To solve this semi-definite program, we first need to find the feasible region defined by the constraints and then optimize the objective function over this region.\n\n1. Linear constraints:\n\nThe first two constraints are linear inequalities:\n\n$$x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 3$$\n$$x_{1} - x_{2} \\leq 1$$\n\n2. Semi-definite constraint:\n\nThe third constraint is a semi-definite constraint, which requires the matrix to be positive semi-definite:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & x_{1} \\\\\nx_{1} & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\succeq 0$$\n\nA matrix is positive semi-definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are non-negative. The eigenvalues of the given matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation:\n\n$$\\text{det}(A - \\lambda I) = 0$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the given matrix, $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue, and $I$ is the identity matrix. For the given matrix, the characteristic equation is:\n\n$$(4 - \\lambda)(2 - \\lambda) - x_{1}^2 = 0$$\n\nExpanding and rearranging, we get:\n\n$$\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 8 - x_{1}^2 = 0$$\n\nFor the matrix to be positive semi-definite, both eigenvalues must be non-negative. The discriminant of the quadratic equation, $D = b^2 - 4ac$, determines the nature of the roots. If $D \\geq 0$, the roots are real, and we can check if they are non-negative. In this case:\n\n$$D = 6^2 - 4(8 - x_{1}^2) = 36 - 32 + 4x_{1}^2 = 4 + 4x_{1}^2$$\n\nSince $D \\geq 0$ for all $x_{1}$, the eigenvalues are real. Now we need to check if they are non-negative. We can use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation are given by:\n\n$$\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 6$$\n$$\\lambda_1 \\cdot \\lambda_2 = 8 - x_{1}^2$$\n\nSince $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 6 > 0$, at least one of the eigenvalues must be positive. Furthermore, the product $\\lambda_1 \\cdot \\lambda_2 = 8 - x_{1}^2 \\geq 0$ implies that both eigenvalues have the same sign. Therefore, both eigenvalues are non-negative, and the matrix is positive semi-definite for all $x_{1}$.\n\n3. Feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of the linear constraints and the semi-definite constraint. Since the semi-definite constraint is satisfied for all $x_{1}$, the feasible region is simply the intersection of the linear constraints:\n\n$$x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 3$$\n$$x_{1} - x_{2} \\leq 1$$\n\n4. Optimization:\n\nTo find the optimal value of the objective function, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. However, since this is a simple linear program, we can also solve it graphically by plotting the constraints and finding the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe linear constraints can be rewritten as:\n\n$$x_{2} \\leq 3 - x_{1}$$\n$$x_{2} \\geq x_{1} - 1$$\n\nPlotting these constraints, we find that the feasible region is a triangle with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(1, 2)$, and $(2, 1)$. The objective function can be evaluated at each vertex:\n\n$$2x_{1} + 3x_{2} = 2(0) + 3(0) = 0$$ at $(0, 0)$\n$$2x_{1} + 3x_{2} = 2(1) + 3(2) = 8$$ at $(1, 2)$\n$$2x_{1} + 3x_{2} = 2(2) + 3(1) = 7$$ at $(2, 1)$\n\nThe optimal value of the objective function is 8, and it is achieved at the point $(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (1, 2)$."
