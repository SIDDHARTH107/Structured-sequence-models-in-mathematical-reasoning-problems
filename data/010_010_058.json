    "message_2": "To apply Morse theory, we first need to find the critical points of the function $f(x, y)$. Critical points occur when the gradient of the function is equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f$ is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)$.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2(x^2 + y - 11)(2x) + 2(x + y^2 - 7)$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2(x^2 + y - 11) + 2(x + y^2 - 7)(2y)$.\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n$4x(x^2 + y - 11) + 2(x + y^2 - 7) = 0$\n\n$2(x^2 + y - 11) + 4y(x + y^2 - 7) = 0$.\n\nThis system of nonlinear equations is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the critical points. Using a numerical solver, we find that there are four critical points:\n\n1. $(x, y) \\approx (3, 2)$\n2. $(x, y) \\approx (-3.7793, -3.2832)$\n3. $(x, y) \\approx (3.5844, -1.8481)$\n4. $(x, y) \\approx (-2.8051, 3.1313)$\n\nNow that we have the critical points, we can use Morse theory to analyze the function. Morse theory states that the number of critical points is related to the topology of the underlying space. In this case, the underlying space is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which has no interesting topology (it is simply connected). Therefore, the number of critical points we found, which is 4, is the final answer.\n\nSo, there are 4 critical points of the function $f(x, y) = (x^2 + y - 11)^2 + (x + y^2 - 7)^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$."
