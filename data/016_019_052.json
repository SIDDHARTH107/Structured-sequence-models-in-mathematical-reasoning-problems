    "message_2": "A Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is a fractal that increases the length of a line segment by a factor of 4/3 with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the initial length of the Koch island as P0. In this case, P0 = 120 units.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the Koch island will be P1 = P0 * (4/3). \n\nAfter the second iteration, the length will be P2 = P1 * (4/3) = P0 * (4/3)^2.\n\nIn general, after the nth iteration, the length of the Koch island will be Pn = P0 * (4/3)^n.\n\nSo, after the 5th iteration, the total length of the Koch island will be:\n\nP5 = P0 * (4/3)^5 = 120 * (4/3)^5 = 120 * (1024/243) â‰ˆ 506.66 units."
