    "message_2": "To determine the frequency spectrum of the given signal f(t) = sin(5t) + cos(10t), we will use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the given signal:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[sin(5t) * e^(-jωt) + cos(10t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[sin(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt + ∫[cos(10t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n\n∫[sin(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = sin(5t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 5cos(5t) dt and v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt).\n\nNow, apply integration by parts:\n\nuv - ∫v du = (-sin(5t)/jω)e^(-jωt) - ∫(-5cos(5t)/jω)e^(-jωt) dt\n\nAgain, apply integration by parts to the second integral. Let u = cos(5t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = -5sin(5t) dt and v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt).\n\nuv - ∫v du = (-cos(5t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt) - ∫(5sin(5t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNow, we have:\n\n∫[sin(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = (-sin(5t)/jω)e^(-jωt) - (-cos(5t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt) - ∫(5sin(5t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNotice that the remaining integral is the same as the original integral, but multiplied by a factor of 5/ω^2. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(1 - 5/ω^2) * ∫[sin(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = (-sin(5t)/jω)e^(-jωt) - (-cos(5t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, solve for the original integral:\n\n∫[sin(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = [(-sin(5t)/jω)e^(-jωt) - (-cos(5t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt)] / (1 - 5/ω^2)\n\nNow, let's solve the second integral:\n\n∫[cos(10t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = cos(10t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = -10sin(10t) dt and v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt).\n\nNow, apply integration by parts:\n\nuv - ∫v du = (-cos(10t)/jω)e^(-jωt) - ∫(10sin(10t)/jω)e^(-jωt) dt\n\nAgain, apply integration by parts to the second integral. Let u = sin(10t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 10cos(10t) dt and v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt).\n\nuv - ∫v du = (sin(10t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt) - ∫(-10cos(10t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNow, we have:\n\n∫[cos(10t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = (-cos(10t)/jω)e^(-jωt) + (sin(10t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt) - ∫(-10cos(10t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNotice that the remaining integral is the same as the original integral, but multiplied by a factor of -10/ω^2. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(1 + 10/ω^2) * ∫[cos(10t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = (-cos(10t)/jω)e^(-jωt) + (sin(10t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, solve for the original integral:\n\n∫[cos(10t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = [(-cos(10t)/jω)e^(-jωt) + (sin(10t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt)] / (1 + 10/ω^2)\n\nFinally, we can write the Fourier transform of the given signal as:\n\nF(ω) = [(-sin(5t)/jω)e^(-jωt) - (-cos(5t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt)] / (1 - 5/ω^2) + [(-cos(10t)/jω)e^(-jωt) + (sin(10t)/ω^2)e^(-jωt)] / (1 + 10/ω^2)\n\nThis expression represents the frequency spectrum of the signal f(t) = sin(5t) + cos(10t) for all values of t ranging from 0 to 2π."
