    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 30, the dihedral group of order 2×15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 30, which has prime factorization 2 × 3 × 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nFor p = 2, the possible number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 1 or 15.\nFor p = 3, the possible number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1 or 10.\nFor p = 5, the possible number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 30:\nA group of order 30 is cyclic if and only if it has a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime factor p. In this case, G would have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. The intersection of these subgroups would be the identity element, and their product would generate the entire group G. If G has this property, then it is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 30.\n\n2. Dihedral group of order 2×15:\nThe dihedral group of order 2×15 has a cyclic subgroup of order 15 and an element of order 2 that is not in this cyclic subgroup. The cyclic subgroup of order 15 has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. If G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup but has 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 2×15.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 30:\nIf G is a non-abelian group of order 30, it cannot have a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime factor p, as that would make it cyclic. It also cannot have the same Sylow subgroup structure as the dihedral group of order 2×15. One possibility is that G has 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. In this case, G would be a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nTo determine which of these cases applies to G, we would need more information about the group's structure and properties. Without further information, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 30, the dihedral group of order 2×15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
