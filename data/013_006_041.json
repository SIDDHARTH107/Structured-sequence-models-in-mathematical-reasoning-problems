    "message_1": "A group of three hunters are trying to catch either a stag or a hare. However, catching a stag requires coordination between all three hunters, while it is possible for one hunter to catch a hare alone. \n\nThe payoff table for the Stag Hunt game is as follows:\n- If all three hunters coordinate to catch the stag, they each receive 10 units of reward.\n- If one hunter breaks from the group and catches a hare on their own, they receive 8 units of reward, but the other two hunters receive nothing.\n- If all three hunters try to catch the stag, but fail because of miscoordination, they receive nothing.\n\nWhat is the Nash Equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "In this game, there are two Nash Equilibria:\n\n1. All three hunters coordinate to catch the stag (Stag, Stag, Stag). In this case, each hunter receives 10 units of reward. If any one of them deviates and tries to catch a hare, their reward will decrease to 8 units, while the other two hunters will receive nothing. Therefore, no hunter has an incentive to deviate from this strategy.\n\n2. One hunter catches a hare while the other two try to catch the stag (Hare, Stag, Stag). In this case, the hunter who catches the hare receives 8 units of reward, while the other two hunters receive nothing. If any of the hunters who are trying to catch the stag deviate and try to catch a hare as well, their reward will still be zero, so they have no incentive to deviate. The hunter who catches the hare also has no incentive to switch to trying to catch the stag, as they would need the other two hunters to coordinate with them, which is not guaranteed.\n\nThus, the Nash Equilibria of this game are (Stag, Stag, Stag) and (Hare, Stag, Stag) or any other combination where one hunter catches a hare and the other two try to catch the stag."
