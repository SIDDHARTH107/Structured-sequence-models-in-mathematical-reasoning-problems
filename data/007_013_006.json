    "message_2": "Goldbach's conjecture is an unsolved problem in number theory that states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Although it has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large numbers and found to be true, a general proof or disproof has not been found yet.\n\nHowever, we can still find two prime numbers that add up to a specific even integer, such as 100, using a simple algorithm:\n\n1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n2. Subtract the current prime number from the even integer (100 - 2 = 98).\n3. Check if the result is a prime number. If it is, then we have found the two prime numbers that add up to the even integer. If not, move on to the next smallest prime number and repeat steps 2 and 3.\n\nFollowing this algorithm:\n\n1. Start with 2.\n2. Subtract 2 from 100: 100 - 2 = 98.\n3. Check if 98 is prime. It is not (it is divisible by 2), so move on to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.\n\n1. Now we have 3.\n2. Subtract 3 from 100: 100 - 3 = 97.\n3. Check if 97 is prime. It is (it has no divisors other than 1 and itself).\n\nSo, the two prime numbers that add up to 100 are 3 and 97: 3 + 97 = 100."
