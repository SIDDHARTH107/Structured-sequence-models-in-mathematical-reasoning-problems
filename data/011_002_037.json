    "message_2": "The binomial coefficient, often denoted as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\", is calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the value of C(9, 5):\n\nC(9, 5) = 9! / (5! * (9-5)!)\n\nC(9, 5) = 9! / (5! * 4!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n9! = 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 362,880\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nNow, substitute the factorials back into the formula:\n\nC(9, 5) = 362,880 / (120 * 24)\n\nC(9, 5) = 362,880 / 2,880\n\nC(9, 5) = 126\n\nSo, the value of the binomial coefficient (9 choose 5) is 126."
