    "message_1": "A used car dealership has 10 cars for sale. Each car is worth either $5,000 or $10,000 with equal probability. The dealership has perfect information about the true values of each car but the buyer does not. The buyer believes that each car is worth $7,500. What is the expected value of the dealership's profit if it charges $8,000 for each car?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the dealership's profit, we need to consider the profit for each car based on its true value and the probability of each value.\n\nFor a car worth $5,000, the dealership will make a profit of $8,000 - $5,000 = $3,000.\nFor a car worth $10,000, the dealership will make a loss of $8,000 - $10,000 = -$2,000.\n\nSince each car has an equal probability of being worth $5,000 or $10,000, the expected profit for each car is:\n\n(0.5 * $3,000) + (0.5 * -$2,000) = $1,500 - $1,000 = $500\n\nSince there are 10 cars for sale, the expected value of the dealership's total profit is:\n\n10 * $500 = $5,000."
