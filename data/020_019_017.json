Assume the rocket's fuel consumption rate is proportional to the acceleration.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the fuel consumption, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, which is an optimization method for solving optimal control problems. The Hamiltonian function for this problem is given by:\n\nH(y1, y2, u, p1, p2) = p1*y2 + p2*(-0.01y2 - 0.0001y1 + u) + λu^2\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the costate variables, and λ is a positive constant representing the weight of the fuel consumption in the optimization problem.\n\nThe necessary conditions for optimality are given by the following system of equations:\n\n1. dy1/dt = ∂H/∂p1 = y2\n2. dy2/dt = ∂H/∂p2 = -0.01y2 - 0.0001y1 + u\n3. dp1/dt = -∂H/∂y1 = 0.0001*p2\n4. dp2/dt = -∂H/∂y2 = 0.01*p2 - p1\n5. ∂H/∂u = 0 => p2 + 2λu = 0 => u = -p2/(2λ)\n\nNow we have a system of five differential equations. To solve this system, we need to specify the initial conditions for y1, y2, and the final conditions for p1 and p2. The initial conditions are given by:\n\ny1(0) = 1.5 AU\ny2(0) = 35 km/s\n\nThe final conditions for p1 and p2 can be found by solving the transversality conditions:\n\np1(T) = 0\np2(T) = 0\n\nwhere T is the time when the rocket reaches Mars.\n\nTo find the optimal acceleration function u(t), we need to solve this system of differential equations with the given initial and final conditions. This can be done numerically using various software tools like MATLAB or Python.\n\nOnce the numerical solution is obtained, the optimal acceleration function u(t) can be found as:\n\nu(t) = -p2(t)/(2λ)"
