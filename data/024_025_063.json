    "message_2": "To determine the Chern classes of X, we need to compute the second and third Chern classes, c_2(X) and c_3(X), in addition to the given first Chern class c_1(X) = 4H + 2E.\n\nThe Chern classes of X are related to the Chern classes of the tangent bundle TX. By the Chern-Weil theory, we have the following relations:\n\nc(TX) = 1 + c_1(TX) + c_2(TX) + c_3(TX)\n\nwhere c(TX) is the total Chern class of the tangent bundle TX.\n\nFor a complex manifold of complex dimension 3, the tangent bundle TX has rank 3. Therefore, we can use the splitting principle to write the total Chern class of TX as a product of Chern classes of line bundles:\n\nc(TX) = (1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)(1 + x_3)\n\nwhere x_1, x_2, and x_3 are the first Chern classes of line bundles associated with TX.\n\nExpanding the product, we get:\n\nc(TX) = 1 + (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) + (x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3) + x_1x_2x_3\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\nc_1(TX) = x_1 + x_2 + x_3\nc_2(TX) = x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3\nc_3(TX) = x_1x_2x_3\n\nNow, we know that c_1(TX) = c_1(X) = 4H + 2E. To compute c_2(X) and c_3(X), we need more information about the manifold X and its tangent bundle TX. In general, these Chern classes can be expressed in terms of intersection numbers of divisors and characteristic classes of the manifold.\n\nHowever, without further information about the manifold X, its tangent bundle TX, or the relations between the divisors H and E, it is not possible to explicitly compute c_2(X) and c_3(X)."
