    "message_2": "To partition a set of 6 elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell numbers. The Bell number B(n) counts the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets. \n\nFor a set of 6 elements, we are looking for the 6th Bell number (not the 5th, as mentioned in the note). The first few Bell numbers are:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo, the 6th Bell number is:\n\nB(6) = 203\n\nTherefore, there are 203 ways to partition a set of 6 elements into non-empty subsets."
