    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x over the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = (1 / (2 * π)) * [x^2 / 2] | (-π, π) = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(n * x) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function and cos(n * x) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = sin(n * x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-1 / n) * cos(n * x).\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-x / n) * cos(n * x) | (-π, π) + (1 / n) * ∫[-π, π] cos(n * x) dx]\n\nThe second term in the brackets is zero since the integral of cos(n * x) over the interval [-π, π] is zero. Therefore, we have:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-π / n) * cos(n * π) - (-π / n) * cos(-n * π)]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-π / n) * (-1)^n - (-π / n) * (-1)^(-n)]\n\nb_n = (2 * π / n) * (-1)^n for odd n, and 0 for even n.\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series for f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(n * x)] = Σ [(2 * π / n) * (-1)^n * sin(n * x)] for odd n\n\nNow, let's solve the partial differential equation (PDE) ∂u/∂t = k∂^2u/∂x^2 with the initial condition u(x, 0) = f(x) and the boundary conditions u(-π, t) = u(π, t) = 0 for all t.\n\nSince the PDE is linear, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x) * T(t). Then, the PDE becomes:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = k * X''(x) * T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by k * X(x) * T(t), we get:\n\n(T'(t) / (k * T(t))) = (X''(x) / X(x))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ. Then, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\nT'(t) = -k * λ * T(t)\nX''(x) = -λ * X(x)\n\nThe boundary conditions for X(x) are X(-π) = X(π) = 0. This is a Sturm-Liouville problem, and the eigenvalues λ and eigenfunctions X(x) are given by:\n\nλ_n = n^2, X_n(x) = sin(n * x) for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, let's solve the ODE for T(t):\n\nT'(t) = -k * λ_n * T(t)\n\nT_n(t) = Ce^(-k * n^2 * t) for some constant C.\n\nNow, we can write the solution to the PDE as a sum of the product of the eigenfunctions X_n(x) and T_n(t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [X_n(x) * T_n(t)] = Σ [sin(n * x) * Ce^(-k * n^2 * t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [sin(n * x) * C]\n\nComparing this with the Fourier series for f(x), we find that C = (2 * π / n) * (-1)^n for odd n, and 0 for even n.\n\nFinally, the solution to the PDE is:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(2 * π / n) * (-1)^n * sin(n * x) * e^(-k * n^2 * t)] for odd n\n\nThis is the solution for u(x, t) for all values of x and t, subject to the given initial and boundary conditions."
