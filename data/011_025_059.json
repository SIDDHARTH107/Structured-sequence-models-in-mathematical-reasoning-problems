    "message_2": "In this combinatorial game, the optimal strategy for both players is to ensure that they leave an even number of stones for their opponent after each move. This way, they can guarantee that they will always have a move to make, while their opponent will eventually run out of moves.\n\nLet's analyze the game step by step:\n\n1. Player 1 starts with six stones and can take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 stones from the pile. To leave an even number of stones for Player 2, Player 1 should take either 1, 3, or 5 stones.\n\n2. Player 2 also has six stones and can take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 stones from the pile. To leave an even number of stones for Player 1, Player 2 should also take either 1, 3, or 5 stones.\n\nThis pattern continues until one player is unable to make a move. Since both players start with an even number of stones and always leave an even number of stones for their opponent, the game will continue until the pile is empty.\n\nIn the end, the player who cannot make a move loses. Since there are 12 stones in total and both players are taking an odd number of stones in each turn, the game will end when one player has taken all the stones, leaving none for their opponent.\n\nIf both players play optimally, the outcome of the game will be a draw, as both players will have taken six stones each, and neither player will be able to make a move."
