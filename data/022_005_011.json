    "message_2": "To calculate the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z = -i, we first need to find the order of the pole. The denominator of the function is:\n\nD(z) = z^4 + 2z^2 + 1\n\nWe can factor D(z) as follows:\n\nD(z) = (z^2 + 1)^2\n\nNow, we can see that D(-i) = (-i^2 + 1)^2 = (0)^2 = 0, so z = -i is indeed a pole. Since the exponent of (z^2 + 1) is 2, the order of the pole is 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the residue of f(z) at z = -i. To do this, we will use the formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order n:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = (1/(n-1)!) * (d^(n-1)/dz^(n-1))[(z - (-i))^n * f(z)]|_(z=-i)\n\nIn our case, n = 2, so the formula becomes:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = (1/(1)!) * (d/dz)[(z + i)^2 * f(z)]|_(z=-i)\n\nNow, we need to compute the derivative and evaluate it at z = -i:\n\nd/dz[(z + i)^2 * f(z)] = d/dz[(z + i)^2 * (4z^3 + 3z - 1)/(z^4 + 2z^2 + 1)]\n\nTo compute the derivative, we can use the quotient rule:\n\nd/dz[u/v] = (v * du/dz - u * dv/dz) / v^2\n\nLet u = (z + i)^2 * (4z^3 + 3z - 1) and v = (z^4 + 2z^2 + 1). Then, we have:\n\ndu/dz = d/dz[(z + i)^2 * (4z^3 + 3z - 1)] = 2(z + i)(4z^3 + 3z - 1) + (z + i)^2 * (12z^2 + 3)\ndv/dz = d/dz[z^4 + 2z^2 + 1] = 4z^3 + 4z\n\nNow, we can compute the derivative of f(z):\n\nd/dz[f(z)] = ((z^4 + 2z^2 + 1) * (2(z + i)(4z^3 + 3z - 1) + (z + i)^2 * (12z^2 + 3)) - (z + i)^2 * (4z^3 + 3z - 1) * (4z^3 + 4z)) / (z^4 + 2z^2 + 1)^2\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate this expression at z = -i:\n\nd/dz[f(z)]|_(z=-i) = ((1) * (2(-i)(4(-i)^3 + 3(-i) - 1) + (-i + i)^2 * (12(-i)^2 + 3)) - (-i + i)^2 * (4(-i)^3 + 3(-i) - 1) * (4(-i)^3 + 4(-i))) / (1)^2\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nd/dz[f(z)]|_(z=-i) = (2(-i)(4 + 3(-i) - 1)) = -2i(3 - 3i)\n\nNow, we can compute the residue:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = (1/1!) * (-2i(3 - 3i)) = -2i(3 - 3i)\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z = -i is -2i(3 - 3i)."
