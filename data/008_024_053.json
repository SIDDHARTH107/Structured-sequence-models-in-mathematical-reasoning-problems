    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. We can divide the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x and y the same in both equations:\n\nx + y = 4\nx + y = 4 (after dividing the second equation by 2)\n\nNow we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:\n\n(x + y) - (x + y) = 4 - 4\n0 = 0\n\nSince we got 0 = 0, it means that these two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions for this system of equations, and they are all the points on the line x + y = 4. To express the solutions in terms of x and y, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ny = 4 - x\n\nSo for any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y that satisfies the system of equations."
