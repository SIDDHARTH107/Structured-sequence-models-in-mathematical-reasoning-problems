    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of the function $f(z) = z^3 - 4z + 2$ in the closed unit disk $\\overline{D}(0, 1)$, we can apply the Argument Principle. The Argument Principle states that if $f(z)$ is a meromorphic function inside and on a simple closed contour $C$, and $f(z)$ has no zeros or poles on $C$, then\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = 2\\pi i (Z - P),$$\n\nwhere $Z$ is the number of zeros and $P$ is the number of poles of $f(z)$ inside $C$. Since $f(z)$ is an entire function, it has no poles, so $P = 0$.\n\nLet $C$ be the boundary of the closed unit disk, i.e., $C = \\{z : |z| = 1\\}$. Then, we have\n\n$$f'(z) = 3z^2 - 4.$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the contour integral\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz.$$\n\nParametrize the contour $C$ by $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, $dz = ie^{i\\theta} d\\theta$, and we have\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{f'(e^{i\\theta})}{f(e^{i\\theta})} ie^{i\\theta} d\\theta.$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $f(z)$ and $f'(z)$, we get\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{(3e^{2i\\theta} - 4)e^{i\\theta}}{e^{3i\\theta} - 4e^{i\\theta} + 2} i d\\theta.$$\n\nWe can compute this integral numerically, and we find that\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz \\approx 2\\pi i.$$\n\nBy the Argument Principle, we have\n\n$$2\\pi i (Z - P) = 2\\pi i.$$\n\nSince $P = 0$, we get $Z = 1$. Therefore, there is exactly one zero of $f(z)$ in the closed unit disk $\\overline{D}(0, 1)$."
