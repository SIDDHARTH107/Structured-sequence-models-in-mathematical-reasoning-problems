The can has no top, and the material used to make the can costs $0.04 per square centimeter. What is the dimensions (radius and height) of the cylindrical can that minimize the cost of materials?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of materials, we need to minimize the surface area of the cylindrical can. The volume of a cylinder is given by V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since we know the volume is 250 cubic centimeters, we have:\n\n250 = πr^2h\n\nWe need to express h in terms of r, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nh = 250 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, let's find the surface area of the cylinder without the top. The surface area of the side is given by A_side = 2πrh, and the surface area of the bottom is given by A_bottom = πr^2. So, the total surface area A is:\n\nA = A_side + A_bottom = 2πrh + πr^2\n\nSubstitute h from the previous equation:\n\nA = 2πr(250 / (πr^2)) + πr^2\nA = 500/r + πr^2\n\nNow, we need to minimize A with respect to r. To do this, we'll find the derivative of A with respect to r and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = -500/r^2 + 2πr\n\nNow, set dA/dr = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = -500/r^2 + 2πr\n500/r^2 = 2πr\n500 = 2πr^3\nr^3 = 500 / (2π)\nr^3 ≈ 79.577\nr ≈ 4.326 cm\n\nNow, we can find the height using the equation for h:\n\nh = 250 / (π(4.326)^2)\nh ≈ 4.326 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions that minimize the cost of materials are a radius of approximately 4.326 cm and a height of approximately 4.326 cm."
