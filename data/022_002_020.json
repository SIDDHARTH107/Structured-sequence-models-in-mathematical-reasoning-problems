    "message_2": "(a) The unit circle $|z| = 1$\n\nFor this circle, we have $|z| = 1$. We want to find the image under $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. Let $w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. Then, $z = \\frac{1}{w}$. We can substitute this into the equation for the unit circle:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{1}{w}\\right| = 1$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $|w|$ gives:\n\n$$|1| = |w|$$\n\nSo, the image of the unit circle under $f$ is the circle with radius 1 centered at the origin, which is the same as the original circle.\n\n(b) The circle $|z-2i| = 1$\n\nFor this circle, we have $|z-2i| = 1$. We want to find the image under $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. Let $w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. Then, $z = \\frac{1}{w}$. We can substitute this into the equation for the circle:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{1}{w}-2i\\right| = 1$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $|w|$ gives:\n\n$$\\left|1-2iw\\right| = |w|$$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$$(1-2iw)(1+2i\\bar{w}) = w\\bar{w}$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we have:\n\n$$1 + 4i^2|w|^2 - 2i(w - \\bar{w}) = |w|^2$$\n\nSince $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to:\n\n$$1 - 4|w|^2 + 2i(w - \\bar{w}) = |w|^2$$\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations:\n\n$$1 - 4|w|^2 = |w|^2 \\Rightarrow |w|^2 = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\n$$2i(w - \\bar{w}) = 0 \\Rightarrow w = \\bar{w}$$\n\nSince $w = \\bar{w}$, $w$ must be real. Thus, the image of the circle $|z-2i| = 1$ under $f$ is the circle with radius $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ centered at the origin on the real axis.\n\n(c) The circle $|z+1| = 2$\n\nFor this circle, we have $|z+1| = 2$. We want to find the image under $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. Let $w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. Then, $z = \\frac{1}{w}$. We can substitute this into the equation for the circle:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{1}{w}+1\\right| = 2$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $|w|$ gives:\n\n$$|1+w| = 2|w|$$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$$(1+w)(1+\\bar{w}) = 4w\\bar{w}$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we have:\n\n$$1 + w + \\bar{w} + w\\bar{w} = 4w\\bar{w}$$\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n$$w\\bar{w} - w - \\bar{w} + 1 = 0$$\n\nLet $w = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then, we have:\n\n$$(x^2 + y^2) - (x + yi) - (x - yi) + 1 = 0$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 - 2xi + 1 = 0$$\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 = -1$$\n\n$$-2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$$\n\nSince $x^2 + y^2 = -1$ has no solutions for real $x$ and $y$, there is no image of the circle $|z+1| = 2$ under $f$. This is because the circle $|z+1| = 2$ does not intersect the unit disk $D(0,1)$, so it is not in the domain of $f$."
