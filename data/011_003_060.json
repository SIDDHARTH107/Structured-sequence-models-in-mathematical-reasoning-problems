    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is derived from Pascal's Triangle. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, we want to choose 4 different numbers from the first 10 positive integers, so n = 10 and k = 4.\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1)(6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo there are 210 ways to choose 4 different numbers from the first 10 positive integers using Pascal's Triangle."
