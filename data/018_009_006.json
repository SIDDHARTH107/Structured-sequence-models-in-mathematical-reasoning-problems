    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and the Cartesian product of B and C.\n\nA = {1, 2}\nB = {3, 4}\nC = {5, 6}\n\nThe Cartesian product of B and C is:\n\nB × C = {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and (B × C):\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (3, 6)), (1, (4, 5)), (1, (4, 6)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (3, 6)), (2, (4, 5)), (2, (4, 6))}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then the Cartesian product of the result with set C.\n\nThe Cartesian product of A and B is:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A × B) and C:\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 3), 6), ((1, 4), 5), ((1, 4), 6), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 3), 6), ((2, 4), 5), ((2, 4), 6)}\n\nNow, we need to prove that both results are equal. To do this, we can rewrite the elements of (A × B) × C in the same format as the elements of A × (B × C):\n\n{((1, 3), 5) → (1, (3, 5)), ((1, 3), 6) → (1, (3, 6)), ((1, 4), 5) → (1, (4, 5)), ((1, 4), 6) → (1, (4, 6)), ((2, 3), 5) → (2, (3, 5)), ((2, 3), 6) → (2, (3, 6)), ((2, 4), 5) → (2, (4, 5)), ((2, 4), 6) → (2, (4, 6))}\n\nNow, both sets look like this:\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (3, 6)), (1, (4, 5)), (1, (4, 6)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (3, 6)), (2, (4, 5)), (2, (4, 6))}\n(A × B) × C = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (3, 6)), (1, (4, 5)), (1, (4, 6)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (3, 6)), (2, (4, 5)), (2, (4, 6))}\n\nAs we can see, both sets are equal:\n\nA × (B × C) = (A × B) × C"
