    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 280 are married and 220 have at least one child. If 180 people are married and have at least one child, what is the probability that a randomly selected person from the community is married or has at least one child?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected person is married or has at least one child, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of being married, B is the event of having at least one child, and A ∩ B is the event of being both married and having at least one child.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- There are 280 married people (A) out of 500.\n- There are 220 people with at least one child (B) out of 500.\n- There are 180 people who are married and have at least one child (A ∩ B) out of 500.\n\nNow we can find the probabilities of each event:\n\nP(A) = 280/500\nP(B) = 220/500\nP(A ∩ B) = 180/500\n\nNow we can use the formula:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\nP(A ∪ B) = (280/500) + (220/500) - (180/500)\nP(A ∪ B) = 320/500\n\nSo the probability that a randomly selected person from the community is married or has at least one child is 320/500, which can be simplified to 16/25 or 0.64 (64%)."
