    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a message \"MEET ME AFTER THE PARTY\" encrypted using a transposition cipher. The ciphertext obtained is \"EMTME EERA HTEPTY FAER\". Determine the number of columns used in the transposition cipher.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of columns used in the transposition cipher, we can compare the original message and the ciphertext. The original message has 24 characters (including spaces), and the ciphertext has the same number of characters.\n\nOriginal message: MEET ME AFTER THE PARTY\nCiphertext:      EMTME EERA HTEPTY FAER\n\nNotice that the first and second characters of the original message are swapped in the ciphertext (M -> E, E -> M). This pattern continues throughout the message. This suggests that the transposition cipher is using a columnar transposition with 2 columns.\n\nSo, the number of columns used in the transposition cipher is 2."
