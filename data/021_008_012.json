    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix, which consists of the partial derivatives of the functions with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x + y and g(x, y) = y^3 - 3y + x. Then the Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y |\n          | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3\n∂f/∂y = 1\n∂g/∂x = 1\n∂g/∂y = 3y^2 - 3\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 3x^2 - 3   1    |\n          |    1     3y^2 - 3 |\n\nNow we apply Newton's method using the initial approximation (1.5, 2.5). The iterative formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x, y) = (x, y) - J(x, y)^(-1) * F(x, y)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the vector of the functions [f(x, y), g(x, y)] and J(x, y)^(-1) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix.\n\nWe will iterate this process until the solution converges to 4 decimal places.\n\n1st iteration:\nInitial approximation: (1.5, 2.5)\nJ(1.5, 2.5) = | 3(1.5)^2 - 3   1    | = |  3.75   1  |\n              |    1     3(2.5)^2 - 3 |   |  1    15.75 |\n\nNow we need to find the inverse of J(1.5, 2.5):\n\nJ(1.5, 2.5)^(-1) = 1/(3.75*15.75 - 1) * |  15.75  -1  |\n                                       |  -1      3.75 |\n\nJ(1.5, 2.5)^(-1) = 1/58.5 * |  15.75  -1  |\n                           |  -1      3.75 |\n\nNow we compute F(1.5, 2.5) = [f(1.5, 2.5), g(1.5, 2.5)] = [-0.875, 9.625]\n\nNext, we compute the product J(1.5, 2.5)^(-1) * F(1.5, 2.5):\n\nJ(1.5, 2.5)^(-1) * F(1.5, 2.5) = 1/58.5 * |  15.75  -1  | * |-0.875|\n                                                |  -1      3.75 |   | 9.625|\n\nJ(1.5, 2.5)^(-1) * F(1.5, 2.5) = 1/58.5 * | -12.65625 |\n                                                |   3.65625 |\n\nNow we update our approximation:\n\n(1.5, 2.5) - J(1.5, 2.5)^(-1) * F(1.5, 2.5) = (1.5, 2.5) - 1/58.5 * (-12.65625, 3.65625) = (1.716, 2.437)\n\n2nd iteration:\nApproximation: (1.716, 2.437)\nRepeating the process above, we get the new approximation: (1.7237, 2.4149)\n\n3rd iteration:\nApproximation: (1.7237, 2.4149)\nRepeating the process above, we get the new approximation: (1.7238, 2.4147)\n\nSince the solution has converged to 4 decimal places, the final solution is (1.7238, 2.4147)."
