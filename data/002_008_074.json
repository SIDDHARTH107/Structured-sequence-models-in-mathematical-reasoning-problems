    "message_2": "The formula to find the volume of a cone is V = (1/3)πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (1/3)π(7)²(10)\nV = (1/3)π(49)(10)\nV = (1/3)π(490)\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume:\n\nV ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(490)\nV ≈ 513.665\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the volume of the cone is approximately 513.67 cubic centimeters."
