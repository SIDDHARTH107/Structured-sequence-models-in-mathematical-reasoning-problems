    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x, we need to find the points where the second derivative changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x where f''(x) = 0:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nNow, we need to check if the second derivative changes its sign at x = 2. We can do this by testing the values of f''(x) for x-values slightly less than and greater than 2:\n\nf''(1.9) = 6(1.9) - 12 = -0.4 (negative)\nf''(2.1) = 6(2.1) - 12 = 0.6 (positive)\n\nSince the second derivative changes its sign at x = 2, there is an inflection point at x = 2. To find the corresponding y-value, we plug x = 2 back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) = 8 - 24 + 18 = 2\n\nSo, the inflection point is at (2, 2)."
