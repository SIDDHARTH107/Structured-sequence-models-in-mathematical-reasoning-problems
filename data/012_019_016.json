    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph G, denoted by Δ(G). Since G has 7 vertices and 10 edges, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 10) / 7 ≈ 2.86. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 3.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: Δ(G) = 3\nIf the maximum degree is 3, then by Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) is either Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1, i.e., 3 or 4. We know that a graph with maximum degree 3 can have at most 3 * 7 / 2 = 10.5 edges. Since G has 10 edges, it is possible for G to have a maximum degree of 3. In this case, we cannot rule out the possibility of χ'(G) being 3 or 4.\n\nCase 2: Δ(G) ≥ 4\nIf the maximum degree is at least 4, then by Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) is either Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1, i.e., at least 4. However, a graph with maximum degree 4 can have at most 4 * 7 / 2 = 14 edges, which is more than the number of edges in G. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nSince Case 1 is the only possible case, the chromatic index χ'(G) is either 3 or 4. To determine the exact value, we would need more information about the specific structure of the graph G."
