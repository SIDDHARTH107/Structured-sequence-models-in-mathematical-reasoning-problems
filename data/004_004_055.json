    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve between the x-values of 0 and 4, we need to integrate the function y = x^2 + 3x - 4 with respect to x from 0 to 4.\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 3x - 4) dx from 0 to 4\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative of x^2 is (1/3)x^3\nAntiderivative of 3x is (3/2)x^2\nAntiderivative of -4 is -4x\n\nSo, the antiderivative of the function is (1/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - 4x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\n[(1/3)(4)^3 + (3/2)(4)^2 - 4(4)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + (3/2)(0)^2 - 4(0)]\n\n= [(1/3)(64) + (3/2)(16) - 16] - [0]\n\n= [21.333 + 24 - 16]\n\n= 29.333\n\nSo, the area under the curve between the x-values of 0 and 4 is approximately 29.333 square units."
