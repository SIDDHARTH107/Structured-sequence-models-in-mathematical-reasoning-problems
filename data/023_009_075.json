    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to rewrite the problem in terms of a Fourier series. Since the given boundary conditions are not homogeneous, we will first find a particular solution and then solve the homogeneous problem.\n\nLet's find a particular solution $y_p(x)$ that satisfies the boundary conditions:\n\n$$\ny_p(0) = 0, \\quad y_p(\\pi) = 1.\n$$\n\nA simple choice for $y_p(x)$ is a linear function:\n\n$$\ny_p(x) = \\frac{x}{\\pi}.\n$$\n\nNow, let's consider the homogeneous problem:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 y_h}{dx^2} + 4y_h = 0, \\quad y_h(0) = 0, \\quad y_h(\\pi) = 0.\n$$\n\nThe general solution to the homogeneous problem is:\n\n$$\ny_h(x) = A\\sin(2x) + B\\cos(2x).\n$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n$$\ny_h(0) = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = B = 0,\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\ny_h(\\pi) = A\\sin(2\\pi) = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $A\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$ for any value of $A$, we can write the homogeneous solution as:\n\n$$\ny_h(x) = A\\sin(2x).\n$$\n\nNow, the general solution to the original problem is the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions:\n\n$$\ny(x) = y_p(x) + y_h(x) = \\frac{x}{\\pi} + A\\sin(2x).\n$$\n\nHowever, we have already satisfied the boundary conditions with the particular solution, so we don't need to find the value of $A$. Thus, the solution to the given boundary value problem is:\n\n$$\ny(x) = \\frac{x}{\\pi} + A\\sin(2x).\n$$"
