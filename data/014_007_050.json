    "message_1": "Suppose a stream cipher generated a random key stream of length 10 that consists of the numbers {0, 1, 2, 3} with equal probability. Find the probability that the key stream contains three consecutive numbers in ascending order.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the total number of possible key streams and then find the number of key streams that contain three consecutive numbers in ascending order. Finally, we will divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes to find the probability.\n\nThere are 4 numbers in the set {0, 1, 2, 3}, and each number can appear in any of the 10 positions in the key stream. Therefore, there are 4^10 possible key streams.\n\nNow, let's find the number of key streams that contain three consecutive numbers in ascending order. We can have the following consecutive triplets: (0, 1, 2) or (1, 2, 3). We will consider each case separately and then combine the results.\n\nCase 1: (0, 1, 2)\nWe can place this triplet in any of the 8 positions in the key stream (1-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-6, 5-7, 6-8, 7-9, 8-10). For each position, there are 4^7 possible combinations for the remaining 7 positions. So, there are 8 * 4^7 key streams with the triplet (0, 1, 2).\n\nCase 2: (1, 2, 3)\nSimilar to case 1, we can place this triplet in any of the 8 positions in the key stream. For each position, there are 4^7 possible combinations for the remaining 7 positions. So, there are 8 * 4^7 key streams with the triplet (1, 2, 3).\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the key streams that contain both triplets (0, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 3). We need to subtract these from our total.\n\nCase 3: Both (0, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 3)\nThere are 6 positions where both triplets can appear in the key stream (1-5, 2-6, 3-7, 4-8, 5-9, 6-10). For each position, there are 4^4 possible combinations for the remaining 4 positions. So, there are 6 * 4^4 key streams with both triplets.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of key streams with either triplet (0, 1, 2) or triplet (1, 2, 3) by adding the results from cases 1 and 2 and subtracting the result from case 3:\n\nTotal key streams with consecutive triplets = (8 * 4^7) + (8 * 4^7) - (6 * 4^4)\n\nThe probability of having a key stream with three consecutive numbers in ascending order is:\n\nP(consecutive triplets) = (Total key streams with consecutive triplets) / (Total possible key streams)\nP(consecutive triplets) = ((8 * 4^7) + (8 * 4^7) - (6 * 4^4)) / (4^10)\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(consecutive triplets) = (32768 + 32768 - 6144) / 1048576\nP(consecutive triplets) = 59392 / 1048576\nP(consecutive triplets) â‰ˆ 0.0566\n\nSo, the probability that the key stream contains three consecutive numbers in ascending order is approximately 0.0566 or 5.66%."
