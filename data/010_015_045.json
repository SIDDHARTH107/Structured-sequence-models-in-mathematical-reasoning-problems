    "message_2": "To find the necessary and sufficient condition on $k$ and $\\omega$ for the cohomology class of $\\omega$ to be zero in $H_{d-k}(M)$, we need to recall the definition of De Rham cohomology and the Poincaré duality.\n\nRecall that the De Rham cohomology groups $H^k(M)$ are defined as the quotient of the space of closed $k$-forms (i.e., forms $\\omega$ such that $d\\omega = 0$) by the space of exact $k$-forms (i.e., forms $\\omega$ such that $\\omega = d\\eta$ for some $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$). In other words, $H^k(M) = \\ker d^k / \\operatorname{im} d^{k-1}$.\n\nPoincaré duality states that there is an isomorphism between the $k$-th and $(d-k)$-th De Rham cohomology groups of a smooth oriented manifold $M$ of dimension $d$. Specifically, this isomorphism is given by the integration of the wedge product of forms over the fundamental class of $M$. That is, for any closed $k$-form $\\omega$ and closed $(d-k)$-form $\\eta$, we have:\n\n$$\\int_M \\omega \\wedge \\eta = \\langle [\\omega], [\\eta] \\rangle,$$\n\nwhere $[\\omega]$ and $[\\eta]$ denote the cohomology classes of $\\omega$ and $\\eta$, respectively, and $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the pairing between cohomology classes.\n\nNow, we want to find the condition on $k$ and $\\omega$ for the cohomology class of $\\omega$ to be zero in $H_{d-k}(M)$. This means that we want $[\\omega] = 0$ in $H^k(M)$, which is equivalent to $\\omega$ being an exact form, i.e., $\\omega = d\\eta$ for some $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$.\n\nUsing the Poincaré duality, we can rephrase this condition as follows: for any closed $(d-k)$-form $\\eta$, we have\n\n$$\\int_M \\omega \\wedge \\eta = \\int_M d\\eta \\wedge \\eta = 0.$$\n\nBy the Stokes' theorem, we know that\n\n$$\\int_M d(\\eta \\wedge \\eta) = \\int_{\\partial M} \\eta \\wedge \\eta.$$\n\nSince $M$ is a closed manifold (i.e., it has no boundary), we have $\\partial M = \\emptyset$, and thus\n\n$$\\int_M d(\\eta \\wedge \\eta) = 0.$$\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition on $k$ and $\\omega$ for the cohomology class of $\\omega$ to be zero in $H_{d-k}(M)$ is that $\\omega$ is an exact form, i.e., $\\omega = d\\eta$ for some $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$."
