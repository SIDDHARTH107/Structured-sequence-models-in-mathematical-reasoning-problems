    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 6x² - 17x - 5, we can use the \"ac method\" which involves multiplying the leading coefficient (a) and the constant term (c), and then finding two numbers that multiply to ac and add up to the middle coefficient (b).\n\n1. Multiply the leading coefficient and the constant term: a * c = 6 * (-5) = -30\n2. Find two numbers that multiply to -30 and add up to -17: -20 and 3 (-20 * 3 = -30, -20 + 3 = -17)\n3. Rewrite the middle term using the two numbers found: 6x² - 20x + 3x - 5\n4. Factor by grouping: 2x(3x - 10) + 1(3x - 10)\n5. Factor out the common binomial: (3x - 10)(2x + 1)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 6x² - 17x - 5 is (3x - 10)(2x + 1)."
