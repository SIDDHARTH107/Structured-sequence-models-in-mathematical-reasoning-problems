    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix using the row reduction method, we need to perform a series of row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form. The rank of the matrix is the number of non-zero rows in the row-echelon form.\n\nGiven matrix:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 8 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract the first row from the third row:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Swap the second and third rows to move the non-zero row up:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. There are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of the matrix is 2."
