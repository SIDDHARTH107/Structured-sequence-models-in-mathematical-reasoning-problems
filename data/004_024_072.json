    "message_1": "Let's say we have the implicit function: \n\nx^2 + y^2 = 25 \n\nIf we wanted to find dy/dx, we would need to use the chain rule. \n\nFind dy/dx at the point (3, 4).",
    "message_2": "To find dy/dx, we first need to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, using the chain rule.\n\nDifferentiating x^2 with respect to x gives 2x.\nDifferentiating y^2 with respect to x gives 2y(dy/dx), since y is a function of x.\n\nSo, differentiating both sides of the equation x^2 + y^2 = 25 with respect to x, we get:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\ndy/dx = -2x / 2y\n\nAt the point (3, 4), we have:\n\ndy/dx = -2(3) / 2(4)\ndy/dx = -6 / 8\ndy/dx = -3/4\n\nSo, the derivative dy/dx at the point (3, 4) is -3/4."
