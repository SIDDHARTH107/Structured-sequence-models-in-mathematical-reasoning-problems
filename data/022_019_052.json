    "message_2": "To evaluate the contour integral, we will use the residue theorem. The residue theorem states that for a function with isolated singularities inside a simple closed contour, the integral of the function around the contour is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of the function at its singularities inside the contour.\n\nIn this case, the function is $f(z) = \\frac{\\sin(z)}{z-2}$, and it has a simple pole at $z = 2$. Since the contour $C$ is a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin, the pole at $z = 2$ is inside the contour.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue of the function at the pole. The residue of a function with a simple pole at $z = z_0$ can be found using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Res}(f, z_0) = \\lim_{z \\to z_0} (z - z_0) f(z)\n$$\n\nIn our case, $z_0 = 2$, so we have:\n\n$$\n\\text{Res}(f, 2) = \\lim_{z \\to 2} (z - 2) \\frac{\\sin(z)}{z-2}\n$$\n\nThe limit simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\text{Res}(f, 2) = \\lim_{z \\to 2} \\sin(z) = \\sin(2)\n$$\n\nNow, we can apply the residue theorem:\n\n$$\n\\int_C \\frac{\\sin(z)}{z-2} dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}(f, 2) = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\sin(2)\n$$\n\nSo, the value of the contour integral is:\n\n$$\n\\int_C \\frac{\\sin(z)}{z-2} dz = 2\\pi i \\sin(2)\n$$"
