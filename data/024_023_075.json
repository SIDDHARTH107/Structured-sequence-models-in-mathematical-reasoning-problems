    "message_2": "A symmetry of a manifold M is a transformation that preserves the structure of M, i.e., a transformation that maps M onto itself. For a sphere, these symmetries are rotations and reflections.\n\nThe sphere of radius 3 centered at the origin in R^3 has the same symmetries as any other sphere centered at the origin, so we can consider the unit sphere for simplicity. The symmetries of the unit sphere are given by the orthogonal group O(3), which consists of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 (rotations) or -1 (reflections).\n\nTo count the number of symmetries, we can consider the action of the symmetry group on the sphere. The sphere has rotational symmetry about any axis through the origin, and there are infinitely many such axes. For each axis, there are infinitely many rotations by different angles that preserve the sphere. Additionally, there are infinitely many planes of reflection symmetry that pass through the origin.\n\nSince there are infinitely many axes of rotation and planes of reflection, the number of symmetries of the sphere is infinite."
