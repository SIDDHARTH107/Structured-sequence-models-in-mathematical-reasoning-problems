    "message_2": "First, let's prove that if A is compact, then A is closed and bounded.\n\nProof:\n1. A is closed: To show that A is closed, we need to show that its complement, X\\A, is open. Let x be an element in X\\A. Since A is compact, for every open cover of A, there exists a finite subcover. Consider the open cover of A consisting of open sets U_a = {y ∈ X | d(y, a) < d(x, a)/2} for each a ∈ A, where d(y, a) denotes the distance between y and a. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover of A, say {U_a1, U_a2, ..., U_an}. Let V = X\\(U_a1 ∪ U_a2 ∪ ... ∪ U_an). V is open, and x ∈ V. Moreover, V ∩ A = ∅, since V is a subset of the complement of the finite subcover. Thus, X\\A is open, and A is closed.\n\n2. A is bounded: Since A is compact, for every open cover of A, there exists a finite subcover. Consider the open cover of A consisting of open balls B(a, 1) for each a ∈ A. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover of A, say {B(a1, 1), B(a2, 1), ..., B(an, 1)}. Let M = max{d(a1, a2), d(a1, a3), ..., d(a1, an)} + 2. Then, for any a, b ∈ A, d(a, b) ≤ M, which means A is bounded.\n\nNow, let's solve the numerical problem:\n\nLet X be the interval [0,1] with the Euclidean topology, and let A = {1/n | n ∈ ℕ}. We want to prove that A is compact and find its infimum and supremum.\n\nProof of compactness:\nWe will use the Heine-Borel theorem, which states that a subset of ℝ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. We already know that A is bounded since it is a subset of the bounded interval [0,1].\n\nTo show that A is closed, we need to show that its complement in [0,1], [0,1]\\A, is open. Let x be an element in [0,1]\\A. If x = 0, there exists an n ∈ ℕ such that 0 < x < 1/n, and we can take the open interval (0, 1/n) as a neighborhood of x that does not intersect A. If x > 0, there exists an n ∈ ℕ such that 1/(n+1) < x < 1/n. Then, the open interval (1/(n+1), 1/n) is a neighborhood of x that does not intersect A. In both cases, we have found an open neighborhood of x that does not intersect A, so [0,1]\\A is open, and A is closed.\n\nSince A is closed and bounded, by the Heine-Borel theorem, A is compact.\n\nInfimum and supremum:\nThe infimum of A is the greatest lower bound of A. Since 0 is a lower bound of A (as all elements of A are positive), and for any ε > 0, there exists an n ∈ ℕ such that 1/n < ε (by the Archimedean property), we have that the infimum of A is 0.\n\nThe supremum of A is the least upper bound of A. Since 1 is an upper bound of A (as all elements of A are less than or equal to 1), and for any ε > 0, there exists an n ∈ ℕ such that 1 - 1/n < 1 - ε, we have that the supremum of A is 1."
