    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product A × B, we form ordered pairs with the elements of A as the first component and the elements of B as the second component. \n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product B × A by forming ordered pairs with the elements of B as the first component and the elements of A as the second component.\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are different. For example, (1, 4) is in A × B, but not in B × A, and (4, 1) is in B × A, but not in A × B. Since the Cartesian products A × B and B × A are not equal, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
