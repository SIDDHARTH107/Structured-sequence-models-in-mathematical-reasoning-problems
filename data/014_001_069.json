Convert the letters of the message to numbers using the ASCII table, encrypt the message using RSA encryption, and then decrypt it using your friend's private key (d = 43, n = 77).

    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the message \"HELLO\" to numbers using the ASCII table:\n\nH -> 72\nE -> 69\nL -> 76\nL -> 76\nO -> 79\n\nNow we have the numerical representation of the message: 72, 69, 76, 76, 79.\n\nNext, we will encrypt the message using the RSA encryption with the public key (e = 7, n = 77). To do this, we will raise each number to the power of e and then take the remainder when divided by n:\n\nEncrypted message:\n72^7 % 77 = 29\n69^7 % 77 = 52\n76^7 % 77 = 62\n76^7 % 77 = 62\n79^7 % 77 = 10\n\nThe encrypted message is: 29, 52, 62, 62, 10.\n\nNow, we will decrypt the message using the private key (d = 43, n = 77). We will raise each number of the encrypted message to the power of d and then take the remainder when divided by n:\n\nDecrypted message:\n29^43 % 77 = 72\n52^43 % 77 = 69\n62^43 % 77 = 76\n62^43 % 77 = 76\n10^43 % 77 = 79\n\nThe decrypted message is: 72, 69, 76, 76, 79.\n\nFinally, we will convert the numbers back to letters using the ASCII table:\n\n72 -> H\n69 -> E\n76 -> L\n76 -> L\n79 -> O\n\nThe decrypted message in letters is \"HELLO\"."
