    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has a radius of 6 cm, and the central angle of the sector measures 45°. What is the perimeter of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nThe length of the arc can be found using the formula:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360°) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle, and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nArc length = (45° / 360°) × 2π(6 cm)\nArc length = (1/8) × 12π cm\nArc length = 3π cm\n\nNow, we add the two radii (each 6 cm) to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 × radius\nPerimeter = 3π cm + 2 × 6 cm\nPerimeter = 3π cm + 12 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is 3π + 12 cm."
