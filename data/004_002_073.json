    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4x - 5) / (x - 5) as x approaches 5, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 5 = (x - 5)(x + 1)\n\nNow, the function can be written as:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 5)(x + 1)) / (x - 5)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 5) terms:\n\nf(x) = x + 1\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 5:\n\nlim (x -> 5) (x + 1) = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4x - 5) / (x - 5) as x approaches 5 is 6."
