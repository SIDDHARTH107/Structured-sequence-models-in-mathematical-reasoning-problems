    "message_2": "To perform cluster analysis on the given dataset, we can use the k-means clustering algorithm. Since we want to group the students into two distinct clusters, we will set k=2. Here's a step-by-step process to perform k-means clustering:\n\n1. Normalize the data: Since the scores are on the same scale (0-100), normalization is not necessary in this case.\n\n2. Initialize cluster centroids: Randomly select two students' scores as the initial centroids for the two clusters.\n\n3. Assign each student to the nearest centroid: Calculate the Euclidean distance between each student's scores and the centroids, and assign each student to the cluster with the nearest centroid.\n\n4. Update centroids: Calculate the mean scores for each cluster and update the centroids with these new mean values.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until convergence: Continue iterating through steps 3 and 4 until the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot perform the k-means clustering algorithm directly on the given dataset as I am an AI language model and cannot process tables. However, you can use software like Python with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, or R with the kmeans() function to perform the clustering analysis on the dataset."
