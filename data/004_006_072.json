    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^3 - 10x^2 + 6x - 1, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^3 - 10x^2 + 6x - 1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 9x^2 - 20x + 6\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n9x^2 - 20x + 6 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 9, b = -20, and c = 6.\n\nx = (20 ± √((-20)^2 - 4 * 9 * 6)) / (2 * 9)\nx = (20 ± √(400 - 216)) / 18\nx = (20 ± √184) / 18\n\nSo, the critical points are:\n\nx = (20 + √184) / 18\nx = (20 - √184) / 18"
