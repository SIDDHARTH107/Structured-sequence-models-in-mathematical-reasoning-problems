    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation of the person with respect to the top of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. Let's denote the angle of elevation as θ, the height of the building as h, and the distance between the person and the base of the building as d.\n\nWe are given:\nh = 50 meters\nangle of observation = 60 degrees\n\nUsing the tangent function:\ntan(60) = h/d\n\nWe know that tan(60) = √3, so:\n√3 = 50/d\n\nNow, we can solve for d:\nd = 50/√3 ≈ 28.87 meters\n\nNow that we have the distance, we can find the angle of elevation θ using the inverse tangent function (arctan):\n\nθ = arctan(h/d)\nθ = arctan(50/28.87)\nθ ≈ 60 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of elevation of the person with respect to the top of the building is approximately 60 degrees."
