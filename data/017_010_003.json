    "message_2": "A group of order 10 has a prime factorization of 10 = 2 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, we can determine the number of subgroups of order 2 and 5.\n\nFor subgroups of order 2 (2-Sylow subgroups), we have the following possibilities:\n1. The number of 2-Sylow subgroups divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is 1 subgroup of order 2.\n\nFor subgroups of order 5 (5-Sylow subgroups), we have the following possibilities:\n1. The number of 5-Sylow subgroups divides 2 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is 1 subgroup of order 5.\n\nSo, a group of order 10 has 1 subgroup of order 2, 1 subgroup of order 5, and the trivial subgroup (order 1) and the entire group itself (order 10). In total, there are 4 subgroups.\n\nNow, let's determine if the group is isomorphic to the cyclic, dihedral, or non-abelian group of order 10.\n\n1. Cyclic group: A group of order 10 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 10. Since there is only one subgroup of order 5, there must be an element of order 5 in the group. Similarly, there must be an element of order 2. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_10.\n\n2. Dihedral group: The dihedral group of order 10, D_5, has 10 elements and is non-abelian. However, the group we found is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_10, which is abelian. Therefore, the group is not isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 10.\n\n3. Non-abelian group: Since the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_10, which is abelian, it cannot be a non-abelian group.\n\nIn conclusion, the group of order 10 is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_10, and the number of subgroups (4 subgroups) helped us determine this."
