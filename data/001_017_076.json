    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x) + log2(x-6) = 4, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nlog2(x) + log2(x-6) = log2(x(x-6))\n\nNow, we can set the equation equal to 4:\n\nlog2(x(x-6)) = 4\n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, we can use the property of logarithms that states that if logb(a) = c, then a = b^c. In this case, we have:\n\nx(x-6) = 2^4\n\nx(x-6) = 16\n\nNow, we can distribute the x:\n\nx^2 - 6x = 16\n\nTo solve for x, we can set the equation equal to zero:\n\nx^2 - 6x - 16 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 8)(x + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 8 = 0 => x = 8\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with logarithms, we cannot have a negative value inside the logarithm. Therefore, x = -2 is not a valid solution. The only valid solution is:\n\nx = 8"
