    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a vector bundle is equal to the Euler characteristic of its base space. In this case, the base space is the 2-sphere $S^2$. The Euler characteristic of $S^2$ is given by the formula:\n\nχ(S^2) = V - E + F,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces in a triangulation of the sphere.\n\nA simple triangulation of the sphere is given by an octahedron, which has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces. Therefore, the Euler characteristic of $S^2$ is:\n\nχ(S^2) = 6 - 12 + 8 = 2.\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic of the given vector bundle over $S^2$ is also 2."
