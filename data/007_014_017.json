    "message_2": "The seventh perfect number is 137438691328.\n\nPerfect numbers can be derived from Mersenne primes using the formula (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^p - 1.\n\nThe first seven Mersenne primes are:\n1. 2^2 - 1 = 3\n2. 2^3 - 1 = 7\n3. 2^5 - 1 = 31\n4. 2^7 - 1 = 127\n5. 2^13 - 1 = 8191\n6. 2^17 - 1 = 131071\n7. 2^19 - 1 = 524287\n\nUsing the formula (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1) for each of these Mersenne primes, we get the first seven perfect numbers:\n\n1. (2^(2-1)) * (2^2 - 1) = 6\n2. (2^(3-1)) * (2^3 - 1) = 28\n3. (2^(5-1)) * (2^5 - 1) = 496\n4. (2^(7-1)) * (2^7 - 1) = 8128\n5. (2^(13-1)) * (2^13 - 1) = 33550336\n6. (2^(17-1)) * (2^17 - 1) = 8589869056\n7. (2^(19-1)) * (2^19 - 1) = 137438691328"
