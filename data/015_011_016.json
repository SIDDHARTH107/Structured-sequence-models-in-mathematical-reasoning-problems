    "message_1": "Consider a double pendulum consisting of two rods of length 1 meter each. The initial angles of the rods with respect to the vertical are 10 and 20 degrees, respectively. The mass of the bobs at the ends of the rods are 0.5 and 0.3 kg respectively.\n\nWhat is the maximum angle reached by the second bob during its oscillations after 100 seconds? Round off the answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum is a highly nonlinear system, and its motion is chaotic, meaning that it is very sensitive to initial conditions and difficult to predict analytically. To find the maximum angle reached by the second bob during its oscillations after 100 seconds, we would need to use numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to simulate the motion of the double pendulum.\n\nHowever, as a mathematician, I cannot perform these numerical simulations directly. I recommend using a numerical software package, such as MATLAB or Python, to simulate the motion of the double pendulum and find the maximum angle reached by the second bob after 100 seconds."
