    "message_2": "Given that B ∪ A' = C ∪ A', we want to prove that B = C.\n\nFirst, let's find the complement of set A, denoted as A'. Since A contains integers from 1 to 10, A' will contain all integers that are not in A. However, since A contains all integers from 1 to 10, A' will be an empty set, i.e., A' = {}.\n\nNow, let's substitute A' in the given equation:\n\nB ∪ {} = C ∪ {}\n\nSince the union of any set with an empty set is the set itself, we have:\n\nB = C\n\nThus, we have proved that B = C."
