    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, and its length increases with each iteration. After each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of 3. \n\nTo find the total length of the Peano curve after the first 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (3 ^ Number of Iterations)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and the number of iterations is 5.\n\nLength = 1 * (3 ^ 5)\nLength = 1 * 243\nLength = 243\n\nSo, the total length of the Peano curve after the first 5 iterations is 243."
