Using fuzzy logic, determine the linguistic values of the temperature in the following sets: \n\n1) Cold: 0-10°C\n2) Cool: 5-20°C\n3) Warm: 15-30°C\n4) Hot: 25-40°C\n\nAssign degrees of membership (between 0 and 1) to each set based on the sensor’s reading.",
    "message_2": "To determine the linguistic values of the temperature using fuzzy logic, we will calculate the degree of membership for each set based on the sensor's reading of 22°C.\n\n1) Cold: 0-10°C\nSince 22°C is outside the range of the Cold set, the degree of membership is 0.\n\n2) Cool: 5-20°C\n22°C is outside the range of the Cool set, so the degree of membership is 0.\n\n3) Warm: 15-30°C\n22°C is within the range of the Warm set. To calculate the degree of membership, we can use the following formula:\n\nDegree of membership = (Temperature - Lower limit) / (Upper limit - Lower limit)\n\nDegree of membership (Warm) = (22 - 15) / (30 - 15) = 7 / 15 ≈ 0.467\n\n4) Hot: 25-40°C\n22°C is below the lower limit of the Hot set. However, since it's close to the lower limit, we can calculate the degree of membership using the following formula:\n\nDegree of membership = (Upper limit - Temperature) / (Upper limit - Lower limit)\n\nDegree of membership (Hot) = (25 - 22) / (25 - 15) = 3 / 10 = 0.3\n\nSo, the degrees of membership for each set are:\n\n1) Cold: 0\n2) Cool: 0\n3) Warm: 0.467\n4) Hot: 0.3"
