    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 11^23 is divided by 5. Since 5 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem, 11^5 ≡ 11 (mod 5). Now, we want to find 11^23 (mod 5). We can rewrite 11^23 as (11^5)^4 * 11^3. \n\nUsing the theorem, we know that 11^5 ≡ 11 (mod 5), so (11^5)^4 ≡ 11^4 (mod 5). Now we just need to find 11^4 (mod 5) and 11^3 (mod 5).\n\n11^4 = (11^2)^2 = 121^2 ≡ 1^2 (mod 5) = 1 (mod 5)\n11^3 = 11 * 11^2 = 11 * 121 ≡ 11 * 1 (mod 5) = 11 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we can multiply these results together:\n\n(11^5)^4 * 11^3 ≡ 11^4 * 11^3 (mod 5) ≡ 1 * 11 (mod 5) ≡ 11 (mod 5)\n\nSo, the remainder when 11^23 is divided by 5 is 1."
