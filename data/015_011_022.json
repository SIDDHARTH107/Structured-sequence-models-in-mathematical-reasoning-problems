    "message_1": "What is the smallest change in the initial angle of the first pendulum of a double pendulum system that will cause a significant change (e.g. at least 90 degrees) in the final angle of the second pendulum after a certain number of swings (e.g. 10 swings)? Assume that the length of each pendulum arm is 1 meter and the initial angle of both pendulums is 30 degrees.",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is highly sensitive to initial conditions and is a classic example of a chaotic system. Due to the chaotic nature of the double pendulum, it is difficult to predict the exact change in the initial angle that will cause a significant change in the final angle of the second pendulum after a certain number of swings.\n\nHowever, we can use numerical simulations to approximate the smallest change in the initial angle that will cause a significant change in the final angle of the second pendulum. This can be done by simulating the double pendulum system with slightly different initial angles and observing the change in the final angle of the second pendulum.\n\nFor example, you can start by simulating the double pendulum system with an initial angle of 30 degrees for both pendulums and then incrementally increase the initial angle of the first pendulum by a small amount (e.g., 0.001 degrees) until the final angle of the second pendulum changes by at least 90 degrees after 10 swings.\n\nKeep in mind that the exact value of the smallest change in the initial angle will depend on the specific simulation and the chaotic nature of the double pendulum system."
