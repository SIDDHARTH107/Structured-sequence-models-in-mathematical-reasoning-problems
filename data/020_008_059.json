    "message_1": "A shipping company is given the task to transport goods from city A to city F. The distance between the cities is 150 km. The company has three truck options: a small truck that carries 20 tons of goods, a medium truck that carries 40 tons of goods, and a large truck that carries 60 tons of goods. The small truck travels at an average speed of 60 km/hr, the medium truck travels at an average speed of 80 km/hr, and the large truck travels at an average speed of 100 km/hr. The company wants to transport a total of 200 tons of goods, and they want to do it in the least time possible. How many trucks of each type should the company use to transport the goods?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the time taken to transport the goods, the company should prioritize using the fastest trucks available. In this case, the large truck is the fastest, traveling at an average speed of 100 km/hr.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many large trucks are needed to transport 200 tons of goods:\n\n200 tons / 60 tons per large truck = 3.33 trucks\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a truck, the company will need to use 3 large trucks, which will carry a total of 180 tons (3 * 60 tons).\n\nNow, there are 20 tons of goods remaining to be transported. The company can use a medium truck to carry these remaining goods, as it is faster than the small truck.\n\nSo, the company should use 3 large trucks and 1 medium truck to transport the goods in the least time possible. No small trucks are needed in this case."
