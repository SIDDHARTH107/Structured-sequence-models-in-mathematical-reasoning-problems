The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nA' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets contains all the elements from both sets, without repetition.\n\nA âˆª A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
