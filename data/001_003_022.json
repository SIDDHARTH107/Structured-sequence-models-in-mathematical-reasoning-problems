    "message_2": "We can use the substitution method to solve this system of linear equations. First, we'll solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 7 - 2y\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n3(7 - 2y) - 4y = -10\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n21 - 6y - 4y = -10\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n21 - 10y = -10\n\nNow, isolate y:\n\n10y = 31\n\ny = 31/10\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = 7 - 2(31/10)\n\nx = 7 - 62/10\n\nx = (70 - 62)/10\n\nx = 8/10\n\nx = 4/5\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4/5 and y = 31/10."
