    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the parabola, we can use the vertex formula for a quadratic equation in the form y = ax² + bx + c, which is:\n\nVertex (h, k) = (-b / 2a, f(-b / 2a))\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 3, and c = -4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nh = -3 / (2 * 2) = -3 / 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y (k) when x = h:\n\nk = 2(-3/4)² + 3(-3/4) - 4\nk = 2(9/16) - 9/4 - 4\nk = 9/8 - 9/4 - 32/8\nk = -23/8\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-3/4, -23/8).\n\nTo graph the equation, we can create a table of values for x and y:\n\nx      | y\n-------\n-2   | 2(-2)² + 3(-2) - 4 = 8 - 6 - 4 = -2\n-1   | 2(-1)² + 3(-1) - 4 = 2 - 3 - 4 = -5\n0    | 2(0)² + 3(0) - 4 = -4\n1    | 2(1)² + 3(1) - 4 = 2 + 3 - 4 = 1\n2    | 2(2)² + 3(2) - 4 = 8 + 6 - 4 = 10\n\nNow, plot these points on the coordinate plane and draw a smooth curve through them to create the parabola. The vertex of the parabola is (-3/4, -23/8), which is the lowest point on the graph."
