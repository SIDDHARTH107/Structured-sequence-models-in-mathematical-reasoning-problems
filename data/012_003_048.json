    "message_2": "The size of the maximum independent set in a graph with 8 vertices depends on the structure of the graph. In the worst-case scenario, where all vertices are connected to each other (a complete graph), the maximum independent set would be of size 1, as no two vertices can be part of the independent set without being connected by an edge.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, where the graph is an empty graph (no edges between vertices), the maximum independent set would be of size 8, as all vertices can be part of the independent set without violating the condition that no two vertices in the set are connected by an edge.\n\nIn general, the size of the maximum independent set in a graph with 8 vertices can range from 1 to 8, depending on the graph's structure."
