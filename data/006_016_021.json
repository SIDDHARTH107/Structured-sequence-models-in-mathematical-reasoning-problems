    "message_1": "A factory produces 5000 light bulbs per day. The probability of a bulb being defective is 0.05. What is the probability that out of 5000 bulbs produced in a day, exactly 300 bulbs will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective bulbs,\n- n is the total number of bulbs produced (in this case, 5000),\n- x is the number of defective bulbs we want to find the probability for (in this case, 300),\n- p is the probability of a bulb being defective (0.05), and\n- nCx is the number of combinations of choosing x items from a set of n items, which can be calculated as n! / (x!(n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(300) = (5000C300) * (0.05^300) * (0.95^4700)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 5000C300:\n\n5000C300 = 5000! / (300!(5000-300)!)\n= 5000! / (300! * 4700!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(300) = (5000C300) * (0.05^300) * (0.95^4700)\n\nCalculating this probability directly might be difficult due to the large numbers involved. Instead, we can use a software or calculator that can handle large numbers and compute binomial probabilities. Using such a tool, we get:\n\nP(300) â‰ˆ 0.0103\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 300 defective bulbs out of 5000 produced in a day is approximately 0.0103 or 1.03%."
