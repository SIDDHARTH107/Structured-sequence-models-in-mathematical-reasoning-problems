    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, it is known that 5% of the products are defective. If a company produces 5000 products, what is the probability that at most 250 of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- n is the total number of products (in this case, 5000)\n- k is the number of defective products (we want to find the probability of at most 250 defective products)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (5% or 0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of a product not being defective (95% or 0.95)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at most 250 defective products, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for having 0 defective products, 1 defective product, 2 defective products, ..., up to 250 defective products. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nP(X ≤ 250) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 250\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean μ = n * p and standard deviation σ = √(n * p * (1-p)) when n is large and p is not too close to 0 or 1.\n\nIn this case, μ = 5000 * 0.05 = 250 and σ = √(5000 * 0.05 * 0.95) ≈ 15.81.\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) to find the probability of having at most 250 defective products. First, we need to convert the value 250 to a Z-score:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ = (250 - 250) / 15.81 = 0\n\nNow, we can use a Z-table or a calculator to find the probability of having a Z-score less than or equal to 0. Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric around 0, P(Z ≤ 0) = 0.5.\n\nSo, the probability of having at most 250 defective products is approximately 0.5 or 50%."
