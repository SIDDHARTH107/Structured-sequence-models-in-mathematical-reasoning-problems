    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of tables: standard and deluxe. Each standard table requires 4 hours of carpentry work and 2 hours of painting, while each deluxe table requires 3 hours of carpentry work and 4 hours of painting. The company has 20 carpenters and 16 painters available for the production of tables. If the profit on each standard table is $60 and on each deluxe table is $80, how many tables of each type should the company produce to maximize profit?\n\nFormulate the above problem as a linear programming problem, and solve it using matrix methods. What is the maximum profit that the company can make? How many standard and deluxe tables should the company produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of standard tables and y be the number of deluxe tables.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 60x + 80y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Carpentry work: 4x + 3y ≤ 20 * 8 (since there are 20 carpenters and each can work for 8 hours a day)\n2. Painting work: 2x + 4y ≤ 16 * 8 (since there are 16 painters and each can work for 8 hours a day)\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can rewrite the constraints as:\n1. y ≤ (20 * 8 - 4x) / 3\n2. y ≤ (16 * 8 - 2x) / 4\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem using matrix methods, we first need to find the feasible region's vertices. We can do this by finding the intersection points of the constraints.\n\nIntersection points:\n1. y = (20 * 8 - 4x) / 3 and y = (16 * 8 - 2x) / 4\n2. x = 0 and y = (20 * 8 - 4x) / 3\n3. x = 0 and y = (16 * 8 - 2x) / 4\n4. x = 0 and y = 0\n\nSolving these intersection points, we get:\n1. x = 16, y = 16\n2. x = 0, y = 32/3 ≈ 10.67\n3. x = 0, y = 32\n4. x = 0, y = 0\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function (P = 60x + 80y) at each of these vertices:\n1. P(16, 16) = 60 * 16 + 80 * 16 = 2240\n2. P(0, 10.67) = 60 * 0 + 80 * 10.67 ≈ 853.6\n3. P(0, 32) = 60 * 0 + 80 * 32 = 2560\n4. P(0, 0) = 60 * 0 + 80 * 0 = 0\n\nThe maximum profit is $2560 when the company produces 0 standard tables and 32 deluxe tables."
