    "message_2": "To find the sine, cosine, and tangent of a 60-degree angle using the unit circle, we can use the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle. \n\nFor a 60-degree angle (which is equivalent to π/3 radians), the coordinates of the point on the unit circle are:\n\nx = cos(60°) = cos(π/3) = 1/2\ny = sin(60°) = sin(π/3) = √3/2\n\nNow we can find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent:\n\nsin(60°) = y = √3/2\ncos(60°) = x = 1/2\ntan(60°) = y/x = (√3/2) / (1/2) = √3\n\nSo, the values of sine, cosine, and tangent of a 60-degree angle are:\n\nsin(60°) = √3/2\ncos(60°) = 1/2\ntan(60°) = √3"
