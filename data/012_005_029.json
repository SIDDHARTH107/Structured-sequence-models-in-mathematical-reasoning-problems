    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. We can do this by finding the shortest path between all pairs of vertices and then taking the maximum of these values.\n\nUsing the adjacency matrix, we can compute the shortest path between all pairs of vertices using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. After applying the algorithm, we obtain the following matrix of shortest path lengths:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 3\\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3\\\\\n1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2\\\\\n2 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 3\\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2\\\\\n2 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 3 & 2 & 1\\\\\n3 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 2\\\\\n4 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\n3 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we find the maximum value in this matrix, which is 4. Therefore, the diameter of the graph G is 4."
