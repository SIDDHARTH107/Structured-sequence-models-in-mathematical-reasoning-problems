    "message_1": "Based on historical data, the probability of a person contracting a certain medical condition is 0.03. \nIf a hospital has 5000 patients, how many patients are likely to contract this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of patients likely to contract the medical condition, you can multiply the total number of patients by the probability of contracting the condition.\n\nNumber of patients = 5000\nProbability of contracting the condition = 0.03\n\nExpected number of patients with the condition = 5000 * 0.03 = 150\n\nSo, approximately 150 patients out of the 5000 are likely to contract the medical condition."
