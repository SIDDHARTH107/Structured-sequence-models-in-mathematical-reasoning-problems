    "message_1": "In a group of 5 individuals, each person is given $10 to either contribute to a public fund or keep for themselves. The total amount in the public fund will be multiplied by 1.5 and distributed equally among all 5 individuals. If everyone keeps their money, each person will end up with $10. If everyone contributes their money to the public fund, each person will end up with $15. What is the Nash equilibrium in this situation?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the best response of each individual given the actions of the others. Let's consider two strategies: contribute (C) and keep (K).\n\n1. If all other 4 individuals contribute, the best response for the 5th individual is to keep their money. In this case, the public fund will have $40, which will be multiplied by 1.5 to get $60. The $60 will be distributed equally among all 5 individuals, so each person will get $12. The 5th individual who kept their money will have a total of $22 ($12 from the public fund + $10 they kept).\n\n2. If all other 4 individuals keep their money, the best response for the 5th individual is also to keep their money. In this case, the public fund will have $0, and each person will have $10.\n\nIn both cases, the best response for an individual is to keep their money, given the actions of the others. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium in this situation is for all individuals to keep their money, resulting in each person having $10."
