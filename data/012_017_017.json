    "message_2": "To determine whether graph G has a perfect matching, we can use Tutte's theorem. Tutte's theorem states that a graph G has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of vertices in G, the number of odd components in G - U (the graph obtained by removing U and its incident edges) is less than or equal to |U|.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario for graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges. The worst-case scenario would be a graph where one vertex has the maximum possible degree of 7 (connected to all other vertices) and the other vertices form a cycle. In this case, the graph would look like this:\n\n```\n   1---2\n  / \\ / \\\n 8---7---3\n  \\ / \\ /\n   6---4\n   \\   /\n    \\ /\n     5\n```\n\nNow, let's test Tutte's theorem for this graph. We will consider different subsets U of vertices and check the number of odd components in G - U.\n\n1. |U| = 1: In this case, removing any vertex from the graph will not create any odd components, so the condition holds.\n\n2. |U| = 2: In this case, the worst scenario would be removing vertices 1 and 7, which would create two odd components (2-3-4-6-8 and 5). However, the number of odd components (2) is equal to |U|, so the condition holds.\n\n3. |U| = 3: In this case, the worst scenario would be removing vertices 1, 7, and 5, which would create three odd components (2-3-4-6-8, 3-4, and 6-8). However, the number of odd components (3) is equal to |U|, so the condition holds.\n\n4. |U| = 4: In this case, the worst scenario would be removing vertices 1, 7, 5, and 3, which would create three odd components (2-4-6-8, 4-6, and 6-8). The number of odd components (3) is less than |U|, so the condition holds.\n\nSince the condition of Tutte's theorem holds for all possible subsets U of vertices in the worst-case scenario, we can conclude that graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges has a perfect matching."
