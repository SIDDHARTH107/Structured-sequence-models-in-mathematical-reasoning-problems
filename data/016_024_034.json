    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from an initial larger square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed.\n\nThe total number of squares removed in the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of squares removed = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of squares removed = (8^5 - 1) / 7\nNumber of squares removed = (32768 - 1) / 7\nNumber of squares removed = 32767 / 7\nNumber of squares removed = 4681\n\nSo, in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski carpet, there are 4681 squares removed."
