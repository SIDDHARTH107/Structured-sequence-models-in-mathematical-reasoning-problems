    "message_1": "A trapezium has a parallel side of length 12 cm and another parallel side of length 8 cm. The height of the trapezium is 5 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the longer parallel side a (12 cm), the length of the shorter parallel side b (8 cm), and the height h (5 cm). Let's also call the length of the two non-parallel sides c and d.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of c and d. Since the trapezium is not necessarily an isosceles trapezium, we cannot assume that c and d are equal. Instead, we can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side.\n\nLet's call the length of this perpendicular line x. Now we have two right triangles: one with legs of length x and h, and the other with legs of length (a - b - x) and h.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the first right triangle:\nc^2 = x^2 + h^2\n\nAnd for the second right triangle:\nd^2 = (a - b - x)^2 + h^2\n\nWe don't have enough information to find the exact values of c, d, and x, but we can express the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c + d\n= a + b + sqrt(x^2 + h^2) + sqrt((a - b - x)^2 + h^2)\n\nSubstituting the given values for a, b, and h:\n\nPerimeter = 12 + 8 + sqrt(x^2 + 5^2) + sqrt((12 - 8 - x)^2 + 5^2)\n= 20 + sqrt(x^2 + 25) + sqrt((4 - x)^2 + 25)\n\nThis expression gives the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x. Since we don't have enough information to find the exact value of x, we cannot find the exact perimeter of the trapezium."
