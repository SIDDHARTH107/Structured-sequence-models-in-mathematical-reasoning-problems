    "message_1": "A drink company claims that their cans of soda contain an average of 12 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.5 ounces. A random sample of 36 cans is taken. What is the probability that the sample mean will be less than 11.8 ounces?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the sample mean will be less than 11.8 ounces, we can use the z-score formula for sample means:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 11.8, μ = 12, σ = 0.5, and n = 36.\n\nz = (11.8 - 12) / (0.5 / √36)\nz = (-0.2) / (0.5 / 6)\nz = (-0.2) / 0.083333\nz ≈ -2.4\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in z-score function. The probability that the sample mean will be less than 11.8 ounces corresponds to the area to the left of z = -2.4 on the standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the probability is approximately 0.0082 or 0.82%."
