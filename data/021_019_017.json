The profit obtained from producing one unit of product A is $20, and for product B is $25. The company can only produce a maximum of 900 units of both products combined. It is known that each unit of product B requires two units of product A for its production. How many units of products A and B should the company produce in order to maximize their profit using the Harmony Search Algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The Harmony Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this case, we will use it to find the optimal number of units of products A and B to maximize the profit. Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem using the Harmony Search Algorithm:\n\n1. Define the objective function and constraints:\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 20A + 25B\nConstraints: A + 2B ≤ 900 (maximum units of both products combined)\n             A, B ≥ 0 (non-negative production quantities)\n\n2. Set the algorithm parameters:\n\nHarmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solution vectors in the harmony memory. Let's set it to 10.\nHarmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory. Let's set it to 0.8.\nPitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting a selected value. Let's set it to 0.3.\nNumber of iterations: The number of times the algorithm will be executed. Let's set it to 1000.\n\n3. Initialize the harmony memory:\n\nRandomly generate 10 solution vectors (A, B) that satisfy the constraints and store them in the harmony memory.\n\n4. Improvise a new harmony:\n\nFor each decision variable (A and B), generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than HMCR, select a value from the harmony memory. If the random number is less than PAR, adjust the selected value by adding or subtracting a small random number.\n\n5. Check the new harmony:\n\nIf the new harmony satisfies the constraints, calculate its objective function value (profit).\n\n6. Update the harmony memory:\n\nIf the new harmony has a better objective function value than the worst harmony in the memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 for the specified number of iterations (1000).\n\n8. Find the best solution:\n\nAfter completing the iterations, select the harmony with the highest objective function value (profit) from the harmony memory.\n\nBy following these steps, the Harmony Search Algorithm will provide the optimal number of units of products A and B that the company should produce to maximize their profit."
