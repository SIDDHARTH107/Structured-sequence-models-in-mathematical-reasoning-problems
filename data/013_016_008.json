    "message_1": "Suppose a company is trying to decide whether to invest in a new project or not. If the project is successful, the company will make a profit of $100,000. If the project fails, the company will lose $50,000. However, the outcome of the project depends on the effort of the project manager, who can put in a lot of effort or a little effort. If the project manager puts in a lot of effort, the project has a 90% chance of success. If the project manager puts in little effort, the project only has a 50% chance of success. However, the project manager's effort level is not observable by the company. The project manager receives a bonus of $10,000 if the project is successful, regardless of their effort level. The project manager values the bonus at $5,000. What is the optimal effort level for the project manager, and what is the expected value of the project for the company?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal effort level for the project manager, we need to compare the expected value of the bonus for each effort level.\n\n1. If the project manager puts in a lot of effort:\nThe probability of success is 90%, so the expected value of the bonus is 0.9 * $5,000 = $4,500.\n\n2. If the project manager puts in little effort:\nThe probability of success is 50%, so the expected value of the bonus is 0.5 * $5,000 = $2,500.\n\nSince the expected value of the bonus is higher when the project manager puts in a lot of effort, the optimal effort level for the project manager is to put in a lot of effort.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value of the project for the company:\n\n1. If the project manager puts in a lot of effort:\nThe expected value of the project is 0.9 * $100,000 (profit) - 0.1 * $50,000 (loss) = $90,000 - $5,000 = $85,000.\n\n2. If the project manager puts in little effort:\nThe expected value of the project is 0.5 * $100,000 (profit) - 0.5 * $50,000 (loss) = $50,000 - $25,000 = $25,000.\n\nSince the expected value of the project is higher when the project manager puts in a lot of effort, the company should expect the project manager to put in a lot of effort. Therefore, the expected value of the project for the company is $85,000."
