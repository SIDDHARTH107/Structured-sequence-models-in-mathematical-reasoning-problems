    "message_1": "A car is traveling on a straight road with a velocity given by the function v(t) = 3t^2 - 6t + 2, where t is time in seconds and v(t) is measured in meters per second. Find the acceleration of the car at t=2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car at t=2 seconds, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function v(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the acceleration function a(t).\n\nThe velocity function is v(t) = 3t^2 - 6t + 2.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative:\n\na(t) = dv(t)/dt = d(3t^2 - 6t + 2)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 6t - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at t=2 seconds. Plug t=2 into the acceleration function:\n\na(2) = 6(2) - 6\na(2) = 12 - 6\na(2) = 6\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at t=2 seconds is 6 meters per second squared."
