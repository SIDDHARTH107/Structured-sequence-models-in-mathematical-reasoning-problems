    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) - cos(x) in the interval [0, 2π], we first need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2sin(x) - cos(x))\n\nUsing the derivatives of sine and cosine:\n\nf'(x) = 2cos(x) + sin(x)\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0:\n\n0 = 2cos(x) + sin(x)\n\nTo solve for x, we can use the substitution method. Let's set u = cos(x), then -sin(x) = du/dx.\n\n0 = 2u - du/dx\n\nNow, solve the differential equation:\n\ndu/dx = 2u\n\nSeparate the variables:\n\ndu/u = 2dx\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/u)du = ∫2dx\n\nln|u| = 2x + C\n\nNow, solve for u:\n\nu = e^(2x + C) = e^(2x)e^C\n\nSince u = cos(x), we have:\n\ncos(x) = e^(2x)e^C\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation in the interval [0, 2π]. Notice that e^(2x) is always positive, and the maximum value of cos(x) is 1. Therefore, we must have e^(2x)e^C = 1. This implies that e^(2x) = 1, which means x = 0 or x = π.\n\nNow, we need to check the values of f(x) at these critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = 2sin(0) - cos(0) = 0 - 1 = -1\nf(π) = 2sin(π) - cos(π) = 0 + 1 = 1\nf(2π) = 2sin(2π) - cos(2π) = 0 - 1 = -1\n\nThe maximum value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) - cos(x) in the interval [0, 2π] is 1, which occurs at x = π."
