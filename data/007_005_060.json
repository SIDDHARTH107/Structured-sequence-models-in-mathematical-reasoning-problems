    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 18, and 24, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n12 = 2^2 * 3^1\n18 = 2^1 * 3^2\n24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n\n2. For each prime factor, take the highest power that appears in any of the factorizations:\n2^3 (from 24) and 3^2 (from 18)\n\n3. Multiply these highest powers together:\n2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72\n\nThe least common multiple of 12, 18, and 24 is 72."
