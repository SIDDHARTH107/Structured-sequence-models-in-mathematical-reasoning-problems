    "message_2": "To analytically continue the function f(z) = 2x + 3iy from the upper half-plane to the lower half-plane through the real axis, we first need to check if the function satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nLet f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), where u(x, y) = 2x and v(x, y) = 3y. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n1) ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n2) ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂(2x)/∂x = 2\n∂v/∂y = ∂(3y)/∂y = 3\n∂u/∂y = ∂(2x)/∂y = 0\n∂v/∂x = ∂(3y)/∂x = 0\n\nComparing the partial derivatives with the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n1) 2 = 3 (False)\n2) 0 = 0 (True)\n\nSince the first equation is not satisfied, the function f(z) = 2x + 3iy does not satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations and therefore cannot be analytically continued from the upper half-plane to the lower half-plane through the real axis."
