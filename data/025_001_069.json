    "message_1": "Let's say that we have two algebraic curves, C and D, where the first one is defined by the equation C(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4 and the second one is defined by the equation D(x,y) = x - 2y + 1. The question for the math student to solve would be:\n\nWhat is the number of intersection points between curves C and D in the xy-plane?",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection points between curves C and D, we need to solve the system of equations formed by C(x,y) and D(x,y):\n\n1) x^2 + y^2 = 4\n2) x - 2y = 1\n\nFirst, we can solve equation (2) for x:\n\nx = 2y + 1\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into equation (1):\n\n(2y + 1)^2 + y^2 = 4\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n4y^2 + 4y + 1 + y^2 = 4\n5y^2 + 4y - 3 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for y. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = 4, and c = -3:\n\ny = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4*5*(-3))) / (2*5)\ny = (-4 ± √(16 + 60)) / 10\ny = (-4 ± √76) / 10\n\nSo, we have two possible values for y:\n\ny1 = (-4 + √76) / 10\ny2 = (-4 - √76) / 10\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding x values using the expression for x:\n\nx1 = 2y1 + 1\nx2 = 2y2 + 1\n\nThus, we have two intersection points:\n\nIntersection Point 1: (x1, y1)\nIntersection Point 2: (x2, y2)\n\nSo, there are 2 intersection points between curves C and D in the xy-plane."
