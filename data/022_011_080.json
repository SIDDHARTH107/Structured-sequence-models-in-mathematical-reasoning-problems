    "message_2": "For the function f(z) = (z+3)^4 / (z-2)^3, we can identify the zeros and poles by examining the numerator and denominator.\n\nAt z = -3:\nThe numerator (z+3)^4 becomes (0)^4 = 0, while the denominator (z-2)^3 does not equal 0. Since the numerator is 0 and the denominator is not 0, there is a zero at z = -3. The order of the zero is determined by the exponent of the factor (z+3) in the numerator, which is 4. Therefore, there is a zero of order 4 at z = -3.\n\nAt z = 2:\nThe numerator (z+3)^4 does not equal 0, while the denominator (z-2)^3 becomes (0)^3 = 0. Since the numerator is not 0 and the denominator is 0, there is a pole at z = 2. The order of the pole is determined by the exponent of the factor (z-2) in the denominator, which is 3. Therefore, there is a pole of order 3 at z = 2."
