    "message_2": "First, let's find the possible Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: G is a cyclic group.\nIf G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C36.\n\nCase 2: G is a direct product of two smaller groups.\nIf G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, then G is isomorphic to A4 × C3.\n\nCase 3: G is a non-abelian group.\nIf G has three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups, then G is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nTo classify G, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine if G is abelian or non-abelian. If G is abelian, it is either cyclic or a direct product of two smaller groups.\n\n2. If G is cyclic, find a generator of G. The generator will have order 36, and G will be isomorphic to C36.\n\n3. If G is a direct product of two smaller groups, find the unique 3-Sylow subgroup. If it is isomorphic to C3, then G is isomorphic to A4 × C3.\n\n4. If G is non-abelian, find the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. There will be three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. The structure of G will depend on the specific actions of these subgroups.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36. To classify G, we need to determine its structure based on its Sylow subgroups and their actions."
