    "message_2": "The Lorenz system is a set of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given by:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\ndy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y\ndz/dt = xy - βz\n\nwhere σ, ρ, and β are constants, and x(t), y(t), and z(t) are functions of time t. To find the solution y(10) at time t = 10, we need to numerically solve the system of ODEs with the given initial conditions and parameters.\n\nHere's a Python code using the `scipy` library to solve the Lorenz system and find y(10):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef lorenz_system(t, xyz, sigma, rho, beta):\n    x, y, z = xyz\n    dx_dt = sigma * (y - x)\n    dy_dt = x * (rho - z) - y\n    dz_dt = x * y - beta * z\n    return [dx_dt, dy_dt, dz_dt]\n\nsigma = 10\nrho = 28\nbeta = 8/3\ninitial_conditions = [1, 1, 1.05]\nt_span = (0, 10)\n\nsol = solve_ivp(lorenz_system, t_span, initial_conditions, args=(sigma, rho, beta), dense_output=True)\ny_10 = sol.sol(10)[1]\n\nprint(\"y(10) =\", y_10)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the numerical value of y(10) for the given Lorenz system. Note that the Lorenz system is sensitive to initial conditions, so small changes in the initial conditions can lead to different results."
