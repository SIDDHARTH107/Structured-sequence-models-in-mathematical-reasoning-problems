    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * ln(x), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x) * h(x), then the derivative f'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x).\n\nLet g(x) = x^2 and h(x) = ln(x). Then, we need to find the derivatives g'(x) and h'(x).\n\ng'(x) = d(x^2)/dx = 2x\nh'(x) = d(ln(x))/dx = 1/x\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x)\nf'(x) = (2x) * (ln(x)) + (x^2) * (1/x)\nf'(x) = 2x * ln(x) + x\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 3:\n\nf'(3) = 2(3) * ln(3) + 3\nf'(3) = 6 * ln(3) + 3\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * ln(x) at x = 3 is f'(3) = 6 * ln(3) + 3."
