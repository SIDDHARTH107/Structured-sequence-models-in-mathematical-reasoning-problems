    "message_1": "Suppose a company has 150 employees and there is a 5% chance that a given employee would commit financial fraud. What is the probability that at least 7 employees out of 150 commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k employees committing financial fraud\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of an employee committing financial fraud (5% or 0.05)\n- n is the total number of employees (150)\n- k is the number of employees committing financial fraud (7 or more)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 7 employees committing financial fraud, we need to calculate the probability of 7, 8, 9, ..., 150 employees committing financial fraud and sum them up. However, it's easier to calculate the complementary probability (the probability of 0 to 6 employees committing financial fraud) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, let's calculate the probability of 0 to 6 employees committing financial fraud:\n\nP(X ≤ 6) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 6)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula for each term and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≤ 6) = Σ [C(150, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(150-k)] for k = 0 to 6\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 6) ≈ 0.3614\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 7 employees committing financial fraud by subtracting the complementary probability from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 1 - P(X ≤ 6) = 1 - 0.3614 ≈ 0.6386\n\nSo, the probability that at least 7 employees out of 150 commit financial fraud is approximately 63.86%."
