    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 72 and 90 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (90) by the smaller number (72) and find the remainder.\n   90 รท 72 = 1 with a remainder of 18.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (90) with the smaller number (72) and the smaller number with the remainder (18).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 72 and 18.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (72) by the new smaller number (18) and find the remainder.\n   72 รท 18 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 18.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 90 is 18."
