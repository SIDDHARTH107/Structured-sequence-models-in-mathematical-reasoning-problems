    "message_2": "The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 100π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 100π square centimeters or approximately 314.16 square centimeters."
