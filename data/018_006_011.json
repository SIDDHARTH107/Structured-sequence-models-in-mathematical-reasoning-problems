    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set and A be a subset of U, such that U contains exactly 100 elements and A contains exactly 60 elements. What is the cardinality of the complement of set A? Verify if the union of set A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "Let A' be the complement of set A. Since A is a subset of U and contains 60 elements, the remaining elements in U that are not in A will be in A'. The cardinality of A' can be found by subtracting the number of elements in A from the total number of elements in U:\n\nCardinality of A' = |U| - |A| = 100 - 60 = 40\n\nSo, the cardinality of the complement of set A is 40.\n\nNow, let's verify if the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements that are in either one of the sets or in both. Since A and A' are complementary sets, their union will contain all elements in U:\n\nA âˆª A' = U\n\nTherefore, the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
