    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, employees getting injured) in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (employees getting injured), k is the number of events we want to find the probability for, λ (lambda) is the average number of events (in this case, 5 employees getting injured per year), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 2 employees getting injured, which means we need to find the probability of 2 or more employees getting injured. To do this, we can find the probability of 0 or 1 employee getting injured and then subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\n\nFirst, let's find P(X = 0) and P(X = 1):\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-5) * 5^0) / 0! = (0.0067 * 1) / 1 = 0.0067\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-5) * 5^1) / 1! = (0.0067 * 5) / 1 = 0.0337\n\nNow, we can find P(X ≥ 2):\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) = 1 - 0.0067 - 0.0337 = 0.9596\n\nSo, the probability of at least 2 employees getting injured in a year while working with heavy machinery in this factory is approximately 0.9596 or 95.96%."
