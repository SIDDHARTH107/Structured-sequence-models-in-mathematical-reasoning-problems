    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 2^4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16 and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G, and |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 16 * 3 / 1 = 48. Thus, G = PQ. Since P is a normal subgroup of G and Q is a subgroup of G, G is a semidirect product of P and Q. However, since P and Q have trivial intersection and their orders are relatively prime, G is actually a direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 48, so G ≅ C48.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since there are multiple Sylow subgroups for both 2 and 3, neither P nor Q is normal in G. Thus, G cannot be a direct product of P and Q. However, G can still be a semidirect product of P and Q, which would result in a non-abelian group. There are 14 possible non-abelian groups of order 48, and G could be isomorphic to one of them.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 16, which is normal in G, and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, G can be a semidirect product of P and Q. If G is a non-abelian group, it could be one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. However, if G is an abelian group, then G ≅ P × Q. Since P has order 16 and Q has order 3, G would be isomorphic to C16 × C3, which is not isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C48, one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, or an abelian group not isomorphic to A4 × C4. We cannot determine the exact isomorphism class of G without more information."
