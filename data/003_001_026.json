    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The angle of inclination between the ladder and the ground is 60 degrees, and the distance between the foot of the ladder and the wall is 6 meters. What is the length of the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the trigonometric function tangent (tan). The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of inclination between the ladder and the ground is 60 degrees, the distance between the foot of the ladder and the wall (adjacent side) is 6 meters, and we need to find the length of the ladder (hypotenuse).\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\ntan(60) = height of the wall / 6 meters\n\nSince tan(60) = √3, we have:\n\n√3 = height of the wall / 6 meters\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the wall:\n\nheight of the wall = 6 meters * √3 = 6√3 meters\n\nNow that we have the height of the wall, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the ladder (hypotenuse):\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a is the distance between the foot of the ladder and the wall (6 meters), b is the height of the wall (6√3 meters), and c is the length of the ladder.\n\n(6)^2 + (6√3)^2 = c^2\n\n36 + 108 = c^2\n\n144 = c^2\n\nc = √144\n\nc = 12\n\nSo, the length of the ladder is 12 meters."
