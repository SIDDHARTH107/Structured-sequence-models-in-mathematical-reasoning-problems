    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nIn our case, p = 37 (which is a prime number) and a = 24. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n24^37 ≡ 24 (mod 37)\n\nSo, when 24^37 is divided by 37, the remainder is 24."
