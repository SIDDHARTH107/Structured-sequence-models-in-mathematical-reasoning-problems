    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinants.\n\nGiven system of equations:\n2x + 3y = 7\n4x - 5y = -3\n\nThe main determinant (D) is:\nD = | 2  3 |\n      | 4 -5 |\n\nD = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4)\nD = -10 - 12\nD = -22\n\nNow, we need to find the determinant for x (Dx):\nReplace the first column of the main determinant with the constants (7 and -3):\nDx = | 7  3 |\n         | -3 -5 |\n\nDx = (7 * -5) - (3 * -3)\nDx = -35 + 9\nDx = -26\n\nNow, we need to find the determinant for y (Dy):\nReplace the second column of the main determinant with the constants (7 and -3):\nDy = | 2  7 |\n         | 4 -3 |\n\nDy = (2 * -3) - (7 * 4)\nDy = -6 - 28\nDy = -34\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y:\nx = Dx / D\nx = -26 / -22\nx = 13/11\n\ny = Dy / D\ny = -34 / -22\ny = 17/11\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 13/11 and y = 17/11."
