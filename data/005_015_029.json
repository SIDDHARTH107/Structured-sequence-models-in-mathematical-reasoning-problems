The data is as follows:\n\n| Customer | Age (years) | Salary (USD) |\n| -------  | ---------- | ------------ |\n| 1        | 25         | 35,000       |\n| 2        | 30         | 40,000       |\n| 3        | 35         | 45,000       |\n| 4        | 40         | 50,000       |\n| 5        | 45         | 55,000       |\n| 6        | 50         | 60,000       |\n| 7        | 55         | 65,000       |\n| 8        | 60         | 70,000       |\n| 9        | 65         | 75,000       |\n| 10       | 70         | 80,000       |\n\nUsing cluster analysis, divide these customers into two groups. What is the average age and salary for each group?",
    "message_2": "To perform cluster analysis, we can use the k-means clustering algorithm. In this case, we want to divide the customers into two groups (k=2). Here are the steps to perform k-means clustering:\n\n1. Initialize two cluster centroids randomly. In this case, we can choose two customers as initial centroids. Let's choose customers 1 and 10 as initial centroids.\n\nCentroid 1: Age = 25, Salary = 35,000\nCentroid 2: Age = 70, Salary = 80,000\n\n2. Assign each customer to the nearest centroid.\n\n3. Update the centroids by calculating the average age and salary of the customers assigned to each centroid.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a certain number of iterations have been reached.\n\nAfter performing the k-means clustering algorithm, we get the following two clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Customers 1 to 5\nCluster 2: Customers 6 to 10\n\nNow, we can calculate the average age and salary for each group:\n\nCluster 1:\nAverage Age = (25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45) / 5 = 175 / 5 = 35 years\nAverage Salary = (35,000 + 40,000 + 45,000 + 50,000 + 55,000) / 5 = 225,000 / 5 = 45,000 USD\n\nCluster 2:\nAverage Age = (50 + 55 + 60 + 65 + 70) / 5 = 300 / 5 = 60 years\nAverage Salary = (60,000 + 65,000 + 70,000 + 75,000 + 80,000) / 5 = 350,000 / 5 = 70,000 USD\n\nSo, the average age and salary for each group are:\n\nCluster 1: Average Age = 35 years, Average Salary = 45,000 USD\nCluster 2: Average Age = 60 years, Average Salary = 70,000 USD"
