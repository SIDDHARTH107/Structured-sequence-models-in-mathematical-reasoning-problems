    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 2  3  1 | 10 |\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 3 -1  2 |  1 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 2  3  1 | 10 |\n| 3 -1  2 |  1 |\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and replace Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n|  1  2 -1 |  3  |\n|  0 -1  3 |  4  |\n|  0 -7  5 | -8  |\n\nStep 3: Multiply Row 2 by -1 to get a 1 in the second row, second column:\n\n|  1  2 -1 |  3  |\n|  0  1 -3 | -4  |\n|  0 -7  5 | -8  |\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 1 with (-2 * Row 2) + Row 1 and replace Row 3 with (7 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n|  1  0  5 | 11  |\n|  0  1 -3 | -4  |\n|  0  0 -16| -20 |\n\nStep 5: Multiply Row 3 by -1/16 to get a 1 in the third row, third column:\n\n|  1  0  5  | 11   |\n|  0  1 -3  | -4   |\n|  0  0  1  | 5/4  |\n\nStep 6: Replace Row 1 with (-5 * Row 3) + Row 1 and replace Row 2 with (3 * Row 3) + Row 2:\n\n|  1  0  0  | 3/4  |\n|  0  1  0  | -1/4 |\n|  0  0  1  | 5/4  |\n\nThe row-echelon form of the augmented matrix represents the following system of linear equations:\n\nx = 3/4\ny = -1/4\nz = 5/4\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3/4, y = -1/4, and z = 5/4."
