    "message_1": "Consider a company that produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit of A is $50, and for B is $70. The company has a limited capacity to produce these two products, and the total capacity is 100 units. It takes 2 hours to produce one unit of A and 3 hours to produce one unit of B. The company has a fixed budget, and the production cost per hour is $30. Using tabu search, determine the number of units of A and B that the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and neighborhood structure. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 50x + 70y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Capacity constraint: x + y <= 100\n2. Time constraint: 2x + 3y <= Budget/30 (We need to know the budget to calculate the exact constraint)\n\nNeighborhood structure: We will consider a solution as a neighbor if it is obtained by increasing/decreasing the production of A or B by 1 unit.\n\nNow, let's perform the tabu search algorithm:\n\n1. Start with an initial solution, for example, x = 50 and y = 50 (producing 50 units of each product).\n2. Calculate the profit for the initial solution.\n3. Generate all neighboring solutions that satisfy the constraints.\n4. Choose the best neighboring solution that is not in the tabu list and update the current solution.\n5. Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list exceeds the tabu tenure.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or no improvement in the best solution for a certain number of iterations).\n\nNote that without knowing the budget, we cannot provide an exact solution. However, once you have the budget, you can follow the tabu search algorithm steps to find the optimal production quantities for products A and B to maximize the profit."
