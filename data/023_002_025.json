    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function $f(x) = x$, we first need to determine the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ for the series representation:\n\n$$f(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} [a_n \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi nx}{P}) + b_n \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi nx}{P})]$$\n\nwhere $P$ is the period of the function. Since $f(x) = x$ is an odd function, all $a_n$ coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the $b_n$ coefficients. The function has a period of $2\\pi$, so $P = 2\\pi$.\n\nTo find the $b_n$ coefficients, we use the following formula:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi nx}{P}) dx$$\n\nFor $f(x) = x$, we have:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi nx}{2\\pi}) dx = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x \\sin(nx) dx$$\n\nNow, we can integrate by parts:\n\nLet $u = x$ and $dv = \\sin(nx) dx$. Then, $du = dx$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{n} \\cos(nx)$.\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$, we get:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[-\\frac{x}{n} \\cos(nx) \\Big|_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} + \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos(nx) dx\\right]$$\n\nThe integral of $\\cos(nx)$ over a full period is zero, so:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[-\\frac{x}{n} \\cos(nx) \\Big|_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[\\frac{2\\pi}{n}(-1)^n\\right] = \\frac{2(-1)^n}{n}$$\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for $f(x) = x$:\n\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2(-1)^n}{n} \\sin(nx)$$\n\nFor the series to converge at $x = \\pi$, we can use the Dirichlet's theorem on Fourier series, which states that if a function has a finite number of discontinuities and is piecewise continuous and piecewise smooth in a period, then the Fourier series converges to the function at all points of continuity and to the average of the left and right limits at points of discontinuity.\n\nSince $f(x) = x$ is continuous and smooth everywhere, the Fourier series converges to the function at all points, including $x = \\pi$."
