    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 7^325 is divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We know that 7 is congruent to 1 modulo 6, which means that 7 and 1 have the same remainder when divided by 6.\n\n7 ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n\nNow, we can raise both sides of the congruence to the power of 325:\n\n(7^325) ≡ (1^325) (mod 6)\n\nSince 1 raised to any power is still 1, we have:\n\n7^325 ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n\nThis means that the remainder when 7^325 is divided by 6 is 1."
