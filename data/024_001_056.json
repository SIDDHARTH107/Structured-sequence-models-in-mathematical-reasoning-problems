    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the vector equation r(t) with respect to t.\n\nGiven r(t) = 2cos(t)i + 2sin(t)j + t^2k, let's find the first derivative:\n\nr'(t) = dr/dt = -2sin(t)i + 2cos(t)j + 2tk\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative:\n\nr''(t) = d²r/dt² = -2cos(t)i - 2sin(t)j + 2k\n\nNow, we need to find the unit tangent vector T(t) and its derivative T'(t). The unit tangent vector T(t) is given by:\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt((-2sin(t))^2 + (2cos(t))^2 + (2t)^2) = sqrt(4sin^2(t) + 4cos^2(t) + 4t^2)\n\nSince sin^2(t) + cos^2(t) = 1, we have:\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(4 + 4t^2)\n\nNow, let's find the unit tangent vector T(t):\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)|| = (-2sin(t)i + 2cos(t)j + 2tk) / sqrt(4 + 4t^2)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of T(t) with respect to t:\n\nT'(t) = (-2cos(t)i - 2sin(t)j + 2k) / sqrt(4 + 4t^2) - (-2sin(t)i + 2cos(t)j + 2tk)(4t) / (4 + 4t^2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature κ(t) using the formula:\n\nκ(t) = ||T'(t)||\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\n\nκ(π/4) = ||T'(π/4)||\n\nNow, let's find the unit normal vector N(t):\n\nN(t) = T'(t) / ||T'(t)||\n\nNow, let's find the binormal vector B(t):\n\nB(t) = T(t) x N(t)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of B(t) with respect to t:\n\nB'(t) = dB/dt\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion τ(t) using the formula:\n\nτ(t) = - (B'(t) • N(t))\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\n\nτ(π/4) = - (B'(π/4) • N(π/4))\n\nSo, the curvature and torsion of the curve at t = π/4 are κ(π/4) and τ(π/4), respectively."
