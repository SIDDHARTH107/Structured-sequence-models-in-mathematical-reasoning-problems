    "message_2": "To prove that $x$ cannot be prime and composite at the same time, we will show that the properties of being prime and composite are mutually exclusive. In other words, if $x$ is prime, it cannot be composite, and if $x$ is composite, it cannot be prime.\n\nLet $P(x)$ denote the property of being prime and $Q(x)$ denote the property of being composite. Recall the definitions of prime and composite numbers:\n\n1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n2. A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that has more than two distinct positive divisors.\n\nNow, let's assume for contradiction that there exists a natural number $x$ such that it is both prime and composite. That is, $P(x) \\land Q(x)$ holds.\n\nSince $x$ is prime, it has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and $x$. However, since $x$ is also composite, it has more than two distinct positive divisors. This is a contradiction, as a number cannot have both exactly two divisors and more than two divisors at the same time.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists a natural number $x$ such that it is both prime and composite is false. In second-order logic, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\forall x (\\neg (P(x) \\land Q(x)))$$\n\nThis statement asserts that for all natural numbers $x$, $x$ cannot be both prime and composite at the same time."
