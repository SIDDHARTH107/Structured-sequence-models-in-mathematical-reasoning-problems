    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 10 for x between -2 and 5, we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5\n\nNow, let's set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 8x + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -8, and c = 5:\n\nx = (8 ± √((-8)^2 - 4(3)(5))) / (2(3))\nx = (8 ± √(64 - 60)) / 6\nx = (8 ± √4) / 6\nx = (8 ± 2) / 6\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (8 + 2) / 6 = 10 / 6 = 5/3\nx = (8 - 2) / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 4(-2)^2 + 5(-2) + 10 = -8 - 16 - 10 + 10 = -24\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) + 10 = 1 - 4 + 5 + 10 = 12\nf(5/3) = (5/3)^3 - 4(5/3)^2 + 5(5/3) + 10 ≈ 15.185\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 4(5)^2 + 5(5) + 10 = 125 - 100 + 25 + 10 = 60\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find that the maximum possible value of the function is f(5) = 60."
