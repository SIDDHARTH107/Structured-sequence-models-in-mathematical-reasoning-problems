    "message_1": "A water tank has a rectangular shape with a length of 3 meters, a width of 2 meters, and a height of 2 meters. Water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 0.5 cubic meters per minute. At what rate is the water level in the tank rising when the depth of the water is 1 meter? (Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.)",
    "message_2": "To find the rate at which the water level is rising, we can use the formula:\n\nRate of water level rise = (Rate of water being pumped in) / (Area of the base of the tank)\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base of the tank. Since the tank has a rectangular shape, the area of the base can be found by multiplying the length and the width:\n\nArea of the base = Length × Width\nArea of the base = 3 meters × 2 meters\nArea of the base = 6 square meters\n\nNow, we can find the rate at which the water level is rising:\n\nRate of water level rise = (Rate of water being pumped in) / (Area of the base of the tank)\nRate of water level rise = (0.5 cubic meters per minute) / (6 square meters)\nRate of water level rise = 0.5 / 6\nRate of water level rise ≈ 0.0833 meters per minute\n\nSo, when the depth of the water is 1 meter, the water level is rising at a rate of approximately 0.08 meters per minute (rounded to the nearest hundredth)."
