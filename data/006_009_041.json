    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, having the medical condition) in n trials (sample size)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n- p is the probability of success (having the medical condition) in a single trial\n- n is the sample size (number of individuals)\n- k is the number of successes (individuals with the medical condition)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 250 (sample size)\n- k = 15 (number of individuals with the medical condition)\n- p = 0.06 (probability of having the medical condition)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk (250 choose 15):\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\nnCk = 250! / (15!(250-15)!)\nnCk = 250! / (15! * 235!)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorials and the division, we get:\n\nnCk ≈ 3,315,315,063\n\nNow, let's calculate the other parts of the formula:\n\np^k = 0.06^15 ≈ 6.0466176e-12\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.06)^(250-15) = 0.94^235 ≈ 1.196428e-10\n\nFinally, let's plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 15) = nCk * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\nP(X = 15) ≈ 3,315,315,063 * 6.0466176e-12 * 1.196428e-10\n\nP(X = 15) ≈ 0.024998\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 15 of the 250 individuals in the random sample have the medical condition is approximately 0.024998 or 2.4998%."
