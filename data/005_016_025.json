Discriminant analysis is used to determine a boundary that maximizes the separation between students who receive the scholarship and those who do not. \n\nAssuming that there are only two groups, a student developer an equation for discriminant analysis that separates the two groups, given the following data: \n\nGroup 1 (scholarship): \n- Mean high school GPA: 3.8 \n- Mean entrance exam score: 95. \n- Variance-covariance matrix: \n    - High school GPA variance = 0.21 \n    - Entrance exam score variance = 34. \n    - Covariance = 0.91 \n\nGroup 2 (no scholarship): \n- Mean high school GPA: 2.9\n- Mean entrance exam score: 77. \n- Variance-covariance matrix: \n    - High school GPA variance = 0.27 \n    - Entrance exam score variance = 28. \n    - Covariance = 1.26 \n\nWhat is the discriminant equation for this problem?",
    "message_2": "To find the discriminant equation, we will use the following formula:\n\nD(x) = W^(-1) * (µ1 - µ2)\n\nwhere D(x) is the discriminant function, W^(-1) is the inverse of the pooled within-group covariance matrix, and µ1 and µ2 are the mean vectors of the two groups.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the pooled within-group covariance matrix W:\n\nW = [(n1 - 1) * S1 + (n2 - 1) * S2] / (n1 + n2 - 2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the number of observations in each group, and S1 and S2 are the covariance matrices for each group.\n\nSince we don't have the number of observations, we can assume that the groups have equal sizes and the pooled within-group covariance matrix W will be the average of the two covariance matrices:\n\nW = (S1 + S2) / 2\n\nS1 = | 0.21  0.91 |\n     | 0.91  34   |\n\nS2 = | 0.27  1.26 |\n     | 1.26  28   |\n\nW = | (0.21 + 0.27) / 2  (0.91 + 1.26) / 2 |\n     | (0.91 + 1.26) / 2  (34 + 28) / 2    |\n\nW = | 0.24  1.085 |\n     | 1.085 31    |\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of W:\n\nW^(-1) = 1 / det(W) * adj(W)\n\nwhere det(W) is the determinant of W and adj(W) is the adjugate of W.\n\ndet(W) = 0.24 * 31 - 1.085 * 1.085 = 7.44 - 1.177225 = 6.262775\n\nadj(W) = |  31   -1.085 |\n         | -1.085  0.24  |\n\nW^(-1) = 1 / 6.262775 * |  31   -1.085 |\n                        | -1.085  0.24  |\n\nW^(-1) = |  4.9504  0.1733 |\n         |  0.1733  0.0383 |\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the mean vectors:\n\nµ1 - µ2 = | 3.8 - 2.9 | = | 0.9  |\n          |  95 - 77  |   | 18   |\n\nFinally, let's calculate the discriminant function D(x):\n\nD(x) = W^(-1) * (µ1 - µ2)\n\nD(x) = |  4.9504  0.1733 | * | 0.9  |\n       |  0.1733  0.0383 |   | 18   |\n\nD(x) = | 4.9504 * 0.9 + 0.1733 * 18 |\n       | 0.1733 * 0.9 + 0.0383 * 18  |\n\nD(x) = | 4.45536 + 3.1194 |\n       | 0.15597 + 0.6882 |\n\nD(x) = | 7.57476 |\n       | 0.84417 |\n\nSo, the discriminant equation is:\n\nD(x) = 7.57476 * GPA + 0.84417 * ExamScore"
