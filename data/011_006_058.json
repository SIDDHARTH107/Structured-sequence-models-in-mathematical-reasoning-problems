    "message_1": "A student is collecting stamps for his collection. He has 4 different types of stamps and wants to know how many different collections he can make if he wants to have a total of 8 stamps in each collection. \n\nWhat is the number of possible collections the student can make?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the stars and bars method. We have 8 stamps (stars) and 3 dividers (bars) to separate the 4 types of stamps. The total number of objects (stars and bars) is 8 + 3 = 11. We need to choose 3 positions for the dividers among the 11 positions.\n\nThe number of possible collections is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 11 and k = 3:\n\nC(11, 3) = 11! / (3!(11-3)!) = 11! / (3!8!) = 165\n\nSo, the student can make 165 different collections with a total of 8 stamps."
