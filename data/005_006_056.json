    "message_1": "A factory packages bags of potato chips with a mean weight of 280 grams and a standard deviation of 15 grams. If a sample of 100 bags is taken, what is the probability that the average weight of the bags is less than 275 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. In this case, we have a sample size of 100 bags, which is large enough to apply the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean. The formula for this is:\n\nStandard deviation of the sample mean = (Standard deviation of the population) / sqrt(sample size)\n\nIn our case, the standard deviation of the population is 15 grams, and the sample size is 100 bags. So, the standard deviation of the sample mean is:\n\nStandard deviation of the sample mean = 15 / sqrt(100) = 15 / 10 = 1.5 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the given average weight of 275 grams. The z-score is the number of standard deviations away from the mean. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nZ-score = (Sample mean - Population mean) / Standard deviation of the sample mean\n\nIn our case, the sample mean is 275 grams, the population mean is 280 grams, and the standard deviation of the sample mean is 1.5 grams. So, the z-score is:\n\nZ-score = (275 - 280) / 1.5 = -5 / 1.5 = -3.33\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -3.33. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area to the left of the z-score, which represents the probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score less than -3.33 is approximately 0.0004 or 0.04%.\n\nSo, there is a 0.04% probability that the average weight of the 100 bags of potato chips is less than 275 grams."
