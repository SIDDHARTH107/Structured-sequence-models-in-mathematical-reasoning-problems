    "message_2": "To prove the statement using natural deduction, we'll first define even and odd integers, and then use these definitions to show that the sum of an even and an odd integer is an odd integer.\n\nDefinitions:\n1. An integer x is even if there exists an integer k such that x = 2k.\n2. An integer y is odd if there exists an integer m such that y = 2m + 1.\n\nProof:\n1. Assume x is an even integer.\n   By definition, there exists an integer k such that x = 2k.\n\n2. Assume y is an odd integer.\n   By definition, there exists an integer m such that y = 2m + 1.\n\n3. Now, we want to show that x + y is an odd integer.\n   x + y = (2k) + (2m + 1) [by substitution from steps 1 and 2]\n\n4. x + y = 2(k + m) + 1 [by factoring out 2]\n\n5. Let n = k + m, where n is an integer (since k and m are integers).\n\n6. x + y = 2n + 1 [by substitution from step 5]\n\n7. By definition, x + y is an odd integer (since there exists an integer n such that x + y = 2n + 1).\n\nTherefore, if x is an even integer and y is an odd integer, then x + y is an odd integer."
