At the moment when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall? (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder has a length of 10 feet. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nWe are given that dx/dt = 2 ft/sec (the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall). We want to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 6 feet.\n\nTo find dy/dt, we will differentiate the equation with respect to time (t):\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\n24 + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWhen x = 6, we can find the value of y using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of y into the equation:\n\n24 + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n\n16(dy/dt) = -24\n\ndy/dt = -24/16\ndy/dt = -1.5\n\nSo, at the moment when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 1.5 ft/sec (rounded to two decimal places)."
