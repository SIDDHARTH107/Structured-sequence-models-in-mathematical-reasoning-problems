    "message_1": "In how many ways can you arrange 5 different books into 3 indistinguishable boxes if each box must contain at least one book?",
    "message_2": "Since each box must contain at least one book, we can consider the following possible distributions of books among the 3 indistinguishable boxes:\n\n1. Distribution (3, 1, 1): One box contains 3 books, and the other two boxes contain 1 book each.\n2. Distribution (2, 2, 1): Two boxes contain 2 books each, and the third box contains 1 book.\n3. Distribution (2, 1, 1): One box contains 2 books, and the other two boxes contain 1 book each. This case is not valid because it is indistinguishable from case 1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of arrangements for each distribution:\n\n1. Distribution (3, 1, 1): We need to choose 3 books out of 5 to put in the first box. This can be done in C(5,3) ways. The remaining 2 books will be placed in the other two boxes, one in each. So, there are C(5,3) = 10 ways for this distribution.\n\n2. Distribution (2, 2, 1): We need to choose 2 books out of 5 to put in the first box, which can be done in C(5,2) ways. Then, we need to choose 2 books out of the remaining 3 to put in the second box, which can be done in C(3,2) ways. The last book will be placed in the third box. So, there are C(5,2) * C(3,2) = 10 * 3 = 30 ways for this distribution. However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we have overcounted the arrangements by a factor of 2 (swapping the first two boxes doesn't change the arrangement). So, we need to divide the result by 2, which gives us 30 / 2 = 15 ways for this distribution.\n\nAdding the number of arrangements for both distributions, we get 10 + 15 = 25 ways to arrange the 5 different books into 3 indistinguishable boxes, with each box containing at least one book."
