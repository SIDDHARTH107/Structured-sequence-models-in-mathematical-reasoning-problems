    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we first need to discretize the spatial domain and approximate the solution u(x,t) by a linear combination of basis functions. Let's use N equally spaced nodes in the interval [0, π] and denote the basis functions by φ_i(x), i = 1, 2, ..., N.\n\nThe approximate solution can be written as:\n\nu(x,t) ≈ ∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)]\n\nwhere U_i(t) are the time-dependent coefficients.\n\nNow, we need to derive the weak form of the PDE. Multiply the PDE by a test function v(x) and integrate over the spatial domain:\n\n∫[∂u/∂t * v(x) - ∂²u/∂x² * v(x)] dx = ∫[cos(x) * v(x)] dx\n\nSubstitute the approximate solution into the weak form:\n\n∫[∂(∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)])/∂t * v(x) - ∂²(∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)])/∂x² * v(x)] dx = ∫[cos(x) * v(x)] dx\n\nApply integration by parts to the second term:\n\n∫[∑[U_i'(t) * φ_i(x) * v(x)] dx + ∫[∑[U_i(t) * φ_i''(x) * v(x)] dx = ∫[cos(x) * v(x)] dx\n\nNow, we can use the Galerkin method, which sets the test functions equal to the basis functions: v(x) = φ_j(x), j = 1, 2, ..., N. This results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the coefficients U_i(t):\n\n∑[U_i'(t) * ∫[φ_i(x) * φ_j(x)] dx] + ∑[U_i(t) * ∫[φ_i''(x) * φ_j(x)] dx] = ∫[cos(x) * φ_j(x)] dx, for j = 1, 2, ..., N\n\nNow, we can use a numerical method, such as the backward Euler method, to solve the system of ODEs for U_i(t) at each time step. The initial condition is given by:\n\nu(x,0) = x(π - x) ≈ ∑[U_i(0) * φ_i(x)]\n\nTo find the numerical solution for u(x,t) at x = π/4 and t = T/2, we first need to solve the system of ODEs for U_i(t) at t = T/2 using the FEM and a suitable time-stepping method. Then, we can evaluate the approximate solution at x = π/4:\n\nu(π/4, T/2) ≈ ∑[U_i(T/2) * φ_i(π/4)]\n\nThis will give us the numerical solution for u(x,t) at the desired point. Note that the accuracy of the solution depends on the number of nodes N and the time step size used in the time-stepping method."
