    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a polynomial function, we will use Liouville's theorem, which states that every bounded entire function must be constant. We will show that the derivative of f(z) is bounded, which implies that f'(z) is a constant function, and thus f(z) is a polynomial function.\n\nConsider the function g(z) = f'(z). Since f(z) is entire, g(z) is also entire. Now, let's find an upper bound for |g(z)|.\n\nUsing the Cauchy's integral formula for the derivative, we have:\n\ng(z) = f'(z) = (1/(2πi)) ∮(f(ζ)/(ζ-z)^2) dζ\n\nTaking the absolute value of both sides, we get:\n\n|g(z)| = |(1/(2πi))| |∮(f(ζ)/(ζ-z)^2) dζ|\n\nNow, we know that |f(ζ)| ≤ 3|ζ|^2 + 2. Therefore,\n\n|g(z)| ≤ (1/(2π)) ∮(|(3|ζ|^2 + 2)/(|ζ-z|^2)|) |dζ|\n\nLet's consider a circle with center z and radius R. When |ζ-z| = R, we have:\n\n|g(z)| ≤ (1/(2π)) ∮((3|R|^2 + 2)/R^2) |dζ|\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\n|g(z)| ≤ (1/(2π)) (3 + 2/R^2) ∮|dζ|\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\n|g(z)| ≤ (1/(2π)) (3 + 2/R^2) (2πR)\n\nAs R → ∞, the term 2/R^2 goes to 0, and we have:\n\n|g(z)| ≤ 3R\n\nSince |g(z)| is bounded, by Liouville's theorem, g(z) = f'(z) must be a constant function. Therefore, f(z) is a polynomial function.\n\nBonus question:\n\nTo prove that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root, we will use the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root.\n\nLet p(z) be a non-constant polynomial of degree n with complex coefficients. We can write p(z) as:\n\np(z) = a_nz^n + a_(n-1)z^(n-1) + ... + a_1z + a_0\n\nwhere a_n ≠ 0.\n\nNow, consider the function:\n\ng(z) = p(z)/z^n\n\nAs z → ∞, g(z) → a_n, which is a nonzero complex number. Therefore, there exists a complex number R such that |g(z) - a_n| < |a_n|/2 for all |z| > R.\n\nNow, let's consider a circle with center 0 and radius R. On this circle, we have:\n\n|g(z) - a_n| < |a_n|/2\n\nwhich implies that g(z) ≠ 0 for all |z| = R.\n\nSince g(z) is continuous and nonzero on the circle, by the argument principle, the number of zeros of g(z) inside the circle is equal to the winding number of g(z) around 0, which is an integer. Since g(0) = a_0/z^n, we have a zero of g(z) at z = 0 with multiplicity n. Therefore, the number of zeros of g(z) inside the circle is at least n.\n\nNow, since p(z) = z^n * g(z), the zeros of p(z) are the zeros of g(z) and z^n. Since z^n has n distinct complex roots, and g(z) has at least n zeros inside the circle, p(z) has at least n complex roots. Therefore, every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root."
