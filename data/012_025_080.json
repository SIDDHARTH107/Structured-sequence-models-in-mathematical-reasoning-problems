    "message_2": "To determine if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in an undirected graph with 8 vertices, we need more information about the graph, such as the adjacency matrix or a list of edges. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n\nPlease provide more information about the graph, and then I can help you find a Hamiltonian cycle if it exists."
