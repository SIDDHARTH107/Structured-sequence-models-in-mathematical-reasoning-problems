    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set has an area of approximately 1.50659177 square units. When you zoom in on the Mandelbrot set, the area of the main cardioid does not change, as it is a fractal. Fractals have the property of self-similarity, meaning that their structure remains the same at different scales.\n\nSo, even when the Mandelbrot set is zoomed in 10 times, the area of the main cardioid remains approximately 1.50659177 square units."
