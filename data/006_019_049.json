    "message_1": "What is the probability that a randomly selected voter from a population of 10 million registered voters in a country belongs to a political party given that 60% of the population belongs to one of the two major political parties in the country?",
    "message_2": "The probability that a randomly selected voter belongs to a political party, given that 60% of the population belongs to one of the two major political parties, is simply 60% or 0.6. This is because the probability of an event occurring is equal to the proportion of the population for which the event is true. In this case, since 60% of the population belongs to a political party, the probability of selecting a voter who belongs to a political party is also 60%."
