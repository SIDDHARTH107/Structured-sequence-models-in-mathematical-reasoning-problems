Both results should be the same.\n\nGiven the prime number p = 17, primitive root g = 3, Alice's private key a = 4, and Bob's private key b = 11:\n\n1. Alice's public key (A): A = (3^4) mod 17 = 81 mod 17 = 13\n2. Bob's public key (B): B = (3^11) mod 17 = 177147 mod 17 = 9\n3. Shared secret key: \n   - Alice computes (9^4) mod 17 = 6561 mod 17 = 3\n   - Bob computes (13^11) mod 17 = 17921603940313 mod 17 = 3\n\nThe shared secret key is 3."
