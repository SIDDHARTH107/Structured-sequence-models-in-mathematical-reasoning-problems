    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing the middle square from each face of a cube. In the first iteration, we remove the middle square from each of the 6 faces of the original cube. Each removed square has a side length of 1 cm (since the original cube has a side length of 3 cm) and a depth of 1 cm. \n\nThere are 6 faces, so we remove 6 squares in total. The volume of each removed square is 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm³. Therefore, the total volume removed in the first iteration is 6 × 1 cm³ = 6 cm³.\n\nThe original cube has a volume of 3 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm = 27 cm³. After removing the middle squares, the remaining volume of the Menger sponge is:\n\n27 cm³ - 6 cm³ = 21 cm³."
