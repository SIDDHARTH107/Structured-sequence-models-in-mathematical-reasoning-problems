    "message_2": "To find the analytic function f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), we first need to express z^2 + i in terms of x and y, where z = x + iy.\n\nf(z) = (x + iy)^2 + i\nf(z) = (x^2 + 2ixy - y^2) + i\n\nNow, we separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nu(x, y) = x^2 - y^2\nv(x, y) = 2xy + 1\n\nSo, f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = (x^2 - y^2) + i(2xy + 1).\n\nNow, we need to check if f(z) is differentiable with respect to z. For a function to be differentiable (analytic), it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x\n∂u/∂y = -2y\n∂v/∂x = 2y\n∂v/∂y = 2x\n\nNow, let's check if the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y => 2x = 2x (True)\n∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x => -2y = -2y (True)\n\nSince the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied, f(z) = (x^2 - y^2) + i(2xy + 1) is an analytic function."
