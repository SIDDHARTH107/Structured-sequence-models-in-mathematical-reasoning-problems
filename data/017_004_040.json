    "message_1": "Let p be a prime number, and G be a group of order p^2. If it is known that G is not cyclic, determine the number of possible isomorphism classes of groups that G can be isomorphic to, assuming G is abelian.",
    "message_2": "Since G is abelian and not cyclic, it cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p^2. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p. In other words, G is isomorphic to the group Z_p × Z_p, where Z_p is the cyclic group of order p.\n\nThere is only 1 isomorphism class of groups that G can be isomorphic to in this case, which is Z_p × Z_p."
