Calculate the maximum amount of money Sophia can earn if she tutors for no more than 8 hours per week.",
    "message_2": "To graph the inequality y < 15x - 60, we first need to find the boundary line, which is y = 15x - 60. We can find some points on this line by plugging in values for x:\n\nWhen x = 0:\ny = 15(0) - 60\ny = -60\nSo, the point (0, -60) is on the line.\n\nWhen x = 4:\ny = 15(4) - 60\ny = 60 - 60\ny = 0\nSo, the point (4, 0) is on the line.\n\nWhen x = 8:\ny = 15(8) - 60\ny = 120 - 60\ny = 60\nSo, the point (8, 60) is on the line.\n\nNow, we can plot these points on the coordinate plane and draw the line y = 15x - 60. Since the inequality is y < 15x - 60, we will shade the region below the line.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum amount of money Sophia can earn if she tutors for no more than 8 hours per week. Since the inequality is y < 15x - 60, we can find the maximum amount of money she can earn by plugging in x = 8:\n\ny = 15(8) - 60\ny = 120 - 60\ny = 60\n\nSo, the maximum amount of money Sophia can earn if she tutors for no more than 8 hours per week is $60 per hour."
