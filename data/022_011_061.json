    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole at $z=0$, we first need to factor out the common factor of $z$ in the denominator:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z(z^2 - z + 2)}$$\n\nNow, we can see that there is a simple pole at $z=0$ since the denominator has a single factor of $z$. Therefore, the order of the pole at $z=0$ is 1.\n\nTo find the residue, we can use the formula for residues of simple poles:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 0) = \\lim_{z \\to 0} (z - 0) f(z) = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{z}{z^2 - z + 2}$$\n\nSince the limit is of the form $\\frac{0}{0}$, we can use L'Hopital's rule:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{z}{z^2 - z + 2} = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{1}{2z - 1}$$\n\nEvaluating the limit as $z$ approaches $0$, we get:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 0) = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1$$\n\nSo, the order of the pole at $z=0$ is 1, and the residue is -1."
