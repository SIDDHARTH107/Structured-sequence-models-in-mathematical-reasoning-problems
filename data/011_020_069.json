    "message_1": "A company is planning to send a team of 5 employees to attend a conference. However, they have 7 employees who wish to attend the conference. In how many different ways can the company choose a team of 5 employees to attend the conference?",
    "message_2": "This is a combination problem, as the order of the employees chosen does not matter. We can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (7 in this case) and k is the number of employees to be chosen (5 in this case).\n\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5!(7-5)!)\n\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5!2!)\n\nC(7, 5) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)(2 * 1))\n\nC(7, 5) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n\nC(7, 5) = 42\n\nSo, there are 42 different ways the company can choose a team of 5 employees to attend the conference."
