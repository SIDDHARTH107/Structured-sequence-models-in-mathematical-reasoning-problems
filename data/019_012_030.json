    "message_2": "In paraconsistent logic, the statement \"P and ~P\" is considered to be a contradiction. Paraconsistent logic allows for contradictions to exist without leading to an explosion of truth values, meaning that not everything becomes true as a result of a contradiction. \n\nHowever, the truth value of \"P and ~P\" in paraconsistent logic is still considered to be false, as it represents a contradictory statement. The main difference between classical logic and paraconsistent logic is how they handle the consequences of contradictions, not the truth value of the contradictions themselves."
