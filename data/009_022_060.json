Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve based on the topic \"Reaction-diffusion equations for pattern formation\":\n\nGiven two chemicals A and B that react and diffuse together, a simple model for the reaction-diffusion system is given by the following equations:\n\n∂A/∂t = D_a ∇²A - kA + f(A,B)\n∂B/∂t = D_b ∇²B + kA - g(B)\n\nWhere D_a and D_b are the diffusion coefficients, k is the reaction rate, f(A,B) and g(B) are the terms representing the reaction between A and B. A and B are the concentrations of the chemicals.\n\nSuppose we consider a 2-dimensional rectangular region with side length of 1m and homogeneous boundary conditions. Starting with the initial conditions A(x,y,0) = 0.5e^(-100((x - 0.3)^2 + (y - 0.4)^2)) and B(x,y,0) = 0.5e^(-100((x - 0.7)^2 + (y - 0.6)^2)), where (x,y) are the coordinates in the rectangle, solve the reaction-diffusion equations numerically using a finite difference method with time step delta_t = 0.002s, for a time duration of 10s. Then, plot the concentration profile (A(x,y,10), B(x,y,10)) using MATLAB or any other suitable tool.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem numerically, we'll use the finite difference method. We'll discretize the spatial domain using a grid with a step size of delta_x and delta_y, and the time domain using a step size of delta_t. We'll use the central difference approximation for the Laplacian operator and the forward Euler method for time integration.\n\nHere's a Python code using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to solve the problem and plot the concentration profiles:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Parameters\nD_a = 1\nD_b = 1\nk = 1\nf = lambda A, B: A * B**2\ng = lambda B: B\n\n# Discretization\ndelta_t = 0.002\ndelta_x = 0.01\ndelta_y = 0.01\nT = 10\nNx = int(1 / delta_x) + 1\nNy = int(1 / delta_y) + 1\nNt = int(T / delta_t) + 1\n\n# Initial conditions\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, Nx)\ny = np.linspace(0, 1, Ny)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\nA = 0.5 * np.exp(-100 * ((X - 0.3)**2 + (Y - 0.4)**2))\nB = 0.5 * np.exp(-100 * ((X - 0.7)**2 + (Y - 0.6)**2))\n\n# Time integration\nfor t in range(Nt):\n    A_new = A + delta_t * (D_a * (np.roll(A, 1, axis=0) - 2 * A + np.roll(A, -1, axis=0)) / delta_x**2\n                          + D_a * (np.roll(A, 1, axis=1) - 2 * A + np.roll(A, -1, axis=1)) / delta_y**2\n                          - k * A + f(A, B))\n    B_new = B + delta_t * (D_b * (np.roll(B, 1, axis=0) - 2 * B + np.roll(B, -1, axis=0)) / delta_x**2\n                          + D_b * (np.roll(B, 1, axis=1) - 2 * B + np.roll(B, -1, axis=1)) / delta_y**2\n                          + k * A - g(B))\n    A, B = A_new, B_new\n\n# Plot concentration profiles\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))\nc1 = ax1.pcolormesh(X, Y, A, cmap='viridis', shading='auto')\nax1.set_title('A(x,y,10)')\nfig.colorbar(c1, ax=ax1)\n\nc2 = ax2.pcolormesh(X, Y, B, cmap='viridis', shading='auto')\nax2.set_title('B(x,y,10)')\nfig.colorbar(c2, ax=ax2)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will generate the concentration profiles of A(x,y,10) and B(x,y,10) after 10 seconds. Note that the parameters D_a, D_b, and k, as well as the functions f(A,B) and g(B), should be specified according to the specific problem."
