    "message_2": "To satisfy the formula $\\varphi = \\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box q$, we need to ensure that if $p$ is always true, then $q$ must also always be true. Since $p$ is true in states $s_1, s_2, s_3$, and $q$ is true in states $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4$, we can construct a Kripke structure with these states to satisfy the formula.\n\nWe can create a Kripke structure with 4 states, where:\n\n1. $s_1$ has transitions to $s_2$ and $s_4$.\n2. $s_2$ has a transition to $s_3$.\n3. $s_3$ has a transition to $s_1$.\n4. $s_4$ has a transition to itself.\n\nIn this Kripke structure, $p$ is true in states $s_1, s_2, s_3$, and $q$ is true in states $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4$. The formula $\\varphi = \\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box q$ is satisfied because whenever $p$ is true, $q$ is also true.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of states in the Kripke structure to satisfy $\\varphi$ is 4."
