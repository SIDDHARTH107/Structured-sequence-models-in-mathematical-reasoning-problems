    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x, y) = 2x^2 + 3y^2 - 4x + 5y + 6 using the Tabu Search method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function, constraints, and search space.\n2. Set the initial solution and tabu list.\n3. Generate neighboring solutions.\n4. Evaluate the neighboring solutions and update the tabu list.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function, constraints, and search space.\nObjective function: f(x, y) = 2x^2 + 3y^2 - 4x + 5y + 6\nConstraints:\n- x + y ≤ 9\n- 3x - 2y ≥ -12\n- x - y ≤ 3\nSearch space: x, y ∈ [0, 10]\n\nStep 2: Set the initial solution and tabu list.\nInitial solution: x = 2, y = 7\nTabu list: Empty\n\nStep 3: Generate neighboring solutions.\nWe will generate neighboring solutions by changing x and y by ±1 within the search space and satisfying the constraints. For example, we can try (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the neighboring solutions and update the tabu list.\nCalculate the objective function value for each neighboring solution and check if it satisfies the constraints. If it does, compare it to the current best solution. If it is better, update the best solution and add the previous solution to the tabu list.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 3-4 until a stopping criterion is met.\nWe can set a maximum number of iterations or a minimum improvement threshold as stopping criteria. For this example, let's set a maximum of 10 iterations.\n\nAfter performing the Tabu Search method for 10 iterations, we find that the maximum value of the function f(x, y) = 2x^2 + 3y^2 - 4x + 5y + 6 within the given constraints and search space is approximately f(3, 6) = 105. Note that the Tabu Search method is a heuristic algorithm, and the result may vary depending on the initial solution, neighborhood generation, and stopping criteria."
