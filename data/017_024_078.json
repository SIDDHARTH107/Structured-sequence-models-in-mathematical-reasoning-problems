    "message_1": "What are the possible number of non-abelian groups of order 96 that exist? Provide a list of these groups and their respective isomorphism classes.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find the prime factorization of 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Now, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is given by:\n\nn(G) = (p^(k-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(l-1) * (q-1))\n\nwhere n(G) is the number of groups of order G, p and q are distinct prime factors of G, and k and l are the highest powers of p and q in the prime factorization of G, respectively.\n\nIn our case, p = 2, k = 5, q = 3, and l = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nn(G) = (2^(5-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1))\nn(G) = (2^4 * 1) * (3^0 * 2)\nn(G) = (16) * (1 * 2)\nn(G) = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 groups of order 96. However, this includes both abelian and non-abelian groups. To find the number of non-abelian groups, we need to subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups.\n\nThe number of abelian groups of order 96 can be found using the formula:\n\nn(A) = product of (p_i^(k_i - 1) * (p_i - 1))\n\nwhere n(A) is the number of abelian groups of order G, and p_i and k_i are the prime factors and their respective powers in the prime factorization of G.\n\nIn our case, the number of abelian groups of order 96 is:\n\nn(A) = (2^(5-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1))\nn(A) = (2^4 * 1) * (3^0 * 2)\nn(A) = (16) * (1 * 2)\nn(A) = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 abelian groups of order 96. Subtracting this from the total number of groups, we get:\n\nn(NA) = n(G) - n(A)\nn(NA) = 32 - 4\nn(NA) = 28\n\nThus, there are 28 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nNow, listing all 28 non-abelian groups and their respective isomorphism classes is a complex task and beyond the scope of a simple answer. However, some examples of non-abelian groups of order 96 include:\n\n1. The semidirect product of Z_2^4 and Z_3 (Z_2^4 ⋊ Z_3)\n2. The semidirect product of Z_2^3 and Z_6 (Z_2^3 ⋊ Z_6)\n3. The semidirect product of Z_2^2 and Z_24 (Z_2^2 ⋊ Z_24)\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many more non-abelian groups of order 96 with different isomorphism classes."
