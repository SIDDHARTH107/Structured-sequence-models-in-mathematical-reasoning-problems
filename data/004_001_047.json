The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, 3x^4:\nThe derivative is 4 * 3x^(4-1) = 12x^3.\n\nFor the second term, 2x^3:\nThe derivative is 3 * 2x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n\nFor the third term, -6x^2:\nThe derivative is 2 * (-6)x^(2-1) = -12x.\n\nFor the fourth term, 5:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we add up the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 0\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 5 is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x"
