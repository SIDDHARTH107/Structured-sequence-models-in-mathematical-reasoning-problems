    "message_2": "a) To construct a time series plot, you would plot the number of visitors on the y-axis and the months on the x-axis. Here's a description of the plot:\n\n- January: 1200 visitors\n- February: 1500 visitors\n- March: 2100 visitors\n- April: 1800 visitors\n- May: 2400 visitors\n- June: 2700 visitors\n\nThe plot would show an overall increasing trend in the number of visitors over the six-month period.\n\nb) To calculate the 3-month moving average for each month, we will average the number of visitors for each month and the two months preceding it. For the first two months, there is not enough data to calculate a 3-month moving average.\n\n- January: N/A\n- February: N/A\n- March: (1200 + 1500 + 2100) / 3 = 4800 / 3 = 1600\n- April: (1500 + 2100 + 1800) / 3 = 5400 / 3 = 1800\n- May: (2100 + 1800 + 2400) / 3 = 6300 / 3 = 2100\n- June: (1800 + 2400 + 2700) / 3 = 6900 / 3 = 2300\n\nc) To use exponential smoothing with alpha = 0.3 to forecast the number of visitors for July, we will apply the following formula:\n\nForecast for July = (Actual value for June * alpha) + (Forecast for June * (1 - alpha))\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the forecast for June. We will use the actual value for May and the forecast for May in the formula:\n\nForecast for June = (Actual value for May * alpha) + (Forecast for May * (1 - alpha))\nForecast for June = (2400 * 0.3) + (2100 * 0.7) = 720 + 1470 = 2190\n\nNow, we can calculate the forecast for July:\n\nForecast for July = (Actual value for June * alpha) + (Forecast for June * (1 - alpha))\nForecast for July = (2700 * 0.3) + (2190 * 0.7) = 810 + 1533 = 2343\n\nSo, the forecast for the number of visitors in July is 2343 visitors."
