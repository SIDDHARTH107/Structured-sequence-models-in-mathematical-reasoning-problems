    "message_1": "A square piece of cardboard has a length of 10 cm. The cardboard is to be cut into four congruent squares with the largest possible area. What is the length of each of the smaller squares?",
    "message_2": "To cut the square cardboard into four congruent squares with the largest possible area, we need to divide the cardboard into four equal parts. Since the cardboard is a square with a length of 10 cm, its area is 10 cm * 10 cm = 100 square cm.\n\nNow, divide the total area by 4 to find the area of each smaller square: 100 square cm / 4 = 25 square cm.\n\nSince the smaller squares are also squares, we can find the length of their sides by taking the square root of their area: âˆš25 = 5 cm.\n\nSo, the length of each of the smaller squares is 5 cm."
