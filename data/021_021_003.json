    "message_1": "Airlines company X wants to minimize the cost of their flight routes. The company has a total of 10 flight routes that they want to optimize. They have determined that the cost function for each route is given by:\n\nC(x) = 500 + 2x^2 - 3x\n\nwhere x is the number of passengers on that route. Implement the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal number of passengers for each route that minimizes the total cost of all routes combined. The maximum number of passengers allowed on each route is 300.",
    "message_2": "To implement the cuckoo search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of cuckoo nests (solutions) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution).\n3. Perform a Levy flight to generate a new solution.\n4. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n5. Replace the worst solution with the new solution if it is better.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nHere's the implementation of the cuckoo search algorithm for the given problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\n# Cost function\ndef C(x):\n    return 500 + 2 * x**2 - 3 * x\n\n# Fitness function (total cost for all routes)\ndef fitness(solution):\n    return np.sum([C(x) for x in solution])\n\n# Levy flight\ndef levy_flight(beta, size):\n    sigma_u = (np.gamma(1 + beta) * np.sin(np.pi * beta / 2) / (np.gamma((1 + beta) / 2) * beta * 2**((beta - 1) / 2)))**(1 / beta)\n    u = np.random.normal(0, sigma_u, size)\n    v = np.random.normal(0, 1, size)\n    step = u / np.abs(v)**(1 / beta)\n    return step\n\n# Cuckoo search algorithm\ndef cuckoo_search(n_nests, max_iter, beta, p_replace):\n    # Initialize nests\n    nests = np.random.randint(0, 301, (n_nests, 10))\n    \n    # Evaluate fitness of nests\n    nest_fitness = np.array([fitness(nest) for nest in nests])\n    \n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        # Choose a nest randomly\n        i = random.randint(0, n_nests - 1)\n        nest = nests[i]\n        \n        # Generate a new solution using Levy flight\n        new_nest = nest + levy_flight(beta, 10)\n        new_nest = np.clip(new_nest, 0, 300).astype(int)\n        \n        # Evaluate the fitness of the new solution\n        new_fitness = fitness(new_nest)\n        \n        # Replace the nest with the new solution if it is better\n        if new_fitness < nest_fitness[i]:\n            nests[i] = new_nest\n            nest_fitness[i] = new_fitness\n        \n        # Replace a fraction of the worst nests with new solutions\n        n_replace = int(n_nests * p_replace)\n        worst_nests = np.argsort(nest_fitness)[-n_replace:]\n        for i in worst_nests:\n            new_nest = nests[i] + levy_flight(beta, 10)\n            new_nest = np.clip(new_nest, 0, 300).astype(int)\n            new_fitness = fitness(new_nest)\n            \n            if new_fitness < nest_fitness[i]:\n                nests[i] = new_nest\n                nest_fitness[i] = new_fitness\n    \n    # Return the best solution\n    best_nest = nests[np.argmin(nest_fitness)]\n    return best_nest\n\n# Parameters\nn_nests = 50\nmax_iter = 1000\nbeta = 1.5\np_replace = 0.25\n\n# Run the cuckoo search algorithm\nbest_solution = cuckoo_search(n_nests, max_iter, beta, p_replace)\nprint(\"Optimal number of passengers for each route:\", best_solution)\nprint(\"Minimum total cost:\", fitness(best_solution))\n```\n\nThis code will output the optimal number of passengers for each route and the minimum total cost. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. You can adjust the parameters (number of nests, maximum iterations, beta, and replacement probability) to fine-tune the performance of the algorithm."
