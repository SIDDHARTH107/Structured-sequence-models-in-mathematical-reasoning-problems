    "message_1": "Consider a graph G which has 10 vertices and 20 edges. Determine the chromatic number of G if every vertex has degree greater than or equal to 3.",
    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of G, we can use the following inequality:\n\nχ(G) ≥ (Δ(G) + 1) / 2\n\nwhere χ(G) is the chromatic number of G, and Δ(G) is the maximum degree of G.\n\nSince every vertex in G has a degree greater than or equal to 3, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least 3 * 10 = 30. However, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is also equal to twice the number of edges, which is 2 * 20 = 40. Therefore, the maximum degree of G is at least 4.\n\nUsing the inequality, we get:\n\nχ(G) ≥ (4 + 1) / 2 = 2.5\n\nSince the chromatic number must be an integer, we can round up to get χ(G) ≥ 3.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a 3-coloring for G. Since G has 20 edges, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher. Without loss of generality, let's assume that vertex A has a degree of 4. Then, there are 4 other vertices connected to A. We can color A with color 1, and its 4 neighbors with colors 2 and 3 (alternating between the two colors).\n\nNow, we have 5 remaining vertices. Since each of these vertices has a degree of at least 3, they must be connected to at least one of the 4 neighbors of A. If any of these 5 vertices is connected to two neighbors of A with different colors, we can color that vertex with the remaining color. If any of these 5 vertices is connected to two neighbors of A with the same color, we can color that vertex with the other color. In either case, we can find a 3-coloring for G.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of G is 3."
