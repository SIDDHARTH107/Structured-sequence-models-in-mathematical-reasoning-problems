    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x + 5) - log(x - 2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\n1. Combine the logarithms using the quotient rule: log((x + 5)/(x - 2)) = 2\nThe quotient rule states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b).\n\n2. Remove the logarithm by using exponentiation: (x + 5)/(x - 2) = 10^2\nSince log(a) = b is equivalent to a = 10^b, we can rewrite the equation as (x + 5)/(x - 2) = 100.\n\n3. Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by (x - 2): x + 5 = 100(x - 2)\n\n4. Distribute the 100 on the right side: x + 5 = 100x - 200\n\n5. Move all terms to one side: 99x = 205\n\n6. Divide by 99: x = 205/99\n\nSo, the solution is x = 205/99."
