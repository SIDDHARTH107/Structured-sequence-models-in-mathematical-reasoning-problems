    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, width of 4 cm, and height of 7 cm. Determine the surface area of the rectangular prism.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of the front and back faces (length x height): 5 cm x 7 cm = 35 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 35 cm² x 2 = 70 cm².\n\n2. The area of the left and right faces (width x height): 4 cm x 7 cm = 28 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 28 cm² x 2 = 56 cm².\n\n3. The area of the top and bottom faces (length x width): 5 cm x 4 cm = 20 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 20 cm² x 2 = 40 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together: 70 cm² + 56 cm² + 40 cm² = 166 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 166 cm²."
