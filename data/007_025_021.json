    "message_1": "Suppose that the two parties in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange agreed to use a prime number p = 11 and a primitive root g = 2. The first party chooses a secret number a = 4, and the second party chooses a secret number b = 3. Calculate the shared secret key that they can use to encrypt and decrypt their messages.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the shared secret key in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is the first party's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Calculate B = g^b mod p, where b is the second party's secret number.\n3. Calculate the shared secret key as K = A^b mod p = B^a mod p.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. A = g^a mod p = 2^4 mod 11 = 16 mod 11 = 5\n2. B = g^b mod p = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\n3. K = A^b mod p = B^a mod p = 5^3 mod 11 = 8^4 mod 11 = 125 mod 11 = 4096 mod 11 = 3\n\nSo, the shared secret key is K = 3. Both parties can use this key to encrypt and decrypt their messages."
