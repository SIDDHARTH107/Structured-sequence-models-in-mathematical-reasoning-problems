    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profits per unit on A and B are $10 and $15, respectively. At least 300 units of the two products must be produced daily, and the total manufacturing capacity of the factory is 650 units/day. How many units of each type of product should the company produce to maximize the total daily profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≥ 300 (at least 300 units must be produced daily)\n2. x + y ≤ 650 (total manufacturing capacity is 650 units/day)\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negative production quantities)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total daily profit, P:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices A(0, 300), B(0, 650), C(350, 300), and D(650, 0).\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 10(0) + 15(300) = 4500\nP(B) = 10(0) + 15(650) = 9750\nP(C) = 10(350) + 15(300) = 8000\nP(D) = 10(650) + 15(0) = 6500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B with a profit of $9750. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 650 units of product B to maximize the total daily profit."
