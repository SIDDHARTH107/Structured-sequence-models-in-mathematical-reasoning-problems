    "message_1": "A boat is traveling at a speed of 20 km/h eastward from point A. The current of the water is flowing at a speed of 10 km/h southward. Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the boat using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the boat, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet V_east be the velocity of the boat eastward (20 km/h) and V_south be the velocity of the current southward (10 km/h). The resultant velocity V_resultant can be represented as a vector sum of V_east and V_south.\n\nFirst, we find the magnitude of the resultant velocity using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV_resultant = √(V_east^2 + V_south^2)\nV_resultant = √(20^2 + 10^2)\nV_resultant = √(400 + 100)\nV_resultant = √500\nV_resultant ≈ 22.36 km/h\n\nNow, we find the direction of the resultant velocity using trigonometry. We can use the tangent function to find the angle θ between the eastward direction and the resultant velocity:\n\ntan(θ) = V_south / V_east\ntan(θ) = 10 / 20\ntan(θ) = 0.5\n\nθ = arctan(0.5)\nθ ≈ 26.57°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant velocity of the boat is approximately 22.36 km/h, and its direction is approximately 26.57° south of east."
