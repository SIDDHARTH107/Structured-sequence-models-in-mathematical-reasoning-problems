    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and invertible matrix P such that A = PDP^(-1), we need to diagonalize the matrix A. We will first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[2, 4],\n [5, 7]]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues (λ) by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.\n\ndet([[2 - λ, 4],\n     [5, 7 - λ]]) = (2 - λ)(7 - λ) - (4)(5) = λ^2 - 9λ - 8\n\nSolve for λ:\nλ^2 - 9λ - 8 = 0\n(λ - 1)(λ - 8) = 0\nλ1 = 1, λ2 = 8\n\n2.
