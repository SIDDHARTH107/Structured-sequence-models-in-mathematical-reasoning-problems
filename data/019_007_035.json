    "message_1": "Sorry, it is not possible to provide a precise numerical problem for the subtopic Non-monotonic logic as it deals with reasoning patterns that may not follow the traditional laws of deductive reasoning. Non-monotonic logic is often used in artificial intelligence and expert systems, where the conclusion may be revised or updated based on new information. However, a possible question related to Non-monotonic logic could be:\n\n\"How can the principle of non-monotonic reasoning be applied to a system that updates its knowledge base based on uncertain or incomplete information?\"",
    "message_2": "Non-monotonic reasoning can be applied to a system that updates its knowledge base based on uncertain or incomplete information by using various techniques and methods. Some of these methods include:\n\n1. Default reasoning: In this approach, the system makes assumptions based on default rules when there is incomplete information. If new information becomes available that contradicts the default assumption, the system can revise its conclusions accordingly.\n\n2. Belief revision: This method involves updating the system's beliefs when new information is received. The system must determine which beliefs to keep, modify, or discard based on the new information, while maintaining consistency in its knowledge base.\n\n3. Abductive reasoning: In this approach, the system generates possible explanations (hypotheses) for the observed data and selects the best explanation based on available evidence. As new information becomes available, the system can revise its hypotheses and choose a new best explanation.\n\n4. Argumentation-based reasoning: This method involves constructing arguments for and against various conclusions based on the available information. The system evaluates the strength of these arguments and selects the most convincing conclusion. As new information becomes available, the system can update the arguments and potentially change its conclusion.\n\n5. Probabilistic reasoning: In this approach, the system represents uncertainty using probabilities and updates its beliefs based on Bayesian inference. As new information becomes available, the system updates the probabilities associated with its beliefs, allowing it to revise its conclusions based on the updated probabilities.\n\nBy incorporating one or more of these methods, a system can effectively apply non-monotonic reasoning to update its knowledge base when dealing with uncertain or incomplete information. This allows the system to adapt and make better decisions as new information becomes available."
