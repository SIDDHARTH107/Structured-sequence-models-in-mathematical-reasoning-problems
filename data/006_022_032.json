    "message_1": "A school has 200 students, out of which 60% are girls. If the probability of a girl student getting an A grade in Mathematics is 0.5, then what is the probability that a randomly chosen student from the school is a girl who got an A grade in Mathematics?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many girls are in the school. Since 60% of the students are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:\n\nNumber of girls = (60/100) * 200 = 120 girls\n\nNow, we know that the probability of a girl student getting an A grade in Mathematics is 0.5. So, the number of girls who got an A grade in Mathematics can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of girls with an A grade = 0.5 * 120 = 60 girls\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that a randomly chosen student is a girl who got an A grade in Mathematics. To do this, we can divide the number of girls with an A grade by the total number of students:\n\nProbability = (Number of girls with an A grade) / (Total number of students)\nProbability = 60 / 200 = 0.3\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen student from the school is a girl who got an A grade in Mathematics is 0.3 or 30%."
