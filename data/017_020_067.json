    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. Therefore, we have the following Sylow subgroups:\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroups: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups is denoted by n_2, and n_2 must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1 or 5. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which must be normal. If n_2 = 5, then there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8, and none of them are normal.\n- Sylow 5-subgroups: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups is denoted by n_5, and n_5 must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Thus, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, which must be normal.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of groups of order 40:\n\n1. If there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup, then the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroup can be either C8, C4xC2, or D4. The Sylow 5-subgroup is C5. Therefore, we have the following possibilities:\n\n   a) C8 x C5: This is the cyclic group C40.\n   b) C4xC2 x C5: This is the dihedral group D20.\n   c) D4 x C5: This is a non-abelian group of order 40.\n\n2. If there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, then the group is an extension of the Sylow 5-subgroup by one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. The Sylow 2-subgroup can be either C8 or C4xC2. The Sylow 5-subgroup is C5. Therefore, we have the following possibilities:\n\n   a) C8 : C5: There are 4 non-isomorphic groups of this form, all of which are non-abelian.\n   b) C4xC2 : C5: There are 3 non-isomorphic groups of this form, all of which are non-abelian.\n\nIn total, we have 1 cyclic group (C40), 1 dihedral group (D20), and 8 non-abelian groups of order 40. Therefore, there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 40, and every group of order 40 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C40, the dihedral group D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40."
