    "message_2": "To find the length of the resulting surface, we need to use the formula for the surface area of revolution:\n\nSurface Area (S) = 2π ∫[a, b] y(x) * sqrt(1 + (y'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y(x) with respect to x:\n\ny(x) = x^(2/3)\ny'(x) = (2/3)x^(-1/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the square of the derivative and add 1:\n\n(y'(x))^2 = (2/3)^2 * x^(-2/3)\n1 + (y'(x))^2 = 1 + (4/9)x^(-2/3)\n\nNext, we need to find the product of y(x) and the square root of the expression above:\n\ny(x) * sqrt(1 + (y'(x))^2) = x^(2/3) * sqrt(1 + (4/9)x^(-2/3))\n\nNow, we can plug this expression into the surface area formula and evaluate the integral:\n\nS = 2π ∫[0, 8] x^(2/3) * sqrt(1 + (4/9)x^(-2/3)) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 1 + (4/9)x^(-2/3)\n\nThen, the derivative of u with respect to x is:\n\ndu/dx = (-8/9)x^(-5/3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nS = 2π ∫[1, 1+(4/9)(8^(-2/3))] (9/8)u^(3/2) * (9/8)u^(-5/2) du\n\nSimplify the expression inside the integral:\n\nS = 2π ∫[1, 1+(4/9)(8^(-2/3))] (81/64)u^(-1) du\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nS = 2π * (81/64) [u^0] evaluated from 1 to 1+(4/9)(8^(-2/3))\n\nS = 2π * (81/64) [(1+(4/9)(8^(-2/3)))^0 - 1^0]\n\nS = 2π * (81/64) [1 - 1]\n\nS = 0\n\nThe surface area of the curve y = x^(2/3) revolved around the x-axis from 0 to 8 is 0. This is because the curve touches the x-axis at x=0, and when it is revolved around the x-axis, it forms a surface with zero thickness at that point, resulting in a surface area of 0."
