    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 8, we first need to find the first derivative of the function and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe first derivative of the function f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 8)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first try to factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n\n3(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can see that the equation is factored, and we can find the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 3 = 0  =>  x = 3\nx - 1 = 0  =>  x = 1\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 8 are x = 1 and x = 3."
