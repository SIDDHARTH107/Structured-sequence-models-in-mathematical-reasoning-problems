    "message_1": "A company produces a product at a cost of $50 per unit. The demand for the product is given by the equation q = 5000 - 20p, where q is the quantity demanded at a price of p dollars per unit. Determine the price that the company should sell the product to maximize its revenue.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the revenue, we need to find the price p that maximizes the revenue function R(p). The revenue function is given by the product of the price per unit and the quantity demanded, i.e., R(p) = p * q(p).\n\nGiven the demand function q(p) = 5000 - 20p, we can write the revenue function as:\n\nR(p) = p * (5000 - 20p)\n\nExpanding the revenue function, we get:\n\nR(p) = 5000p - 20p^2\n\nTo find the maximum revenue, we can take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to the price p and set it equal to zero:\n\ndR(p)/dp = 5000 - 40p = 0\n\nSolving for p, we get:\n\n40p = 5000\np = 5000 / 40\np = 125\n\nSo, the company should sell the product at a price of $125 per unit to maximize its revenue."
