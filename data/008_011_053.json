    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz). \n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 1  2  3 |\n| 2 -1  1 |\n| 3  4 -2 |\n\nD = | 1  2  3 | = 1(-8 + 4) - 2(6 - 3) + 3(8 - 4) = -4 - 4 + 12 = 4\n       | 2 -1  1 |\n       | 3  4 -2 |\n\nNow, let's find Dx, Dy, and Dz by replacing the respective columns with the constants (6, 3, 1).\n\nDx = | 6  2  3 | = 6(-8 + 4) - 2(6 - 3) + 3(8 - 4) = -24 - 4 + 12 = -16\n         | 3 -1  1 |\n         | 1  4 -2 |\n\nDy = | 1  6  3 | = 1(6 - 3) - 6(6 - 3) + 3(8 - 4) = 3 - 18 + 12 = -3\n         | 2  3  1 |\n         | 3  1 -2 |\n\nDz = | 1  2  6 | = 1(-2 + 4) - 2(2 - 3) + 6(8 - 4) = 2 + 2 + 24 = 28\n         | 2 -1  3 |\n         | 3  4  1 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z by dividing Dx, Dy, and Dz by D:\n\nx = Dx / D = -16 / 4 = -4\ny = Dy / D = -3 / 4\nz = Dz / D = 28 / 4 = 7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -4, y = -3/4, and z = 7."
