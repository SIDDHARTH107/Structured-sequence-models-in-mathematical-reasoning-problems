    "message_2": "To show that A is a compact metric space, we need to show that every open cover of A has a finite subcover. Let's denote the open cover of A as {U_i}, where i is an index in some index set I. Since A is a closed subset of X, its complement, A^c, is an open subset of X.\n\nNow, consider the open cover {U_i} ∪ {A^c} of X. Since X is a compact metric space, there exists a finite subcover of X, say {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n, A^c}. We claim that {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n} is a finite subcover of A.\n\nTo prove this, let's take an arbitrary point a ∈ A. Since {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n, A^c} is an open cover of X, a must belong to one of the sets U_i or A^c. But a ∈ A, so a cannot belong to A^c. Thus, a must belong to one of the sets U_i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. This shows that {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n} covers A.\n\nSince a was arbitrary, we have shown that {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n} is a finite subcover of A. Therefore, A is a compact metric space."
