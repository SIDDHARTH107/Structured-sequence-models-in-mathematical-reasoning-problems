    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the trigonometric function y = 3sin(2x) in the interval [0, π], we need to find the maximum value of the sine function and then multiply it by the amplitude (3 in this case).\n\nThe sine function has a maximum value of 1. Since the amplitude of the given function is 3, the maximum value of y = 3sin(2x) will be 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the function y = 3sin(2x) in the interval [0, π] is 3."
