    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series representation for the function f(z) = (z+2)/(z-3) centered at z=0, we can first rewrite the function as a sum of simpler functions.\n\nf(z) = (z+2)/(z-3) = 1 + 5/(z-3)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series representation for each term.\n\nFor the first term, 1, the Laurent series is simply 1 since it's a constant.\n\nFor the second term, 5/(z-3), we can use the geometric series formula. Recall that the geometric series formula is:\n\n1/(1-x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nIn our case, x = z/3. So,\n\n1/(1 - z/3) = 1 + (z/3) + (z/3)^2 + (z/3)^3 + ...\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 5:\n\n5/(z-3) = 5 + 5(z/3) + 5(z/3)^2 + 5(z/3)^3 + ...\n\nNow, we can combine the two series:\n\nf(z) = 1 + 5/(z-3) = 1 + 5 + 5(z/3) + 5(z/3)^2 + 5(z/3)^3 + ...\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nf(z) = 6 + (5/3)z + (5/9)z^2 + (5/27)z^3 + ...\n\nThis is the Laurent series representation for the function f(z) = (z+2)/(z-3) centered at z=0.\n\nNow, let's determine the annulus of convergence for the series. Since the Laurent series converges for the function f(z) = (z+2)/(z-3), the annulus of convergence is determined by the singularity at z=3. The series converges for all z such that |z-0|>|3-0|, or |z|>3.\n\nTherefore, the annulus of convergence for the Laurent series representation of f(z) = (z+2)/(z-3) centered at z=0 is |z|>3."
