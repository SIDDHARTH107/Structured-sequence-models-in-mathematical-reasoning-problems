    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the original dataset.\n2. Generate 10,000 bootstrap samples.\n3. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n4. Determine the 95% confidence interval for the mean.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of the original dataset\nMean = (5 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 13 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 32) / 10 = 162 / 10 = 16.2\n\nStep 2: Generate 10,000 bootstrap samples\nTo generate a bootstrap sample, we randomly select 10 numbers from the original dataset with replacement (meaning a number can be selected more than once). We will do this 10,000 times to create 10,000 bootstrap samples.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample\nFor each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples, we will calculate the mean.\n\nStep 4: Determine the 95% confidence interval for the mean\nTo determine the 95% confidence interval, we will first sort the 10,000 bootstrap means in ascending order. Then, we will find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted means. These percentiles will represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince I am an AI language model, I cannot perform the actual calculations and simulations. However, you can use statistical software or programming languages like R or Python to perform these steps and obtain the 95% confidence interval for the mean of the dataset."
