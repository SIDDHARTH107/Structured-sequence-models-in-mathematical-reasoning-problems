    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of these two sets. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nSymmetric difference (A x B) Δ (B x A) = (A x B) ∪ (B x A) - (A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is commutative. The symmetric difference is commutative if (A x B) Δ (B x A) = (B x A) Δ (A x B).\n\n(B x A) Δ (A x B) = (B x A) ∪ (A x B) - (B x A) ∩ (A x B) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)} - {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nSince (A x B) Δ (B x A) = (B x A) Δ (A x B), the symmetric difference is commutative."
