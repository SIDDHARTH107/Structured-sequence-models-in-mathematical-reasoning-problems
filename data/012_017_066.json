    "message_2": "Yes, there is a perfect matching in this graph. A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices such that each vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the matching.\n\nOne possible perfect matching for this graph is:\n\n{(1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 6)}\n\nThis matching covers all 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the matching."
