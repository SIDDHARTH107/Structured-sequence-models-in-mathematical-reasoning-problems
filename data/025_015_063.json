    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane passing through the points (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9), we first need to find two vectors lying on the plane and then find their cross product to get the normal vector of the plane.\n\nLet A(1,2,3), B(4,5,6), and C(7,8,9) be the given points. We can find two vectors AB and AC as follows:\n\nVector AB = B - A = (4-1, 5-2, 6-3) = (3, 3, 3)\nVector AC = C - A = (7-1, 8-2, 9-3) = (6, 6, 6)\n\nNow, we need to find the cross product of these two vectors to get the normal vector of the plane:\n\nN = AB Ã— AC\n\nHowever, we can notice that AB and AC are parallel vectors (AC = 2 * AB), and their cross product will be a zero vector. This means that the three given points are collinear and do not form a unique plane. Therefore, there is no specific equation for the plane passing through these points."
