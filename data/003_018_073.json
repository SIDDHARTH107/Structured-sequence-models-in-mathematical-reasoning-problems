    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 5 sin(3x) - 2 cos(4x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, our outer functions are 5 sin(u) and -2 cos(v), and our inner functions are u = 3x and v = 4x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of the outer functions:\n\ndy/du = 5 cos(u)\ndy/dv = 2 sin(v)\n\nNow, let's find the derivatives of the inner functions:\n\ndu/dx = 3\ndv/dx = 4\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (dy/du * du/dx) - (dy/dv * dv/dx)\ndy/dx = (5 cos(u) * 3) - (2 sin(v) * 4)\n\nNow, we need to substitute back the inner functions u = 3x and v = 4x:\n\ndy/dx = (5 cos(3x) * 3) - (2 sin(4x) * 4)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative at x = pi/6:\n\ndy/dx(pi/6) = (5 cos(3(pi/6)) * 3) - (2 sin(4(pi/6)) * 4)\ndy/dx(pi/6) = (5 cos(pi/2) * 3) - (2 sin(2pi/3) * 4)\n\nSince cos(pi/2) = 0 and sin(2pi/3) = √3/2:\n\ndy/dx(pi/6) = (5 * 0 * 3) - (2 * (√3/2) * 4)\ndy/dx(pi/6) = - (2 * √3/2 * 4)\ndy/dx(pi/6) = - 4√3\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 5 sin(3x) - 2 cos(4x) at x = pi/6 is -4√3."
