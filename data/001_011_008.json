    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we will first find a common denominator, which is the product of the three denominators: (x+1)(x-2)(x-1). Then, we will multiply each term by the common denominator to eliminate the fractions. Finally, we will simplify and solve for x.\n\nStep 1: Find the common denominator\nThe common denominator is (x+1)(x-2)(x-1).\n\nStep 2: Multiply each term by the common denominator\n(3/(x+1)) * ((x-2)(x-1)) + (5/(x-2)) * ((x+1)(x-1)) = (2/(x-1)) * ((x+1)(x-2))\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation\n3(x-2)(x-1) + 5(x+1)(x-1) = 2(x+1)(x-2)\n\nStep 4: Expand the equation\n3(x^2 - 3x + 2) + 5(x^2 - x - 2) = 2(x^2 - x - 2)\n\nStep 5: Distribute the constants\n3x^2 - 9x + 6 + 5x^2 - 5x - 10 = 2x^2 - 2x - 4\n\nStep 6: Combine like terms\n8x^2 - 14x - 16 = 2x^2 - 2x - 4\n\nStep 7: Move all terms to one side\n6x^2 - 12x - 12 = 0\n\nStep 8: Simplify the equation\nx^2 - 2x - 2 = 0\n\nStep 9: Solve for x using the quadratic formula\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(12)) / 2\nx = (2 ± 2√3) / 2\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are:\nx = 1 + √3 and x = 1 - √3"
