    "message_2": "To find the degree and dimension of the projective variety $V$, we first analyze the given polynomial equations.\n\nThe first polynomial equation $f_1$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3. The second polynomial equation $f_2$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the dimension of $V$. Since we have two polynomial equations in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, the dimension of $V$ is expected to be $3 - 2 = 1$. However, we need to check if these two equations are independent. If they are dependent, the dimension of $V$ would be 2.\n\nNotice that $f_1$ is the equation of a twisted cubic curve in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. This curve is not contained in the surface defined by $f_2$, so the two equations are independent. Therefore, the dimension of $V$ is indeed 1.\n\nNow, let's find the degree of $V$. The degree of a projective variety is the number of intersection points with a generic hyperplane. In this case, we can consider the intersection of $V$ with a generic hyperplane $H$ defined by the equation $x_3 = 0$. \n\nThe intersection of $V$ and $H$ is given by the solutions of the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_0^3 - 3x_0^2x_1 + 3x_0x_1^2 - x_1^3 &= 0 \\\\\nx_0^2x_2 - 2x_0x_1x_2 + x_1^2x_2 + x_2^3 &= 0 \\\\\nx_3 &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $x_2(x_0^2 - 2x_0x_1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 0$. Since $x_2$ is a homogeneous coordinate, we cannot divide by it. Thus, we have two cases to consider:\n\n1. $x_2 = 0$. In this case, the first equation becomes $x_0^3 - 3x_0^2x_1 + 3x_0x_1^2 - x_1^3 = 0$, which is the equation of a twisted cubic curve. This curve has degree 3.\n\n2. $x_0^2 - 2x_0x_1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 0$. This is the equation of a conic in the plane $x_3 = 0$. The intersection of this conic with the twisted cubic curve given by the first equation will give us additional intersection points.\n\nTo find the number of intersection points between the twisted cubic curve and the conic, we can use the technique of resultants. The resultant of the two polynomials with respect to $x_0$ is a polynomial in $x_1$ and $x_2$ of degree 6. Since the twisted cubic curve and the conic are both non-singular, the number of intersection points is equal to the degree of the resultant, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the projective variety $V$ is the sum of the intersection points in both cases, which is $3 + 6 = 9$.\n\nIn conclusion, the dimension of $V$ is 1, and the degree of $V$ is 9."
