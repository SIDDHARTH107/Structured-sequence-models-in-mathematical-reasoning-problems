    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve that covers a square with a continuous curve. In each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 3. \n\nLet's denote the length of the curve after n iterations as L_n. After the first iteration, the length of the curve is 3 times the length of the square's edge, so L_1 = 3.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by 3. Therefore, the length of the curve after 4 iterations is:\n\nL_4 = L_1 * 3^(4-1) = 3 * 3^3 = 3 * 27 = 81\n\nSo, the total length of the Peano curve after 4 iterations is 81."
