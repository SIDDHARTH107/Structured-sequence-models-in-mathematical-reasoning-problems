    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to find the angles whose sine is 0.5 within the given range of 0 to 360 degrees. \n\nsin(x) = 0.5\n\nThe sine function has a positive value in the first and second quadrants. We can find the angle in the first quadrant using the inverse sine function:\n\nx = sin^(-1)(0.5)\n\nx ≈ 30 degrees\n\nNow, we need to find the angle in the second quadrant. Since sine is positive in the second quadrant and the sine function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, the angle in the second quadrant will be the supplement of the angle in the first quadrant:\n\nx = 180 - 30\n\nx = 150 degrees\n\nSo, the two angles x within the range of 0 to 360 degrees for which sin(x) = 0.5 are x ≈ 30 degrees and x = 150 degrees."
