    "message_1": "Let G be a higher-order logic formula that defines a binary operation * on a set S. If G defines a commutative operation, how many elements are there in S?",
    "message_2": "The information given is not sufficient to determine the number of elements in set S. A commutative operation is an operation that satisfies the property a * b = b * a for all elements a and b in the set S. However, this property does not provide any information about the size of the set S. The set S could have any number of elements, as long as the operation * is commutative on that set."
