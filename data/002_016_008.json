    "message_2": "An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the length of each side, divide the perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nLength of each side = Perimeter / 3\nLength of each side = 36 cm / 3\nLength of each side = 12 cm\n\nEach side of the equilateral triangle is 12 cm long."
