    "message_2": "To compute the value of the integral ∫₀¹ x² dx, we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that if a function has an antiderivative F(x), then the definite integral of the function over an interval [a, b] is given by F(b) - F(a).\n\nFirst, we need to find the antiderivative of x². The antiderivative of x^n, where n is a constant, is given by (x^(n+1))/(n+1). In this case, n = 2, so the antiderivative of x² is (x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (x^3)/3.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of the integral:\n\nF(1) = (1^3)/3 = 1/3\nF(0) = (0^3)/3 = 0\n\nFinally, we can compute the value of the integral:\n\n∫₀¹ x² dx = F(1) - F(0) = (1/3) - 0 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the value of ∫₀¹ x² dx is 1/3."
