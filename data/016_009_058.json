    "message_2": "The length of the Dragon Curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial segment length * 2^n * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 8 iterations. So, we have:\n\nLength = 1 * 2^8 * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nLength = 1 * 256 * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nLength = 256 * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nLength = 128 * sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the length of the Dragon Curve after 8 iterations is 128 * sqrt(2) units."
