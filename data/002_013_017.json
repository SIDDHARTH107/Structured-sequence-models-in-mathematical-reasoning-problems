    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 10 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid is the area of the rectangle, which can be found using the formula:\n\nBase area = length * width\n\nSo, the base area is:\n\nBase area = 8 cm * 6 cm = 48 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 48 cm² * 10 cm = (1/3) * 480 cm³ = 160 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
