    "message_1": "A manufacturer has 3 machines that produce bolts. Each machine produces bolts of different quality, but the quality of bolts produced by each machine is consistent. The manufacturer wants to classify bolts produced by the machines based on their quality. The following data shows the number of defective bolts (out of a sample of 100) produced by each machine:\n\nMachine A: 20 defective bolts\nMachine B: 10 defective bolts\nMachine C: 15 defective bolts\n\nUsing discriminant analysis, determine the equation of the line that separates the three groups of bolts.",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we first need to find the centroids of each group. The centroids are the average coordinates of each group. In this case, the coordinates are the number of defective bolts and the machine number (1 for Machine A, 2 for Machine B, and 3 for Machine C). \n\nCentroid A (Machine A): (1, 20)\nCentroid B (Machine B): (2, 10)\nCentroid C (Machine C): (3, 15)\n\nNow, we need to find the line that separates these centroids. We can do this by finding the midpoint between each pair of centroids and then finding the line that is perpendicular to the line connecting the centroids and passes through the midpoint.\n\n1. Midpoint between Centroid A and Centroid B: ((1+2)/2, (20+10)/2) = (1.5, 15)\n2. Midpoint between Centroid B and Centroid C: ((2+3)/2, (10+15)/2) = (2.5, 12.5)\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the line connecting Centroid A and Centroid B, and Centroid B and Centroid C.\n\n1. Slope between Centroid A and Centroid B: (10-20)/(2-1) = -10\n2. Slope between Centroid B and Centroid C: (15-10)/(3-2) = 5\n\nThe perpendicular slope to the line connecting Centroid A and Centroid B is the negative reciprocal of the slope:\n\nPerpendicular slope: 1/10\n\nSimilarly, the perpendicular slope to the line connecting Centroid B and Centroid C is the negative reciprocal of the slope:\n\nPerpendicular slope: -1/5\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the lines that pass through the midpoints and have the perpendicular slopes.\n\n1. Line separating Centroid A and Centroid B:\ny - 15 = (1/10)(x - 1.5)\ny = (1/10)x + 14.85\n\n2. Line separating Centroid B and Centroid C:\ny - 12.5 = (-1/5)(x - 2.5)\ny = (-1/5)x + 13\n\nSo, the equations of the lines separating the three groups of bolts are:\n\ny = (1/10)x + 14.85 (separating Machine A and Machine B)\ny = (-1/5)x + 13 (separating Machine B and Machine C)"
