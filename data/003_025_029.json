    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the plane's velocity relative to the ground, we can break down the velocity into its horizontal (eastward) and vertical (northward) components.\n\nThe horizontal component (Vx) can be found using the cosine function:\nVx = V * cos(θ)\nVx = 400 km/h * cos(30°)\nVx ≈ 400 km/h * 0.866\nVx ≈ 346.4 km/h (Eastward)\n\nThe vertical component (Vy) can be found using the sine function:\nVy = V * sin(θ)\nVy = 400 km/h * sin(30°)\nVy ≈ 400 km/h * 0.5\nVy ≈ 200 km/h (Northward)\n\nNow that we have the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity, we can find the magnitude of the plane's velocity relative to the ground using the Pythagorean theorem:\nV = √(Vx^2 + Vy^2)\nV = √((346.4 km/h)^2 + (200 km/h)^2)\nV ≈ √(120,025.76 + 40,000)\nV ≈ √(160,025.76)\nV ≈ 400 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the plane's velocity relative to the ground is 400 km/h.\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(Vy / Vx)\nθ = arctan(200 km/h / 346.4 km/h)\nθ ≈ arctan(0.577)\nθ ≈ 30°\n\nThe direction of the plane's velocity relative to the ground is 30° North of East.\n\nSo, the plane's velocity relative to the ground is 400 km/h at a direction of 30° North of East."
