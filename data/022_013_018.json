    "message_2": "The given functions are already analytic. An analytic function is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series. In this case, both $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are given by convergent power series.\n\n$f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1$ is a polynomial, and polynomials are always analytic.\n\n$g(z) = \\frac{1}{z - 1}$ is a rational function, and rational functions are analytic except at their poles. In this case, $g(z)$ has a pole at $z = 1$, but is analytic everywhere else.\n\nNow, let's find the product of these two analytic functions:\n\n$f(z)g(z) = (z^2 + 2z + 1)\\left(\\frac{1}{z - 1}\\right) = \\frac{z^2 + 2z + 1}{z - 1}$\n\nThis is a rational function, and it is analytic everywhere except at its pole, which is $z = 1$."
