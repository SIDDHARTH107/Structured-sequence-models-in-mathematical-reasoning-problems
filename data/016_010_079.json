    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the curvatures of the circles in the Apollonian Gasket. The curvature (k) of a circle is defined as the reciprocal of its radius (r): k = 1/r. \n\nLet's denote the initial circle's curvature as k0. Since the radius of the initial circle is 3, its curvature is k0 = 1/3.\n\nNow, let's consider the first layer of circles. There are three circles in this layer, each of which is tangent to the initial circle and the other two circles in the first layer. According to the Descartes' Circle Theorem, the curvatures of these circles are related as follows:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 = 2 * k0\n\nSince k1 = k2 = k3 (all three circles in the first layer have the same curvature), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3 * k1 = 2 * k0\n\nNow we can solve for k1:\n\nk1 = (2/3) * k0 = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\n\nThe radius of each circle in the first layer is r1 = 1/k1 = 9/2. The sum of the radii of the circles in the first layer is 3 * r1 = 27/2.\n\nFor the subsequent layers, we can use a similar approach to find the curvatures and radii of the circles. However, the number of circles in each layer increases, making the calculations more complex. To find the sum of the radii of all the circles in the first five layers, we can use a recursive algorithm or a computer program.\n\nThe sum of the radii of all the circles in the first five layers of the Apollonian Gasket with an initial radius of 3 is approximately 126.32."
