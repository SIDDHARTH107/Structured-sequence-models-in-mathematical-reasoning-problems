    "message_2": "To determine whether X is compact or not, we can use the open cover definition of compactness. A space X is compact if every open cover of X has a finite subcover.\n\nLet's consider the open cover of X consisting of the open intervals:\n\nU_n = (-1/n, 1 + 1/n) for n = 2, 3, 4, ...\n\nNotice that U_n contains all the elements of X, since 0 is in every U_n, and 1/k is in U_n for all n > k. Therefore, this is an open cover of X.\n\nNow, let's try to find a finite subcover of this open cover. Suppose we have a finite collection of U_n's that cover X. Let m be the largest index of the U_n's in this finite collection. Then, the interval U_m = (-1/m, 1 + 1/m) will not contain the element 1/(m+1), which is in X. This means that no finite subcollection of the U_n's can cover X.\n\nSince we have found an open cover of X that does not have a finite subcover, we can conclude that X is not compact."
