    "message_2": "To find the degree of the divisor $D$, we simply need to sum the coefficients of each of the points in the divisor. In this case, the divisor is given by $D = 5P_1 - 2P_2 - 3P_3$. \n\nThe degree of the divisor $D$ is then:\n\n$$\\deg(D) = 5 - 2 - 3 = 0$$\n\nSo, the degree of the divisor $D$ is 0."
