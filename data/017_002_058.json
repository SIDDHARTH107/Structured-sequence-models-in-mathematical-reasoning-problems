    "message_2": "To find an element x of G such that H = <x>, we need to find a generator of the subgroup H. Since G is a cyclic group of order 20, it has a generator g such that G = <g> and the order of g is 20. The possible orders of subgroups of G are divisors of 20, which are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.\n\nLet's denote the order of H as n. Then, H has n elements, and we can find an element x in G such that the order of x is n. To do this, we can use the following property of cyclic groups:\n\nIf G = <g> is a cyclic group of order m and k is a divisor of m, then there exists an element x in G such that the order of x is k, and x = g^(m/k).\n\nNow, let's find an element x of G such that H = <x>:\n\n1. If n = 1, then H is the trivial subgroup, and x = g^20 = e (the identity element).\n2. If n = 2, then x = g^(20/2) = g^10.\n3. If n = 4, then x = g^(20/4) = g^5.\n4. If n = 5, then x = g^(20/5) = g^4.\n5. If n = 10, then x = g^(20/10) = g^2.\n6. If n = 20, then H = G, and x = g.\n\nSo, depending on the order of the subgroup H, we can find an element x of G such that H = <x> using the above results."
