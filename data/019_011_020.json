    "message_1": "Suppose a store has 100 apples, 50 oranges, and 25 pears. If a customer buys 1 apple and 2 oranges, how many possible combinations of fruits can the customer choose? Use relevance logic to determine the answer.",
    "message_2": "Since the customer buys 1 apple and 2 oranges, we only need to consider the number of apples and oranges available in the store. The number of pears is irrelevant in this case.\n\nThere are 100 apples and 50 oranges in the store. The customer can choose 1 apple out of 100 and 2 oranges out of 50.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 apple out of 100 is C(100,1), and the number of ways to choose 2 oranges out of 50 is C(50,2).\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(100,1) = 100! / (1!(100-1)!) = 100! / (1! * 99!) = 100\n\nC(50,2) = 50! / (2!(50-2)!) = 50! / (2! * 48!) = (50 * 49) / (2 * 1) = 1225\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of combinations of choosing 1 apple and 2 oranges:\n\nTotal combinations = C(100,1) * C(50,2) = 100 * 1225 = 122500\n\nSo, there are 122,500 possible combinations of fruits the customer can choose."
