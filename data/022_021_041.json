    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = e^(-2t)cos(3t) for t > 0, we can use the formula for the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st)f(t)dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nIn this case, f(t) = e^(-2t)cos(3t). So we have:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st)e^(-2t)cos(3t)dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-(s+2)t)cos(3t)dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let:\n\nu = e^(-(s+2)t)\ndv = cos(3t)dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = -(s+2)e^(-(s+2)t)dt\nv = (1/3)sin(3t)\n\nNow, applying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = uv | from 0 to ∞ - ∫(vdu) from 0 to ∞\n\nF(s) = (1/3)e^(-(s+2)t)sin(3t) | from 0 to ∞ + (1/3)(s+2)∫(e^(-(s+2)t)sin(3t)dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the exponential term e^(-(s+2)t) goes to 0, so the first term becomes 0. Now we have:\n\nF(s) = (1/3)(s+2)∫(e^(-(s+2)t)sin(3t)dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this remaining integral, we can use integration by parts again. Let:\n\nu = e^(-(s+2)t)\ndv = sin(3t)dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = -(s+2)e^(-(s+2)t)dt\nv = (-1/3)cos(3t)\n\nNow, applying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = (1/3)(s+2)(-uv | from 0 to ∞ + ∫(vdu) from 0 to ∞)\n\nF(s) = (1/3)(s+2)((1/3)e^(-(s+2)t)cos(3t) | from 0 to ∞ + (1/3)(s+2)∫(e^(-(s+2)t)cos(3t)dt) from 0 to ∞)\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the exponential term e^(-(s+2)t) goes to 0, so the first term becomes 0. Now we have:\n\nF(s) = (1/3)(s+2)(1/3)(s+2)∫(e^(-(s+2)t)cos(3t)dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nNotice that this is the same integral we started with, multiplied by a constant factor. Let's call this integral I:\n\nI = ∫(e^(-(s+2)t)cos(3t)dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nNow we have:\n\nF(s) = (1/9)(s+2)^2 * I\n\nWe can solve for I:\n\nI = F(s) / ((1/9)(s+2)^2)\n\nNow, substituting back into the original equation:\n\nF(s) = (1/9)(s+2)^2 * F(s) / ((1/9)(s+2)^2)\n\nCancelling out the terms, we get:\n\nF(s) = F(s)\n\nThis means that the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = e^(-2t)cos(3t) is:\n\nF(s) = (s+2) / ((s+2)^2 + 3^2)\n\nF(s) = (s+2) / (s^2 + 4s + 13)"
