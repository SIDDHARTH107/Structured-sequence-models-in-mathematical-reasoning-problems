    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to add the lengths of all four sides.\n\nPerimeter = length of first base + length of second base + length of first non-parallel side + length of second non-parallel side\n\nGiven:\nLength of first base = 5 cm\nLength of second base = 12 cm\nLength of first non-parallel side = 7 cm\nLength of second non-parallel side = 7 cm\n\nPerimeter = 5 cm + 12 cm + 7 cm + 7 cm = 31 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 31 cm."
