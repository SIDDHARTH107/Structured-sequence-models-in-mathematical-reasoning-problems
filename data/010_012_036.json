    "message_2": "a) To find the critical points of the function, we first need to find its derivative, $f'(x)$.\n\n$f(x) = x^3 - 3x - 1$\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x - 1) = 3x^2 - 3$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $x$ for which $f'(x) = 0$. This will give us the critical points.\n\n$3x^2 - 3 = 0$\n\n$x^2 = 1$\n\n$x = \\pm 1$\n\nSo, the critical points are $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.\n\nb) To determine the number of local maxima and minima, we can use the second derivative test. First, we need to find the second derivative, $f''(x)$.\n\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(x^3 - 3x - 1) = \\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2 - 3) = 6x$\n\nNow, we will evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\n$f''(-1) = 6(-1) = -6 < 0$, which means there is a local maximum at $x = -1$.\n\n$f''(1) = 6(1) = 6 > 0$, which means there is a local minimum at $x = 1$.\n\nSo, there is 1 local maximum and 1 local minimum.\n\nc) To find the intervals where $f(x)$ is increasing or decreasing, we can use the first derivative, $f'(x)$.\n\n$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3$\n\nWe already found the critical points at $x = -1$ and $x = 1$. We will now test the intervals around these critical points to determine whether the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\nInterval $(-\\infty, -1)$:\nChoose a test point, say $x = -2$. Then, $f'(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 3 = 9 > 0$. Since the first derivative is positive, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(-\\infty, -1)$.\n\nInterval $(-1, 1)$:\nChoose a test point, say $x = 0$. Then, $f'(0) = 3(0)^2 - 3 = -3 < 0$. Since the first derivative is negative, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n\nInterval $(1, \\infty)$:\nChoose a test point, say $x = 2$. Then, $f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 3 = 9 > 0$. Since the first derivative is positive, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(1, \\infty)$.\n\nIn summary, $f(x)$ is increasing on the intervals $(-\\infty, -1)$ and $(1, \\infty)$, and decreasing on the interval $(-1, 1)$."
