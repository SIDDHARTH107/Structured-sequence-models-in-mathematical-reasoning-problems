    "message_2": "To find all the points (x, y) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x - 6 over the finite field Z11, we will plug in all possible x values from 0 to 10 (since Z11 has 11 elements) and check if there exists a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation.\n\n1. For x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 7*0 - 6 = -6 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\nThere are no y values that satisfy this equation since no y^2 is congruent to 5 (mod 11).\n\n2. For x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 7*1 - 6 = 2\ny = ±sqrt(2) (mod 11)\ny = ±7 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (1, 7) and (1, 4).\n\n3. For x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 7*2 - 6 = 18 ≡ 7 (mod 11)\nThere are no y values that satisfy this equation since no y^2 is congruent to 7 (mod 11).\n\n4. For x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 7*3 - 6 = 48 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\ny = ±sqrt(4) (mod 11)\ny = ±2 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (3, 2) and (3, 9).\n\n5. For x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 7*4 - 6 = 94 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\ny = ±sqrt(1) (mod 11)\ny = ±1 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (4, 1) and (4, 10).\n\n6. For x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 7*5 - 6 = 164 ≡ 0 (mod 11)\ny = ±sqrt(0) (mod 11)\ny = 0 (mod 11)\nSo, the point is (5, 0).\n\n7. For x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 7*6 - 6 = 258 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\ny = ±sqrt(1) (mod 11)\ny = ±1 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (6, 1) and (6, 10).\n\n8. For x = 7:\ny^2 = 7^3 + 7*7 - 6 = 372 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\ny = ±sqrt(4) (mod 11)\ny = ±2 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (7, 2) and (7, 9).\n\n9. For x = 8:\ny^2 = 8^3 + 7*8 - 6 = 510 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\ny = ±sqrt(2) (mod 11)\ny = ±7 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (8, 7) and (8, 4).\n\n10. For x = 9:\ny^2 = 9^3 + 7*9 - 6 = 672 ≡ 7 (mod 11)\nThere are no y values that satisfy this equation since no y^2 is congruent to 7 (mod 11).\n\n11. For x = 10:\ny^2 = 10^3 + 7*10 - 6 = 850 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\nThere are no y values that satisfy this equation since no y^2 is congruent to 5 (mod 11).\n\nSo, the points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x - 6 over the finite field Z11 are:\n(1, 7), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 10), (5, 0), (6, 1), (6, 10), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 7), and (8, 4)."
