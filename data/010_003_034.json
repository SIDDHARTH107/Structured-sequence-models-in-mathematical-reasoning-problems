    "message_1": "Let X be a topological space such that every closed set is the intersection of finitely many open sets. If X has exactly 12 open sets, what is the maximum number of closed sets that X can have?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the power set of the 12 open sets, which is the set of all possible subsets of the 12 open sets. Each element of the power set represents a possible intersection of open sets. Since each closed set is the intersection of finitely many open sets, the maximum number of closed sets that X can have is equal to the number of elements in the power set of the 12 open sets.\n\nThe number of elements in the power set of a set with n elements is 2^n. In this case, n = 12, so the power set has 2^12 = 4096 elements. However, we need to subtract 1 from this number because the empty set, which is an element of the power set, does not correspond to a closed set (it corresponds to the intersection of no open sets, which is the whole space X, which is open).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of closed sets that X can have is 4096 - 1 = 4095."
