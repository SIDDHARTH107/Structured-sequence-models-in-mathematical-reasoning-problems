    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg with a length of 5 cm and the other leg with a length of 12 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nc² = 5² + 12²\nc² = 25 + 144\nc² = 169\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √169\nc = 13 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 13 cm."
