    "message_1": "Suppose you want to encrypt the message \"SECRET MESSAGE\" using the Rail Fence cipher with a key of 3. Write the encrypted message and explain the steps you took to get it.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"SECRET MESSAGE\" using the Rail Fence cipher with a key of 3, follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the message in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\n   S   E   M   S   E\n    C R T M S A G\n     E   S   A   G\n\n2. Read the message from left to right, starting from the top row:\n\n   SEMSE, CRTMSAG, ESAG\n\n3. Combine the parts to get the encrypted message:\n\n   SEMSECRTMSAGESAG\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"SEMSECRTMSAGESAG\".\n\nExplanation: The Rail Fence cipher works by writing the message in a zigzag pattern along a set number of rows (in this case, 3). The encrypted message is then created by reading the characters from left to right, starting from the top row and moving down to the bottom row. This process rearranges the characters in the message, making it harder to read without knowing the key (number of rows) used for encryption."
