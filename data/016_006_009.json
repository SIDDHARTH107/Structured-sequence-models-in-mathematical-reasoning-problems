    "message_2": "To find the number of points that fall within a circle with radius 1 after applying each transformation 10,000 times, we can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef f1(x, y):\n    return (0, 0.16 * y)\n\ndef f2(x, y):\n    return (0.85 * x + 0.04 * y, -0.04 * x + 0.85 * y + 1.6)\n\ndef f3(x, y):\n    return (0.2 * x - 0.26 * y, 0.23 * x + 0.22 * y + 1.6)\n\ndef f4(x, y):\n    return (-0.15 * x + 0.28 * y, 0.26 * x + 0.24 * y + 0.44)\n\ndef is_within_circle(x, y, radius=1):\n    return x**2 + y**2 <= radius**2\n\ntransformations = [f1, f2, f3, f4]\nx, y = 0, 0\npoints_within_circle = 0\n\nfor _ in range(10000):\n    f = random.choice(transformations)\n    x, y = f(x, y)\n    if is_within_circle(x, y):\n        points_within_circle += 1\n\nprint(points_within_circle)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the number of points that fall within a circle with radius 1 after applying each transformation 10,000 times. Note that due to the random nature of the Barnsley fern, the result may vary slightly each time you run the code."
