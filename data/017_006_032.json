    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers, we can apply the Sylow theorems to G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_5, must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_7, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus, n_7 can also only be 1.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G and Q be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup of G. Since n_5 = n_7 = 1, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G. Moreover, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, so P and Q are cyclic groups (as they have prime order).\n\nNow, consider the product set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. We claim that PQ is a subgroup of G. To show this, we need to verify that PQ is closed under the group operation and inverses.\n\nLet x, y ∈ PQ, so x = p_1q_1 and y = p_2q_2 for some p_1, p_2 ∈ P and q_1, q_2 ∈ Q. Then, xy = p_1q_1p_2q_2. Since Q is normal in G, we can find some q_3 ∈ Q such that q_1p_2 = p_2q_3. Thus, xy = p_1p_2q_3q_2, which is in PQ since p_1p_2 ∈ P and q_3q_2 ∈ Q. Therefore, PQ is closed under the group operation.\n\nNext, let x = pq ∈ PQ, where p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Then, x⁻¹ = (pq)⁻¹ = q⁻¹p⁻¹. Since P is normal in G, we can find some p' ∈ P such that q⁻¹p = p'q⁻¹. Thus, x⁻¹ = p'q⁻¹q⁻¹, which is in PQ since p' ∈ P and q⁻¹ ∈ Q. Therefore, PQ is closed under inverses.\n\nSince PQ is closed under the group operation and inverses, PQ is a subgroup of G. Furthermore, |PQ| = |P||Q| = 5 * 7 = 35, so PQ = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be either cyclic (if P and Q are not distinct) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7 (if P and Q are distinct)."
