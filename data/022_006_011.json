    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of the function f(z) = z^3 - 3z^2 + 2 in the closed disc |z| <= 2, we will first find the critical points of the function and then evaluate the modulus of the function at the boundary of the disc.\n\nLet's find the critical points by setting the derivative of f(z) equal to 0:\n\nf'(z) = 3z^2 - 6z\n\nSetting f'(z) = 0, we get:\n\n3z^2 - 6z = 0\nz(3z - 6) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points: z = 0 and z = 2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the modulus of the function at the boundary of the disc, |z| = 2. We will parameterize the boundary using polar coordinates:\n\nz = 2 * e^(i * theta), where 0 <= theta <= 2 * pi\n\nf(z) = (2 * e^(i * theta))^3 - 3 * (2 * e^(i * theta))^2 + 2\n     = 8 * e^(3i * theta) - 12 * e^(2i * theta) + 2\n\nNow, let's find the modulus of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |8 * e^(3i * theta) - 12 * e^(2i * theta) + 2|\n\nSince finding the exact maximum and minimum of this expression is difficult, we can use numerical methods to approximate the maximum and minimum values.\n\nUsing numerical methods, we find that the maximum modulus is approximately 26 and occurs at the boundary of the disc (|z| = 2). The minimum modulus is approximately 0 and occurs at the critical point z = 2.\n\nSo, the maximum modulus of the function f(z) = z^3 - 3z^2 + 2 in the closed disc |z| <= 2 is approximately 26, and the minimum modulus is approximately 0."
