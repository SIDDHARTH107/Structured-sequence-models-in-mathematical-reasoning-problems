    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group of order 28, there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩, where ⟨g⟩ denotes the cyclic subgroup generated by g. Now, let H be a subgroup of G with order 7. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Since the order of H is 7 and 7 is a prime number that divides 28, H must be a proper subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the element g^4 (g raised to the power of 4). Since the order of G is 28, the order of g^4 is the smallest positive integer n such that (g^4)^n = g^(4n) = e (the identity element), where e is the identity element of G. By Euler's theorem, we have:\n\ng^(4 * 7) = e\n\nSo, the order of g^4 divides 7. Since 7 is a prime number, the order of g^4 must be either 1 or 7. If the order of g^4 is 1, then g^4 = e, which implies that the order of g is at most 4, contradicting the fact that G has order 28. Therefore, the order of g^4 must be 7.\n\nNow, let h = g^4. Since the order of h is 7, the cyclic subgroup generated by h, denoted by ⟨h⟩, has order 7. We know that H is a subgroup of G with order 7, and ⟨h⟩ is also a subgroup of G with order 7. Since there can be only one subgroup of order 7 in G (due to the prime order), we must have H = ⟨h⟩.\n\nThus, H is a cyclic subgroup generated by the element h, and therefore H is cyclic."
