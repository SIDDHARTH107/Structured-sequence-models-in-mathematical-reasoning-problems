This means that (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nNow, we are looking for the smallest positive integer n such that (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n. Since Wilson's Theorem holds for prime numbers, let's start by checking the smallest prime numbers:\n\n1. For n = 2 (prime), (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.\n2. For n = 3 (prime), (3-1)! + 1 = 2! + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which is divisible by 3.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer n such that (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n is n = 2."
