    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor (the number of cubes in each direction).\n\nIn this case, the number of cubes in each direction is 5, so s = 5. The Vicsek fractal has 5 non-overlapping self-similar pieces (the central cube and the 4 corner cubes), so N = 5.\n\nNow we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(5) / log(5)\nD = 1\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the number of cubes in each direction is 5 is 1."
