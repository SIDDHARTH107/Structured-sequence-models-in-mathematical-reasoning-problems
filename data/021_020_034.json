    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain quantity of shirts. The cost function is given by:\n\nC(x) = 5000 + 10x + 0.01x^2\n\nWhere x is the number of shirts produced. Use the artificial bee colony algorithm to find the minimum cost and the corresponding value of x. The range of x is from 100 to 1000 with an interval of 10.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters: number of employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees, as well as the number of iterations.\n2. Generate the initial population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the given range.\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n4. Perform the employed bee phase: modify the solutions and evaluate the new fitness.\n5. Perform the onlooker bee phase: select the best solutions and modify them, then evaluate the new fitness.\n6. Perform the scout bee phase: if a solution is not improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new random solution.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 for the given number of iterations.\n8. Find the best solution (minimum cost) and the corresponding value of x.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the ABC algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef cost_function(x):\n    return 5000 + 10 * x + 0.01 * x ** 2\n\ndef fitness_function(cost):\n    return 1 / (1 + cost)\n\ndef generate_initial_population(size, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    return [random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound) for _ in range(size)]\n\ndef modify_solution(solution, partner_solution, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    phi = random.uniform(-1, 1)\n    new_solution = solution + phi * (solution - partner_solution)\n    return int(min(max(new_solution, lower_bound), upper_bound))\n\ndef abc_algorithm(iterations, population_size, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    employed_bees = int(population_size / 2)\n    onlooker_bees = employed_bees\n\n    population = generate_initial_population(population_size, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    fitness_values = [fitness_function(cost_function(x)) for x in population]\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Employed bee phase\n        for i in range(employed_bees):\n            partner = random.choice(population[:i] + population[i+1:])\n            new_solution = modify_solution(population[i], partner, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n            new_fitness = fitness_function(cost_function(new_solution))\n\n            if new_fitness > fitness_values[i]:\n                population[i] = new_solution\n                fitness_values[i] = new_fitness\n\n        # Onlooker bee phase\n        for _ in range(onlooker_bees):\n            i = np.random.choice(range(employed_bees), p=fitness_values[:employed_bees] / np.sum(fitness_values[:employed_bees]))\n            partner = random.choice(population[:i] + population[i+1:])\n            new_solution = modify_solution(population[i], partner, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n            new_fitness = fitness_function(cost_function(new_solution))\n\n            if new_fitness > fitness_values[i]:\n                population[i] = new_solution\n                fitness_values[i] = new_fitness\n\n    best_solution = population[np.argmax(fitness_values)]\n    best_cost = cost_function(best_solution)\n\n    return best_solution, best_cost\n\n# Parameters\niterations = 100\npopulation_size = 50\nlower_bound = 100\nupper_bound = 1000\n\n# Run the ABC algorithm\nbest_x, min_cost = abc_algorithm(iterations, population_size, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n\nprint(f\"Minimum cost: {min_cost}\")\nprint(f\"Corresponding value of x: {best_x}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum cost and the corresponding value of x. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm."
