    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of $f(z)$ in the closed disk $\\overline{D(0,5)}$, we can apply the argument principle. The argument principle states that if $f(z)$ is a meromorphic function inside and on some simple closed contour $C$, and $f(z)$ has no zeros or poles on $C$, then\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\,dz = N - P,$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of zeros and $P$ is the number of poles of $f(z)$ inside $C$, counting multiplicities.\n\nIn our case, $f(z)$ is an entire function, so it has no poles. We want to find the number of zeros in the closed disk $\\overline{D(0,5)}$, so we can take $C$ to be the circle $|z|=5$. First, we need to compute $f'(z)$:\n\n$$f'(z) = 3z^2 + 2iz + 2.$$\n\nNow, we can compute the contour integral:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\,dz.$$\n\nWe parameterize the contour $C$ by $z = 5e^{it}$, where $0 \\leq t \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, $dz = 5ie^{it}dt$. The integral becomes\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{f'(5e^{it})}{f(5e^{it})} \\cdot 5ie^{it}dt.$$\n\nNow, we substitute $f(z)$ and $f'(z)$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{3(5e^{it})^2 + 2i(5e^{it}) + 2}{(5e^{it})^3 + i(5e^{it})^2 + 2(5e^{it}) - 3} \\cdot 5ie^{it}dt.$$\n\nThis integral is difficult to compute directly. However, we can use the fact that the integrand is a continuous function of $t$ and that the integral is equal to the number of zeros minus the number of poles inside the contour. Since $f(z)$ has no poles, the integral is equal to the number of zeros inside the contour.\n\nWe can use Rouche's theorem to determine the number of zeros. Rouche's theorem states that if $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic inside and on a simple closed contour $C$, and $|f(z) - g(z)| < |f(z)| + |g(z)|$ on $C$, then $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have the same number of zeros inside $C$, counting multiplicities.\n\nLet $g(z) = z^3$. Then, $|f(z) - g(z)| = |iz^2 + 2z - 3|$. On the contour $C$, $|z|=5$, so\n\n$$|iz^2 + 2z - 3| \\leq |z|^2 + 2|z| + 3 = 25 + 10 + 3 = 38.$$\n\nOn the other hand, $|g(z)| = |z^3| = 125$ on $C$. Since $38 < 125$, Rouche's theorem applies, and $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have the same number of zeros inside $C$. Since $g(z) = z^3$ has 3 zeros inside $C$ (counting multiplicities), $f(z)$ also has 3 zeros inside the closed disk $\\overline{D(0,5)}$."
