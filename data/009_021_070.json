    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation numerically, we can use the finite difference method. We will discretize the spatial domain using a grid with spacing $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$, and the time domain with a time step $\\Delta t$. We will approximate the derivatives using finite differences.\n\nFirst, let's approximate the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2 u$ using the central difference scheme:\n\n$\\nabla^2 u(x,y) \\approx \\frac{u(x+\\Delta x, y) - 2u(x,y) + u(x-\\Delta x, y)}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{u(x, y+\\Delta y) - 2u(x,y) + u(x, y-\\Delta y)}{(\\Delta y)^2}$\n\nNow, let's approximate the time derivative using the forward difference scheme:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,y,t) \\approx \\frac{u(x,y,t+\\Delta t) - u(x,y,t)}{\\Delta t}$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the PDE, we get:\n\n$\\frac{u(x,y,t+\\Delta t) - u(x,y,t)}{\\Delta t} = \\mu \\left(\\frac{u(x+\\Delta x, y,t) - 2u(x,y,t) + u(x-\\Delta x, y,t)}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{u(x, y+\\Delta y,t) - 2u(x,y,t) + u(x, y-\\Delta y,t)}{(\\Delta y)^2}\\right) + \\lambda(u(x,y,t)-1)u(x,y,t)^2$\n\nNow, we can solve for $u(x,y,t+\\Delta t)$:\n\n$u(x,y,t+\\Delta t) = u(x,y,t) + \\Delta t \\left[\\mu \\left(\\frac{u(x+\\Delta x, y,t) - 2u(x,y,t) + u(x-\\Delta x, y,t)}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{u(x, y+\\Delta y,t) - 2u(x,y,t) + u(x, y-\\Delta y,t)}{(\\Delta y)^2}\\right) + \\lambda(u(x,y,t)-1)u(x,y,t)^2\\right]$\n\nWe can use this equation to update the values of $u(x,y)$ at each time step. We will start with the initial conditions and iterate until $t = 1.0$. Note that the choice of $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta t$ will affect the accuracy and stability of the numerical solution.\n\nIt is important to mention that the explicit numerical solution provided here may require very small time steps to ensure stability. An alternative approach would be to use an implicit method, such as the Crank-Nicolson method, which can provide better stability properties.\n\nThe actual implementation of this numerical method would require writing a program or script in a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or C++. The program would create a grid for the spatial domain, initialize the values of $u(x,y,0)$ according to the given initial conditions, and then iterate through time steps to update the values of $u(x,y,t)$ using the finite difference equation derived above. Finally, the program would output the values of $u(x,y)$ at the desired time $t = 1.0$."
