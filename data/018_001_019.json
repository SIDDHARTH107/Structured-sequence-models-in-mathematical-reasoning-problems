    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of A. By definition, the empty set has no elements, so there are no elements to check. Therefore, the empty set is trivially a subset of A.\n\nFormally, let A be a set with 5 elements, and let ∅ denote the empty set. We want to show that ∅ ⊆ A. Recall the definition of a subset: B ⊆ A if and only if ∀x (x ∈ B → x ∈ A).\n\nNow, consider any element x. If x ∈ ∅, then by definition of the empty set, there is a contradiction, since the empty set has no elements. Therefore, the statement (x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A) is vacuously true for all x, as the antecedent (x ∈ ∅) is always false.\n\nSince the statement (x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A) is true for all x, we can conclude that ∅ ⊆ A."
