    "message_1": "Let X and Y be two plane curves given by the equations X: y^2 = x^3 + x^2 and Y: y = x^2 - 1. Find the number of points of intersection of X and Y in the projective plane.",
    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + x^2 (1)\ny = x^2 - 1 (2)\n\nSubstitute equation (2) into equation (1):\n\n(x^2 - 1)^2 = x^3 + x^2\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\nx^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = x^3 + x^2\nx^4 - x^3 - 3x^2 + 1 = 0 (3)\n\nNow we need to find the roots of this polynomial equation. Since it is a quartic equation, it might be difficult to find the roots directly. However, we can try to factor the equation:\n\nx^2(x^2 - x - 3) + 1(x^2 - x - 3) = 0\n(x^2 + 1)(x^2 - x - 3) = 0\n\nNow we have two quadratic equations:\n\nx^2 + 1 = 0\nx^2 - x - 3 = 0\n\nThe first equation has no real solutions, so we focus on the second equation. Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:\n\nx = (1 ± √13)/2\n\nNow we can find the corresponding y values using equation (2):\n\ny1 = ((1 + √13)/2)^2 - 1\ny2 = ((1 - √13)/2)^2 - 1\n\nSo, we have two points of intersection in the affine plane: \n\nP1 = ((1 + √13)/2, ((1 + √13)/2)^2 - 1)\nP2 = ((1 - √13)/2, ((1 - √13)/2)^2 - 1)\n\nNow we need to check for points at infinity. To do this, we homogenize the equations:\n\nY^2Z = X^3 + X^2Z (1')\nYZ^2 = X^2Z - Z^3 (2')\n\nSubstitute equation (2') into equation (1'):\n\n(X^2Z - Z^3)^2 = X^3Z + X^2Z^2\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\nX^4Z^2 - 2X^2Z^4 + Z^6 = X^3Z^2 + X^2Z^3\n\nRearrange:\n\nZ^6 - X^3Z^3 - 2X^2Z^4 + X^4Z^2 = 0\n\nFactor out Z^2:\n\nZ^2(Z^4 - X^3Z - 2X^2Z^2 + X^4) = 0\n\nSince we are looking for points at infinity, we set Z = 0:\n\nZ^4 - X^3Z - 2X^2Z^2 + X^4 = 0\n\nThis equation has no solutions for X, so there are no points at infinity.\n\nThus, there are 2 points of intersection of X and Y in the projective plane."
