    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -3.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (the part under the square root):\n\nb^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4(2)(-3) = 25 + 24 = 49\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-5 ± √49) / (2 * 2)\n\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\n2) x = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12 / 4 = -3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 1/2 and x = -3."
