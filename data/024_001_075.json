    "message_1": "A space curve C is defined by the vector function r(t) = cos(t)i + sin(t)j + t^2k. Find the curvature and torsion of the curve at t = π/4.",
    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the vector function r(t).\n\nr'(t) = -sin(t)i + cos(t)j + 2tk\nr''(t) = -cos(t)i - sin(t)j + 2k\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these derivatives at t = π/4:\n\nr'(π/4) = -sin(π/4)i + cos(π/4)j + 2(π/4)k = -√2/2 i + √2/2 j + π/2 k\nr''(π/4) = -cos(π/4)i - sin(π/4)j + 2k = -√2/2 i - √2/2 j + 2k\n\nNext, we need to find the curvature (kappa) and torsion (tau) using the following formulas:\n\nkappa = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\ntau = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product r'(t) x r''(t):\n\nr'(π/4) x r''(π/4) = \ni(√2/2 * 2 - π/2 * -√2/2) - j(-√2/2 * 2 - π/2 * -√2/2) + k(-√2/2 * -√2/2 - √2/2 * -√2/2) =\ni(√2 + π√2/2) - j(-√2 + π√2/2) + k(1)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(π/4)|| = √((-√2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2 + (π/2)^2) = √(1/2 + 1/2 + π^2/4) = √(1 + π^2/4)\n\nNow, let's find the curvature kappa:\n\nkappa = ||r'(π/4) x r''(π/4)|| / ||r'(π/4)||^3 = ||(√2 + π√2/2)i - (√2 - π√2/2)j + k|| / (√(1 + π^2/4))^3\n\nkappa = √((√2 + π√2/2)^2 + (-√2 + π√2/2)^2 + 1^2) / (1 + π^2/4)^(3/2)\n\nkappa ≈ 0.590\n\nNow, we need to find the third derivative of r(t) to calculate the torsion:\n\nr'''(t) = sin(t)i + cos(t)j\nr'''(π/4) = sin(π/4)i + cos(π/4)j = √2/2 i + √2/2 j\n\nNow, let's find the torsion tau:\n\ntau = (r'(π/4) x r''(π/4)) • r'''(π/4) / ||r'(π/4) x r''(π/4)||^2\n\ntau = ((√2 + π√2/2)i - (√2 - π√2/2)j + k) • (√2/2 i + √2/2 j) / ((√2 + π√2/2)^2 + (-√2 + π√2/2)^2 + 1^2)\n\ntau ≈ -0.390\n\nSo, the curvature kappa ≈ 0.590 and the torsion tau ≈ -0.390 at t = π/4."
