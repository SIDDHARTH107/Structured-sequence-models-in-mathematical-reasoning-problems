    "message_1": "Suppose a job candidate is interested in working for a company that values education. The company is considering offering a $5,000 signing bonus to any new hire who has a graduate degree. However, not all candidates have a graduate degree, and some candidates who do have a graduate degree may not value education as highly as the company does. Assume that the company's value for education is $\\theta \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $\\theta = 1$ indicates that the company values education highly, and $\\theta = 0$ indicates that the company does not value education highly. Further assume that the job candidate's value for education is private information known only to the candidate.\n\nSuppose a candidate has a graduate degree, and the company offers the signing bonus. What is the expected payoff from accepting the job offer for the candidate if their value for education is:\n\n- High, i.e. $\\theta = 1$\n- Low, i.e. $\\theta = 0$",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected payoff for the candidate, we need to consider the signing bonus and the candidate's value for education. Let's denote the signing bonus as B, which is $5,000 in this case.\n\n1. If the candidate's value for education is high, i.e., $\\theta = 1$:\n\nThe expected payoff for the candidate would be the sum of the signing bonus and the value they place on education. Since the candidate values education highly, their expected payoff would be:\n\nExpected payoff = B + $\\theta$ = $5,000 + 1 = $5,001\n\n2. If the candidate's value for education is low, i.e., $\\theta = 0$:\n\nIn this case, the candidate does not value education highly, so their expected payoff would only be the signing bonus:\n\nExpected payoff = B + $\\theta$ = $5,000 + 0 = $5,000\n\nSo, the expected payoff for the candidate with a high value for education is $5,001, and for the candidate with a low value for education, it is $5,000."
