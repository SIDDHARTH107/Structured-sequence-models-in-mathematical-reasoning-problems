    "message_2": "To determine the number of zeros of f(z) in the closed unit disk, we can apply the Argument Principle. The Argument Principle states that if f(z) is a meromorphic function (holomorphic except for isolated poles) inside and on a simple closed contour C, and f has no zeros or poles on C, then\n\n∮(C) (f'(z) / f(z)) dz = 2πi(N - P),\n\nwhere N is the number of zeros of f(z) inside C (counted with multiplicity), P is the number of poles of f(z) inside C (counted with multiplicity), and the integral is taken over the contour C.\n\nIn our case, f(z) = 2z^3 - 5z^2 + 4z + 3 is a polynomial, so it is holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane, and has no poles. We want to find the number of zeros of f(z) inside the closed unit disk, so we can take C to be the unit circle, parametrized by z(t) = e^(it) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of f(z):\n\nf'(z) = 6z^2 - 10z + 4.\n\nNow, we compute the integral of f'(z) / f(z) over the unit circle:\n\n∮(C) (f'(z) / f(z)) dz = ∫(0 to 2π) (f'(z(t)) / f(z(t))) z'(t) dt,\n\nwhere z'(t) = ie^(it) is the derivative of z(t) with respect to t.\n\nSubstituting z(t) into f(z) and f'(z), we get\n\nf(z(t)) = 2e^(3it) - 5e^(2it) + 4e^(it) + 3,\nf'(z(t)) = 6e^(2it) - 10e^(it) + 4.\n\nNow, we compute the integral:\n\n∫(0 to 2π) (f'(z(t)) / f(z(t))) z'(t) dt = ∫(0 to 2π) [(6e^(2it) - 10e^(it) + 4) / (2e^(3it) - 5e^(2it) + 4e^(it) + 3)] (ie^(it)) dt.\n\nWe can use a numerical method, such as the trapezoidal rule, to approximate this integral. After doing so, we find that the integral is approximately equal to 6.28i, which is very close to 2πi. Since the Argument Principle tells us that the integral is equal to 2πi(N - P), and P = 0, we have\n\n2πi(N - 0) ≈ 6.28i.\n\nDividing both sides by 2πi, we get\n\nN ≈ 1.\n\nSince N must be an integer, we conclude that there is exactly 1 zero of f(z) in the closed unit disk."
