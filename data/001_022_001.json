    "message_2": "To find the roots of the polynomial equation y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6, we need to find the values of x when y = 0.\n\n0 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6\n\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to find the possible rational roots of the polynomial. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by substituting them into the equation:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n0 = (1)^3 + 2(1)^2 - 5(1) - 6\n0 = 1 + 2 - 5 - 6\n0 ≠ -8\n\n2. For x = -1:\n0 = (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 5(-1) - 6\n0 = -1 + 2 + 5 - 6\n0 ≠ 0\n\n3. For x = 2:\n0 = (2)^3 + 2(2)^2 - 5(2) - 6\n0 = 8 + 8 - 10 - 6\n0 = 0\n\n4. For x = -2:\n0 = (-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 - 5(-2) - 6\n0 = -8 + 8 + 10 - 6\n0 ≠ 4\n\n5. For x = 3:\n0 = (3)^3 + 2(3)^2 - 5(3) - 6\n0 = 27 + 18 - 15 - 6\n0 ≠ 24\n\n6. For x = -3:\n0 = (-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 - 5(-3) - 6\n0 = -27 + 18 + 15 - 6\n0 = 0\n\n7. For x = 6:\n0 = (6)^3 + 2(6)^2 - 5(6) - 6\n0 = 216 + 72 - 30 - 6\n0 ≠ 252\n\n8. For x = -6:\n0 = (-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 - 5(-6) - 6\n0 = -216 + 72 + 30 - 6\n0 ≠ -120\n\nSo, the rational roots of the polynomial are x = 2 and x = -3. Since the polynomial is of degree 3, there is one more root, which could be irrational or complex. To find the remaining root, we can perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor.\n\nUsing synthetic division with x = 2:\n\n  2 |  1   2  -5  -6\n      |      2   8  6\n      ----------------\n          1   4   3   0\n\nThe quotient is x^2 + 4x + 3. Now, we can find the roots of this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (-4 ± √(16 - 12)) / 2\nx = (-4 ± √4) / 2\nx = (-4 ± 2) / 2\n\nThe two roots of the quadratic equation are x = -1 and x = -3. Since we already found x = -3 as a root of the original polynomial, the remaining root is x = -1.\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 are x = 2, x = -3, and x = -1.\n\nTo graph the equation on the coordinate plane, we can plot the roots and sketch the curve of the cubic function. The curve will pass through the points (2, 0), (-3, 0), and (-1, 0). Since it is a cubic function with a positive leading coefficient, the graph will start in the bottom left quadrant, pass through the roots, and end in the top right quadrant."
