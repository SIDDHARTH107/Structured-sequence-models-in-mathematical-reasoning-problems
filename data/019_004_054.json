Suppose that we have a temporal model with three states $s_0$, $s_1$, and $s_2$ such that:\n\n- $s_0$ is the initial state;\n- $s_0$ has a self-loop labelled with $\\neg \\mathbf{p}$;\n- $s_1$ has a loop to itself labelled with $\\neg \\mathbf{p}$, and a transition to $s_2$ labelled with $\\mathbf{p}$;\n- $s_2$ has a loop to itself labelled with $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nWhat is the truth value of $\\mathbf{AG}\\ \\mathbf{p}$ in this model?",
    "message_2": "The formula $\\mathbf{AG}\\ \\mathbf{p}$ is a temporal logic formula that states that the proposition $\\mathbf{p}$ is true in all reachable states along all paths in the model. In other words, it asserts that $\\mathbf{p}$ is globally true.\n\nIn the given temporal model, we have three states: $s_0$, $s_1$, and $s_2$. Let's analyze the truth value of $\\mathbf{p}$ in each state:\n\n1. In state $s_0$, the self-loop is labelled with $\\neg \\mathbf{p}$, which means that $\\mathbf{p}$ is false in this state.\n2. In state $s_1$, the self-loop is labelled with $\\neg \\mathbf{p}$, which means that $\\mathbf{p}$ is false in this state as well.\n3. In state $s_2$, the self-loop is labelled with $\\mathbf{p}$, which means that $\\mathbf{p}$ is true in this state.\n\nSince $\\mathbf{p}$ is false in states $s_0$ and $s_1$, the formula $\\mathbf{AG}\\ \\mathbf{p}$ is not true in this model. The truth value of $\\mathbf{AG}\\ \\mathbf{p}$ in this model is false."
