    "message_2": "To evaluate the contour integral, we will use the Cauchy's integral formula. The Cauchy's integral formula states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, and for any point a inside C:\n\n$$\\int_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz = 2\\pi i f(a)$$\n\nIn our case, the function $f(z) = 2z$ and the point $a = 1$. Since the function $f(z)$ is analytic inside and on the unit circle, we can apply the Cauchy's integral formula. First, we need to find the value of the function at the point $a$:\n\n$$f(a) = f(1) = 2(1) = 2$$\n\nNow, we can apply the Cauchy's integral formula:\n\n$$\\int_C \\frac{2z}{(z-1)^2} dz = 2\\pi i f(1) = 2\\pi i (2) = 4\\pi i$$\n\nSo, the value of the contour integral is $4\\pi i$."
