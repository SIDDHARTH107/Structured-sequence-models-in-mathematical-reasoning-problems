    "message_1": "Consider the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x. Use the cuckoo search algorithm to find the minimum value of this function within the range [1, 3]. Use a population of 20 cuckoo birds and allow a maximum of 100 iterations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of 20 cuckoo birds with random positions (x values) within the range [1, 3].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each bird (i.e., the value of f(x) for each bird's position).\n3. Perform the following steps for 100 iterations:\n   a. Choose a random cuckoo bird and generate a new solution (position) using a random walk.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. Choose a random bird from the population and compare its fitness with the new solution's fitness. If the new solution is better (i.e., has a lower f(x) value), replace the chosen bird's position with the new solution.\n   d. With a certain probability, perform a local search by choosing the best solution so far and generating new solutions around it.\n   e. Update the best solution found so far if a better one is found during the local search.\n4. Return the best solution found after 100 iterations.\n\nPlease note that as an AI language model, I cannot execute code or perform calculations. However, I can provide you with a Python code snippet that you can run to perform the cuckoo search algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 2 * x**3 - 3 * x**2 - 12 * x\n\ndef random_walk(x):\n    return x + np.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)\n\ndef cuckoo_search(iterations, population_size, search_range):\n    population = np.random.uniform(search_range[0], search_range[1], population_size)\n    fitness = f(population)\n    best_solution = population[np.argmin(fitness)]\n    \n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        cuckoo_idx = np.random.randint(population_size)\n        new_solution = random_walk(population[cuckoo_idx])\n        new_fitness = f(new_solution)\n        \n        random_bird_idx = np.random.randint(population_size)\n        if new_fitness < fitness[random_bird_idx]:\n            population[random_bird_idx] = new_solution\n            fitness[random_bird_idx] = new_fitness\n            \n            if new_fitness < f(best_solution):\n                best_solution = new_solution\n                \n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\nbest_solution, min_value = cuckoo_search(100, 20, [1, 3])\nprint(f\"Minimum value found: {min_value} at x = {best_solution}\")\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a Python environment to find the minimum value of the function within the specified range using the cuckoo search algorithm. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm."
