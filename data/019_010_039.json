    "message_2": "In linear logic, the contraction rule allows you to combine two instances of the same proposition into one. Applying the contraction rule to the formula A ⊗ B ⊗ A ⊸ C, we can combine the two instances of A:\n\n(A ⊗ A) ⊗ B ⊸ C\n\nAfter applying the contraction rule, the resulting formula is:\n\nA ⊗ B ⊸ C"
