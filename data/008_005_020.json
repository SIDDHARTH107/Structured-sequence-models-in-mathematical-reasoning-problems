    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 3 -4  5 | -1 |\n| 5 -2  3 |  2 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 3*R1\nR3 = R3 - 5*R1\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 0 -10  8 | -10 |\n| 0 -12  8 | -13 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 1.2*R2\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 0 -10  8 | -10 |\n| 0  0  0 |  1 |\n\nAt this point, we see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 1, which is a contradiction. This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution."
