Use the given statement to determine the isomorphism type of the group G where G = {e, a, b, c, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l} and the operation * is defined as follows:\n\na*a=b, b*a=a*b=d, c*a=a*c=g, d*a=h*a=h, f*a=h*b=i, g*a=h*c=j, h*a=h, i*a=k, j*a=l, k*a=g, l*a=f.",
    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphism type of the group G, we will first examine the properties of the given elements and the operation *.\n\n1. Identity element: Since G is a group, there must be an identity element e such that e*x = x*e = x for all x in G. In this case, e is given explicitly.\n\n2. Inverses: For each element x in G, there must exist an element y in G such that x*y = y*x = e. We can find the inverses of the elements as follows:\n\na: a*a = b, so a is its own inverse.\nb: b*a = d, so b's inverse is d.\nc: c*a = g, so c's inverse is g.\nd: d*a = h*a = h, so d's inverse is h.\nf: f*a = h*b = i, so f's inverse is i.\ng: g*a = h*c = j, so g's inverse is j.\nh: h*a = h, so h is its own inverse.\ni: i*a = k, so i's inverse is k.\nj: j*a = l, so j's inverse is l.\nk: k*a = g, so k's inverse is g.\nl: l*a = f, so l's inverse is f.\n\n3. Order of elements: The order of an element x in G is the smallest positive integer n such that x^n = e. We can find the orders of the elements as follows:\n\na: a^2 = b, a^3 = a*b = d, a^4 = d*a = h, a^5 = h*a = h, a^6 = e. So, the order of a is 6.\nb: b^2 = d, b^3 = d*b = h, b^4 = h*b = i, b^5 = i*b = k, b^6 = k*b = g, b^7 = g*b = j, b^8 = j*b = l, b^9 = l*b = f, b^10 = f*b = h, b^11 = h*b = i, b^12 = i*b = k, b^13 = k*b = g, b^14 = g*b = j, b^15 = j*b = l, b^16 = l*b = f, b^17 = f*b = h, b^18 = e. So, the order of b is 18.\nc: c^2 = g, c^3 = g*c = j, c^4 = j*c = l, c^5 = l*c = f, c^6 = f*c = h, c^7 = e. So, the order of c is 7.\nd: d^2 = h, d^3 = h*d = h, d^4 = e. So, the order of d is 4.\nf: f^2 = i, f^3 = i*f = k, f^4 = k*f = g, f^5 = g*f = j, f^6 = j*f = l, f^7 = l*f = f, f^8 = f*f = i, f^9 = i*f = k, f^10 = k*f = g, f^11 = g*f = j, f^12 = j*f = l, f^13 = l*f = f, f^14 = f*f = i, f^15 = i*f = k, f^16 = k*f = g, f^17 = g*f = j, f^18 = j*f = l, f^19 = e. So, the order of f is 19.\ng: g^2 = j, g^3 = j*g = l, g^4 = l*g = f, g^5 = f*g = h, g^6 = e. So, the order of g is 6.\nh: h^2 = e. So, the order of h is 2.\ni: i^2 = k, i^3 = k*i = g, i^4 = g*i = j, i^5 = j*i = l, i^6 = l*i = f, i^7 = f*i = h, i^8 = e. So, the order of i is 8.\nj: j^2 = l, j^3 = l*j = f, j^4 = f*j = h, j^5 = e. So, the order of j is 5.\nk: k^2 = g, k^3 = g*k = j, k^4 = j*k = l, k^5 = l*k = f, k^6 = f*k = h, k^7 = e. So, the order of k is 7.\nl: l^2 = f, l^3 = f*l = h, l^4 = e. So, the order of l is 4.\n\nNow, we will analyze the structure of G based on the orders of its elements:\n\n- There is an element of order 6 (a), which means G has a cyclic subgroup of order 6.\n- There are elements of order 2 (h), 4 (d, l), 5 (j), 7 (c, k), and 19 (f). However, since the order of G is 12, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide 12. Therefore, the orders 5, 7, and 19 are not possible for any element in G, which means there is an inconsistency in the given operation *.\n\nDue to this inconsistency, we cannot determine the isomorphism type of the group G based on the given operation *."
