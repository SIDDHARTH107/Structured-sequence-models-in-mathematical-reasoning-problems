    "message_2": "To approximate y(0.2) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.1, we will perform one iteration of the method. Let's denote the function y'(x, y) as f(x, y) = x + y.\n\nGiven the initial value problem y'(x, y) = x + y, y(0) = 1, we have:\n\nx0 = 0\ny0 = 1\nh = 0.1\n\nNow, we will calculate the four coefficients k1, k2, k3, and k4:\n\nk1 = f(x0, y0) = f(0, 1) = 0 + 1 = 1\nk2 = f(x0 + h/2, y0 + h*k1/2) = f(0 + 0.1/2, 1 + 0.1*1/2) = f(0.05, 1.05) = 0.05 + 1.05 = 1.1\nk3 = f(x0 + h/2, y0 + h*k2/2) = f(0 + 0.1/2, 1 + 0.1*1.1/2) = f(0.05, 1.055) = 0.05 + 1.055 = 1.105\nk4 = f(x0 + h, y0 + h*k3) = f(0 + 0.1, 1 + 0.1*1.105) = f(0.1, 1.1105) = 0.1 + 1.1105 = 1.2105\n\nNow, we will update the value of y using the weighted average of these four coefficients:\n\ny1 = y0 + h*(k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6 = 1 + 0.1*(1 + 2*1.1 + 2*1.105 + 1.2105)/6 = 1 + 0.1*(6.631)/6 = 1.1105166667\n\nSo, the approximate value of y(0.2) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.1 is y1 = 1.1105166667."
