    "message_1": "Suppose you have a sample of radioactive material with an initial mass of 100 grams. The half-life of the material is 10 days. \n\na) Write an equation that models the amount of material remaining after t days.\nb) How much material would remain after 20 days?\nc) How long will it take for the sample to decay to 25 grams?",
    "message_2": "a) The equation that models the amount of material remaining after t days is given by the exponential decay formula:\n\nA(t) = A₀ * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere A(t) is the amount of material remaining after t days, A₀ is the initial mass of the material, t is the time in days, and T is the half-life of the material.\n\nIn this case, A₀ = 100 grams and T = 10 days. So the equation becomes:\n\nA(t) = 100 * (1/2)^(t/10)\n\nb) To find the amount of material remaining after 20 days, plug t = 20 into the equation:\n\nA(20) = 100 * (1/2)^(20/10)\nA(20) = 100 * (1/2)^2\nA(20) = 100 * (1/4)\nA(20) = 25 grams\n\nSo, 25 grams of material would remain after 20 days.\n\nc) To find how long it will take for the sample to decay to 25 grams, set A(t) = 25 and solve for t:\n\n25 = 100 * (1/2)^(t/10)\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(t/10)\n\nTake the logarithm of both sides with base (1/2):\n\nlog_(1/2)(0.25) = log_(1/2)((1/2)^(t/10))\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that log_b(b^x) = x:\n\n2 = t/10\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 10:\n\nt = 20 days\n\nSo, it will take 20 days for the sample to decay to 25 grams."
