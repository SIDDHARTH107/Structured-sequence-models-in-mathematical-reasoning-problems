    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the gaps between three mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. The curvatures of the circles in an Apollonian gasket follow a specific rule called the Descartes Circle Theorem. Given three circles with curvatures k1, k2, and k3, the curvature of the fourth circle that is tangent to all three can be found using the formula:\n\nk4 = k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nIn this case, the starting circles have curvatures 1, 2, and 3. We can find the curvatures of the next two circles using the formula:\n\nk4 = 1 + 2 + 3 ± 2 * sqrt(1 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 1)\nk4 = 6 ± 2 * sqrt(11)\n\nSo, the curvatures of the next two circles are 6 + 2 * sqrt(11) and 6 - 2 * sqrt(11).\n\nThe sum of the curvatures of the circles in an Apollonian gasket is infinite, as the gasket contains an infinite number of circles. However, we can find the sum of the curvatures of the first five circles (the three starting circles and the two new circles):\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + (6 + 2 * sqrt(11)) + (6 - 2 * sqrt(11)) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 18\n\nSo, the sum of the curvatures of the first five circles in the Apollonian gasket is 18."
