    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function (fog)(x) = f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. In other words, (fog)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x):\n\nf(x) = cos(3x)\nf'(x) = -3sin(3x) (derivative of cos(ax) is -asin(ax))\n\ng(x) = x^2 - 5\ng'(x) = 2x (derivative of x^2 is 2x, and the derivative of a constant is 0)\n\nNow, we will apply the chain rule:\n\n(fog)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n= -3sin(3(g(x))) * 2x\n= -3sin(3(x^2 - 5)) * 2x\n\nSo, (fog)'(x) = -6xsin(3(x^2 - 5))."
