    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting exactly three heads when flipping a fair coin five times, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (heads), and p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin).\n\nIn this case, n = 5, k = 3, and p = 0.5.\n\nFirst, we calculate \"n choose k\", which is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials:\n\n5 choose 3 = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10\n\nNow, we plug the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^(5-3) = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25 = 0.3125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly three heads when flipping a fair coin five times is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
