    "message_1": "Consider a European call option on a non-dividend paying stock with a strike price of $50$, which expires in $90$ days. The current stock price is $55$, and the risk-free interest rate is $4\\%$. \n\nAssuming that the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion, find the value of the option using the Black-Scholes equation.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need the following parameters:\n\n1. Current stock price (S): $55\n2. Strike price (K): $50\n3. Time to expiration (T): 90 days or 90/365 = 0.246575 years (assuming 365 days in a year)\n4. Risk-free interest rate (r): 4% or 0.04\n5. Volatility (σ): This parameter is not provided, so we will assume a value for it. Let's assume σ = 0.20 (20% annualized volatility).\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the call option value:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = Call option value\nN(x) = Cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(55/50) + (0.04 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.246575) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.246575))\nd1 ≈ 0.4736\n\nd2 = 0.4736 - 0.20 * sqrt(0.246575)\nd2 ≈ 0.2736\n\nNow, we need to find the cumulative distribution function values N(d1) and N(d2):\n\nN(0.4736) ≈ 0.6821\nN(0.2736) ≈ 0.6071\n\nFinally, we can calculate the call option value:\n\nC = 55 * 0.6821 - 50 * e^(-0.04 * 0.246575) * 0.6071\nC ≈ 55 * 0.6821 - 50 * 0.9901 * 0.6071\nC ≈ 37.5155 - 29.9565\nC ≈ 7.559\n\nSo, the value of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation is approximately $7.56. Note that the value may change depending on the assumed volatility (σ)."
