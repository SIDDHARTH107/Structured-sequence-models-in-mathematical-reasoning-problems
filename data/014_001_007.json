    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using RSA encryption, we need to use the public key (e, n) provided. In this case, e = 5 and n = 35. The message we want to send is the number 8.\n\nEncryption:\nCiphertext (C) = (Message (M) ^ e) mod n\nC = (8 ^ 5) mod 35\n\nCalculating 8^5:\n8^5 = 32,768\n\nNow, we'll find the result modulo 35:\nC = 32,768 mod 35 = 18\n\nSo, the encrypted message (ciphertext) is 18.\n\nNow, let's move on to the decryption process. To decrypt the message, we need to find the private key (d, n). We already have n = 35, but we need to find d. To do that, we need to find the factors of n (p and q) and calculate the totient function of n (phi(n)).\n\nSince n = 35, the factors are p = 5 and q = 7.\n\nNow, we'll calculate phi(n):\nphi(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\nphi(35) = (5 - 1) * (7 - 1) = 4 * 6 = 24\n\nNext, we need to find d such that (d * e) mod phi(n) = 1:\n(d * 5) mod 24 = 1\n\nBy trying different values for d, we find that d = 5 satisfies this equation:\n(5 * 5) mod 24 = 25 mod 24 = 1\n\nSo, the private key is (d, n) = (5, 35).\n\nNow, we can decrypt the ciphertext (C) using the private key:\n\nDecrypted Message (M) = (Ciphertext (C) ^ d) mod n\nM = (18 ^ 5) mod 35\n\nCalculating 18^5:\n18^5 = 1,889,568\n\nNow, we'll find the result modulo 35:\nM = 1,889,568 mod 35 = 8\n\nThe decrypted message is 8, which is the original message we wanted to send."
