    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, Player A proposes a division of $100 between themself and Player B. If Player B accepts, the money is divided as proposed. However, if Player B rejects, both players get nothing. What is the minimum amount Player A should offer to ensure that Player B accepts the proposal?",
    "message_2": "In the ultimatum game, the minimum amount Player A should offer to ensure that Player B accepts the proposal is $1. This is because if Player B rejects the offer, they will get nothing, so accepting $1 is still better than getting nothing. However, this assumes that both players are rational and focused on maximizing their own monetary gains. In reality, people may have different preferences and may reject offers they perceive as unfair, even if it means getting nothing."
