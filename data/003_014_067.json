    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 2cos(3x) - 3sin(4x), we need to analyze the individual trigonometric functions and their coefficients.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a trigonometric function is the absolute value of its coefficient. In this case, the amplitudes of the individual functions are:\n\nAmplitude of 2cos(3x): |2| = 2\nAmplitude of -3sin(4x): |-3| = 3\n\nHowever, the amplitude of the combined function f(x) cannot be directly determined as the sum or difference of the individual amplitudes, since the two functions have different periods and are not in phase. In this case, we can only find the individual amplitudes, but not the overall amplitude of f(x).\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a trigonometric function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. For cosine and sine functions, the period can be found using the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nwhere B is the coefficient of x inside the trigonometric function.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = 2cos(3x) - 3sin(4x), we have:\n\nPeriod of 2cos(3x): (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3\nPeriod of -3sin(4x): (2π) / |4| = (2π) / 4 = π / 2\n\nTo find the period of the combined function f(x), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods:\n\nLCM[(2π) / 3, π / 2]\n\nTo find the LCM, we can first find the LCM of the denominators (3 and 2):\n\nLCM[3, 2] = 6\n\nNow, we can express the periods with the common denominator:\n\n(2π) / 3 = (4π) / 6\nπ / 2 = (3π) / 6\n\nSince the numerators (4π and 3π) do not have any common factors other than π, the LCM of the periods is:\n\nLCM[(4π) / 6, (3π) / 6] = (12π) / 6\n\nSo, the period of the function f(x) = 2cos(3x) - 3sin(4x) is:\n\nPeriod = (12π) / 6 = 2π\n\nIn summary, the individual amplitudes are 2 and 3, but the overall amplitude of f(x) cannot be directly determined. The period of f(x) is 2π."
