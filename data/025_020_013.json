    "message_2": "To determine the number of rational curves of degree 3 in X passing through two points in general position, we can use the technique of intersection theory and the deformation theory of rational curves.\n\nLet C be a rational curve of degree 3 in X. The normal bundle of C in X, denoted by N_C/X, is a rank 2 vector bundle on C. By the adjunction formula, we have:\n\nK_C = (K_X + C)|_C,\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical divisor of X and K_C is the canonical divisor of C. Since X is a Calabi-Yau threefold, K_X = 0. Thus, K_C = C|_C.\n\nNow, we know that C is a rational curve of degree 3, so it is isomorphic to P^1 and its canonical divisor is K_C = -2. Therefore, C|_C = -2. This implies that C intersects itself with multiplicity -2.\n\nBy deformation theory, the number of rational curves of degree 3 in X passing through two points in general position is given by the Euler characteristic of the normal bundle N_C/X:\n\nχ(N_C/X) = h^0(N_C/X) - h^1(N_C/X) + h^2(N_C/X).\n\nSince C is a rational curve, we have h^1(N_C/X) = 0. Moreover, by the Riemann-Roch theorem for the curve C, we have:\n\nχ(N_C/X) = deg(N_C/X) + 1 - g(C),\n\nwhere deg(N_C/X) is the degree of the normal bundle and g(C) is the genus of C. Since C is a rational curve, g(C) = 0. Thus, we need to compute the degree of the normal bundle N_C/X.\n\nThe degree of N_C/X can be computed using the intersection product:\n\ndeg(N_C/X) = C^3 + 2C^2 · H,\n\nwhere H is the hyperplane class in X. Since C|_C = -2, we have C^3 = (-2)^3 = -8. Moreover, since C is a rational curve of degree 3, we have C = 3H, so C^2 · H = (3H)^2 · H = 9H^3. The intersection number H^3 can be computed using the equation of X:\n\nH^3 = (1/3!)(3^3) = 9.\n\nThus, deg(N_C/X) = -8 + 2(9) = 10. Therefore, the number of rational curves of degree 3 in X passing through two points in general position is given by:\n\nχ(N_C/X) = 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nSo, there are 11 rational curves of degree 3 in X passing through two points in general position."
