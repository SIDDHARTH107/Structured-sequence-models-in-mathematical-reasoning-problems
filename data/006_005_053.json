    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the math student:\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected person will be born on New Year's Day between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM? Given that there are 365 days in a year and assuming that the distribution of birth dates is uniform, calculate the probability of someone being born on January 1.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of someone being born on January 1, we can simply divide the number of successful outcomes (being born on January 1) by the total number of possible outcomes (the number of days in a year).\n\nThere is only 1 successful outcome (being born on January 1) and 365 possible outcomes (the number of days in a year). So, the probability is:\n\nP(Born on January 1) = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nP(Born on January 1) = 1 / 365\n\nThe probability of someone being born on January 1 is 1/365, which is approximately 0.00274 or 0.274% when expressed as a percentage."
