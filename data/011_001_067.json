    "message_2": "To choose a committee of 3 members from a group of 8 people, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (8 in this case), k is the number of people we want to choose (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8, 3) = (336) / (6)\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose a committee of 3 members from a group of 8 people."
