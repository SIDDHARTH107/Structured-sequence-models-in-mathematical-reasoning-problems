    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinatorics. We will first find the total number of ways to choose four different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 10} and then subtract the number of ways in which two consecutive integers are chosen.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose four different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 10} is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (the number of elements in the set) and k = 4 (the number of integers we want to choose).\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!) = 10! / (4!6!) = 210\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways in which two consecutive integers are chosen. We can do this by considering the number of ways to choose three non-consecutive integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 8} and then adding one to each of these integers. This will give us a set of four integers with two consecutive integers.\n\nThe number of ways to choose three non-consecutive integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 8} is given by:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = 56\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose four different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 10} without selecting any two consecutive integers in the same choice is:\n\n210 - 56 = 154\n\nTherefore, there are 154 ways to choose four different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 10} without selecting any two consecutive integers in the same choice."
