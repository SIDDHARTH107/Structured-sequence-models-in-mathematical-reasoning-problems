    "message_1": "A train starts moving from station A at 60 km/hr towards station B. After 30 minutes, another train starts moving from station B at 90 km/hr towards station A. If the distance between the two stations is 240 kilometers, how long will it take for the two trains to meet? (Use temporal logic to solve the problem.)",
    "message_2": "Let t be the time (in hours) it takes for the two trains to meet after the second train starts moving. \n\nIn the first 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the first train covers a distance of 60 km/hr * 0.5 hr = 30 km. \n\nNow, the remaining distance between the two trains is 240 km - 30 km = 210 km.\n\nWhen the two trains are moving towards each other, their speeds are added. So, the relative speed of the two trains is 60 km/hr + 90 km/hr = 150 km/hr.\n\nNow, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time\n\n210 km = 150 km/hr * t\n\nTo find the time t, we can divide both sides by 150 km/hr:\n\nt = 210 km / 150 km/hr = 1.4 hours\n\nSince the second train started 0.5 hours after the first train, the total time it takes for the two trains to meet after the first train starts moving is:\n\n1.4 hours + 0.5 hours = 1.9 hours."
