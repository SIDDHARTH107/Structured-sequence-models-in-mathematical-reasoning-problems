QR decomposition is a technique where matrix A is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R.\n\n1. Find the orthonormal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = (2, 4, 1)\nv1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (2/sqrt(21), 4/sqrt(21), 1/sqrt(21))\n\nu2 = (1, 2, -3) - proj_v1(1, 2, -3) = (-1/7, 0, -20/7)\nv2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (-1/sqrt(401), 0, -20/sqrt(401))\n\nu3 = (3, 1, 2) - proj_v1(3, 1, 2) - proj_v2(3, 1, 2) = (0, 1, 0)\nv3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (0, 1, 0)\n\n2.
