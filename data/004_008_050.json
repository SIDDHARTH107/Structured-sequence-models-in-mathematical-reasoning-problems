    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3 at the point (2, 29), we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = d(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 6x^2 + 10x\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 6(2)^2 + 10(2) = 6(4) + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3 at the point (2, 29) is 44."
