    "message_2": "Let's first find the total number of ways to form a committee of 4 people from a group of 10 members without any restrictions. This can be calculated using combinations, which is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of members, r is the number of members to be selected, and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and r = 4. So, the total number of ways without any restrictions is:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!) = 10! / (4!6!) = 210\n\nNow, let's consider the restriction that one member refuses to work with another particular member. We can think of this as selecting a committee of 4 people that includes both of these members. There are 8 other members to choose from, and we need to select 2 more to complete the committee of 4 people.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is:\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = 28\n\nThese 28 ways are the \"forbidden\" combinations, as they include both members who refuse to work together. To find the number of ways to form a committee without these forbidden combinations, we subtract them from the total number of ways without any restrictions:\n\n210 (total ways) - 28 (forbidden ways) = 182\n\nSo, there are 182 ways to form a committee of 4 people from a group of 10 members with the given restriction."
