    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the sample mean for X and Y.\n\nMean of X (X̄) = (1 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 4) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3\nMean of Y (Ȳ) = (5 + 9 + 7 + 6 + 8) / 5 = 35 / 5 = 7\n\nNow, let's calculate the sample standard deviation for X and Y.\n\nSample variance of X (s²x) = Σ(Xi - X̄)² / (n - 1) = ((1-3)² + (5-3)² + (3-3)² + (2-3)² + (4-3)²) / (5 - 1) = (4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\nSample standard deviation of X (sx) = √s²x = √2.5 ≈ 1.58\n\nSample variance of Y (s²y) = Σ(Yi - Ȳ)² / (n - 1) = ((5-7)² + (9-7)² + (7-7)² + (6-7)² + (8-7)²) / (5 - 1) = (4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\nSample standard deviation of Y (sy) = √s²y = √2.5 ≈ 1.58\n\nNext, let's calculate the sample covariance between X and Y.\n\nSample covariance (sxy) = Σ(Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ) / (n - 1) = ((1-3)(5-7) + (5-3)(9-7) + (3-3)(7-7) + (2-3)(6-7) + (4-3)(8-7)) / 4 = (4 + 4 + 0 - 1 + 1) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2\n\nFinally, let's calculate the sample correlation coefficient between X and Y.\n\nSample correlation coefficient (r) = sxy / (sx * sy) = 2 / (1.58 * 1.58) ≈ 2 / 2.4964 ≈ 0.801\n\nSo, the sample mean for X is 3, the sample mean for Y is 7, the sample standard deviation for X is approximately 1.58, the sample standard deviation for Y is approximately 1.58, the sample covariance between X and Y is 2, and the sample correlation coefficient between X and Y is approximately 0.801."
