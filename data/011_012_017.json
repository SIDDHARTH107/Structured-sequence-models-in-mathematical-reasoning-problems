    "message_1": "A math student needs to invite guests to a party. They have a list of 25 friends, 12 of which play basketball and 10 of which play volleyball. If they want to invite at least one basketball player and at least one volleyball player, how many guest lists can they make if they are inviting a total of 15 friends?",
    "message_2": "Let's break this problem down into cases.\n\nCase 1: The student invites 1 basketball player and 14 volleyball players.\nThere are 12 ways to choose 1 basketball player and 10 ways to choose 1 volleyball player. However, since the student can only invite 15 friends in total, and there are only 10 volleyball players, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: The student invites 2 basketball players and 13 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 2) ways to choose 2 basketball players and 10 ways to choose 1 volleyball player. However, since the student can only invite 15 friends in total, and there are only 10 volleyball players, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 3: The student invites 3 basketball players and 12 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 3) ways to choose 3 basketball players and C(10, 2) ways to choose 2 volleyball players. However, since the student can only invite 15 friends in total, and there are only 10 volleyball players, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 4: The student invites 4 basketball players and 11 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 4) ways to choose 4 basketball players and C(10, 1) ways to choose 1 volleyball player. However, since the student can only invite 15 friends in total, and there are only 10 volleyball players, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 5: The student invites 5 basketball players and 10 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 5) ways to choose 5 basketball players and C(10, 0) ways to choose 0 volleyball players. However, since the student wants to invite at least one volleyball player, this case is not possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where the student invites more basketball players and fewer volleyball players.\n\nCase 6: The student invites 6 basketball players and 9 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 6) ways to choose 6 basketball players and C(10, 9) ways to choose 9 volleyball players.\n\nCase 7: The student invites 7 basketball players and 8 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 7) ways to choose 7 basketball players and C(10, 8) ways to choose 8 volleyball players.\n\nCase 8: The student invites 8 basketball players and 7 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 8) ways to choose 8 basketball players and C(10, 7) ways to choose 7 volleyball players.\n\nCase 9: The student invites 9 basketball players and 6 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 9) ways to choose 9 basketball players and C(10, 6) ways to choose 6 volleyball players.\n\nCase 10: The student invites 10 basketball players and 5 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 10) ways to choose 10 basketball players and C(10, 5) ways to choose 5 volleyball players.\n\nCase 11: The student invites 11 basketball players and 4 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 11) ways to choose 11 basketball players and C(10, 4) ways to choose 4 volleyball players.\n\nCase 12: The student invites 12 basketball players and 3 volleyball players.\nThere are C(12, 12) ways to choose 12 basketball players and C(10, 3) ways to choose 3 volleyball players.\n\nNow, let's add up the number of guest lists for each valid case:\n\nCase 6: C(12, 6) * C(10, 9) = 924 * 10 = 9240\nCase 7: C(12, 7) * C(10, 8) = 792 * 45 = 35640\nCase 8: C(12, 8) * C(10, 7) = 495 * 120 = 59400\nCase 9: C(12, 9) * C(10, 6) = 220 * 210 = 46200\nCase 10: C(12, 10) * C(10, 5) = 66 * 252 = 16632\nCase 11: C(12, 11) * C(10, 4) = 12 * 210 = 2520\nCase 12: C(12, 12) * C(10, 3) = 1 * 120 = 120\n\nTotal guest lists = 9240 + 35640 + 59400 + 46200 + 16632 + 2520 + 120 = 170752\n\nSo, there are 170,752 possible guest lists that the student can make with the given conditions."
