    "message_2": "The first non-zero coefficient in the Floer homology of the three-dimensional lens space L(p, q) with p and q relatively prime integers and p > 1 can be determined by examining the Heegaard Floer homology of the space. \n\nIn the case of lens spaces, the Heegaard Floer homology is known to be isomorphic to the singular homology of the lens space. Specifically, the Heegaard Floer homology of L(p, q) is given by:\n\nHF(L(p, q)) = Z^p\n\nwhere Z denotes the integers.\n\nThe first non-zero coefficient in the Floer homology corresponds to the rank of the first non-trivial homology group. In this case, the first non-zero coefficient is 1, as the rank of the first non-trivial homology group is 1."
