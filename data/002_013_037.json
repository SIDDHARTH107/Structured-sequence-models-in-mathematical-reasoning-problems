    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm at the base, and a height of 10 cm. Calculate the volume of the rectangular pyramid in cubic centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid is the product of its length and width:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width = 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm²\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height = (1/3) * 24 cm² * 10 cm = (1/3) * 240 cm³ = 80 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 80 cubic centimeters."
