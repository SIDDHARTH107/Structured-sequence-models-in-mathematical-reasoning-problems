So,\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4, 6}\n\nNow, let's show that A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be in A. We can see that 2, 4, and 6 are all in set A:\n\n2 ∈ A, 4 ∈ A, and 6 ∈ A\n\nTherefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow, let's show that A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be in B.
