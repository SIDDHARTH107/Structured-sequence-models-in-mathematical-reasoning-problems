The educator collected the following data:\n\n- Group A: 85, 87, 88, 89, 90\n- Group B: 84, 82, 86, 78, 92\n- Group C: 79, 81, 83, 80, 78\n\nUsing a significance level of α = 0.05, can the educator conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of the three groups?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the mean scores of the three groups, we can perform a one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference in the mean scores of the three groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant difference in the mean scores of the three groups.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean scores for each group:\n\nGroup A: (85 + 87 + 88 + 89 + 90) / 5 = 87.8\nGroup B: (84 + 82 + 86 + 78 + 92) / 5 = 84.4\nGroup C: (79 + 81 + 83 + 80 + 78) / 5 = 80.2\n\nNext, we need to calculate the overall mean score (Grand Mean):\n\nGrand Mean = (87.8 + 84.4 + 80.2) / 3 = 84.1333\n\nNow, we calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB), Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW), and Total Sum of Squares (SST):\n\nSSB = Σ(n * (mean_group - grand_mean)^2)\nSSB = 5 * (87.8 - 84.1333)^2 + 5 * (84.4 - 84.1333)^2 + 5 * (80.2 - 84.1333)^2 = 179.7333\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - mean_group)^2\nGroup A SSW = (85-87.8)^2 + (87-87.8)^2 + (88-87.8)^2 + (89-87.8)^2 + (90-87.8)^2 = 22\nGroup B SSW = (84-84.4)^2 + (82-84.4)^2 + (86-84.4)^2 + (78-84.4)^2 + (92-84.4)^2 = 180\nGroup C SSW = (79-80.2)^2 + (81-80.2)^2 + (83-80.2)^2 + (80-80.2)^2 + (78-80.2)^2 = 18\nSSW = 22 + 180 + 18 = 220\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 179.7333 + 220 = 399.7333\n\nNow, we calculate the Mean Squares Between Groups (MSB) and Mean Squares Within Groups (MSW):\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1) = 179.7333 / (3 - 1) = 89.8667\nMSW = SSW / (N - k) = 220 / (15 - 3) = 18.3333\n\nNext, we calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 89.8667 / 18.3333 = 4.9029\n\nNow, we need to find the critical F-value for a significance level of α = 0.05. We have k = 3 groups and N = 15 total observations, so we have (k - 1) = 2 degrees of freedom for the numerator and (N - k) = 12 degrees of freedom for the denominator. Using an F-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical F-value:\n\nF_critical = F(2, 12, 0.05) = 3.8853\n\nFinally, we compare the F-statistic to the critical F-value:\n\nF = 4.9029 > F_critical = 3.8853\n\nSince the F-statistic is greater than the critical F-value, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of the three groups at a significance level of α = 0.05."
