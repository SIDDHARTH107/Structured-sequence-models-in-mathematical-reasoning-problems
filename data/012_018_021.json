    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices where the edge connectivity between vertices 1 and 5 is of interest. If we remove 3 edges, the graph becomes disconnected. What is the edge connectivity between vertices 1 and 5?",
    "message_2": "The edge connectivity between two vertices in a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the two vertices. In this case, it is given that after removing 3 edges, the graph becomes disconnected. Therefore, the edge connectivity between vertices 1 and 5 is 3."
