    "message_1": "A company wants to transport products from one warehouse to another using trucks. There are three possible routes, each with different maximum capacities (in tons) and transportation costs (per ton):\n\nRoute 1: Maximum capacity of 5 tons, transportation cost of $10 per ton\nRoute 2: Maximum capacity of 8 tons, transportation cost of $8 per ton\nRoute 3: Maximum capacity of 7 tons, transportation cost of $9 per ton\n\nHow many tons of products should be transported on each route to minimize the total transportation cost while ensuring that no route exceeds its maximum capacity?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total transportation cost, we should prioritize using the route with the lowest transportation cost per ton. In this case, Route 2 has the lowest cost at $8 per ton. \n\nLet's denote the amount of products transported on each route as x1, x2, and x3 for Routes 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nFirst, we will use Route 2 to its maximum capacity:\nx2 = 8 tons\n\nNext, we will compare the remaining two routes. Route 3 has a lower transportation cost per ton ($9 per ton) than Route 1 ($10 per ton), so we will use Route 3 to its maximum capacity:\nx3 = 7 tons\n\nFinally, if there are still products left to transport, we will use Route 1:\nx1 = 5 tons\n\nHowever, this solution assumes that there are at least 20 tons of products to transport (8 tons on Route 2, 7 tons on Route 3, and 5 tons on Route 1). If there are fewer than 20 tons of products, we will need to adjust the amounts transported on each route accordingly, while still prioritizing the routes with lower transportation costs.\n\nIn summary, to minimize the total transportation cost, we should transport:\n- 8 tons on Route 2 (if available)\n- 7 tons on Route 3 (if available, after using Route 2)\n- The remaining tons on Route 1 (if needed, after using Routes 2 and 3)"
