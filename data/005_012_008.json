    "message_2": "To find the expected number of females in the sample, we can use the proportion of females in the population and multiply it by the sample size.\n\nProportion of females in the population = 40% = 0.4\nSample size = 500 individuals\n\nExpected number of females in the sample = (Proportion of females) × (Sample size) = 0.4 × 500 = 200 females."
