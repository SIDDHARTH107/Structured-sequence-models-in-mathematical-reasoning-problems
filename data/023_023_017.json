    "message_2": "To find the frequency spectrum of the given bitstream \"010101...\", we can model the signal as a square wave with a period of T = 2 units (since it takes 2 units for the pattern to repeat). The amplitude of the square wave is 1, as it oscillates between 0 and 1.\n\nUsing Fourier analysis, we can represent the square wave as a sum of sine and cosine functions. The Fourier series representation of a square wave with amplitude A and period T is given by:\n\nf(t) = (4A/π) * (sin(ωt) + (1/3)sin(3ωt) + (1/5)sin(5ωt) + ...)\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T is the angular frequency.\n\nIn our case, A = 1 and T = 2, so ω = 2π/2 = π. Therefore, the Fourier series representation of the given bitstream is:\n\nf(t) = (4/π) * (sin(πt) + (1/3)sin(3πt) + (1/5)sin(5πt) + ...)\n\nTo find the frequency spectrum up to the fifth harmonic, we only need to consider the first three terms of the series:\n\nf(t) = (4/π) * (sin(πt) + (1/3)sin(3πt) + (1/5)sin(5πt))\n\nNow, we can identify the frequencies and their corresponding amplitudes:\n\n1st harmonic: frequency = π rad/s, amplitude = 4/π\n3rd harmonic: frequency = 3π rad/s, amplitude = 4/(3π)\n5th harmonic: frequency = 5π rad/s, amplitude = 4/(5π)\n\nSo, the frequency spectrum of the given bitstream up to the fifth harmonic is:\n\n1st harmonic: (π, 4/π)\n3rd harmonic: (3π, 4/(3π))\n5th harmonic: (5π, 4/(5π))"
