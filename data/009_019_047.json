    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem for a student studying Stochastic differential equations for random processes:\n\nSuppose we have a stock price process defined by the stochastic differential equation: dS(t) = µS(t)dt + σS(t)dW(t), where µ = 0.05, σ = 0.2, S(0) = 100, and W(t) is a standard Brownian motion. What is the expected stock price after 2 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected stock price after 2 years, we can use the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The SDE given is a geometric Brownian motion, which has the following closed-form solution:\n\nS(t) = S(0) * exp((µ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))\n\nWe want to find the expected value of S(t) after 2 years, i.e., E[S(2)]. Since W(t) is a standard Brownian motion, its mean is 0 and its variance is t. Therefore, E[W(2)] = 0 and Var[W(2)] = 2.\n\nNow, we can find the expected value of S(2):\n\nE[S(2)] = E[S(0) * exp((µ - (σ^2)/2) * 2 + σ * W(2))]\n         = S(0) * E[exp((µ - (σ^2)/2) * 2 + σ * W(2))]\n\nSince S(0) is a constant, we can take it out of the expectation:\n\nE[S(2)] = 100 * E[exp((0.05 - (0.2^2)/2) * 2 + 0.2 * W(2))]\n\nNow, we can use the properties of the exponential function and the fact that E[W(2)] = 0:\n\nE[S(2)] = 100 * exp((0.05 - (0.2^2)/2) * 2) * E[exp(0.2 * W(2))]\n\nTo find E[exp(0.2 * W(2))], we can use the moment-generating function (MGF) of the normal distribution. The MGF of a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2 is given by:\n\nMGF(t) = exp(0 * t + (2 * t^2)/2) = exp(t^2)\n\nNow, we can find E[exp(0.2 * W(2))] by plugging in t = 0.2 into the MGF:\n\nE[exp(0.2 * W(2))] = exp((0.2)^2) = exp(0.04)\n\nFinally, we can plug this back into our expression for E[S(2)]:\n\nE[S(2)] = 100 * exp((0.05 - (0.2^2)/2) * 2) * exp(0.04)\n         ≈ 100 * exp(0.06) * exp(0.04)\n         ≈ 100 * exp(0.1)\n         ≈ 100 * 1.10517\n         ≈ 110.517\n\nSo, the expected stock price after 2 years is approximately $110.52."
