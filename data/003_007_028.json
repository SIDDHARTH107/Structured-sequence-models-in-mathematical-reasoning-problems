    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides with length 5 and 7, and an angle of 60 degrees between them. What is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = 7, and C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 25 + 49 - 70 * (1/2)\nc² = 74 - 35\nc² = 39\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\n\nc = √39 ≈ 6.24\n\nSo, the length of the third side is approximately 6.24 units."
