    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a highly complex and chaotic system, which means that it is very sensitive to initial conditions and does not have a simple closed-form solution for the maximum angle of the first pendulum. However, we can provide a rough estimate based on the conservation of energy.\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system is conserved since there is no friction or air resistance. Initially, all the energy is potential energy, and at the maximum angle, all the energy will be potential energy again. The potential energy of the first pendulum can be calculated as:\n\nPE_initial = m * g * h_initial\n\nwhere m is the mass of the bob (0.1 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and h_initial is the initial height of the first bob above its lowest point. Since the initial angle is 30 degrees, we can calculate h_initial as:\n\nh_initial = L * (1 - cos(30°))\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (1 m). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nh_initial ≈ 1 * (1 - cos(30°)) ≈ 0.134 m\n\nPE_initial ≈ 0.1 * 9.81 * 0.134 ≈ 0.131 J\n\nNow, at the maximum angle, the potential energy will be the same:\n\nPE_max = m * g * h_max\n\nWe can solve for h_max:\n\nh_max = PE_max / (m * g) ≈ 0.131 / (0.1 * 9.81) ≈ 0.134 m\n\nNow, we can find the maximum angle using the height:\n\ncos(theta_max) = 1 - h_max / L\n\ntheta_max = arccos(1 - 0.134) ≈ 49.5°\n\nThis is a rough estimate of the maximum angle made by the first pendulum of the double pendulum system, given the initial conditions. Keep in mind that the actual behavior of the double pendulum can be quite chaotic and may not follow this estimate precisely."
