    "message_1": "Suppose we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n```\n2x + y = 7.2\n3x - 2y = 5.3\nx + 4y = 10.1\n```\n\nHowever, the data is noisy and each coefficient and constant is rounded to the nearest tenth. Find the solution to this system of linear equations with noisy data.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with noisy data, we can use the given equations as they are and find the solution. We can use the method of substitution or elimination to solve the system. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the first two equations:\n\n1) Multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n```\n4x + 2y = 14.4\n```\n\n2) Add the modified first equation to the second equation:\n```\n(4x + 2y) + (3x - 2y) = 14.4 + 5.3\n7x = 19.7\n```\n\n3) Solve for x:\n```\nx = 19.7 / 7\nx ≈ 2.814\n```\n\nNow, let's substitute the value of x into the third equation to find y:\n\n```\n2.814 + 4y = 10.1\n```\n\n4) Solve for y:\n```\n4y = 10.1 - 2.814\n4y ≈ 7.286\ny ≈ 1.822\n```\n\nSo, the solution to this system of linear equations with noisy data is approximately x ≈ 2.814 and y ≈ 1.822."
