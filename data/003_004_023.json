    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 for x between 0 and 360 degrees, follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(x) by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation and then dividing by 2:\n2sin(x) = -1\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\n2. Find the inverse sine (arcsin) of -1/2:\nx = arcsin(-1/2)\n\n3. Determine the angles in the specified range (0 to 360 degrees) that have a sine of -1/2:\nx = 210 degrees and x = 330 degrees\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x = 210 degrees and x = 330 degrees."
