    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Maximum Independent Set (MIS). An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices are adjacent. The maximum independent set is the largest possible independent set in the graph.\n\nThe given graph can be represented as follows:\n\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5\n      |   |\n      6   7\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of vertices that can be selected such that no two selected vertices share an edge.\n\nOne possible maximum independent set is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}. In this set, no two vertices share an edge. There are 5 vertices in this set, which is the maximum number of vertices that can be selected without sharing an edge.\n\nSo, the maximum number of vertices that can be selected such that no two selected vertices share an edge is 5."
