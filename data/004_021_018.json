    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x), we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x).\n\nGiven f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x - 3, let's find f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x - 3)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x), by finding the derivative of f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 12x + 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 12x + 10."
