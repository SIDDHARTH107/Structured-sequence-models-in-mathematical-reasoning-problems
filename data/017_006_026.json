    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G, which is a subgroup of order p^n, where p^n is the highest power of p dividing the order of G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, divides the order of G, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let's apply these theorems to the group G of order 77.\n\nSince 77 = 7^1 * 11^1, we have two prime divisors, 7 and 11. By the first Sylow theorem, there exist Sylow 7-subgroups and Sylow 11-subgroups in G.\n\nLet n_7 and n_11 denote the number of Sylow 7-subgroups and Sylow 11-subgroups, respectively. By the third Sylow theorem, we have:\n\nn_7 | 11 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\nn_11 | 7 and n_11 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nThe only possibilities for n_7 are 1 and 11, and the only possibility for n_11 is 1. If n_7 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, say P_7, and similarly, if n_11 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 11-subgroup, say P_11.\n\nSince P_7 and P_11 are unique, they are normal in G (as any conjugate of a Sylow p-subgroup is also a Sylow p-subgroup, and uniqueness implies that any conjugate must be the subgroup itself). Now, we have two normal subgroups P_7 and P_11 in G with orders 7 and 11, respectively.\n\nNotice that the orders of P_7 and P_11 are coprime (gcd(7, 11) = 1). By the second isomorphism theorem, we have:\n\nG / (P_7 ∩ P_11) ≅ P_7 * P_11\n\nSince the orders of P_7 and P_11 are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_7 ∩ P_11 = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Thus, we have:\n\nG ≅ P_7 * P_11\n\nNow, P_7 and P_11 are cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, respectively, as they are Sylow p-subgroups of prime order. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11.\n\nIn the case where n_7 = 11, we cannot guarantee that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11. However, if G has an element of order 77 (which is the least common multiple of 7 and 11), then G is cyclic. To see this, let x be an element of order 77 in G. Then, the cyclic group generated by x, ⟨x⟩, has order 77, and since G has order 77, we have G = ⟨x⟩.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11."
