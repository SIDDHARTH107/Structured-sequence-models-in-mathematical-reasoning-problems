    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 out of 50 people will be affected by the disease, we can first find the probability that none or only one person is affected, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's denote the probability of being affected by the disease as p = 0.05 and the probability of not being affected as q = 1 - p = 0.95.\n\n1. Probability of none being affected (all 50 not affected): \nP(0) = (0.95)^50\n\n2. Probability of only one person being affected (49 not affected, 1 affected):\nP(1) = C(50,1) * (0.95)^49 * (0.05)^1\nwhere C(50,1) is the number of combinations of choosing 1 person out of 50, which is 50.\n\nNow, we find the probability of either none or only one person being affected:\nP(0 or 1) = P(0) + P(1)\n\nFinally, we find the probability of at least 2 people being affected:\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0 or 1)\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(0) = (0.95)^50 ≈ 0.1296\nP(1) = 50 * (0.95)^49 * (0.05)^1 ≈ 0.3434\nP(0 or 1) = 0.1296 + 0.3434 = 0.4730\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - 0.4730 = 0.5270\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 out of 50 people from the specific demographic group will be affected by the disease is approximately 52.70%."
