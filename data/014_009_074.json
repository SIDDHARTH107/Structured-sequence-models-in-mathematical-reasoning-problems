    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext for the given plaintext and secret key using a Feistel cipher, we would need to know the specific round function (F-function) used in the cipher. The Feistel cipher is a general structure for symmetric key block ciphers, and the specific round function can vary depending on the implementation.\n\nHowever, I can provide a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext into two equal halves, L0 and R0.\n2. For each round i (from 1 to 16), perform the following steps:\n   a. Compute the round key Ki using the secret key and a key schedule algorithm.\n   b. Compute the output of the round function F(Ri-1, Ki).\n   c. Calculate Li = Ri-1 XOR F(Ri-1, Ki).\n   d. Calculate Ri = Li-1.\n3. After the 16th round, concatenate the final L16 and R16 to form the ciphertext.\n\nWithout knowing the specific round function and key schedule algorithm, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext. If you provide more information about the Feistel cipher implementation, I would be happy to help you further."
