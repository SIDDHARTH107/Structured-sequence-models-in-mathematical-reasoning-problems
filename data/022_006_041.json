    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of the complex function f(z) = z^3 - 3iz^2 in the region |z| ≤ 1, we can use the polar form of complex numbers and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nLet z = re^(iθ), where r is the modulus of z and θ is the argument of z. Then, |z| = r and z^2 = r^2e^(2iθ). Now, we can rewrite the function f(z) in terms of r and θ:\n\nf(z) = (re^(iθ))^3 - 3i(re^(iθ))^2\n     = r^3e^(3iθ) - 3ir^2e^(2iθ)\n\nNow, let's find the modulus of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |r^3e^(3iθ) - 3ir^2e^(2iθ)|\n       = |r^2(r - 3i)e^(2iθ)|\n\nSince |r - 3i| ≥ |3 - r| (by the triangle inequality), we have:\n\n|f(z)| ≥ |r^2(3 - r)e^(2iθ)|\n\nNow, we want to find the minimum and maximum values of |f(z)| in the region |z| ≤ 1, which means r ≤ 1. \n\nFor the minimum value, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n\n|r^2(3 - r)| ≤ √((r^4 + (3 - r)^4)/2)\n\nSince r ≤ 1, the minimum value of |f(z)| occurs when r = 1:\n\n|f_min(z)| = |(1 - 3i)e^(2iθ)|\n            = √((1^4 + (3 - 1)^4)/2)\n            = √(1 + 16)/2\n            = √17/2\n\nFor the maximum value, we can use the fact that |r^2(3 - r)| ≤ 3r^2:\n\n|f_max(z)| = |3r^2e^(2iθ)|\n\nSince r ≤ 1, the maximum value of |f(z)| occurs when r = 1:\n\n|f_max(z)| = |3e^(2iθ)|\n            = 3\n\nSo, the minimum and maximum values of |f(z)| in the region |z| ≤ 1 are √17/2 and 3, respectively."
