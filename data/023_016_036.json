    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |x| for -π ≤ x ≤ π, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function (f(-x) = f(x)), all the b_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the a_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of a function f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = (a_0 / 2) + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nFor an even function, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = (a_0 / 2) + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients a_0 and a_n:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x)] dx from -π to π\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nFor f(x) = |x|, we have:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[|x|] dx from -π to π\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[|x| * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nNow, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * [∫[-x] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x] dx from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1 / π) * [(x^2 / 2) from -π to 0 + (x^2 / 2) from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1 / π) * [π^2 / 2]\na_0 = π / 2\n\nNow, let's compute a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [∫[-x * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx from 0 to π]\n\nTo compute the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (1 / n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx = (x * (1 / n) * sin(n * x)) - ∫[(1 / n) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nNow, integrate (1 / n) * sin(n * x) dx:\n\n∫[(1 / n) * sin(n * x) dx] = (-1 / n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx = (x * (1 / n) * sin(n * x)) - (-1 / n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nNow, we can compute a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [(x * (1 / n) * sin(n * x) + (1 / n^2) * cos(n * x)) from -π to 0 + (x * (1 / n) * sin(n * x) - (1 / n^2) * cos(n * x)) from 0 to π]\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [(1 / n^2) * (cos(n * π) - 1) - (1 / n^2) * (1 - cos(n * π))]\na_n = (1 / π) * (2 / n^2) * (1 - cos(n * π))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = |x|:\n\nf(x) = (π / 2) + Σ [(2 / (n^2 * π)) * (1 - cos(n * π)) * cos(n * x)] for n = 1 to infinity"
