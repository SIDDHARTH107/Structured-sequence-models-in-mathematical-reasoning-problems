    "message_2": "To find the size of the minimum vertex cover of the graph G, we can use the fact that the size of a minimum vertex cover is at least the size of a maximum matching. In other words, the minimum vertex cover is the smallest set of vertices that can cover all the edges in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's consider the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with 7 vertices. This would be a complete graph, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the number of edges would be:\n\nE = (7 * 6) / 2 = 21\n\nHowever, our graph G has only 9 edges, which means it is not a complete graph. To find the size of the minimum vertex cover, we can use the following inequality:\n\nsize of minimum vertex cover â‰¥ (size of maximum matching)\n\nA matching is a set of edges in which no two edges share a common vertex. In a graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges, the maximum matching can have at most 3 edges (since each edge in the matching covers 2 vertices, and there are 7 vertices in total).\n\nTherefore, the size of the minimum vertex cover is at least 3. However, we need to check if this is achievable. We can construct a graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges that has a vertex cover of size 3:\n\n1. Create a star graph with a central vertex connected to 3 other vertices (4 vertices and 3 edges so far).\n2. Add another star graph with a central vertex connected to the remaining 3 vertices (7 vertices and 6 edges so far).\n3. Add 3 edges between the outer vertices of the two star graphs (7 vertices and 9 edges in total).\n\nIn this graph, the central vertices of the two star graphs and one of the outer vertices form a vertex cover of size 3. Since this graph has 7 vertices and 9 edges, the size of the minimum vertex cover of graph G is 3."
