    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 4 cm. Calculate its surface area (including the base) in cm², rounded to the nearest hundredth?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a cone, we need to find the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle, so we can use the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr², where r is the radius.\n\nA_base = π(4 cm)² = 16π cm²\n\nTo find the lateral surface area, we first need to find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this: l² = r² + h², where r is the radius, h is the height, and l is the slant height.\n\nl² = (4 cm)² + (8 cm)² = 16 cm² + 64 cm² = 80 cm²\nl = √80 cm ≈ 8.94 cm\n\nNow we can use the formula for the lateral surface area of a cone: A_lateral = πrl, where r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nA_lateral = π(4 cm)(8.94 cm) ≈ 113.04 cm²\n\nFinally, we add the base area and the lateral surface area together to find the total surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral ≈ 16π cm² + 113.04 cm² ≈ 50.27 cm² + 113.04 cm² ≈ 163.31 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 163.31 cm², rounded to the nearest hundredth."
