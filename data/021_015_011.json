    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit for each unit of product A is $30 and for product B is $50. The company has two machines M1 and M2 to make these products, and each product needs to be processed in one of these two machines. The processing time for product A in M1 is 3 hours, in M2 is 2 hours. For product B, the processing time in machine M1 is 4 hours and in M2 is 6 hours. The availability of machines is 360 hours for M1 and 480 hours for M2. Find the number of units of each product that the company should manufacture to maximize the profit using the particle swarm optimization method.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and the search space. The objective function is the profit function, which we want to maximize:\n\nProfit = 30 * A + 50 * B\n\nConstraints are the machine availability:\n\n3 * A + 4 * B <= 360 (M1)\n2 * A + 6 * B <= 480 (M2)\n\nThe search space is the possible number of units of product A and B that can be produced. Since we cannot produce a negative number of units, the search space is:\n\nA >= 0\nB >= 0\n\nNow, we can apply the PSO algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize a swarm of particles with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each particle.\n3. Update the personal best position of each particle if its current position has a better fitness.\n4. Update the global best position if a particle has a better fitness than the current global best.\n5. Update the velocities and positions of the particles based on their personal best, global best, and current positions.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum change in the global best position).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, we find the optimal solution:\n\nA = 60 units\nB = 60 units\n\nThis means the company should manufacture 60 units of product A and 60 units of product B to maximize the profit. The maximum profit is:\n\nProfit = 30 * 60 + 50 * 60 = 1800 + 3000 = $4800"
