If Player 1 keeps x dollars, how much money will Player 2 receive if:\n\na) x = 8\nb) x = 2\nc) x = 5\n\nShow your work and explain your reasoning.",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the total amount of money given to both players is 10 dollars. If Player 1 keeps x dollars, then Player 2 will receive the remaining amount, which can be calculated as:\n\nAmount for Player 2 = Total amount - Amount for Player 1\nAmount for Player 2 = 10 - x\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount Player 2 will receive for each given value of x:\n\na) x = 8\nAmount for Player 2 = 10 - 8 = 2 dollars\nIn this case, Player 1 keeps 8 dollars and gives 2 dollars to Player 2.\n\nb) x = 2\nAmount for Player 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 dollars\nIn this case, Player 1 keeps 2 dollars and gives 8 dollars to Player 2.\n\nc) x = 5\nAmount for Player 2 = 10 - 5 = 5 dollars\nIn this case, Player 1 keeps 5 dollars and gives 5 dollars to Player 2.\n\nSo, the amounts Player 2 will receive for each case are:\na) 2 dollars\nb) 8 dollars\nc) 5 dollars"
