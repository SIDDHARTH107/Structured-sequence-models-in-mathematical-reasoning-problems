    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar or non-planar, we can use Kuratowski's theorem or Euler's formula. In this case, we will use Euler's formula, which states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given a graph with six vertices (V = 6) and six edges (E = 6). We need to find the number of faces (F) to check if the graph is planar.\n\nLet's rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nF = 2 - 6 + 6\nF = 2\n\nSince F is a non-negative integer, the graph is planar."
