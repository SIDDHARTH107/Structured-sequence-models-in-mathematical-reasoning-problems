    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x + 6 on the interval [0, 4], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function. \n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 4\n\nNow, let's set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 10x + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -10, and c = 4:\n\nx = (10 ± √((-10)^2 - 4(3)(4))) / (2(3))\nx = (10 ± √(100 - 48)) / 6\nx = (10 ± √52) / 6\n\nSo, we have two critical points: x = (10 + √52) / 6 and x = (10 - √52) / 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 5(0)^2 + 4(0) + 6 = 6\nf(4) = 4^3 - 5(4)^2 + 4(4) + 6 = 64 - 80 + 16 + 6 = 6\n\nf((10 + √52) / 6) ≈ -1.287\nf((10 - √52) / 6) ≈ 10.287\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we can see that the maximum value is 10.287 at x ≈ (10 - √52) / 6, and the minimum value is -1.287 at x ≈ (10 + √52) / 6."
