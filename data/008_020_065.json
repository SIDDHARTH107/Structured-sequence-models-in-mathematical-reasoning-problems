    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we will first eliminate one variable from two of the equations, and then eliminate the same variable from the other two equations. This will give us two new equations with two variables. We will then eliminate one of the remaining variables from these two new equations to find the value of the other variable. Finally, we will substitute the found values back into the original equations to find the values of the other two variables.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate z from equations 1 and 2, and from equations 1 and 3.\n\nTo do this, we will multiply equation 1 by -2 and add it to equation 2, and multiply equation 1 by -2 and add it to equation 3.\n\nEquation 1 * -2:\n-2x - 4y - 2z = -10\n\nAdd this to equation 2:\n(3x + 4y + 2z) + (-2x - 4y - 2z) = 11 + (-10)\nx = 1\n\nEquation 1 * -2:\n-2x - 4y - 2z = -10\n\nAdd this to equation 3:\n(2x + 3y + 2z) + (-2x - 4y - 2z) = 8 + (-10)\n-y = -2\n\nNow we have:\nx = 1\n-y = -2\n\nStep 2: Solve for y.\n-y = -2\ny = 2\n\nStep 3: Substitute the found values of x and y back into any of the original equations to find the value of z. We will use equation 1.\n\nx + 2y + z = 5\n1 + 2(2) + z = 5\n1 + 4 + z = 5\nz = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 0."
