    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 24x^2 + 10x - 8, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then the second derivative, f''(x).\n\n1. Find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 16x^3 + 24x^2 + 10x - 8)\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 48x^2 + 48x + 10\n\n2. Find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 48x^2 + 48x + 10)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 96x + 48\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 96(2) + 48\nf''(2) = 36(4) - 192 + 48\nf''(2) = 144 - 192 + 48\nf''(2) = 0\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 24x^2 + 10x - 8 at x = 2 is 0."
