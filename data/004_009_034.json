    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x)(2x - 1) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together: u(x) = x^2 + 3x and v(x) = 2x - 1.\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of each function with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(u)/dx = d(x^2 + 3x)/dx = 2x + 3\nv'(x) = d(v)/dx = d(2x - 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (2x + 3)(2x - 1) + (x^2 + 3x)(2)\n\nNow, we expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (4x^2 - 2x + 6x - 3) + (2x^2 + 6x)\nf'(x) = 4x^2 + 4x - 3 + 2x^2 + 6x\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x - 3\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x)(2x - 1) is f'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x - 3."
