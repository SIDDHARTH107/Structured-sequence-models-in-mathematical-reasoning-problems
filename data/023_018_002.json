    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we need to replace the Laplace transform variable 's' with the imaginary unit times the angular frequency 'jω' (where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency). The frequency response is given by:\n\nH(jω) = G(jω)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nH(jω) = (2(jω)^2 + 3(jω) + 1)/((jω)^3 + 4(jω)^2 + 3(jω))\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\nH(jω) = (2(-ω^2) + 3jω + 1)/(j^3ω^3 + 4(-ω^2) + 3jω)\n\nH(jω) = (-2ω^2 + 3jω + 1)/(-jω^3 + 4ω^2 + 3jω)\n\nNow, we have the frequency response of the system in terms of the angular frequency ω. The magnitude and phase response can be found by calculating the magnitude and phase of the complex function H(jω)."
