    "message_2": "Let the length of the shorter leg be x cm, then the length of the longer leg is (x + 8) cm. According to the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nx^2 + (x + 8)^2 = 20^2\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n\nx^2 + (x^2 + 16x + 64) = 400\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x^2 + 16x + 64 = 400\n\nSubtract 400 from both sides:\n\n2x^2 + 16x - 336 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 2 to simplify:\n\nx^2 + 8x - 168 = 0\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 12)(x + 14) = 0\n\nThe possible values for x are 12 and -14. Since the length cannot be negative, x = 12 cm. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is 12 cm, and the length of the longer leg is (12 + 8) = 20 cm.\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = shorter leg + longer leg + hypotenuse\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 20 cm + 20 cm = 52 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 52 cm."
