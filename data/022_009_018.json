    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we will use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. \n\nLet's consider the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(-1)^{n+1} z^{2(n+1)}}{(2(n+1)+1)!}}{\\frac{(-1)^n z^{2n}}{(2n+1)!}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(-1)^{n+1} z^{2n+2}(2n+1)!}{(-1)^n z^{2n}(2n+3)!}\\right|$$\n\nCancel out the terms:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{z^2}{(2n+2)(2n+3)}\\right|$$\n\nNow, we want this limit to be less than 1 for the series to converge:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{z^2}{(2n+2)(2n+3)}\\right| < 1$$\n\nSince the limit does not depend on n, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n$$|z^2| < (2n+2)(2n+3)$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the right side of the inequality will also approach infinity. Therefore, the series converges for all z. This means that the radius of convergence is infinite.\n\nThe interval of convergence is the set of all z values for which the series converges. Since the radius of convergence is infinite, the interval of convergence is:\n\n$$(-\\infty, \\infty)$$"
