    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the control system at t=0, we need to evaluate the transfer function G(s) at s = jω, where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1). The frequency response is given by:\n\n$$ G(j\\omega) = \\frac{20}{(j\\omega)^2 + 6(j\\omega) + 25} $$\n\nNow, let's substitute (jω)^2 and simplify the expression:\n\n$$ (j\\omega)^2 = j^2 \\omega^2 = -1 \\cdot \\omega^2 = -\\omega^2 $$\n\nSo, the transfer function becomes:\n\n$$ G(j\\omega) = \\frac{20}{-\\omega^2 + 6(j\\omega) + 25} $$\n\nNow, let's find the frequency response at t=0. At t=0, the angular frequency ω is 0. So, we have:\n\n$$ G(j\\cdot 0) = \\frac{20}{-0^2 + 6(j\\cdot 0) + 25} $$\n\n$$ G(j\\cdot 0) = \\frac{20}{25} $$\n\n$$ G(j\\cdot 0) = \\frac{4}{5} $$\n\nThus, the frequency response of the control system at t=0 is $\\frac{4}{5}$."
