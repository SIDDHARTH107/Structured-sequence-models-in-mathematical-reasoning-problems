    "message_1": "Suppose we have the system of equations: \n\n2x + 3y = 5 \n\n4x + 6y = 10 \n\nWhat can we conclude about the system of equations? Is there a solution? If so, what is it?",
    "message_2": "We can conclude that the system of equations is dependent, meaning the two equations represent the same line. To see this, notice that the second equation can be obtained by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n\n(2x + 3y = 5) * 2 â‡’ 4x + 6y = 10\n\nSince the two equations represent the same line, there are infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. For example, solving the first equation for y:\n\n3y = 5 - 2x\ny = (5 - 2x)/3\n\nSo, the general solution is given by (x, (5 - 2x)/3) for any value of x."
