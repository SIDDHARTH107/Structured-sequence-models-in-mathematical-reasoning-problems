    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the car at t = 5 seconds, we need to find the first and second derivatives of the position function s(t) with respect to time t.\n\nThe position function is given by s(t) = 3t^2 - 2t + 1.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative of s(t) with respect to t, which represents the velocity function v(t):\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(3t^2 - 2t + 1)/dt = 6t - 2.\n\nNext, we find the second derivative of s(t) with respect to t, which represents the acceleration function a(t):\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t - 2)/dt = 6.\n\nNow, we can find the velocity and acceleration of the car at t = 5 seconds by plugging t = 5 into the velocity and acceleration functions:\n\nVelocity at t = 5 seconds: v(5) = 6(5) - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28 m/s.\nAcceleration at t = 5 seconds: a(5) = 6 m/s^2 (since the acceleration function is a constant).\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at t = 5 seconds is 28 m/s, and the acceleration is 6 m/s^2."
