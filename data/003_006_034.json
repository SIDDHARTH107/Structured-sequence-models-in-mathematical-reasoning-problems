    "message_2": "To find the length of sides a and c using the Law of Sines, we first need to find the measure of angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can calculate angle C as follows:\n\nAngle C = 180 - (Angle A + Angle B)\nAngle C = 180 - (60 + 70)\nAngle C = 180 - 130\nAngle C = 50 degrees\n\nNow that we have all the angles, we can use the Law of Sines to find the lengths of sides a and c. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant for all three sides of a triangle. In other words:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe are given side b = 10 cm and its opposite angle B = 70 degrees. We can now use this information to find sides a and c:\n\na / sin(60) = 10 / sin(70)\na = (10 * sin(60)) / sin(70)\n\nc / sin(50) = 10 / sin(70)\nc = (10 * sin(50)) / sin(70)\n\nNow, we can calculate the lengths of sides a and c:\n\na = (10 * sin(60)) / sin(70) ≈ 9.54 cm\nc = (10 * sin(50)) / sin(70) ≈ 8.66 cm\n\nSo, the lengths of sides a and c are approximately 9.54 cm and 8.66 cm, respectively."
