The first person to choose three numbers that add up to a multiple of three wins the game. If Alice goes first, how many possible ways are there for her to win the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's first list all the possible combinations of three numbers that add up to a multiple of three:\n\n(1,2,9), (1,3,6), (1,4,8), (1,5,7), (2,3,7), (2,4,6), (2,5,8), (3,4,5), (3,6,9), (4,5,9), (4,7,8), (5,6,7)\n\nThere are 12 possible combinations.\n\nNow, let's consider the ways Alice can win:\n\n1. Alice wins in her second turn (after choosing two numbers). This means Bob must have chosen a number that completes a winning combination for Alice. However, this is not possible, as Alice will always have only one number after her first turn, and at least two numbers are needed to form a winning combination.\n\n2. Alice wins in her third turn (after choosing three numbers). In this case, we need to make sure that Bob's choices do not complete a winning combination for him.\n\nLet's analyze each winning combination for Alice:\n\na. (1,2,9): Bob can choose either 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. If he chooses 3, 6, or 7, he will win on his second turn (3+6, 3+7, 6+7). So, Bob must choose either 4, 5, or 8. There are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nb. (1,3,6): Similar to the previous case, Bob can choose either 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9. If he chooses 2, 7, or 9, he will win on his second turn (2+7, 2+9, 7+9). So, Bob must choose either 4, 5, or 8. There are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nc. (1,4,8): Bob can choose either 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, or 9. If he chooses 2, 5, or 9, he will win on his second turn (2+5, 2+9, 5+9). So, Bob must choose either 3, 6, or 7. There are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nd. (1,5,7): Bob can choose either 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 9. If he chooses 3, 6, or 9, he will win on his second turn (3+6, 3+9, 6+9). So, Bob must choose either 2, 4, or 8. There are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\ne. (2,3,7): Bob can choose either 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 9. If he chooses 1, 4, or 6, he will win on his second turn (1+4, 1+6, 4+6). So, Bob must choose either 5, 8, or 9. There are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nf. (2,4,6): Similar to case b, there are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\ng. (2,5,8): Similar to case c, there are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nh. (3,4,5): Bob can choose either 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, or 9. If he chooses 1, 2, or 7, he will win on his second turn (1+2, 1+7, 2+7). So, Bob must choose either 6, 8, or 9. There are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\ni. (3,6,9): Similar to case a, there are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nj. (4,5,9): Similar to case a, there are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nk. (4,7,8): Similar to case a, there are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nl. (5,6,7): Similar to case a, there are 3 ways for Alice to win in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 3 * 12 = 36 ways for Alice to win the game."
