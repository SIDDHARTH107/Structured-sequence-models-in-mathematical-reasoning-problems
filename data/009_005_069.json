    "message_2": "a) The total impedance of the circuit:\n\nThe total impedance (Z) of a series RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, XL is the inductive reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC).\n\nXL = 2 * π * f * L\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, L is the inductance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven values: R = 10 Ω, L = 100 mH = 0.1 H, C = 10 μF = 10 * 10^(-6) F, and f = 100 Hz.\n\nNow, let's calculate XL and XC:\n\nXL = 2 * π * 100 * 0.1 = 20π Ω ≈ 62.83 Ω\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * 100 * 10 * 10^(-6)) = 1 / (0.02π) Ω ≈ 15.92 Ω\n\nNow we can find the total impedance Z:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2) = √(10^2 + (62.83 - 15.92)^2) ≈ √(10^2 + 46.91^2) ≈ 48.07 Ω\n\na) The total impedance of the circuit is approximately 48.07 Ω.\n\nb) The phase angle between the voltage source and the current:\n\nThe phase angle (θ) is given by the formula:\n\nθ = arctan((XL - XC) / R)\n\nθ = arctan((62.83 - 15.92) / 10) ≈ arctan(4.691) ≈ 78.04°\n\nb) The phase angle between the voltage source and the current is approximately 78.04°.\n\nc) The current flowing through the circuit:\n\nThe current (I) can be calculated using Ohm's law:\n\nI = V / Z\n\nwhere V is the peak voltage.\n\nGiven value: V = 20 V.\n\nI = 20 / 48.07 ≈ 0.416 A\n\nc) The current flowing through the circuit is approximately 0.416 A."
