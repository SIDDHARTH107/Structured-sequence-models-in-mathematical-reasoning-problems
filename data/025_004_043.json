    "message_2": "In the complex projective plane, a rational curve of degree 5 (also known as a quintic curve) has infinitely many points. This is because a rational curve can be parameterized by rational functions, and in the complex projective plane, there are infinitely many complex numbers that can be used as parameters for these functions. As a result, the curve will have infinitely many points."
