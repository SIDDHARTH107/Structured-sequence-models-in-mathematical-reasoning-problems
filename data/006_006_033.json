    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a basketball player making at least 70% of their free throw attempts, we first need to determine their current success rate. In this case, the player has made 21 out of 30 attempts, which gives them a success rate of 21/30 = 0.7 or 70%.\n\nNow, we need to determine the probability of the player maintaining or improving this success rate in future attempts. However, this is not possible without additional information about the player's overall free throw shooting ability, such as their historical success rate or the success rate of similar players.\n\nIn summary, we cannot determine the probability of the player making at least 70% of their free throw attempts in the future based solely on their current success rate of 21 out of 30 attempts."
