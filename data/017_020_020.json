    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given group G. We know that the order of G is 40, and we have elements of order 5, 2, 2, and 2. Since there is an element of order 5, G cannot be a dihedral group D20 (as all elements in D20 have order 1, 2, or 4).\n\nNow, let's consider the cyclic group C40. In a cyclic group, there is a single generator element, say g, such that every other element in the group can be expressed as a power of g. However, in G, we have elements of order 2 and 5, which cannot be expressed as powers of a single generator element. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to C40.\n\nNext, let's analyze the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. These groups can be represented as semi-direct products of cyclic groups. In particular, we can represent G as a semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 (generated by a) and a cyclic group of order 8 (generated by b, c, and d). \n\nThe structure of G can be described as follows:\n\n1. The cyclic subgroup generated by a has order 5: {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4}.\n2. The cyclic subgroup generated by b, c, and d has order 8: {e, b, c, d, bc, bd, cd, bcd}.\n3. The product of elements from the two subgroups results in the remaining elements of G.\n\nSince G can be represented as a semi-direct product of cyclic groups, it must be isomorphic to one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. To determine which one, we can look at the relations between the generators a, b, c, and d.\n\nIn G, we have the following relations:\n\n1. a^5 = e\n2. b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = e\n3. bcd = e (since bcd is the only element of order 2 in the subgroup generated by b, c, and d that is not included in the list)\n\nNow, let's compare these relations to the eight non-abelian groups of order 40:\n\n1. C5 ⋊ C8: This group has a similar structure to G, but it has a single element of order 2 in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G.\n2. C5 ⋊ Q8: This group has a quaternion structure in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G.\n3. C5 ⋊ D4: This group has a dihedral structure in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G.\n4. C5 ⋊ (C2 × C4): This group has a similar structure to G, but it has two elements of order 4 in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G.\n5. C5 ⋊ (C2 × Q4): This group has a quaternion structure in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G.\n6. C5 ⋊ (C2 × D2): This group has a dihedral structure in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G.\n7. C5 ⋊ (C2 × C2 × C2): This group has the same structure as G, with three elements of order 2 in the second cyclic subgroup and the relation bcd = e.\n8. C5 ⋊ (C2 × C2 × C2)': This group has a similar structure to G, but it does not have the relation bcd = e.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the group G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group C5 ⋊ (C2 × C2 × C2), which is the 7th group in the list of non-abelian groups of order 40."
