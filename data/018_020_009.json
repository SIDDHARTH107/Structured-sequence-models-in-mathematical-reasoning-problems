    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted by A ∆ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nA ∩ B = {4, 5}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and the set {3, 4, 6}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ {3, 4, 6} = ({1, 2, 3, 6, 7} ∪ {3, 4, 6}) - ({1, 2, 3, 6, 7} ∩ {3, 4, 6})\n\n{1, 2, 3, 6, 7} ∪ {3, 4, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}\n{1, 2, 3, 6, 7} ∩ {3, 4, 6} = {3, 6}\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ {3, 4, 6} = {1, 2, 4, 7}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over union.\n\nLet C = {3, 4, 6}.
