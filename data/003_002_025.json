    "message_2": "The value of sin(60°) and cos(45°) can be found using the unit circle or by remembering the special triangles.\n\nFor sin(60°):\nConsider an equilateral triangle with side length 2. If we cut it in half, we get a 30-60-90 right triangle with hypotenuse 2, the side opposite the 60° angle being √3, and the side adjacent to the 60° angle being 1. Therefore, sin(60°) is the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse:\n\nsin(60°) = (√3) / 2\n\nFor cos(45°):\nConsider an isosceles right triangle with legs of length 1. The angle between the legs is 45°. The hypotenuse, by the Pythagorean theorem, is √2. Therefore, cos(45°) is the ratio of the side adjacent to the angle to the hypotenuse:\n\ncos(45°) = 1 / √2 = √2 / 2 (by rationalizing the denominator)\n\nSo, sin(60°) = (√3) / 2 and cos(45°) = √2 / 2."
