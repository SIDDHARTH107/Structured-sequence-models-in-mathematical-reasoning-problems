    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has the order equal to the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, we have two prime numbers, so there are two possibilities for the structure of a group of order 35:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 35: Z_35\n2. A direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7: Z_5 × Z_7\n\nTo prove that any group of order 35 is isomorphic to either Z_35 or Z_5 × Z_7, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35. By Sylow's First Theorem, G has a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nBy Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they are both normal in G (by Sylow's Second Theorem). Let P = <a> and Q = <b>, where a has order 5 and b has order 7.\n\nNow, consider the element ab in G. Since P and Q are normal in G, we have:\n\n(ab)^5 = a^5b^5 = e (since a^5 = e and b^5 is in Q, which is normal)\n(ab)^7 = a^7b^7 = e (since a^7 is in P, which is normal, and b^7 = e)\n\nThus, the orders of ab divide both 5 and 7, which are prime numbers. Therefore, the order of ab is either 1, 5, or 7. If the order of ab is 1, then ab = e, which implies a = b^(-1), and G is cyclic (since a and b generate G). If the order of ab is 5 or 7, then G is generated by a, b, and ab, and G is isomorphic to the direct product Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 35 is either isomorphic to a cyclic group Z_35 or a direct product of two cyclic groups Z_5 × Z_7."
