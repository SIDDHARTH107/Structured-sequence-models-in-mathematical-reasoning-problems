    "message_2": "To prove that an arbitrary group of order 40 is isomorphic to either C40, D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 40. Since 40 = 2^3 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 8 and a Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5.\n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroup Q. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 8 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 can be either 1 or 8. If n_5 = 1, then Q is a normal subgroup of G. If n_5 = 8, then the action of G on the set of its Sylow 5-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to S_8. Since the order of G is 40, the image of this homomorphism has order dividing 40. However, the only non-trivial normal subgroup of S_8 with order dividing 40 is A_5, which has order 60. This is a contradiction, so n_5 must be 1, and Q is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroup P. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 5. If n_2 = 1, then P is a normal subgroup of G. If n_2 = 5, then the action of G on the set of its Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to S_5. Since the order of G is 40, the image of this homomorphism has order dividing 40. However, the only non-trivial normal subgroup of S_5 with order dividing 40 is A_5, which has order 60. This is a contradiction, so n_2 must be 1, and P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSince both P and Q are normal subgroups of G, their intersection P ∩ Q is also a normal subgroup of G. However, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, their intersection must be trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q.\n\nNow, we know that P has order 8 and Q has order 5. The only abelian groups of order 8 are C8 and C4 × C2, and the only group of order 5 is C5. Since Q is normal in G, we can use the following isomorphism theorems:\n\n1. If P ≅ C8, then G ≅ C8 × C5 ≅ C40.\n2. If P ≅ C4 × C2, then G ≅ (C4 × C2) × C5 ≅ C4 × (C2 × C5) ≅ C4 × C10 ≅ D20.\n\nIn both cases, G is isomorphic to an abelian group, either C40 or D20.\n\nNow, let's consider the non-abelian groups of order 40. There are eight such groups, which can be obtained by taking a non-abelian group of order 8, such as the dihedral group D4 or the quaternion group Q8, and forming the direct product with the cyclic group C5. In each case, the resulting group will have order 40 and will be non-abelian.\n\nIn summary, an arbitrary group of order 40 is isomorphic to either C40, D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. The isomorphism is ensured by the properties of the Sylow subgroups and the internal direct product structure of the group."
