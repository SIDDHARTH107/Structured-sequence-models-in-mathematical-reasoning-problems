    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we need to understand its structure. Since each vertex has degree 2 and there are 5 vertices, we can deduce that the graph must contain a cycle. In this case, the graph is a cycle of 5 vertices with an additional edge connecting two vertices.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) can be defined recursively as follows:\n\n1. If G has no edges, then T_G(x, y) = 1.\n2. If G has an edge e that is not a loop and not a bridge, then T_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y), where G-e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n3. If G has a loop e, then T_G(x, y) = x * T_{G-e}(x, y).\n4. If G has a bridge e, then T_G(x, y) = y * T_{G/e}(x, y).\n\nIn our case, the graph G has a cycle of 5 vertices (C5) and an additional edge e connecting two vertices. We can apply the second rule of the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y)\n\nG-e is a cycle of 5 vertices (C5), and G/e is a cycle of 4 vertices (C4). The Tutte polynomial of a cycle of n vertices is (x-1)^{n-1} * (y-1)^{n-1} + (x-1)^n * (y-1) + (x-1) * (y-1)^n.\n\nT_{C5}(x, y) = (x-1)^4 * (y-1)^4 + (x-1)^5 * (y-1) + (x-1) * (y-1)^5\nT_{C4}(x, y) = (x-1)^3 * (y-1)^3 + (x-1)^4 * (y-1) + (x-1) * (y-1)^4\n\nNow, substitute these values into the equation:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{C5}(x, y) + T_{C4}(x, y)\nT_G(x, y) = [(x-1)^4 * (y-1)^4 + (x-1)^5 * (y-1) + (x-1) * (y-1)^5] + [(x-1)^3 * (y-1)^3 + (x-1)^4 * (y-1) + (x-1) * (y-1)^4]\n\nThis is the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G."
