Let $f$ be a map from the sphere to itself, defined by reflecting each point of the sphere in the $xy$-plane. \n\nWhat is the homotopy class of $f$? In other words, what is the element of the fundamental group of the sphere represented by $f$?",
    "message_2": "To find the homotopy class of the map $f$, we need to determine the effect of the reflection on the fundamental group of the sphere. The fundamental group of the unit sphere $S^2$ is trivial, i.e., it has only one element, the identity element. This is because the sphere is simply connected, meaning that any loop on the sphere can be continuously deformed to a point.\n\nNow, let's consider the reflection map $f$. Given any loop on the sphere, reflecting it in the $xy$-plane will produce another loop on the sphere. Since the sphere is simply connected, both the original loop and its reflection can be continuously deformed to a point. Therefore, the reflection map $f$ does not change the homotopy class of any loop on the sphere.\n\nThus, the homotopy class of $f$ is the identity element of the fundamental group of the sphere, which is the trivial group."
