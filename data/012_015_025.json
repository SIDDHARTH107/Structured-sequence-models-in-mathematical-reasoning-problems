    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 9, so a connected graph must have at least 9-1 = 8 edges. Since G has 12 edges, it is possible that G is connected.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect G. In the worst-case scenario, G is a tree, which is a connected graph with no cycles. In a tree with 9 vertices, there are 8 edges. To disconnect a tree, we need to remove at least one edge. However, since G has 12 edges, there must be at least 4 cycles in G.\n\nTo disconnect G, we need to break all the cycles. In the worst-case scenario, each cycle shares at least one edge with another cycle. In this case, we can disconnect G by removing one edge from each cycle. Since there are at least 4 cycles, we need to remove at least 4 edges to disconnect G.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect G is 4."
