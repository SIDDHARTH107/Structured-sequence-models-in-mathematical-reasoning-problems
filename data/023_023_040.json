    "message_1": "A communication network requires a signal to be transmitted with a frequency of 500 Hz. The signal is modulated onto a carrier wave of frequency 10,000 Hz. Determine the frequency range of the modulated signal using Fourier analysis.",
    "message_2": "When a signal with frequency 500 Hz is modulated onto a carrier wave of frequency 10,000 Hz, the resulting modulated signal will have sidebands at the sum and difference of the carrier and signal frequencies. This is a result of the modulation process, which can be analyzed using Fourier analysis.\n\nThe lower sideband frequency is the difference between the carrier and signal frequencies:\nLower sideband frequency = Carrier frequency - Signal frequency\nLower sideband frequency = 10,000 Hz - 500 Hz = 9,500 Hz\n\nThe upper sideband frequency is the sum of the carrier and signal frequencies:\nUpper sideband frequency = Carrier frequency + Signal frequency\nUpper sideband frequency = 10,000 Hz + 500 Hz = 10,500 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency range of the modulated signal is from 9,500 Hz to 10,500 Hz."
