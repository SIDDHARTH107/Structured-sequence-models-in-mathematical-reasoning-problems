    "message_1": "Suppose two players participate in a Dictator Game, where Player A is given $100 and must offer a certain amount to Player B. If Player B accepts the offer, they both keep their portions of the money as agreed upon. If Player B rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. What offer should Player A make to maximize their chances of Player B accepting the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the optimal strategy for Player A to maximize their chances of Player B accepting the offer would be to offer an amount that is perceived as fair by Player B. Although there is no definitive answer to what is considered fair, research has shown that offers around 50% of the total amount ($50 in this case) are more likely to be accepted by Player B. This is because people tend to value fairness and are more likely to accept offers that they perceive as equitable. However, it is important to note that individual preferences and cultural factors may also influence what is considered a fair offer."
