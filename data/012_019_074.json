    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color. In this case, we can find the chromatic index of G by trying to color its edges with the minimum number of colors.\n\nFirst, let's try with 3 colors: red, blue, and green.\n\n```\n   1---2\n  /|\\  |\\\nr |g  |b\n  \\|/  |/|\n   3---4-5\n```\n\nColor the edge 1-2 with red, the edge 1-3 with green, and the edge 1-4 with blue. Now, we need to color the remaining edges.\n\n```\n   1---2\n  /|\\  |\\\nr |g  |b\n  \\|/  |/|\n   3---4-5\n    r  b g\n```\n\nColor the edge 3-4 with red, the edge 4-5 with green, and the edge 2-5 with blue. Now, we have one edge left: 2-4. However, all three colors are already used by the edges adjacent to it. Therefore, we cannot color the graph with 3 colors.\n\nNow let's try with 4 colors: red, blue, green, and yellow.\n\n```\n   1---2\n  /|\\  |\\\nr |g  |b\n  \\|/  |/|\n   3---4-5\n    r  b g\n```\n\nColor the edges as before: 1-2 with red, 1-3 with green, 1-4 with blue, 3-4 with red, 4-5 with green, and 2-5 with blue. Now, we can color the last edge, 2-4, with yellow.\n\n```\n   1---2\n  /|\\  |\\\nr |g  |b\n  \\|/  |/|\n   3---4-5\n    r  b g\n     y\n```\n\nThus, the chromatic index of G is 4, as we can color its edges with 4 colors such that no two adjacent edges have the same color."
