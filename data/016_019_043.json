    "message_2": "A Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve construction process to each side of an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, every line segment is divided into four new segments, so the number of line segments increases by a factor of 4.\n\nAfter the 1st iteration, there are 3 * 4 = 12 line segments.\nAfter the 2nd iteration, there are 12 * 4 = 48 line segments.\nAfter the 3rd iteration, there are 48 * 4 = 192 line segments.\nAfter the 4th iteration, there are 192 * 4 = 768 line segments.\n\nSo, after the 4th iteration of the construction process, there will be 768 line segments in the Koch island."
