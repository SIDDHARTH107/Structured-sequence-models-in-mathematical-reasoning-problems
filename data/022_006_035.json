    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| on the closed unit disc, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) on a closed and bounded region, then the maximum value of the modulus of the function occurs on the boundary of the region.\n\nIn this case, the boundary of the closed unit disc is the unit circle, defined by |z| = 1. We can parameterize the unit circle using z = e^(it), where t is a real parameter and 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.\n\nNow, let's substitute z = e^(it) into f(z):\n\nf(e^(it)) = (e^(it))^3 - 6(e^(it))^2 + 11(e^(it)) - 6\n= e^(3it) - 6e^(2it) + 11e^(it) - 6\n\nNow, we will find the modulus of f(e^(it)):\n\n|f(e^(it))| = |e^(3it) - 6e^(2it) + 11e^(it) - 6|\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of |f(e^(it))|, we can differentiate it with respect to t and find the critical points:\n\nd|f(e^(it))|/dt = 0\n\nHowever, finding the derivative of the modulus of a complex function is not straightforward. Instead, we can consider the square of the modulus, which will have the same critical points:\n\n|f(e^(it))|^2 = (e^(3it) - 6e^(2it) + 11e^(it) - 6)(e^(-3it) - 6e^(-2it) + 11e^(-it) - 6)\n\nNow, we can differentiate |f(e^(it))|^2 with respect to t and find the critical points:\n\nd|f(e^(it))|^2/dt = 0\n\nSolving this equation analytically is quite challenging. However, we can use numerical methods to find the critical points and evaluate |f(e^(it))| at those points.\n\nAfter finding the critical points, we can compare the values of |f(e^(it))| at those points and the values at the endpoints (t = 0 and t = 2π) to determine the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| on the closed unit disc."
