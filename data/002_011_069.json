    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of 6 cm and a height of 8 cm. Determine the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the base (a) is 6 cm and the height (b) is 8 cm. The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc² = (6 cm)² + (8 cm)²\nc² = 36 cm² + 64 cm²\nc² = 100 cm²\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √(100 cm²)\nc = 10 cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm."
