The factory can operate for 8 hours per day. Let x be the number of hours the first machine is used and y be the number of hours the second machine is used. If the profit per unit is $10 for the first machine and $12 for the second machine, what is the optimal production strategy that maximizes the profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The first machine produces 200 units per hour and has a profit of $10 per unit.\n2. The second machine produces 150 units per hour and has a profit of $12 per unit.\n3. The factory can operate for 8 hours per day.\n\nLet's set up the constraints and the objective function.\n\nConstraints:\n1. The total operating time of both machines cannot exceed 8 hours: x + y ≤ 8\n2. The operating time for each machine cannot be negative: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nObjective function (profit):\nP(x, y) = 10(200x) + 12(150y) = 2000x + 1800y\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) subject to the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 8\n   y ≤ -x + 8\n\nThe feasible region is the area below the line y = -x + 8, including the axes x = 0 and y = 0.\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraints intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of x + y = 8 and x = 0: (0, 8)\n2. Intersection of x + y = 8 and y = 0: (8, 0)\n3. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 8) = 2000(0) + 1800(8) = $14,400\n2. P(8, 0) = 2000(8) + 1800(0) = $16,000\n3. P(0, 0) = 2000(0) + 1800(0) = $0\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (8, 0), with a profit of $16,000.\n\nTherefore, the optimal production strategy is to use the first machine for 8 hours and not use the second machine at all. This will result in a maximum profit of $16,000 per day."
