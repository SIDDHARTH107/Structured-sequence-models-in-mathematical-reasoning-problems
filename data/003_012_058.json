    "message_1": "A 25-meter ladder is leaning against a wall. If the foot of the ladder is 7 meters away from the wall, what is the angle of elevation of the ladder from the ground?",
    "message_2": "We can use the right triangle trigonometry to solve this problem. Let's denote the angle of elevation of the ladder from the ground as θ.\n\nWe have a right triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse (25 meters), the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall as the adjacent side (7 meters), and the height from the ground to the point where the ladder touches the wall as the opposite side. Let's denote the height as h.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height (h):\n\nh^2 + 7^2 = 25^2\nh^2 + 49 = 625\nh^2 = 576\nh = √576\nh = 24\n\nNow that we have the height (h = 24 meters), we can use the tangent function to find the angle θ:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(θ) = h/7\ntan(θ) = 24/7\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse tangent (arctangent) of both sides:\n\nθ = arctan(24/7)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 73.74°\n\nSo, the angle of elevation of the ladder from the ground is approximately 73.74°."
