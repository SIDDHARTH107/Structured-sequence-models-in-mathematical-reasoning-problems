    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate the average age of its employees. They have a total of 500 employees, but they can only afford to survey a sample of 50 employees. Using simple random sampling, they randomly select 50 employees from the list of all 500 employees. The ages (in years) of the selected employees are as follows: \n\n{25, 27, 36, 31, 42, 22, 40, 34, 28, 29, 26, 39, 44, 31, 27, 37, 30, 30, 26, 33, 28, 33, 35, 41, 30, 24, 35, 39, 37, 26, 32, 38, 29, 30, 45, 34, 31, 28, 27, 38, 36, 43, 35, 23, 29, 31, 27, 32, 30, 36}\n\nWhat is the sample mean age of the employees in the company? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
