    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{27}$, we look for the largest perfect square that divides 27. The largest perfect square that divides 27 is 9. We can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$\\sqrt{27} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 3}$\n\nSince the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$\\sqrt{27} = \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{3}$\n\nNow, we know that $\\sqrt{9} = 3$, so we have:\n\n$\\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}$"
