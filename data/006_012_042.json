    "message_2": "To find the probability of a robbery occurring in the neighborhood, we can use the historical data provided. \n\nThere are 10 robberies reported per year in a neighborhood with 1000 households. To find the probability, we can divide the number of robberies by the number of households:\n\nProbability of a robbery = (Number of robberies) / (Number of households) \n\nProbability of a robbery = 10 / 1000 \n\nProbability of a robbery = 0.01 \n\nSo, the probability of a robbery occurring in the neighborhood is 0.01 or 1%."
