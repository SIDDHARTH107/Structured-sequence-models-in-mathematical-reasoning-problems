    "message_2": "To find the angle between the two planes, we first need to find the angle between their direction vectors A and B. We can use the dot product formula to find the angle between the two vectors:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of the two vectors, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nA · B = (4)(2) + (5)(3) + (6)(-1) = 8 + 15 - 6 = 17\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the two vectors:\n\n|A| = √(4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2) = √(16 + 25 + 36) = √77\n|B| = √(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = √(4 + 9 + 1) = √14\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n17 = (√77)(√14)cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 17 / (√77 * √14) ≈ 0.529\n\nθ = arccos(0.529) ≈ 58.2 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two planes is approximately 58 degrees."
