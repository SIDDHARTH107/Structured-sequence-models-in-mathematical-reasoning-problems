    "message_1": "A wire has a current of 4 A flowing through it and is placed at a distance of 3 cm from a point charge of 2 µC. Find the electric potential at 5 cm from the point charge using the Fourier transform method.",
    "message_2": "The Fourier transform method is not applicable to this problem, as it is used for solving partial differential equations and analyzing functions and signals. Instead, we can use the basic concepts of electric potential to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for electric potential (V) due to a point charge (q):\n\nV = k * q / r\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant (approximately 8.99 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2), q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge.\n\nGiven that the point charge is 2 µC, we can convert it to coulombs:\n\n2 µC = 2 × 10^-6 C\n\nNow, we can find the electric potential at 5 cm from the point charge:\n\nV = (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * (2 × 10^-6 C) / (5 × 10^-2 m)\nV = 17.98 × 10^3 N m C^-1\nV = 17.98 kV\n\nSo, the electric potential at 5 cm from the point charge is 17.98 kV."
