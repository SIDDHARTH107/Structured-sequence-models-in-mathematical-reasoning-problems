    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to $X$, we will use the Leibniz rule for tensor fields. The Leibniz rule states that for a tensor field $T$ of type $(r, s)$ and a vector field $X$, the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to $X$ is given by:\n\n$$(\\nabla_X T)(Y_1, \\dots, Y_r, Z^1, \\dots, Z^s) = X(T(Y_1, \\dots, Y_r, Z^1, \\dots, Z^s)) - \\sum_{i=1}^r T(Y_1, \\dots, \\nabla_X Y_i, \\dots, Y_r, Z^1, \\dots, Z^s) + \\sum_{j=1}^s T(Y_1, \\dots, Y_r, Z^1, \\dots, \\nabla_X Z^j, \\dots, Z^s)$$\n\nIn our case, $T = (f+xy)X\\otimes Y$ is a tensor field of type $(1, 1)$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$(\\nabla_X T)(Y, Z) = X((f+xy)X(Y)Z) - T(\\nabla_X Y, Z) + T(Y, \\nabla_X Z)$$\n\nNow, let's compute the terms on the right-hand side:\n\n1. $X((f+xy)X(Y)Z) = X((f+xy)g(X,Y)Z) = g(X,Y)X((f+xy)Z) = g(X,Y)(X(f+xy)Z)$, where $g$ is the metric tensor on $M$.\n\n2. $T(\\nabla_X Y, Z) = (f+xy)X(\\nabla_X Y)Z = (f+xy)g(X, \\nabla_X Y)Z$\n\n3. $T(Y, \\nabla_X Z) = (f+xy)X(Y)g(X, \\nabla_X Z) = (f+xy)g(X, Y)X(\\nabla_X Z)$\n\nNow, substitute these terms back into the Leibniz rule:\n\n$$(\\nabla_X T)(Y, Z) = g(X,Y)(X(f+xy)Z) - (f+xy)g(X, \\nabla_X Y)Z + (f+xy)g(X, Y)X(\\nabla_X Z)$$\n\nThis is the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to $X$."
