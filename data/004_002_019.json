    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 4x + 1) / (2x^2 - 3x + 1) as x approaches 2, we can simply substitute the value of x into the function and simplify:\n\nf(2) = (3(2)^2 - 4(2) + 1) / (2(2)^2 - 3(2) + 1)\n\nf(2) = (3(4) - 8 + 1) / (2(4) - 6 + 1)\n\nf(2) = (12 - 8 + 1) / (8 - 6 + 1)\n\nf(2) = (5) / (3)\n\nf(2) = 5/3\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches 2 is 5/3."
