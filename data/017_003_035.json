    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince |G| = 5 and 5 is a prime number, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and 5.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G such that g ≠ e (where e is the identity element). Since the order of the subgroup generated by g must divide 5, and the only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, the order of the subgroup generated by g cannot be 1 (otherwise, g would be the identity element, which contradicts our assumption that g ≠ e).\n\nTherefore, the order of the subgroup generated by g must be 5. This means that the subgroup generated by g contains 5 elements, which are {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4}. Since G also has 5 elements, the subgroup generated by g must be equal to G. Thus, G is cyclic, and g is a generator of G."
