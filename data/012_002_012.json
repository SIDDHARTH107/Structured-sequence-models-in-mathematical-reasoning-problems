    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of the given graph, we can try to color the vertices using the minimum number of colors while ensuring that no adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nWe can color the graph as follows:\n\n1. Color A with color 1.\n2. Color B with color 2 (since it's adjacent to A).\n3. Color C with color 1 (since it's adjacent to B but not A).\n4. Color D with color 2 (since it's adjacent to A).\n5. Color E with color 3 (since it's adjacent to both A and B, which have colors 1 and 2).\n6. Color F with color 2 (since it's adjacent to C and E, which have colors 1 and 3).\n\nThe coloring is now complete, and we used 3 colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of the given graph is 3."
