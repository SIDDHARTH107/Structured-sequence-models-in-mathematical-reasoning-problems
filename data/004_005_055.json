    "message_2": "To find the general solution to the differential equation dy/dx = 3x^2, we need to integrate both sides with respect to x.\n\n∫(dy/dx) dx = ∫(3x^2) dx\n\nIntegrating the left side with respect to x gives:\n\ny(x) = ∫(3x^2) dx\n\nNow, we integrate the right side:\n\ny(x) = x^3 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution using the initial condition y(0) = 5. Substitute x = 0 and y = 5 into the general solution:\n\n5 = (0)^3 + C\n\n5 = C\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(x) = x^3 + 5"
