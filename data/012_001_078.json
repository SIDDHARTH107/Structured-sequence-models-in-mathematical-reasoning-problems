    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distance to all other nodes to infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (node 1) and mark it as visited.\n\n3. Update the distances of its neighbors (nodes 2 and 3). The distance to node 2 is 2 and the distance to node 3 is 4.\n\n4. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 2) and mark it as visited.\n\n5. Update the distances of its neighbors (nodes 4 and 5). The distance to node 4 is 2 + 5 = 7 and the distance to node 5 is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n6. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 5) and mark it as visited.\n\n7. Update the distance of its neighbor (node 6). The distance to node 6 is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n8. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 3) and mark it as visited. No distance updates are needed since node 5 has already been visited.\n\n9. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 4) and mark it as visited. Update the distance of its neighbor (node 6). The distance to node 6 is 7 + 6 = 13, which is greater than the current distance of 4, so no update is needed.\n\n10. Finally, select the last unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 6) and mark it as visited.\n\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 with a total weight of 4."
