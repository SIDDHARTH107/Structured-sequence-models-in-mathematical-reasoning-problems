    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method for minimizing a function, we need to find the critical points of the function by setting its derivative equal to zero and then iterate using the following formula:\n\nx_{n+1} = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of f(x):\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x\nf''(x) = 6x - 6\n\nNow, let's apply Newton's method with the initial guess x_0 = 2:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0)\nx_1 = 2 - (3(2)^2 - 6(2)) / (6(2) - 6)\nx_1 = 2 - (12 - 12) / (12 - 6)\nx_1 = 2 - 0 / 6\nx_1 = 2\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1)\nx_2 = 2 - (3(2)^2 - 6(2)) / (6(2) - 6)\nx_2 = 2 - (12 - 12) / (12 - 6)\nx_2 = 2 - 0 / 6\nx_2 = 2\n\nSince x_1 and x_2 are the same, we have converged to the minimum value of f(x). Now let's find the minimum value of f(x) at x = 2:\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 4\nf(2) = 8 - 12 + 4\nf(2) = 0\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) is 0, correct to three decimal places."
