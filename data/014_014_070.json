    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"ATTACK AT DAWN\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"SECRET\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the keyword:\n   Remove duplicate letters from the keyword and fill the matrix row by row. Fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is combined with 'I').\n\n   S E C R T\n   A B D F G\n   H I K L M\n   N O P Q U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n2. Prepare the plaintext for encryption:\n   - Replace 'J' with 'I' (if any).\n   - Break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letters, insert an 'X' between them and continue with the next pair.\n   - If the plaintext has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\n   The prepared plaintext is: AT TA CK AT DA WX N\n\n3. Encrypt each digraph using the Playfair matrix:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its right (wrap around if needed).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter below it (wrap around if needed).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each with the letter in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\n   AT -> SE\n   TA -> CR\n   CK -> UF\n   AT -> SE\n   DA -> RG\n   WX -> TN\n   N -> N\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the ciphertext:\n\n   The resulting ciphertext is: SECRUFSE RGTN\n\nNote: Spaces are added for readability; they are not part of the ciphertext."
