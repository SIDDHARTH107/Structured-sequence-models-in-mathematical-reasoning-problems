    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nSo, for f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(5x)/dx + d(2)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3 * d(x^2)/dx - 5 * d(x)/dx + 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0)\n\nNow, applying the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = 3 * (2 * x^(2-1)) - 5 * (1 * x^(1-1))\n\nf'(x) = 3 * (2 * x^1) - 5 * (1 * x^0)\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 5\n\nNow, we want to find the derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 5\n\nf'(2) = 12 - 5\n\nf'(2) = 7\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 at the point x = 2 is 7."
