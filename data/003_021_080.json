    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an elevation of 1200 meters and heading east. Another plane is flying at an elevation of 800 meters and heading north. If the distance between the planes is 1500 meters, what is the angle between their flight paths (rounded to the nearest degree)? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the flight paths, we can use the cosine rule in a triangle formed by the two planes and the ground. Let's denote the angle between the flight paths as θ.\n\nWe have a triangle with sides 1200 meters, 800 meters, and 1500 meters. Let's denote these sides as a, b, and c respectively. So, a = 1200, b = 800, and c = 1500.\n\nAccording to the cosine rule, we have:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(θ)\n\nRearranging the formula to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (a² + b² - c²) / (2ab)\n\nNow, substitute the values of a, b, and c:\n\ncos(θ) = (1200² + 800² - 1500²) / (2 * 1200 * 800)\n\ncos(θ) = (1440000 + 640000 - 2250000) / (1920000)\n\ncos(θ) = -100000 / 1920000\n\nθ = arccos(-100000 / 1920000)\n\nθ ≈ 94.5 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the flight paths is approximately 95 degrees."
