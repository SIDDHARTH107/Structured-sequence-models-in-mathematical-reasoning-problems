    "message_1": "Suppose a bakery has 50 kilograms of flour and 30 kilograms of sugar to make two types of cakes: chocolate and vanilla. Each chocolate cake requires 1 kilogram of flour and 0.5 kilograms of sugar, while each vanilla cake requires 0.5 kilograms of flour and 0.25 kilograms of sugar. The profit from each chocolate cake is $10 and the profit from each vanilla cake is $7. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the bakery can make if they want to use up all their flour and sugar?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chocolate cakes and y be the number of vanilla cakes. We have the following constraints:\n\n1x + 0.5y ≤ 50 (flour constraint)\n0.5x + 0.25y ≤ 30 (sugar constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 7y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. Flour constraint:\ny ≤ 100 - 2x\n\n2. Sugar constraint:\ny ≤ 120 - 2x\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. We have the following intersections:\n\n1. Intersection of flour constraint and sugar constraint:\n100 - 2x = 120 - 2x\nx = 10\n\nSo, the intersection point is (10, 80).\n\n2. Intersection of flour constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\ny = 100 - 2(0) = 100\n\nSo, the intersection point is (0, 100).\n\n3. Intersection of sugar constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n0 = 120 - 2x\nx = 60\n\nSo, the intersection point is (60, 0).\n\nNow we need to check the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(10, 80) = 10(10) + 7(80) = 100 + 560 = $660\nP(0, 100) = 10(0) + 7(100) = $700\nP(60, 0) = 10(60) + 7(0) = $600\n\nThe maximum profit is $700 when the bakery makes 0 chocolate cakes and 100 vanilla cakes."
