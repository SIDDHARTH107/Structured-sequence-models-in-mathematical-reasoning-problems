    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to determine the girth of G, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * (number of edges) / (number of vertices)\n\nIn this case, the number of vertices is 10 and the number of edges is 15. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * (15) / (10)\ngirth(G) ≤ 3\n\nSince the girth of a graph must be an integer, and the smallest cycle in a graph has a length of 3, the girth of G is 3."
