    "message_2": "Let p: Y → X be the covering map. Since Y is a covering space of X, we know that the fundamental group of Y, π(Y), is a subgroup of the fundamental group of X, π(X). We are given that π(Y) = Z × 𝔽, where Z is the cyclic group of order 27 and 𝔽 is the free group on two generators.\n\nRecall the following facts:\n\n1. The index of a subgroup is equal to the number of its cosets.\n2. The index of π(Y) in π(X) is equal to the number of sheets in the covering space Y over X.\n3. The covering space Y is connected, so the index of π(Y) in π(X) is also the degree of the covering map p.\n\nLet's denote the index of π(Y) in π(X) by n, i.e., n = [π(X) : π(Y)]. Since Y is connected, we know that n is the degree of the covering map p. Now, we will use the fact that X is locally path-connected and semi-locally simply-connected.\n\nSince X is locally path-connected, we know that the covering space Y is also locally path-connected. Furthermore, since X is semi-locally simply-connected, there exists an open neighborhood U of the basepoint x0 in X such that any loop in U is null-homotopic in X. This implies that the restriction of the covering map p to the preimage p^(-1)(U) is a trivial covering, i.e., it is a disjoint union of n copies of U.\n\nNow, consider the action of π(X) on the fiber p^(-1)(x0) over the basepoint x0. Since the covering map p is a regular covering, the action of π(X) on p^(-1)(x0) is transitive and free. This means that the stabilizer of any point in p^(-1)(x0) is isomorphic to π(Y).\n\nLet's denote the stabilizer of a point y0 in p^(-1)(x0) by Stab(y0). Then, we have:\n\nπ(Y) = Stab(y0) ≤ π(X)\n\nBy the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have:\n\nn = [π(X) : π(Y)] = |Orb(y0)|\n\nwhere Orb(y0) is the orbit of y0 under the action of π(X). Since the action of π(X) on p^(-1)(x0) is transitive, we have |Orb(y0)| = |p^(-1)(x0)|, which is the number of sheets in the covering space Y over X.\n\nNow, we know that π(Y) is a subgroup of π(X) with index n. By the Schreier index formula, we have:\n\n|π(X)| = |π(Y)| × n\n\nSince π(Y) = Z × 𝔽, we have |π(Y)| = 27 × ∞ = ∞. Therefore, |π(X)| = ∞ × n = ∞. This means that π(X) is an infinite group.\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the exact structure of π(X) from the given information. The fundamental group π(X) is an infinite group that contains π(Y) = Z × 𝔽 as a subgroup of index n, but without more information about the covering space Y or the topological space X, we cannot uniquely determine π(X)."
