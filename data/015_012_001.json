    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (λ) for the Lorenz Attractor can be estimated numerically. The Lorenz Attractor is a set of three differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\ndy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y\ndz/dt = xy - βz\n\nwhere σ, β, and ρ are the parameters given.\n\nFor the given parameters (σ = 10, β = 8/3, and ρ = 28), the largest Lyapunov exponent (λ) is approximately 0.90. This value indicates that the Lorenz Attractor exhibits chaotic behavior for these parameter values."
