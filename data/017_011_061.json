    "message_1": "How many distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 12 are there, and what are they?",
    "message_2": "There are five distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 12. They are as follows:\n\n1. C_12: The cyclic group of order 12. It is generated by a single element, and all elements have orders that divide 12.\n\n2. C_6 Ã— C_2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 6 and a cyclic group of order 2. This group has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n3. A_4: The alternating group on 4 elements. This group consists of all even permutations of 4 elements and has order 12. It is non-abelian and has elements of orders 1, 2, and 3.\n\n4. D_6: The dihedral group of order 12. This group represents the symmetries of a regular hexagon, including rotations and reflections. It is non-abelian and has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n5. Q_12: The dicyclic group of order 12. This group is non-abelian and has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. It can be thought of as a generalization of the quaternion group.\n\nThese five groups represent all the distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 12."
