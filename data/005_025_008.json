    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to estimate the average weight of a certain product package. A random sample of 35 packages is selected, and their mean weight is found to be 12 oz with a standard deviation of 1.5 oz. With a 95% level of confidence, what is the margin of error for the estimation of the average weight of the package?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the margin of error for the estimation of the average weight of the package with a 95% level of confidence, we will use the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = Z * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size)\n\nwhere Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% level of confidence, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nGiven:\nMean weight = 12 oz\nStandard deviation = 1.5 oz\nSample size = 35\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (1.5 / √35)\n\nMargin of Error ≈ 1.96 * (1.5 / 5.916)\n\nMargin of Error ≈ 1.96 * 0.2536\n\nMargin of Error ≈ 0.4971\n\nThe margin of error for the estimation of the average weight of the package with a 95% level of confidence is approximately 0.4971 oz."
