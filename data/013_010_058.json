    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium quantity and price for each firm under Cournot competition, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the profit function for each firm.\n2. Calculate the reaction function for each firm.\n3. Find the Nash equilibrium by solving the system of reaction functions.\n\nStep 1: Determine the profit function for each firm\nProfit = Total Revenue - Total Cost\nLet q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. Then, the total quantity Q = q1 + q2. The market price P = 50 - Q = 50 - (q1 + q2).\n\nTotal Revenue for firm 1 = P * q1 = (50 - (q1 + q2)) * q1\nTotal Cost for firm 1 = C(q1) = 10 * q1\n\nProfit for firm 1 = π1 = (50 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 10 * q1\n\nSimilarly, for firm 2:\nTotal Revenue for firm 2 = P * q2 = (50 - (q1 + q2)) * q2\nTotal Cost for firm 2 = C(q2) = 10 * q2\n\nProfit for firm 2 = π2 = (50 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 10 * q2\n\nStep 2: Calculate the reaction function for each firm\nTo find the reaction function, we need to maximize the profit function with respect to each firm's quantity, taking the other firm's quantity as given.\n\nFor firm 1, take the first-order derivative of π1 with respect to q1 and set it equal to 0:\ndπ1/dq1 = (50 - q1 - q2) - q1 - 10 = 0\n\nFor firm 2, take the first-order derivative of π2 with respect to q2 and set it equal to 0:\ndπ2/dq2 = (50 - q1 - q2) - q2 - 10 = 0\n\nStep 3: Find the Nash equilibrium by solving the system of reaction functions\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns (q1 and q2):\n\n40 - 2q1 - q2 = 0 (1)\n40 - q1 - 2q2 = 0 (2)\n\nSolve equation (1) for q1:\nq1 = 20 - (1/2)q2\n\nSubstitute this expression for q1 into equation (2):\n40 - (20 - (1/2)q2) - 2q2 = 0\n20 + (1/2)q2 - 2q2 = 0\n(1/2)q2 = 20\nq2 = 40\n\nNow substitute q2 back into the expression for q1:\nq1 = 20 - (1/2)(40)\nq1 = 20 - 20\nq1 = 0\n\nHowever, this solution does not make sense in the context of Cournot competition, as it implies that firm 1 produces nothing. We made an error in our calculations. Let's go back to the reaction functions and solve them again:\n\n40 - 2q1 - q2 = 0 (1)\n40 - q1 - 2q2 = 0 (2)\n\nSolve equation (1) for q2:\nq2 = 40 - 2q1\n\nSubstitute this expression for q2 into equation (2):\n40 - q1 - 2(40 - 2q1) = 0\n40 - q1 - 80 + 4q1 = 0\n3q1 = 40\nq1 = 40/3\n\nNow substitute q1 back into the expression for q2:\nq2 = 40 - 2(40/3)\nq2 = 40 - 80/3\nq2 = 40/3\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium quantities for each firm are q1 = 40/3 and q2 = 40/3.\n\nTo find the equilibrium price, substitute these quantities back into the market price equation:\nP = 50 - (q1 + q2)\nP = 50 - (40/3 + 40/3)\nP = 50 - 80/3\nP = 50/3\n\nThe Nash equilibrium under Cournot competition is q1 = 40/3, q2 = 40/3, and P = 50/3."
