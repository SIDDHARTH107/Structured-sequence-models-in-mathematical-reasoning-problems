    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 2x^2 + 6x\nFactor out the common factor 2x: 2x(x + 3)\n\nDenominator: 8x^2 + 12x\nFactor out the common factor 4x: 4x(2x + 3)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(2x(x + 3)) / (4x(2x + 3))\n\nWe can see that both the numerator and the denominator have common factors (x + 3) and x. We can cancel out these common factors:\n\n(2~~x~~(~~x + 3~~)) / (4~~x~~(~~2x + 3~~))\n\nAfter canceling out the common factors, we are left with:\n\n2 / 4\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:\n\n(2/2) / (4/2)\n\n1 / 2\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n1/2"
