    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 40: 40 = 2^3 * 5^1\n2. Determine the number of possible divisors for each prime factor: For 2^3, there are 1, 2, and 3 as possible divisors. For 5^1, there is only 1 as a possible divisor.\n3. Use the formula for the number of abelian groups of a given order: (p^(n-1) * (p^n - 1)) / (p - 1), where p is a prime factor and n is its exponent in the prime factorization. In this case, we have two prime factors: 2 and 5.\n\nFor 2^3:\n(2^(3-1) * (2^3 - 1)) / (2 - 1) = (4 * 7) / 1 = 28\n\nFor 5^1:\n(5^(1-1) * (5^1 - 1)) / (5 - 1) = (1 * 4) / 4 = 1\n\n4. Multiply the results from step 3 for each prime factor: 28 * 1 = 28\n5. Use the formula for the number of non-abelian groups of a given order: (number of groups of order n) - (number of abelian groups of order n). In this case, we have:\n\nNumber of groups of order 40 = 5 (according to the OEIS sequence A000001)\nNumber of abelian groups of order 40 = 28 (from step 4)\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 40 = 5 - 28 = -23\n\nSince the number of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups cannot be negative, there must be an error in the calculations. Let's re-examine the steps.\n\nThe error is in step 3, where we used the formula for the number of abelian groups of a given order. This formula is incorrect. The correct formula is the product of the number of partitions of each exponent in the prime factorization.\n\nFor 2^3, there are 3 partitions: (3), (2, 1), and (1, 1, 1), so there are 3 abelian groups.\nFor 5^1, there is only 1 partition: (1), so there is 1 abelian group.\n\nNow, multiply the results for each prime factor: 3 * 1 = 3\n\nThere are 3 abelian groups of order 40. Now, we can use the formula for the number of non-abelian groups of a given order:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 40 = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 40."
