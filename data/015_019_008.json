    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a nonlinear dynamical system that is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, px, py) = 1/2 (px^2 + py^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - 1/3*y^3\n\nwhere x and y are the coordinates of the particle, and px and py are the corresponding momenta. The equations of motion for this system are given by Hamilton's equations:\n\ndx/dt = ∂H/∂px = px\ndy/dt = ∂H/∂py = py\ndpx/dt = -∂H/∂x = -x - 2*x*y\ndpy/dt = -∂H/∂y = -y - x^2 + y^2\n\nTo find the maximum amplitude reached by the x-coordinate of the particle, we need to solve these equations numerically with the given initial conditions (x(0) = 0.5, dx/dt(0) = 1.2, y(0) = 0, dy/dt(0) = 0) and find the maximum value of x(t) over the duration of 100 time units.\n\nThis is a numerical problem that requires a computer to solve. You can use numerical integration methods like the Runge-Kutta method to solve the system of equations and find the maximum amplitude of the x-coordinate."
