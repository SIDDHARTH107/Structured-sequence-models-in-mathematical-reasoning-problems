    "message_2": "To solve the integral of the function f(x) = 3sin(4x)cos(4x), we can use the double angle formula for sine, which states that sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ). In this case, we have:\n\nf(x) = 3sin(4x)cos(4x) = 3/2 * 2sin(4x)cos(4x) = 3/2 * sin(8x)\n\nNow, we can integrate f(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫f(x)dx = ∫(3/2 * sin(8x))dx\n\nTo integrate this function, we use the formula ∫sin(ax)dx = (-1/a)cos(ax) + C, where a is a constant and C is the constant of integration. In this case, a = 8:\n\n∫(3/2 * sin(8x))dx = (3/2) * (-1/8)cos(8x) + C = (-3/16)cos(8x) + C"
