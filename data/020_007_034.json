The company has three machines and each machine can produce a certain number widgets per day:\n\nMachine 1: 20 widgets per day\nMachine 2: 30 widgets per day\nMachine 3: 25 widgets per day\n\nThe company receives orders for 75, 90, and 110 widgets per day on consecutive days. What is the minimum number of days needed to meet these orders, and what is the optimal production schedule? Assume that any machine can be used on any day, but a machine can't produce more than its daily maximum.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of days needed to meet these orders and the optimal production schedule, we need to maximize the daily production while meeting the daily demand.\n\nTotal demand: 75 + 90 + 110 = 275 widgets\nTotal daily production capacity: 20 + 30 + 25 = 75 widgets\n\nSince the total daily production capacity is equal to the smallest daily demand, it is possible to meet each day's demand in one day.\n\nDay 1: 75 widgets\n- Machine 1: 20 widgets\n- Machine 2: 30 widgets\n- Machine 3: 25 widgets\nTotal: 75 widgets\n\nDay 2: 90 widgets\n- Machine 1: 20 widgets\n- Machine 2: 30 widgets\n- Machine 3: 25 widgets\n- Machine 1 (next day): 15 widgets (20 - 5, since it can't produce more than its daily maximum)\nTotal: 90 widgets\n\nDay 3: 110 widgets\n- Machine 1: 20 widgets\n- Machine 2: 30 widgets\n- Machine 3: 25 widgets\n- Machine 1 (next day): 20 widgets\n- Machine 2 (next day): 15 widgets (30 - 15, since it can't produce more than its daily maximum)\nTotal: 110 widgets\n\nThe minimum number of days needed to meet these orders is 3 days, and the optimal production schedule is as follows:\n\nDay 1: Machine 1 (20), Machine 2 (30), Machine 3 (25)\nDay 2: Machine 1 (20), Machine 2 (30), Machine 3 (25), Machine 1 (next day, 15)\nDay 3: Machine 1 (20), Machine 2 (30), Machine 3 (25), Machine 1 (next day, 20), Machine 2 (next day, 15)"
