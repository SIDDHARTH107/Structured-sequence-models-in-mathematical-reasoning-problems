    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the given Schrödinger equation, we first rewrite it as:\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = (E - (1+x^2))\\psi $$\n\nThis is a Sturm-Liouville problem, and the solutions to this equation are not expressible in terms of elementary functions. However, we can use the properties of the Hermite polynomials to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\n\nThe Hermite polynomials are defined by the following differential equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2H_n(x)}{dx^2} - 2x\\frac{dH_n(x)}{dx} + 2nH_n(x) = 0 $$\n\nComparing this with the given Schrödinger equation, we can make the following ansatz:\n\n$$ \\psi(x) = e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x) $$\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2(e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x))}{dx^2} + (1+x^2)(e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x)) = E(e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x)) $$\n\nNow, we can use the properties of the Hermite polynomials to simplify this equation. The Hermite polynomials satisfy the following recursion relation:\n\n$$ H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_n(x) - 2nH_{n-1}(x) $$\n\nUsing this relation, we can write the second derivative of the ansatz as:\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = e^{-x^2/2} \\left[ (4n^2 - 4n + 2)H_n(x) - 4nxH_{n-1}(x) \\right] $$\n\nSubstituting this back into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n$$ e^{-x^2/2} \\left[ (4n^2 - 4n + 2)H_n(x) - 4nxH_{n-1}(x) \\right] + (1+x^2)(e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x)) = E(e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x)) $$\n\nNow, we can cancel the exponential term on both sides and rearrange the equation to get:\n\n$$ (4n^2 - 4n + 2)H_n(x) - 4nxH_{n-1}(x) + (1+x^2)H_n(x) = EH_n(x) $$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the Hermite polynomials, we can deduce the eigenvalues:\n\n$$ E_n = 4n^2 - 4n + 2 $$\n\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are given by:\n\n$$ \\psi_n(x) = e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x) $$\n\nThese eigenfunctions satisfy the boundary conditions $\\psi(-\\infty)=0$ and $\\psi(\\infty)=0$. Therefore, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the given Schrödinger equation are:\n\nEigenvalues: $$ E_n = 4n^2 - 4n + 2 $$\n\nEigenfunctions: $$ \\psi_n(x) = e^{-x^2/2} H_n(x) $$"
