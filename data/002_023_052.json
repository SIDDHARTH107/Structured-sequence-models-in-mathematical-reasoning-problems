    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the diameter of the sphere is 14 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 14 cm / 2 = 7 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (7 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 49 cm^2\nSurface area ≈ 4 * 3.14159 * 49 cm^2\nSurface area ≈ 12.56636 * 49 cm^2\nSurface area ≈ 615.752 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 615.752 cm^2."
