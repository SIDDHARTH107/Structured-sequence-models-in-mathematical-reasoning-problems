The actual diameter of the bolts is normally distributed with a mean of 2.98mm and a standard deviation of 0.03mm. \n\nIf a sample of 100 bolts is taken, what is the probability that the sample mean diameter is greater than 3mm? Use Bayesian statistics to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we need to find the probability of the sample mean diameter being greater than 3mm given the prior distribution of the actual diameter of the bolts. The prior distribution is normally distributed with a mean of 2.98mm and a standard deviation of 0.03mm.\n\nFirst, let's find the distribution of the sample mean. The sample mean of a normally distributed population is also normally distributed. The mean of the sample mean distribution is the same as the population mean, which is 2.98mm. The standard deviation of the sample mean distribution is the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (n):\n\nStandard deviation of sample mean = Population standard deviation / sqrt(n)\nStandard deviation of sample mean = 0.03mm / sqrt(100)\nStandard deviation of sample mean = 0.03mm / 10\nStandard deviation of sample mean = 0.003mm\n\nNow, we have the distribution of the sample mean: a normal distribution with a mean of 2.98mm and a standard deviation of 0.003mm.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the sample mean diameter is greater than 3mm. To do this, we'll use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\nz = (3mm - 2.98mm) / 0.003mm\nz = 0.02mm / 0.003mm\nz ≈ 6.67\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 6.67. Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being greater than 6.67 is extremely small (almost 0).\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean diameter is greater than 3mm is almost 0."
