    "message_2": "A) The group of invertible $4\\times4$ upper triangular matrices over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThis group is non-abelian. To see this, consider the following two matrices:\n\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTheir product is:\n\n$AB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $BA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSince $AB \\neq BA$, the group is non-abelian. This group is not isomorphic to the cyclic group C16 (which is abelian) or the dihedral group D8 (which has order 16 but is not non-abelian). Therefore, it must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nB) The direct product of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ with itself four times.\n\nThis group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. It is an abelian group, so it cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D8 or the non-abelian group of order 16. However, it is not isomorphic to the cyclic group C16 either, since it has four elements of order 2, while C16 has only one element of order 2. Thus, this group is not isomorphic to any of the given groups.\n\nC) The group of symmetries of a regular octagon.\n\nThis group is the dihedral group D8, which has order 16. It is isomorphic to itself.\n\nD) The group of permutations of four letters with two fixed points.\n\nThis group has order 6 (there are 6 ways to permute the remaining two letters), so it cannot be isomorphic to any of the given groups of order 16."
