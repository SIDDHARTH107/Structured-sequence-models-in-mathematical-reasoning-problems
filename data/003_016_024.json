    "message_1": "A sound wave with the equation y = 4sin(2πt - π/4) is transmitted through a medium. What is the phase shift of this wave?",
    "message_2": "The general equation for a sinusoidal wave is y = A*sin(Bt - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 4sin(2πt - π/4), we can see that the phase shift is C = π/4. The phase shift is positive, which means the wave is shifted to the right by π/4 radians."
