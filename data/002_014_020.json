    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 7 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 5 cm, w = 3 cm, and h = 7 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSA = 2(5)(3) + 2(5)(7) + 2(3)(7)\nSA = 30 + 70 + 42\nSA = 142 cmÂ²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 142 square centimeters."
