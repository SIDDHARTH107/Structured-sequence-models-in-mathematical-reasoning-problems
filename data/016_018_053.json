    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, at each step, we remove the middle third of the line, leaving 2 equal parts. So, N = 2. The scaling factor s is the length of each remaining part, which is 1/3 (since we remove the middle third).\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(1/3)\n\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, we can rewrite this as:\n\nHausdorff dimension = (log(2) / log(3))\n\nHausdorff dimension â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.6309."
