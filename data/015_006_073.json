    "message_2": "To find the largest Lyapunov exponent of the Hénon map, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the map. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\n$J(x_n, y_n) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x_{n+1}}{\\partial x_n} & \\frac{\\partial x_{n+1}}{\\partial y_n} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y_{n+1}}{\\partial x_n} & \\frac{\\partial y_{n+1}}{\\partial y_n} \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFor the given Hénon map, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\n$J(x_n, y_n) = \\begin{bmatrix} -2ax_n & 1 \\\\ b & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we need to compute the Lyapunov exponent. The largest Lyapunov exponent, λ, is given by the formula:\n\n$λ = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\log \\left\\lVert J(x_i, y_i) \\right\\rVert$\n\nwhere $\\left\\lVert J(x_i, y_i) \\right\\rVert$ is the norm of the Jacobian matrix at the point $(x_i, y_i)$.\n\nTo compute the largest Lyapunov exponent numerically, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial point $(x_0, y_0)$ in the phase space.\n2. Iterate the Hénon map for a large number of steps (e.g., 10,000) to reach the attractor.\n3. Iterate the Hénon map for another large number of steps (e.g., 10,000) and, for each step, compute the norm of the Jacobian matrix and accumulate the logarithm of the norm.\n4. Divide the accumulated logarithm by the total number of steps to obtain an estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent.\n\nUsing the given values of $a=1.4$ and $b=0.3$, and following the above procedure, the largest Lyapunov exponent for the Hénon map is approximately λ ≈ 0.42. Note that the exact value may vary slightly depending on the initial point chosen and the number of iterations used in the calculation."
