    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"MATHEMATICS,\" we can use the formula for permutations of a set with repeated elements. The word \"MATHEMATICS\" has 11 letters, with the following frequency of each letter:\n\nM: 2\nA: 2\nT: 2\nH: 1\nE: 1\nI: 1\nC: 1\nS: 1\n\nThe formula for permutations with repeated elements is:\n\nP(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of elements, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of each element.\n\nIn this case, n = 11, and the frequencies are:\n\nn1 = 2 (for M)\nn2 = 2 (for A)\nn3 = 2 (for T)\nn4 = 1 (for H)\nn5 = 1 (for E)\nn6 = 1 (for I)\nn7 = 1 (for C)\nn8 = 1 (for S)\n\nSo the formula becomes:\n\nP(11; 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 11! / (2! * 2! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!)\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n11! = 39,916,800\n2! = 2\n1! = 1\n\nSubstituting the factorials back into the formula:\n\nP(11; 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 39,916,800 / (2 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1)\n\nP(11; 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 39,916,800 / 8\n\nP(11; 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 4,989,600\n\nSo there are 4,989,600 different ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"MATHEMATICS\" with the two \"M's\" being indistinguishable."
