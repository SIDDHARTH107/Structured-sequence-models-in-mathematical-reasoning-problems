    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 2 < 11, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality:\n3x + 2 - 2 < 11 - 2\n3x < 9\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\n3x/3 < 9/3\nx < 3\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x < 3.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from -2 to 5 (or any range that includes 3).\n2. Place an open circle at 3, since x is strictly less than 3 (not equal to 3).\n3. Shade the region to the left of the open circle, indicating that all values of x less than 3 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n<---(---O---)--->\n-2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5\n\nWhere the open circle (O) is at 3, and the shaded region is to the left of the circle."
