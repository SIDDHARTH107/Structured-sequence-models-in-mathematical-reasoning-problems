    "message_2": "To find the expected value and variance of X(10), we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The SDE is a geometric Brownian motion, which has the following solution:\n\nX(t) = X(0) * exp((a - (b^2)/2) * t + b * W(t))\n\nwhere X(0) = 10, a = 0.05, b = 0.2, and W(t) is a Wiener process.\n\nNow, we can find the expected value and variance of X(10).\n\nExpected value E[X(10)]:\n\nE[X(10)] = E[X(0) * exp((a - (b^2)/2) * 10 + b * W(10))]\n         = X(0) * E[exp((a - (b^2)/2) * 10 + b * W(10))]\n\nSince W(t) is a Wiener process, E[W(t)] = 0. Therefore,\n\nE[X(10)] = X(0) * exp((a - (b^2)/2) * 10)\n         = 10 * exp((0.05 - (0.2^2)/2) * 10)\n         ≈ 10 * exp(0.5 * 10)\n         ≈ 10 * exp(5)\n         ≈ 148.41\n\nVariance Var[X(10)]:\n\nVar[X(10)] = E[X(10)^2] - (E[X(10)])^2\n\nFirst, we find E[X(10)^2]:\n\nE[X(10)^2] = E[(X(0) * exp((a - (b^2)/2) * 10 + b * W(10)))^2]\n           = X(0)^2 * E[exp(2 * ((a - (b^2)/2) * 10 + b * W(10)))]\n\nSince E[exp(2 * b * W(t))] = exp(2 * b^2 * t), we have\n\nE[X(10)^2] = X(0)^2 * exp(2 * (a - (b^2)/2) * 10) * exp(2 * b^2 * 10)\n           = 10^2 * exp(2 * (0.05 - (0.2^2)/2) * 10) * exp(2 * 0.2^2 * 10)\n           ≈ 100 * exp(10) * exp(8)\n           ≈ 29836.61\n\nNow, we can find the variance:\n\nVar[X(10)] = E[X(10)^2] - (E[X(10)])^2\n           ≈ 29836.61 - (148.41)^2\n           ≈ 29836.61 - 22012.65\n           ≈ 7823.96\n\nSo, the expected value of X(10) is approximately 148.41, and the variance of X(10) is approximately 7823.96."
