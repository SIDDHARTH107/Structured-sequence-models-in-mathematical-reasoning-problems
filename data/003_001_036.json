    "message_2": "To find the length of the opposite side in a right triangle, we can use the sine function. The sine function relates the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle. The formula is:\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 35 degrees and the hypotenuse is 10 units. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nsin(35) = opposite side / 10\n\nTo find the sine of 35 degrees, we can use a calculator:\n\nsin(35) ≈ 0.5736\n\nNow, we can solve for the opposite side:\n\n0.5736 = opposite side / 10\n\nTo isolate the opposite side, multiply both sides by 10:\n\nopposite side ≈ 0.5736 * 10\n\nopposite side ≈ 5.736\n\nSo, the length of the opposite side is approximately 5.736 units."
