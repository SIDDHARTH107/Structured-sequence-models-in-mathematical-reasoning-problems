    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo the prime. Let n_3 and n_2 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups, respectively.\n\nSince the order of G is 18 = 2 * 3^2, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_3 | 2 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nThe only possibility for n_3 is 1. This means there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which we'll call P. Since it's unique, it must be normal in G.\n\n2. n_2 | 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\nThe possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which we'll call Q. Since it's unique, it must be normal in G.\n\nNow we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIn this case, both P and Q are normal in G. We know that |P| = 9 and |Q| = 2. Since P and Q are normal, we can form the direct product of P and Q, which is a group of order 18. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9\nIn this case, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and we cannot guarantee that any of them are normal in G. However, we know that the Sylow 3-subgroup P is normal. Let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since |P| = 9 and |H| = 2, we have |PH| = |P||H| / |P ∩ H|. Since P and H have relatively prime orders, their intersection is trivial, i.e., |P ∩ H| = 1. Thus, |PH| = 18, which implies that PH = G.\n\nNow, consider the action of H on P by conjugation. Since P is normal in G, this action is well-defined. The action of H on P induces a homomorphism φ: H → Aut(P), where Aut(P) is the group of automorphisms of P. Since P is a cyclic group of order 9, Aut(P) is isomorphic to the group of units modulo 9, which is a cyclic group of order 6. The homomorphism φ maps H into Aut(P), so the image of φ is a subgroup of Aut(P) of order 2. Since Aut(P) is cyclic of order 6, it has a unique subgroup of order 2, which we'll call K.\n\nIf φ is surjective, then G is a semidirect product of P and H, and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18. If φ is not surjective, then the image of φ is a proper subgroup of K, which means that the image of φ is trivial. In this case, the action of H on P is trivial, and G is the direct product of P and H. Since P is a cyclic group of order 9 and H is a cyclic group of order 2, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6, depending on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and the action of the Sylow 2-subgroups on the Sylow 3-subgroups."
