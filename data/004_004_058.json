    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curve y = 2x + 3 and the x-axis in the interval [1, 5], we will integrate the function y = 2x + 3 with respect to x from 1 to 5.\n\nThe integral of the function y = 2x + 3 is given by:\n\nâˆ«(2x + 3) dx = x^2 + 3x + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the limits 1 and 5:\n\n(x^2 + 3x)|[1, 5] = (5^2 + 3*5) - (1^2 + 3*1) = (25 + 15) - (1 + 3) = 40 - 4 = 36\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curve y = 2x + 3 and the x-axis in the interval [1, 5] is 36 square units."
