    "message_2": "Let's use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(time / half-life)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nFinal Amount = 300 grams\nInitial Amount = 500 grams\ntime = 20 years\nhalf-life = x (this is what we want to find)\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\n300 = 500 * (1/2)^(20 / x)\n\nNow, we'll solve for x:\n\n300/500 = (1/2)^(20 / x)\n0.6 = (1/2)^(20 / x)\n\nTo solve for x, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.6) = log((1/2)^(20 / x))\n\nUsing the logarithm property log(a^b) = b*log(a), we get:\n\nlog(0.6) = (20 / x) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, we'll isolate x:\n\nx = 20 * log(1/2) / log(0.6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx â‰ˆ 33.21 years\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive substance is approximately 33.21 years."
