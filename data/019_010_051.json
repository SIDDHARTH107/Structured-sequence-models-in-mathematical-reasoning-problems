    "message_1": "Using Linear Logic, solve for the value of x in the equation: \n\n!(3x) ⊗ !(2x + 5) ⊸ !(x - 3) \n\n(Note: ⊗ represents \"tensor product,\" ⊸ represents \"implies,\" and ! represents \"of course\" or \"multiplicative negation.\")",
    "message_2": "Linear logic is a substructural logic that replaces the usual notion of logical conjunction with a weaker, more resource-sensitive one. It is not used for solving algebraic equations like the one you provided. Instead, it is used for reasoning about resources and concurrency in computer science, linguistics, and other fields.\n\nThe equation you provided seems to be a mix of linear logic symbols and algebraic expressions. To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a standard algebraic form. However, the given equation does not have a clear algebraic interpretation due to the mixing of linear logic symbols and algebraic expressions.\n\nIf you can provide a standard algebraic equation, I'd be happy to help you solve for x."
