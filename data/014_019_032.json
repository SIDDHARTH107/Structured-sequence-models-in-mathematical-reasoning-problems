    "message_2": "To encrypt the plain text message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a 4x5 matrix transposition cipher, we first write the message row by row:\n\nH E L L O\nW O R L D\n\nNow, we read the message column by column:\n\nH W\nE O\nL R\nL L\nO D\n\nThe ciphertext produced by this encryption method is \"HWELOLRLOD\"."
