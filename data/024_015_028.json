    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative of the given differential form $\\omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi$, we first need to recall the definition of the exterior derivative. For a p-form $\\alpha = f d\\theta^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge d\\theta^p$, the exterior derivative is given by $d\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta^i} d\\theta^i)\\wedge d\\theta^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge d\\theta^p$.\n\nIn our case, $\\omega$ is a 2-form, and we have $f = \\sin\\theta$. So we need to compute the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. We have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = \\cos\\theta$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivative of $\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} d\\theta + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} d\\phi\\right)\\wedge (\\sin\\theta d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi)$\n\nSince $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$, we only need to consider the first term:\n\n$d\\omega = (\\cos\\theta d\\theta)\\wedge (\\sin\\theta d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi)$\n\nHowever, since $d\\theta\\wedge d\\theta = 0$, we find that the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n\n$d\\omega = 0$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the given differential form $\\omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi$ on $S^2$ is 0."
