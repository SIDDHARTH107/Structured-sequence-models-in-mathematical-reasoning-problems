    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we need to find the angle opposite the shortest side, which is 7 cm. We will use the Law of Cosines to find this angle. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c. In our case, a = 12 cm, b = 14 cm, and c = 7 cm. We want to find the angle C.\n\n7² = 12² + 14² - 2(12)(14) * cos(C)\n\n49 = 144 + 196 - 336 * cos(C)\n\n49 = 340 - 336 * cos(C)\n\n-291 = -336 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 291/336\n\nNow, we will use the inverse cosine function to find the angle C:\n\nC = arccos(291/336)\n\nC ≈ 25.2°\n\nThe measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 25.2°."
