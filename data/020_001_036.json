    "message_1": "A farmer can plant up to 200 acres of land with corn and soybeans. It costs the farmer $100 per acre to plant corn and $80 per acre to plant soybeans. The farmer can sell corn for $300 per acre and soybeans for $200 per acre. The farmer has a maximum budget of $25,000 for planting. What is the optimal combination of corn and soybeans the farmer should plant to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn and y be the number of acres of soybeans.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (total acres constraint)\n2. 100x + 80y ≤ 25,000 (budget constraint)\n\nThe profit function is given by:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = (300x + 200y) - (100x + 80y) = 200x + 120y\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal combination of x and y that satisfies the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's solve the budget constraint for y:\n\n80y ≤ 25,000 - 100x\ny ≤ (25,000 - 100x) / 80\n\nNow, we can use the total acres constraint to find the possible combinations of x and y:\n\nIf x = 0, y ≤ 200\ny = (25,000 - 100(0)) / 80 = 312.5 (which is greater than 200, so y = 200)\n\nIf y = 0, x ≤ 200\nx = (25,000 - 80(0)) / 100 = 250 (which is greater than 200, so x = 200)\n\nNow, we need to find the combination of x and y that maximizes the profit function:\n\n200x + 120y = 200(200) + 120(0) = 40,000 (if x = 200, y = 0)\n200x + 120y = 200(0) + 120(200) = 24,000 (if x = 0, y = 200)\n\nSince 40,000 > 24,000, the optimal combination is to plant 200 acres of corn and 0 acres of soybeans to maximize the profit."
