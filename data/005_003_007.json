Using regression analysis, find the equation of the line that best fits the data, and use it to estimate the test score that a student who studied for 6 hours would obtain.",
    "message_2": "To perform a regression analysis and find the equation of the line that best fits the data, we need the actual data points for the number of hours studied and the corresponding test scores for the 10 students. Please provide the data points so that we can proceed with the analysis."
