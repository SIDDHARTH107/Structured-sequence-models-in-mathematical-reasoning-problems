Suppose we have a loop $\\alpha:[0,1]\\rightarrow P$ with $\\alpha(0)=\\alpha(1)=p$, given by $\\alpha(t)=(\\cos 2\\pi t,\\sin 2\\pi t)$. Let $p:P\\rightarrow P/\\sim$ be the projection map from $P$ onto the quotient space $P/\\sim$, where $\\sim$ is the equivalence relation generated by identifying $(x,1)$ and $(x,-1)$ for all $x\\neq 0$. Find the fundamental group $\\pi_1(P/\\sim, p([1,0]))$, where $p([1,0])$ is the image of the unit interval under $p$.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group $\\pi_1(P/\\sim, p([1,0]))$, we first note that the quotient space $P/\\sim$ can be thought of as the punctured plane with the top and bottom edges of the strip $S = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x \\neq 0, -1 \\leq y \\leq 1\\}$ identified. This is because the equivalence relation identifies points with the same $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinates of $1$ and $-1$.\n\nNow, consider the map $F: P/\\sim \\to S^1$, where $S^1$ is the unit circle, defined by $F([x,y]) = (\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}, \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}})$. This map is continuous and surjective, and it sends the base point $p([1,0])$ to $(1,0)$. Moreover, $F$ maps the loop $\\alpha$ to a loop in $S^1$ that goes around the circle once.\n\nWe claim that $F$ induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups $\\pi_1(P/\\sim, p([1,0]))$ and $\\pi_1(S^1, (1,0))$. To see this, let $\\beta$ be a loop in $P/\\sim$ based at $p([1,0])$. Then, $F \\circ \\beta$ is a loop in $S^1$ based at $(1,0)$. Since $F$ is surjective, for any loop $\\gamma$ in $S^1$ based at $(1,0)$, there exists a loop $\\delta$ in $P/\\sim$ based at $p([1,0])$ such that $F \\circ \\delta = \\gamma$. Thus, $F$ induces a bijection between the homotopy classes of loops in $P/\\sim$ and $S^1$.\n\nFurthermore, $F$ preserves the group operation, i.e., $F([\\beta_1] * [\\beta_2]) = F([\\beta_1]) * F([\\beta_2])$ for any loops $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ in $P/\\sim$. This is because the concatenation of loops in $P/\\sim$ corresponds to the concatenation of their images under $F$ in $S^1$. Therefore, $F$ induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups $\\pi_1(P/\\sim, p([1,0]))$ and $\\pi_1(S^1, (1,0))$.\n\nSince the fundamental group of the circle is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $\\pi_1(P/\\sim, p([1,0])) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1, (1,0)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
