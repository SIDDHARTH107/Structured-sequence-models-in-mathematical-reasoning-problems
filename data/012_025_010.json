    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. To find all the Hamiltonian cycles in the graph G, we can list all the possible cycles and check if they satisfy the Hamiltonian cycle conditions.\n\n1. Start with vertex 1:\n   1-2-4-5-6-3-1\n   1-2-4-6-5-3-1\n   1-2-6-4-5-3-1\n   1-3-5-6-4-2-1\n   1-3-5-4-6-2-1\n   1-3-6-5-4-2-1\n\n2. Start with vertex 2:\n   2-1-3-5-6-4-2\n   2-1-3-6-5-4-2\n   2-1-6-3-5-4-2\n   2-4-5-6-3-1-2\n   2-4-5-3-6-1-2\n   2-4-6-5-3-1-2\n\n3. Start with vertex 3:\n   3-1-2-4-5-6-3\n   3-1-2-6-5-4-3\n   3-1-6-2-4-5-3\n   3-5-6-4-2-1-3\n   3-5-4-6-2-1-3\n   3-6-5-4-2-1-3\n\n4. Start with vertex 4:\n   4-2-1-3-5-6-4\n   4-2-1-6-5-3-4\n   4-2-6-1-3-5-4\n   4-5-6-3-1-2-4\n   4-5-3-6-1-2-4\n   4-6-5-3-1-2-4\n\n5. Start with vertex 5:\n   5-6-4-2-1-3-5\n   5-6-3-1-2-4-5\n   5-3-6-1-2-4-5\n   5-4-6-2-1-3-5\n   5-4-2-1-3-6-5\n\n6. Start with vertex 6:\n   6-5-4-2-1-3-6\n   6-5-3-1-2-4-6\n   6-4-5-3-1-2-6\n   6-4-2-1-3-5-6\n   6-3-5-4-2-1-6\n\nNow, we can see that each Hamiltonian cycle is listed twice (once starting with one vertex and once starting with the opposite vertex). So, we can eliminate the duplicates and obtain the following unique Hamiltonian cycles:\n\n1. 1-2-4-5-6-3-1\n2. 1-2-4-6-5-3-1\n3. 1-2-6-4-5-3-1\n4. 1-3-5-6-4-2-1\n5. 1-3-5-4-6-2-1\n6. 1-3-6-5-4-2-1\n\nThere are 6 unique Hamiltonian cycles in the graph G."
