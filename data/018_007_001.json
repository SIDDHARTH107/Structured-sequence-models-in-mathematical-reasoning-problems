    "message_2": "Given that A is a set with 3 elements, the size of A is simply 3. Now, we need to find the size of its power set.\n\nThe power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself. For a set with n elements, the size of its power set is 2^n.\n\nIn this case, since A has 3 elements, the size of its power set P(A) is 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow, we need to prove that the size of the power set is greater than the size of the set itself. We can do this by comparing their sizes:\n\nSize of A = 3\nSize of P(A) = 8\n\nSince 8 > 3, the size of the power set P(A) is greater than the size of the set A itself. This can be generalized for any set with n elements, as the size of its power set will always be 2^n, which is always greater than n for any positive integer n."
