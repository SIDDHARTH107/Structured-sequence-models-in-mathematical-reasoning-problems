    "message_2": "To find the volume of the sphere inscribed in a cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere, which is equal to the edge length of the cube. In this case, the edge length of the cube is 6 cm, so the diameter of the sphere is also 6 cm.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius is 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nPlugging in the radius of 3 cm, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3)³\nV = (4/3)π(27)\nV = (4)(3.14159)(27/3)\nV = (4)(3.14159)(9)\nV ≈ 113.097 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 113.097 cubic centimeters."
