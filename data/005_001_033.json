    "message_1": "A car manufacturing company claims that its latest model has a fuel efficiency of 15 kilometers per liter on average. To test this claim, a random sample of 50 cars was taken and their fuel efficiency was measured. The sample mean was found to be 14.2 kilometers per liter with a standard deviation of 2.3 kilometers per liter. Test the company's claim by setting up a hypothesis test with a 5% level of significance. Does the sample provide enough evidence to reject the company's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a hypothesis test using the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 15 km/l (The average fuel efficiency is 15 km/l)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 15 km/l (The average fuel efficiency is not 15 km/l)\n\nWe will use a two-tailed t-test since we are testing for a difference in the mean fuel efficiency. The level of significance is α = 0.05.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √sample size)\n\nt = (14.2 - 15) / (2.3 / √50)\nt = (-0.8) / (2.3 / 7.071)\nt = -0.8 / 0.325\nt ≈ -2.462\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with 49 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1) and a 5% level of significance. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.009.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-2.462) is less than the critical t-value (-2.009), we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is enough evidence to reject the company's claim that the average fuel efficiency is 15 km/l at a 5% level of significance."
