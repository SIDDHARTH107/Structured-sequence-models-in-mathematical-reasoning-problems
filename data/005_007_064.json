    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the ages of fathers and their sons, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²]\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of x (father's age) and y (son's age):\n\nx̄ = (36 + 48 + 27 + 42 + 31) / 5 = 184 / 5 = 36.8\nȳ = (12 + 16 + 9 + 14 + 10) / 5 = 61 / 5 = 12.2\n\nNext, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator:\nΣ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] = (36 - 36.8)(12 - 12.2) + (48 - 36.8)(16 - 12.2) + (27 - 36.8)(9 - 12.2) + (42 - 36.8)(14 - 12.2) + (31 - 36.8)(10 - 12.2)\n= (-0.8)(-0.2) + (11.2)(3.8) + (-9.8)(-3.2) + (5.2)(1.8) + (-5.8)(-2.2)\n= 0.16 + 42.56 + 31.36 + 9.36 + 12.76\n= 96.2\n\nDenominator:\nΣ(x - x̄)² = (-0.8)² + (11.2)² + (-9.8)² + (5.2)² + (-5.8)²\n= 0.64 + 125.44 + 96.04 + 27.04 + 33.64\n= 282.8\n\nΣ(y - ȳ)² = (-0.2)² + (3.8)² + (-3.2)² + (1.8)² + (-2.2)²\n= 0.04 + 14.44 + 10.24 + 3.24 + 4.84\n= 32.8\n\n√[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²] = √(282.8 * 32.8) = √9273.44 = 96.29\n\nNow, we can calculate the correlation coefficient:\n\nr = 96.2 / 96.29 = 0.999\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the correlation coefficient between the ages of fathers and their sons is 1.00."
