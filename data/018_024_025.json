    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference (A △ B) is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {5, 7, 11, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A, denoted as Ac. The complement of A is the set of all elements that are not in A. Since we are not given a universal set, we cannot find the exact elements in Ac. However, we can still analyze the given expressions.\n\nLet's find (A △ B) ∩ Ac. This is the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with the complement of A. Since the elements in the symmetric difference are either in A or B but not both, the elements from A in the symmetric difference will not be in Ac. Therefore, (A △ B) ∩ Ac will only contain the elements from B that are not in A.\n\n(A △ B) ∩ Ac = {6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∩ Ac) △ (B ∩ Ac). The intersection of A and Ac is an empty set, as there are no elements that are both in A and not in A.\n\nA ∩ Ac = {}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B and Ac. This will be the set of elements that are in B and not in A.\n\nB ∩ Ac = {6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the empty set and the intersection of B and Ac.\n\n{} △ {6, 8, 10} = {6, 8, 10}\n\nComparing the two expressions, we have:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ Ac = {6, 8, 10}\n(A ∩ Ac) △ (B ∩ Ac) = {6, 8, 10}\n\nContrary to the initial claim, the two expressions are equal."
