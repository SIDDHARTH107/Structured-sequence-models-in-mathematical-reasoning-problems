Both companies must set a price and the customers will purchase from the company with the lower price. If both companies set the same price, they will split the market share 50-50. \n\na) If company A sets a price of $60, what price should company B set to maximize its profit?\nb) If company A sets a price of $75 and company B sets a price of $65, what is the market share for each company and what are their respective profits?",
    "message_2": "a) If company A sets a price of $60, company B should set a price slightly lower than $60 to capture the entire market share. Since the cost of production is $50, company B can set a price of $59.99 to maximize its profit. This way, company B will sell its product at a profit of $9.99 per unit and attract all the customers.\n\nb) If company A sets a price of $75 and company B sets a price of $65, company B will have a lower price and therefore capture the entire market share. In this case, the market share for company A is 0% and for company B is 100%.\n\nTo calculate the respective profits, we need to know the number of units sold. Let's assume that both companies produce and sell Q units of the product.\n\nFor company A:\nMarket share: 0%\nProfit per unit: $75 - $50 = $25\nTotal profit: 0% * Q * $25 = $0\n\nFor company B:\nMarket share: 100%\nProfit per unit: $65 - $50 = $15\nTotal profit: 100% * Q * $15 = $15Q\n\nSo, company A has a profit of $0, and company B has a profit of $15Q, where Q is the number of units sold."
