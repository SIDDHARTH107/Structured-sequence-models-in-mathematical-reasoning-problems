    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3} - {1} = {2, 3}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and {4}, denoted as (A △ B) △ {4}:\n\n(A △ B) △ {4} = ({2, 3} ∪ {4}) - ({2, 3} ∩ {4}) = {2, 3, 4} - {} = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and {4}, denoted as B △ {4}:\n\nB △ {4} = ({1, 2} ∪ {4}) - ({1, 2} ∩ {4}) = {1, 2, 4} - {} = {1, 2, 4}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B △ {4}), denoted as A △ (B △ {4}):\n\nA △ (B △ {4}) = ({1, 3} ∪ {1, 2, 4}) - ({1, 3} ∩ {1, 2, 4}) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1} = {2, 3, 4}\n\nComparing the two results, we have:\n\n(A △ B) △ {4} = {2, 3, 4}\nA △ (B △ {4}) = {2, 3, 4}\n\nIn this case, the two values are equal. However, the original question mentioned the Cartesian product, which was not used in the calculations. The symmetric difference operation is not directly related to the Cartesian product, and the question seems to be mixing the two concepts. The symmetric difference operation is indeed associative, as shown in this example, but this does not prove anything about the Cartesian product."
