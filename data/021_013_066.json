    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces 3 types of goods A, B, and C. The profit per unit for each type of goods are 10, 20, and 25 dollars respectively. The factory has a production capacity of at most 150 units per day. Type A requires 3 hours for production, type B requires 4 hours, and type C requires 5 hours. If the factory operates for a maximum of 8 hours per day, how many units of each type should the factory produce to maximize profit? Use simulated annealing method to solve this optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function.\n2. Define the constraints.\n3. Set initial temperature and cooling rate.\n4. Generate random initial solution.\n5. Perform the simulated annealing algorithm.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 10A + 20B + 25C\n\nConstraints:\n- A + B + C <= 150 (production capacity constraint)\n- 3A + 4B + 5C <= 8 * 60 (time constraint, 8 hours per day)\n- A, B, C >= 0 (non-negative production units)\n\nInitial temperature (T) and cooling rate (alpha) are hyperparameters that can be tuned. For this example, let's set T = 1000 and alpha = 0.99.\n\nNow, let's implement the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Generate a random initial solution (A, B, C) that satisfies the constraints.\n2. Calculate the objective function value (profit) for the initial solution.\n3. Set the current solution as the best solution found so far.\n4. Repeat until the temperature is low enough or a maximum number of iterations is reached:\n   a. Generate a random neighbor solution (A', B', C') by slightly modifying the current solution.\n   b. Calculate the objective function value (profit) for the neighbor solution.\n   c. If the neighbor solution is better than the current solution, set it as the new current solution.\n   d. If the neighbor solution is worse than the current solution, accept it as the new current solution with a probability that depends on the temperature and the difference in objective function values.\n   e. If the current solution is better than the best solution found so far, update the best solution.\n   f. Decrease the temperature by multiplying it with the cooling rate (T = T * alpha).\n\nAfter the algorithm is finished, the best solution found will be the optimal production units for each type of goods to maximize profit.\n\nNote that the simulated annealing method is a heuristic approach and may not always find the global optimum. However, it is a useful method for solving complex optimization problems with large search spaces and multiple constraints."
