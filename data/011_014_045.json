    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible number of cycles in a simple graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we can use the concept of complete graphs. A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n\nA complete graph with n vertices, denoted as K_n, has n * (n - 1) / 2 edges. In our case, we have 6 vertices, so the complete graph K_6 has 6 * (6 - 1) / 2 = 15 edges. However, we only have 9 edges in our graph, so we need to remove 6 edges from K_6 to get our graph.\n\nWhen we remove an edge from a complete graph, we reduce the number of cycles that include the two vertices connected by that edge. In the worst case, removing an edge would break all cycles that include those two vertices. To maximize the number of cycles in our graph, we should try to minimize the number of cycles we break when removing edges.\n\nTo do this, we can remove edges in a way that creates a \"star\" configuration, where one vertex is connected to all other vertices, and there are no other connections between the other vertices. In this configuration, the central vertex is part of all cycles, and removing an edge only breaks one cycle.\n\nWe can create a star configuration by removing 5 edges from K_6, leaving us with 10 edges. We still need to remove one more edge to get our graph with 9 edges. Removing any edge from the star configuration will break one more cycle.\n\nIn the star configuration, there are 5 cycles of length 3 (triangles) and 10 cycles of length 4 (quadrilaterals). When we remove one more edge, we break one of the quadrilaterals, leaving us with 5 triangles and 9 quadrilaterals.\n\nSo, the maximum possible number of cycles in a simple graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges is 5 + 9 = 14 cycles."
