    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first set up a system of linear congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nNext, we find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nNow, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N/3 = 105/3 = 35\nN2 = N/5 = 105/5 = 21\nN3 = N/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNext, we find the modular inverses of the partial products:\n\n35 * a1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => a1 ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n21 * a2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => a2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n15 * a3 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => a3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can find the solution to the system of linear congruences:\n\nx = (2 * 35 * 2) + (3 * 21 * 1) + (2 * 15 * 1) = 140 + 63 + 30 = 233\n\nFinally, we find the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions by taking the remainder of x when divided by N:\n\nx ≡ 233 (mod 105)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions is 233."
