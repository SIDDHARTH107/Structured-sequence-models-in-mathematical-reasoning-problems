    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we can use the fact that 32 = 2^5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 32 must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. In this case, the possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. However, since there must be at least one Sylow 2-subgroup, we can eliminate the possibility of 32. \n\nNow, we can use the classification of finite abelian groups. A group of order 32 is abelian if and only if it has a single Sylow 2-subgroup. The abelian groups of order 32 are:\n\n1. Z_32 (cyclic group of order 32)\n2. Z_16 x Z_2\n3. Z_8 x Z_4\n4. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2\n5. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2\n6. Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n7. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n\nThere are 7 abelian groups of order 32.\n\nFor non-abelian groups, we can use the fact that a group of order 32 has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. The non-abelian groups of order 32 are:\n\n1. The dihedral group D_32\n2. The quaternion group Q_32\n3. The semidirect product of Z_16 and Z_2\n4. The semidirect product of Z_8 x Z_4 and Z_2\n5. The semidirect product of Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2 and Z_2\n\nThere are 5 non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nIn total, there are 7 abelian groups + 5 non-abelian groups = 12 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
