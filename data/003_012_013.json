    "message_1": "A person standing at the ground level looks up at the top of a building and measures the angle of elevation to be 60 degrees. If the person moves 20 meters closer to the building, the angle of elevation becomes 75 degrees. How tall is the building?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the building as h meters, and the initial distance from the person to the building as x meters. When the person moves 20 meters closer, the new distance is (x - 20) meters.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation, the height of the building, and the distance from the person to the building. We have two equations:\n\n1) tan(60°) = h / x\n2) tan(75°) = h / (x - 20)\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of tan(60°) and tan(75°):\n\ntan(60°) = √3\ntan(75°) ≈ 3.732\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equations as:\n\n1) h = x * √3\n2) h = (x - 20) * 3.732\n\nSince both expressions are equal to h, we can set them equal to each other:\n\nx * √3 = (x - 20) * 3.732\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx * √3 = 3.732x - 74.64\nx * √3 - 3.732x = -74.64\nx(√3 - 3.732) = -74.64\nx ≈ 46.97\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the height of the building using either equation. We'll use the first equation:\n\nh = x * √3\nh = 46.97 * √3\nh ≈ 81.32\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 81.32 meters."
