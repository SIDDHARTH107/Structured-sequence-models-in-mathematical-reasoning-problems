The survey results show that the correlation coefficient between attendance and grades is 0.7. The average attendance rate of the class is 85%. If a student attends 90% of the classes, what is their predicted grade based on the regression equation that the teacher developed?\n \nAnswer: \nWe can use the regression equation to predict the grade of a student who attends 90% of the classes, given that the correlation coefficient is 0.7. Let's assume that the regression equation is y = mx + b, where y represents the predicted grade, x represents the attendance rate, m represents the slope, and b represents the y-intercept.\n \nTo find m, we can use the formula:\nm = r * (sy / sx)\nwhere r is the correlation coefficient, sy is the standard deviation of the grades, and sx is the standard deviation of the attendance rates. Let's assume that sy = 10 and sx = 5 (these are just hypothetical values).\n \nm = 0.7 * (10 / 5) = 1.4\n \nTo find b, we can use the formula:\nb = y - mx\nwhere y is the mean grade, x is the mean attendance rate, and m is the slope.\n \nAssuming that the mean grade is 80%, the mean attendance rate is 85%, and m is 1.4, we get:\n \nb = 80 - 1.4*85 = -42\n \nTherefore, the regression equation is:\ny = 1.4x - 42\n \nIf a student attends 90% of the classes, their predicted grade is:\ny = 1.4*90 - 42 = 72%\n \nSo, based on the regression equation, a student who attends 90% of the classes is predicted to get a grade of 72%. However, please note that this prediction is based solely on the correlation between attendance and grades, and other factors could also influence a student's grade, including their level of engagement in class, their study habits, etc.",
