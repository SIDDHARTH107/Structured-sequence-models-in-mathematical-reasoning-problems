    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of B and {2,3}. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nB ∩ {2,3} = {2,3}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of A and the intersection we just found, which is A x (B ∩ {2,3}) = A x {2,3}. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nA x {2,3} = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of A x (B ∩ {2,3}) is {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}."
