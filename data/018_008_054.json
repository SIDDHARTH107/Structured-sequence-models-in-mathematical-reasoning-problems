    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of A×B, we form ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. The Cartesian product A×B is:\n\nA×B = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of B×A by forming ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A. The Cartesian product B×A is:\n\nB×A = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\nTo show that A×B and B×A are not equal, we can compare their elements. If there is at least one element in A×B that is not in B×A, or vice versa, then the two sets are not equal.\n\nComparing the elements, we can see that (1,4) is in A×B but not in B×A, and (4,1) is in B×A but not in A×B. Therefore, the two sets A×B and B×A are not equal."
