    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the response curve for a forced van der Pol oscillator, we need to use the following formula:\n\nAmplitude (A) = F0 / sqrt((k - mω^2)^2 + (bω)^2)\n\nwhere:\nF0 = driving force amplitude\nk = spring constant\nm = mass\nω = angular frequency (2πf, where f is the frequency in Hz)\nb = damping constant\n\nHowever, we are not given the values for the spring constant (k) and mass (m) in the problem. Therefore, we cannot calculate the amplitude of the response curve without this information. Please provide the values for k and m to proceed with the calculation."
