    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 3x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -4, and c = -4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(3)(-4))) / 2(3)\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 48)) / 6\n\nx = (4 ± √64) / 6\n\nx = (4 ± 8) / 6\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 8) / 6 = 12 / 6 = 2\n\nx = (4 - 8) / 6 = -4 / 6 = -2/3\n\nSo, the solutions for the quadratic equation 3x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0 are x = 2 and x = -2/3."
