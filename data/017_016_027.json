    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since the order of G is a power of a prime number (3^3), G is a p-group. According to the class equation, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G : C_G(x)]\n\nwhere Z(G) is the center of G, C_G(x) is the centralizer of x in G, and the sum runs over a set of representatives of the conjugacy classes of G not contained in the center.\n\nSince G is a p-group, the center Z(G) is nontrivial, i.e., |Z(G)| ≥ 3. If |Z(G)| = 27, then G is abelian and isomorphic to C27. So, let's assume |Z(G)| = 3.\n\nNow, let x be an element of order 3 in G. Since there is only one such element, x must be in the center of G, i.e., x ∈ Z(G). Thus, all other elements of G not in Z(G) have order 9 or 27.\n\nLet y be an element of G not in Z(G). Then, the order of y is either 9 or 27. Since G is a p-group, the order of the centralizer C_G(y) must be a power of 3. Moreover, since y is not in the center, C_G(y) is a proper subgroup of G, so |C_G(y)| is either 3 or 9.\n\nIf |C_G(y)| = 3, then [G : C_G(y)] = 27 / 3 = 9, which is a contradiction because the class equation implies that the sum of the indices must be divisible by 3. Therefore, |C_G(y)| = 9, and [G : C_G(y)] = 27 / 9 = 3.\n\nNow, the class equation becomes:\n\n27 = 3 + 3 * (number of conjugacy classes not in Z(G))\n\nSince the number of conjugacy classes must be a positive integer, the only possibility is that there is only one conjugacy class not in Z(G). This means that all elements of G not in Z(G) are conjugate to y. Since conjugate elements have the same order, all elements of G not in Z(G) have the same order as y.\n\nIf the order of y is 9, then G has one element of order 3 (x) and 24 elements of order 9. In this case, G is isomorphic to C3 × C9, which is not cyclic.\n\nIf the order of y is 27, then all elements of G not in Z(G) have order 27. Since G has 27 elements, and Z(G) has 3 elements, there are 24 elements of order 27 in G. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 27, and G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nThus, we have shown that if the number of elements of order 3 in G is 1, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27."
