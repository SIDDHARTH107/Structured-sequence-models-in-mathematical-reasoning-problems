    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher message, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair square using the key \"MONARCHY\". The square will look like this:\n\nM O N A R\nC H Y B D\nE F G I K\nL P Q S T\nU V W X Z\n\nNow, we need to decrypt the text \"QYXSZ\" using the Playfair square. The text is divided into digraphs: QY and XS. For each digraph, we follow these rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the letter to its left (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the letter above it (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters are in different rows and columns, replace each letter with the letter in its row that is in the same column as the other letter.\n\nDecrypting the digraphs:\n\nQY: Q is in the same column as X, and Y is in the same row as S. So, the decrypted digraph is XS.\nXS: X is in the same column as S, and S is in the same row as Q. So, the decrypted digraph is SQ.\n\nThe decrypted message is \"XSSQ\"."
