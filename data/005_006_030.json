A random sample of 36 apples is selected from the box. What is the probability that the total weight of the 36 apples will be less than 3600 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the total weight of the 36 apples will be less than 3600 grams, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we have a sample size of 36 apples. The mean weight of the apples is 100 grams, and the standard deviation is 10 grams. We want to find the probability that the total weight of the 36 apples is less than 3600 grams, which is equivalent to finding the probability that the average weight of the 36 apples is less than 3600/36 = 100 grams.\n\nSince we have a large enough sample size (n = 36), we can assume that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normally distributed. The mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the population mean (μ = 100 grams), and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (σ/√n = 10/√36 = 10/6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.67 grams).\n\nNow, we can standardize the value we want to find the probability for (100 grams) using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / (σ/√n)\nz = (100 - 100) / 1.67 ≈ 0\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being less than 0 is 0.5, or 50%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the total weight of the 36 apples will be less than 3600 grams is approximately 50%."
