    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix, which we'll call D. The coefficient matrix is:\n\n| 2 -3 |\n| 4  5 |\n\nD = (2 * 5) - (-3 * 4) = 10 + 12 = 22\n\nNow, we'll find the determinant of the matrix Dx, where we replace the first column of the coefficient matrix with the constants from the right side of the equations:\n\n| 4 -3 |\n| -2 5 |\n\nDx = (4 * 5) - (-3 * -2) = 20 - 6 = 14\n\nNext, we'll find the determinant of the matrix Dy, where we replace the second column of the coefficient matrix with the constants from the right side of the equations:\n\n| 2  4 |\n| 4 -2 |\n\nDy = (2 * -2) - (4 * 4) = -4 - 16 = -20\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = Dx / D = 14 / 22 = 7 / 11\ny = Dy / D = -20 / 22 = -10 / 11\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 7/11 and y = -10/11."
