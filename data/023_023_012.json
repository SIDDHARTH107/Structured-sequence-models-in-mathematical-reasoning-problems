    "message_2": "To analyze the behavior of the network for frequencies up to 30 Hz, we can use the Fourier transform to convert the input signal f(t) from the time domain to the frequency domain. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nSince f(t) is composed of three sinusoidal functions, we can find the Fourier transform of each component separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Fourier transform of 3cos(5t):\n\nThe Fourier transform of cos(ω₀t) is (π/2)[δ(ω - ω₀) + δ(ω + ω₀)], where δ is the Dirac delta function and ω₀ is the angular frequency of the cosine function.\n\nFor 3cos(5t), ω₀ = 5, so the Fourier transform is (3π/2)[δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)].\n\n2. Fourier transform of 2sin(10t):\n\nThe Fourier transform of sin(ω₀t) is (-jπ/2)[δ(ω - ω₀) - δ(ω + ω₀)].\n\nFor 2sin(10t), ω₀ = 10, so the Fourier transform is (-j2π/2)[δ(ω - 10) - δ(ω + 10)].\n\n3. Fourier transform of 4cos(15t):\n\nFor 4cos(15t), ω₀ = 15, so the Fourier transform is (4π/2)[δ(ω - 15) + δ(ω + 15)].\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier transforms of the three components:\n\nF(ω) = (3π/2)[δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)] - j(π)[δ(ω - 10) - δ(ω + 10)] + (2π)[δ(ω - 15) + δ(ω + 15)]\n\nThe behavior of the network for frequencies up to 30 Hz can be determined by analyzing the magnitude and phase of the Fourier transform F(ω) at different frequencies. The input signal has three main frequency components at 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz. The network will respond differently to each of these frequencies depending on its transfer function. \n\nIn summary, the Fourier transform of the input signal f(t) is:\n\nF(ω) = (3π/2)[δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)] - j(π)[δ(ω - 10) - δ(ω + 10)] + (2π)[δ(ω - 15) + δ(ω + 15)]\n\nThis representation allows us to analyze the behavior of the network for frequencies up to 30 Hz by examining the magnitude and phase of F(ω) at the different frequency components (5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz)."
