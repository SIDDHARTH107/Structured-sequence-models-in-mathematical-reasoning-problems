    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 10, we first need to find the second derivative of the function and then solve for x when the second derivative is equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 10)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (6x^2 - 18x + 12)\nf''(x) = 12x - 18\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to solve for x when f''(x) = 0:\n12x - 18 = 0\n\nAdd 18 to both sides:\n12x = 18\n\nDivide by 12:\nx = 1.5\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 1.5. To find the corresponding y-value, plug x back into the original function:\n\nf(1.5) = 2(1.5)^3 - 9(1.5)^2 + 12(1.5) + 10\nf(1.5) = 2(3.375) - 9(2.25) + 18 + 10\nf(1.5) = 6.75 - 20.25 + 18 + 10\nf(1.5) = 14.5\n\nSo, the inflection point is at (1.5, 14.5)."
