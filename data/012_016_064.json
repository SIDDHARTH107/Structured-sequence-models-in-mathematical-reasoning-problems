    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a simple connected graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges, we first need to identify the graph. Since the graph has 5 vertices and is connected, it must be a tree if it has 4 edges. However, our graph has 7 edges, which means it has 3 more edges than a tree. This implies that the graph has 3 cycles.\n\nA simple connected graph with 5 vertices and 3 cycles is K5, the complete graph on 5 vertices. K5 has 10 edges, but our graph has only 7 edges. Therefore, we need to remove 3 edges from K5 to obtain our graph. Removing 3 edges from K5 will result in a graph with 5 vertices, 7 edges, and 2 cycles.\n\nNow, let's find the Tutte polynomial of this graph. The Tutte polynomial T(x, y) of a graph G is defined as:\n\nT(x, y) = T(G-e)(x, y) + T(G*e)(x, y) if e is not a bridge,\nT(x, y) = x * T(G/e)(x, y) if e is a bridge,\n\nwhere G-e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, G*e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by collapsing the edge e.\n\nFor our graph, let's denote it as G. We can choose an edge e that is part of one of the two cycles. Then, G-e will have 5 vertices, 6 edges, and 1 cycle, while G*e will have 4 vertices, 5 edges, and 1 cycle.\n\nNow, let's compute the Tutte polynomial for G-e and G*e:\n\n1. For G-e, we can choose an edge f that is part of the remaining cycle. Then, (G-e)-f will have 5 vertices, 5 edges, and no cycles (i.e., it's a tree), while (G-e)*f will have 4 vertices, 4 edges, and no cycles (i.e., it's also a tree). The Tutte polynomial of a tree with n vertices is given by T(x, y) = x^(n-1). Therefore, T((G-e)-f)(x, y) = x^4 and T((G-e)*f)(x, y) = x^3. Thus, T(G-e)(x, y) = x^4 + x^3.\n\n2. For G*e, we can choose an edge g that is part of the remaining cycle. Then, (G*e)-g will have 4 vertices, 4 edges, and no cycles (i.e., it's a tree), while (G*e)*g will have 3 vertices, 3 edges, and no cycles (i.e., it's also a tree). Therefore, T((G*e)-g)(x, y) = x^3 and T((G*e)*g)(x, y) = x^2. Thus, T(G*e)(x, y) = x^3 + x^2.\n\nFinally, the Tutte polynomial of G is given by T(G)(x, y) = T(G-e)(x, y) + T(G*e)(x, y) = (x^4 + x^3) + (x^3 + x^2) = x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2."
