    "message_1": "According to a recent survey, there is a 20% chance that a customer who purchases a mobile phone also buys a phone case at the same time. Suppose a retailer sells 100 mobile phones, what is the probability that at least 20 customers will buy a phone case with their mobile phone?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 20 customers will buy a phone case with their mobile phone, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, customers buying a phone case)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 mobile phones sold)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 20 customers buying a phone case)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 20% or 0.2)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, 80% or 0.8)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 20 customers buying a phone case, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities from k = 20 to k = 100:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 20 to 100\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20)\n\nSo, we need to find the probability of fewer than 20 customers buying a phone case:\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities:\n\nP(X < 20) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)\n\nAfter calculating the sum of probabilities, we can find the probability of at least 20 customers buying a phone case:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20)\n\nUsing a calculator or statistical software to compute the sum of probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.0179\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least 20 customers buying a phone case is:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - 0.0179 ≈ 0.9821\n\nSo, there is approximately a 98.21% chance that at least 20 customers will buy a phone case with their mobile phone."
