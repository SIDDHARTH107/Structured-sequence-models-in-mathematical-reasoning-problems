    "message_2": "To find the number of cycles of length 4 in a graph G with 8 vertices and 11 edges, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the concept of degrees in a graph.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, since we have 8 vertices and 11 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 11 = 22.\n\nLet's denote the degree of each vertex as d1, d2, ..., d8. Then, we have:\n\nd1 + d2 + ... + d8 = 22\n\nNow, let's consider the number of 4-cycles in G. A 4-cycle is a cycle with 4 vertices, and each vertex in the cycle has a degree of at least 2. Let's denote the number of 4-cycles as C4.\n\nTo count the number of 4-cycles, we can use the following formula:\n\nC4 = (1/8) * (d1(d1 - 1) + d2(d2 - 1) + ... + d8(d8 - 1)) - E\n\nwhere E is the number of edges in G (11 in this case).\n\nThe first term in the formula represents the number of ways to choose two neighbors for each vertex, and the factor of 1/8 accounts for overcounting each 4-cycle 8 times (once for each vertex and direction).\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of the sum of the degrees of the vertices, such that each vertex has a degree of at least 2 (to form a 4-cycle).\n\nThe minimum sum of degrees can be achieved when 6 vertices have a degree of 2, and the remaining 2 vertices have a degree of 3:\n\n2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 18\n\nHowever, this configuration doesn't satisfy the Handshaking Lemma, as the sum of the degrees is less than 22. Therefore, we need to increase the degree of some vertices. The minimum increase that satisfies the Handshaking Lemma is to increase the degree of the two vertices with degree 3 to 4:\n\n2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 22\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of 4-cycles using the formula:\n\nC4 = (1/8) * (2(1) + 2(1) + 2(1) + 2(1) + 2(1) + 2(1) + 4(3) + 4(3)) - 11\nC4 = (1/8) * (12 + 24) - 11\nC4 = (1/8) * 36 - 11\nC4 = 4.5 - 11\n\nSince the number of cycles must be an integer, we can round 4.5 down to 4. Therefore, there are 4 cycles of length 4 in the graph G with 8 vertices and 11 edges."
