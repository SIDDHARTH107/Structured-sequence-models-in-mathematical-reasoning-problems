    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, rolling a \"6\")\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 rolls)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 20 \"6\"s)\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 1/6 for rolling a \"6\")\n\nSince we want to find the probability of getting at least 20 \"6\"s, we need to sum the probabilities for k = 20, 21, ..., 100.\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 20 to 100\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = Σ [C(100, k) * (1/6)^k * (5/6)^(100-k)] for k = 20 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) ≈ 0.0266\n\nSo, the probability of getting a \"6\" at least 20 times in a Monte Carlo simulation with 100 rolls is approximately 2.66%."
