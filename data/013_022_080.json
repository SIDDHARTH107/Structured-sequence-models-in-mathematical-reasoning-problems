    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, player 1 is given an endowment of $10 and must decide how much to give to player 2. If player 2 does not accept the amount given by player 1, then both players receive nothing. If player 2 accepts, then player 1 keeps the remaining amount. Assuming player 2 has a minimum acceptable amount of $2, what is the maximum amount that player 1 should give to player 2 in order to receive any benefit?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, player 1 should give player 2 the minimum acceptable amount of $2. This ensures that player 2 will accept the offer, as it meets their minimum requirement. By giving $2 to player 2, player 1 will keep the remaining $8 ($10 - $2) for themselves, maximizing their benefit."
