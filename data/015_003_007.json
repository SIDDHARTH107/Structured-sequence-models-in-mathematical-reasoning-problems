    "message_2": "The period-doubling constant, also known as the Feigenbaum constant (δ), is a universal constant that appears in bifurcation diagrams of nonlinear maps, such as the logistic map. It is approximately equal to 4.6692016091. However, this constant is not directly related to a specific growth rate parameter (r) in the logistic map.\n\nThe logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the population at time n, and r is the growth rate parameter.\n\nFor r = 3.4, we can analyze the behavior of the logistic map, but the period-doubling constant remains the same (δ ≈ 4.6692016091) regardless of the value of r. The constant is related to the ratio of the intervals between successive bifurcation points in the logistic map, not to a specific growth rate parameter.\n\nIf you are looking for the behavior of the logistic map at r = 3.4, you can iterate the logistic map equation for different initial conditions and observe the long-term behavior of the population."
