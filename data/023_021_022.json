    "message_2": "To find the electric field at a distance of 2 meters from the wire, we will first find the magnetic field using the Biot-Savart law and then use Maxwell's equations to find the electric field.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (5 A), dl is the differential length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire (2 m).\n\nFor an infinite wire along the z-axis, we can integrate the Biot-Savart law over the entire length of the wire. However, since the wire is symmetric along the z-axis, the magnetic field will only have a component in the azimuthal direction (θ direction in cylindrical coordinates). Therefore, we can write the magnetic field as:\n\nB = B_θ * (θ̂)\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field:\n\n∮ B * dl = μ₀ * I_enc\n\nwhere I_enc is the current enclosed by the Amperian loop. For a loop of radius 2 m, the enclosed current is 5 A. The left side of the equation is the line integral of the magnetic field around the loop, which can be written as:\n\nB_θ * 2π * 2 = μ₀ * 5\n\nSolving for B_θ, we get:\n\nB_θ = (μ₀ * 5) / (4π * 2)\n\nNow, we can use Maxwell's equations to find the electric field. Specifically, we will use Faraday's law, which states that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative time derivative of the magnetic field:\n\n∇ × E = -∂B/∂t\n\nSince the magnetic field is static (not changing with time), the right side of the equation is zero. This means that the electric field has no curl, and is therefore conservative. In other words, the electric field can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential:\n\nE = -∇V\n\nTo find the electric field, we can use the Fourier transform method. First, we need to find the potential V(r, θ) in cylindrical coordinates. Since the problem is symmetric in the azimuthal direction, the potential will only depend on the radial distance r:\n\nV(r) = -∫ E(r) dr\n\nSince the electric field is conservative, it will have only a radial component:\n\nE(r) = E_r * (r̂)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation, we get:\n\nF{E(r)} = F{-∇V(r)}\n\nSince the gradient operator in cylindrical coordinates is given by:\n\n∇ = (r̂ * ∂/∂r) + (θ̂ * (1/r) * ∂/∂θ) + (ẑ * ∂/∂z)\n\nand the potential V(r) only depends on r, we can write the Fourier transform of the gradient as:\n\nF{-∇V(r)} = -F{(r̂ * ∂V/∂r)}\n\nNow, we can take the inverse Fourier transform of both sides to find the electric field:\n\nE(r) = -∇V(r)\n\nSince the electric field has only a radial component, we can write:\n\nE_r = -∂V/∂r\n\nHowever, we cannot find an explicit expression for the electric field using the Fourier transform method, as the problem is not well-suited for this approach. Instead, we can use the fact that the electric field is conservative and has no curl to conclude that the electric field must be zero everywhere outside the wire. This is because the magnetic field is constant and not changing with time, so there is no induced electric field.\n\nIn summary, the electric field at a distance of 2 meters from the wire is zero."
