    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of this product with the set C = {(1,5), (2,4), (3,5), (3,4)}.\n\n(A × B) ∩ C = {(1,5), (2,4), (3,5), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's prove that the Cartesian product of A and B is distributive over intersection using this numerical example. To do this, we need to show that:\n\n(A × B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C₁) × (B ∩ C₂)\n\nwhere C₁ = {1, 2, 3} and C₂ = {4, 5} are the projections of the set C onto the sets A and B, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the projections of C onto A and B:\n\nC₁ = {1, 2, 3} (all the first elements of the ordered pairs in C)\nC₂ = {4, 5} (all the second elements of the ordered pairs in C)\n\nNow, let's find the intersections of A and C₁, and B and C₂:\n\nA ∩ C₁ = {1, 2, 3}\nB ∩ C₂ = {4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of these intersections:\n\n(A ∩ C₁) × (B ∩ C₂) = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nComparing this with the intersection of A × B and C:\n\n(A × B) ∩ C = {(1,5), (2,4), (3,5), (3,4)}\n(A ∩ C₁) × (B ∩ C₂) = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nWe can see that the two sets are not equal. Therefore, the Cartesian product of A and B is not distributive over intersection in this numerical example."
