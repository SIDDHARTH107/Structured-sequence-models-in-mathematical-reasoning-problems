The survival times of these participants in days were recorded. The survival time data are as follows: \n\n120, 180, 90, 250, 300, 80, 100, 110, 190, 75, 85, 220, 240, 160, 200, 310, 130, 140, 170, 230, 195, 165, 155, 205, 225, 280, 270, 260, 150, 125, 175, 240, 310, 250, 260, 290, 130, 240, 230, 230, 250, 200, 300, 295, 290, 220, 230, 255, 235, 190, 230\n\nCalculate the median and mean survival times for the participants who received the drug.\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the median and mean survival times, we first need to sort the data in ascending order:\n\n75, 80, 85, 90, 100, 110, 120, 125, 130, 130, 140, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 190, 190, 195, 200, 200, 205, 220, 220, 230, 230, 230, 230, 235, 240, 240, 240, 250, 250, 250, 255, 260, 260, 270, 280, 290, 290, 295, 300, 300, 310, 310\n\nNow, let's find the median survival time. Since there are 50 data points, the median will be the average of the 25th and 26th values:\n\n(220 + 220) / 2 = 440 / 2 = 220\n\nThe median survival time is 220 days.\n\nNext, let's calculate the mean survival time. To do this, we will add up all the survival times and divide by the number of participants (50):\n\n(75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 100 + 110 + 120 + 125 + 130 + 130 + 140 + 150 + 155 + 160 + 165 + 170 + 175 + 180 + 190 + 190 + 195 + 200 + 200 + 205 + 220 + 220 + 230 + 230 + 230 + 230 + 235 + 240 + 240 + 240 + 250 + 250 + 250 + 255 + 260 + 260 + 270 + 280 + 290 + 290 + 295 + 300 + 300 + 310 + 310) / 50\n\nSum of the survival times = 11900\n\nMean survival time = 11900 / 50 = 238\n\nThe mean survival time is 238 days."
