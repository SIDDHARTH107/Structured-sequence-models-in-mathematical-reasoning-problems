    "message_1": "A farmer has 60 acres of land to plant crops. The farmer wants to maximize the profit by planting two crops: corn and wheat. The profits per acre for corn and wheat are $300 and $200, respectively. The farmer has 2000 pounds of fertilizer and 1000 hours of labor available. It takes 5 pounds of fertilizer and 2 hours of labor to produce an acre of corn, and 3 pounds of fertilizer and 1 hour of labor to produce an acre of wheat. How many acres of each crop should the farmer plant to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn and y be the number of acres of wheat. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 300x + 200y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 60 (total acres constraint)\n2. 5x + 3y ≤ 2000 (fertilizer constraint)\n3. 2x + y ≤ 1000 (labor constraint)\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can use the method of linear programming to solve this problem. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ 60 - x\n2. y ≤ (2000 - 5x) / 3\n3. y ≤ 1000 - 2x\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersections of the constraint lines:\n\nVertex 1: Intersection of constraints 1 and 2:\nx + y = 60\n5x + 3y = 2000\nSolving this system, we get x = 40, y = 20.\n\nVertex 2: Intersection of constraints 1 and 3:\nx + y = 60\n2x + y = 1000\nSolving this system, we get x = 20, y = 40.\n\nVertex 3: Intersection of constraints 2 and 3:\n5x + 3y = 2000\n2x + y = 1000\nSolving this system, we get x = 50, y = 10.\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(40, 20) = 300(40) + 200(20) = 12000 + 4000 = $16,000\nP(20, 40) = 300(20) + 200(40) = 6000 + 8000 = $14,000\nP(50, 10) = 300(50) + 200(10) = 15000 + 2000 = $17,000\n\nThe maximum profit of $17,000 is achieved when the farmer plants 50 acres of corn and 10 acres of wheat."
