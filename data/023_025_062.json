    "message_2": "To determine the reflectivity of the film at a wavelength of 500nm, we need to calculate the reflection coefficients at each interface and then use the Fourier transform to find the overall reflectivity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the reflection coefficients (r) at each interface using the Fresnel equations:\n\nr12 = (n1 - n2) / (n1 + n2)\nr23 = (n2 - n3) / (n2 + n3)\n\nwhere n1, n2, and n3 are the refractive indices of the layers.\n\nr12 = (1.5 - 1.2) / (1.5 + 1.2) = 0.3 / 2.7 ≈ 0.1111\nr23 = (1.2 - 1.4) / (1.2 + 1.4) = -0.2 / 2.6 ≈ -0.0769\n\nNext, we need to calculate the phase shift (Φ) for each layer:\n\nΦ = 2πnd/λ\n\nwhere n is the refractive index, d is the thickness, and λ is the wavelength.\n\nΦ1 = 2π(1.5)(25) / 500 ≈ 0.4712π\nΦ2 = 2π(1.2)(10) / 500 ≈ 0.1508π\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform to find the overall reflectivity (R):\n\nR = |r12 + r23 * exp(-2iΦ1) + r12 * r23 * exp(-2i(Φ1 + Φ2))|^2\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nR = |0.1111 - 0.0769 * exp(-0.9424πi) + 0.1111 * (-0.0769) * exp(-1.0932πi)|^2\n\nUsing a calculator to compute the complex exponential terms, we get:\n\nR ≈ |0.1111 - 0.0769 * (-0.9997 - 0.0239i) + 0.1111 * (-0.0769) * (-0.9986 + 0.0523i)|^2\n\nR ≈ |0.1111 + 0.0769 + 0.0018i + 0.0085 - 0.0040i|^2\n\nR ≈ |0.1965 + 0.0058i|^2\n\nR ≈ 0.0386\n\nSo, the reflectivity of the film at a wavelength of 500nm is approximately 3.86%."
