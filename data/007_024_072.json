    "message_2": "To solve the discrete logarithm problem 2^x ≡ 43 (mod 73), we can use the Baby-step Giant-step algorithm.\n\n1. Calculate m = ceil(sqrt(73 - 1)) = ceil(sqrt(72)) = 9\n2. Create two lists: baby_steps and giant_steps\n3. Calculate 2^m (mod 73) = 2^9 (mod 73) = 49\n4. Calculate the inverse of 49 (mod 73), which is 30 (since 49 * 30 ≡ 1 (mod 73))\n5. Fill the baby_steps list with powers of 2 from 0 to m - 1:\n   baby_steps = {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 8, 4: 16, 5: 32, 6: 64 (mod 73) = 64, 7: 128 (mod 73) = 55, 8: 110 (mod 73) = 37}\n6. Fill the giant_steps list with powers of 2^(-m) from 0 to m - 1:\n   giant_steps = {0: 43, 1: 43 * 30 (mod 73) = 1290 (mod 73) = 22, 2: 22 * 30 (mod 73) = 660 (mod 73) = 61, 3: 61 * 30 (mod 73) = 1830 (mod 73) = 52, 4: 52 * 30 (mod 73) = 1560 (mod 73) = 7}\n7. Find a match between the two lists: 37 is in both baby_steps and giant_steps\n8. Calculate x = i * m + j, where i and j are the indices of the matching element in the giant_steps and baby_steps lists, respectively:\n   x = 1 * 9 + 8 = 17\n\nSo, the solution to the discrete logarithm problem 2^x ≡ 43 (mod 73) is x = 17."
