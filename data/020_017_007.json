    "message_2": "To maximize the area of a rectangle with a given perimeter, we can use the following formula:\n\nArea = length × width\n\nGiven the perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 80 meters, we can write the perimeter formula as:\n\nP = 2 × (length + width)\n\nNow, we can solve for either length or width:\n\n80 = 2 × (length + width)\n40 = length + width\n\nLet's solve for width:\n\nwidth = 40 - length\n\nNow, we can express the area in terms of length:\n\nArea = length × (40 - length)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to length and set it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/d(length) = 0\n\nThe derivative of the area with respect to length is:\n\nd(Area)/d(length) = 40 - 2 × length\n\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n\n0 = 40 - 2 × length\n\nSolving for length:\n\n2 × length = 40\nlength = 20 meters\n\nNow, we can find the width:\n\nwidth = 40 - length\nwidth = 40 - 20\nwidth = 20 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that maximize its area are 20 meters by 20 meters."
