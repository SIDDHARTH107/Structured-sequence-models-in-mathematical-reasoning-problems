    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 8 meters. Find the area of the sector if the central angle is 45 degrees.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere the central angle is given in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 45 degrees, and the radius is 8 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (45 / 360) × π × 8²\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × π × 64\n\nArea of sector = 8π square meters\n\nSo, the area of the sector is 8π square meters."
