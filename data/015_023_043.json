    "message_1": "What is the value of the parameter k for which the Chirikov-Taylor map has a chaotic attractor?\n\nChirikov-Taylor map is given by the equation:\n\n    x_{n+1} = x_n + y_n - k/(2\\pi)\\sin(2\\pi x_n)\n    \n    y_{n+1} = y_n - k/(2\\pi)\\sin(2\\pi x_n)\n\nwhere x and y are the state variables and k is the parameter.",
    "message_2": "The Chirikov-Taylor map exhibits a chaotic attractor when the parameter k is greater than a critical value, which is approximately k â‰ˆ 1. For k > 1, the system exhibits chaotic behavior, and the attractor becomes more complex as k increases. However, it is important to note that the transition to chaos is not abrupt, and there may be regions of non-chaotic behavior even for k > 1."
