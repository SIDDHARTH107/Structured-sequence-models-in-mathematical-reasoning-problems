    "message_1": "A factory has 5 machines and it needs to produce 200 units of a product. Each machine has a different production capacity per hour. The capacities are 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 units per hour, respectively. What is the minimum number of hours needed to produce 200 units of the product using all 5 machines?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of hours needed to produce 200 units of the product using all 5 machines, we need to find the combined production capacity of all machines per hour and then divide the total units needed by the combined capacity.\n\nThe combined production capacity of all machines per hour is:\n20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 = 200 units per hour\n\nNow, we need to divide the total units needed (200) by the combined capacity (200):\n200 units / 200 units per hour = 1 hour\n\nSo, the minimum number of hours needed to produce 200 units of the product using all 5 machines is 1 hour."
