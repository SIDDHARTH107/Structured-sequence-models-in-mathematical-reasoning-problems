The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of A and B, A ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the elements in either A or B, but not in their intersection:\n\nA △ B = {1, 4} (1 is in A but not in B, and 4 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow, we need to find the union of this set with {2, 5}:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ {2, 5} = {1, 4} ∪ {2, 5}\n\nThe union of two sets is the set of all distinct elements from both sets:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ {2, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nSo, the final result is {1, 2, 4, 5}."
