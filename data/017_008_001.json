    "message_2": "In a group of order 8, the possible orders of elements are divisors of 8, which are 1, 2, 4, and 8. We will analyze each of the three groups (C8, Q8, and D4) to determine the number of elements of each order.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8:\nC8 = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}\nHere, e is the identity element, and a is a generator of the group.\nOrders of elements:\n- Order 1: e (1 element)\n- Order 2: a^4 (1 element)\n- Order 4: a^2, a^6 (2 elements)\n- Order 8: a, a^3, a^5, a^7 (4 elements)\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8:\nQ8 = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}\nOrders of elements:\n- Order 1: 1 (1 element)\n- Order 2: -1 (1 element)\n- Order 4: ±i, ±j, ±k (6 elements)\n\n3. Dihedral group D4:\nD4 is the group of symmetries of a square, and it has 8 elements.\nD4 = {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}\nHere, e is the identity element, r is a rotation by 90 degrees, and s is a reflection.\nOrders of elements:\n- Order 1: e (1 element)\n- Order 2: r^2, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3 (5 elements)\n- Order 4: r, r^3 (2 elements)\n\nIn summary, the number of elements of each order in the three groups are:\n\n- C8: Order 1 (1 element), Order 2 (1 element), Order 4 (2 elements), Order 8 (4 elements)\n- Q8: Order 1 (1 element), Order 2 (1 element), Order 4 (6 elements)\n- D4: Order 1 (1 element), Order 2 (5 elements), Order 4 (2 elements)\n\nAll three groups satisfy the criteria of having elements of orders 1, 2, and 4. However, only the cyclic group C8 has elements of order 8."
