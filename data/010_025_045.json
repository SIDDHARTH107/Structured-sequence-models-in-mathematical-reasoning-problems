    "message_2": "Using the formula provided, we can find the Euler characteristic (χ) of a closed orientable surface of genus 2:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nHere, g = 2 (as given in the problem). Plugging this value into the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface of genus 2 is -2."
