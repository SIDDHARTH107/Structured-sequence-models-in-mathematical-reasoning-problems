    "message_1": "A math student wants to investigate the relationship between study time and test scores. They gathered data from their classmates and found that the average study time (in hours) for a particular exam was 5 hours and the average test score was 80 out of 100. They also calculated that the standard deviation of study time was 2 hours and the standard deviation of test scores was 10. \n\nWhat is the correlation coefficient between study time and test scores?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient between study time and test scores, we need more information, specifically the covariance between the two variables. The correlation coefficient (r) is calculated using the following formula:\n\nr = covariance(X, Y) / (standard deviation of X * standard deviation of Y)\n\nIn this case, X represents study time and Y represents test scores. We have the standard deviations for both variables (2 hours for study time and 10 for test scores), but we don't have the covariance. If the student can provide the covariance between study time and test scores, we can then calculate the correlation coefficient."
