    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we first need to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nGiven equation: x^2 + xy + y^2 = 5\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^2) + d/dx(xy) + d/dx(y^2) = d/dx(5)\n\nUsing the chain rule:\n\n2x + (1 * y + x * dy/dx) + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx. We are given that x = 1, so we need to find the corresponding value of y. We can do this by plugging x = 1 into the original equation:\n\n(1)^2 + (1)(y) + y^2 = 5\n1 + y + y^2 = 5\ny^2 + y - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -4:\n\ny = (-1 ± sqrt(1^2 - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1)\ny = (-1 ± sqrt(17)) / 2\n\nThere are two possible values for y: y = (-1 + sqrt(17)) / 2 and y = (-1 - sqrt(17)) / 2. We need to find dy/dx for both of these values.\n\nFor y = (-1 + sqrt(17)) / 2:\n\nPlugging x = 1 and y = (-1 + sqrt(17)) / 2 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(1) + (1 * ((-1 + sqrt(17)) / 2) + 1 * dy/dx) + 2((-1 + sqrt(17)) / 2)(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = - (2 + (-1 + sqrt(17)) / 2) / (1 + (-1 + sqrt(17)))\n\ndy/dx = - (3 + sqrt(17)) / (sqrt(17))\n\nFor y = (-1 - sqrt(17)) / 2:\n\nPlugging x = 1 and y = (-1 - sqrt(17)) / 2 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(1) + (1 * ((-1 - sqrt(17)) / 2) + 1 * dy/dx) + 2((-1 - sqrt(17)) / 2)(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = - (2 + (-1 - sqrt(17)) / 2) / (1 + (-1 - sqrt(17)))\n\ndy/dx = - (3 - sqrt(17)) / (-sqrt(17))\n\nSo, we have two possible values for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = - (3 + sqrt(17)) / (sqrt(17))\n\ndy/dx = - (3 - sqrt(17)) / (-sqrt(17))\n\nThese are the derivatives of y with respect to x when x = 1 for the given implicit function."
