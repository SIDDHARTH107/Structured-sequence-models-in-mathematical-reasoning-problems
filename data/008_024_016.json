    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by -2:\n\n-6x - 8y = -40\n(-6x - 8y) / -2 = -40 / -2\n3x + 4y = 20\n\nNow we have two equations that are the same:\n\n1) 3x + 4y = 20\n2) 3x + 4y = 20\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system.\n\nTo express the solution set in vector form, we can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x:\n\n3x + 4y = 20\n4y = -3x + 20\ny = (-3/4)x + 5\n\nNow we can express the solution set in vector form using a parameter t:\n\nx = 4t\ny = -3t + 5\n\nSo the solution set in vector form is:\n\n(4t, -3t + 5)"
