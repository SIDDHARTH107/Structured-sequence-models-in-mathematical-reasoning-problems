    "message_1": "A math student is given the following problem in symplectic geometry:\nConsider a symplectic vector space V of dimension 4 with a symplectic form $\\omega$. Let $W$ be a subspace of dimension 2 such that $W$ is isotropic (i.e., $\\omega(w_1,w_2) = 0$ for all $w_1,w_2 \\in W$). Find the dimension of the Lagrangian subspace $L$ of $V$ containing $W$.",
    "message_2": "A Lagrangian subspace is a subspace $L$ of a symplectic vector space $V$ such that $L$ is isotropic and has the maximal possible dimension, which is half the dimension of $V$. In this case, the dimension of $V$ is 4, so the maximal possible dimension for an isotropic subspace is 2.\n\nSince $W$ is already an isotropic subspace of dimension 2, it has the maximal possible dimension for an isotropic subspace in $V$. Therefore, $W$ itself is a Lagrangian subspace of $V$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the Lagrangian subspace $L$ of $V$ containing $W$ is equal to the dimension of $W$, which is 2."
