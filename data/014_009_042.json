    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. If we use 16 rounds of encryption, how many unique keys can be used in this cipher?",
    "message_2": "The number of unique keys that can be used in this cipher is determined by the key size, which is 128 bits. To calculate the total number of unique keys, we use the formula:\n\nNumber of unique keys = 2^(key size)\n\nIn this case, the key size is 128 bits, so the number of unique keys is:\n\nNumber of unique keys = 2^128 â‰ˆ 3.4 x 10^38\n\nSo, there are approximately 3.4 x 10^38 unique keys that can be used in this Feistel cipher."
