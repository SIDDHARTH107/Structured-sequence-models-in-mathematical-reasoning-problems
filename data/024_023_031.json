    "message_2": "To find the symmetries of the given manifold with respect to the x-axis and y-axis, we need to check if the equation remains the same after applying the reflection transformations.\n\n1. Reflection with respect to the x-axis:\nIn this case, we replace y with -y in the equation and check if it remains the same.\n\n(x^2) + (-y)^2 - 2a(x) = x^2 + y^2 - 2ax\n\nAs we can see, the equation remains the same after reflecting with respect to the x-axis. Therefore, the manifold has symmetry with respect to the x-axis.\n\n2. Reflection with respect to the y-axis:\nIn this case, we replace x with -x in the equation and check if it remains the same.\n\n(-x)^2 + y^2 - 2a(-x) = x^2 + y^2 + 2ax\n\nAs we can see, the equation does not remain the same after reflecting with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the manifold does not have symmetry with respect to the y-axis.\n\nIn conclusion, the given manifold has symmetry with respect to the x-axis but not with respect to the y-axis."
