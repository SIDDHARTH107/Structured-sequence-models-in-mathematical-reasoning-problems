    "message_2": "Maxwell's equations are a set of four fundamental equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. For this problem, we will focus on Ampere's Law with Maxwell's addition, which relates the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire to the current passing through it.\n\nAmpere's Law with Maxwell's addition is given by:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * (I + ε₀ * dΦ_E/dt)\n\nIn this case, since the wire is carrying a steady current and there is no changing electric field, the term ε₀ * dΦ_E/dt becomes zero. So, the equation simplifies to:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm (0.02 m) from the center of the wire. We will use the Biot-Savart Law for a long straight wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the center of the wire.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.04 m)\n\nB = 5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire is 5 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
