    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nFor sets A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8}, we can find the symmetric difference as follows:\n\n1. Union of A and B (A ∪ B): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n2. Intersection of A and B (A ∩ B): {} (since A and B have no common elements)\n3. Symmetric difference of A and B (A Δ B): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (subtracting the intersection from the union)\n\nNow, to show that the symmetric difference is commutative, we need to prove that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nUsing the definition of symmetric difference, we can write:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection operations are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we can rewrite the above equations as:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nAs we can see, A Δ B and B Δ A are equal, which means the symmetric difference operation is commutative."
