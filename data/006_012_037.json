    "message_2": "To find the probability of a burglary happening in a particular neighborhood, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the successful outcome is a burglary, and there have been 40 burglaries in the past year. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of households, which is 5000.\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary happening in the neighborhood is:\n\nProbability = 40 / 5000\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\nProbability = 0.008\n\nTo express the probability as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:\n\nProbability = 0.008 * 100 = 0.8%\n\nTherefore, the probability of a burglary happening in the particular neighborhood is 0.8%."
