    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, producing an identical product. Each firm sets a price for their product simultaneously. Assume that the cost of producing one unit of the product is $2. Firm A's price is denoted by p and Firm B's price is denoted by q. The demand function for the product is given by:\n\n    P = 100 - Q,\n\nwhere P denotes price and Q denotes quantity demanded.\n\nIf both firms behave rationally and seek to maximize profits, what prices will they charge?",
    "message_2": "To find the prices that both firms will charge, we need to first find the demand for each firm's product. Since the products are identical, we can assume that the consumers will buy from the firm with the lower price. If both firms charge the same price, we can assume that they will split the market demand equally.\n\nLet Q_A and Q_B be the quantity demanded for Firm A and Firm B, respectively. Then, we have the following cases:\n\n1. If p < q, then Q_A = 100 - p and Q_B = 0.\n2. If p > q, then Q_A = 0 and Q_B = 100 - q.\n3. If p = q, then Q_A = Q_B = (100 - p)/2.\n\nNow, let's find the profit functions for both firms. Profit is given by the difference between total revenue and total cost. The total cost for each firm is the cost per unit times the quantity produced.\n\nProfit_A = (p - 2) * Q_A\nProfit_B = (q - 2) * Q_B\n\nFor each firm to maximize their profit, they will choose a price that maximizes their profit function given the other firm's price. This is a Nash equilibrium problem. We can find the Nash equilibrium by taking the first-order conditions of the profit functions with respect to each firm's price and solving for the equilibrium prices.\n\n1. If p < q:\n    d(Profit_A)/dp = (1 - Q_A) = 0 => Q_A = 1\n    p = 100 - Q_A = 99\n\n2. If p > q:\n    d(Profit_B)/dq = (1 - Q_B) = 0 => Q_B = 1\n    q = 100 - Q_B = 99\n\n3. If p = q:\n    d(Profit_A)/dp = (1 - Q_A/2) = 0 => Q_A = 2\n    p = q = 100 - Q_A = 98\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the Nash equilibrium occurs when both firms charge the same price, which is $98. This is the price that both firms will charge to maximize their profits."
