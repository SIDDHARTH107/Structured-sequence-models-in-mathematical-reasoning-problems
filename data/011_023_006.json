    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is determined by the chromatic number of the graph. The chromatic number depends on the structure of the graph and its maximum degree (the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex).\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, G is a complete graph (every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices, which is 10. So, in the worst-case scenario, you would need 10 colors to color the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nHowever, without more information about the structure of the graph G, we cannot determine the exact minimum number of colors needed."
