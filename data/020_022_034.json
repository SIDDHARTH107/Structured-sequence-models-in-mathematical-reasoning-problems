    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while the production of Product B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time. There are 100 hours of labor and 120 hours of machine time available per week. These products are sold at a profit of $10 and $15 respectively. Determine the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B that can be produced within the given constraints of labor and machine time. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints can be written as follows:\n\nLabor constraint: 2x + y ≤ 100\nMachine time constraint: x + 3y ≤ 120\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Solve the labor constraint for y:\n\ny ≤ -2x + 100\n\n2. Solve the machine time constraint for y:\n\ny ≤ -1/3x + 40\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the points of intersection:\n\nIntersection of labor constraint and machine time constraint:\n\n-2x + 100 = -1/3x + 40\n(5/3)x = 60\nx = 36\n\ny = -2(36) + 100\ny = 28\n\nIntersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x=0):\n\ny = -2(0) + 100\ny = 100\n\nIntersection of machine time constraint and x-axis (y=0):\n\nx = 0 + 3(0)\nx = 0\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 100), (0, 0), and (36, 28).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 100): 10(0) + 15(100) = $1500\n2. Profit at (0, 0): 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n3. Profit at (36, 28): 10(36) + 15(28) = $720\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (36, 28), where the profit is $720. Therefore, the company should produce 36 units of Product A and 28 units of Product B to maximize their profit."
