    "message_2": "The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 84 and 120 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide 120 by 84 and find the remainder: 120 = 84 × 1 + 36\n2. Replace the larger number (120) with the remainder (36) and repeat the process: 84 = 36 × 2 + 12\n3. Continue this process until the remainder is 0: 36 = 12 × 3 + 0\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is 12, so the GCD of 84 and 120 is 12."
