The weights and volumes of the goods are uncertain and can vary within a certain range. The company wants to minimize the expected shipping cost while ensuring that all demands are met. If the shipping cost per unit weight and per unit volume is $10 and $5 respectively, and the minimum and maximum weights and volumes of the goods are as follows:\n\n- Warehouse 1: Minimum weight = 1000kg, maximum weight = 2000kg, minimum volume = 20m^3, maximum volume = 40m^3\n- Warehouse 2: Minimum weight = 1500kg, maximum weight = 2500kg, minimum volume = 15m^3, maximum volume = 30m^3\n- Warehouse 3: Minimum weight = 500kg, maximum weight = 1500kg, minimum volume = 10m^3, maximum volume = 25m^3\n\nAnd the demands at the three retail stores are:\n\n- Store 1: 1500kg, 30m^3\n- Store 2: 2000kg, 25m^3\n- Store 3: 1000kg, 20m^3\n\nFormulate the robust optimization problem that will minimize the expected shipping cost for the shipping company.",

We want to minimize the total shipping cost, which is the sum of the costs for shipping the weight and volume from each warehouse to each store.\n\nObjective function:\nMinimize C = 10 * (x_11 + x_12 + x_13 + x_21 + x_22 + x_23 + x_31 + x_32 + x_33) + 5 * (y_11 + y_12 + y_13 + y_21 + y_22 + y_23 + y_31 + y_32 + y_33)\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1.
