The weights of a random sample of 25 birds are taken and the mean weight is found to be 34 grams with a standard deviation of 6 grams. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the species in the region.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the species in the region, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\nMean = 34 grams\nStandard Deviation = 6 grams\nSample Size = 25 birds\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 6 / √(25) = 6 / 5 = 1.2 grams\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 34 ± (1.96 * 1.2)\n\nLower Bound = 34 - (1.96 * 1.2) = 34 - 2.352 = 31.648 grams\nUpper Bound = 34 + (1.96 * 1.2) = 34 + 2.352 = 36.352 grams\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the species in the region is approximately (31.648 grams, 36.352 grams)."
