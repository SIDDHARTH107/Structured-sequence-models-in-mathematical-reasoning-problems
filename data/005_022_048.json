    "message_1": "A math student is studying Robust Statistics and is asked to find the median of the following data set: \n\n{3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90, 100, 250, 500}\n\nUsing the traditional method, the median turns out to be 25. However, if an outlier of 500 is removed, what is the new median?",
    "message_2": "If we remove the outlier of 500, the new data set becomes:\n\n{3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90, 100, 250}\n\nThere are now 19 data points. To find the median, we take the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. Since there are an odd number of data points, the median will be the value at the position (19+1)/2 = 10th position.\n\nThe new median is 25."
