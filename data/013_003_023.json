    "message_1": "Consider an Ultimatum Game where player 1 has an endowment of 10 coins and proposes a split to player 2. Player 2 can either accept the proposal and the coins are split accordingly or reject the proposal and both players receive nothing. If player 2 accepts any proposal, what is the minimum amount player 1 needs to offer to player 2 to make the proposal acceptable at a 50/50 decision?",
    "message_2": "If player 2 accepts any proposal, then the minimum amount player 1 needs to offer to player 2 to make the proposal acceptable at a 50/50 decision is 1 coin. This is because player 2 would prefer to receive 1 coin rather than nothing if they reject the proposal. So, the split would be 9 coins for player 1 and 1 coin for player 2."
