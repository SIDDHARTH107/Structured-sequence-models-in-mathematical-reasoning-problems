    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 6 cm and a height of length 8 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 6 cm and b = 8 cm. So, we have:\n\nc² = a² + b²\nc² = 6² + 8²\nc² = 36 + 64\nc² = 100\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 100 to get the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = √100\nc = 10\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm."
