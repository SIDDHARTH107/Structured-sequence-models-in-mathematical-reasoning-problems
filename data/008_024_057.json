    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the system of linear equations by dividing each equation by their greatest common divisor:\n\n1) Divide the first equation by 1 (it's already simplified):\n3x - 2y + 4z = 7\n\n2) Divide the second equation by 2:\n3x - 2y + 4z = 7\n\n3) Divide the third equation by 3:\n3x - 2y + 4z = 7\n\nNow, we can see that all three equations are the same:\n\n3x - 2y + 4z = 7\n\nThis means that the system of linear equations has infinite solutions, as all three planes represented by the equations coincide with each other.\n\nTo find two different solutions, we can set one variable to a constant value and solve for the other two variables. Let's set z = 0 and z = 1:\n\nWhen z = 0:\n3x - 2y = 7\nWe can solve for x or y. Let's solve for x:\nx = (7 + 2y) / 3\n\nWhen z = 1:\n3x - 2y + 4(1) = 7\n3x - 2y = 3\nx = (3 + 2y) / 3\n\nNow let's find two different solutions by choosing different values for y:\n\n1) Let y = 0:\nFor z = 0: x = (7 + 2(0)) / 3 = 7/3\nSolution 1: (7/3, 0, 0)\n\nFor z = 1: x = (3 + 2(0)) / 3 = 1\nSolution 2: (1, 0, 1)\n\nSo, we found two different solutions for the system of linear equations: (7/3, 0, 0) and (1, 0, 1)."
