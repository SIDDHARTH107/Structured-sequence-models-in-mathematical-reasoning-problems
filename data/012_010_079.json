    "message_2": "A minimum vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set, and the set has the smallest possible number of vertices.\n\nIn the given graph, we can find a minimum vertex cover by selecting the following vertices: {B, D, F}. This set of vertices covers all the edges in the graph, and no smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges.\n\nSo, the minimum vertex cover of the graph is {B, D, F}."
