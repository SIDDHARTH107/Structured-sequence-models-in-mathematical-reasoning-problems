If the car started at a mile marker reading 30, what is the estimated mile marker reading where the car was halfway through the journey? Use the mean value theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To use the mean value theorem, we first need to find the total distance traveled by the car. \n\nThe car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for a duration of 3 hours, so the total distance traveled is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\nDistance = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nSince the car started at a mile marker reading 30, the final mile marker reading is:\n\nFinal mile marker = Initial mile marker + Distance traveled\nFinal mile marker = 30 + 180 = 210\n\nNow, we want to find the mile marker halfway through the journey. Since the car traveled 180 miles, halfway would be at 90 miles into the journey. \n\nTo find the mile marker at this point, we add 90 miles to the initial mile marker:\n\nHalfway mile marker = Initial mile marker + Half of the distance traveled\nHalfway mile marker = 30 + 90 = 120\n\nSo, the estimated mile marker reading where the car was halfway through the journey is 120."
