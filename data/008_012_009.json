    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 5 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7 |\n    | 8 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (2 * -2) - (3 * 5) = -4 - 15 = -19\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the inverse of A using the formula A^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjoint(A), where adjoint(A) is the matrix obtained by replacing each element with its cofactor and then taking the transpose.\n\nAdjoint(A) = | -2 -3 |\n                     | -5  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-19) * | -2 -3 |\n                             | -5  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 2/19  3/19 |\n                | 5/19 -2/19 |\n\nNow, we multiply A^(-1) with B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | 2/19  3/19 | * | 7 |\n       | 5/19 -2/19 |    | 8 |\n\nX = | (2/19 * 7) + (3/19 * 8) |\n       | (5/19 * 7) + (-2/19 * 8) |\n\nX = | 14/19 + 24/19 |\n       | 35/19 - 16/19 |\n\nX = | 38/19 |\n       | 19/19 |\n\nX = | 2 |\n       | 1 |\n\nSo, the solution of the given system of linear equations is x = 2 and y = 1."
