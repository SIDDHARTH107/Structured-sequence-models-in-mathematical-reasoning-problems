    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the pole of the given complex function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 - 4z + 3) at the point z = 3, we first need to factor the denominator and see if there is a pole at z = 3.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^2 - 4z + 3 = (z - 3)(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can see that there is a pole at z = 3, as the denominator becomes zero at this point. To find the order of the pole, we need to determine the multiplicity of the factor (z - 3) in the denominator.\n\nSince (z - 3) appears only once in the denominator, the order of the pole at z = 3 is 1. This means that the pole is a simple pole."
