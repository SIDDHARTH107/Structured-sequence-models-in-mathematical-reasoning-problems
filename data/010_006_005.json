    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of the space X∖{(1,0),(-1,0)}, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, let's cover the space X∖{(1,0),(-1,0)} with two open sets U and V such that U∩V is path-connected.\n\nLet U be the open set containing the upper semicircle and a small open neighborhood around the points (1,0) and (-1,0), and let V be the open set containing the lower semicircle and a small open neighborhood around the points (1,0) and (-1,0). Then, U∩V is an open set containing two disjoint intervals, one around (1,0) and the other around (-1,0).\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of U and V is trivial, as they are both contractible to a point. The fundamental group of U∩V is isomorphic to the free group on two generators, say a and b, corresponding to the loops around (1,0) and (-1,0), respectively.\n\nThe Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that the fundamental group of X∖{(1,0),(-1,0)} is the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the relations between the fundamental groups of U∩V. In this case, the only relation is that the loop around (1,0) in U is equal to the loop around (1,0) in V, and similarly for the loop around (-1,0). Therefore, the fundamental group of X∖{(1,0),(-1,0)} is the free group on two generators a and b, which can be denoted as F_2 or ⟨a, b⟩.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the space X∖{(1,0),(-1,0)} is the free group on two generators, ⟨a, b⟩."
