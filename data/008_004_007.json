The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n|  2  4 -3 | 0 |\n|  6 -2  4 | 0 |\n| -1  5 -8 | 0 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 3 to have a non-zero element in the top-left corner:\n\n| -1  5 -8 | 0 |\n|  6 -2  4 | 0 |\n|  2  4 -3 | 0 |\n\nStep 2: Add 6 times Row 1 to Row 2 and 2 times Row 1 to Row 3 to eliminate the first element in Row 2 and Row 3:\n\n| -1  5 -8 | 0 |\n|  0 28 -44| 0 |\n|  0 14 -13| 0 |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 2 to simplify:\n\n| -1  5 -8 | 0 |\n|  0 14 -22| 0 |\n|  0 14 -13| 0 |\n\nStep 4: Subtract Row 2 from Row 3 to eliminate the second element in Row 3:\n\n| -1  5 -8 | 0 |\n|  0 14 -22| 0 |\n|  0  0  9 | 0 |\n\nNow we have the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n| -1  5 -8 | 0 |\n|  0 14 -22| 0 |\n|  0  0  9 | 0 |\n\nNow we can write the system of linear equations corresponding to this matrix:\n\n-1x + 5y - 8z = 0\n14y - 22z = 0\n9z = 0\n\nFrom the third equation, we have:\n\n9z = 0 => z = 0\n\nNow, substitute z = 0 into the second equation:\n\n14y - 22(0) = 0 => 14y = 0 => y = 0\n\nFinally, substitute y = 0 and z = 0 into the first equation:\n\n-1x + 5(0) - 8(0) = 0 => -1x = 0 => x = 0\n\nSo the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 0, y = 0, z = 0"
