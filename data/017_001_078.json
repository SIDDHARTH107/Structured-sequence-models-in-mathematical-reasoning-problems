    "message_2": "Let's denote the group of all bijective functions from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} to itself as G. The operation in G is the composition of functions. We want to show that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4.\n\nFirst, let's find the order of G. Since there are 4 elements in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, there are 4! = 24 possible bijective functions. So, the order of G is 24.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G. Since the order of G is 24, by the Sylow theorems, G can have subgroups of order 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12. However, G cannot be isomorphic to C4 or V4 if it has a subgroup of order 6 or 8. Therefore, we only need to consider the cases where G has subgroups of order 2, 3, or 4.\n\nCase 1: G has a subgroup of order 2.\nIn this case, G could be isomorphic to V4. V4 has three elements of order 2 and one identity element. We can find such elements in G:\n\n1. The identity function, which maps each element to itself: f(x) = x.\n2. A function that swaps two elements and leaves the other two unchanged: f(x) = (1 2)(3 4).\n3. A function that swaps the other pair of elements: f(x) = (1 3)(2 4).\n4. A function that swaps both pairs of elements: f(x) = (1 4)(2 3).\n\nThese four functions form a subgroup of G isomorphic to V4.\n\nCase 2: G has a subgroup of order 3.\nIn this case, G could be isomorphic to C4. However, since the order of G is 24, which is not divisible by 3, G cannot have a subgroup of order 3.\n\nCase 3: G has a subgroup of order 4.\nIn this case, G could be isomorphic to C4. We can find a cyclic subgroup of order 4 in G:\n\n1. The identity function, which maps each element to itself: f(x) = x.\n2. A function that cycles three elements and leaves one unchanged: f(x) = (1 2 3).\n3. The inverse of the previous function: f(x) = (1 3 2).\n4. A function that cycles the other three elements: f(x) = (1 4 3).\n\nThese four functions form a subgroup of G isomorphic to C4.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of all bijective functions from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} to itself, under the operation of composition of functions, can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
