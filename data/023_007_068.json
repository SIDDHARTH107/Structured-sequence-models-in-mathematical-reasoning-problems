    "message_1": "A signal f(x) has the Fourier transform F(k) = 3/(5-2ik), where k is the frequency variable. Determine the frequency content of the signal f(x).",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequency content of the signal f(x), we need to analyze its Fourier transform F(k) = 3/(5-2ik). The frequency content of a signal is represented by the magnitudes of its Fourier transform at different frequencies.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of F(k):\n\n|F(k)| = |3/(5-2ik)|\n\nTo find the magnitude of a complex number in the form a + bi, we use the formula |a + bi| = √(a² + b²). In this case, a = 3/(5-2ik) and b = 0.\n\n|F(k)| = √((3/(5-2ik))² + 0²)\n|F(k)| = √((3/(5-2ik))²)\n|F(k)| = 3/√((5-2ik)(5+2ik))\n\nNow, let's multiply the denominator by its conjugate:\n\n|F(k)| = 3/√((5² + (2ik)²))\n|F(k)| = 3/√(25 + 4k²)\n\nThe magnitude of F(k) represents the strength of the frequency components in the signal f(x). The frequency content of the signal can be determined by analyzing the behavior of the magnitude as a function of the frequency variable k.\n\nAs k increases, the magnitude |F(k)| decreases, which means that the signal f(x) has more energy at lower frequencies and less energy at higher frequencies. This indicates that the frequency content of the signal is concentrated at lower frequencies.\n\nIn summary, the frequency content of the signal f(x) is characterized by a higher concentration of energy at lower frequencies and a decrease in energy as the frequency increases."
