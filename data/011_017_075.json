    "message_1": "A Latin square of order 3 is a 3x3 grid in which each cell contains a different integer from 1 to 3, such that each row and each column contains each integer exactly once. \n\nWhat is the total number of possible Latin squares of order 3?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of possible Latin squares of order 3, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Fill in the first row with the integers 1, 2, and 3 in any order. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to do this, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\n2. Now, fill in the second row. The first number in the second row must be different from the first number in the first row, so there are 2 choices for the first number in the second row. The second number in the second row must be different from both the second number in the first row and the first number in the second row, so there is only 1 choice for the second number in the second row. The third number in the second row is determined by the first two numbers, so there is only 1 choice for the third number in the second row. Therefore, there are 2 × 1 × 1 = 2 ways to fill in the second row.\n\n3. Finally, fill in the third row. Since each number in the third row must be different from the corresponding numbers in the first and second rows, there is only 1 way to fill in the third row.\n\nMultiplying the number of ways to fill in each row, we get 6 × 2 × 1 = 12 possible Latin squares of order 3."
