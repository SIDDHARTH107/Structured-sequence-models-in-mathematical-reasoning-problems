    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2  3  4 | 17 ]\n[ 4  5  6 | 24 ]\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first variable (x) from the second and third rows.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 4 * Row1\n\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 0 -1 -2 | -12 ]\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second variable (y) from the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 + Row2\n\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 0  0  0 | -7 ]\n\nAt this point, we have a row of all zeros with a non-zero value on the right side of the augmented matrix (0 = -7). This indicates that the system of equations is inconsistent and has no solution.\n\nSince the system has no solution, the matrix is singular, meaning it does not have an inverse."
