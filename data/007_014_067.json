    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. Perfect numbers can be generated using the formula (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers.\n\nThe 5th perfect number can be found by finding the next pair of prime numbers that fit this condition:\n\n1. p = 2, (2^2 - 1) = 3 (both prime) => 1st perfect number: (2^(2-1)) * (2^2 - 1) = 6\n2. p = 3, (2^3 - 1) = 7 (both prime) => 2nd perfect number: (2^(3-1)) * (2^3 - 1) = 28\n3. p = 5, (2^5 - 1) = 31 (both prime) => 3rd perfect number: (2^(5-1)) * (2^5 - 1) = 496\n4. p = 7, (2^7 - 1) = 127 (both prime) => 4th perfect number: (2^(7-1)) * (2^7 - 1) = 8128\n5. p = 13, (2^13 - 1) = 8191 (both prime) => 5th perfect number: (2^(13-1)) * (2^13 - 1) = 33,550,336\n\nSo, the 5th perfect number is 33,550,336."
