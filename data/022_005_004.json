Then evaluate the contour integral of f(z) around the simple closed curve C given by |z-2|=2pi, in the counterclockwise direction.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z=1.\n\nf(z) = (z+2)/(z^2 + 3z - 4)\n\nTo find the residue, we need to factor the denominator and identify the order of the pole.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^2 + 3z - 4 = (z-1)(z+4)\n\nNow we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (z+2)/((z-1)(z+4))\n\nSince the pole z=1 is a simple pole (order 1), we can find the residue by taking the limit as z approaches 1:\n\nRes[f(z), z=1] = lim (z->1) [(z-1)(z+2)/((z-1)(z+4))] = lim (z->1) [(z+2)/(z+4)]\n\nRes[f(z), z=1] = (1+2)/(1+4) = 3/5\n\nNow, let's evaluate the contour integral of f(z) around the simple closed curve C given by |z-2|=2π, in the counterclockwise direction.\n\nSince the contour C is centered at z=2 with radius 2π, the pole z=1 is inside the contour. According to the residue theorem, the contour integral of f(z) around C is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of f(z) inside C.\n\nIn this case, there is only one pole (z=1) inside the contour, so the contour integral is:\n\n∮[C] f(z) dz = 2πi * Res[f(z), z=1] = 2πi * (3/5)\n\n∮[C] f(z) dz = (6/5)πi"
