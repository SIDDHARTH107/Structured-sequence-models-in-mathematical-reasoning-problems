    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+3) + log(x-2) = 2, we can first combine the two logarithms using the logarithm product rule, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(a*b). \n\nSo, log((x+3)(x-2)) = 2.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form to get rid of the logarithm. In this case, we have a common logarithm (base 10), so the equation becomes:\n\n10^2 = (x+3)(x-2).\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n100 = x^2 - 2x + 3x - 6.\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 + x - 106 = 0.\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a,\n\nwhere a = 1, b = 1, and c = -106.\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4(1)(-106))) / 2(1),\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1 + 424)) / 2,\n\nx = (-1 ± √425) / 2.\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (-1 + √425) / 2 ≈ 9.37228,\n\nx = (-1 - √425) / 2 ≈ -11.37228.\n\nHowever, since we have a logarithm in the original equation, we need to make sure that the solutions are valid (i.e., the arguments of the logarithms must be positive). \n\nFor x ≈ 9.37228, we have:\n\nlog(9.37228 + 3) > 0 (since 9.37228 + 3 > 0),\n\nlog(9.37228 - 2) > 0 (since 9.37228 - 2 > 0).\n\nSo, x ≈ 9.37228 is a valid solution.\n\nFor x ≈ -11.37228, we have:\n\nlog(-11.37228 + 3) is not defined (since -11.37228 + 3 < 0),\n\nlog(-11.37228 - 2) is not defined (since -11.37228 - 2 < 0).\n\nSo, x ≈ -11.37228 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for the equation is x ≈ 9.37228."
