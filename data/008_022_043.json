Check if the matrix is ill-conditioned and interpret your results.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n|  3  5 -2 | 1 |\n|  6 10 -4 | 2 |\n|  9 15 -6 | 3 |\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  5/3 -2/3 | 1/3 |\n|  6  10  -4  |  2  |\n|  9  15  -6  |  3  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows by subtracting multiples of the first row:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 6 * Row1:\n|  1  5/3 -2/3 | 1/3  |\n|  0    0   0  |  0   |\n|  9  15  -6   |  3   |\n\nRow3 = Row3 - 9 * Row1:\n|  1  5/3 -2/3 | 1/3  |\n|  0    0   0  |  0   |\n|  0    0   0  |  0   |\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the system of linear equations is dependent. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, and the system cannot be solved for unique values of x, y, and z.\n\nTo check if the matrix is ill-conditioned, let's calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix:\n\n|  3  5 -2 |\n|  6 10 -4 |\n|  9 15 -6 |\n\nThe determinant can be calculated as follows:\n\ndet = 3 * (10 * (-6) - (-4) * 15) - 5 * (6 * (-6) - (-4) * 9) + (-2) * (6 * 15 - 10 * 9)\n\ndet = 3 * (0) - 5 * (0) + (-2) * (0)\n\ndet = 0\n\nSince the determinant is 0, the matrix is singular and ill-conditioned. This confirms our earlier observation that the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution."
