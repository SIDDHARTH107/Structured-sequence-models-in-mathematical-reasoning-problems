    "message_1": "A company wants to study the relationship between the number of years of work experience and the salary of its employees. The data of 10 randomly selected employees are shown below:\n\nYears of Work Experience: 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25\n\nSalary (in thousands): 35, 42, 50, 60, 68, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95\n\nUsing the regression equation, what is the expected salary of an employee who has 8 years of work experience?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected salary of an employee with 8 years of work experience, we need to calculate the linear regression equation. The equation is in the form y = mx + b, where y is the salary, x is the years of work experience, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of the years of work experience (x) and the mean of the salary (y).\n\nMean of years of work experience (x̄) = (3 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20 + 22 + 25) / 10 = 137 / 10 = 13.7\n\nMean of salary (ȳ) = (35 + 42 + 50 + 60 + 68 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95) / 10 = 680 / 10 = 68\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (m). To do this, we will use the formula:\n\nm = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n(3-13.7)(35-68) + (5-13.7)(42-68) + ... + (25-13.7)(95-68)\n= (-10.7)(-33) + (-8.7)(-26) + ... + (11.3)(27)\n= 353.1 + 226.2 + ... + 305.1\n= 2265.5\n\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n\n(-10.7)^2 + (-8.7)^2 + ... + (11.3)^2\n= 114.49 + 75.69 + ... + 127.69\n= 1147.3\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator to find the slope:\n\nm = 2265.5 / 1147.3 ≈ 1.974\n\nNow we need to find the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄\nb = 68 - 1.974 * 13.7\nb ≈ 68 - 27.0638\nb ≈ 40.9362\n\nNow we have the linear regression equation:\n\ny = 1.974x + 40.9362\n\nTo find the expected salary for an employee with 8 years of work experience, plug in x = 8:\n\ny = 1.974 * 8 + 40.9362\ny ≈ 15.792 + 40.9362\ny ≈ 56.7282\n\nThe expected salary for an employee with 8 years of work experience is approximately $56,728."
