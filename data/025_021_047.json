    "message_2": "To find the image of the parabola in the mirror, we need to reflect the parabola across the x-axis. Since the mirror is placed vertically along the x-axis, the reflection will only affect the y-coordinates of the points on the parabola.\n\nLet's consider a point (x, y) on the parabola y = x^2 - 4. When this point is reflected across the x-axis, its x-coordinate remains the same, but its y-coordinate becomes the negative of its original value. So, the reflected point will be (x, -y).\n\nNow, we know that y = x^2 - 4. So, -y = -(x^2 - 4) = -x^2 + 4.\n\nThus, the equation of the image of the parabola in the mirror is:\n\ny = -x^2 + 4"
