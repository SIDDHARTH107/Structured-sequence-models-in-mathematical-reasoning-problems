    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that can be constructed by repeatedly replacing the middle third of each line segment with two segments that form an equilateral triangle with the removed segment. In each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 3, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of the previous length.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the nth iteration as P(n) and the length of the initial triangle as L.\n\nFor the first iteration (n=1), the perimeter is P(1) = 3 * (L/3) = L.\n\nFor the second iteration (n=2), the perimeter is P(2) = 3 * P(1) * (1/3) = L.\n\nFor the third iteration (n=3), the perimeter is P(3) = 3 * P(2) * (1/3) = L.\n\nFor the fourth iteration (n=4), the perimeter is P(4) = 3 * P(3) * (1/3) = L.\n\nFor the fifth iteration (n=5), the perimeter is P(5) = 3 * P(4) * (1/3) = L.\n\nSince the length of the initial triangle is 4 units, the perimeter of the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is 4 units."
