    "message_1": "A ship is travelling in a direction of 40° North of East with a velocity of 20 m/s. Determine the component of its velocity in the East direction. Round the answer to the nearest meter per second.",
    "message_2": "To determine the component of the ship's velocity in the East direction, we can use the cosine function. The Eastward component of the velocity can be found using the formula:\n\nEastward velocity = total velocity × cos(angle)\n\nIn this case, the total velocity is 20 m/s, and the angle is 40° North of East. \n\nEastward velocity = 20 m/s × cos(40°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n40° × (π/180) = 0.698 radians\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle:\n\ncos(0.698) ≈ 0.766\n\nFinally, we can calculate the Eastward velocity:\n\nEastward velocity = 20 m/s × 0.766 ≈ 15.32 m/s\n\nRounding to the nearest meter per second, the Eastward component of the ship's velocity is approximately 15 m/s."
