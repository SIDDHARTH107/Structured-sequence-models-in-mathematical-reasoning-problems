The weights of the edges are as follows:\n\n- A -> B : 2\n- A -> C : 1\n- B -> C : 3\n- B -> D : 5\n- C -> E : 1\n- D -> F : 2\n- E -> G : 3\n- F -> G : 4\n- C -> G : 6\n\nFind the shortest path between node A and node G, and calculate its total weight.",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node A and node G, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (A) to 0 and the distance to all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Set the current node to the starting node (A).\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative distance to that neighbor through the current node. If the calculated distance is less than the current distance, update the distance.\n4. Mark the current node as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance as the new current node and repeat steps 3-5 until all nodes have been visited or the target node (G) has been visited.\n\nFollowing these steps, we get the following shortest path and its total weight:\n\nA -> C : 1\nC -> E : 1\nE -> G : 3\n\nShortest path: A -> C -> E -> G\nTotal weight: 1 + 1 + 3 = 5"
