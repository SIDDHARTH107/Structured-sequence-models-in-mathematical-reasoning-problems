    "message_1": "Let U be a universal set such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Let A = {2, 4, 6, 8} be a subset of U. What is the complement of set A and what is the union of set A and its complement? Show that the resulting set is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', is given by:\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nSo, we can list out the elements in A' as follows:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements that are in either of the two sets. \n\nA ∪ A' = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A or x ∈ A'}\n\nBy combining the elements of set A and A', we get:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's compare this resulting set with the universal set U:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSince the resulting set A ∪ A' contains all the elements of the universal set U and no additional elements, we can conclude that the resulting set is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U"
