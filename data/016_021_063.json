    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is generated by repeatedly applying a specific set of rules to an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the number of line segments increases. To find the total number of line segments after the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (2^n - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (2^5 - 1)\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (32 - 1)\nNumber of line segments = 3 * 31\nNumber of line segments = 93\n\nSo, after the 5th iteration, there are 93 line segments in the Sierpinski arrowhead curve."
