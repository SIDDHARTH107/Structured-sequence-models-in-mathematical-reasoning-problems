Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (A) to 0 and the distances of all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (A) and mark it as visited.\n3. Update the distances of its neighbors (B and E) by adding the edge weight to the current distance of the node.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (H) is visited.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1.
