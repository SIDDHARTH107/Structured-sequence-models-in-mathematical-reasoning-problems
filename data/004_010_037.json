    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 5x^4 - 3x^2 + 2x, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n, where n is a constant, is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nAntiderivative of 5x^4: (5x^(4+1))/(4+1) = (5x^5)/5 = x^5\nAntiderivative of -3x^2: (-3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (-3x^3)/3 = -x^3\nAntiderivative of 2x: (2x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (2x^2)/2 = x^2\n\nNow, we add the antiderivatives of each term and include the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^5 - x^3 + x^2 + C"
