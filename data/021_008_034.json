    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to a system of nonlinear equations, we need to find the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. The Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nFor the given system of equations, we have:\n\nf1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 8\nf2(x, y) = x^2 - xy + y^2 - 3\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = 2y\n∂f2/∂x = 2x - y\n∂f2/∂y = -x + 2y\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = |  2x   2y  |\n          | 2x-y  -x+2y |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the inverse is given by:\n\nJ^(-1)(x, y) = (1/det(J)) * |  d  -b  |\n                             | -c   a  |\n\nwhere det(J) = ad - bc.\n\nFor our Jacobian matrix, a = 2x, b = 2y, c = 2x - y, and d = -x + 2y. The determinant is:\n\ndet(J) = (2x)(-x + 2y) - (2y)(2x - y) = -2x^2 + 4xy - 4xy + 2y^2 = -2x^2 + 2y^2\n\nSo, the inverse Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ^(-1)(x, y) = (1/(-2x^2 + 2y^2)) * | -x+2y  -2y  |\n                                     |  y-2x   2x  |\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method using the initial approximation (1,1):\n\n1. Compute the function values at the initial approximation:\n\nf1(1, 1) = 1^2 + 1^2 - 8 = -6\nf2(1, 1) = 1^2 - 1*1 + 1^2 - 3 = -1\n\n2. Compute the inverse Jacobian matrix at the initial approximation:\n\nJ^(-1)(1, 1) = (1/(-2 + 2)) * | 1  -2 |\n                               | -1  2 |\n\nSince the determinant is 0, we cannot find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix at this point. Therefore, we need to choose a different initial approximation. Let's try (1.1, 1.1):\n\n1. Compute the function values at the new initial approximation:\n\nf1(1.1, 1.1) = 1.1^2 + 1.1^2 - 8 = -5.58\nf2(1.1, 1.1) = 1.1^2 - 1.1*1.1 + 1.1^2 - 3 = -0.89\n\n2. Compute the inverse Jacobian matrix at the new initial approximation:\n\nJ^(-1)(1.1, 1.1) = (1/(-2*1.1^2 + 2*1.1^2)) * | -1.1+2*1.1  -2*1.1 |\n                                             |  1.1-2*1.1    2*1.1  |\n\nJ^(-1)(1.1, 1.1) = (1/(-0.22)) * | 1.1  -2.2 |\n                                   | -1.1  2.2 |\n\nJ^(-1)(1.1, 1.1) = | -5  10 |\n                   |  5 -10 |\n\n3. Compute the next approximation:\n\n(x2, y2) = (1.1, 1.1) - J^(-1)(1.1, 1.1) * (f1(1.1, 1.1), f2(1.1, 1.1))\n\n(x2, y2) = (1.1, 1.1) - (-5 * -5.58 + 10 * -0.89, 5 * -5.58 - 10 * -0.89)\n(x2, y2) = (1.1, 1.1) - (-27.9, 13.9)\n(x2, y2) = (28.9, -12.8)\n\nNow, we can continue iterating using Newton's method until the desired accuracy is reached. However, it's important to note that Newton's method is sensitive to the initial approximation and may not always converge to the correct solution. In this case, it's recommended to try different initial approximations or use other numerical methods to find the roots of the system."
