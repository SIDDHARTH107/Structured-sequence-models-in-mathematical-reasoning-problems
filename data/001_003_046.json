    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\n2x - 3y = 5\n\n2x = 3y + 5\n\nx = (3y + 5)/2\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n5x + 4y = 38\n\n5((3y + 5)/2) + 4y = 38\n\n(15y + 25)/2 + 4y = 38\n\nNow, we will multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n15y + 25 + 8y = 76\n\nNow, we will combine like terms:\n\n23y + 25 = 76\n\nNow, we will subtract 25 from both sides:\n\n23y = 51\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by 23:\n\ny = 51/23\n\ny = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we will substitute it back into the expression for x:\n\nx = (3y + 5)/2\n\nx = (3(3) + 5)/2\n\nx = (9 + 5)/2\n\nx = 14/2\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, the values of x and y are x = 7 and y = 3."
