    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of producing a rectangular sheet of metal with a length of 10 cm and a width of 15 cm. The sheet needs to have an area of 100 cm². The company has a machine that can make cuts of up to 1 cm in length. Each cut costs $0.50. \n\nUsing tabu search, what is the minimum cost the company can achieve if they need to make 5 cuts to produce the required sheet?",
    "message_2": "To achieve an area of 100 cm² with a rectangular sheet of metal, the dimensions must be 10 cm x 10 cm. The initial sheet is 10 cm x 15 cm. Therefore, the company needs to cut 5 cm from the width of the sheet to achieve the desired dimensions.\n\nSince the machine can make cuts of up to 1 cm in length, the company needs to make 5 cuts (5 cm / 1 cm per cut) to reduce the width from 15 cm to 10 cm. Each cut costs $0.50, so the total cost of making the 5 cuts is:\n\n5 cuts * $0.50 per cut = $2.50\n\nUsing tabu search, the minimum cost the company can achieve to produce the required sheet with 5 cuts is $2.50."
