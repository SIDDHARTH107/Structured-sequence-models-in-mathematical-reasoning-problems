    "message_1": "In a dataset of 50 students who have taken 5 exams in a semester, the mean score of the first exam is 68, and the standard deviation is 8. The mean score of the second exam is 73, and the standard deviation is 6. The mean score of the third exam is 60, and the standard deviation is 10. The mean score of the fourth exam is 77, and the standard deviation is 5. The mean score of the fifth exam is 85, and the standard deviation is 4. Using principal component analysis, find the total variability explained by the first two components.",
    "message_2": "To find the total variability explained by the first two components using principal component analysis (PCA), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the covariance matrix of the dataset.\n2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n3. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and choose the first two largest eigenvalues.\n4. Calculate the proportion of the total variability explained by the first two components.\n\nHowever, we do not have the actual dataset of 50 students' scores on the 5 exams. We only have the mean and standard deviation for each exam. Without the actual dataset, we cannot perform PCA and find the total variability explained by the first two components.\n\nTo perform PCA, we would need the raw data of the 50 students' scores on each of the 5 exams."
