    "message_1": "A toy company wants to produce two types of toys: trains and planes. The company can produce each train for $5 and sell it for $10, and can produce each plane for $10 and sell it for $15. However, the company's production capacity is limited to 50 units and the number of planes produced must be no more than double the number of trains produced. What is the optimal production plan that maximizes the profit of the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of trains produced and y be the number of planes produced.\n\nThe profit for each train is $10 - $5 = $5, and the profit for each plane is $15 - $10 = $5.\n\nThe company's production capacity constraint is x + y ≤ 50.\n\nThe constraint for the number of planes produced being no more than double the number of trains produced is y ≤ 2x.\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 5y, subject to the constraints x + y ≤ 50 and y ≤ 2x.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the profit function by dividing by 5: P(x, y) = x + y.\n\nNow, we can analyze the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 50\n2. y ≤ 2x\n\nWe can rewrite the first constraint as y ≤ 50 - x.\n\nNow, we can graph the feasible region determined by these constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ 50 - x\n2. y ≤ 2x\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 50), and (25, 25).\n\nSince the profit function P(x, y) = x + y is linear, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nVertex (0, 0): P(0, 0) = 0 + 0 = 0\nVertex (0, 50): P(0, 50) = 0 + 50 = 50\nVertex (25, 25): P(25, 25) = 25 + 25 = 50\n\nThe maximum profit is $50, which occurs at two vertices: (0, 50) and (25, 25).\n\nSo, there are two optimal production plans that maximize the profit of the company:\n\n1. Produce 0 trains and 50 planes, resulting in a profit of $50 * $5 = $250.\n2. Produce 25 trains and 25 planes, resulting in a profit of $50 * $5 = $250."
