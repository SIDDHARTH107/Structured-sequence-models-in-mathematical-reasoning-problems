    "message_2": "To find the 15th term of the sequence, we will continue the pattern of adding the previous two terms to get the next term. The given sequence starts with 1, 3, and 5. Let's continue the sequence:\n\n4th term: 3 + 5 = 8\n5th term: 5 + 8 = 13\n6th term: 8 + 13 = 21\n7th term: 13 + 21 = 34\n8th term: 21 + 34 = 55\n9th term: 34 + 55 = 89\n10th term: 55 + 89 = 144\n11th term: 89 + 144 = 233\n12th term: 144 + 233 = 377\n13th term: 233 + 377 = 610\n14th term: 377 + 610 = 987\n15th term: 610 + 987 = 1597\n\nSo, the 15th term of the sequence is 1597."
