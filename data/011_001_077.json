    "message_1": "In a class of 30 students, the teacher wants to choose a group of 5 for a project. How many different groups of 5 students can be formed from the class?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different groups of 5 students that can be formed from a class of 30 students, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (30 in this case), k is the number of students in each group (5 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5!(30-5)!)\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5!25!)\n\nC(30, 5) = (30 × 29 × 28 × 27 × 26) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(30, 5) = 142506\n\nTherefore, there are 142,506 different groups of 5 students that can be formed from a class of 30 students."
