    "message_2": "In modal logic, we typically deal with propositions and their truth values, rather than sets and relations between their elements. However, we can still solve the problem of finding the number of possible relations from X to Y using combinatorial methods.\n\nA relation from set X to set Y can be represented as a subset of the Cartesian product X × Y. The Cartesian product X × Y contains all possible ordered pairs (x, y) where x ∈ X and y ∈ Y. Since X has 7 elements and Y has 10 elements, the Cartesian product X × Y has 7 × 10 = 70 elements.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of possible subsets of X × Y. Each element in X × Y can either be included or not included in a subset, so there are 2 choices for each of the 70 elements. Therefore, there are 2^70 possible subsets of X × Y, and thus 2^70 possible relations from X to Y."
