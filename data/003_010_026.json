    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the height of the tree is the side opposite the angle, and the length of the shadow is the side adjacent to the angle. So, we have:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(angle) = 20 / 25\ntan(angle) = 0.8\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse tangent (arctangent) of 0.8 to get the angle:\n\nangle = arctan(0.8)\nangle â‰ˆ 38.66 degrees\n\nRounding to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation is approximately 39 degrees."
