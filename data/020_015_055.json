A fence along the side of the gardens parallel to the two 30 meter sides is to be constructed using 150 meters of fencing material. Find the dimensions of the enclosure that will maximize the enclosed area.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the fence parallel to the 30-meter sides as x, and the length of the fence perpendicular to the 30-meter sides as y. Since the fence is to be constructed using 150 meters of fencing material, we have the following equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 150\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that will maximize the enclosed area. The area of the enclosure can be represented as:\n\nArea = x * (2 * 30 + y)\n\nWe want to maximize this area, so we need to express y in terms of x using the equation 2x + 3y = 150:\n\ny = (150 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the area equation:\n\nArea = x * (60 + (150 - 2x) / 3)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nArea = x * (60 + 50 - (2/3)x)\n\nArea = x * (110 - (2/3)x)\n\nNow, to find the maximum area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the area equation with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dx = 110 - (4/3)x = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\n(4/3)x = 110\n\nx = (3/4) * 110\nx = 82.5\n\nNow, find the value of y using the equation y = (150 - 2x) / 3:\n\ny = (150 - 2 * 82.5) / 3\ny = (150 - 165) / 3\ny = -15 / 3\ny = -5\n\nSince the value of y cannot be negative, there is no maximum area for the given problem. The dimensions of the enclosure cannot be determined with the given constraints."
