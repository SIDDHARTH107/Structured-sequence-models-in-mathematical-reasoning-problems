    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 4sin(2x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's first find the derivative of f(x) = 4sin(2x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [4sin(2x)]\n\nThe outer function is 4sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is:\n\nd(4sin(u))/du = 4cos(u)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\n\nd(2x)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = (4cos(u)) * (2) = 8cos(2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\nf'(π/6) = 8cos(2(π/6)) = 8cos(π/3)\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2, so:\n\nf'(π/6) = 8(1/2) = 4\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) = 4sin(2x) at x = π/6 is 4."
