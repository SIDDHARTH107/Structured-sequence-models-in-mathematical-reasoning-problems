    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\naverage value = (1/(b - a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 2sin(x) + 3cos(x), and the interval is [0, π/2]. So, a = 0 and b = π/2.\n\naverage value = (1/(π/2 - 0)) * ∫[0, π/2] (2sin(x) + 3cos(x)) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of the function:\n\n∫(2sin(x) + 3cos(x)) dx = -2cos(x) + 3sin(x) + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral on the interval [0, π/2]:\n\n(-2cos(π/2) + 3sin(π/2)) - (-2cos(0) + 3sin(0)) = (-2(0) + 3(1)) - (-2(1) + 3(0)) = 3 - (-2) = 5\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\naverage value = (1/(π/2)) * 5 = 10/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) + 3cos(x) on the interval [0, π/2] is 10/π."
