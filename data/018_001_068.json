    "message_2": "The cardinality of the empty set is 0. \n\nProof: \nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. By definition, the empty set (denoted as âˆ…) has no elements. Therefore, the cardinality of the empty set is 0.\n\nNow, let's show that the empty set is a subset of every set.\n\nLet A be any arbitrary set. A subset B of set A is defined as a set such that every element of B is also an element of A. Since the empty set has no elements, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A. Thus, the empty set is a subset of A.\n\nSince A was an arbitrary set, this implies that the empty set is a subset of every set."
