    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16. If n_2 = 3, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16, and they are not normal.\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. If n_3 = 4, then there are four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3, and they are not normal.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If both n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since they are both normal, their product forms a group of order 48. This gives us the direct product of the two subgroups, which is isomorphic to Z_16 x Z_3 (where Z_n denotes the cyclic group of order n). This is one non-isomorphic group of order 48.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, we can form a semidirect product between the unique Sylow 2-subgroup and one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. This gives us two non-isomorphic groups: Z_48 and Z_16 x Z_3 ⋊ Z_2 (where ⋊ denotes the semidirect product).\n\n3. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, we can form a semidirect product between one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and the unique Sylow 3-subgroup. This gives us two non-isomorphic groups: Z_8 x (Z_2 x Z_3) and Z_4 x (Z_4 x Z_3).\n\n4. If both n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, we cannot form a direct or semidirect product, as there is no normal subgroup.\n\nIn total, we have found 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. Z_16 x Z_3\n2. Z_48\n3. Z_16 x Z_3 ⋊ Z_2\n4. Z_8 x (Z_2 x Z_3)\n5. Z_4 x (Z_4 x Z_3)"
