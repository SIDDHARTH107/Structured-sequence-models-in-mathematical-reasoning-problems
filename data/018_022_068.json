    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted by A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, which is denoted by B △ A.\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 3, 4, 1} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nAs we can see, A △ B = B △ A = {1, 4}. The symmetric difference is commutative.\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and (B △ A):\n\n(A △ B) × (B △ A) = {1, 4} × {1, 4} = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of (B △ A) and (A △ B):\n\n(B △ A) × (A △ B) = {1, 4} × {1, 4} = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) × (B △ A) = (B △ A) × (A △ B). Therefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
