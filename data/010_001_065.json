    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of open sets that a subspace Y of X can have, we need to consider the open sets in X and their intersections with Y.\n\nLet's denote the open sets in X as {O1, O2, ..., O13}. For each open set Oi in X, the intersection Oi ∩ Y is an open set in the subspace topology on Y. Note that some of these intersections might be empty, and the empty set is also considered an open set in a topological space.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario, where all the intersections Oi ∩ Y are distinct and non-empty. In this case, Y would have one open set for each intersection, plus the empty set and Y itself (which are always open sets in any topological space).\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, Y can have at most 13 (intersections) + 1 (empty set) + 1 (Y itself) = 15 open sets."
