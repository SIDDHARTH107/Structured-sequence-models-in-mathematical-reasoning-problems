    "message_2": "To compute the Lyapunov exponent of the Ikeda map, we first need to calculate the Jacobian matrix of the map, which is given by the partial derivatives of the map with respect to x_n and y_n:\n\nJ(x_n, y_n) = [[∂x_{n+1}/∂x_n, ∂x_{n+1}/∂y_n], [∂y_{n+1}/∂x_n, ∂y_{n+1}/∂y_n]]\n\nTaking the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x_n, y_n) = [[a*cos(t_n), -a*sin(t_n)], [b*sin(t_n), b*cos(t_n)]]\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is calculated by averaging the logarithm of the absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix over a large number of iterations. Let's compute the Lyapunov exponent for the first 10000 iterations:\n\n1. Initialize x_0 = y_0 = 1, t_0 = 0, a = 0.9, b = 0.4, and sum_det = 0.\n2. For n = 0 to 9999, do the following:\n   a. Compute t_n = 0.4 - 6 / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2)\n   b. Compute the Jacobian matrix J(x_n, y_n)\n   c. Calculate the determinant of J(x_n, y_n) and add the logarithm of its absolute value to sum_det\n   d. Update x_n and y_n using the Ikeda map equations\n3. Compute the Lyapunov exponent as (1/10000) * sum_det\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we obtain the Lyapunov exponent for the Ikeda map with the given parameters and initial conditions for the first 10000 iterations."
