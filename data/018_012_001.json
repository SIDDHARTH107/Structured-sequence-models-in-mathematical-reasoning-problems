    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of the two sets A and B:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A × B) with B:\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = Ø (the empty set)\n\nThis is because none of the elements in A × B are elements of B.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A:\n\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (B × A) with B:\n\n(B × A) ∩ B = Ø (the empty set)\n\nThis is because none of the elements in B × A are elements of B.\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets we found:\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = Ø\n(B × A) ∩ B = Ø\n\nSince both sets are equal to the empty set, they are equal to each other.\n\nHowever, this does not show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection, as the problem statement suggests. The problem statement is incorrect. The Cartesian product is not associative in general, but the intersection operation is associative. The question seems to be mixing up the two concepts."
