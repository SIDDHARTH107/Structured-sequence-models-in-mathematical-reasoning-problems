The first and second integrals require integration by parts, and the third integral is a standard Fourier transform of a constant function.\n\n1) ∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = e^(-2πikx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = -1/(2πik) * e^(-2πikx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\n∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx = -x^2 * e^(-2πikx) / (2πik) - ∫[-2x * e^(-2πikx) / (2πik)] dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second term again by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = e^(-2πikx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -1/(2πik) * e^(-2πikx)\n\n∫[-2x * e^(-2πikx) / (2πik)] dx = -2x * e^(-2πikx) / (4π^2k^2) + ∫[2 * e^(-2πikx) / (4π^2k^2)] dx\n\nCombining the results:\n\n∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx = -x^2 * e^(-2πikx) / (2πik) - 2x * e^(-2πikx) / (4π^2k^2) + e^(-2πikx) / (4π^3k^3)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from -∞ to ∞, but it doesn't converge, so the Fourier transform doesn't exist for this term.\n\n2) ∫[x * e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\nWe already computed this integral in the previous step:\n\n∫[x * e^(-2πikx)] dx = -x * e^(-2πikx) / (2πik) + e^(-2πikx) / (4π^2k^2)\n\nThis integral also doesn't converge from -∞ to ∞, so the Fourier transform doesn't exist for this term.\n\n3) ∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\n∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx = -1/(2πik) * e^(-2πikx)\n\nThis integral also doesn't converge from -∞ to ∞.\n\nSince none of the three integrals converge, the Fourier transform of f(x) = x^2 - x + 1 doesn't exist."
