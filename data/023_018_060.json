    "message_2": "To find the steady-state error of the system's output when the input signal is a sine wave with frequency 2 rad/s, we first need to find the frequency response of the system. The frequency response is the transfer function evaluated at s = jω, where ω is the frequency in radians per second and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe input signal is a sine wave with frequency 2 rad/s, so we have ω = 2. Now, we'll substitute s = jω into the transfer function G(s):\n\nG(jω) = (jω + 3) / ( (jω)^3 + 5(jω)^2 + 7(jω) + 3)\n\nG(j2) = (j2 + 3) / ( (j2)^3 + 5(j2)^2 + 7(j2) + 3)\n\nNow, we'll simplify the expression:\n\nG(j2) = (j2 + 3) / ( -8j + 20 - 14j + 3)\n\nG(j2) = (j2 + 3) / (23 - 22j)\n\nNow, we'll find the magnitude of G(j2):\n\n|G(j2)| = |(j2 + 3) / (23 - 22j)|\n\nTo find the magnitude, we can use the formula |a + bj| = √(a^2 + b^2):\n\n|G(j2)| = √((2^2 + 3^2) / (23^2 + (-22)^2))\n|G(j2)| = √(13 / (23^2 + 22^2))\n|G(j2)| ≈ 0.267\n\nNow, we'll find the steady-state error of the system's output. The steady-state error is given by the formula:\n\nSteady-state error = (1 - |G(jω)|) * Input amplitude\n\nAssuming the input sine wave has an amplitude of 1:\n\nSteady-state error = (1 - 0.267) * 1\nSteady-state error ≈ 0.733\n\nSo, the steady-state error of the system's output when the input signal is a sine wave with frequency 2 rad/s is approximately 0.733."
