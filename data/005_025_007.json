    "message_1": "A company produces bags of popcorn, and the weights are supposed to be 5 ounces per bag. A sample of 50 bags was taken, and their mean weight was calculated to be 4.8 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.4 ounces. Can we infer that the mean weight of all bags produced by the company is below 5 ounces with a 95% confidence level?",
    "message_2": "To determine if we can infer that the mean weight of all bags produced by the company is below 5 ounces with a 95% confidence level, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean weight of the bags is equal to 5 ounces (µ = 5). The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean weight of the bags is less than 5 ounces (µ < 5).\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 4.8 ounces\nSample standard deviation (s) = 0.4 ounces\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - µ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (4.8 - 5) / (0.4 / √50)\nt = (-0.2) / (0.4 / 7.071)\nt = -0.2 / 0.0566\nt ≈ -3.53\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a 95% confidence level (one-tailed) and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 49). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.677.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.53) is less than the critical t-value (-1.677), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the mean weight of all bags produced by the company is below 5 ounces with a 95% confidence level."
