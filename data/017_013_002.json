Semidirect product of C_9 and C_2, denoted as C_9 ⋊ C_2\n\nLet's discuss each case in detail:\n\n1. Cyclic group C_18:\n\nA cyclic group of order 18 is generated by a single element, say g, such that g^18 = e (identity element), and all the other elements of the group are powers of g. This group is abelian, and its elements can be represented as {e, g, g^2, ..., g^17}. The isomorphism can be proven by showing that the group operation (multiplication) satisfies the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverse).\n\nExample: Consider the group of integers modulo 18 under addition, denoted as Z_18. This group is cyclic and generated by the element 1. The elements of the group are {0, 1, 2, ..., 17}, and the group operation is addition modulo 18.\n\n2. Direct product of C_9 and C_2 (C_9 × C_2):\n\nThe direct product of two groups C_9 and C_2 can be formed by taking the Cartesian product of their elements and defining the group operation component-wise. The elements of C_9 × C_2 can be represented as {(a, b) | a ∈ C_9, b ∈ C_2}. This group is also abelian.\n\nExample: Consider the groups C_9 = {1, g, g^2, ..., g^8} and C_2 = {1, h}, where g^9 = h^2 = 1 and gh = hg. The direct product C_9 × C_2 has elements {(1, 1), (g, 1), (g^2, 1), ..., (g^8, 1), (1, h), (g, h), (g^2, h), ..., (g^8, h)}. The group operation is defined as (a, b)(c, d) = (ac, bd).\n\n3. Semidirect product of C_9 and C_2 (C_9 ⋊ C_2):\n\nThe semidirect product of C_9 and C_2 is a non-abelian group. It can be formed by defining a group operation that combines the group actions of C_9 and C_2, along with an additional action of C_2 on C_9. Let φ: C_2 → Aut(C_9) be a homomorphism that defines the action of C_2 on C_9. The elements of C_9 ⋊ C_2 can be represented as {(a, b) | a ∈ C_9, b ∈ C_2}, similar to the direct product case. However, the group operation is now defined as (a, b)(c, d) = (a * φ_b(c), bd), where φ_b(c) represents the action of b ∈ C_2 on c ∈ C_9.\n\nExample: Consider the groups C_9 = {1, g, g^2, ..., g^8} and C_2 = {1, h}, where g^9 = h^2 = 1. Define the action of h on C_9 as φ_h(g^k) = g^(8k) for k = 0, 1, ..., 8. The semidirect product C_9 ⋊ C_2 has elements {(1, 1), (g, 1), (g^2, 1), ..., (g^8, 1), (1, h), (g, h), (g^2, h), ..., (g^8, h)}. The group operation is defined as (a, b)(c, d) = (a * φ_b(c), bd), which results in a non-abelian group structure.\n\nIn summary, a group of order 18 can be isomorphic to a cyclic group C_18, a direct product of C_9 and C_2 (C_9 × C_2), or a semidirect product of C_9 and C_2 (C_9 ⋊ C_2). Each case can be proven by constructing examples and verifying the group axioms."
