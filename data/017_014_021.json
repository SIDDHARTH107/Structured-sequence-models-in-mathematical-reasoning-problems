    "message_2": "Let's consider a non-abelian group of order 20. One example is the semidirect product of Z_5 and Z_4, denoted as Z_5 ⋊ Z_4. This group has the following presentation:\n\nG = ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^2⟩\n\nHere, a has order 5, b has order 4, and the conjugation action of b on a is given by b^(-1)ab = a^2. This group is non-abelian since the elements a and b do not commute.\n\nNow let's find the center of G. The center of a group is the set of elements that commute with all other elements in the group. In this case, we can see that the element a does not commute with b, so a is not in the center. Similarly, b does not commute with a, so b is not in the center either. The only element that commutes with all other elements in G is the identity element, 1. Therefore, the center of G is Z(G) = {1}.\n\nNext, let's find all the normal subgroups of G. A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by elements of the group. We know that G has subgroups of orders 1, 4, 5, and 20 (by Lagrange's theorem). The subgroups of order 1 and 20 are always normal, so we have:\n\n1. {1} (trivial subgroup)\n2. G itself\n\nThe subgroup of order 5 is generated by a, so we have:\n\n3. ⟨a⟩ = {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4}\n\nSince the index of this subgroup in G is 4, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, this subgroup is normal by the normalizer-centralizer theorem.\n\nThe subgroup of order 4 is generated by b, so we have:\n\n4. ⟨b⟩ = {1, b, b^2, b^3}\n\nHowever, this subgroup is not normal in G, as conjugation by a does not preserve the subgroup:\n\na^(-1)ba = a^(-1)(a^2) = a^3 ≠ b\n\nThus, the normal subgroups of G are:\n\n1. {1}\n2. G itself\n3. ⟨a⟩ = {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4}"
