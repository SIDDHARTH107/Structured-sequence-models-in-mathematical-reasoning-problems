    "message_2": "To find the number of common points of the two algebraic curves in the projective plane P² over an algebraically closed field F, we will use Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves in a projective plane is equal to the product of their degrees, counting multiplicities and assuming that the field is algebraically closed.\n\nFirst, let's find the degrees of the given curves:\n\n1. x² + y² = 25: This is a circle with radius 5 in the affine plane. To find its degree, we look at the highest power of any variable in the equation, which is 2. Therefore, the degree of this curve is 2.\n\n2. x + y + z = 0: This is a line in the projective plane. The highest power of any variable in the equation is 1. Therefore, the degree of this curve is 1.\n\nNow, we apply Bézout's theorem: the number of intersection points is equal to the product of the degrees of the curves, which is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nSo, there are 2 common points of the given algebraic curves in the projective plane P² over an algebraically closed field F."
