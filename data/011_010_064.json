    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. The first term can be any of the 3 numbers: 0, 1, or 2. So, there are 3 choices for the first term.\n\n2. The second term can be any of the 2 remaining numbers (not equal to the first term). So, there are 2 choices for the second term.\n\n3. The third term can be any of the 2 remaining numbers (not equal to the second term). So, there are 2 choices for the third term.\n\n4. The fourth term can be any of the 2 remaining numbers (not equal to the third term). So, there are 2 choices for the fourth term.\n\n5. The fifth term can be any of the 2 remaining numbers (not equal to the fourth term). So, there are 2 choices for the fifth term.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of choices for each term to get the total number of ways to arrange the sequence:\n\n3 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 48 ways."
