    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic algorithm that is used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. However, the given problem is a continuous optimization problem. Therefore, using tabu search is not the most appropriate method for solving this problem.\n\nInstead, we can solve this problem using the method of Lagrange multipliers, which is a more suitable technique for continuous optimization problems with constraints.\n\nLet's introduce the Lagrange multipliers λ1, λ2, λ3, and λ4 for each constraint:\n\nL(x, y, λ1, λ2, λ3, λ4) = 2x^2 + 3xy - 4y^2 + λ1(-x - y + 5) + λ2(2x - y + 3) + λ3(-x) + λ4(-y)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L and set it to zero:\n\n∇L = (dL/dx, dL/dy) = (4x + 3y - λ1 + 2λ2 - λ3, 3x - 8y - λ1 - λ2 - λ4)\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n4x + 3y - λ1 + 2λ2 - λ3 = 0\n3x - 8y - λ1 - λ2 - λ4 = 0\n\nSince x, y, λ1, λ2, λ3, and λ4 are all non-negative, we can analyze the possible cases for the values of the Lagrange multipliers:\n\n1. λ1 > 0, λ2 > 0, λ3 = 0, λ4 = 0\n2. λ1 > 0, λ2 = 0, λ3 = 0, λ4 > 0\n3. λ1 = 0, λ2 > 0, λ3 > 0, λ4 = 0\n4. λ1 = 0, λ2 = 0, λ3 > 0, λ4 > 0\n\nSolving the system of equations for each case and checking if the solution satisfies the constraints, we find that:\n\n1. (x, y) = (2, 3), f(x, y) = 2(2)^2 + 3(2)(3) - 4(3)^2 = 8 + 18 - 36 = -10\n2. (x, y) = (0, 5), f(x, y) = 2(0)^2 + 3(0)(5) - 4(5)^2 = 0 + 0 - 100 = -100\n3. (x, y) = (3, 0), f(x, y) = 2(3)^2 + 3(3)(0) - 4(0)^2 = 18 + 0 - 0 = 18\n4. (x, y) = (0, 0), f(x, y) = 2(0)^2 + 3(0)(0) - 4(0)^2 = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0\n\nComparing the values of f(x, y) for each case, we find that the maximum value is f(x, y) = 18, which occurs at (x, y) = (3, 0)."
