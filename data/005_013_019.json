    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between height and weight for this sample, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of height (X) and weight (Y).\n2. Calculate the deviations of each height and weight value from their respective means.\n3. Multiply the deviations of each pair of height and weight values.\n4. Calculate the sum of these products.\n5. Calculate the sum of squared deviations for height and weight.\n6. Divide the sum of products (step 4) by the square root of the product of the sum of squared deviations for height and weight (step 5).\n7. The result is the correlation coefficient (r).\n\nHowever, we do not have the complete dataset for the 50 individuals. Please provide the full dataset to calculate the correlation coefficient."
