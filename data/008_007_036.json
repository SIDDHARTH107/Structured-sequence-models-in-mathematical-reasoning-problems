    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[4, 1, -2]\n[1, 5, 1]\n[-2, 1, 4]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI:\n[4-λ, 1, -2]\n[1, 5-λ, 1]\n[-2, 1, 4-λ]\n\nComputing the determinant:\n(4-λ)[(5-λ)(4-λ) - 1] - 1[-2(4-λ) - 1] - 2[-2 + (5-λ)] = 0\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\nλ^3 - 13λ^2 + 49λ - 36 = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 2, λ2 = 6, and λ3 = 5.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow we need to find the eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n[2, 1, -2]\n[1, 3, 1]\n[-2, 1, 2]\nThe eigenvector is v1 = [1, 1, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 6:\n[-2, 1, -2]\n[1, -1, 1]\n[-2, 1, -2]\nThe eigenvector is v2 = [1, 0, -1].\n\nFor λ3 = 5:\n[-1, 1, -2]\n[1, 0, 1]\n[-2, 1, -1]\nThe eigenvector is v3 = [2, 1, 1].\n\n3. Form the matrices P and D:\nNow we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D using the eigenvalues as diagonal entries.\n\nMatrix P:\n[1, 1, 2]\n[1, 0, 1]\n[1, -1, 1]\n\nMatrix D:\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nNow we have A = PDP^(-1)."
