    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to minimize the total cost of producing a certain quantity of units. The cost depends on the random price of raw material, which follows a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 2. The fixed cost of production is $100 and the variable cost per unit is $8. How many units should the manufacturer produce to minimize the total cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total cost, we need to find the optimal number of units to produce. Let x be the number of units produced. The total cost function can be represented as:\n\nTotal Cost = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per Unit + Cost of Raw Material per Unit) * Number of Units\n\nSince the cost of raw material per unit follows a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2, we can represent the cost of raw material per unit as N(10, 2).\n\nThe total cost function becomes:\n\nTotal Cost = 100 + (8 + N(10, 2)) * x\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the derivative of the total cost function with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Total Cost)/dx = 0\n\nSince the cost of raw material per unit is a random variable, we cannot directly differentiate the total cost function. However, we can minimize the expected total cost by minimizing the expected cost per unit.\n\nExpected Cost per Unit = Variable Cost per Unit + Expected Cost of Raw Material per Unit\n\nSince the expected value of a normal distribution is equal to its mean, the expected cost of raw material per unit is 10. Therefore, the expected cost per unit is:\n\nExpected Cost per Unit = 8 + 10 = 18\n\nNow, we can rewrite the total cost function using the expected cost per unit:\n\nTotal Cost = 100 + 18 * x\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we differentiate the total cost function with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Total Cost)/dx = 18 = 0\n\nHowever, this equation has no solution, as the derivative is a constant and does not equal zero. This indicates that the total cost function is a linear function with a positive slope, and the total cost will keep increasing as the number of units produced increases.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer should produce as few units as possible to minimize the total cost. If the manufacturer needs to produce a certain quantity of units, they should produce exactly that quantity, as producing more units will only increase the total cost."
