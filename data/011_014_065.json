    "message_2": "Let's use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have:\n\n6 vertices of degree 2: 6 * 2 = 12\n2 vertices of degree 3: 2 * 3 = 6\n\nSum of degrees: 12 + 6 = 18\n\nNow, we know that the sum of the degrees is equal to twice the number of edges, so:\n\n18 = 2 * number of edges\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nnumber of edges = 18 / 2 = 9\n\nSo, the graph G has 9 edges."
