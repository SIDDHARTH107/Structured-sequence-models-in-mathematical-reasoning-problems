    "message_1": "A particle moves along the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4. Determine the length of the curve traveled by the particle.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve traveled by the particle, we can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x) over the interval [a, b]:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x^(3/2):\n\nf(x) = x^(3/2)\nf'(x) = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nSimplify the expression inside the square root:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral using substitution method. Let u = 1 + (9/4)x, then du/dx = 9/4, and dx = (4/9)du:\n\nL = ∫[u(1), u(4)] √(u) (4/9) du\n\nNow we need to find the new limits of integration by plugging in x = 1 and x = 4 into the expression for u:\n\nu(1) = 1 + (9/4)(1) = 1 + 9/4 = 13/4\nu(4) = 1 + (9/4)(4) = 1 + 9 = 10\n\nNow we can rewrite the integral with the new limits of integration:\n\nL = (4/9) ∫[13/4, 10] √(u) du\n\nNow we can evaluate the integral:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [13/4, 10]\nL = (8/27) * (u^(3/2)) | [13/4, 10]\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - (13/4)^(3/2))\nL = (8/27) * (10√10 - 13√(13/4))\nL ≈ 7.523\n\nTherefore, the length of the curve traveled by the particle is approximately 7.523 units."
