    "message_1": "A car travels at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour. If it takes 4 hours to travel from Town A to Town B, how far apart are the two towns?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between Town A and Town B, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 50 miles per hour, and the time is 4 hours. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDistance = 50 miles/hour × 4 hours\n\nDistance = 200 miles\n\nTherefore, Town A and Town B are 200 miles apart."
