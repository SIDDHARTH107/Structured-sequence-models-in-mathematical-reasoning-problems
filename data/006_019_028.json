    "message_1": "In a certain country, there are 4 major political parties â€“ Party A, Party B, Party C, and Party D. If the probability of Party A winning the election is 0.5, the probability of Party B winning the election is 0.3, the probability of Party C winning the election is 0.15, and the probability of Party D winning the election is 0.05, what is the probability that either Party A or Party C will win the election?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that either Party A or Party C will win the election, we simply add their individual probabilities together:\n\nP(A or C) = P(A) + P(C)\n\nP(A or C) = 0.5 (Party A) + 0.15 (Party C)\n\nP(A or C) = 0.65\n\nTherefore, the probability that either Party A or Party C will win the election is 0.65 or 65%."
