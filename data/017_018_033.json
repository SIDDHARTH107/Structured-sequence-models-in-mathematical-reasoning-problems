    "message_2": "There are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. The order of a group is the number of its elements. Since 32 = 2^5, we are looking for groups of order 2^5. These groups can be classified using their group structures, which are determined by the number of cyclic factors in their decomposition.\n\nThe group structures of the 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32 are as follows:\n\n1. C_32 (Cyclic group of order 32)\n2. C_16 x C_2\n3. C_8 x C_4\n4. C_8 x C_2 x C_2\n5. C_4 x C_4 x C_2\n6. C_4 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2\n7. C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 (Elementary abelian group of order 32)\n\n8-10. Three groups with structure C_4 x C_4 x C_2, but with different actions.\n11-15. Five groups with structure C_8 x C_2 x C_2, but with different actions.\n16-30. Fifteen groups with structure C_4 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2, but with different actions.\n31-51. Twenty-one groups with structure C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2, but with different actions.\n\nThese groups can be further studied using their presentations, automorphism groups, and other algebraic properties."
