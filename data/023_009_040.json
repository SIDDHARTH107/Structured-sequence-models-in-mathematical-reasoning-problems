    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by kX(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = X''(x)/X(x) = -λ\n\nHere, λ is the separation constant. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nT'(t) + kλT(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(20,t) = 0:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) = 0 => A = 0\nX(20) = B*sin(√λ*20) = 0\n\nSince B is not zero, we have:\n\nsin(√λ*20) = 0 => √λ*20 = nπ => λ = (nπ/20)^2, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, solving the second equation, we get:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-kλt)\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/20) * exp(-(nπ/20)^2 * k * t)]\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients B_n using the initial condition u(x,0) = x(20-x):\n\nx(20-x) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/20)]\n\nWe can find B_n using the Fourier sine series:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[x(20-x) * sin(nπx/20) dx] from 0 to 20\n\nHere, L = 20. So,\n\nB_n = (1/10) * ∫[x(20-x) * sin(nπx/20) dx] from 0 to 20\n\nIntegrating by parts twice, we get:\n\nB_n = (1600/((nπ)^3)) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) for odd n\nB_n = 0 for even n\n\nNow, we have the solution:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [((1600/((nπ)^3)) * (-1)^((n-1)/2)) * sin(nπx/20) * exp(-(nπ/20)^2 * k * t)] for odd n\n\nFinally, we can find the value of u(4,10):\n\nu(4,10) = Σ [((1600/((nπ)^3)) * (-1)^((n-1)/2)) * sin(nπ*4/20) * exp(-(nπ/20)^2 * 0.025 * 10)] for odd n\n\nTo get an approximate value, we can sum the first few terms of the series:\n\nu(4,10) ≈ (1600/(π^3)) * (sin(π*4/20) * exp(-(π/20)^2 * 0.025 * 10) - (1/27) * sin(3π*4/20) * exp(-(3π/20)^2 * 0.025 * 10) + ...)\n\nu(4,10) ≈ 29.93\n\nSo, the temperature at the point x=4 cm and time t=10 seconds is approximately 29.93°C."
