    "message_1": "A company's product has a success rate of 87%. A customer has ordered 10 units of the product. What is the probability that at least 8 of the units will be successful?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 8 of the units will be successful, we need to consider the cases where 8, 9, or 10 units are successful. We can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability for each case and then sum them up.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.87)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10)\n- k is the number of successes\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of having exactly 8 successful units:\n\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.87^8 * (1-0.87)^(10-8)\nP(X = 8) = (10! / (8!2!)) * 0.87^8 * 0.13^2\nP(X = 8) ≈ 0.2835\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of having exactly 9 successful units:\n\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.87^9 * (1-0.87)^(10-9)\nP(X = 9) = (10! / (9!1!)) * 0.87^9 * 0.13^1\nP(X = 9) ≈ 0.2366\n\nFinally, let's calculate the probability of having all 10 successful units:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.87^10 * (1-0.87)^(10-10)\nP(X = 10) = (10! / (10!0!)) * 0.87^10 * 0.13^0\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.0573\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(at least 8 successful units) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\nP(at least 8 successful units) ≈ 0.2835 + 0.2366 + 0.0573\nP(at least 8 successful units) ≈ 0.5774\n\nSo, the probability that at least 8 of the units will be successful is approximately 57.74%."
