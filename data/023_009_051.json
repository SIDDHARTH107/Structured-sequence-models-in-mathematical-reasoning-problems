    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using Fourier series, we first need to rewrite the given differential equation in terms of a Fourier series. Since the given problem is homogeneous, we can assume that the solution u(x) can be represented as a Fourier sine series:\n\nu(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(n * π * x / L))\n\nwhere b_n are the Fourier coefficients to be determined.\n\nNow, we differentiate u(x) twice with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = ∑(n * π * b_n * cos(n * π * x / L) / L)\n\nu''(x) = -∑((n * π / L)^2 * b_n * sin(n * π * x / L))\n\nSubstitute u(x) and u''(x) into the given differential equation:\n\n-∑((n * π / L)^2 * b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)) + ∑(b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)) = 0\n\nNow, we apply the given boundary conditions:\n\nu(0) = 0 => ∑(b_n * sin(0)) = 0, which is satisfied for all n.\n\nu'(L) + u(L) = 1 => ∑(n * π * b_n * cos(n * π) / L) + ∑(b_n * sin(n * π)) = 1\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the second term in the above equation becomes 0. Also, cos(n * π) = (-1)^n. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n∑(n * π * b_n * (-1)^n / L) = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier coefficients b_n that satisfy the above equation. Since the equation is not in the standard form to find Fourier coefficients, we cannot directly apply the Fourier coefficient formula. However, we can try to find a particular solution that satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's consider the case n = 1:\n\nb_1 * π * (-1)^1 / L = 1\n\nb_1 = -L / π\n\nNow, we can write the solution u(x) as:\n\nu(x) = -L * sin(π * x / L) / π + ∑(b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)) for n = 2, 3, ...\n\nThe first term in the above expression is a particular solution that satisfies the boundary conditions, and the remaining terms represent the homogeneous solution. Since the given problem is linear, the sum of the particular solution and the homogeneous solution will also be a solution to the problem.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the given boundary value problem is:\n\nu(x) = -L * sin(π * x / L) / π + ∑(b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)) for n = 2, 3, ..."
