    "message_2": "To prove that G has a subgroup of order 15 and that this subgroup is normal in G, we will use Sylow's Theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5. By Sylow's First Theorem, G has Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor p of its order. Let's denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor p as n_p.\n\nBy Sylow's Third Theorem, we have the following conditions:\n1. n_2 divides 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 10 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n3. n_5 divides 6 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFrom condition 1, we see that n_2 can be 1 or 3. From condition 2, n_3 must be 1. From condition 3, n_5 must be 1. \n\nNow, let P_3 and P_5 be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup and Sylow 5-subgroup of G, respectively. Since n_3 = n_5 = 1, both P_3 and P_5 are normal in G (by Sylow's Second Theorem). \n\nLet H be the subgroup generated by the product of P_3 and P_5. Since P_3 and P_5 are both normal in G, H is also a subgroup of G. By the formula for the order of a product of two subgroups, we have:\n\n|H| = (|P_3| * |P_5|) / |P_3 ∩ P_5|\n\nSince P_3 and P_5 have prime orders 3 and 5, respectively, their intersection can only be the identity element. Thus, |P_3 ∩ P_5| = 1, and |H| = (3 * 5) / 1 = 15. So, G has a subgroup H of order 15.\n\nFurthermore, since both P_3 and P_5 are normal in G, their product H is also normal in G.\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nLet x be an element of order 2 in G. Since n_2 can be 1 or 3, there are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, which implies that P_2 is normal in G. Since P_2, P_3, and P_5 are all normal in G, their product, which has order 30, is also normal in G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2, P_3, and P_5, which is the cyclic group C30.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups. Let P_2 be one of them. Since H is normal in G, we can consider the action of x on H by conjugation. For any h in H, we have:\n\nxhx^(-1) = h'\n\nwhere h' is also an element of H. Since x has order 2, x^(-1) = x, and we have:\n\nxhx = h'\n\nThis is the same as the action of x on H in the dihedral group D15. Therefore, G contains a subgroup isomorphic to D15.\n\nNow, let's consider the centralizer of x in G, denoted by C_G(x). Since x is an element of order 2, C_G(x) contains a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Also, H is a normal subgroup of G, so H is a subgroup of C_G(x). Thus, C_G(x) has order at least 2 * 15 = 30, which implies that C_G(x) = G. This means that x commutes with every element in H.\n\nNow, let K be the subgroup generated by x and H. Since x commutes with every element in H, the order of K is 2 * 15 = 30. Thus, K = G.\n\nFinally, we consider the structure of G. Since G contains a subgroup isomorphic to D15, G can be either the dihedral group D15 or a non-abelian group of order 30. If G is abelian, then G would be isomorphic to C30, which contradicts the fact that n_2 = 3. Therefore, G must be the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
