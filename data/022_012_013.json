    "message_1": "Let $f(z) = \\frac{z^2-2z+3}{z^3-4}$ be a meromorphic function on the complex plane. Determine the location and order of any poles and zeroes of $f(z)$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the zeroes of $f(z)$. A zero of $f(z)$ is a value of $z$ such that $f(z) = 0$. This occurs when the numerator of the fraction is equal to zero:\n\n$z^2 - 2z + 3 = 0$\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n$z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 12}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-8}}{2}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the zeroes of $f(z)$ are complex:\n\n$z = 1 \\pm i\\sqrt{2}$\n\nNow, let's find the poles of $f(z)$. A pole of $f(z)$ is a value of $z$ such that $f(z)$ is infinite. This occurs when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero:\n\n$z^3 - 4 = 0$\n\nWe can solve this cubic equation by factoring:\n\n$z^3 = 4$\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\n\n$z = \\sqrt[3]{4}$\n\nSince we are working in the complex plane, we need to consider all three cube roots of 4:\n\n$z = 4^{\\frac{1}{3}}, 4^{\\frac{1}{3}}e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}}, 4^{\\frac{1}{3}}e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}}$\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the poles. The order of a pole is the multiplicity of the root in the denominator. Since the denominator is a cubic polynomial with distinct roots, each pole has order 1.\n\nIn summary, $f(z)$ has zeroes at $z = 1 \\pm i\\sqrt{2}$ and poles of order 1 at $z = 4^{\\frac{1}{3}}, 4^{\\frac{1}{3}}e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}}, 4^{\\frac{1}{3}}e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}}$."
