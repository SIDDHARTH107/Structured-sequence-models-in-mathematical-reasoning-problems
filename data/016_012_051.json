    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that its length increases with each iteration. In each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of 3. \n\nTo find the total length of the Peano curve after the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (Length Multiplier)^(Number of Iterations)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, the length multiplier is 3, and the number of iterations is 5.\n\nLength = 1 * (3)^5\nLength = 1 * 243\nLength = 243\n\nSo, the total length of the Peano curve after the 5th iteration is 243."
