    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 5, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 12)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 5 with respect to x is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12."
