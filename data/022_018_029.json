    "message_2": "Given the partial differential equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\overline{z}}= z^2$$\n\nand the function:\n\n$$u(z,\\overline{z})= f(z)+g(\\overline{z})$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial derivatives of $u(z,\\overline{z})$ with respect to $z$ and $\\overline{z}$. Since $f(z)$ is a function of $z$ and $g(\\overline{z})$ is a function of $\\overline{z}$, their partial derivatives are:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f(z)}{\\partial z} = f'(z)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial g(\\overline{z})}{\\partial \\overline{z}} = g'(\\overline{z})$$\n\nNow, we can find the partial derivative of $u(z,\\overline{z})$ with respect to $\\overline{z}$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\partial f(z)}{\\partial \\overline{z}} + \\frac{\\partial g(\\overline{z})}{\\partial \\overline{z}} = 0 + g'(\\overline{z}) = g'(\\overline{z})$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$$g'(\\overline{z}) = z^2$$\n\nSince $g'(\\overline{z})$ is a function of $\\overline{z}$ and the right-hand side is a function of $z$, the only way for this equation to hold true is if both sides are equal to a constant. However, since the region is $|z|<1$, the right-hand side is not a constant. Therefore, there is no solution for $f(z)$ and $g(\\overline{z})$ that satisfies the given partial differential equation in the region $|z|<1$."
