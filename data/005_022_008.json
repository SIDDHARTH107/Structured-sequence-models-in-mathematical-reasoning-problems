    "message_1": "In a statistics class, the teacher gave the following grades for a test: 70, 75, 85, 90, 92, 95, and 100. The student noticed that one of the grades seemed to be an outlier. Using the median of the data set, determine which grade could be an outlier according to a robust statistics approach.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is an outlier using a robust statistics approach, we can use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. First, we need to find the median, Q1 (first quartile), and Q3 (third quartile) of the data set.\n\nThe given data set is: 70, 75, 85, 90, 92, 95, 100\n\nThe median (Q2) is the middle value: 90\n\nNow, we need to find Q1 and Q3. Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data.\n\nLower half: 70, 75, 85\nUpper half: 92, 95, 100\n\nQ1 (median of lower half): 75\nQ3 (median of upper half): 95\n\nNext, we calculate the IQR, which is the difference between Q3 and Q1:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 95 - 75 = 20\n\nNow, we can find the lower and upper bounds for potential outliers:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 75 - 1.5 * 20 = 45\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 95 + 1.5 * 20 = 125\n\nAny data point outside of these bounds could be considered an outlier. In this case, all the grades are within the range of 45 to 125, so there are no outliers according to the robust statistics approach using the IQR method."
