    "message_2": "To compute the third Chern class $c_3(M)$, we can use the Chern polynomial. The Chern polynomial is given by:\n\n$P(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^n c_i(M) t^{n-i}$,\n\nwhere $n$ is the complex dimension of the manifold $M$, and $c_i(M)$ are the Chern classes of $M$. The Chern polynomial satisfies the splitting principle, which states that the Chern polynomial of a direct sum of line bundles is the product of the Chern polynomials of the individual line bundles. In other words, if $M = L_1 \\oplus L_2 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus L_n$, then\n\n$P_M(t) = P_{L_1}(t) P_{L_2}(t) \\cdots P_{L_n}(t)$.\n\nThe Chern polynomial of a line bundle $L$ with first Chern class $c_1(L)$ is given by\n\n$P_L(t) = 1 + c_1(L) t$.\n\nNow, let's compute the Chern polynomial of the manifold $M$. Since $M$ is a complex manifold, its complex dimension is $n = 3$. Thus, the Chern polynomial of $M$ is given by\n\n$P_M(t) = 1 + c_1(M) t + c_2(M) t^2 + c_3(M) t^3$.\n\nWe are given that $c_1(M) = -3a + 2b$ and $c_2(M) = 10a^2 + 20ab - 12b^2$. Substituting these values into the Chern polynomial, we get\n\n$P_M(t) = 1 + (-3a + 2b) t + (10a^2 + 20ab - 12b^2) t^2 + c_3(M) t^3$.\n\nTo find $c_3(M)$, we can use the splitting principle. Suppose that $M = L_1 \\oplus L_2 \\oplus L_3$. Then, the Chern polynomial of $M$ is the product of the Chern polynomials of the individual line bundles:\n\n$P_M(t) = P_{L_1}(t) P_{L_2}(t) P_{L_3}(t) = (1 + c_1(L_1) t)(1 + c_1(L_2) t)(1 + c_1(L_3) t)$.\n\nExpanding this product, we get\n\n$P_M(t) = 1 + (c_1(L_1) + c_1(L_2) + c_1(L_3)) t + \\cdots + c_1(L_1) c_1(L_2) c_1(L_3) t^3$.\n\nComparing the coefficients of the $t^3$ terms in the two expressions for $P_M(t)$, we find that\n\n$c_3(M) = c_1(L_1) c_1(L_2) c_1(L_3)$.\n\nHowever, without more information about the line bundles $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$, we cannot compute $c_3(M)$ explicitly."
