    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"MATHS\" using the Rail fence cipher with a depth of 3, we write the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nM - - - S\n- A - H -\n- - T - -\n\nNow, we read the letters in each row from left to right to get the ciphertext. The resulting ciphertext is \"MSAHT\"."
