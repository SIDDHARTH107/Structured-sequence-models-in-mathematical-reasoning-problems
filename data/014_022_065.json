    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher encrypted message, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair cipher table using the key \"MATHS\". \n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters from left to right, top to bottom.\n2. Fill in the remaining spaces in the table with the rest of the alphabet, excluding the letter 'J' (since 'I' and 'J' are combined in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe resulting table is:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message \"VHFWWR\" using the following rules:\n\n1. If the two letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If the two letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the two letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nDecrypting the message:\n- VH -> SE\n- FW -> CR\n- WR -> ET\n\nThe decrypted plaintext message is \"SECRET\"."
