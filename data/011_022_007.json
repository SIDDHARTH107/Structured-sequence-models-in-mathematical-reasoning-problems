    "message_1": "A backpack has a capacity of 15 kg. You have 6 items to carry with respective weights {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8} kg and respective profits {3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12} dollars. What is the maximum profit you can get by carrying the items without exceeding the capacity of the backpack? (Note: you can only carry one item of each type).",
    "message_2": "This is a classic example of the 0/1 Knapsack problem. We can solve this using dynamic programming. Let's create a table with rows representing the items and columns representing the capacity of the backpack from 0 to 15.\n\nLet's denote the table as dp[i][j], where i represents the index of the item and j represents the current capacity of the backpack. The value of dp[i][j] will represent the maximum profit that can be obtained using items up to index i and with a backpack capacity of j.\n\nWe will fill the table using the following rules:\n1. If the current capacity (j) is less than the weight of the current item (weights[i]), then we can't include this item, so the maximum profit will be the same as the previous row (dp[i-1][j]).\n2. If the current capacity (j) is greater than or equal to the weight of the current item (weights[i]), then we have two choices: either include the item or not include the item. We will choose the one that gives us the maximum profit.\n\ndp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], profits[i] + dp[i-1][j-weights[i]])\n\nFinally, the maximum profit will be stored in the last cell of the table, dp[5][15].\n\nHere's the filled table:\n\n```\n  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n0  0  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3\n1  0  3  5  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8\n2  0  3  5  8  9 11 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14\n3  0  3  5  8  9 11 14 15 16 18 21 21 21 21 21\n4  0  3  5  8  9 11 14 15 16 18 21 22 23 25 28\n5  0  3  5  8  9 11 14 15 16 18 21 22 23 25 28\n```\n\nThe maximum profit that can be obtained without exceeding the capacity of the backpack is 28 dollars."
