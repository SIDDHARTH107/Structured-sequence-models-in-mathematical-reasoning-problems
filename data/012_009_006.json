    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and the following degree sequence: 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1. Determine if this graph is connected or disconnected. If it is connected, draw an example of the graph that could have this degree sequence. If it is disconnected, explain why.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17, which is an odd number. Since the sum of the degrees must be even, this degree sequence is not possible for a simple graph.\n\nHowever, if we still want to analyze the connectivity of a graph with this degree sequence, we can try to construct a graph using the Havel-Hakimi algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Sort the degree sequence in non-increasing order.\n2. Remove the first number (d) from the sequence and reduce the next d numbers by 1.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all numbers are 0 or the sequence becomes invalid.\n\nApplying the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to the given degree sequence:\n\n1. Sorted sequence: 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1\n2. Remove 4 and reduce the next 4 numbers by 1: 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n3. Sort the sequence: 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n4. Remove 2 and reduce the next 2 numbers by 1: 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n5. Sort the sequence: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0\n6. Remove 1 and reduce the next 1 number by 1: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0\n\nAt this point, we have a non-increasing sequence with non-negative numbers, but it does not sum to zero. This means that the given degree sequence is not graphical, and we cannot construct a simple graph with this degree sequence.\n\nSince we cannot construct a simple graph with the given degree sequence, we cannot determine if it is connected or disconnected."
