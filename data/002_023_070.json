    "message_2": "The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by A = 4πr², where A is the surface area and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven a radius of 7 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nA = 4π(7 cm)²\nA ≈ 4 × 3.14159 × 49 cm²\nA ≈ 12.56636 × 49 cm²\nA ≈ 615.752 cm²\n\nRounding to the nearest square centimeter, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 616 cm²."
