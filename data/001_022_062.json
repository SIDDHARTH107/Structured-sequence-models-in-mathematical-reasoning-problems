    "message_2": "The y-intercept of a polynomial equation occurs when x = 0. To find the y-intercept, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at x = 0.\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^3 - 2(0)^2 + 5(0) - 7\nf(0) = 0 - 0 + 0 - 7\nf(0) = -7\n\nSo, the y-intercept of the polynomial equation f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7 is -7, or the point (0, -7) on the coordinate plane."
