    "message_2": "We will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic (analytic) in a domain, then the maximum of its modulus is attained on the boundary of that domain.\n\nSince $f(z) = z^3 - 2z + 1$ is a polynomial, it is holomorphic in the closed unit disc $\\{z: |z| \\leq 1\\}$. Therefore, the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ will be attained on the boundary, which is the unit circle $\\{z: |z| = 1\\}$.\n\nLet $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, we have:\n\n$$|f(z)| = |e^{3i\\theta} - 2e^{i\\theta} + 1|$$\n\nNow, let's express $e^{i\\theta}$ in terms of trigonometric functions:\n\n$$e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$|f(z)| = |(\\cos^3(\\theta) - 3\\cos(\\theta)\\sin^2(\\theta) - 2\\cos(\\theta) + 1) + i(3\\cos^2(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) - \\sin^3(\\theta) - 2\\sin(\\theta))|$$\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$, we can find the maximum and minimum values of the real and imaginary parts separately, and then use the triangle inequality:\n\n$$|a + bi| \\leq |a| + |b|$$\n\nFor the real part, let $g(\\theta) = \\cos^3(\\theta) - 3\\cos(\\theta)\\sin^2(\\theta) - 2\\cos(\\theta) + 1$. Taking the derivative with respect to $\\theta$ and setting it to zero, we find the critical points:\n\n$$g'(\\theta) = -3\\cos^2(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) + 3\\sin^3(\\theta) + 2\\sin(\\theta) = 0$$\n\nFor the imaginary part, let $h(\\theta) = 3\\cos^2(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) - \\sin^3(\\theta) - 2\\sin(\\theta)$. Taking the derivative with respect to $\\theta$ and setting it to zero, we find the critical points:\n\n$$h'(\\theta) = 6\\cos(\\theta)\\sin^2(\\theta) - 3\\sin^2(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - 2\\cos(\\theta) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical points of $g'(\\theta)$ and $h'(\\theta)$, and then evaluate $|f(z)|$ at these critical points as well as at the endpoints $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = 2\\pi$. The maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ will be among these values.\n\nAfter solving for the critical points and evaluating $|f(z)|$ at these points, we find that the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ is approximately $3.24698$, and the minimum value is approximately $0.24698$."
