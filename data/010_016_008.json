    "message_2": "First, let's show that the intersection product A ∩ B ∈ H_r(A ∩ B ; F) vanishes for every r ≠ n - dim(A) - dim(B). Since A and B intersect transversally, we know that the dimension of A ∩ B is dim(A) + dim(B) - n. Therefore, if r ≠ n - dim(A) - dim(B), the homology group H_r(A ∩ B ; F) is trivial, and the intersection product A ∩ B must vanish.\n\nNow, let's show that the intersection product satisfies the Poincaré duality formula [A] ∩ [B] = [A ∩ B] in H_n - dim(A) - dim(B)(X ; F). By the Poincaré duality theorem, we have:\n\n[X] ∩ [A] = [A] in H_{n-dim(A)}(X; F)\n[X] ∩ [B] = [B] in H_{n-dim(B)}(X; F)\n\nTaking the intersection product of these two equations, we get:\n\n([X] ∩ [A]) ∩ [B] = [A] ∩ [B]\n\nBy the associativity of the intersection product, we can rewrite this as:\n\n[X] ∩ ([A] ∩ [B]) = [A] ∩ [B]\n\nSince [X] is the fundamental class, we have:\n\n[A] ∩ [B] = [A ∩ B] in H_n - dim(A) - dim(B)(X ; F)\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case where X is a 3-dimensional compact space with a fundamental class [X] over a field F, A is a unit sphere (dim(A) = 2), and B is a torus (dim(B) = 1). We want to calculate the degree of intersection of A and B.\n\nIn this case, n = 3, dim(A) = 2, and dim(B) = 1. Therefore, the intersection product A ∩ B ∈ H_r(A ∩ B ; F) vanishes for every r ≠ n - dim(A) - dim(B) = 3 - 2 - 1 = 0. Since the intersection product is non-zero only in H_0(A ∩ B ; F), the degree of intersection of A and B is the rank of H_0(A ∩ B ; F).\n\nSince A and B intersect transversally, the intersection points of A and B form a 0-dimensional closed subset of X. The rank of H_0(A ∩ B ; F) is equal to the number of connected components in A ∩ B, which is the number of intersection points of A and B.\n\nIn this case, a unit sphere and a torus can intersect at most in two points (imagine the torus surrounding the sphere, touching it at two antipodal points). Therefore, the degree of intersection of A and B is 2."
