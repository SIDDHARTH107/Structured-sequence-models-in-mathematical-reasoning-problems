    "message_2": "To minimize the total time needed to complete all jobs without any machine idling time, we can assign the jobs to the machines in such a way that the total time for each machine is as close as possible.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time for each job:\n\nJob A: 5 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 12\nJob B: 3 + 1 + 6 + 2 = 12\nJob C: 2 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 13\nJob D: 6 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 15\nJob E: 4 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 12\nJob F: 1 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 11\n\nNow, let's assign the jobs to the machines in a way that balances the total time for each machine:\n\nMachine 1: Job D (6) + Job F (1) = 7\nMachine 2: Job C (6) + Job E (2) = 8\nMachine 3: Job B (6) + Job A (4) = 10\nMachine 4: Job A (1) + Job B (2) + Job C (2) + Job E (5) = 10\n\nThe minimum time needed to complete all the jobs using all the available machines without any machine idling time is 10."
