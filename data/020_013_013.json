    "message_2": "To solve this semi-definite program, we first need to find the feasible region and then optimize the objective function within that region.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the following constraints:\n\n1. $2x_1 + x_2 \\leq 3$\n2. $x_1 + 2x_2 \\leq 3$\n3. $x_1, x_2 \\geq 0$\n4. $\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & x_1 & x_2 \\\\\nx_1 & 2 & 0 \\\\\nx_2 & 0 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix} \\succeq 0$\n\nThe first three constraints define a polygon in the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane. To find the vertices of this polygon, we need to find the intersection points of the lines defined by the constraints:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n\n$2x_1 + x_2 = 3$\n\n$x_1 + 2x_2 = 3$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and $x_1 = 0$:\n\n$2x_1 + x_2 = 3$\n\n$x_1 = 0$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 3$.\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and $x_2 = 0$:\n\n$x_1 + 2x_2 = 3$\n\n$x_2 = 0$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get $x_1 = 3$ and $x_2 = 0$.\n\nNow we need to check if these intersection points satisfy the semi-definite constraint:\n\nFor $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 1)$:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix} \\succeq 0$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are approximately 0.414, 2.586, and 3, which are all non-negative.

Therefore, $(3, 0)$ is not a feasible point.\n\nSo, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$, and $(0, 1.5)$.\n\nNow we need to optimize the objective function $x_1 + x_2$ within this feasible region. Since the objective function is linear, the optimal solution will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFor $(0, 0)$, the objective function value is $0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nFor $(1, 1)$, the objective function value is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nFor $(0, 1.5)$, the objective function value is $0 + 1.5 = 1.5$.\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 2, which occurs at the point $(1, 1)$. Therefore, the optimal solution is $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 1)$, and the optimal value is 2."
