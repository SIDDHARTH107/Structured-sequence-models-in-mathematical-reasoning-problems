    "message_2": "To find the solution set for the inequality \"2x + 3y ≤ 12\" on the coordinate plane, we first need to find the boundary line, which is the line formed when the inequality is an equation (2x + 3y = 12). Then, we'll determine which side of the line contains the solutions that satisfy the inequality.\n\n1. Find the x and y-intercepts of the boundary line:\nFor the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x:\n2x + 3(0) = 12\n2x = 12\nx = 6\nSo, the x-intercept is (6, 0).\n\nFor the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y:\n2(0) + 3y = 12\n3y = 12\ny = 4\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 4).\n\n2. Plot the boundary line:\nPlot the points (6, 0) and (0, 4) on the coordinate plane and draw a straight line through them. Since the inequality is \"less than or equal to,\" the line should be solid, indicating that the points on the line are included in the solution set.\n\n3. Determine which side of the line contains the solutions:\nChoose a test point that is not on the line, such as the origin (0, 0). Plug the coordinates of the test point into the inequality:\n2(0) + 3(0) ≤ 12\n0 ≤ 12\nThis statement is true, so the side of the line containing the origin (0, 0) is the solution set for the inequality.\n\nThe solution set for the inequality \"2x + 3y ≤ 12\" is the region on or below the line 2x + 3y = 12 in the coordinate plane."
