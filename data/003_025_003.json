    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the plane's velocity vector, we can break the velocity into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components using trigonometry.\n\nThe horizontal component (x) can be found using the cosine function:\nx = magnitude * cos(angle)\nx = 400 mph * cos(30°)\n\nThe vertical component (y) can be found using the sine function:\ny = magnitude * sin(angle)\ny = 400 mph * sin(30°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n30° * (π/180) = 0.5236 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the x and y components:\nx = 400 mph * cos(0.5236) ≈ 346.41 mph\ny = 400 mph * sin(0.5236) ≈ 200 mph\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\nmagnitude = √(x^2 + y^2)\nmagnitude = √(346.41^2 + 200^2) ≈ 400 mph\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector can be found using the arctangent function:\ndirection = arctan(y/x)\ndirection = arctan(200/346.41)\n\nConvert the angle from radians to degrees:\ndirection ≈ 30°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the plane's velocity vector is 400 mph, and its direction is 30° with respect to the ground."
