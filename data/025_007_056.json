    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups H¹(X, OX) and H²(X, OX) of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on X, we can use the fact that X is a smooth projective curve of genus g. For a smooth projective curve, the cohomology groups can be determined using the following formulas:\n\nH¹(X, OX) = C^(g), where C is the field of complex numbers and g is the genus of the curve.\nH²(X, OX) = 0, since the curve is a one-dimensional complex manifold.\n\nTo find the genus g of the cubic curve X, we can use the formula for the genus of a smooth plane curve of degree d:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nIn our case, the degree d of the cubic curve X is 3. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = (2)(1)/2 = 1\n\nSo the genus of the curve X is 1. Now we can compute the cohomology groups:\n\nH¹(X, OX) = C^(1) = C\nH²(X, OX) = 0\n\nThus, the cohomology groups of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on the smooth cubic curve X are H¹(X, OX) = C and H²(X, OX) = 0."
