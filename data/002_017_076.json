    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one triangle, then multiply it by the number of triangles (6 in this case).\n\nThe side length of the equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon, which is 8 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length:\n\nArea = (8² * √3) / 4\nArea = (64 * √3) / 4\nArea = 16√3 cm²\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one triangle by the number of triangles in the hexagon:\n\nTotal area of hexagon = 6 * (16√3 cm²)\nTotal area of hexagon = 96√3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon is 96√3 cm²."
