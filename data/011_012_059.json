    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nTotal number of students = Number of students taking math class + Number of students taking biology class - Number of students taking both classes\n\nTotal number of students = 20 (math) + 15 (biology) - 10 (both)\n\nTotal number of students = 35 - 10 = 25\n\nSince there are 40 students in the group, the number of students not taking either class is:\n\n40 - 25 = 15 students."
