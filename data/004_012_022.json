    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 5x + 6) / (2x + 1) using the quotient rule, we first identify the numerator function as u(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6 and the denominator function as v(x) = 2x + 1.\n\nThe quotient rule states that if we have a function f(x) = u(x) / v(x), then the derivative f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(u(x))/dx = d(x^2 + 5x + 6)/dx = 2x + 5\nv'(x) = d(v(x))/dx = d(2x + 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = ((2x + 5)(2x + 1) - (x^2 + 5x + 6)(2)) / (2x + 1)^2\n\nNow, we expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (4x^2 + 10x + 2x + 5 - 2x^2 - 10x - 12) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)\n\nf'(x) = (2x^2 + 2x - 7) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 5x + 6) / (2x + 1) is:\n\nf'(x) = (2x^2 + 2x - 7) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)"
