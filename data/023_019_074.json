    "message_2": "To determine if the modified system remains stable, we can analyze the poles of the transfer function. A system is stable if all its poles have negative real parts. The poles of the transfer function are the values of s that make the denominator equal to zero.\n\nThe modified transfer function is H(s) = 3/((s^2 + 2s + 5)(s+4)). The denominator is the same as the original transfer function, which means the poles of the modified system are the same as the original system. Since the original system is known to be stable, all its poles have negative real parts.\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the transfer function:\n\n1. For the quadratic term (s^2 + 2s + 5), we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 5:\n\ns = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4*1*5)) / 2*1\ns = (-2 ± √(-16)) / 2\ns = -1 ± 2j\n\nThe poles for this term are complex conjugates with negative real parts, so they are stable.\n\n2. For the linear term (s+4), the pole is simply:\n\ns = -4\n\nThis pole has a negative real part, so it is also stable.\n\nSince all the poles of the modified transfer function have negative real parts, the modified system remains stable. The constant factor 3 in the numerator does not affect the stability of the system, as it only scales the system's response. Therefore, the modified system H(s) = 3/((s^2 + 2s + 5)(s+4)) is stable."
