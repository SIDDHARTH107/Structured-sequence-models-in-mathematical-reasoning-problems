    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset with the following values: 12, 18, 25, 27, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55. \n\nFind the median and the interquartile range for this dataset.",
    "message_2": "To find the median, we first need to determine the middle value(s) of the dataset. Since there are 10 values in the dataset, the middle values are the 5th and 6th values. In this case, the middle values are 30 and 35. To find the median, we take the average of these two values:\n\nMedian = (30 + 35) / 2 = 65 / 2 = 32.5\n\nNext, we need to find the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). To find Q1, we look at the median of the lower half of the dataset (not including the overall median if the dataset has an odd number of values). In this case, the lower half of the dataset is 12, 18, 25, and 27. The median of this lower half is:\n\nQ1 = (18 + 25) / 2 = 43 / 2 = 21.5\n\nTo find Q3, we look at the median of the upper half of the dataset (not including the overall median if the dataset has an odd number of values). In this case, the upper half of the dataset is 40, 45, 50, and 55. The median of this upper half is:\n\nQ3 = (45 + 50) / 2 = 95 / 2 = 47.5\n\nFinally, we find the interquartile range by subtracting Q1 from Q3:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 47.5 - 21.5 = 26\n\nSo, the median of the dataset is 32.5, and the interquartile range is 26."
