Let A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} and B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}. Are they isomorphic? If yes, provide an isomorphism. If no, explain why.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the two graphs are isomorphic, we can compare their properties and look for a possible isomorphism. First, let's analyze the degree sequences of both graphs.\n\nFor graph A, the degree sequence is (1, 2, 1), meaning that there is one vertex with degree 1, one vertex with degree 2, and another vertex with degree 1.\n\nFor graph B, the degree sequence is also (1, 2, 1), meaning that there is one vertex with degree 1, one vertex with degree 2, and another vertex with degree 1.\n\nSince the degree sequences are the same, there is a possibility that the graphs are isomorphic. Now, let's try to find an isomorphism between the two graphs.\n\nLet's label the vertices of graph A as a1, a2, and a3, and the vertices of graph B as b1, b2, and b3. We can try to map the vertices of graph A to the vertices of graph B in a way that preserves the adjacency relationships.\n\nOne possible mapping is:\n\na1 -> b2\na2 -> b1\na3 -> b3\n\nWith this mapping, the adjacency relationships are preserved:\n\n- a1 is adjacent to a2, and b2 is adjacent to b1.\n- a2 is adjacent to a3, and b1 is adjacent to b3.\n- a1 is not adjacent to a3, and b2 is not adjacent to b3.\n\nSince we found an isomorphism between the two graphs, we can conclude that the graphs A and B are isomorphic."
