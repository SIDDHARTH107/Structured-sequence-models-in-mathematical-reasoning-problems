The cost (in thousands of dollars) to lay a line between each pair of offices and their distances (in kilometers) are given in the following table:\n\n|         | A     | B     | C     | D     | E     | F     |\n|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| A       | 0     | 4     | 6     | 8     | 12    | 14    |\n| B       | 4     | 0     | 6     | 6     | 8     | 10    |\n| C       | 6     | 6     | 0     | 4     | 8     | 10    |\n| D       | 8     | 6     | 4     | 0     | 6     | 8     |\n| E       | 12    | 8     | 8     | 6     | 0     | 4     |\n| F       | 14    | 10    | 10    | 8     | 4     | 0     |\n\nThe company wants to connect all six regional offices while minimizing the total cost of laying the communication lines. What is the least cost to connect all the offices, and what is the optimal network layout?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. In this case, the graph represents the regional offices and the costs of connecting them.\n\n1. Sort all the edges (communication lines) in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights (costs).\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\nSorted edges by cost:\n(A, B): 4\n(E, F): 4\n(C, D): 4\n(B, D): 6\n(D, E): 6\n(A, C): 6\n(B, E): 8\n(C, E): 8\n(B, F): 10\n(C, F): 10\n(D, F): 8\n(A, D): 8\n(A, E): 12\n(A, F): 14\n\nNow, we add the edges to the minimum spanning tree while ensuring no cycles are formed:\n\n1. Add (A, B): 4\n2. Add (E, F): 4\n3. Add (C, D): 4\n4. Add (B, D): 6 (A-B-D-C forms a cycle, so skip this edge)\n5. Add (D, E): 6\n6. Add (A, C): 6 (A-B-C-D-E-F forms a cycle, so skip this edge)\n\nThe optimal network layout is A-B, E-F, C-D, D-E with a total cost of 4 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 18 (in thousands of dollars)."
