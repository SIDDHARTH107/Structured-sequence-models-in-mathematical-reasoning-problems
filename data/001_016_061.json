    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $2^3\\times 2^5$, we use the product of powers property, which states that $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$.\n\nIn this case, $a = 2$, $m = 3$, and $n = 5$. So, we have:\n\n$2^3\\times 2^5 = 2^{3+5} = 2^8$\n\nTherefore, the simplified exponential expression is $2^8$."
