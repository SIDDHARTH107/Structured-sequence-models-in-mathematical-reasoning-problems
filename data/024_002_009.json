    "message_2": "The initial point (0,0,0) is not on the surface of a sphere with radius 3, as it is at the center of the sphere. Therefore, we need to choose a different initial point on the surface of the sphere. Let's assume the initial point is A and the final point is B, with coordinates (x1, y1, z1) and (2, 2, 2), respectively.\n\nTo find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere with radius 3, we need to find the shortest path between two points on the sphere. The shortest path between two points on a sphere is a segment of a great circle, which is the intersection of the sphere with a plane that passes through the center of the sphere.\n\nLet's denote the center of the sphere as O (0, 0, 0). Then, the plane containing points A, B, and O is determined by the normal vector N, which is the cross product of vectors OA and OB:\n\nN = OA x OB\n\nSince OA = (x1, y1, z1) and OB = (2, 2, 2), we have:\n\nN = (y1 * 2 - z1 * 2, z1 * 2 - x1 * 2, x1 * 2 - y1 * 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the plane containing points A, B, and O:\n\nN • (X - A) = 0\n\nwhere X = (x, y, z) is a point on the plane, and • denotes the dot product.\n\nSubstituting the values of N and A, we get:\n\n(y1 * 2 - z1 * 2)(x - x1) + (z1 * 2 - x1 * 2)(y - y1) + (x1 * 2 - y1 * 2)(z - z1) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this plane with the sphere of radius 3. The equation of the sphere is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9\n\nSolving the system of equations formed by the plane and the sphere will give us the equation of the great circle containing points A and B. The geodesic between A and B will be a segment of this great circle.\n\nHowever, without specific coordinates for the initial point A, we cannot find an explicit equation for the geodesic. Once you provide the coordinates for the initial point A, we can proceed with finding the geodesic between A and B on the surface of the sphere with radius 3."
