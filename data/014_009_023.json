    "message_1": "Suppose you have a binary string of length 8: 10101010. Apply the Feistel cipher structure using the following key: 0110. How many rounds of encryption will be required to complete one encryption cycle?",
    "message_2": "The number of rounds in a Feistel cipher is not determined by the input or the key, but rather by the specific implementation of the cipher. In general, more rounds provide better security, but also require more processing time. Common numbers of rounds for Feistel ciphers are 16, 32, or even 64. However, without more information about the specific Feistel cipher being used, it is impossible to determine the exact number of rounds required for one encryption cycle."
