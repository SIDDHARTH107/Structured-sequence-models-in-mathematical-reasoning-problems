    "message_2": "To determine the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v} = \\langle 2, 1 \\rangle$ along the curve $y = \\sqrt{x}$ from the starting point $(1,1)$ to the point where $x = 4$, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve at each point.\n\nThe tangent vector of the curve $y = \\sqrt{x}$ can be found by taking the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. So, we have:\n\n$y = \\sqrt{x} \\Rightarrow y^2 = x \\Rightarrow 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 1 \\Rightarrow \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}$\n\nNow, we can write the tangent vector as $\\vec{T}(x) = \\langle 1, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}} \\rangle$. We want to transport the vector $\\vec{v}$ along the curve such that it remains parallel to the tangent vector at each point. To do this, we can use the concept of parallel transport, which states that the covariant derivative of the transported vector along the curve should be zero.\n\nLet $\\vec{V}(x) = \\langle V_x(x), V_y(x) \\rangle$ be the transported vector along the curve. Then, the covariant derivative of $\\vec{V}(x)$ along the curve is given by:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\vec{T}(x)} \\vec{V}(x) = \\frac{dV_x}{dx} \\langle 1, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}} \\rangle + \\frac{dV_y}{dx} \\langle -\\frac{1}{4x\\sqrt{x}}, 0 \\rangle$\n\nFor the transported vector to remain parallel to the tangent vector, the covariant derivative should be zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\frac{dV_x}{dx} \\langle 1, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}} \\rangle + \\frac{dV_y}{dx} \\langle -\\frac{1}{4x\\sqrt{x}}, 0 \\rangle = \\langle 0, 0 \\rangle$\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{dV_x}{dx} = 0$\n2. $\\frac{dV_y}{dx} - \\frac{1}{4x\\sqrt{x}}\\frac{dV_x}{dx} = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), we have that $V_x(x) = c_1$, where $c_1$ is a constant. Since the initial vector is $\\langle 2, 1 \\rangle$, we have $V_x(1) = 2$, which implies $c_1 = 2$. Thus, $V_x(x) = 2$.\n\nFrom equation (2), we have that $\\frac{dV_y}{dx} = 0$, which implies that $V_y(x) = c_2$, where $c_2$ is another constant. Since the initial vector is $\\langle 2, 1 \\rangle$, we have $V_y(1) = 1$, which implies $c_2 = 1$. Thus, $V_y(x) = 1$.\n\nSo, the transported vector $\\vec{V}(x) = \\langle 2, 1 \\rangle$ is constant along the curve. At the point where $x = 4$, the transported vector is still $\\vec{V}(4) = \\langle 2, 1 \\rangle$."
