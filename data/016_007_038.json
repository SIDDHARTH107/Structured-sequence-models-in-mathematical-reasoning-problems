    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nThe volume of a Menger sponge after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV_n = a^3 * (20/27)^n\n\nwhere V_n is the volume after n iterations, a is the side length of the initial cube, and n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, a = 6 units and n = 6 iterations. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV_6 = 6^3 * (20/27)^6\nV_6 = 216 * (20/27)^6\nV_6 ≈ 216 * 0.0173415\nV_6 ≈ 3.74458\n\nSo, the volume of the Menger sponge with a side length of 6 units after 6 iterations of the construction process is approximately 3.74458 cubic units."
