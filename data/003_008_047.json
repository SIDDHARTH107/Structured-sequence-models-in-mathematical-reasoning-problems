    "message_2": "To find the area of a right triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 12 cm and the height is 5 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 12 cm * 5 cm\n\nArea = 6 cm * 5 cm\n\nArea = 30 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the right triangle is 30 square centimeters."
