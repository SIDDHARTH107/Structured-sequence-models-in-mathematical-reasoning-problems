    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 1, we will first find the derivative with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is given by:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we have:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 2\n\nNow, we will evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 10(2) + 2\nf'(2) = 3(4) - 20 + 2\nf'(2) = 12 - 20 + 2\nf'(2) = -6\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 1 at x = 2 is -6."
