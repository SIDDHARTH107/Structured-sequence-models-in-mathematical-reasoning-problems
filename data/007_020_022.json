    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using RSA encryption, Bob needs to compute the ciphertext C using the formula:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nwhere M is the plaintext message (58), e is the public exponent (7), and n is the modulus (143).\n\nC ≡ 58^7 (mod 143)\n\nUsing modular exponentiation, we can compute:\n\nC ≡ 2494357888 (mod 143)\n\nC ≡ 48 (mod 143)\n\nSo, the encrypted message that Bob should send to Alice is 48."
