    "message_2": "1. Finding all the rational points on the curve C is a difficult task, as there is no general method to find all rational points on an elliptic curve. However, we can find some of the rational points by trying out some small rational values for x and checking if the corresponding y value is also rational.\n\nFor example, let's try x = 0:\ny^2 = (0)^3 - (0)^2 - 5(0) + 3\ny^2 = 3\nSince 3 is not a perfect square, there is no rational y value for x = 0.\n\nNow, let's try x = 1:\ny^2 = (1)^3 - (1)^2 - 5(1) + 3\ny^2 = -2\nAgain, there is no rational y value for x = 1.\n\nLet's try x = 2:\ny^2 = (2)^3 - (2)^2 - 5(2) + 3\ny^2 = 8 - 4 - 10 + 3\ny^2 = -3\nNo rational y value for x = 2.\n\nTrying x = 3:\ny^2 = (3)^3 - (3)^2 - 5(3) + 3\ny^2 = 27 - 9 - 15 + 3\ny^2 = 6\nNo rational y value for x = 3.\n\nTrying x = -1:\ny^2 = (-1)^3 - (-1)^2 - 5(-1) + 3\ny^2 = -1 - 1 + 5 + 3\ny^2 = 6\nNo rational y value for x = -1.\n\nTrying x = -2:\ny^2 = (-2)^3 - (-2)^2 - 5(-2) + 3\ny^2 = -8 - 4 + 10 + 3\ny^2 = 1\ny = Â±1\n\nSo, we found a rational point on the curve: (-2, 1) and (-2, -1).\n\nThere might be more rational points on the curve, but finding all of them is not feasible using this method.\n\n2. To show that there are infinitely many rational points on the curve, we can use the concept of \"rational points on elliptic curves\" and the group law for elliptic curves. The given curve is an elliptic curve, and the set of rational points on an elliptic curve forms a group under the group law for elliptic curves.\n\nThe group law states that given two rational points P and Q on the curve, there exists a third rational point R on the curve such that P + Q = R. This operation is associative and has an identity element (the point at infinity).\n\nSince we found a rational point (-2, 1) on the curve, we can apply the group law repeatedly to generate more rational points. For example, we can compute 2*(-2, 1), 3*(-2, 1), 4*(-2, 1), and so on. Each of these points will also be a rational point on the curve.\n\nTherefore, there are infinitely many rational points on the curve C."
