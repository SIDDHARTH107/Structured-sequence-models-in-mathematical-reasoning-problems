    "message_2": "First, let's list the elements of sets A and B:\n\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nThe symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in both. In other words, it is the union of A and B minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nLet's find the union and intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (all numbers from 0 to 9)\nA ∩ B = {} (empty set, since there are no common elements between odd and even numbers)\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA Δ B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} - {} = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nWe already know that A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A, so:\n\nB Δ A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} - {} = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nSince A Δ B = B Δ A, the symmetric difference is commutative."
