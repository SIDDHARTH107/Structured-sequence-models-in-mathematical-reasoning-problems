    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |5x - 3| = 12, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero, i.e., 5x - 3 â‰¥ 0.\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n5x - 3 = 12\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n5x = 12 + 3\n5x = 15\nx = 15/5\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative, i.e., 5x - 3 < 0.\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n-(5x - 3) = 12\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n-5x + 3 = 12\n-5x = 12 - 3\n-5x = 9\nx = 9/(-5)\nx = -9/5\n\nSo, the solutions for the absolute value equation |5x - 3| = 12 are x = 3 and x = -9/5."
