    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1, -1, 0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives with respect to u and v:\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNext, we find the first fundamental form coefficients:\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, -2v) = -4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, -2v) • (0, 1, -2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we find the normal vector N:\nN = r_u × r_v = (2u, -2v, 1)\n\nWe normalize N:\n|N| = sqrt((2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\nn = N / |N| = (2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we find the second fundamental form coefficients by taking the second derivatives of r(u, v) and dotting them with the normal vector n:\nL = r_uu • n = (0, 0, 2) • (2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = 2 / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\nM = r_uv • n = (0, 0, 0) • (2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = 0\nN = r_vv • n = (0, 0, -2) • (2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = -2 / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nFinally, we find the mean curvature H:\nH = (1/2) * (EN + GL - 2FM) / (EG - F^2)\nH = (1/2) * (L + N) / (E + G - 2F)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 0), we have u = 1 and v = -1. Plugging these values into the expressions for E, F, G, L, and N, we get:\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = -4(1)(-1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(-1)^2 = 5\nL = 2 / sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(-1)^2 + 1) = 2 / sqrt(9) = 2/3\nN = -2 / sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(-1)^2 + 1) = -2 / sqrt(9) = -2/3\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H:\nH = (1/2) * (L + N) / (E + G - 2F)\nH = (1/2) * (2/3 - 2/3) / (5 + 5 - 2*4)\nH = 0 / 2\nH = 0\n\nThe mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1, -1, 0) is 0."
