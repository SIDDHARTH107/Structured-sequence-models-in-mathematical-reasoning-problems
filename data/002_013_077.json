    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 8cm, a width of 5cm, and a height of 12cm. Find the volume of the pyramid.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid is the product of its length and width:\n\nBase area = length * width = 8cm * 5cm = 40cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 40cm² * 12cm = (1/3) * 480cm³ = 160cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
