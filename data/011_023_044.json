    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the maximum degree of the graph, which is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex. This is because the number of colors needed is determined by the maximum number of adjacent vertices that must be colored differently.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph with 7 vertices is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the maximum degree is 6, as each vertex is connected to the other 6 vertices. Therefore, the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 7."
