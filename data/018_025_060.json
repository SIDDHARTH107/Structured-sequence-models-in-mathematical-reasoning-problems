    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted by A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA Δ B = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A Δ B) and B:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, which is denoted by B Δ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, we have:\n\nB Δ A = A Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (B Δ A) and A:\n\n(B Δ A) ∩ A = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1}\n\nWe can see that the two intersection results are not equal:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ B = {4} ≠ {1} = (B Δ A) ∩ A"
