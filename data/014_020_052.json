    "message_2": "To find the length of the key used in a Vigenère cipher, we can compare the plaintext and ciphertext characters and determine the shifts applied to each character. The Vigenère cipher uses modulo arithmetic with a base of 26 (for the 26 letters in the alphabet).\n\nLet's compare the plaintext and ciphertext characters:\n\n1. M -> K: The shift is -2 (K is 2 positions before M in the alphabet). In modulo 26, this is equivalent to 24 (26 - 2).\n2. A -> I: The shift is 8 (I is 8 positions after A in the alphabet).\n3. T -> Y: The shift is 11 (Y is 11 positions after T in the alphabet).\n4. H -> K: The shift is 3 (K is 3 positions after H in the alphabet).\n5. E -> U: The shift is 16 (U is 16 positions after E in the alphabet).\n6. M -> S: The shift is -2 (S is 2 positions before M in the alphabet). In modulo 26, this is equivalent to 24 (26 - 2).\n7. A -> M: The shift is 12 (M is 12 positions after A in the alphabet).\n8. T -> L: The shift is -6 (L is 6 positions before T in the alphabet). In modulo 26, this is equivalent to 20 (26 - 6).\n9. I -> E: The shift is -4 (E is 4 positions before I in the alphabet). In modulo 26, this is equivalent to 22 (26 - 4).\n10. C -> I: The shift is 8 (I is 8 positions after C in the alphabet).\n11. S -> V: The shift is 5 (V is 5 positions after S in the alphabet).\n\nNow, let's look for a pattern in the shifts:\n\n24, 8, 11, 3, 16, 24, 12, 20, 22, 8, 5\n\nWe can see that the sequence \"24, 8, 11\" repeats after the 6th character. This suggests that the key has a length of 3."
