At time t = 0, there are 50 rabbits in the population. If the population doubles every 8 years, what is the value of k?",
    "message_2": "To find the value of k, we'll first need to find the initial condition for the logistic differential equation. We know that at time t = 0, there are 50 rabbits in the population. Since P is the population size in hundreds, we have:\n\nP(0) = 50/100 = 0.5\n\nNow, we are given that the population doubles every 8 years. So, at t = 8, the population will be 100 rabbits, which is:\n\nP(8) = 100/100 = 1\n\nWe can use this information to find the value of k. We have the logistic differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP(1 - P/500)\n\nWe know that at t = 8, P = 1. So, we can plug this into the equation:\n\ndP/dt (at t=8) = k(1)(1 - 1/500)\n\nSince the population doubles every 8 years, the rate of change of the population at t = 8 is equal to the initial population divided by 8:\n\ndP/dt (at t=8) = (1 - 0.5) / 8 = 0.5 / 8 = 1/16\n\nNow, we can solve for k:\n\n1/16 = k(1)(1 - 1/500)\n\n1/16 = k(499/500)\n\nk = (1/16)(500/499)\n\nk â‰ˆ 0.03125\n\nSo, the value of k is approximately 0.03125."
