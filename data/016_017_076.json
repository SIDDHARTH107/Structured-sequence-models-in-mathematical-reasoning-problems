    "message_2": "The perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (Initial length of line segment) * (2^(Iteration number))\n\nIn this case, the initial length of the line segment is 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter of the 10th iteration. So, the formula becomes:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^10)\n\nPerimeter = 1 * 1024\n\nPerimeter = 1024 units"
