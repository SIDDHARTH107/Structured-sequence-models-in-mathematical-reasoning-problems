    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of $C$ and $L$, we need to solve the system of equations given by:\n\n$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ (Equation of curve $C$)\n$x + y + z = 0$ (Equation of line $L$)\n\nFrom the equation of line $L$, we can express $z$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:\n\n$z = -x - y$\n\nNow substitute this expression for $z$ into the equation of curve $C$:\n\n$x^3 + y^3 + (-x - y)^3 = 0$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$x^3 + y^3 - x^3 - 3x^2y - 3xy^2 - y^3 = 0$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$-3x^2y - 3xy^2 = 0$\n\nFactoring out a $-3xy$ term, we get:\n\n$-3xy(x + y) = 0$\n\nThis equation has three solutions:\n\n1) $x = 0$, which gives the point $[0:1:-1]$ on both $C$ and $L$.\n2) $y = 0$, which gives the point $[1:0:-1]$ on both $C$ and $L$.\n3) $x + y = 0$, which gives the point $[1:-1:0]$ on both $C$ and $L$.\n\nThus, there are three intersection points, and the degree of the intersection of $C$ and $L$ is 3."
