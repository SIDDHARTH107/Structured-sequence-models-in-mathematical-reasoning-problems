    "message_2": "To find an expression for f(z) in the lower half-plane Im(z) < 0 using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to define a function g(z) that is analytic in the lower half-plane and satisfies the same conditions as f(z) but with a simple pole at z = -ia.\n\nSince f(z) is real on the x-axis, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle to define g(z) as follows:\n\ng(z) = f*(z*) = f*(z̄)\n\nwhere z* is the complex conjugate of z, and f* is the complex conjugate of f.\n\nNow, we can find an expression for f(z) in the lower half-plane by considering the function h(z) = f(z) + g(z):\n\nh(z) = f(z) + f*(z̄)\n\nh(z) is analytic in the upper half-plane and the lower half-plane, except at the simple poles z = ia and z = -ia. Moreover, h(z) is real on the x-axis, since both f(z) and f*(z̄) are real on the x-axis.\n\nBy the Riemann mapping theorem, there exists a Möbius transformation T(z) that maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk, with T(ia) = 0. The function h(T(z)) is analytic in the unit disk, except at z = T(ia) = 0 and z = T(-ia). Since h(z) is real on the x-axis, h(T(z)) is real on the boundary of the unit disk.\n\nBy the Schwarz reflection principle, we can define a function H(z) in the unit disk as follows:\n\nH(z) = h(T(z)) + h*(T(z̄))\n\nH(z) is analytic in the unit disk, except at z = 0 and z = T(-ia). Since h(T(z)) and h*(T(z̄)) are real on the boundary of the unit disk, H(z) is real on the boundary of the unit disk.\n\nNow, we can find an expression for f(z) in the lower half-plane by considering the function F(z) = H(T^(-1)(z)):\n\nF(z) = H(T^(-1)(z)) = h(T^(-1)(z)) + h*(T^(-1)(z̄))\n\nF(z) is analytic in the upper half-plane and the lower half-plane, except at the simple poles z = ia and z = -ia. Moreover, F(z) is real on the x-axis, since both h(T^(-1)(z)) and h*(T^(-1)(z̄)) are real on the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, the expression for f(z) in the lower half-plane is given by:\n\nf(z) = F(z) - g(z) = h(T^(-1)(z)) - f*(T^(-1)(z̄))"
