First, we will compute the values of n and phi(n), where n = p*q. \n\na) What is the value of n? \n\nb) What is the value of phi(n)? \n\nNext, we will choose a random integer e such that 1<e<phi(n) and e is co-prime with phi(n). Let's assume that our random integer e is 7. We will then calculate the value of d, where d is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo phi(n). \n\nc) What is the value of d? \n\nFinally, we will encrypt our secret message m using the public key parameters (n,e). \n\nd) What is the ciphertext c obtained after encrypting our message m? \n\nNote: When computing the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo phi(n), if it does not exist, choose another value of e until a modular multiplicative inverse exists.",
    "message_2": "a) To find the value of n, we simply multiply p and q:\n\nn = p * q = 17 * 11 = 187\n\nb) To find the value of phi(n), we use the formula phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1):\n\nphi(n) = (17-1)(11-1) = 16 * 10 = 160\n\nc) We are given e = 7, and we need to find d such that (d * e) % phi(n) = 1. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse:\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 23, since (7 * 23) % 160 = 1.\n\nd) To encrypt the message m = 7 using the public key parameters (n, e), we compute the ciphertext c as follows:\n\nc = m^e % n = 7^7 % 187 = 823543 % 187 = 99\n\nSo, the ciphertext c obtained after encrypting the message m is 99."
