    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 in the field Z11, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible x and y values in the field Z11 and checking if the equation holds true. If it does, we count that point.\n\nHere's the process:\n\n1. Initialize a counter for the number of points to 1 (to account for the point at infinity).\n2. Iterate through all x values in Z11 (0 to 10).\n3. For each x value, calculate the right side of the equation (x^3 + 5x + 7) modulo 11.\n4. Check if there exists a y value in Z11 such that y^2 is congruent to the calculated value modulo 11.\n5. If such a y value exists, increment the counter by 2 (since there are two possible y values for each valid x value).\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Initialize counter: points = 1\n2. Iterate through x values in Z11:\n\n   x = 0: Right side = (0^3 + 5*0 + 7) % 11 = 7\n   y^2 = 7 has solutions y = 5 and y = 6, so points += 2\n\n   x = 1: Right side = (1^3 + 5*1 + 7) % 11 = 1\n   y^2 = 1 has solutions y = 1 and y = 10, so points += 2\n\n   x = 2: Right side = (2^3 + 5*2 + 7) % 11 = 6\n   y^2 = 6 has no solutions in Z11, so no points added\n\n   x = 3: Right side = (3^3 + 5*3 + 7) % 11 = 9\n   y^2 = 9 has solutions y = 3 and y = 8, so points += 2\n\n   x = 4: Right side = (4^3 + 5*4 + 7) % 11 = 4\n   y^2 = 4 has solutions y = 2 and y = 9, so points += 2\n\n   x = 5: Right side = (5^3 + 5*5 + 7) % 11 = 3\n   y^2 = 3 has no solutions in Z11, so no points added\n\n   x = 6: Right side = (6^3 + 5*6 + 7) % 11 = 8\n   y^2 = 8 has no solutions in Z11, so no points added\n\n   x = 7: Right side = (7^3 + 5*7 + 7) % 11 = 10\n   y^2 = 10 has solutions y = 4 and y = 7, so points += 2\n\n   x = 8: Right side = (8^3 + 5*8 + 7) % 11 = 5\n   y^2 = 5 has no solutions in Z11, so no points added\n\n   x = 9: Right side = (9^3 + 5*9 + 7) % 11 = 2\n   y^2 = 2 has solutions y = 6 and y = 5, so points += 2\n\n   x = 10: Right side = (10^3 + 5*10 + 7) % 11 = 0\n   y^2 = 0 has a solution y = 0, so points += 1 (only one solution for y^2 = 0)\n\nThe total number of points on the elliptic curve is 1 (point at infinity) + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 12.\n\nSo, the order of the elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 in the field Z11 is 12."
