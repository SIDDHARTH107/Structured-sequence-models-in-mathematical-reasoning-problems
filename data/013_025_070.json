    "message_1": "The Traveler's Dilemma involves two players who independently choose a number between 2 and 100. The player with the lower number gets a payoff equal to the number they chose, while the player with the higher number gets a payoff equal to the lowest number plus a bonus. The bonus is equal to 2 times the difference between the two choices. \n\nWrite down the payoff for each player if they choose 50.",
    "message_2": "If both players choose 50, their choices are equal, so there is no lower or higher number. In this case, both players receive the same payoff, which is equal to the number they chose. \n\nTherefore, the payoff for each player if they choose 50 is 50."
