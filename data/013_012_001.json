The market demand curve is Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price per unit. Firm 1 is the leader and sets its output quantity first, then Firm 2 follows. The cost function for each firm is C(q) = 10q, where q is the quantity produced by the firm. Determine the output levels and profits for each firm, assuming that they are rational and profit-maximizing.\n\nHint: To solve this problem, you'll need to use the concept of the Stackelberg equilibrium, where the leader (Firm 1) sets its quantity first, and the follower (Firm 2) chooses its quantity based on what the leader has chosen.",

Calculate the optimal output for Firm 2, given Firm 1's optimal output.\n4. Compute the profits for each firm.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for Firm 2\nFirm 2's profit function is given by:\nπ2 = TR2 - TC2\nwhere TR2 is total revenue and TC2 is total cost.\n\nTotal revenue for Firm 2 is given by:\nTR2 = P * q2\nSince Q = q1 + q2 and P = 50 - 0.5Q, we can rewrite TR2 as:\nTR2 = (50 - 0.5(q1 + q2)) * q2\n\nTotal cost for Firm 2 is given by:\nTC2 = 10q2\n\nNow, we can write the profit function for Firm 2:\nπ2 = (50 - 0.5(q1 + q2)) * q2 - 10q2\n\nTo find the reaction function, we need to maximize π2 with respect to q2. To do this, we will take the first derivative of π2 with respect to q2 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ2/dq2 = -0.5q1 + 40 - q2 = 0\n\nSolving for q2, we get Firm 2's reaction function:\nq2 = 40 - 0.5q1\n\nStep 2: Determine the optimal output for Firm 1, given Firm 2's reaction function\nFirm 1's profit function is given by:\nπ1 = TR1 - TC1\n\nTotal revenue for Firm 1 is given by:\nTR1 = P * q1\nSince P = 50 - 0.5Q, we can rewrite TR1 as:\nTR1 = (50 - 0.5(q1 + q2)) * q1\n\nTotal cost for Firm 1 is given by:\nTC1 = 10q1\n\nNow, we can write the profit function for Firm 1:\nπ1 = (50 - 0.5(q1 + q2)) * q1 - 10q1\n\nSubstitute Firm 2's reaction function into Firm 1's profit function:\nπ1 = (50 - 0.5(q1 + (40 - 0.5q1))) * q1 - 10q1\n\nSimplify the profit function:\nπ1 = (50 - 0.5q1 - 20 + 0.25q1) * q1 - 10q1\nπ1 = (30 - 0.25q1) * q1 - 10q1\n\nTo find the optimal output for Firm 1, we will take the first derivative of π1 with respect to q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ1/dq1 = 30 - 0.5q1 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for q1, we get the optimal output for Firm 1:\nq1 = 40\n\nStep 3: Calculate the optimal output for Firm 2, given Firm 1's optimal output\nUsing Firm 2's reaction function, we can find the optimal output for Firm 2:\nq2 = 40 - 0.5(40)\nq2 = 40 - 20\nq2 = 20\n\nStep 4: Compute the profits for each firm\nNow that we have the optimal output levels for both firms, we can calculate their profits.\n\nFor Firm 1:\nTR1 = P * q1 = (50 - 0.5(40 + 20)) * 40 = 20 * 40 = 800\nTC1 = 10q1 = 10 * 40 = 400\nπ1 = TR1 - TC1 = 800 - 400 = 400\n\nFor Firm 2:\nTR2 = P * q2 = (50 - 0.5(40 + 20)) * 20 = 20 * 20 = 400\nTC2 = 10q2 = 10 * 20 = 200\nπ2 = TR2 - TC2 = 400 - 200 = 200\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal output levels for Firm 1 and Firm 2 are 40 and 20, respectively. The profits for Firm 1 and Firm 2 are 400 and 200, respectively."
