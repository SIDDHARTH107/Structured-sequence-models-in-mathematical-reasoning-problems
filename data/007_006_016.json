    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 252 and 105 using the Euclidean algorithm, we'll perform a series of divisions and remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (252) by the smaller number (105) and find the remainder.\n   252 รท 105 = 2 with a remainder of 42.\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (105) and the smaller number with the remainder (42) from the previous step, and repeat the division.\n   105 รท 42 = 2 with a remainder of 21.\n\n3. Continue this process until the remainder is 0.\n   42 รท 21 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 21.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 105 is 21."
