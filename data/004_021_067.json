    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x), we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then differentiate it again to find the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nGiven function: f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 9)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 12\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 12)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12."
