    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} , B = {2, 3, 4}, and C = {3, 4, 5}.\nIf we first find the symmetric difference of A and B, then the symmetric difference of the result with set C, can you prove that the result is the same as the symmetric difference of B and C, then the symmetric difference of the result with set A?",
    "message_2": "To prove this, let's first define the symmetric difference of two sets. The symmetric difference of sets X and Y, denoted as X Δ Y, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, X Δ Y = (X ∪ Y) - (X ∩ Y).\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric differences as described in the problem:\n\n1. Symmetric difference of A and B: A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n2. Symmetric difference of the result with set C: (A Δ B) Δ C = ({1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5}) = {1, 3, 4, 5} - {4} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric differences in the other order:\n\n1. Symmetric difference of B and C: B Δ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {2, 5}\n2. Symmetric difference of the result with set A: (B Δ C) Δ A = ({2, 5} ∪ {1, 2, 3}) - ({2, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3}) = {1, 2, 3, 5} - {2} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nAs we can see, the results of both operations are the same: {1, 3, 5}. Therefore, we have proved that the symmetric difference of A and B, then the symmetric difference of the result with set C, is the same as the symmetric difference of B and C, then the symmetric difference of the result with set A."
