    "message_1": "Here's an example problem:\n\nIn relevance logic, we use a connective called \"relevant implication\" (⊸), which is truth-valued differently from classical implication. Let A and B be two statements such that A is relevant to B but not vice versa. If A is true and B is false, what is the truth value of \"A ⊸ B\"?",
    "message_2": "In relevance logic, the relevant implication (⊸) is designed to avoid the paradoxes of classical implication, where irrelevant premises can lead to true implications. The truth table for relevant implication (⊸) is as follows:\n\nA | B | A ⊸ B\n--|---|------\nT | T |   T\nT | F |   F\nF | T |   F\nF | F |   F\n\nGiven that A is true (T) and B is false (F), we can look at the truth table and see that the truth value of \"A ⊸ B\" is false (F)."
