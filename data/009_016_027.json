    "message_2": "To solve Laplace's equation in a rectangular region with the given boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let the potential V(x, y, z) be a function of x, y, and z coordinates. Laplace's equation is given by:\n\n∇²V = ∂²V/∂x² + ∂²V/∂y² + ∂²V/∂z² = 0\n\nWe assume a solution of the form V(x, y, z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z). Substituting this into Laplace's equation and dividing by V, we get:\n\n(1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) + (1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²) + (1/Z)(∂²Z/∂z²) = 0\n\nNow, we separate the variables:\n\n(1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) = -λ - µ\n(1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²) = λ\n(1/Z)(∂²Z/∂z²) = µ\n\nSolving these three ordinary differential equations with the given boundary conditions, we get the general solution for V(x, y, z):\n\nV(x, y, z) = ∑ ∑ ∑ (A_nmp * sin(nπx/L) * sin(mπy/W) * (B_nmp * cosh(pπz/H) + C_nmp * sinh(pπz/H)))\n\nwhere L = 4 cm, W = 3 cm, H = 2 cm, and λ = (nπ/L)², µ = (mπ/W)² - (nπ/L)², and n, m, p are positive integers.\n\nTo find the coefficients A_nmp, B_nmp, and C_nmp, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. V(x, y, 0) = 0\n2. V(x, y, H) = 30\n3. V(0, y, z) = 10\n4. V(L, y, z) = 15\n\nApplying these boundary conditions and solving for the coefficients, we can find the potential V(x, y, z) in the rectangular region. However, this process involves a lot of mathematical manipulations and is quite lengthy. It is usually done using mathematical software or numerical methods."
