So, AxB = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)}.\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of this set with C. Let's denote the elements of AxB as P, so we have P = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)}.\n\nNow, we find (AxB)xC, which is the set of all ordered pairs (p, c) where p is an element of P and c is an element of C.\n\n(AxB)xC = {((1, 4), 7), ((1, 4), 8), ((1, 5), 7), ((1, 5), 8), ((1, 6), 7), ((1, 6), 8), ((2, 4), 7), ((2, 4), 8), ((2, 5), 7), ((2, 5), 8), ((2, 6), 7), ((2, 6), 8), ((3, 4), 7), ((3, 4), 8), ((3, 5), 7), ((3, 5), 8), ((3, 6), 7), ((3, 6), 8)}"
