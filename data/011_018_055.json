Construct a design for the raffle that ensures that each ticket has a chance of winning any gift basket and any gift card, and each gift basket and gift card is given away the same number of times.",
    "message_2": "To ensure that each ticket has a chance of winning any gift basket and any gift card, and each gift basket and gift card is given away the same number of times, we can use a Latin square design.\n\nFirst, let's assign numbers to the gift baskets and gift cards:\n\nGift Baskets: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5\nGift Cards: C1, C2, C3, C4\n\nNow, we will create a 5x4 Latin rectangle, where each row represents a gift basket and each column represents a gift card. In this rectangle, each number from 1 to 4 appears once in each row and each column.\n\n```\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 1\n3 4 1 2\n4 1 2 3\n```\n\nNow, we will assign the gift baskets and gift cards to the numbers in the Latin rectangle:\n\n```\nB1C1 B1C2 B1C3 B1C4\nB2C2 B2C3 B2C4 B2C1\nB3C3 B3C4 B3C1 B3C2\nB4C4 B4C1 B4C2 B4C3\n```\n\nSince there are 20 tickets available for the raffle, we can distribute the tickets as follows:\n\n- 4 tickets for each of the 5 gift baskets (4 x 5 = 20)\n\nNow, we can assign the tickets to the gift baskets and gift cards combinations:\n\n```\nB1C1: 4 tickets\nB1C2: 4 tickets\nB1C3: 4 tickets\nB1C4: 4 tickets\nB2C2: 4 tickets\nB2C3: 4 tickets\nB2C4: 4 tickets\nB2C1: 4 tickets\nB3C3: 4 tickets\nB3C4: 4 tickets\nB3C1: 4 tickets\nB3C2: 4 tickets\nB4C4: 4 tickets\nB4C1: 4 tickets\nB4C2: 4 tickets\nB4C3: 4 tickets\n```\n\nThis design ensures that each ticket has a chance of winning any gift basket and any gift card, and each gift basket and gift card is given away the same number of times."
