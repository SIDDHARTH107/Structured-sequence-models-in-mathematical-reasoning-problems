    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x, we first need to find its first derivative, which will give us the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve. Then, we will find the points where the first derivative is equal to zero or undefined, as these are the critical points.\n\n1. Find the first derivative of f(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\n2. Find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is possible:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\n3. Check if the critical points are within the interval [0, 5]:\n\nBoth critical points, x = 1 and x = 3, are within the interval [0, 5].\n\nThus, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x within the interval [0, 5] are x = 1 and x = 3."
