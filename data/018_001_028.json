    "message_2": "To show that the empty set is a subset of A, we need to prove that every element in the empty set is also an element of A.\n\nThe empty set, denoted by âˆ…, has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A. By definition, this means that the empty set is a subset of A, since there are no elements in the empty set that would contradict this statement.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"every element in the empty set is also an element of A\" is vacuously true, as there are no elements in the empty set to begin with. Thus, the empty set is a subset of A."
