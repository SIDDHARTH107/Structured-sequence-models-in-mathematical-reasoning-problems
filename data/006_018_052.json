    "message_2": "To find the expected number of employees committing fraud, you can multiply the total number of employees by the probability of an employee committing fraud:\n\nExpected number of employees committing fraud = Total number of employees × Probability of committing fraud\n\nExpected number of employees committing fraud = 500 × 0.01\n\nExpected number of employees committing fraud = 5\n\nSo, the company would expect 5 employees to commit fraud."
