Also, calculate the absolute error at each grid point for the exact solution u(x,t) = sin(t)sin(x) + 1.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM) with n elements, we first need to discretize the domain and set up the weak form of the PDE.\n\n1. Discretize the domain:\nDivide the domain [0, π] into n equal intervals, with nodes x_i = iπ/n, i = 0, 1, ..., n. The size of each element is h = π/n.\n\n2. Set up the weak form of the PDE:\nMultiply the PDE by a test function v(x) and integrate over the domain. Then, integrate the second derivative term by parts to obtain the weak form:\n\n∫(∂u/∂t)v dx = 2∫(∂²u/∂x²)v dx + ∫3xv dx\n\n3. Discretize the weak form:\nApproximate the solution u(x,t) and the test function v(x) using piecewise linear basis functions:\n\nu(x,t) ≈ ∑[U_i(t)ϕ_i(x)]\nv(x) ≈ ∑[V_iϕ_i(x)]\n\nSubstitute the approximations into the weak form and apply the Galerkin method, which sets V_i = ϕ_i(x):\n\n∑[∫(∂U_i/∂t)ϕ_iϕ_j dx] = 2∑[∫(∂²U_i/∂x²)ϕ_iϕ_j dx] + ∫3xϕ_j dx\n\n4. Assemble the system of equations:\nThe above equation can be written in matrix form as:\n\nM * dU/dt = K * U + F\n\nwhere M, K, and F are the mass, stiffness, and force matrices, respectively. The elements of these matrices are given by:\n\nM_ij = ∫ϕ_iϕ_j dx\nK_ij = 2∫(∂ϕ_i/∂x)(∂ϕ_j/∂x) dx\nF_j = ∫3xϕ_j dx\n\n5. Apply the initial and boundary conditions:\nFor the initial condition, set U_i(0) = 1 for all i. For the boundary conditions, set U_0(t) = 0 and U_n(t) = sin(t).\n\n6. Solve the system of equations:\nUse a time-stepping method, such as the backward Euler method, to solve the system of equations for U_i(t) at each time step.\n\n7. Calculate the absolute error:\nCompute the exact solution u(x,t) = sin(t)sin(x) + 1 at each grid point (x_i, t_j) and compare it with the FEM solution U_i(t_j). The absolute error is given by:\n\nerror_ij = |u(x_i, t_j) - U_i(t_j)|\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the given PDE using the finite element method with n elements and calculate the absolute error at each grid point. Note that the actual implementation of these steps requires numerical integration and linear algebra techniques."
