    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and the length of its two parallel sides are 10 cm and 15 cm respectively. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call these sides a and b. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of these sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the base of the right triangles formed by the height and the two non-parallel sides. The difference between the parallel sides is 15 cm - 10 cm = 5 cm. Since there are two right triangles, the base of each right triangle is 5 cm / 2 = 2.5 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of sides a and b:\n\na^2 = (height)^2 + (base of right triangle)^2\na^2 = (8 cm)^2 + (2.5 cm)^2\na^2 = 64 cm^2 + 6.25 cm^2\na^2 = 70.25 cm^2\na = √(70.25 cm^2)\na ≈ 8.38 cm\n\nSince the trapezium is symmetrical, side b will have the same length as side a:\n\nb ≈ 8.38 cm\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 10 cm + 15 cm + 8.38 cm + 8.38 cm ≈ 41.76 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 41.76 cm."
