    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question about symplectic geometry:\n\nSuppose we have a symplectic manifold (M,ω) where M is a compact oriented surface of genus 2 with the standard orientation and ω is the standard symplectic form. Find the number of periodic orbits of a Hamiltonian function H:M→ℝ that is non-degenerate with respect to ω and has a simple critical point at the unique fixed point of the antipodal involution on M. \n\nNote: By \"number of periodic orbits,\" we mean the sum of the number of fixed points and twice the number of non-degenerate 1-periodic orbits in the Hamiltonian flow of H.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, which relates the sum of the indices of the critical points of a smooth function on a compact manifold to the Euler characteristic of the manifold.\n\nFirst, let's compute the Euler characteristic of the compact oriented surface M of genus 2. The Euler characteristic χ(M) of a surface of genus g is given by the formula:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a surface of genus 2, we have:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2(2) = -2\n\nNow, let's consider the Hamiltonian function H:M→ℝ. Since H is non-degenerate with respect to ω, all of its critical points are non-degenerate. Moreover, H has a simple critical point at the unique fixed point of the antipodal involution on M. Let's denote this fixed point by p.\n\nBy the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, the sum of the indices of the critical points of H is equal to the Euler characteristic of M:\n\nΣ index(critical points of H) = χ(M)\n\nSince p is a simple critical point, its index is either +1 or -1. Let's assume that the index of p is +1 (the case where the index is -1 can be treated similarly).\n\nNow, let's consider the other critical points of H. Each of these critical points corresponds to a periodic orbit of the Hamiltonian flow of H. Since H is non-degenerate, each of these periodic orbits is non-degenerate and has index +1 or -1.\n\nLet n_+ and n_- be the number of non-degenerate 1-periodic orbits with index +1 and -1, respectively. Then, the total number of periodic orbits is given by:\n\nN = 1 (fixed point p) + 2(n_+ + n_-)\n\nBy the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, we have:\n\n1 (index of p) + n_+ - n_- = -2\n\nSince the index of p is +1, we get:\n\nn_+ - n_- = -3\n\nNow, we want to find the total number of periodic orbits N. We have:\n\nN = 1 + 2(n_+ + n_-)\n\nUsing the equation n_+ - n_- = -3, we can solve for n_+ in terms of n_-:\n\nn_+ = n_- - 3\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for N, we get:\n\nN = 1 + 2((n_- - 3) + n_-) = 1 + 2(2n_- - 3)\n\nSince N must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible value for n_- is 2. In this case, we have:\n\nN = 1 + 2(2(2) - 3) = 1 + 2(1) = 3\n\nTherefore, there are at least 3 periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian function H."
