    "message_1": "A grocery store found that 80% of customers who purchase milk also buy bread. If the store had 200 customers who purchased milk this week, how many of those customers are expected to also purchase bread?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of customers who are expected to purchase both milk and bread, we can multiply the total number of customers who purchased milk by the percentage of customers who also buy bread.\n\n200 customers (who purchased milk) * 80% (who also buy bread) = 200 * 0.8 = 160 customers\n\nSo, 160 customers are expected to purchase both milk and bread."
