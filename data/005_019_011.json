    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The factory's Manager observed that 40% of the products produced are A, and 60% of the products produced are B. Additionally, they found that 10% of the products A are defective, and 5% of the products B are defective. Given that a product is defective, what is the probability that it is Type A?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:\n\nP(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)\n\nwhere P(A|D) is the probability that a product is Type A given that it is defective, P(D|A) is the probability that a product is defective given that it is Type A, P(A) is the probability that a product is Type A, and P(D) is the probability that a product is defective.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.4 (40% of products are Type A)\nP(B) = 0.6 (60% of products are Type B)\nP(D|A) = 0.1 (10% of Type A products are defective)\nP(D|B) = 0.05 (5% of Type B products are defective)\n\nTo find P(D), we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)\n\nP(D) = (0.1 * 0.4) + (0.05 * 0.6) = 0.04 + 0.03 = 0.07\n\nNow we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|D):\n\nP(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)\nP(A|D) = (0.1 * 0.4) / 0.07 = 0.04 / 0.07 â‰ˆ 0.5714\n\nSo, the probability that a product is Type A given that it is defective is approximately 0.5714 or 57.14%."
