    "message_2": "The phase shift of a cosine function in the form f(x) = A*cos(Bx - C) can be found by calculating the value of C/B. In this case, A = 2, B = 4, and C = π/3.\n\nPhase shift = C/B\nPhase shift = (π/3) / 4\nPhase shift = π/12\n\nThe phase shift of the given cosine function f(x) = 2cos(4x - π/3) is π/12."
