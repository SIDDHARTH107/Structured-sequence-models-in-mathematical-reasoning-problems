    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence of the given power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^{2(n+1)}}{(2(n+1))!}}{\\frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^{2n+2}(2n)!}{(-1)^n x^{2n}(2(n+1))!}\\right|$$\n\nCancel out the common terms:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(-1) x^2}{(2n+2)(2n+1)}\\right|$$\n\nSince the limit does not depend on n, we can remove the limit notation:\n\n$$\\frac{x^2}{(2n+2)(2n+1)} < 1$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the denominator grows without bound, and the inequality will always hold true. Therefore, the radius of convergence is infinite, meaning the power series converges for all values of x."
