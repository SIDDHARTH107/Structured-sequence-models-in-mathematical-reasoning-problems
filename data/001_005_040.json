    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 4, and c = -5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(1)(-5))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 20)) / 2\n\nx = (-4 ± √36) / 2\n\nx = (-4 ± 6) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (-4 + 6) / 2\nx = 2 / 2\nx = 1\n\n2) x = (-4 - 6) / 2\nx = -10 / 2\nx = -5\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0 are x = 1 and x = -5."
