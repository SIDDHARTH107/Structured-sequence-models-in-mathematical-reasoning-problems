    "message_2": "To find the value of x using the inverse trigonometric function, we can use the arcsin (also written as sin^(-1)) function. \n\nsin^(-1)(sin(x)) = sin^(-1)(0.5)\n\nx = sin^(-1)(0.5)\n\nx = 30° or π/6 radians\n\nKeep in mind that the sine function is periodic, so there are infinitely many solutions for x. The general solution can be expressed as:\n\nx = 30° + 360°n or π/6 + 2πn (for even values of n)\nx = 180° - 30° + 360°n or 5π/6 + 2πn (for odd values of n)\n\nwhere n is an integer."
