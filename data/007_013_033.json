    "message_2": "Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values, and it holds true for all tested cases. However, it remains unproven, so we cannot definitively say that there is no smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.\n\nIf Goldbach's conjecture is true, then there is no smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. If it is false, then there would be a smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, but we do not know what that number is."
