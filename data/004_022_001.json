    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular plot be x meters, and the width be 2x meters (since the width is twice the length). The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nSince we have 288 meters of fencing, we can write the equation as:\n\n288 = 2(x + 2x)\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n288 = 2(3x)\n288 = 6x\nx = 48 meters\n\nSo, the length of the plot is 48 meters, and the width is twice the length, which is:\n\nWidth = 2 * Length\nWidth = 2 * 48\nWidth = 96 meters\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the rectangular plot that can be enclosed with 288 meters of fencing and has the maximum area are 48 meters in length and 96 meters in width."
