    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n\nx + y + z = 6      (1)\n2x + 3y + 4z = 20  (2)\n4x + 5y + 6z = 36  (3)\n\nThe coefficient matrix A is:\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |\n    | 2  3  4 |\n    | 4  5  6 |\n\nNow, we perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 4  1  1 |\n\nU = | 1  1  1 |\n    | 0  1  2 |\n    | 0  0  1 |\n\nNow, we have the equation LUx = b, where b is the column matrix of constants:\n\nb = |  6  |\n    | 20  |\n    | 36  |\n\nFirst, we solve Ly = b for y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   |  6  |\n| 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 20  |\n| 4  1  1 | | y3 |   | 36  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 6\ny2 = 8\ny3 = 4\n\nNow, we solve Ux = y for x:\n\n| 1  1  1 | | x1 |   |  6  |\n| 0  1  2 | | x2 | = |  8  |\n| 0  0  1 | | x3 |   |  4  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx1 = 2\nx2 = 0\nx3 = 4\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of equations is x = 2, y = 0, and z = 4."
