    "message_1": "A factory has three machines that process a certain product. Machine 1 can produce 100 units per hour, machine 2 can produce 120 units per hour, and machine 3 can produce 90 units per hour. The factory must produce 5000 units of the product. What is the optimal way to schedule production among the machines to minimize the time required to complete the production?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the time required to complete the production, we should use all three machines simultaneously. \n\nLet's denote the time spent working for each machine as t1, t2, and t3 for machines 1, 2, and 3, respectively. \n\nThe total production can be represented as:\n100t1 + 120t2 + 90t3 = 5000\n\nSince we want to minimize the time required, we should make all three machines work for the same amount of time. Therefore, t1 = t2 = t3 = t.\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n100t + 120t + 90t = 5000\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n310t = 5000\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\nt = 5000 / 310\nt â‰ˆ 16.13 hours\n\nSo, the optimal way to schedule production among the machines is to have all three machines work simultaneously for approximately 16.13 hours."
