    "message_2": "S is both connected and path-connected.\n\nFirst, let's show that S is path-connected. To do this, we need to show that for any two points in S, there exists a continuous path between them. Let A = (x1, y1) and B = (x2, y2) be two arbitrary points in S. Since both points lie on the unit circle, we have x1^2 + y1^2 = 1 and x2^2 + y2^2 = 1.\n\nNow, consider the path γ(t) = (cos(θ1 + t(θ2 - θ1)), sin(θ1 + t(θ2 - θ1))), where t ∈ [0, 1], and θ1 and θ2 are the angles corresponding to points A and B, respectively, in polar coordinates. In other words, A = (cos(θ1), sin(θ1)) and B = (cos(θ2), sin(θ2)).\n\nThe path γ(t) is continuous, as the functions cos(θ1 + t(θ2 - θ1)) and sin(θ1 + t(θ2 - θ1)) are continuous with respect to t. Moreover, γ(0) = (cos(θ1), sin(θ1)) = A and γ(1) = (cos(θ2), sin(θ2)) = B, so the path connects points A and B.\n\nSince A and B were arbitrary points in S, we have shown that there exists a continuous path between any two points in S. Therefore, S is path-connected.\n\nNow, let's show that S is connected. Recall that a set is connected if it cannot be written as the union of two nonempty, disjoint, open sets. Since S is path-connected, it must also be connected. This is because if a set is path-connected, any two points in the set can be connected by a continuous path, and the image of a connected set under a continuous function is connected. In this case, the continuous paths between points in S are the continuous functions, and their images are subsets of S. Since these subsets are connected, S itself must be connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the set S is both connected and path-connected."
