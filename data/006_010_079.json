    "message_2": "Let's use conditional probability to solve this problem. We are given the following information:\n\n1. There are 1000 people in the population.\n2. 250 people are between the ages of 45-60.\n3. 75 people between the ages of 45-60 have been diagnosed with the disease.\n4. The overall probability of being affected by the disease in the entire population is 0.08.\n\nWe want to find the probability of having the disease given that a person is between the ages of 45-60. Let's denote the events as follows:\n\nA: A person is between the ages of 45-60.\nB: A person has been diagnosed with the disease.\n\nWe want to find P(B|A), which is the probability of having the disease given that a person is between the ages of 45-60. We can use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)\n\nFirst, let's find P(A). There are 250 people between the ages of 45-60 out of a total population of 1000, so:\n\nP(A) = 250 / 1000 = 0.25\n\nNext, let's find P(A ∩ B). There are 75 people between the ages of 45-60 who have been diagnosed with the disease, so:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = 75 / 1000 = 0.075\n\nNow we can find P(B|A):\n\nP(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) = 0.075 / 0.25 = 0.3\n\nSo, the probability that a person between the ages of 45-60 has been diagnosed with the disease is 0.3 or 30%."
