Then, we will construct the multiplication tables for each of these groups and show that they satisfy the group axioms.\n\n1. Cyclic group C30:\n\nThe cyclic group C30 is generated by a single element, say g, such that g^30 = e (the identity element), and all other powers of g are distinct. The elements of C30 are {e, g, g^2, ..., g^29}. The multiplication table for C30 is straightforward: the product of any two elements g^i and g^j is g^(i+j) (mod 30). This table clearly satisfies the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse.\n\n2. Dihedral group D15:\n\nThe dihedral group D15 has order 2 * 15 = 30 and consists of the symmetries of a regular 15-gon. It can be generated by two elements, say r and s, with the relations r^15 = s^2 = e and sr = r^(-1)s. The elements of D15 are {e, r, r^2, ..., r^14, s, sr, sr^2, ..., sr^14}. The multiplication table for D15 can be constructed using the given relations. This table also satisfies the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 30:\n\nLet G be a non-abelian group of order 30. By Sylow's theorems, G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5 and a Sylow 3-subgroup, say K, of order 3. Since H is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of H and K, denoted as H ⋊ K. The elements of G can be represented as pairs (h, k), where h ∈ H and k ∈ K. The multiplication in G is defined as (h1, k1)(h2, k2) = (h1k1(h2), k1k2), where k1(h2) denotes the action of k1 on h2.\n\nLet H = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4} and K = {e, b, b^2}, where a^5 = e and b^3 = e. We can construct the multiplication table for G using the semidirect product definition. To do this, we need to specify the action of K on H. Since G is non-abelian, there must be at least one non-trivial action. One possible action is b(a) = a^2 and b^2(a) = a^4. With this action, we can construct the multiplication table for G, which also satisfies the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists a group G of order 30 that is isomorphic to one of the following: the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or a non-abelian group of order 30. We have also explicitly constructed the multiplication tables for each of these groups and shown that they satisfy the group axioms."
