    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 2x - 1 between x = 1 and x = 5 using integration, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = 2x - 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\nâˆ«(2x - 1) dx = x^2 - x + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the given limits, x = 1 and x = 5:\n\nArea = [x^2 - x] (from 1 to 5)\n\nArea = (5^2 - 5) - (1^2 - 1)\n\nArea = (25 - 5) - (1 - 1)\n\nArea = 20\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 2x - 1 between x = 1 and x = 5 is 20 square units."
