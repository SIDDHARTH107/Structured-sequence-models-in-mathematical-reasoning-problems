    "message_1": "Consider a type theory system where there are 3 types: A, B, and C. Type A has 2 elements, type B has 3 elements, and type C has 4 elements. How many possible combinations of types can you create by choosing one or more of these types?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the number of possible combinations of types, we can use the principle of counting. For each type, we have two choices: either we include it in the combination or we don't. So, for each of the 3 types, we have 2 choices, which gives us a total of 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. However, this includes the case where we don't choose any of the types, which is not allowed. So, we subtract 1 from the total to account for this, giving us 8 - 1 = 7 possible combinations of types."
