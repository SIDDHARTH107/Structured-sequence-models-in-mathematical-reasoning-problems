    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos(3x) - 1 = 0, we first isolate the cosine term:\n\n2cos(3x) = 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\ncos(3x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose cosine is 1/2. We know that cos(π/3) = 1/2 and cos(5π/3) = 1/2. So, we have two possible values for 3x:\n\n3x = π/3 + 2πn or 3x = 5π/3 + 2πn, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x between 0 and 2π. Divide both sides of the equations by 3:\n\nx = π/9 + (2π/3)n or x = 5π/9 + (2π/3)n\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x between 0 and 2π by plugging in different integer values for n:\n\nFor the first equation (x = π/9 + (2π/3)n):\n\nn = 0: x = π/9 (This is between 0 and 2π)\nn = 1: x = π/9 + 2π/3 = 7π/9 (This is between 0 and 2π)\nn = 2: x = π/9 + 4π/3 = 13π/9 (This is greater than 2π, so we stop here)\n\nFor the second equation (x = 5π/9 + (2π/3)n):\n\nn = 0: x = 5π/9 (This is between 0 and 2π)\nn = 1: x = 5π/9 + 2π/3 = 11π/9 (This is between 0 and 2π)\nn = 2: x = 5π/9 + 4π/3 = 17π/9 (This is greater than 2π, so we stop here)\n\nSo, the solutions for x between 0 and 2π are:\n\nx = π/9, 7π/9, 5π/9, and 11π/9."
