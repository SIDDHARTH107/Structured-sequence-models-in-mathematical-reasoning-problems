    "message_2": "To find the linear equation that best fits the data, we will use the least squares method. First, we need to calculate the mean of the ages (x) and the mean of the weights (y).\n\nMean of ages (x̄) = (2 + 6 + 10 + 14) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8\nMean of weights (ȳ) = (12 + 18 + 22 + 24) / 4 = 76 / 4 = 19\n\nNext, we need to calculate the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the linear equation y = ax + b.\n\nTo find the slope (b), we use the formula:\n\nb = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n(2 - 8)(12 - 19) + (6 - 8)(18 - 19) + (10 - 8)(22 - 19) + (14 - 8)(24 - 19) = (-6)(-7) + (-2)(-1) + (2)(3) + (6)(5) = 42 + 2 + 6 + 30 = 80\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n(-6)^2 + (-2)^2 + (2)^2 + (6)^2 = 36 + 4 + 4 + 36 = 80\n\nNow, we can find the slope:\n\nb = 80 / 80 = 1\n\nTo find the y-intercept (a), we use the formula:\n\na = ȳ - b * x̄\n\na = 19 - 1 * 8 = 19 - 8 = 11\n\nSo, the linear equation that best fits the data is:\n\ny = 1x + 11\n\nNow, we can predict the weight of a child at 8 months of age using this equation:\n\ny = 1 * 8 + 11 = 8 + 11 = 19\n\nThe predicted weight of a child at 8 months of age is 19 pounds."
