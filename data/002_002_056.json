    "message_2": "The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nGiven the radius r = 6 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3)π(6^3)\nV = (4/3)π(216)\nV = 288π\n\nNow, we can approximate π as 3.1416 and multiply it by 288:\n\nV ≈ 288 * 3.1416\nV ≈ 904.7808\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the volume of the sphere is approximately 905 cubic centimeters."
