Now, let's prove that this intersection is a subset of both sets A and B.\n\nTo prove that a set C is a subset of a set D, we need to show that every element in C is also an element in D.\n\nIn this case, our set C is the intersection of A and B, which is {6}. We need to show that 6 is an element of both sets A and B.\n\n6 is an element of set A because it is an even number between 1 and 10. It is also an element of set B because it is a multiple of 3 between 1 and 15.\n\nSince 6 is an element of both sets A and B, we can conclude that the intersection of sets A and B, {6}, is a subset of both sets A and B."
