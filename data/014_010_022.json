    "message_1": "If we use a monoalphabetic substitution cipher to encrypt a message composed of 100 characters, and we have a key consisting of 26 letters, how many possible ways can this message be encrypted?",
    "message_2": "In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter from the key. Since there are 26 letters in the key, each character in the message can be encrypted in 26 different ways. \n\nFor a message of 100 characters, each character has 26 possibilities. To find the total number of possible ways to encrypt the entire message, we raise the number of possibilities for each character (26) to the power of the number of characters in the message (100).\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to encrypt the message is:\n\n26^100 ≈ 3.142 × 10^141"
