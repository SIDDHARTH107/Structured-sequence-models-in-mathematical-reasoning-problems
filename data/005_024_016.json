If another survey of 200 students resulted in 125 students preferring chocolate ice cream, what percentage of students preferred vanilla ice cream in the second survey?",
    "message_2": "In the second survey, there were 200 students in total, and 125 of them preferred chocolate ice cream. To find out how many students preferred vanilla ice cream, we subtract the number of students who preferred chocolate ice cream from the total number of students:\n\n200 students (total) - 125 students (chocolate) = 75 students (vanilla)\n\nNow, to find the percentage of students who preferred vanilla ice cream, we divide the number of students who preferred vanilla ice cream by the total number of students and multiply by 100:\n\n(75 students (vanilla) / 200 students (total)) * 100 = 37.5%\n\nSo, 37.5% of students preferred vanilla ice cream in the second survey."
