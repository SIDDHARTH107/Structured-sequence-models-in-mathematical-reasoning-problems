    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = 1/(s - 2i), we will use the Bromwich integral (also known as the inverse Laplace transform formula):\n\nf(t) = L^(-1){F(s)} = (1/2πi) * ∫(e^(st) * F(s) ds) from γ - i∞ to γ + i∞\n\nwhere γ is a real number greater than the real part of all singularities of F(s).\n\nIn our case, F(s) = 1/(s - 2i), and the singularity is at s = 2i. Therefore, we can choose γ > 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the integral:\n\nf(t) = (1/2πi) * ∫(e^(st) * 1/(s - 2i) ds) from γ - i∞ to γ + i∞\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we will use the residue theorem. First, we need to find the residues of the function e^(st) * 1/(s - 2i) at its singularities. In this case, there is only one singularity at s = 2i.\n\nThe residue of e^(st) * 1/(s - 2i) at s = 2i is given by:\n\nResidue = lim (s→2i) [(s - 2i) * e^(st) * 1/(s - 2i)] = e^(2it)\n\nNow, we can apply the residue theorem:\n\nf(t) = (1/2πi) * 2πi * e^(2it)\n\nThe 2πi terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nf(t) = e^(2it)\n\nSo, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = 1/(s - 2i) is f(t) = e^(2it)."
