    "message_1": "Suppose we have two functions f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x and g(x) = x^3 - 2x. Using the product rule, what is the derivative of the function h(x) = f(x) * g(x)?",
    "message_2": "To find the derivative of h(x) = f(x) * g(x), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of the product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nh'(x) = f'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x)\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x):\n\nf(x) = 3x^2 + 2x\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\ng(x) = x^3 - 2x\ng'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\nh'(x) = (6x + 2) * (x^3 - 2x) + (3x^2 + 2x) * (3x^2 - 2)\n\nNow, let's expand the terms:\n\nh'(x) = 6x(x^3) - 12x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x + 9x^4 - 6x^2 + 6x^3 - 4x^2\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nh'(x) = 9x^4 + 8x^3 - 22x^2 - 2x\n\nSo, the derivative of h(x) = f(x) * g(x) is h'(x) = 9x^4 + 8x^3 - 22x^2 - 2x."
