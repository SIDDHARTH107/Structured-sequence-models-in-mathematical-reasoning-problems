The De Rham cohomology group $H_{\\text{dR}}^2(M)$ is isomorphic to the space of equivalence classes of closed $2$-forms on $M$, where two closed $2$-forms are equivalent if their difference is exact. Suppose that $[\\omega]$ is a non-zero element of $H_{\\text{dR}}^2(M)$ and that $[\\omega]$ is not the class of an exact $2$-form. Prove that there exists a submanifold $N \\subseteq M$ such that $\\int_N \\omega \\neq 0$. \n\nDetermine the value of $\\int_N \\omega$ for the following specific case: Let $M = \\mathbb{RP}^3$ be the real projective $3$-space, and let $\\omega$ be the closed $2$-form on $M$ given by \n$$\\omega = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2} [\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y + (2z\\,\\mathrm{d}x - 2x\\,\\mathrm{d}z) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}z + (2y\\,\\mathrm{d}x - 2x\\,\\mathrm{d}y) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}z + \\mathrm{d}y \\wedge \\mathrm{d}z],$$\nwhere $[x:y:z]$ are homogeneous coordinates on $\\mathbb{RP}^3$.",
    "message_2": "Since $[\\omega]$ is a non-zero element of $H_{\\text{dR}}^2(M)$ and is not the class of an exact $2$-form, there exists a closed $2$-form $\\omega'$ such that $\\omega - \\omega'$ is not exact. By the Poincar√© duality, there exists a $1$-dimensional submanifold $N \\subseteq M$ such that $\\int_N (\\omega - \\omega') \\neq 0$. Since $\\omega'$ is closed, we have $\\int_N \\omega' = 0$. Therefore, we have $\\int_N \\omega = \\int_N (\\omega - \\omega') \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case where $M = \\mathbb{RP}^3$ and $\\omega$ is given by the expression above. We will compute the integral of $\\omega$ over a $1$-dimensional submanifold $N \\subseteq M$. Let $N$ be the projective line defined by the homogeneous coordinates $[x:y:z] = [t:0:1]$, where $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This submanifold can be parametrized by the map $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{RP}^3$, $\\varphi(t) = [t:0:1]$. The pullback of $\\omega$ by $\\varphi$ is given by\n$$\\varphi^*\\omega = \\frac{1}{1 + t^2} [\\mathrm{d}t \\wedge 0 + (2 - 2t^2) \\mathrm{d}t \\wedge 0 + (0 - 2t) \\mathrm{d}t \\wedge 0 + 0 \\wedge 0] = -\\frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \\mathrm{d}t.$$\n\nNow, we compute the integral of $\\varphi^*\\omega$ over $\\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\varphi^*\\omega = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} -\\frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \\mathrm{d}t.$$\n\nThis integral converges and can be computed using the substitution $u = t^2 + 1$, $\\mathrm{d}u = 2t\\,\\mathrm{d}t$:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} -\\frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{1}^{\\infty} -\\frac{1}{u} \\mathrm{d}u = -\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} [\\ln u]_1^b = -\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} (\\ln b - \\ln 1) = -\\infty.$$\n\nSince the integral of $\\omega$ over the submanifold $N$ is not zero, we have found a submanifold $N \\subseteq M$ such that $\\int_N \\omega \\neq 0$. In this specific case, the value of the integral is $-\\infty$."
