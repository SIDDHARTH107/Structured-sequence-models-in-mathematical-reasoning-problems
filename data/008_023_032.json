    "message_1": "Suppose you have a system of linear equations with 3 unknowns x, y and z as follows:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 10\nx - 2y + 4z = 5\n5x + y - 3z = 8\n\nHowever, the data for the second equation is noisy and has an error of 3. Find the values of x, y and z that satisfy the system of equations.",
    "message_2": "Since the second equation has an error of 3, we can consider two cases: the actual value of the equation is either 5 - 3 = 2 or 5 + 3 = 8. We will solve the system of equations for both cases and see if there is a valid solution.\n\nCase 1: The actual value of the second equation is 2.\nThe system of equations becomes:\n2x + 3y - z = 10\nx - 2y + 4z = 2\n5x + y - 3z = 8\n\nWe can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. Multiply the second equation by 5 and the third equation by -1 to make the coefficients of x equal:\n\n10x - 10y + 20z = 10\n-5x - y + 3z = -8\n\nNow, add these two equations to eliminate x:\n\n(-10y + 20z) + (-y + 3z) = 10 - 8\n-11y + 23z = 2\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from the first and third equations. Multiply the first equation by -5 and the third equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x equal:\n\n-10x - 15y + 5z = -50\n10x + 2y - 6z = 16\n\nNow, add these two equations to eliminate x:\n\n(-15y + 5z) + (2y - 6z) = -50 + 16\n-13y - z = -34\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, y and z:\n\n-11y + 23z = 2\n-13y - z = -34\n\nMultiply the second equation by 23 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n-11y + 23z = 2\n-299y - 23z = -782\n\nNow, add these two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(-11y + 23z) + (-299y - 23z) = 2 - 782\n-310y = -780\n\nNow, divide both sides by -310:\n\ny = 2.5\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the equation -13y - z = -34:\n\n-13(2.5) - z = -34\n-32.5 - z = -34\nz = 1.5\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation 2x + 3y - z = 10:\n\n2x + 3(2.5) - 1.5 = 10\n2x + 7.5 - 1.5 = 10\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nSo, for Case 1, the solution is x = 2, y = 2.5, and z = 1.5.\n\nCase 2: The actual value of the second equation is 8.\nThe system of equations becomes:\n2x + 3y - z = 10\nx - 2y + 4z = 8\n5x + y - 3z = 8\n\nRepeat the elimination process as in Case 1:\n\nFirst, eliminate x from the second and third equations:\n\n10x - 10y + 20z = 40\n-5x - y + 3z = -8\n\nAdd these two equations to eliminate x:\n\n(-10y + 20z) + (-y + 3z) = 40 - 8\n-11y + 23z = 32\n\nNext, eliminate x from the first and third equations:\n\n-10x - 15y + 5z = -50\n10x + 2y - 6z = 16\n\nAdd these two equations to eliminate x:\n\n(-15y + 5z) + (2y - 6z) = -50 + 16\n-13y - z = -34\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, y and z:\n\n-11y + 23z = 32\n-13y - z = -34\n\nMultiply the second equation by 23 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n-11y + 23z = 32\n-299y - 23z = -782\n\nAdd these two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(-11y + 23z) + (-299y - 23z) = 32 - 782\n-310y = -750\n\nNow, divide both sides by -310:\n\ny = 2.419\n\nSince y is not an integer, this solution is not valid for the given problem.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for the system of equations is x = 2, y = 2.5, and z = 1.5."
