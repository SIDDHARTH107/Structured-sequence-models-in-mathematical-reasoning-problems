    "message_2": "The probability of an event not occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event occurring. In this case, the probability of heavy rain is 20%, or 0.20 as a decimal. \n\nSo, the probability of it not raining heavily is:\n\n1 - 0.20 = 0.80\n\nTherefore, there is an 80% chance that it will not rain heavily on a given day in the city."
