    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nThe antiderivative F(x) is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x^2 - 4x + 5) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\n∫(3x^2) dx = (3/3) x^3 + C1 = x^3 + C1\n\n∫(-4x) dx = (-4/2) x^2 + C2 = -2x^2 + C2\n\n∫(5) dx = 5x + C3\n\nNow, we will add the results of the three integrals:\n\nF(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + (C1 + C2 + C3)\n\nSince C1, C2, and C3 are constants of integration, we can combine them into a single constant, C:\n\nF(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 is F(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + C."
