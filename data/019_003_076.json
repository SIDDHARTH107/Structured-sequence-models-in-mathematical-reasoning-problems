    "message_2": "Modal logic is a type of formal logic that deals with the concepts of necessity and possibility. However, it is not the appropriate tool to determine probabilities. Instead, we can use basic probability theory to solve this problem.\n\nIn this case, there are only two possible outcomes: the ball is either red or blue. Assuming there is no additional information or bias in the selection process, both outcomes are equally likely. Therefore, the probability that the ball is red can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability (Red) = Number of favorable outcomes (Red) / Total number of possible outcomes\n\nThere is only one favorable outcome (the ball being red) and two possible outcomes (the ball being either red or blue). So, the probability that the ball is red is:\n\nProbability (Red) = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%"
