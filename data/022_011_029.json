    "message_2": "(a) To find the zeros of the function, we need to solve the equation $z^3 - 1 = 0$. Using the fact that $z^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)$, we have:\n\n1. $z = 1$ (outside the unit circle)\n2. $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$\n\nFor the second equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\nThe two solutions are $z = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ and $z = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$, both of which are within the unit circle.\n\nSo, the zeros of the function within the unit circle are $z = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ and $z = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$.\n\n(b) To find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator $z^2 + z = 0$. Factoring, we get $z(z + 1) = 0$. Thus, the poles are $z = 0$ and $z = -1$, both of which are within the unit circle.\n\n(c) The order of each zero and pole can be determined by the multiplicity of the corresponding factor in the numerator and denominator. In this case, the order of the zero at $z = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ is 1, the order of the zero at $z = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ is 1, the order of the pole at $z = 0$ is 1, and the order of the pole at $z = -1$ is 1.\n\n(d) To find the Laurent series of $f(z)$ about $z = 0$, we can perform long division on the numerator and denominator:\n\n$\\frac{z^3 - 1}{z^2 + z} = \\frac{(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)}{z(z + 1)} = \\frac{z^2 + z + 1}{z} - \\frac{z^2 + z + 1}{z + 1}$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series for each term:\n\n1. $\\frac{z^2 + z + 1}{z} = z + 1 + \\frac{1}{z}$\n\n2. $\\frac{z^2 + z + 1}{z + 1} = 1 + (z - 1) + (z - 1)^2 + \\cdots = 1 + (z - 1) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + \\cdots$\n\nSubtracting the second series from the first, we get:\n\n$f(z) = z + 1 + \\frac{1}{z} - (1 + (z - 1) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + \\cdots) = \\frac{1}{z} - z^2 + 2z - 1 + \\cdots$\n\nThe Laurent series of $f(z)$ about $z = 0$ is:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} - z^2 + 2z - 1 + \\cdots$\n\nThe region of convergence for this Laurent series is the annulus $0 < |z| < \\infty$, since the series converges for all $z$ except at the poles $z = 0$ and $z = -1$."
