If $f(1+i) = 2$, find $f(2+i)$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the conjugate of the given point $1+i$. The conjugate of $1+i$ is $1-i$. Since $f(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$, we have:\n\n$$f(1-i) = \\overline{f(1+i)} = \\overline{2} = 2$$\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(z) = f(z) - f(1-i)$. This function is also analytic on the lower half plane with $\\text{Im}(z) < 0$ and has the same properties as $f(z)$. Moreover, $g(1-i) = 0$.\n\nUsing the Schwarz reflection principle, we can extend $g(z)$ to an entire function on the complex plane. The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a region and continuous on the boundary of that region, then it can be reflected across the boundary and still be analytic.\n\nIn this case, we can reflect $g(z)$ across the real axis to obtain an entire function $h(z)$ such that $h(z) = g(z)$ for $\\text{Im}(z) < 0$ and $h(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{g(z)}$ for $\\text{Im}(z) > 0$. Since $g(z)$ is continuous on the real axis, $h(z)$ is also continuous on the real axis.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $k(z) = h(z) - h(1+z)$. This function is also entire and satisfies $k(z) = 0$ for $\\text{Im}(z) < 0$. By the identity theorem, an entire function that is zero on a set with an accumulation point must be identically zero. Therefore, $k(z) = 0$ for all $z$.\n\nThus, we have $h(z) = h(1+z)$ for all $z$. In particular, for $z = 1+i$, we have:\n\n$$h(1+i) = h(2+i)$$\n\nSince $h(z) = g(z)$ for $\\text{Im}(z) < 0$, we have:\n\n$$g(1+i) = g(2+i)$$\n\nRecall that $g(z) = f(z) - f(1-i)$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$f(1+i) - f(1-i) = f(2+i) - f(1-i)$$\n\nWe are given that $f(1+i) = 2$ and $f(1-i) = 2$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n$$2 - 2 = f(2+i) - 2$$\n\nSolving for $f(2+i)$, we find:\n\n$$f(2+i) = 2$$"
