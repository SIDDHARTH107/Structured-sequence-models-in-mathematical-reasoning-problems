    "message_2": "To ensure that at least 3 people shake hands with each other, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. We will distribute the handshakes among the people in such a way that no two people shake hands with each other more than once.\n\nLet's assume that the minimum number of handshakes required is x. We will distribute these x handshakes among the 6 people, such that at least one person shakes hands with at least 3 people.\n\nIf we distribute the handshakes evenly among the 6 people, each person will shake hands with x/6 people. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if we want to ensure that at least one person shakes hands with at least 3 people, we need to have:\n\nx/6 >= 3\n\nx >= 18\n\nSo, the minimum number of handshakes required is 18."
