    "message_1": "A math student wants to determine the pattern in a sequence of numbers { 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }. Using inductive logic, what is the next number in the sequence?",
    "message_2": "By observing the given sequence {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}, we can see that each number is increasing by 2. This suggests an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. Using inductive logic, we can predict that the next number in the sequence will also increase by 2. \n\nSo, the next number in the sequence is 8 + 2 = 10."
