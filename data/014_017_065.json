    "message_1": "In a ciphertext encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, if the most frequent letter is E, and its frequency is 0.12, what is the expected frequency of the letter A in the ciphertext, assuming that the frequency distribution of the plaintext letters is the same as in English language?",
    "message_2": "In the English language, the frequency of the letter E is approximately 0.127, and the frequency of the letter A is approximately 0.082. Since the frequency of E in the ciphertext is 0.12, we can assume that the frequency distribution of the plaintext letters is roughly the same as in the English language.\n\nIn a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a fixed letter in the ciphertext. Therefore, the frequency of a letter in the ciphertext should be the same as the frequency of the corresponding letter in the plaintext.\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the letter A in the ciphertext would be approximately the same as its frequency in the plaintext, which is 0.082 or 8.2%."
