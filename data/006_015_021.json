    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the company experiencing another hacking attempt in the next week, we can use the Bernoulli trial model. Let's assume that the probability of a hacking attempt in a week is independent of the previous weeks.\n\nLet X be the number of hacking attempts in the next week. We want to find P(X ≥ 1), which is the probability of at least one hacking attempt.\n\nSince there are only two possible outcomes (either a hacking attempt occurs or it doesn't), we can use the complementary probability rule:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nHere, P(X = 0) is the probability of no hacking attempts in the next week.\n\nGiven the probability of a hacking attempt is 0.1, the probability of no hacking attempt is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nAssuming the hacking attempts are independent and occur with the same probability each day, we can model the probability of no hacking attempts in a week as:\n\nP(X = 0) = (0.9)^7\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.4783\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one hacking attempt:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - 0.4783\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 0.5217\n\nSo, the probability that the company will experience another hacking attempt in the next week is approximately 0.5217 or 52.17%."
