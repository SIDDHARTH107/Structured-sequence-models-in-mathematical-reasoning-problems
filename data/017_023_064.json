    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find the possible group structures. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to find the possible structures of Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n1. P_2 is isomorphic to Z_8 (cyclic group of order 8)\n2. P_2 is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 2)\n3. P_2 is isomorphic to D_8 (dihedral group of order 8)\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n1. P_3 is isomorphic to Z_9 (cyclic group of order 9)\n2. P_3 is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3 and 3)\n\nNow, we will consider the possible semi-direct products of these Sylow subgroups. We will denote the semi-direct product as ⋊.\n\n1. Z_8 ⋊ Z_9: This is a non-abelian group since Z_8 and Z_9 are both abelian. There is only one possible semi-direct product in this case, as there is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_9 to Aut(Z_8) (which has order 2). So, we have one non-abelian group here.\n\n2. Z_4 x Z_2 ⋊ Z_9: There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_9 to Aut(Z_4 x Z_2) (which has order 2). So, we have one non-abelian group here.\n\n3. D_8 ⋊ Z_9: There is no non-trivial homomorphism from Z_9 to Aut(D_8) (which has order 8), so there is no non-abelian group in this case.\n\n4. Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_3 x Z_3 to Aut(Z_8) (which has order 2). So, we have two non-abelian groups here.\n\n5. Z_4 x Z_2 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_3 x Z_3 to Aut(Z_4 x Z_2) (which has order 2). So, we have two non-abelian groups here.\n\n6. D_8 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3: There is no non-trivial homomorphism from Z_3 x Z_3 to Aut(D_8) (which has order 8), so there is no non-abelian group in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nFor each of these groups, we can provide an isomorphism by specifying the semi-direct product action:\n\n1. Z_8 ⋊ Z_9: The action is given by the non-trivial homomorphism from Z_9 to Aut(Z_8).\n2. Z_4 x Z_2 ⋊ Z_9: The action is given by the non-trivial homomorphism from Z_9 to Aut(Z_4 x Z_2).\n3. Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3 (first group): The action is given by the first non-trivial homomorphism from Z_3 x Z_3 to Aut(Z_8).\n4. Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3 (second group): The action is given by the second non-trivial homomorphism from Z_3 x Z_3 to Aut(Z_8).\n5. Z_4 x Z_2 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3 (first group): The action is given by the first non-trivial homomorphism from Z_3 x Z_3 to Aut(Z_4 x Z_2).\n6. Z_4 x Z_2 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3 (second group): The action is given by the second non-trivial homomorphism from Z_3 x Z_3 to Aut(Z_4 x Z_2)."
