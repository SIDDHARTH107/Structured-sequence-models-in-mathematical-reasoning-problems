    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. After each iteration, the total length of the curve doubles.\n\nLet's calculate the total length after 8 iterations:\n\n1. After the 1st iteration: 1 * 2 = 2 units\n2. After the 2nd iteration: 2 * 2 = 4 units\n3. After the 3rd iteration: 4 * 2 = 8 units\n4. After the 4th iteration: 8 * 2 = 16 units\n5. After the 5th iteration: 16 * 2 = 32 units\n6. After the 6th iteration: 32 * 2 = 64 units\n7. After the 7th iteration: 64 * 2 = 128 units\n8. After the 8th iteration: 128 * 2 = 256 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon Curve after 8 iterations is 256 units."
