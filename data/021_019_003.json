    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is a stochastic search algorithm that mimics the process of finding a better harmony by adjusting the pitches of the instruments. In the context of optimization problems, the pitches represent the decision variables, and the harmony represents the objective function value.\n\nTo apply the HS algorithm to the given optimization problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the problem parameters:\n   - Decision variable bounds: x_min = -1, x_max = 5\n   - Objective function: f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6\n   - Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solution vectors in the harmony memory (e.g., 10)\n   - Harmony Memory Considering Rate (HMCR): The probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.9)\n   - Pitch Adjusting Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting the pitch of a selected value (e.g., 0.3)\n   - Number of improvisations (NI): The number of iterations to perform (e.g., 1000)\n\n2. Initialize the harmony memory (HM) with random solutions within the bounds.\n\n3. Improvise a new harmony (solution) as follows:\n   - For each decision variable (x), generate a random number r.\n   - If r <= HMCR, select a value from the HM for the variable.\n   - If r <= PAR, adjust the pitch of the selected value by adding or subtracting a small random amount.\n   - Ensure the new value is within the bounds.\n\n4. Evaluate the new harmony using the objective function f(x).\n\n5. Update the harmony memory:\n   - If the new harmony is better than the worst harmony in the HM, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the specified number of improvisations (NI).\n\n7. The best harmony in the HM represents the global minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x.\n\nNote that the HS algorithm is a stochastic algorithm, and the results may vary between different runs. To obtain a more reliable result, you can run the algorithm multiple times and take the average or the best solution found.\n\nDue to the stochastic nature of the algorithm and the fact that it is not possible to provide a step-by-step solution, we cannot provide a specific answer for the global minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x. However, you can implement the algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB and run it to find the solution."
