Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the equation:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, K = 5000, P0 = 2500, r = 0.1, and t = 5. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + (5000 - 2500) / 2500 * e^(-0.1*5))\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + 2500 / 2500 * e^(-0.5))\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + 1 * e^(-0.5))\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + e^(-0.5))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-0.5) and then find the population P(5).\n\ne^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + 0.6065)\n\nP(5) = 5000 / 1.6065\n\nP(5) ≈ 3111.82\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the population of rabbits on the island in 5 years will be approximately 3112."
