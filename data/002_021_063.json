    "message_2": "To find the area of one piece of pizza, we first need to find the area of the entire pizza and then divide it by the number of pieces.\n\nThe area of a circle can be found using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the pizza is 12 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 6 inches.\n\nA = π(6)^2\nA ≈ 3.14 × 36\nA ≈ 113.04 square inches\n\nNow, we need to divide the total area by the number of pieces, which is 8.\n\nArea of one piece ≈ 113.04 ÷ 8\nArea of one piece ≈ 14.13 square inches\n\nSo, the area of one piece of pizza is approximately 14.13 square inches."
