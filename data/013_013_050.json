    "message_1": "Consider an auction where 4 bidders are vying for a painting. Each bidder has their own estimated value for the painting as follows: Bidder 1 - $3000, Bidder 2 - $4500, Bidder 3 - $6000, and Bidder 4 - $7500. The auctioneer decides to use a second-price sealed-bid auction (Vickrey auction). What will be the final selling price of the painting and which bidder will win the auction?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction (Vickrey auction), the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the price submitted by the second-highest bidder.\n\nIn this case, the bids are as follows:\nBidder 1 - $3000\nBidder 2 - $4500\nBidder 3 - $6000\nBidder 4 - $7500\n\nBidder 4 has the highest bid at $7500, so they will win the auction. However, they will pay the price submitted by the second-highest bidder, which is Bidder 3 with a bid of $6000.\n\nSo, the final selling price of the painting will be $6000, and Bidder 4 will win the auction."
