    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the first cohomology group $H^1(C, L)$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle $L$ on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\dim H^0(C, L) - \\dim H^1(C, L) = \\deg L + 1 - g.\n$$\n\nHere, $H^0(C, L)$ is the space of global sections of the line bundle $L$, and $\\deg L$ is the degree of the line bundle $L$. The genus $g$ of the curve $C$ can be computed using the degree $d$ of the curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ as follows:\n\n$$\ng = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}.\n$$\n\nNow, we want to compute $\\dim H^1(C, L)$. To do this, we first need to find $\\dim H^0(C, L)$. By Serre duality, we have:\n\n$$\n\\dim H^1(C, L) = \\dim H^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1}),\n$$\n\nwhere $K_C$ is the canonical bundle on $C$. The canonical bundle on a smooth projective curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ has degree $K_C = 3(d-1)$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\n\\dim H^1(C, L) = \\dim H^0(C, (3(d-1) - \\deg L) \\cdot L).\n$$\n\nNow, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem to the line bundle $(3(d-1) - \\deg L) \\cdot L$:\n\n$$\n\\dim H^0(C, (3(d-1) - \\deg L) \\cdot L) - \\dim H^1(C, (3(d-1) - \\deg L) \\cdot L) = (3(d-1) - \\deg L) + 1 - g.\n$$\n\nSince we are interested in the case when $L$ has no global sections, i.e., $\\dim H^0(C, L) = 0$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\dim H^1(C, L) = (3(d-1) - \\deg L) + 1 - g.\n$$\n\nFinally, plugging in the expression for the genus $g$ in terms of the degree $d$, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\dim H^1(C, L) = (3(d-1) - \\deg L) + 1 - \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}.\n$$\n\nThis is the dimension of the first cohomology group $H^1(C, L)$ in terms of the values of $d$ and the degree of $L$."
