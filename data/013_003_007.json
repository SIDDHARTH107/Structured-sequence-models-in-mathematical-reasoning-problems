    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem on the Ultimatum Game for a math student to solve:\n\nIn an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given $10 to split with Player 2. Player 1 proposes a division of the $10 and Player 2 either accepts or rejects the offer. If Player 2 accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If Player 2 rejects, both players receive nothing. What is the smallest amount that Player 2 must be offered, such that they will accept the offer at least 70% of the time?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot provide an exact numerical answer to this question because the Ultimatum Game is a psychological and economic experiment, and the acceptance rate depends on the behavior of the individuals involved. However, I can provide some insights based on the general principles of the game.\n\nIn the Ultimatum Game, the rational strategy for Player 2 would be to accept any offer greater than $0, as receiving something is better than receiving nothing. However, in practice, people tend to reject offers they perceive as unfair.\n\nTo determine the smallest amount that Player 2 must be offered such that they will accept the offer at least 70% of the time, you would need to conduct an experiment with a large number of participants and analyze the results. The acceptance rate will vary depending on the population and their perception of fairness.\n\nIn general, offers closer to an even split (e.g., $5 for each player) are more likely to be accepted, while offers that heavily favor Player 1 (e.g., $9 for Player 1 and $1 for Player 2) are more likely to be rejected. To achieve a 70% acceptance rate, the offer would likely need to be somewhere between these two extremes, but the exact amount would depend on the specific population being studied."
