    "message_2": "To find the values of $z$ that satisfy the given equation, we can first try to factor the cubic polynomial.\n\nNotice that the coefficients of the polynomial follow the pattern of the binomial coefficients of $(a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$. In our case, we have $z^3 - 4z^2 + 6z - 4$. Comparing the coefficients, we can see that $a = z$ and $b = 2$. Thus, the polynomial can be written as:\n\n$(z - 2)^3 = z^3 - 3(z^2)(2) + 3(z)(2^2) - 2^3 = z^3 - 4z^2 + 6z - 4$\n\nNow, we can set the factored polynomial equal to zero:\n\n$(z - 2)^3 = 0$\n\nSince the polynomial is a perfect cube, there is only one real root:\n\n$z - 2 = 0$\n\n$z = 2$\n\nSo, the only value of $z$ that satisfies the given equation is $z = 2$."
