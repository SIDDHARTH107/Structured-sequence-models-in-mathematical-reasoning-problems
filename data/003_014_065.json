    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift of the given equation y = 3sin(2x - pi) + 4, we can identify the different components of the equation:\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = |3| = 3.\n\n2. Period (T): The period is the length of one complete cycle of the sine function. It is calculated as T = (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, B = 2, so T = (2π) / 2 = π.\n\n3. Phase Shift (PS): The phase shift is the horizontal shift of the sine function. It is calculated as PS = C / B, where C is the constant inside the sine function. In this case, C = -π, so PS = (-π) / 2 = -π/2. This means the function is shifted to the right by π/2 units.\n\n4. Vertical Shift (VS): The vertical shift is the constant added to the sine function. In this case, VS = 4, which means the function is shifted up by 4 units.\n\nNow, to graph the corresponding trigonometric function, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw the x and y axes.\n2. Mark the vertical shift by drawing a horizontal line at y = 4.\n3. Mark the amplitude by drawing horizontal lines at y = 4 + 3 = 7 and y = 4 - 3 = 1.\n4. Mark the period by drawing a vertical line at x = π.\n5. Mark the phase shift by drawing a vertical line at x = -π/2.\n6. Sketch the sine function with the given amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift.\n\nThe graph of the function y = 3sin(2x - pi) + 4 will have an amplitude of 3, a period of π, a phase shift of -π/2, and a vertical shift of 4."
