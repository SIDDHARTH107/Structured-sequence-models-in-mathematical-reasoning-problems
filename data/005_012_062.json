If a random sample of 100 households is selected and their mean income is found to be $50,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000, what is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean household income?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean household income, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is $50,000, and the standard deviation is $10,000. The sample size is 100 households. First, we need to calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error (SE) = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\nSE = 10,000 / √100\nSE = 10,000 / 10\nSE = 1,000\n\nNext, we need to find the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. Since we are using a normal distribution, we will use the Z-score. For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96.\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 50,000 ± (1.96 * 1,000)\nConfidence Interval = 50,000 ± 1,960\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean household income is $48,040 to $51,960."
