Use an initial population size of 20 and run the algorithm for 100 iterations. Report the solution you found and the corresponding minimum value of f(x).",
    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is based on the breeding behavior of cuckoos. It is a metaheuristic algorithm, meaning it is a higher-level procedure designed to find the best solution for optimization problems. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute code or run algorithms directly. Instead, I can provide you with a general outline of how to implement the cuckoo search algorithm for this problem.\n\n1. Initialize the population: Generate 20 random solutions (nests) within the given domain (-10 <= x <= 10).\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness: Calculate the value of f(x) for each nest and store the results.\n\n3. Set the number of iterations: In this case, 100 iterations.\n\n4. Begin the iterative process:\n\n   a. Generate a new solution (cuckoo) by modifying an existing nest using a Levy flight distribution.\n   \n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   \n   c. Choose a random nest to compare with the new solution. If the new solution has better fitness, replace the old nest with the new solution.\n   \n   d. Perform a fraction of the worst nests to be abandoned and replaced with new nests generated randomly.\n   \n   e. Update the best solution found so far if a better solution is discovered.\n   \n   f. Repeat steps a-e for the specified number of iterations (100).\n\n5. After completing the iterations, return the best solution found and the corresponding minimum value of f(x).\n\nTo implement the cuckoo search algorithm in a programming language like Python, you can use libraries such as NumPy and SciPy to handle the mathematical operations and random number generation. Once you have implemented the algorithm and run it for the given problem, you can report the solution and the minimum value of f(x) found."
