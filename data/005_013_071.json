    "message_2": "To determine the correlation matrix between the three variables (Math, Science, and English scores), we need the actual data collected from the survey of 100 students. The correlation matrix will show the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables, which range from -1 to 1. A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation, and a value close to 0 indicates no correlation.\n\nOnce you provide the data, I can help you calculate the correlation matrix."
