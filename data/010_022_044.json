    "message_2": "To maximize the number of nonintersecting great circles on a unit sphere such that each point belongs to at least one of the great circles, we can consider the arrangement of these great circles as a polyhedron inscribed in the sphere. In this case, the great circles are the edges of the polyhedron.\n\nThe most symmetrical polyhedron that can be inscribed in a sphere is the regular icosahedron, which has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces. Each edge of the icosahedron corresponds to a great circle on the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of nonintersecting great circles that can be drawn on a unit sphere such that each point belongs to at least one of the great circles is 30."
