    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails, we write the message in a zigzag pattern along the rails and then read the message along each rail from left to right. Here's the pattern:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nThe encrypted message is formed by reading the message along each rail from left to right:\n\nHORELWLDOLO\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"HORELWLDOLO\"."
