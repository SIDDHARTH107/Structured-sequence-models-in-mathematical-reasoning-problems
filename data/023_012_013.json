    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x), we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nSplitting the integral into two parts, one for -π < x < 0 and the other for 0 < x < π:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (1/2) dx + ∫[0, π] (-1/2) dx]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/2 * x)|(-π, 0) + (-1/2 * x)|(0, π)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(0 - (-1/2 * π)) + (-1/2 * π - 0)]\n\na_0 = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nSplitting the integral again:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (1/2) * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] (-1/2) * cos(n * x) dx]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/2 * sin(n * x) / n)|(-π, 0) + (-1/2 * sin(n * x) / n)|(0, π)]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(0 - sin(-n * π) / (2 * n)) + (-sin(n * π) / (2 * n) - 0)]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\na_n = 0\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nSplitting the integral again:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (1/2) * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] (-1/2) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/2 * cos(n * x) / n)|(-π, 0) + (1/2 * cos(n * x) / n)|(0, π)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/2 * cos(n * π) / n + 1/2 * cos(0) / n) + (1/2 * cos(n * π) / n - 1/2 * cos(0) / n)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/2 * (-1)^n / n + 1/2 * 1 / n) + (1/2 * (-1)^n / n - 1/2 * 1 / n)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1 - (-1)^n) / n]\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π)] * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, let's find the value of f(x) at x = π/4:\n\nf(π/4) = Σ [(1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π)] * sin(n * π/4)\n\nSince sin(n * π/4) is nonzero only for odd values of n, we can rewrite the series as:\n\nf(π/4) = Σ [(1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π)] * sin(n * π/4) for odd n\n\nFor odd n, (-1)^n = -1, so the series becomes:\n\nf(π/4) = Σ [2 / (n * π)] * sin(n * π/4) for odd n\n\nThis series converges, but it is difficult to find an exact value for f(π/4). However, we can approximate the value using the first few terms of the series:\n\nf(π/4) ≈ (2 / (1 * π)) * sin(1 * π/4) + (2 / (3 * π)) * sin(3 * π/4) + (2 / (5 * π)) * sin(5 * π/4) + ...\n\nf(π/4) ≈ 0.4251\n\nSo, the approximate value of f(x) at x = π/4 is 0.4251."
