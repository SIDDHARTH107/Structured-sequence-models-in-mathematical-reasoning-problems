    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is typically used for optimization problems. Here's a simplified version of the algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4:\n\n1. Initialize the population of cuckoo eggs (solutions) randomly within the search space (-10 to 10).\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution (the lower the function value, the better the fitness).\n3. Choose a random cuckoo egg and generate a new solution by performing a random walk (Levy flight) in the search space.\n4. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n5. If the new solution has better fitness, replace the original cuckoo egg with the new solution.\n6. Randomly choose a host nest (solution) and replace it with a new cuckoo egg if the new solution has better fitness.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n8. The best solution found during the search process is the minimum value of the function.\n\nApplying the Cuckoo Search Algorithm to the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4, we can find the minimum value. However, as an AI language model, I cannot run the algorithm in real-time. Instead, I can provide you with the minimum value of the function using calculus.\n\nThe minimum value of a quadratic function can be found using the vertex formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nFor the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4, a = 1, b = -3, and c = 4.\n\nx_vertex = -(-3) / (2 * 1) = 3 / 2 = 1.5\n\nNow, plug the x_vertex value back into the function to find the minimum value:\n\nf(1.5) = (1.5)^2 - 3(1.5) + 4 = 2.25 - 4.5 + 4 = 1.75\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4 is 1.75 when x = 1.5."
