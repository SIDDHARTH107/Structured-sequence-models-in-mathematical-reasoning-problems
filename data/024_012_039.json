    "message_2": "To calculate the Hodge star operator on the 3-dimensional manifold given by the equation z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the metric tensor and its determinant.\n\nThe manifold is given by the equation z = x^2 + y^2, which can be written as F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z = 0. We can find the gradient of F, which is the normal vector to the surface:\n\n∇F = (2x, 2y, -1)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), the normal vector is:\n\nN = (2, 2, -1)\n\nNow, we need to find two tangent vectors to the surface at the point (1, 1, 2). We can do this by taking the cross product of N with two linearly independent vectors. Let's choose the standard basis vectors e1 = (1, 0, 0) and e2 = (0, 1, 0):\n\nT1 = N × e1 = (0, -1, -2)\nT2 = N × e2 = (1, 0, -2)\n\nNow we can find the metric tensor g_ij by taking the dot product of the tangent vectors:\n\ng_11 = T1 • T1 = 5\ng_12 = T1 • T2 = 4\ng_21 = T2 • T1 = 4\ng_22 = T2 • T2 = 5\n\nThe metric tensor is:\n\ng = | 5  4 |\n    | 4  5 |\n\nNow we can find the determinant of the metric tensor:\n\ndet(g) = 5 * 5 - 4 * 4 = 9\n\nNow we can calculate the Hodge star operator on this manifold at the point (1, 1, 2). The Hodge star operator acts on differential forms, so let's consider a 1-form ω = a dx + b dy. The Hodge star of ω is given by:\n\n*ω = (1 / sqrt(det(g))) * (a dy - b dx)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), the Hodge star operator is:\n\n*ω = (1 / sqrt(9)) * (a dy - b dx) = (1/3) * (a dy - b dx)"
