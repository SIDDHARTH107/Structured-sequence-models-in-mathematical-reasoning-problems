    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn the given graph G:\n\n```\n   A---B\n   |   |\\\n   |   | \\\n   C---D--E\n```\n\nWe can color the edges as follows:\n\n1. Color the edge AB with color 1.\n2. Color the edge AC with color 2.\n3. Color the edge BC with color 3.\n4. Color the edge BD with color 2.\n5. Color the edge CD with color 1.\n6. Color the edge BE with color 1.\n7. Color the edge DE with color 3.\n\nNo two adjacent edges share the same color, and we used 3 colors. Therefore, the chromatic index of G is 3."
