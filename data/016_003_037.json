    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is the largest connected region in the set, shaped like a heart. The area of the main cardioid can be calculated using the formula for the area of a cardioid:\n\nArea = (1/2)πa²\n\nwhere a is the radius of the cardioid. For the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set, the radius is 1/4. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2)π(1/4)² = (1/2)π(1/16) = π/32 ≈ 0.09817477042\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is approximately 0.09817477042 square units."
