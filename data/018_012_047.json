    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A x B) with A, denoted as (A x B) ∩ A. This is the set of all elements that are both in A x B and in A. Since A contains single elements and A x B contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements between the two sets.\n\n(A x B) ∩ A = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB x A = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (B x A) with A, denoted as (B x A) ∩ A. Similar to the previous case, there are no common elements between B x A and A.\n\n(B x A) ∩ A = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNow, we need to show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection. To do this, we need to show that (A x B) ∩ A ≠ A ∩ (B x A).\n\nWe have already found that (A x B) ∩ A = ∅ and (B x A) ∩ A = ∅. Since both of these sets are equal, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection.\n\nIn conclusion, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection, as (A x B) ∩ A ≠ A ∩ (B x A)."
