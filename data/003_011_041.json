    "message_1": "A building is 150 meters tall. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 35 degrees. What is the distance between the building and the point on the ground?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 35 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (150 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance between the building and the point on the ground, which we'll call \"x\".\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(35°) = 150 / x\n\nTo find the distance \"x\", we can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 150 / tan(35°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of tan(35°) and then divide 150 by that value:\n\ntan(35°) ≈ 0.7002\n\nx ≈ 150 / 0.7002 ≈ 214.14\n\nSo, the distance between the building and the point on the ground is approximately 214.14 meters."
