    "message_1": "A particle is moving along a curve defined by the equation $r(t) = (3\\cos(t),2\\sin(t),t)$. Suppose a vector $\\vec{v}_0 = (1,0,0)$ is initially pointing in the direction of the positive $x$-axis at $t=0$. What is the parallel transport of $\\vec{v}_0$ along the curve $r(t)$ when $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$?",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of $\\vec{v}_0$ along the curve $r(t)$, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve at each point. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to $t$:\n\n$r'(t) = (-3\\sin(t), 2\\cos(t), 1)$.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the transported vector remains parallel to the tangent vector at each point along the curve. This means that the transported vector should be orthogonal to the change in the tangent vector. Let's find the change in the tangent vector by taking its derivative with respect to $t$:\n\n$r''(t) = (-3\\cos(t), -2\\sin(t), 0)$.\n\nLet $\\vec{v}(t)$ be the transported vector at time $t$. We want $\\vec{v}(t)$ to be orthogonal to $r''(t)$, which means their dot product should be zero:\n\n$\\vec{v}(t) \\cdot r''(t) = 0$.\n\nLet $\\vec{v}(t) = (v_x(t), v_y(t), v_z(t))$. Then,\n\n$v_x(t)(-3\\cos(t)) + v_y(t)(-2\\sin(t)) + v_z(t)(0) = 0$.\n\nWe also know that $\\vec{v}(0) = (1, 0, 0)$. To find $\\vec{v}(\\frac{\\pi}{2})$, we can integrate the above equation with respect to $t$:\n\n$v_x(t) = \\int 3\\cos(t) dt = 3\\sin(t) + C_1$,\n\n$v_y(t) = \\int 2\\sin(t) dt = -2\\cos(t) + C_2$,\n\n$v_z(t) = C_3$.\n\nUsing the initial condition $\\vec{v}(0) = (1, 0, 0)$, we get $C_1 = 1$, $C_2 = -2$, and $C_3 = 0$. So,\n\n$\\vec{v}(t) = (3\\sin(t) + 1, -2\\cos(t) - 2, 0)$.\n\nNow, we can find the parallel transport of $\\vec{v}_0$ at $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n\n$\\vec{v}(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (3\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + 1, -2\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) - 2, 0) = (4, -2, 0)$.\n\nSo, the parallel transport of $\\vec{v}_0$ along the curve $r(t)$ when $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is $\\vec{v}(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (4, -2, 0)$."
