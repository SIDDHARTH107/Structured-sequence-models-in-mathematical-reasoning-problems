    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 56 and 72 using the Euclidean algorithm, we'll perform a series of divisions and remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. Then, the GCD will be the last non-zero remainder.\n\nStep 1:\nDivide the larger number (72) by the smaller number (56) and find the remainder:\n72 รท 56 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 16.\n\nStep 2:\nNow, divide the previous divisor (56) by the remainder from Step 1 (16):\n56 รท 16 = 3 (quotient) with a remainder of 8.\n\nStep 3:\nDivide the previous remainder (16) by the new remainder from Step 2 (8):\n16 รท 8 = 2 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we've reached a remainder of 0, the last non-zero remainder (8) is the GCD of 56 and 72.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 56 and 72 is 8."
