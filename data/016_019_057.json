    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve process to each side of an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. After the 6th iteration, the length of each side of the Koch island will be:\n\nInitial length * (4/3)^6\n1 * (4/3)^6 = 4096/729 ≈ 5.619\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, it has three sides. Therefore, the total length of the Koch island after the 6th iteration is:\n\n3 * 5.619 ≈ 16.857"
