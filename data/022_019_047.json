    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral using the Cauchy Integral Formula, we first need to identify the function $f(z)$ and the point $z_0$. In this case, we have:\n\n$f(z) = 2z^3 - 5z + 1$\n\n$z_0 = 1$\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of $f(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(2z^3 - 5z + 1) = 6z^2 - 5$\n\nAccording to the Cauchy Integral Formula, if $f(z)$ is analytic in a region containing a simple, positively oriented closed contour $C$ and if $z_0$ is any point interior to that contour, then:\n\n$\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^2} \\,dz = 2\\pi i f'(z_0)$\n\nIn our case, the contour $C$ is the circle $|z|=1$, and $z_0 = 1$ is interior to that contour. Therefore, we can apply the Cauchy Integral Formula:\n\n$\\int_{|z|=1} \\frac{2z^3-5z+1}{(z-1)^2} \\,dz = 2\\pi i f'(1)$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $f'(1)$:\n\n$f'(1) = 6(1)^2 - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1$\n\nFinally, we can substitute this value back into the formula:\n\n$\\int_{|z|=1} \\frac{2z^3-5z+1}{(z-1)^2} \\,dz = 2\\pi i f'(1) = 2\\pi i (1) = 2\\pi i$\n\nSo, the value of the integral is $2\\pi i$."
