    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is given by the equation:\n\nr(θ) = 1 - cos(θ)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the origin to a point on the boundary of the cardioid, and θ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to that point.\n\nTo find the area of the main cardioid, we can use the polar coordinate system and integrate over the range of θ from 0 to 2π:\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫[r(θ)]^2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nSubstitute the equation for r(θ):\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, expand the square:\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + cos^2(θ)) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nTo integrate the cos^2(θ) term, we can use the double-angle identity:\n\ncos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + (1 + cos(2θ))/2) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(2 - 2cos(θ) + 1 + cos(2θ))/2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, integrate each term separately:\n\nArea = 1/2 * [∫(3/2) dθ - 2∫cos(θ) dθ + 1/2∫cos(2θ) dθ] from 0 to 2π\n\nThe antiderivatives are:\n\n(3/2)θ - 2sin(θ) + 1/4sin(2θ)\n\nNow, evaluate the antiderivatives at the limits of integration:\n\n[(3/2)(2π) - 2sin(2π) + 1/4sin(4π)] - [(3/2)(0) - 2sin(0) + 1/4sin(0)]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(3π - 0 + 0) - (0 - 0 + 0) = 3π\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is 3π square units."
