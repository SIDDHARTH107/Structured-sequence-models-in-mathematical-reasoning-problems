    "message_2": "The sparse matrix method is not applicable to this system of linear equations, as it is used for matrices with a large number of zero elements. However, we can solve this system using other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule.\n\nLet's use Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix:\n\n    | 1  2  3 | 10 |\n    | 4  5  6 | 20 |\n    | 7  8  9 | 30 |\n\n2. Perform row operations to get an upper triangular matrix:\n\n   Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and 7 times the first row from the third row:\n\n    | 1  2  3 | 10 |\n    | 0 -3 -6 |-20 |\n    | 0 -6 -12|-40 |\n\n   Subtract 2 times the second row from the third row:\n\n    | 1  2  3 | 10 |\n    | 0 -3 -6 |-20 |\n    | 0  0  0 |  0 |\n\n3. The last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true. This means that the system has infinitely many solutions, and it is dependent.\n\nTo express the general solution, we can write the first two equations as:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 10\n-3y - 6z = -20\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y in terms of z:\n\ny = (20 + 6z) / 3\nx = 10 - 2y - 3z\n\nSubstituting y:\n\nx = 10 - 2((20 + 6z) / 3) - 3z\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx = 10 - (40 + 12z) / 3 - 3z\nx = (30 - 12z) / 3 - 3z\nx = 10 - 4z - 3z\nx = 10 - 7z\n\nThe general solution can be written as:\n\nx = 10 - 7z\ny = (20 + 6z) / 3\nz = z\n\nwhere z is a free variable."
