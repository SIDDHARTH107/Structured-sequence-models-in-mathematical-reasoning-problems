    "message_1": "A company wants to test the effectiveness of four different advertising methods (A, B, C, and D) for a new product. They decide to test these methods using an orthogonal array of strength 3, with six experimental runs. Each run involves using a different combination of advertising methods. How many unique combinations of advertising methods are tested in this experiment?",
    "message_2": "An orthogonal array of strength 3 means that every combination of three advertising methods appears an equal number of times in the experimental runs. Since there are six experimental runs, we can use the formula for combinations to determine the number of unique combinations of advertising methods:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of advertising methods (4 in this case) and k is the number of methods in each combination (3 in this case).\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!)\nC(4, 3) = 24 / (6 * 1)\nC(4, 3) = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 unique combinations of advertising methods tested in this experiment."
