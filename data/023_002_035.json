    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the function. Since f(x) is an odd function, we only need to find the sine series representation.\n\nThe Fourier sine series representation of f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2/π) * ∫(x * sin(nx) dx) * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the interval [-π, π].\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier coefficients:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫(x * sin(nx) dx) from -π to π\n\nIntegrating by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * ∫ cos(nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * (1/n) * sin(nx)] from -π to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(2 * π^2 * cos(nπ) - 2 * π * sin(nπ))/n^3]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ) = 0:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(2 * π^2 * (-1)^n)/n^3]\n\nSo, the Fourier sine series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2/π) * (2 * π^2 * (-1)^n)/n^3] * sin(nx)\n\nNow, let's analyze the convergence of this series.\n\n1. Pointwise convergence:\n\nBy Dirichlet's theorem, the Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) at every point x in the interval [-π, π] if f(x) is piecewise continuous and has piecewise continuous derivatives on the interval. Since f(x) = x is continuous and has continuous derivatives on the interval, the Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) on the interval [-π, π].\n\n2. Uniform convergence:\n\nThe Fourier series converges uniformly to f(x) on the interval [-π, π] if the series of the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients converges. In this case, the absolute value of the Fourier coefficients is:\n\n|b_n| = (4 * π^2)/n^3\n\nThe series ∑(4 * π^2)/n^3 converges by the p-series test (with p = 3 > 1). Therefore, the Fourier series converges uniformly to f(x) on the interval [-π, π].\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] converges both pointwise and uniformly."
