    "message_1": "A cable company needs to lay a new fiber optic line to connect a remote community to the network. The community is located on the other side of a hilly area, and the cable company has to decide on the best route to lay the cable. There are three possible routes, each with a different length and cost.\n\nRoute A: 10 miles long, with a cost of $100,000.\nRoute B: 12 miles long, with a cost of $120,000.\nRoute C: 8 miles long, with a cost of $150,000.\n\nThe cable company wants to select the route that minimizes the cost per mile. Use non-convex optimization to determine which route the cable company should select.",
    "message_2": "To determine the route that minimizes the cost per mile, we need to calculate the cost per mile for each route and compare them.\n\nCost per mile = Total cost / Total miles\n\nRoute A:\nCost per mile = $100,000 / 10 miles = $10,000 per mile\n\nRoute B:\nCost per mile = $120,000 / 12 miles = $10,000 per mile\n\nRoute C:\nCost per mile = $150,000 / 8 miles = $18,750 per mile\n\nComparing the cost per mile for each route, we can see that Route A and Route B both have the lowest cost per mile at $10,000. Since non-convex optimization is not necessary in this case, as there are only three options to compare, the cable company should choose either Route A or Route B, as they both have the same cost per mile. The choice between Route A and Route B may depend on other factors such as terrain, accessibility, and potential future expansion."
