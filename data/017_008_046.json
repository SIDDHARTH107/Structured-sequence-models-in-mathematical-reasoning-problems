    "message_2": "An isomorphism is a bijective function between two groups that preserves the group operation. In this case, we are looking for isomorphisms between a group G of order 8 and the cyclic group C8. Since both groups have the same order, we can start by finding all groups of order 8 and then determine if they are isomorphic to C8.\n\nThere are five groups of order 8 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8.\n2. C4 × C2: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 4 and the cyclic group of order 2.\n3. D8: The dihedral group of order 8 (symmetries of a square).\n4. Q8: The quaternion group of order 8.\n5. Z2 × Z2 × Z2: The direct product of three copies of the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nNow, let's check which of these groups are isomorphic to C8:\n\n1. C8 is obviously isomorphic to itself.\n2. C4 × C2 is not isomorphic to C8 because C8 has an element of order 8, while the maximum order of an element in C4 × C2 is 4.\n3. D8 is not isomorphic to C8 because D8 is not abelian, while C8 is abelian.\n4. Q8 is not isomorphic to C8 because Q8 has elements of order 4, while all non-identity elements in C8 have order 8.\n5. Z2 × Z2 × Z2 is not isomorphic to C8 because it has no element of order 8, while C8 has one.\n\nThus, the only possible isomorphism for a group of order 8 with respect to the cyclic group C8 is the isomorphism between C8 and itself."
