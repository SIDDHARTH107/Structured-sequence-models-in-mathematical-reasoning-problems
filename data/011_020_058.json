    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to form a committee of 3 people from a group of 6 people, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (6 in this case) and k is the number of people in the committee (3 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(6, 3) = (720) / (6 × 6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo there are 20 different ways to form a committee of 3 people from a group of 6 people."
