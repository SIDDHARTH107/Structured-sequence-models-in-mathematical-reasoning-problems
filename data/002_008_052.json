    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π is approximately 3.14.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14 * (5²) * 12\n\nFirst, we square the radius:\n\n5² = 25\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14 * 25 * 12\n\nNext, we multiply the numbers:\n\nVolume = 3.14 * 25 * 12 / 3\n\nVolume = 3.14 * 100\n\nFinally, we multiply the remaining values:\n\nVolume ≈ 314 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 314 cubic centimeters."
