    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a topological space is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a torus, we can consider it as a quotient space of a rectangle, where the opposite sides are identified. To compute the Euler characteristic, we can use a polygonal representation of the torus, such as a square with identified edges. In this representation, we have:\n\n- 1 vertex (all 4 corners of the rectangle are identified as a single vertex)\n- 2 edges (the top and bottom edges are identified as one edge, and the left and right edges are identified as another edge)\n- 1 face (the rectangle itself)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of a torus is 0."
