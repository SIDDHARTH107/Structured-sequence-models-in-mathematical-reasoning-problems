    "message_2": "To show that there exist only one cyclic group and one non-abelian group of order 30 up to isomorphism, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 30. Since 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, divides 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. The number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, divides 10 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, divides 6 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2, a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3, and a unique 5-Sylow subgroup P_5. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Since their orders are pairwise coprime, their intersection is trivial, and their product has order 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 30. This is the cyclic group C30.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be a 3-Sylow subgroup and P_5 be a 5-Sylow subgroup. Since P_2 is normal, the product P_2P_3 is a subgroup of G with order 6. This subgroup is either isomorphic to C6 or S3. If it is isomorphic to C6, then G would be a semi-direct product of P_2P_3 and P_5, which would be abelian, contradicting the fact that G is non-abelian. Therefore, P_2P_3 must be isomorphic to S3.\n\nNow, consider the semi-direct product of P_5 and P_2P_3, denoted as P_5 ⋊ P_2P_3. This group has order 30 and is non-abelian since P_2P_3 is non-abelian. Moreover, it is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15. To see this, note that P_5 is isomorphic to C5, which has a presentation ⟨a | a^5 = 1⟩, and P_2P_3 is isomorphic to S3, which has a presentation ⟨b, c | b^2 = c^3 = (bc)^2 = 1⟩. The semi-direct product P_5 ⋊ P_2P_3 has a presentation ⟨a, b, c | a^5 = b^2 = c^3 = (bc)^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1), c^(-1)ac = a^2⟩, which is exactly the presentation of the dihedral group D15.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and the resulting group is also isomorphic to D15.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, there are no normal Sylow subgroups other than the center of G. However, since G is non-abelian, its center must be trivial. This contradicts the fact that the intersection of the Sylow subgroups is non-trivial. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, there exist only one cyclic group of order 30, which is C30, and one non-abelian group of order 30, which is D15. The third group of order 30 is isomorphic to either C30 or D15, depending on the number of Sylow subgroups."
