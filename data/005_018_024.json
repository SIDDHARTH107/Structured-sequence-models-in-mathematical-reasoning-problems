    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. The memoryless property states that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of the time that has already passed.\n\nLet X be the lifetime of the car battery, which follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 4 years. The probability density function (pdf) of an exponential distribution is given by:\n\nf(x) = (1/μ) * e^(-x/μ)\n\nwhere μ is the mean lifetime (4 years in this case).\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) is given by:\n\nF(x) = 1 - e^(-x/μ)\n\nWe want to find the probability that the battery lasts at least 3 years given that it has already lasted 2 years, which can be written as:\n\nP(X ≥ 3 | X ≥ 2)\n\nUsing the memoryless property, we can rewrite this as:\n\nP(X ≥ 1)\n\nNow, we can use the CDF to find the probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - F(1) = 1 - (1 - e^(-1/4))\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = e^(-1/4) ≈ 0.7788\n\nSo, the probability of the car battery lasting at least 3 years given that it has already lasted 2 years is approximately 0.7788 or 77.88%."
