    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the second cohomology group $H^2(X,\\mathbb{Q})$, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that if $X$ is a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ and $H$ is a hyperplane section of $X$, then the restriction map $H^k(X,\\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^k(H,\\mathbb{Q})$ is an isomorphism for $k < n-1$ and injective for $k = n-1$.\n\nIn our case, $X$ is a projective variety defined by the given equations in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. Since $X$ is a projective variety in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, its dimension is $n = 2$. Therefore, we can apply the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to compute the dimension of $H^2(X,\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nLet $H$ be a hyperplane section of $X$. Then, the restriction map $H^2(X,\\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^2(H,\\mathbb{Q})$ is injective. Since $H$ is a hyperplane section of $X$, it is a curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. The second cohomology group of a curve is trivial, i.e., $H^2(H,\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$. Therefore, the restriction map $H^2(X,\\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^2(H,\\mathbb{Q})$ is injective, but its target is trivial.\n\nHence, the dimension of the second cohomology group $H^2(X,\\mathbb{Q})$ is 0."
