    "message_2": "A Sierpinski Pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski Tetrahedron, is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of tetrahedrons at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of Tetrahedrons = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the level of the Sierpinski Pyramid.\n\nFor the 4th level, we have:\n\nNumber of Tetrahedrons = 4^4 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 tetrahedrons in the 4th level of a Sierpinski Pyramid."
