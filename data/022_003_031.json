    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral, we first need to check if the integrand has any singularities inside the contour C. The integrand is given by $f(z) = z^2 + 3z + 2\\cos(z)$. This function is analytic everywhere in the complex plane since it is a sum of analytic functions (polynomials and cosine function).\n\nNow, we can use Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of an analytic function over a simple closed curve is zero. Therefore, the value of the complex integral is:\n\n$\\oint_C (z^2 + 3z + 2\\cos(z)) dz = 0$"
