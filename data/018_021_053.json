The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\nA ∩ B = {5, 7}\n\nA △ B = {3, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of (A △ B) with the set {5, 7}.\n\n(A △ B) ∩ {5, 7} = {3, 9, 10} ∩ {5, 7} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nNow, let's verify the distributive property of the symmetric difference over intersection:\n\nA △ (B ∩ {5, 7}) = A △ ({5, 7})\n\n(A △ {5, 7}) = ({3, 5, 7, 9} △ {5, 7}) = {3, 9}\n\n(B △ {5, 7}) = ({5, 7, 10} △ {5, 7}) = {10}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of the two sets:\n\n(A △ {5, 7}) ∩ (B △ {5, 7}) = {3, 9} ∩ {10} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nThus, the distributive property of the symmetric difference over intersection holds true:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ {5, 7} = A △ (B ∩ {5, 7})"
