    "message_1": "Consider the 1D reaction-diffusion equation given by \n\nu_t = D u_xx + f(u), \n\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient and f(u) is a nonlinear reaction term. Let the domain be a rod of length L=10 cm, and suppose the rod is initially at uniform temperature u(x,0) = u0 = 25C for x in the range 0 <= x <= L. Suppose the boundary conditions are u(0,t) = 100C and u(L,t) = 0C for all time t>=0.\n\nSuppose that D= 0.1 cm^2/s and the reaction term is given by f(u) = -0.02u(u-25)(u-50). Find the solution u(x,t) for t = 100 s and plot it over the range 0 <= x <= L.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given reaction-diffusion equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the finite difference method. We will discretize the spatial domain into N intervals and the time domain into M intervals. Let Δx = L/N and Δt = T/M, where T is the final time (100 s in this case). We can approximate the second derivative u_xx using the central difference scheme and the first derivative u_t using the forward difference scheme.\n\nLet u_i^n denote the approximate solution at the spatial point x_i = iΔx and time t_n = nΔt. Then, the discretized equation is:\n\n(u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n) / Δt = D (u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n) / Δx^2 + f(u_i^n)\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for u_i^{n+1}:\n\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + Δt [D (u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n) / Δx^2 + f(u_i^n)]\n\nNow, we can implement this equation in a numerical algorithm to find the solution at t = 100 s. Here's a Python code that does this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef f(u):\n    return -0.02 * u * (u - 25) * (u - 50)\n\nL = 10\nN = 100\ndx = L / N\nx = np.linspace(0, L, N+1)\n\nT = 100\nM = 1000\ndt = T / M\n\nD = 0.1\n\nu = np.full(N+1, 25)\nu[0] = 100\nu[-1] = 0\n\nfor n in range(M):\n    u_new = np.copy(u)\n    for i in range(1, N):\n        u_new[i] = u[i] + dt * (D * (u[i+1] - 2*u[i] + u[i-1]) / dx**2 + f(u[i]))\n    u = u_new\n\nplt.plot(x, u)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('u(x, 100)')\nplt.title('Solution at t = 100 s')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will plot the solution u(x, 100) over the range 0 <= x <= L. Note that this is an approximate solution, and the accuracy can be improved by using smaller values for Δx and Δt."
