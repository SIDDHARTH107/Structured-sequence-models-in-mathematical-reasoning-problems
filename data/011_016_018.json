    "message_2": "To find the total number of matches in the tournament, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of teams and k is the number of teams playing in each match (which is 2 in this case).\n\nSo, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\n= 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\n= (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2 * 8!)\n\n= (10 * 9)/2\n\n= 45\n\nTherefore, the tournament needs to schedule 45 matches."
