Consider the group given by the following presentation:\n\nG = ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^2 = 1, b*a*b = a^(-1)⟩\n\nFirst, let's show that G has order 16. There are 8 possible powers of a (a^0, a^1, ..., a^7) and 2 possible powers of b (b^0, b^1). Since a and b have orders 8 and 2, respectively, and since they satisfy the given relations, there are 8 * 2 = 16 distinct elements in G.\n\nNow, let's show that G is not isomorphic to C16 or D8.\n\n1. G is not isomorphic to C16:\n\nC16 is a cyclic group of order 16, so it has an element of order 16. In G, the element a has order 8, and the element b has order 2. Since the order of an element divides the order of the group, the order of any element in G must divide 16. However, there is no element in G of order 16, so G cannot be isomorphic to C16.\n\n2. G is not isomorphic to D8:\n\nD8 is the dihedral group of order 16, which can be represented as the group of symmetries of a regular octagon. D8 has 8 rotational symmetries and 8 reflectional symmetries. In D8, there is an element of order 8 (a rotation) and an element of order 2 (a reflection). However, the relation between the elements of order 8 and 2 in D8 is different from the relation in G.\n\nIn D8, the relation between the rotation (r) and reflection (s) is given by s*r*s = r^(-1), while in G, the relation is given by b*a*b = a^(-1). Although these relations look similar, they are not equivalent. In D8, the reflection s commutes with r^2, i.e., s*r^2*s = r^2. However, in G, we have:\n\nb*a^2*b = b*(a*b*a)*b = (b*a*b)*(b*a*b) = a^(-1)*a^(-1) = a^(-2)\n\nThis shows that the element b does not commute with a^2, which is a property not shared by D8. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to D8.\n\nIn conclusion, we have constructed a group G of order 16 that is not isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16 or the dihedral group D8."
