    "message_2": "To perform Fourier analysis on the monthly returns of ABC Ltd.'s stock, we will use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) since we have a finite set of data points. The DFT is defined as:\n\nX(k) = Σ(x(n) * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * n / N))\n\nwhere X(k) is the k-th frequency component, x(n) is the n-th data point, N is the total number of data points (12 in this case), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFirst, let's represent the monthly returns as a vector:\n\nx = [5, -2, 6, 1, 3, -4, 2, -1, 8, 4, -3, 7]\n\nNow, we will calculate the DFT for each frequency component k from 0 to N/2 (since the second half of the components are complex conjugates of the first half for real-valued data):\n\nX(0) = Σ(x(n)) = 26 (DC component or average value)\n\nX(1) = Σ(x(n) * e^(-j * 2 * π * 1 * n / 12))\n\nX(2) = Σ(x(n) * e^(-j * 2 * π * 2 * n / 12))\n\n...\n\nX(6) = Σ(x(n) * e^(-j * 2 * π * 6 * n / 12))\n\nCalculating these values, we get:\n\nX(0) = 26\nX(1) ≈ -4.9 + 9.1j\nX(2) ≈ 1.7 - 1.7j\nX(3) ≈ 2.9 + 0.5j\nX(4) ≈ -1.7 - 1.7j\nX(5) ≈ 0.9 - 9.1j\nX(6) = 2\n\nThese are the frequency components of the monthly returns of ABC Ltd.'s stock over the past year. Note that the magnitude of the components represents the strength of the corresponding frequency, and the angle represents the phase shift."
