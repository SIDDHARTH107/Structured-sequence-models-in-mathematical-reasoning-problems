    "message_2": "To find the measure of the angle between the hypotenuse and the base, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg (the height) and then use the inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b): c^2 = a^2 + b^2.\n\nIn this case, we have the base (a) and the hypotenuse (c), so we can solve for the height (b):\n\n13^2 = 5^2 + b^2\n169 = 25 + b^2\n144 = b^2\nb = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the height, we can use the inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle between the hypotenuse and the base. We can use the tangent function, which is the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (base):\n\ntan(θ) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(θ) = 12 / 5\n\nNow, we can use the inverse tangent function (arctan) to find the angle:\n\nθ = arctan(12 / 5)\nθ ≈ 67.38°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle between the hypotenuse and the base is approximately 67.38°."
