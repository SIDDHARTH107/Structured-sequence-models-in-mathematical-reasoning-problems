    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific problem related to the Fourier transform and image processing:\n\n\"A digital image is represented as a 512 x 512 matrix of pixels which has undergone zero-padding to increase its resolution. Apply the discrete Fourier transform to the image and find the amplitude of the frequency component at row 100 and column 200.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to apply the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the given 512 x 512 matrix and then find the amplitude of the frequency component at row 100 and column 200.\n\n1. Apply the DFT to the matrix:\n\nThe DFT of a 2D matrix (image) can be computed using the following formula:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ[Σ[f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2π * (ux/M + vy/N))]], where u = 0, 1, ..., M-1 and v = 0, 1, ..., N-1\n\nHere, f(x, y) is the pixel value at position (x, y) in the image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (in this case, both are 512), and F(u, v) is the Fourier transform of the image at frequency (u, v).\n\n2. Find the amplitude of the frequency component at row 100 and column 200:\n\nOnce we have computed the DFT, we can find the amplitude of the frequency component at row 100 and column 200 by calculating the magnitude of the complex number F(100, 200):\n\nAmplitude = |F(100, 200)|\n\nSince we don't have the actual pixel values of the image, we cannot compute the exact amplitude value. However, this is the general approach to solving this problem. In practice, you would use a programming language or software (such as Python with the NumPy library or MATLAB) to compute the DFT and find the amplitude of the desired frequency component."
