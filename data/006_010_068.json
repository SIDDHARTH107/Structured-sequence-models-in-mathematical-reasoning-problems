    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence rate of the disease), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (not having the disease).\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 2 people being affected, so we need to find the probability of 0 or 1 person being affected and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's first find the probability of 0 people being affected:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(10, 0) * (0.1)^0 * (0.9)^10\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.9^10\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.3487\n\nNow let's find the probability of 1 person being affected:\n\nP(X = 1) = C(10, 1) * (0.1)^1 * (0.9)^9\nP(X = 1) = 10 * 0.1 * 0.9^9\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.3874\n\nNow we can find the probability of at least 2 people being affected:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.3487 - 0.3874\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 0.2639\n\nSo the probability of at least 2 people in a group of 10 being affected by the disease is approximately 26.39%."
