    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the matrix A. The characteristic equation is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = {{3 - λ, 2}, {4, 5 - λ}}\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\n|A - λI| = (3 - λ)(5 - λ) - (2)(4)\n|A - λI| = λ^2 - 8λ + 7\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the characteristic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 8λ + 7 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored as:\n\n(λ - 1)(λ - 7) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 7.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n({{3 - 1, 2}, {4, 5 - 1}})v1 = 0\n({{2, 2}, {4, 4}})v1 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this as a system of linear equations:\n\n2x1 + 2x2 = 0\n4x1 + 4x2 = 0\n\nThis system has infinitely many solutions, but we can find a basis for the eigenspace by solving for x2 in terms of x1:\n\nx2 = -x1\n\nLet x1 = 1, then x2 = -1. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 1 is v1 = [1, -1].\n\nFor λ2 = 7:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n({{3 - 7, 2}, {4, 5 - 7}})v2 = 0\n({{-4, 2}, {4, -2}})v2 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this as a system of linear equations:\n\n-4x1 + 2x2 = 0\n4x1 - 2x2 = 0\n\nThis system also has infinitely many solutions, but we can find a basis for the eigenspace by solving for x2 in terms of x1:\n\nx2 = 2x1\n\nLet x1 = 1, then x2 = 2. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 7 is v2 = [1, 2].\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 7, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [1, -1] and v2 = [1, 2]."
