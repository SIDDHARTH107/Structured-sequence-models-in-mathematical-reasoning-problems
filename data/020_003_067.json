    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. The profit per unit for product X is $8, and the profit per unit for product Y is $12. Each unit of product X requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while each unit of product Y requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The company has 500 labor hours and 800 machine hours available. What is the maximum total profit that the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. We want to maximize the total profit, which is given by the equation:\n\nTotal Profit = 8x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 500 (labor hours constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 800 (machine hours constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 500\ny ≤ -2x + 500\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 800\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + (800/3)\n\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = -2x + 500 and y = (-1/3)x + (800/3):\n-2x + 500 = (-1/3)x + (800/3)\n(5/3)x = 200\nx = 120\ny = -2(120) + 500 = 260\n\n2. Intersection of y = -2x + 500 and x = 0:\nx = 0\ny = -2(0) + 500 = 500\n\n3. Intersection of y = (-1/3)x + (800/3) and x = 0:\nx = 0\ny = (-1/3)(0) + (800/3) = 800/3 ≈ 266.67\n\n4. Intersection of y = (-1/3)x + (800/3) and y = 0:\ny = 0\nx = 800\n\nHowever, x = 800 does not satisfy the labor hours constraint (2x + y ≤ 500), so it is not a feasible solution.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the total profit at each of the feasible vertices:\n\n1. (x, y) = (120, 260)\nTotal Profit = 8(120) + 12(260) = 960 + 3120 = $4,080\n\n2. (x, y) = (0, 500)\nTotal Profit = 8(0) + 12(500) = 0 + 6000 = $6,000\n\n3. (x, y) = (0, 800/3)\nTotal Profit = 8(0) + 12(800/3) = 0 + 3200 = $3,200\n\nThe maximum total profit is $6,000, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product X and 500 units of product Y."
