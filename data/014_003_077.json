    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob using the ElGamal encryption method. Alice's public key is (p=17, g=3, y=6) and her private key is x=5. To encrypt the message M=11, Bob picks k=2 and calculates (a=10, b=14). Determine the decrypted message using the ElGamal decryption method.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the ElGamal decryption method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate s = a^x mod p, where a is the first part of the ciphertext, x is Alice's private key, and p is the prime number in the public key.\n2. Calculate M = (b * s^(-1)) mod p, where b is the second part of the ciphertext, s^(-1) is the modular inverse of s, and p is the prime number in the public key.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Calculate s:\ns = a^x mod p\ns = 10^5 mod 17\ns = 100000 mod 17\ns = 4\n\n2. Calculate the modular inverse of s:\nWe need to find a number s_inv such that (s * s_inv) mod p = 1.\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular inverse of s (4) with respect to p (17):\ns_inv = 4^(-1) mod 17\ns_inv = 13 (since 4 * 13 = 52, and 52 mod 17 = 1)\n\n3. Calculate the decrypted message M:\nM = (b * s^(-1)) mod p\nM = (14 * 13) mod 17\nM = 182 mod 17\nM = 11\n\nSo, the decrypted message is M = 11."
