    "message_2": "First, let's clarify that the symbol \"△\" represents the symmetric difference between two sets. The symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted A △ B, is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nNow, let's calculate (A △ B) △ A:\n\nA = {1, 3, 5}\nB = {2, 4}\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (since 1, 3, and 5 are in A but not in B, and 2 and 4 are in B but not in A)\n\nNow, we calculate (A △ B) △ A:\n\n(A △ B) △ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} △ {1, 3, 5}\n\nThis results in the set {2, 4}, as 1, 3, and 5 are in both sets and are therefore not included in the symmetric difference.\n\nNow let's calculate A △ (B △ A):\n\nB △ A = {2, 4} (as calculated before)\n\nA △ (B △ A) = {1, 3, 5} △ {2, 4}\n\nThis results in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, as all elements are in either A or B △ A, but not in both.\n\nComparing the two results:\n\n(A △ B) △ A = {2, 4}\nA △ (B △ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSince these two sets are not equal, we have proven that (A △ B) △ A is not equal to A △ (B △ A)."
