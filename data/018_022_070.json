    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection: A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA = {1, 3, 5}\nB = {2, 4}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {} (since A and B have no common elements)\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A Δ B with itself:\n\n(A Δ B) × (A Δ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} × {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nThe Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ B. In this case:\n\n(A Δ B) × (A Δ B) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)}\n\nNow, let's address the commutativity of the symmetric difference operation. The symmetric difference operation is actually commutative, meaning that A Δ B = B Δ A. This is because the union and intersection operations are both commutative, and the symmetric difference is defined in terms of these operations:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = B Δ A\n\nIn our example:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB Δ A = {2, 4, 1, 3, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nAs we can see, A Δ B = B Δ A, which shows that the symmetric difference operation is commutative."
