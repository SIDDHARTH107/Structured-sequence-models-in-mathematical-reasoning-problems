    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a political party winning a majority of seats in a parliamentary election with 500 seats, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume there are only two political parties, Party A and Party B, and each candidate has an equal chance of winning a seat (50% chance for Party A and 50% chance for Party B).\n\nA majority of seats means that a party needs to win at least 251 seats out of 500. We can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of Party A winning a majority of seats:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of Party A winning x seats, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, n is the total number of seats (500), x is the number of seats Party A needs to win (251 to 500), and p is the probability of Party A winning a seat (0.5).\n\nTo find the probability of Party A winning a majority of seats, we need to sum the probabilities for all values of x from 251 to 500:\n\nP(majority) = Σ P(x) for x = 251 to 500\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, but we can use the complement rule to simplify the calculation. The complement rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring:\n\nP(majority) = 1 - P(not majority)\n\nIn this case, the \"not majority\" event is Party A winning 250 or fewer seats. So, we can calculate the sum for x = 0 to 250 and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(majority) = 1 - Σ P(x) for x = 0 to 250\n\nUsing a computer or statistical software to calculate the sum, we get:\n\nP(majority) ≈ 0.5054\n\nSo, the probability of a political party winning a majority of seats in a parliamentary election with 500 seats, given that each candidate has an identical chance of winning, is approximately 50.54%."
