Choose a random starting point x = 2.\n3. Iterate the function f(x) and f(f(x)) to find a non-trivial factor of 210.\n\nLet's start the iteration:\n\n1st iteration:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 210 = 5\ny = f(f(x)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 210 = 26\n\ngcd(210, |5 - 26|) = gcd(210, 21) = 21\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor 21. Now we can divide 210 by 21 to find the other factor:\n\n210 / 21 = 10\n\nSo, the factors of 210 using Pollard's rho algorithm are 21 and 10. However, since these factors are not prime, we can further factor them:\n\n21 = 3 * 7\n10 = 2 * 5\n\nThus, the prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7."
