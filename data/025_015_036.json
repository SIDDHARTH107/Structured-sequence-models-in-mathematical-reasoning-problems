    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane containing the intersection of the given surfaces, we can use the method of substitution. We will first solve the second equation for one of the variables, say $z$, and then substitute that expression into the first equation.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n$z = x - y$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $z$ into the first equation:\n$x^2 + y^2 + (x - y)^2 = 25$\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n$x^2 + y^2 + x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 25$\n$2x^2 + 2y^2 - 2xy = 25$\n\nNow, we can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify it further:\n$x^2 + y^2 - xy = \\dfrac{25}{2}$\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation in the form of a plane equation, which is $Ax + By + Cz = D$. To do this, we can introduce a new variable, say $w$, and set it equal to the expression we found for $z$:\n$w = x - y$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the simplified equation as:\n$x^2 + y^2 - xy - \\dfrac{25}{2} = 0$\n\nAnd substitute $w$ back into the equation:\n$x^2 + y^2 - w^2 - \\dfrac{25}{2} = 0$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in the form of a plane equation:\n$x^2 + y^2 - w^2 = \\dfrac{25}{2}$\n\nSo, the equation of the plane containing the intersection of the given surfaces is:\n$x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = \\dfrac{25}{2}$"
