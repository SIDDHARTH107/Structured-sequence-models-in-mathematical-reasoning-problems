    "message_1": "Suppose a company has 100 employees and the probability that any given employee commits financial fraud is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 5 employees in the company commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 employees commit financial fraud, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of the opposite event occurring. In this case, the opposite event is that 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 employees commit financial fraud. We can calculate this probability and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 employees committing financial fraud.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of exactly k employees committing financial fraud:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (100), k is the number of employees committing financial fraud, p is the probability of an employee committing financial fraud (0.05), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 employees committing financial fraud:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0) ≈ 0.00592\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1) ≈ 0.03116\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2) ≈ 0.08118\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3) ≈ 0.13956\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * 0.05^4 * (1-0.05)^(100-4) ≈ 0.17837\n\nNow, we'll sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 4) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) ≈ 0.43619\n\nFinally, we'll find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X ≤ 4) ≈ 1 - 0.43619 ≈ 0.56381\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 employees in the company commit financial fraud is approximately 0.56381 or 56.381%."
