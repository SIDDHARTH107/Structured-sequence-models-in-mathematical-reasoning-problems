    "message_1": "A company wants to connect its headquarters to several branches using a network of cables. The cost of installing a cable from the headquarters to each branch is different. The cost of installing a cable from the headquarters to branch A is $1000, to branch B is $1200, to branch C is $800, and to branch D is $1500. In order to minimize the total cost, the company has to decide which branches to connect directly to the headquarters and which ones to connect indirectly via other branches. Assuming that the cost of using an existing cable is negligible, what is the minimum cost that the company should expect to incur in connecting all the branches to the headquarters?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total cost, the company should connect the headquarters directly to the branch with the lowest installation cost and then connect the other branches indirectly through that branch. In this case, the branch with the lowest installation cost is branch C, with a cost of $800.\n\nNow, we need to connect branches A, B, and D indirectly through branch C. Since the cost of using an existing cable is negligible, we only need to consider the cost of installing cables between branch C and the other branches. The costs are as follows:\n\n- C to A: $1000\n- C to B: $1200\n- C to D: $1500\n\nTo minimize the cost, we should connect branch C to the two branches with the lowest installation costs, which are branches A and B. The total cost for these connections is $1000 + $1200 = $2200.\n\nFinally, we need to connect branch D. Since branch D has the highest installation cost, we should connect it indirectly through one of the other branches. In this case, we can connect it to either branch A or B, as the cost of using an existing cable is negligible.\n\nSo, the minimum cost the company should expect to incur in connecting all the branches to the headquarters is the cost of connecting the headquarters to branch C ($800) plus the cost of connecting branches A and B to branch C ($2200), which is $800 + $2200 = $3000."
