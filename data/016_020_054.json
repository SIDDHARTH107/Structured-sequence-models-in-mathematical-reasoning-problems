    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski tetrahedron construction, each tetrahedron is replaced by 4 smaller tetrahedra in each stage. Therefore, the number of tetrahedra in each stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of tetrahedra in stage n = 4^n\n\nIn the seventh stage (n=7), the number of tetrahedra would be:\n\nNumber of tetrahedra in stage 7 = 4^7 = 16,384"
