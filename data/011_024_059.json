The network of pipes connecting the factory to the sources of raw material and the storage units has a maximum flow rate of 200 units per hour. The following table shows the flow capacity and associated costs for each pipe in the network:\n\n| Pipe   | Capacity (units/hour) | Cost (dollars/hour) |\n|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| A      | 50                    | 10                  |\n| B      | 30                     | 20                  |\n| C      | 40                     | 15                  |\n| D      | 20                     | 25                  |\n| E      | 60                     | 18                  |\n| F      | 50                     | 22                  |\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of raw material that can be transported per hour from the sources to the storage units while minimizing the total cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total cost while maximizing the flow of raw materials, we need to prioritize the pipes with the lowest cost per unit of capacity. To do this, we will calculate the cost per unit for each pipe and then sort them in ascending order.\n\n| Pipe   | Capacity (units/hour) | Cost (dollars/hour) | Cost per Unit |\n|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| A      | 50                    | 10                  | 0.20          |\n| B      | 30                    | 20                  | 0.67          |\n| C      | 40                    | 15                  | 0.375         |\n| D      | 20                    | 25                  | 1.25          |\n| E      | 60                    | 18                  | 0.30          |\n| F      | 50                    | 22                  | 0.44          |\n\nNow, we will sort the pipes by their cost per unit:\n\n1. Pipe A: 0.20\n2. Pipe E: 0.30\n3. Pipe C: 0.375\n4. Pipe F: 0.44\n5. Pipe B: 0.67\n6. Pipe D: 1.25\n\nWe will start by using the pipes with the lowest cost per unit and continue until we reach the maximum flow rate of 200 units per hour.\n\n1. Pipe A: 50 units/hour\n2. Pipe E: 60 units/hour\n3. Pipe C: 40 units/hour\n4. Pipe F: 50 units/hour\n\nTotal flow rate: 50 + 60 + 40 + 50 = 200 units/hour\n\nWe have reached the maximum flow rate of 200 units per hour using pipes A, E, C, and F. Therefore, the maximum amount of raw material that can be transported per hour from the sources to the storage units while minimizing the total cost is 200 units."
