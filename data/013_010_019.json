    "message_1": "In Cournot Competition, two firms produce identical products and simultaneously choose their output level. Suppose that the demand function for this product is given by Q = 100 – P (where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the market price). The cost function for each firm can be given as C = 10Q, where Q is the quantity produced by the firm. Determine the optimal quantity produced by each firm and the resulting market price.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the reaction function for each firm, which shows the optimal output for each firm given the output of the other firm. Then, we will find the Nash equilibrium, which is the point where both firms are producing their optimal output given the output of the other firm.\n\n1. Find the inverse demand function: P = 100 - Q\n2. Find the total revenue function for each firm: TR = P * q = (100 - Q) * q\n3. Find the profit function for each firm: π = TR - C = (100 - Q) * q - 10q\n4. Find the reaction function for each firm by taking the first-order condition (FOC) of the profit function with respect to q and setting it equal to 0.\n\nLet q1 be the output of firm 1 and q2 be the output of firm 2. Then, Q = q1 + q2.\n\nFor firm 1:\nπ1 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 10q1\nFOC: dπ1/dq1 = 100 - 2q1 - q2 - 10 = 0\n\nFor firm 2:\nπ2 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 10q2\nFOC: dπ2/dq2 = 100 - q1 - 2q2 - 10 = 0\n\n5. Solve the system of equations to find the Nash equilibrium.\n\nFrom the FOC of firm 1: q2 = 90 - 2q1\nSubstitute this into the FOC of firm 2: 100 - q1 - 2(90 - 2q1) - 10 = 0\nSolve for q1: q1 = 30\n\nNow, substitute q1 back into the reaction function for firm 1: q2 = 90 - 2(30) = 30\n\n6. Find the market price using the inverse demand function: P = 100 - Q = 100 - (q1 + q2) = 100 - (30 + 30) = 40\n\nThe optimal quantity produced by each firm is 30 units, and the resulting market price is 40."
