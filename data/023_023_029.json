    "message_2": "To find the frequency spectrum of the signal f(t) = sin(2πt) + sin(4πt) + sin(6πt), we can use the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform of a continuous-time signal f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over all time, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nHowever, in this case, we can directly identify the frequencies and amplitudes of the individual sinusoids that make up the signal without computing the Fourier Transform. This is because the signal is already given as a sum of sinusoids.\n\nThe signal f(t) can be written as:\n\nf(t) = A1 * sin(ω1 * t) + A2 * sin(ω2 * t) + A3 * sin(ω3 * t)\n\nwhere A1 = A2 = A3 = 1 (amplitudes), and ω1 = 2π, ω2 = 4π, ω3 = 6π (angular frequencies).\n\nTo find the frequencies in Hz, we can use the formula:\n\nFrequency (Hz) = Angular frequency / (2π)\n\nSo, the frequencies of the individual sinusoids are:\n\nf1 = ω1 / (2π) = 2π / (2π) = 1 Hz\nf2 = ω2 / (2π) = 4π / (2π) = 2 Hz\nf3 = ω3 / (2π) = 6π / (2π) = 3 Hz\n\nThus, the frequency spectrum of the signal consists of three sinusoids with frequencies 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 3 Hz, and their corresponding amplitudes are all 1."
