    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x-7| = 11, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 7 = 11\nTo solve for x, we first add 7 to both sides of the equation:\n2x = 18\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 2:\nx = 9\n\nCase 2: 2x - 7 = -11\nTo solve for x, we first add 7 to both sides of the equation:\n2x = -4\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 2:\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions for the absolute value equation |2x-7| = 11 are x = 9 and x = -2."
