To find the smallest prime gap between the 1000th and 1001st prime, we first need to find these prime numbers.\n\nThe 1000th prime number is 7,919, and the 1001st prime number is 7,921.\n\nNow, we find the difference between these two prime numbers:\n\n7,921 - 7,919 = 2\n\nThe smallest prime gap between the 1000th prime and the 1001st prime is 2."
