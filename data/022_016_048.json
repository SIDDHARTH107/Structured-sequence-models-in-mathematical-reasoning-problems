    "message_2": "To find the conformal map that transforms the unit disk onto the upper half plane and maps 0 to 0, we can use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$w = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex constants, and ad - bc ≠ 0.\n\nSince we want the map to transform the unit disk onto the upper half plane and map 0 to 0, we can set b = 0:\n\n$$w = \\frac{az}{cz + d}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of a, c, and d that satisfy the conditions. We know that the unit disk's boundary is the circle |z| = 1, and the upper half plane's boundary is the real axis. So, we can use the fact that the Möbius transformation maps circles to circles or lines.\n\nLet's consider three points on the unit circle: z = 1, z = i, and z = -1. We want to find a, c, and d such that the transformed points lie on the real axis.\n\nFor z = 1:\n\n$$w = \\frac{a}{c + d}$$\n\nFor z = i:\n\n$$w = \\frac{ai}{ci + d}$$\n\nFor z = -1:\n\n$$w = \\frac{-a}{-c + d}$$\n\nSince we want the transformed points to lie on the real axis, their imaginary parts should be 0. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\text{Im} \\left(\\frac{ai}{ci + d}\\right) = 0$$\n\n$$\\text{Im} \\left(\\frac{a}{c + d} - \\frac{a}{-c + d}\\right) = 0$$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n$$a = 1, c = i, d = -i$$\n\nSo, the conformal map is:\n\n$$w = \\frac{z}{iz - i}$$\n\nThis is the desired conformal map that transforms the unit disk onto the upper half plane and maps 0 to 0."
