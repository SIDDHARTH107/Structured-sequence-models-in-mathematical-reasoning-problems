    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = (z-1)/(z^2-4) centered at z=2, we first rewrite f(z) in terms of (z-2). We have:\n\nf(z) = (z-1)/((z-2)(z+2))\n\nNow, we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = A/(z-2) + B/(z+2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z-2)(z+2), we get:\n\n(z-1) = A(z+2) + B(z-2)\n\nPlugging in z=2, we get A = 1/4. Plugging in z=-2, we get B = -1/4. Thus,\n\nf(z) = (1/4)/(z-2) - (1/4)/(z+2)\n\nNow, we can write the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\n(1/4)/(z-2) = (1/4) * 1/(1 - (z-2)) = (1/4) * Σ[(z-2)^n] for |z-2| < 1\n- (1/4)/(z+2) = -(1/4) * 1/(1 - (-(z-2))) = -(1/4) * Σ[(-(z-2))^n] for |z-2| > 1\n\nAdding the two series, we get the Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z=2:\n\nf(z) = (1/4) * Σ[(z-2)^n] - (1/4) * Σ[(-(z-2))^n]\n\nThe convergence of this series in the annulus 1<|z-2|<3 is determined by the convergence of each term. The first term converges for |z-2| < 1, and the second term converges for |z-2| > 1. Since the annulus is given by 1<|z-2|<3, both terms converge in the annulus, and thus the Laurent series expansion converges in the annulus 1<|z-2|<3."
