    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 mod p and divides n.\n\nFirst, we factorize 120: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5.\n\nNow, we will find the number of Sylow subgroups for each prime factor:\n\nFor p = 2: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups is denoted by n_2. Since n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2 and divides 120, the possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. \n\nFor p = 3: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups is denoted by n_3. Since n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3 and divides 120, the possible values for n_3 are 1 or 4.\n\nFor p = 5: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups is denoted by n_5. Since n_5 is congruent to 1 mod 5 and divides 120, the possible values for n_5 are 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, there is only one group, which is the cyclic group of order 120, denoted by C_120.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, there is only one group, which is the semidirect product of C_8 and C_15, denoted by C_8 ⋊ C_15.\n\n3. If n_2 = 5, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, there is no group with these Sylow subgroups.\n\n4. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, there are two groups: the direct product of C_8 and C_15, denoted by C_8 × C_15, and the direct product of D_4 and C_15, denoted by D_4 × C_15.\n\n5. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, and n_5 = 1, there is no group with these Sylow subgroups.\n\n6. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 6, there is no group with these Sylow subgroups.\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120: C_120, C_8 ⋊ C_15, C_8 × C_15, D_4 × C_15, and the alternating group A_5 × C_4."
