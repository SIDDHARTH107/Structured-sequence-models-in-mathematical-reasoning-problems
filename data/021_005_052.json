    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.1, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(x, y) representing the differential equation y' = 2xy - y^2.\n2. Initialize the initial values x0 = 0 and y0 = 1.\n3. Set the step size h = 0.1.\n4. Iterate through the Runge-Kutta method to find the value of y(1).\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. f(x, y) = 2xy - y^2\n2. x0 = 0, y0 = 1\n3. h = 0.1\n\nNow, we will iterate 10 times (since we want to find y(1) and h = 0.1) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\nFor each iteration, we will calculate the following:\n\nk1 = h * f(x, y)\nk2 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(x + h, y + k3)\n\ny_new = y + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\nx_new = x + h\n\nAfter 10 iterations, we will get the value of y(1).
