They collected the following data:\n\n| Hours Studied | Test Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| 3 | 70 |\n| 2 | 60 |\n| 5 | 85 |\n| 1 | 50 |\n| 6 | 90 |\n| 4 | 75 |\n\nUsing regression analysis, what is the linear equation that models the relationship between the hours studied and the test score? What is the predicted test score for a student who studies for 7 hours per day?",
    "message_2": "To find the linear equation that models the relationship between the hours studied and the test score, we will use the least squares method for linear regression. First, we need to find the mean of the hours studied (x) and the mean of the test scores (y).\n\nMean of x (hours studied) = (3 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4) / 6 = 21 / 6 = 3.5\nMean of y (test scores) = (70 + 60 + 85 + 50 + 90 + 75) / 6 = 430 / 6 = 71.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (b) of the linear equation using the formula:\n\nb = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / Σ(xi - x_mean)^2\n\nCalculating the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator = (3-3.5)(70-71.67) + (2-3.5)(60-71.67) + (5-3.5)(85-71.67) + (1-3.5)(50-71.67) + (6-3.5)(90-71.67) + (4-3.5)(75-71.67)\nNumerator ≈ -1.67 + 11.67 + 46.65 - 36.17 + 55.65 + 3.33\nNumerator ≈ 79.46\n\nDenominator = (3-3.5)^2 + (2-3.5)^2 + (5-3.5)^2 + (1-3.5)^2 + (6-3.5)^2 + (4-3.5)^2\nDenominator = 0.25 + 2.25 + 2.25 + 6.25 + 6.25 + 0.25\nDenominator = 17.5\n\nNow, we can find the slope (b):\n\nb = 79.46 / 17.5 ≈ 4.54\n\nNext, we find the y-intercept (a) using the formula:\n\na = y_mean - b * x_mean\na = 71.67 - 4.54 * 3.5 ≈ 71.67 - 15.89 ≈ 55.78\n\nSo, the linear equation that models the relationship between the hours studied and the test score is:\n\ny = 55.78 + 4.54x\n\nNow, we can predict the test score for a student who studies for 7 hours per day:\n\ny = 55.78 + 4.54 * 7 ≈ 55.78 + 31.78 ≈ 87.56\n\nThe predicted test score for a student who studies for 7 hours per day is approximately 87.56."
