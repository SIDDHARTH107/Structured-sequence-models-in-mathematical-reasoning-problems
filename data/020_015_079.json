    "message_1": "Suppose you have a rectangular field with a length of 100 meters and a width of 60 meters. You want to fence the field using the least amount of fencing material possible while still enclosing the entire field. What are the dimensions of the rectangular fence that uses the least amount of fencing material?",
    "message_2": "Since the field is already a rectangle with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters, the least amount of fencing material needed would be to enclose the field with a fence that follows the exact dimensions of the field. \n\nTo calculate the amount of fencing material needed, you can use the perimeter formula for a rectangle: P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, L = 100 meters and W = 60 meters.\n\nP = 2(100) + 2(60)\nP = 200 + 120\nP = 320 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular fence that uses the least amount of fencing material are 100 meters by 60 meters, and you would need 320 meters of fencing material to enclose the field."
