    "message_2": "The sparse matrix method is not suitable for this system of linear equations, as there are no zero elements in the matrix. Instead, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve this system.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 6\n| 2  5  7 | 11\n| 3  6  9 | 15\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 3 * Row1\n\n| 1  2  3 | 6\n| 0  1  1 | -1\n| 0  0  0 | 3\n\nWe can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 3, which is inconsistent. This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution."
