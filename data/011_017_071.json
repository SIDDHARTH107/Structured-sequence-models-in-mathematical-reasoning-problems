    "message_2": "The maximum order for a Latin square that can be constructed using the digits 1 to 9 is 9. A Latin square of order n is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, such that each symbol appears exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. Since there are 9 distinct digits (1 to 9), the largest possible Latin square using these digits would be a 9 x 9 array."
