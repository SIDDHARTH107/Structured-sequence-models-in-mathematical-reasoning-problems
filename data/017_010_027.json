    "message_2": "A group G of order 10 has 10 elements. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (groups of order 2) and Sylow 5-subgroups (groups of order 5) must divide the order of the group, which is 10. Therefore, there must be either 1 or 5 Sylow 2-subgroups and either 1 or 2 Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nHowever, since the number of Sylow p-subgroups must be congruent to 1 modulo p, there must be exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup. This Sylow 5-subgroup is normal in G, as it is the only one of its kind. Let's denote this subgroup as H.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is also normal in G. In this case, G would have two normal subgroups, H and the Sylow 2-subgroup, whose orders are coprime (2 and 5). By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G would then be a direct product of these two subgroups, and G would be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\nIf there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, then G cannot be abelian, as there is no unique subgroup of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, which is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. D5 is non-abelian and has order 10.\n\nIn summary, a group G of order 10 can have one of two structures:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10, which is abelian.\n2. G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, which is non-abelian.\n\nThere is no other non-abelian group of order 10, so these are the only two possibilities for the structure of G."
