    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). In the given graph G, the largest complete subgraph is formed by vertices 1, 2, and 4, which form a triangle. No other larger complete subgraphs exist in this graph. Therefore, the clique number of graph G is 3."
