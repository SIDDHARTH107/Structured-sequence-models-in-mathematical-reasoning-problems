    "message_1": "An engineering company needs to design a cylindrical water tank with a height of 8 meters and a radius of 6 meters. The top and bottom of the tank are made of metal costing $50 per square meter, while the curved side is made of a cheaper material costing $30 per square meter. What is the minimum cost of the metal needed to make the tank?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of the metal needed to make the tank, we need to calculate the surface area of the top, bottom, and curved side of the tank and then multiply by their respective costs.\n\n1. Top and bottom of the tank:\nBoth the top and bottom are circles with a radius of 6 meters. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nArea of top = Area of bottom = π(6)^2 = 36π square meters\n\nTotal area of top and bottom = 2 * 36π = 72π square meters\n\nCost of metal for top and bottom = 72π * $50 = 3600π dollars\n\n2. Curved side of the tank:\nThe curved side of the tank is a cylinder with a height of 8 meters and a radius of 6 meters. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nArea of curved side = 2π(6)(8) = 96π square meters\n\nCost of metal for curved side = 96π * $30 = 2880π dollars\n\n3. Total cost of the metal needed:\nTotal cost = Cost of top and bottom + Cost of curved side\nTotal cost = 3600π + 2880π = 6480π dollars\n\nThe minimum cost of the metal needed to make the tank is 6480π dollars, or approximately $20,362.42."
