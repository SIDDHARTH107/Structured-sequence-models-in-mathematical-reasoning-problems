    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of Ext^1(F, G) in D(X) for any coherent sheaves F and G on X, we can use the long exact sequence associated with the sheaf Ext functor and the Serre duality theorem.\n\nFirst, let's recall the long exact sequence associated with the sheaf Ext functor. Given a short exact sequence of coherent sheaves on X:\n\n0 → G → H → F → 0,\n\nwe have the long exact sequence of Ext groups:\n\n0 → Hom(F, G) → Hom(F, H) → Hom(F, F) → Ext^1(F, G) → Ext^1(F, H) → Ext^1(F, F) → ...\n\nNow, let's use the Serre duality theorem, which states that for any coherent sheaves F and G on a smooth projective variety X of dimension n, we have:\n\nExt^i(F, G) ≅ Ext^(n-i)(G, F ⊗ ω_X)^*,\n\nwhere ω_X is the canonical sheaf of X and (-)^* denotes the dual.\n\nIn our case, X is a smooth projective variety of dimension 2, and the canonical sheaf ω_X is given by the line bundle O_X(-3), since X is a quadric surface in P^2. Thus, we have:\n\nExt^1(F, G) ≅ Ext^1(G, F ⊗ O_X(-3))^*.\n\nNow, let's consider the short exact sequence of coherent sheaves on X:\n\n0 → G → H → F ⊗ O_X(-3) → 0.\n\nApplying the long exact sequence of Ext groups, we get:\n\n0 → Hom(F ⊗ O_X(-3), G) → Hom(F ⊗ O_X(-3), H) → Hom(F ⊗ O_X(-3), F ⊗ O_X(-3)) → Ext^1(F ⊗ O_X(-3), G) → ...\n\nTaking the dual of this sequence, we obtain:\n\n... → Ext^1(F ⊗ O_X(-3), G)^* → Hom(F ⊗ O_X(-3), F ⊗ O_X(-3))^* → Hom(F ⊗ O_X(-3), H)^* → Hom(F ⊗ O_X(-3), G)^* → 0.\n\nComparing this sequence with the one obtained from Serre duality, we deduce that:\n\ndim Ext^1(F, G) = dim Ext^1(F ⊗ O_X(-3), G)^* = dim Hom(F ⊗ O_X(-3), G).\n\nThus, the dimension of Ext^1(F, G) in D(X) for any coherent sheaves F and G on X is given by the dimension of the space of morphisms between F ⊗ O_X(-3) and G."
