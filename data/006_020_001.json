    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, people owning a pet) in n trials (the group of 10 people)\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (n! / (x!(n-x)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a person owning a pet, which is 70% or 0.7)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10 people)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, at least 7 people owning a pet)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 7 people owning a pet, we will calculate the probabilities for 7, 8, 9, and 10 people owning a pet and sum them up.\n\nP(at least 7) = P(7) + P(8) + P(9) + P(10)\n\nFirst, we will calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(7) = C(10, 7) * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3\nP(8) = C(10, 8) * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2\nP(9) = C(10, 9) * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1\nP(10) = C(10, 10) * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0\n\nNow, we will calculate the combinations:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!3!) = 120\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8!2!) = 45\nC(10, 9) = 10! / (9!1!) = 10\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10!0!) = 1\n\nNow, we will plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(7) = 120 * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3 ≈ 0.2668\nP(8) = 45 * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2 ≈ 0.2335\nP(9) = 10 * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1 ≈ 0.1211\nP(10) = 1 * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0 ≈ 0.0282\n\nFinally, we will sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(at least 7) = 0.2668 + 0.2335 + 0.1211 + 0.0282 ≈ 0.6496\n\nSo, the probability that at least 7 out of 10 randomly selected people from the community own a pet is approximately 64.96%."
