    "message_2": "1. To find all the points (x, y) in the affine plane such that f(x, y) = 1, we need to solve the equation:\n\n(4x^2 + 4xy + y^2)/(3x^2 + 3y^2) = 1\n\nWe can cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction:\n\n4x^2 + 4xy + y^2 = 3x^2 + 3y^2\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to isolate the terms with x and y:\n\nx^2 - 2y^2 + 4xy = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\nx^2 - 2y^2 + 4xy = (x + 2y)^2 - 4y^2 = 0\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: x + 2y = 0\nIn this case, x = -2y. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n(-2y)^2 - 2y^2 + 4(-2y)y = 0\n4y^2 - 2y^2 - 8y^2 = 0\n-6y^2 = 0\n\nThis implies that y = 0, and since x = -2y, we have x = 0 as well. So, the point (0, 0) satisfies the equation.\n\nCase 2: x^2 - 4y^2 = 0\nIn this case, we have:\n\nx^2 = 4y^2\nx^2/4 = y^2\nx^2 = (2y)^2\n\nThis implies that x = ±2y. So, the points (x, y) satisfying the equation are of the form (2y, y) and (-2y, y), where y is any real number.\n\nThus, the points (x, y) in the affine plane such that f(x, y) = 1 are (0, 0), (2y, y), and (-2y, y) for any real number y.\n\n2. Now, we want to determine whether there exists a rational function g(x, y) such that f = g^2. If such a function exists, then:\n\nf(x, y) = g(x, y)^2\n(4x^2 + 4xy + y^2)/(3x^2 + 3y^2) = g(x, y)^2\n\nNotice that f(x, y) is always non-negative, since both the numerator and denominator are sums of squares. Therefore, it is possible for f(x, y) to be the square of another rational function.\n\nLet's consider the case when f(x, y) = 1, which we found in part 1. We have:\n\ng(x, y)^2 = 1\n\nThis implies that g(x, y) = ±1. However, g(x, y) must be a rational function, so it cannot be both 1 and -1 at the same time. Therefore, there does not exist a rational function g(x, y) such that f = g^2."
