    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types (Type A and Type B) of products. The profit from each unit of Type A is $10 and from each unit of Type B is $15. The company has a production capacity of 1000 units per day, and it must produce at least 300 units of Type A and 400 units of Type B to meet the market demands. Moreover, due to storage constraints, it cannot store more than 600 units of Type A and 800 units of Type B at the end of the day. Using convex optimization, determine the number of units of each type that the company should produce per day to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Type A produced and y be the number of units of Type B produced. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 1000\n2. Minimum production constraints: x ≥ 300, y ≥ 400\n3. Storage constraints: x ≤ 600, y ≤ 800\n\nWe can solve this problem using the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we need to find the feasible region, which is the intersection of all the constraint inequalities.\n\nThe feasible region is a convex polygon with vertices at the points (300, 400), (300, 600), (600, 400), and (600, 800). Now, we need to evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. P(300, 400) = 10(300) + 15(400) = 9000\n2. P(300, 600) = 10(300) + 15(600) = 12000\n3. P(600, 400) = 10(600) + 15(400) = 12000\n4. P(600, 800) = 10(600) + 15(800) = 18000\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (600, 800), with a profit of $18,000. Therefore, the company should produce 600 units of Type A and 800 units of Type B per day to maximize its profit."
