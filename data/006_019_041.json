    "message_1": "In a country, there are three major political parties: Party A, Party B, and Party C. A survey of a random sample of 1000 voters was conducted, and it was found that 540 voters support Party A, 360 voters support Party B, and 100 voters support Party C. What is the probability that a randomly selected voter from this country supports Party A?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected voter supports Party A, we need to divide the number of voters supporting Party A by the total number of voters surveyed.\n\nProbability = (Number of voters supporting Party A) / (Total number of voters surveyed)\n\nProbability = 540 / 1000\n\nProbability = 0.54\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected voter from this country supports Party A is 0.54 or 54%."
