At point $P=\\langle 0, 1, 1\\rangle$ on the curve, the particle has a velocity vector of $\\langle 1, 0, 0\\rangle$. Determine the parallel transport of the velocity vector as the particle moves along the curve from $P$ to the point $Q=\\langle-1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/2\\rangle$.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the velocity vector, we need to find the covariant derivative of the velocity vector along the curve. Let's first find the tangent vector of the curve at any point $t$.\n\nThe tangent vector is given by the derivative of the position vector $r(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$r'(t) = \\langle -\\sin(t), \\cos(t), 2\\sin(t)\\cos(t) \\rangle$\n\nNow, let's find the covariant derivative of the velocity vector $v = \\langle 1, 0, 0 \\rangle$ along the curve. The covariant derivative is given by:\n\n$D_v(r'(t)) = \\nabla_v r'(t) = v^i \\nabla_i r'(t)$\n\nwhere $\\nabla_i$ is the covariant derivative with respect to the $i$-th coordinate and $v^i$ is the $i$-th component of the velocity vector. In our case, $v^i = (1, 0, 0)$, so we only need to consider the covariant derivative with respect to the first coordinate:\n\n$D_v(r'(t)) = \\nabla_1 r'(t)$\n\nNow, let's compute the covariant derivative of each component of $r'(t)$ with respect to the first coordinate:\n\n$\\nabla_1 (-\\sin(t)) = -\\cos(t)$\n\n$\\nabla_1 (\\cos(t)) = -\\sin(t)$\n\n$\\nabla_1 (2\\sin(t)\\cos(t)) = 2\\cos^2(t) - 2\\sin^2(t)$\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of $r'(t)$ with respect to the first coordinate is:\n\n$D_v(r'(t)) = \\langle -\\cos(t), -\\sin(t), 2\\cos^2(t) - 2\\sin^2(t) \\rangle$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of this vector at points $P$ and $Q$. At point $P$, we have $t = \\pi/2$, so:\n\n$D_v(r'(\\pi/2)) = \\langle 0, -1, -1 \\rangle$\n\nAt point $Q$, we have $t = 3\\pi/4$, so:\n\n$D_v(r'(3\\pi/4)) = \\langle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0 \\rangle$\n\nThe parallel transport of the velocity vector from point $P$ to point $Q$ is given by the difference between these two vectors:\n\n$\\Delta v = D_v(r'(3\\pi/4)) - D_v(r'(\\pi/2)) = \\langle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 1 \\rangle$\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the velocity vector as the particle moves along the curve from $P$ to $Q$ is $\\boxed{\\langle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 1 \\rangle}$."
