    "message_1": "In a factor analysis of a dataset containing 10 variables, it was found that the first two factors explained 50% and 30% of the total variance, respectively. What is the percentage of the total variance explained by the rest of the factors?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of the total variance explained by the rest of the factors, we need to subtract the percentages explained by the first two factors from 100%.\n\nPercentage of total variance explained by the rest of the factors = 100% - (50% + 30%)\n\nPercentage of total variance explained by the rest of the factors = 100% - 80%\n\nPercentage of total variance explained by the rest of the factors = 20%\n\nSo, the rest of the factors explain 20% of the total variance."
