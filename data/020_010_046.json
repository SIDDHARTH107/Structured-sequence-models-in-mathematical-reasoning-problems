    "message_1": "A manufacturer is producing two types of items: Type A and Type B. The profit margin for each Type A item is $10, and the profit margin for each Type B item is $15. The manufacturer has 100 units of raw materials and can produce a maximum of 50 Type A items and 40 Type B items. However, due to fluctuations in the market demand, the manufacturer wants to make sure that the profit margin is at least $500, regardless of how demand changes. What is the minimum number of Type A and Type B items that the manufacturer needs to produce to meet this requirement?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Type A items and y be the number of Type B items. We want to find the minimum values of x and y that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The profit margin should be at least $500: 10x + 15y ≥ 500\n2. The manufacturer can produce a maximum of 50 Type A items: x ≤ 50\n3. The manufacturer can produce a maximum of 40 Type B items: y ≤ 40\n\nWe can start by finding the minimum number of Type B items needed to reach a profit margin of $500. To do this, we can set x to 0 and solve for y:\n\n10(0) + 15y ≥ 500\n15y ≥ 500\ny ≥ 500/15\ny ≥ 33.33\n\nSince y must be a whole number, the minimum number of Type B items is 34. Now we can find the minimum number of Type A items needed to reach a profit margin of $500 with 34 Type B items:\n\n10x + 15(34) ≥ 500\n10x + 510 ≥ 500\n10x ≥ -10\nx ≥ -1\n\nSince x must be a non-negative whole number, the minimum number of Type A items is 0.\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer needs to produce a minimum of 0 Type A items and 34 Type B items to meet the requirement of a profit margin of at least $500."
