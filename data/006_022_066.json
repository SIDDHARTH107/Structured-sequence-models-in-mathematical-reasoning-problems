    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student has not enrolled in an advanced math course, we first need to determine the number of students who have not enrolled in the course.\n\nSince 60% of the students have enrolled in the advanced math course, that means 40% have not enrolled in the course. To find the number of students who have not enrolled, we can multiply the total number of students (600) by the percentage of students who have not enrolled (40%).\n\n600 * 0.40 = 240 students\n\nNow, to find the probability of selecting a student who has not enrolled in the advanced math course, we can divide the number of students who have not enrolled (240) by the total number of students (600).\n\nProbability = (Number of students who have not enrolled) / (Total number of students)\nProbability = 240 / 600\n\nProbability = 0.4 or 40%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from this high school has not enrolled in an advanced math course is 40%."
