    "message_2": "The given trigonometric function is y = 3 cos(2x - π/4) + 1.\n\n1. Amplitude:\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\n2. Period:\nThe period of the cosine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of x inside the cosine function. In this case, B = 2, so the period is (2π) / 2 = π.\n\n3. Phase Shift:\nThe phase shift is the value of C / B, where C is the constant added or subtracted inside the cosine function. In this case, C = -π/4, so the phase shift is (-π/4) / 2 = -π/8. This means the graph is shifted to the right by π/8 units.\n\nTo graph the function, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw the x and y axes.\n2. Mark the amplitude on the y-axis (3 units above and below the horizontal axis).\n3. Mark the period on the x-axis (π units).\n4. Shift the graph to the right by the phase shift (π/8 units).\n5. Sketch the cosine function with the given amplitude, period, and phase shift.\n6. Finally, shift the entire graph vertically up by 1 unit (add 1 to the y-coordinates).\n\nThe graph of y = 3 cos(2x - π/4) + 1 will have an amplitude of 3, a period of π, and a phase shift of -π/8 to the right, and it will be shifted 1 unit up."
