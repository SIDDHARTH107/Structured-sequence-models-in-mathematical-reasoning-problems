    "message_2": "The maximum number of steps required by a deterministic algorithm to sort a list of n numbers using comparison-based sorting techniques is given by the worst-case complexity of the algorithm. For comparison-based sorting algorithms, the worst-case complexity is O(n log n).\n\nTo understand why this is the case, consider that there are n! (n factorial) possible permutations of a list of n numbers. A comparison-based sorting algorithm can be represented as a decision tree, where each internal node represents a comparison between two elements, and each leaf node represents a sorted permutation. In the worst case, the algorithm must be able to distinguish between all n! possible permutations.\n\nThe maximum number of leaves in a binary tree of height h is 2^h. To accommodate n! permutations, we need a tree with at least n! leaves. Therefore, we have:\n\n2^h ≥ n!\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\nh ≥ log2(n!)\n\nUsing Stirling's approximation for large n, we know that n! is approximately (n/e)^n * sqrt(2*pi*n). Taking the logarithm base 2 of this approximation, we get:\n\nlog2(n!) ≈ n * log2(n/e) + log2(sqrt(2*pi*n))\n\nSince we are interested in the worst-case complexity, we can focus on the dominant term, which is n * log2(n). Therefore, the maximum number of steps required by a deterministic algorithm to sort a list of n numbers using comparison-based sorting techniques is O(n log n)."
