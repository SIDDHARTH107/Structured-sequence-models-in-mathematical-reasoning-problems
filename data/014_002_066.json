    "message_2": "In a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Alice and Bob agree on a common base (g) and a large prime number (p). In this case, the common base is 3. However, the prime number (p) is not provided. Let's assume a prime number, for example, p = 17.\n\n1. Alice chooses a private key (a) of 5 and calculates her public key (A) using the formula A = g^a mod p. In this case, A = 3^5 mod 17.\n2. Bob chooses a private key (b) of 7 and calculates his public key (B) using the formula B = g^b mod p. In this case, B = 3^7 mod 17.\n\nNow, Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.\n\n3. Alice receives Bob's public key (B) and calculates the shared secret key (s) using the formula s = B^a mod p. In this case, s = B^5 mod 17.\n4. Bob receives Alice's public key (A) and calculates the shared secret key (s) using the formula s = A^b mod p. In this case, s = A^7 mod 17.\n\nIf the calculations are correct, both Alice and Bob will have the same shared secret key (s).\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\nA = 3^5 mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 12\nB = 3^7 mod 17 = 2187 mod 17 = 10\n\nNow, let's calculate the shared secret key (s) for both Alice and Bob:\n\ns (for Alice) = B^5 mod 17 = 10^5 mod 17 = 100000 mod 17 = 3\ns (for Bob) = A^7 mod 17 = 12^7 mod 17 = 35831808 mod 17 = 3\n\nThe shared secret key (s) is 3."
