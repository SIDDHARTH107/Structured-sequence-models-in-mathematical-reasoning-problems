If set C is a subset of set D, we can denote it as C ⊆ D.\n\n1. To verify that A ∩ B is a subset of set A:\n\nA ∩ B = {6} and A = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nSince 6 is an element of set A, we can say that A ∩ B ⊆ A.\n\n2. To verify that A ∩ B is a subset of set B:\n\nA ∩ B = {6} and B = {3, 6, 9}\n\nSince 6 is an element of set B, we can say that A ∩ B ⊆ B.\n\nTherefore, we have verified that the intersection of set A and set B (A ∩ B) is a subset of set A and also a subset of set B."
