    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of material used in the construction of the cylindrical can, we need to minimize its surface area. The volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. The surface area of a cylinder is given by $A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh$.\n\nWe are given that the volume of the can is $200\\pi \\text{ cm}^3$. So, we have:\n\n$200\\pi = \\pi r^2 h$\n\nNow, we need to express the height $h$ in terms of the radius $r$:\n\n$h = \\frac{200}{r^2}$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $h$ into the surface area formula:\n\n$A(r) = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r \\left(\\frac{200}{r^2}\\right)$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$A(r) = 2\\pi r^2 + 400\\pi\\frac{1}{r}$\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we need to find the critical points of the function $A(r)$. We do this by taking the derivative of $A(r)$ with respect to $r$ and setting it equal to 0:\n\n$\\frac{dA}{dr} = 4\\pi r - 400\\pi\\frac{1}{r^2} = 0$\n\nNow, we solve for $r$:\n\n$4\\pi r^3 - 400\\pi = 0$\n\n$r^3 = \\frac{400}{4}$\n\n$r^3 = 100$\n\n$r = \\sqrt[3]{100}$\n\nNow, we substitute this value of $r$ back into the expression for $h$:\n\n$h = \\frac{200}{(\\sqrt[3]{100})^2}$\n\n$h = \\frac{200}{\\frac{100}{\\sqrt[3]{100}}}$\n\n$h = 2\\sqrt[3]{100}$\n\nSo, the dimensions of the cylindrical can that minimize the amount of material used in its construction are:\n\nRadius: $r = \\sqrt[3]{100} \\text{ cm}$\n\nHeight: $h = 2\\sqrt[3]{100} \\text{ cm}$"
