    "message_2": "A group of order 96 can be factored as 96 = 2^5 * 3. According to Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (denoted as n_2) must divide the order of the group and also satisfy the condition n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible divisors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96. Among these, the numbers that satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) are 1, 3, and 15. Therefore, the possible number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 96 are 1, 3, and 15.\n\nTo determine the isomorphism type of the group, we can analyze the possible cases:\n\n1. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it is normal in the group. In this case, the group would be a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup (of order 32) and the Sylow 3-subgroup (of order 3). The Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to either Z_32, Z_2 x Z_16, Z_4 x Z_8, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_8, or Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_4. The Sylow 3-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_3. Since there are different possible semi-direct products, we cannot determine a unique isomorphism type in this case.\n\n2. If there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, then the group cannot be a simple group, as there is no simple group of order 96. Thus, we cannot determine a unique isomorphism type in this case either.\n\n3. If there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, then the group cannot be a simple group, as there is no simple group of order 96. Thus, we cannot determine a unique isomorphism type in this case either.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot determine a unique isomorphism type for the group of order 96 based solely on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups."
