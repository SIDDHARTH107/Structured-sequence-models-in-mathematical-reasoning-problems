    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = sin(3x) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's denote the inner function as u = 3x. Then, the outer function is y = sin(u).\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\ndy/du = cos(u)\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\ndu/dx = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\ndy/dx = dy/du * du/dx\n\nSubstitute the derivatives we found:\ndy/dx = cos(u) * 3\n\nFinally, substitute the original inner function u = 3x back into the equation:\ndy/dx = cos(3x) * 3\n\nSo, the derivative of y = sin(3x) with respect to x is:\ndy/dx = 3cos(3x)"
