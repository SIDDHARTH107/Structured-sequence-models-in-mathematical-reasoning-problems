    "message_2": "To prove that the formula [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] → (p → r) is a tautology using natural deduction, we will use the following rules of inference: Modus Ponens (MP), Conjunction Introduction (∧I), and Implication Introduction (→I). \n\nWe will assume the antecedent [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] and show that the consequent (p → r) follows from it. Here's the proof:\n\n1. (p → q) ∧ (q → r) (Assumption)\n2. p → q (1, ∧-Elimination)\n3. q → r (1, ∧-Elimination)\n4. Assume p (Assumption)\n5. q (2, 4, Modus Ponens)\n6. r (3, 5, Modus Ponens)\n7. p → r (4-6, Implication Introduction)\n8. [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] → (p → r) (1-7, Implication Introduction)\n\nThus, the formula [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] → (p → r) is a tautology, as we have shown that assuming the antecedent leads to the consequent using natural deduction rules."
