    "message_2": "To form a committee with at least 2 women and 2 men, we can have the following compositions:\n\n1. 2 women and 3 men\n2. 3 women and 2 men\n\nWe will calculate the number of ways to form a committee for each composition and then add them together.\n\n1. 2 women and 3 men:\nThere are 8 women and we need to choose 2, which can be done in C(8,2) ways. There are 12 men and we need to choose 3, which can be done in C(12,3) ways. So, the total number of ways for this composition is C(8,2) * C(12,3).\n\nC(8,2) = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = 28\nC(12,3) = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!) = 220\n\nSo, the total number of ways for this composition is 28 * 220 = 6160.\n\n2. 3 women and 2 men:\nThere are 8 women and we need to choose 3, which can be done in C(8,3) ways. There are 12 men and we need to choose 2, which can be done in C(12,2) ways. So, the total number of ways for this composition is C(8,3) * C(12,2).\n\nC(8,3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 56\nC(12,2) = 12! / (2! * (12-2)!) = 66\n\nSo, the total number of ways for this composition is 56 * 66 = 3696.\n\nNow, we add the number of ways for both compositions: 6160 + 3696 = 9856.\n\nTherefore, there are 9856 ways to form a 5-person committee with at least 2 women and 2 men."
