    "message_2": "To find the exponent x that solves the discrete logarithm problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer x such that 7 ≡ 3^x (mod 17).\n\nWe can start by calculating the powers of 3 modulo 17:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3^3 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n3^4 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n3^5 ≡ 5 (mod 17)\n3^6 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n3^7 ≡ 11 (mod 17)\n3^8 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n3^9 ≡ 14 (mod 17)\n3^10 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n3^11 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n\nWe find that 3^11 ≡ 7 (mod 17), so the exponent x that solves the discrete logarithm problem is x = 11."
