    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted by S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we have n = 7 elements and we want to partition them into k = 3 non-empty subsets.\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind, we can find the answer as S(7, 3).\n\nThere is a recursive formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nUsing this formula, we can compute S(7, 3) as follows:\n\nS(7, 3) = 3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2)\n\nNow, we need to compute S(6, 3) and S(6, 2):\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\nS(6, 2) = 2 * S(5, 2) + S(5, 1)\n\nContinuing the calculations:\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\nS(5, 1) = 1 (since S(n, 1) = 1 for all n)\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\nS(4, 1) = 1 (since S(n, 1) = 1 for all n)\n\nS(3, 3) = 1 (since S(n, n) = 1 for all n)\nS(3, 2) = 3 (it can be computed directly or using the formula)\nS(3, 1) = 1 (since S(n, 1) = 1 for all n)\n\nNow we can substitute the values back:\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 2) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\nS(6, 2) = 2 * 15 + 1 = 31\n\nFinally, we get:\n\nS(7, 3) = 3 * 90 + 31 = 270 + 31 = 301\n\nSo, there are 301 ways to partition a set of 7 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets."
