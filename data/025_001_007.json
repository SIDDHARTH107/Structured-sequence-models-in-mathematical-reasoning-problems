    "message_2": "To find the number of common intersections of the given curves using Bezout's theorem, we first need to express the curves as polynomial equations in two variables. The given curves are:\n\n1. $y = x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 2$\n2. $y = 2x - 1$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equations as:\n\n1. $F(x, y) = y - x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = 0$\n2. $G(x, y) = y - 2x + 1 = 0$\n\nBezout's theorem states that the number of common intersections of two curves defined by polynomial equations $F(x, y) = 0$ and $G(x, y) = 0$ is equal to the product of the degrees of the polynomials, assuming that the curves have no common components and the intersections are counted with multiplicity.\n\nThe degree of $F(x, y)$ is 3 (since the highest degree term is $x^3$), and the degree of $G(x, y)$ is 1 (since the highest degree term is $2x$). Therefore, according to Bezout's theorem, the number of common intersections of the curves is:\n\n$3 \\times 1 = 3$\n\nSo, the curves $y = x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 2$ and $y = 2x - 1$ have 3 common intersections."
