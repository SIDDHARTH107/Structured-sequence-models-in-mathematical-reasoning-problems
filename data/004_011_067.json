    "message_2": "Let V be the volume of the water in the tank, h be the height of the water, and r be the radius of the water surface at height h. We are given that the volume of the water is increasing at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute, so dV/dt = 2.\n\nThe volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)πr^2h. We need to find dh/dt when h = 3 meters.\n\nSince the water tank is also a cone, the ratio of the radius to the height is constant:\n\nr/h = 5/10\nr = h/2\n\nNow, we can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:\n\ndV/dt = (1/3)π(2rh * dr/dt + r^2 * dh/dt)\n\nWe know dV/dt = 2, and we can substitute r = h/2:\n\n2 = (1/3)π((h^2 * (1/2) * dh/dt) + (h^2/4) * dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can solve for dh/dt when h = 3:\n\n2 = (1/3)π((3^2 * (1/2) * dh/dt) + (3^2/4) * dh/dt)\n\n2 = (1/3)π(9/2 * dh/dt + 9/4 * dh/dt)\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/π:\n\n6/π = 9/2 * dh/dt + 9/4 * dh/dt\n\nCombine the terms with dh/dt:\n\n6/π = (9/2 + 9/4) * dh/dt\n\n6/π = (18 + 9)/4 * dh/dt\n\n6/π = 27/4 * dh/dt\n\nNow, solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = (6/π) * (4/27)\n\ndh/dt = 24/(27π)\n\nSo, the water level is rising at a rate of 24/(27π) meters per minute when the water is 3 meters deep in the tank."
