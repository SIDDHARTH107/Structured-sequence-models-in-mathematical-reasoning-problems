    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 13 cm and one leg of 5 cm. Find the length of the other leg.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In other words, a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\n\nIn this case, we are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 13 cm) and the length of one leg (a = 5 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up the equation:\n\n5^2 + b^2 = 13^2\n\n25 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 169 - 25\nb^2 = 144\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), we take the square root of 144:\n\nb = âˆš144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
