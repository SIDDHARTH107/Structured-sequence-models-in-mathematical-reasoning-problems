    "message_1": "A student needs to choose a team of 5 students from a group of 8 students. However, they need to ensure that the team consists of 2 students majoring in mathematics, 2 students majoring in computer science, and 1 student majoring in engineering. How many different teams can they form if there are 3 math majors, 4 computer science majors, and 2 engineering majors available?",
    "message_2": "To form a team, the student needs to choose 2 math majors from 3 available, 2 computer science majors from 4 available, and 1 engineering major from 2 available.\n\nWe can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose the students for each major:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFor math majors:\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3! / (2!1!) = (3*2*1) / (2*1*1) = 3\n\nFor computer science majors:\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2!2!) = (4*3*2*1) / (2*1*2*1) = 6\n\nFor engineering majors:\nC(2, 1) = 2! / (1!(2-1)!) = 2! / (1!1!) = (2*1) / (1*1) = 2\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to choose students from each major to find the total number of different teams:\n\nTotal teams = (Math majors) * (Computer Science majors) * (Engineering majors)\nTotal teams = 3 * 6 * 2 = 36\n\nSo, the student can form 36 different teams."
