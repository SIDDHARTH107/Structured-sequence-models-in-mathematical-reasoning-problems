    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products A and B. The profit made from selling one unit of A is $10 and one unit of B is $20. The company has two machines that can be used to produce these products, and each machine has a limited availability. Machine 1 can be used for 5 hours to produce one unit of A and 10 hours to produce one unit of B. Machine 2 can be used for 15 hours to produce one unit of A and 5 hours to produce one unit of B. If the company has a maximum of 60 hours available on Machine 1 and 75 hours available on Machine 2, how many units of each product should be manufactured to maximize the profit?",

However, since we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, the company should produce 3 units of product A and 4 units of product B to achieve a profit of $110."
