    "message_2": "To find the Christoffel symbols of the given metric tensor g, we first need to compute its inverse g^(-1). The metric tensor g is given by:\n\ng = | 2  1 |\n    | 1  2 |\n\nTo find the inverse of g, we first compute the determinant of g:\n\ndet(g) = (2)(2) - (1)(1) = 4 - 1 = 3\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of g:\n\ng^(-1) = (1/det(g)) * |  2  -1 |\n                      | -1   2 |\n\ng^(-1) = (1/3) * |  2  -1 |\n                 | -1   2 |\n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols Γ^k_ij using the formula:\n\nΓ^k_ij = 0.5 * g^(k,l) * (∂g_ij/∂x^l + ∂g_ji/∂x^l - ∂g_li/∂x^j)\n\nSince the metric tensor g is constant, all its partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates x^i, x^j, and x^l are zero. Therefore, all the Christoffel symbols Γ^k_ij will be zero as well."
