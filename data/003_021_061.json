    "message_2": "Let's denote the velocity of the first plane as vector A and the velocity of the second plane as vector B. We want to find the angle θ between these two vectors.\n\nVector A can be decomposed into its horizontal (eastward) and vertical (northward) components. Since the plane is flying towards the northeast direction, the angle between the horizontal and vertical components is 45 degrees. Using trigonometry, we can find the components as follows:\n\nA_horizontal = A * cos(45°) = 450 * cos(45°) = 450 * (√2 / 2) = 225√2 mph\nA_vertical = A * sin(45°) = 450 * sin(45°) = 450 * (√2 / 2) = 225√2 mph\n\nVector B is flying towards the north direction, so it has no horizontal component:\n\nB_horizontal = 0 mph\nB_vertical = 500 mph\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ between the two vectors using the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nThe dot product of A and B is:\n\nA · B = (A_horizontal * B_horizontal) + (A_vertical * B_vertical)\nA · B = (225√2 * 0) + (225√2 * 500) = 0 + 112500√2\n\nThe magnitudes of A and B are:\n\n|A| = √(A_horizontal^2 + A_vertical^2) = √((225√2)^2 + (225√2)^2) = 450\n|B| = √(B_horizontal^2 + B_vertical^2) = √(0^2 + 500^2) = 500\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| * |B|)\ncos(θ) = (112500√2) / (450 * 500)\ncos(θ) = 0.5\n\nFinally, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(0.5)\nθ = 60°\n\nSo, the angle between the two planes is 60 degrees."
