    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A and B are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √(2² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNext, we need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of the vectors A and B. To find the dot product, we multiply the corresponding components of the vectors and sum the results:\n\nA · B = (3 * 2) + (4 * 5) = 6 + 20 = 26\n\nNow we can find the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = 26 / (5 * √29) ≈ 0.949\n\nθ ≈ arccos(0.949) ≈ 18.19°\n\nFinally, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * 0.949 ≈ 26\n\nSo, the dot product of vector A and vector B using trigonometry is approximately 26."
