    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 fishermen who share a common fishing ground. Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 5 fish per day, but the total population of fish in the area can only support a maximum of 30 fish caught per day. If the fishermen work together to catch the fish sustainably, what is the maximum number of fish that each fisherman can catch? What happens if one fisherman decides to catch more than 5 fish per day?",
    "message_2": "To catch the fish sustainably, the 10 fishermen need to ensure that they do not catch more than 30 fish per day in total. To find the maximum number of fish each fisherman can catch, we can divide the total sustainable catch by the number of fishermen:\n\n30 fish / 10 fishermen = 3 fish per fisherman\n\nSo, each fisherman can catch a maximum of 3 fish per day to maintain the sustainability of the fishing ground.\n\nIf one fisherman decides to catch more than 5 fish per day, it will disrupt the balance and may lead to overfishing. Since the total sustainable catch is 30 fish per day, if one fisherman catches more than 5 fish, the total catch will exceed the sustainable limit. This will result in a decrease in the fish population, making it harder for the fishermen to catch fish in the future and potentially leading to the collapse of the fishing ground."
