    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products - Product A and Product B. The profit per unit for Product A is $6 and for Product B is $8. Each unit of Product A requires 5 units of resource X and 3 units of resource Y, while each unit of Product B requires 4 units of resource X and 6 units of resource Y. The company has a total of 300 units of resource X and 180 units of resource Y. What is the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 6x + 8y.\n\nThe constraints are given by the availability of resources X and Y:\n\n5x + 4y ≤ 300 (resource X constraint)\n3x + 6y ≤ 180 (resource Y constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint inequalities and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the constraints as equalities and solve for y:\n\n5x + 4y = 300 => y = (300 - 5x) / 4\n3x + 6y = 180 => y = (180 - 3x) / 6\n\nNow, we plot these lines along with the non-negativity constraints x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all constraints. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 15), and (60, 0).\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 6x + 8y at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 6(0) + 8(0) = 0\nP(0, 30) = 6(0) + 8(30) = 240\nP(20, 15) = 6(20) + 8(15) = 240\nP(60, 0) = 6(60) + 8(0) = 360\n\nThe maximum profit is $360, which occurs when the company produces 60 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B."
