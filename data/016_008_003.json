    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 4 new segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. Therefore, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after four iterations is approximately 1.2619, regardless of the number of iterations. The dimension remains constant as the curve becomes more complex with each iteration."
