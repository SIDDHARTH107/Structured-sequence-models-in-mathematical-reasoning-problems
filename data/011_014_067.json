    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of cycles in a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the concept of complete graphs. A complete graph is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n\nA complete graph with n vertices has n*(n-1)/2 edges. In our case, we have 7 vertices, so a complete graph would have 7*(7-1)/2 = 21 edges. However, we only have 10 edges, so we cannot form a complete graph.\n\nTo maximize the number of cycles, we can try to form a graph with the maximum number of vertices that can be connected with 10 edges. We can use the formula n*(n-1)/2 = 10 to find the maximum number of vertices that can be connected with 10 edges. Solving for n, we get n â‰ˆ 4.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a vertex, we can use 4 vertices to form a complete graph with 6 edges.\n\nNow, we have 4 more edges to connect the remaining 3 vertices. We can connect each of these vertices to the existing 4-vertex complete graph, forming 3 additional cycles. In total, we have:\n\n- 1 cycle in the 4-vertex complete graph (formed by the 4 vertices)\n- 3 additional cycles formed by connecting the remaining 3 vertices to the 4-vertex complete graph\n\nSo, the maximum number of cycles that can be present in the graph is 1 + 3 = 4 cycles."
