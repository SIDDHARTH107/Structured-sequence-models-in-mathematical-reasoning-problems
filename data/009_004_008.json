    "message_2": "To determine the equation of motion for the mass-spring system, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nNewton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\n\nF = ma\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and a is its acceleration.\n\nCombining these two equations, we get:\n\nma = -kx\n\nSince acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\nm(d^2x/dt^2) = -kx\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to get:\n\n(d^2x/dt^2) + (k/m)x = 0\n\nGiven the mass (m = 0.2 kg) and the spring constant (k = 25 N/m), we can plug in these values:\n\n(d^2x/dt^2) + (25/0.2)x = 0\n\n(d^2x/dt^2) + 125x = 0\n\nThis is the equation of motion for the mass-spring system.\n\nTo find the period of oscillation, we can use the formula for the period of a mass-spring system:\n\nT = 2π√(m/k)\n\nPlugging in the values for m and k, we get:\n\nT = 2π√(0.2/25)\n\nT = 2π√(0.008)\n\nT ≈ 0.56 s\n\nSo, the period of oscillation of the mass-spring system is approximately 0.56 seconds."
