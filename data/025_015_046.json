Find two vectors lying on the plane by subtracting the coordinates of the given points.\n2. Calculate the cross product of these two vectors to find the normal vector of the plane.\n3. Use the normal vector and any of the given points to find the equation of the plane.\n\nStep 1: Find two vectors lying on the plane\nVector A = (-1,5,4) - (2,1,3) = (-3, 4, 1)\nVector B = (0,2,1) - (2,1,3) = (-2, 1, -2)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cross product of the two vectors\nNormal vector N = A x B = (-3, 4, 1) x (-2, 1, -2)\n\nN_x = (4 * -2) - (1 * 1) = -8 - 1 = -9\nN_y = (1 * -2) - (-3 * -2) = -2 - 6 = -8\nN_z = (-3 * 1) - (4 * -2) = -3 + 8 = 5\n\nSo, the normal vector N = (-9, -8, 5)\n\nStep 3: Use the normal vector and any of the given points to find the equation of the plane\nThe general equation of a plane is given by:\nA(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0\n\nUsing the normal vector N = (-9, -8, 5) and the point (2,1,3), we have:\n-9(x - 2) - 8(y - 1) + 5(z - 3) = 0\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n-9x + 18 - 8y + 8 + 5z - 15 = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n-9x - 8y + 5z + 11 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the plane passing through the points (2,1,3), (-1,5,4), and (0,2,1) is:\n-9x - 8y + 5z + 11 = 0"
