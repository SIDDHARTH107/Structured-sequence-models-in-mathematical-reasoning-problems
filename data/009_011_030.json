    "message_1": "A small town has a population of 5,000 people. A new disease has been reported and the initial number of infected people is 150. The number of infected people increases by 20% every day. Find the number of infected people after 10 days.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of infected people after 10 days, we can use the formula for exponential growth:\n\nFinal number of infected people = Initial number of infected people * (1 + growth rate) ^ number of days\n\nIn this case, the initial number of infected people is 150, the growth rate is 20% (0.20), and the number of days is 10.\n\nFinal number of infected people = 150 * (1 + 0.20) ^ 10\n\nFinal number of infected people = 150 * (1.20) ^ 10\n\nFinal number of infected people = 150 * 6.191736422399997\n\nFinal number of infected people ≈ 928.76\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nFinal number of infected people ≈ 929\n\nAfter 10 days, there will be approximately 929 infected people in the small town."
