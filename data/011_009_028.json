    "message_2": "The Bell number B_n counts the number of ways to partition a set of n unique items into any number of non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to find B_10.\n\nThe Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle, which is constructed as follows:\n\n1. The first row starts with B_0 = 1.\n2. For each subsequent row, the first entry is the last entry of the previous row.\n3. Each entry in the row is the sum of the entry above it and the entry to the left of the entry above it.\n\nThe first few rows of the Bell triangle look like this:\n\n1\n1  2\n2  3  5\n5  7 10 15\n...\n\nWe can continue this process until we reach the 11th row (since we start with B_0):\n\n1\n1  2\n2  3  5\n5  7 10 15\n15 20 27 37 52\n52 67 87 114 163\n163 210 257 322 451\n451 562 694 877 1222\n1222 1483 1799 2296 3129\n3129 3810 4637 6057 8170\n8170 9977 12124 15731 20877\n\nThe Bell number B_10 is the first entry in the 11th row, which is 8,170. So there are 8,170 ways to arrange 10 unique items into groups where each group can contain any number of items from 0 to 10."
