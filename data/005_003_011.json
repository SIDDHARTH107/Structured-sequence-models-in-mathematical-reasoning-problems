    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line for predicting salary based on years of experience, we will use the least squares method. The equation of the regression line is given by:\n\ny = a + bx\n\nwhere y is the predicted salary, x is the years of experience, a is the y-intercept, and b is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean of the years of experience (x) and the mean of the salaries (y). \n\nMean of years of experience (x̄):\n(2 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 10 + 8) / 6 = 35 / 6 ≈ 5.83\n\nMean of salaries (ȳ):\n(25 + 40 + 45 + 30 + 60 + 55) / 6 = 255 / 6 ≈ 42.5\n\nNext, we need to calculate the slope (b) of the regression line using the formula:\n\nb = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / Σ(x - x̄)^2\n\nFor each data point, we will calculate (x - x̄)(y - ȳ) and (x - x̄)^2:\n\nData point 1: (2 - 5.83)(25 - 42.5) = -3.83 * -17.5 ≈ 67.08, (-3.83)^2 ≈ 14.67\nData point 2: (5 - 5.83)(40 - 42.5) = -0.83 * -2.5 ≈ 2.08, (-0.83)^2 ≈ 0.69\nData point 3: (7 - 5.83)(45 - 42.5) = 1.17 * 2.5 ≈ 2.92, (1.17)^2 ≈ 1.37\nData point 4: (3 - 5.83)(30 - 42.5) = -2.83 * -12.5 ≈ 35.38, (-2.83)^2 ≈ 8.01\nData point 5: (10 - 5.83)(60 - 42.5) = 4.17 * 17.5 ≈ 72.92, (4.17)^2 ≈ 17.39\nData point 6: (8 - 5.83)(55 - 42.5) = 2.17 * 12.5 ≈ 27.08, (2.17)^2 ≈ 4.71\n\nNow, we will sum up the values:\n\nΣ(x - x̄)(y - ȳ) = 67.08 + 2.08 + 2.92 + 35.38 + 72.92 + 27.08 ≈ 207.46\nΣ(x - x̄)^2 = 14.67 + 0.69 + 1.37 + 8.01 + 17.39 + 4.71 ≈ 46.84\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (b):\n\nb = 207.46 / 46.84 ≈ 4.43\n\nFinally, we will calculate the y-intercept (a) using the formula:\n\na = ȳ - b * x̄\na = 42.5 - 4.43 * 5.83 ≈ 16.92\n\nNow we have the equation of the regression line:\n\ny = 16.92 + 4.43x\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line for predicting salary based on years of experience is:\n\nSalary = 16.92 + 4.43 * Years of Experience"
