    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 on the interval [-2, 5], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + 9(-2) + 2 = -8 - 24 - 18 + 2 = -48\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 6(5)^2 + 9(5) + 2 = 125 - 150 + 45 + 2 = 22\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the maximum value is 22 at x = 5 and the minimum value is -48 at x = -2."
