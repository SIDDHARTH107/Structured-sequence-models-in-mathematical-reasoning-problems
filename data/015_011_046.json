    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the equations of motion for a double pendulum system. The equations of motion for a double pendulum are quite complex and involve solving a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations. \n\nLet's denote the angles of the two pendulum arms with respect to the vertical axis as θ1 and θ2, and their angular velocities as ω1 and ω2. The lengths of the two arms are L1 and L2, which are both 1 meter in this case. The initial angle between the arms is 45 degrees, which means θ1(0) - θ2(0) = 45°. The starting momentum is 0, so ω1(0) = ω2(0) = 0.\n\nThe equations of motion for a double pendulum can be derived using the Lagrangian method, which involves the kinetic and potential energies of the system. The equations are as follows:\n\n(1) (m1 + m2) * L1^2 * ω1' + m2 * L1 * L2 * ω2' * cos(θ1 - θ2) = -m2 * L1 * L2 * ω1 * ω2 * sin(θ1 - θ2) - (m1 + m2) * g * L1 * sin(θ1)\n\n(2) m2 * L2^2 * ω2' + m2 * L1 * L2 * ω1' * cos(θ1 - θ2) = m2 * L1 * L2 * ω1 * ω2 * sin(θ1 - θ2) - m2 * g * L2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the pendulum bobs, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and ω1' and ω2' are the angular accelerations of the two arms.\n\nTo find the angle between the two arms at 2 seconds, we need to solve these equations numerically using a suitable method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, and then compute θ1(t) - θ2(t) at t = 2 seconds. This is a task that requires a numerical solver, such as a computer program or a calculator with the capability to solve differential equations.\n\nIt's important to note that the solution will depend on the masses of the pendulum bobs (m1 and m2), which were not provided in the problem statement."
