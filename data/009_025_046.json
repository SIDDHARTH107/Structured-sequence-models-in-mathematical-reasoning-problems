Assume that α=2, θ=0.1, β=0.3, and the risk-free rate, r=0.01.",
    "message_2": "The given problem involves a stochastic volatility model, which cannot be solved directly using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula. Instead, we can use a numerical method, such as the Monte Carlo simulation, to estimate the price of the European call option.\n\nHere are the steps to perform a Monte Carlo simulation for this problem:\n\n1. Simulate the correlated Brownian motions dW_t and dZ_t using the Cholesky decomposition method or the Euler-Maruyama method. The correlation between dW_t and dZ_t needs to be determined.\n\n2. Use the simulated dW_t and dZ_t to generate paths for the stock price S_t and the volatility σ(t) using the given stochastic differential equations.\n\n3. For each path, calculate the payoff of the European call option at maturity, which is max(S_T - K, 0), where S_T is the stock price at time T and K is the strike price.\n\n4. Discount the payoffs back to the present time using the risk-free rate, r.\n\n5. Calculate the average of the discounted payoffs to estimate the price of the European call option.\n\nNote that the accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation depends on the number of paths and time steps used. More paths and time steps will generally lead to a more accurate estimate, but will also increase the computational time."
