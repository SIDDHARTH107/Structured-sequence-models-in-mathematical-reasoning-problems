    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 7x + 2, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nSo, for f(x) = 3x^2 - 7x + 2, we will differentiate each term separately:\n\nThe derivative of 3x^2 with respect to x:\n(2)(3)x^(2-1) = 6x\n\nThe derivative of -7x with respect to x:\n(-1)(7)x^(1-1) = -7\n\nThe derivative of 2 (a constant) with respect to x is 0, as constants do not change with respect to the variable.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 7\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 6(4) - 7 = 24 - 7 = 17\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 7x + 2 at x = 4 is 17."
