    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent value of the Chua circuit system, we first need to derive the equations that describe the system. The Chua circuit can be modeled by a set of three first-order differential equations:\n\n1. dV<sub>1</sub>/dt = (1/C<sub>1</sub>) * (G<sub>0</sub>(V<sub>2</sub> - V<sub>1</sub>) - I<sub>Chua</sub>(V<sub>1</sub>))\n2. dV<sub>2</sub>/dt = (1/C<sub>2</sub>) * (G<sub>0</sub>(V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>2</sub>) + I<sub>L</sub>)\n3. dI<sub>L</sub>/dt = -(1/L) * V<sub>2</sub>\n\nwhere G<sub>0</sub> = 1/R<sub>1</sub> = 1/220 Ω, I<sub>Chua</sub>(V<sub>1</sub>) is the current through the Chua diode, and I<sub>L</sub> is the current through the inductor L.\n\nThe Chua diode current can be described by the piecewise-linear function:\n\nI<sub>Chua</sub>(V<sub>1</sub>) = m<sub>1</sub> * V<sub>1</sub> + (m<sub>0</sub> - m<sub>1</sub>) * |V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>p</sub>| - (m<sub>0</sub> - m<sub>1</sub>) * |V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>p</sub>|\n\nwhere m<sub>0</sub> and m<sub>1</sub> are the slopes of the Chua diode's characteristic curve, and V<sub>p</sub> is the breakpoint voltage. In this case, m = -1.226 is the nonlinearity parameter, which is equal to m<sub>1</sub>/m<sub>0</sub>. To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to numerically integrate the system of differential equations and compute the Lyapunov exponents.\n\nThere are several numerical methods to compute the Lyapunov exponents, such as the Wolf algorithm, Rosenstein algorithm, or Kantz algorithm. The maximum Lyapunov exponent is the largest exponent among the computed values.\n\nSince the computation of the maximum Lyapunov exponent requires numerical integration and the application of specific algorithms, it is best to use software tools like MATLAB or Python to perform these calculations."
