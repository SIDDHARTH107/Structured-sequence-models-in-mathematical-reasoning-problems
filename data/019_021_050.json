    "message_1": "In a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, each player chooses one of the three options. If both players choose the same option, the game is a tie; otherwise, rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. A group of three Math students played a best-of-five game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. If the first student won three rounds, the second won two rounds, and the third didn't win any rounds, who won the game?",
    "message_2": "The first student won the game, as they won three rounds out of the best-of-five game."
