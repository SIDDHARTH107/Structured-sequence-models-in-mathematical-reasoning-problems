    "message_2": "There are five distinct isomorphism classes for a group of order 8. They are:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 8: C_8 or Z_8\nThis group has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} with addition modulo 8 as the operation. It is generated by a single element, for example, 1, and has the property that every non-identity element has an order that divides 8.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 4: C_2 × C_4 or Z_2 × Z_4\nThis group has elements {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)} with component-wise addition modulo 2 and 4 as the operation. It is generated by two elements, for example, (1,0) and (0,1).\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2: C_2 × C_2 × C_2 or Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\nThis group has elements {(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1)} with component-wise addition modulo 2 as the operation. It is generated by three elements, for example, (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).\n\n4. Quaternion group: Q_8\nThis group has elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} with quaternion multiplication as the operation. It is a non-abelian group, meaning that the order of multiplication matters. It is generated by two elements, for example, i and j.\n\n5. Dihedral group of order 8: D_4\nThis group represents the symmetries of a square and has elements {r^0, r^1, r^2, r^3, sr^0, sr^1, sr^2, sr^3}, where r represents a rotation and s represents a reflection. The operation is the composition of symmetries. It is a non-abelian group and is generated by two elements, for example, r and s.\n\nThese five groups exhaust all possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 8."
