    "message_2": "To compute the second and third Chern classes of a complex manifold $M$, we need more information about the manifold. The first Chern class $c_1(M)$ alone is not sufficient to determine $c_2(M)$ and $c_3(M)$. \n\nThe Chern classes are characteristic classes of complex vector bundles, and they are used to study the topology of complex manifolds. In general, the $k$-th Chern class $c_k(M)$ of a complex manifold $M$ is an element of the cohomology group $H^{2k}(M, \\mathbb{Z})$. The Chern classes are related to the curvature of the manifold and can be used to compute topological invariants like the Euler characteristic and the signature of the manifold.\n\nHowever, without more information about the manifold $M$, such as its dimension, its holomorphic tangent bundle, or other topological properties, we cannot determine the values of $c_2(M)$ and $c_3(M)$."
