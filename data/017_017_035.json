    "message_2": "We are given that G is a group of order 30. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup P and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q, with orders 5 and 3, respectively. Let p be an element of order 5 in P, and let q be an element of order 3 in Q.\n\nNow, consider the element g = pq. We will show that g is either of order 15 or of order 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the order of g. Since the orders of p and q are relatively prime (gcd(5, 3) = 1), we have:\n\ng^15 = (pq)^15 = p^15q^15 = (p^5)^3(p^3)^5 = e^3e^5 = e,\n\nwhere e is the identity element in G. Thus, the order of g divides 15.\n\nNow, let's check if the order of g is less than 15. If the order of g is 1, then g = e, which implies that pq = e, and hence p = q^(-1). But this would mean that p is also an element of Q, which is a contradiction since the orders of P and Q are different. Therefore, the order of g is not 1.\n\nIf the order of g is 3, then g^3 = e, which implies that p^3q^3 = e. Multiplying both sides by q^(-3) gives p^3 = q^(-3), which means that p is an element of Q, again a contradiction. Similarly, if the order of g is 5, we would find that q is an element of P, which is also a contradiction.\n\nThus, the only remaining possibilities for the order of g are 2 and 15. So, there exists an element g in G such that g is of order 15 or g is of order 2."
