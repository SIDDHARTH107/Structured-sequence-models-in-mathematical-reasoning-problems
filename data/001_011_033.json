    "message_2": "To solve the equation (4/x) + (5/(x+1)) = (9/2), we will first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator will be x(x+1).\n\nNow, we will rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(4/x) * ((x+1)/(x+1)) + (5/(x+1)) * (x/x) = (9/2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(4(x+1) + 5x) / (x(x+1)) = (9/2)\n\nNow, we will multiply both sides of the equation by 2x(x+1) to eliminate the denominators:\n\n2(4(x+1) + 5x) = 9x(x+1)\n\nDistribute and simplify:\n\n2(4x + 4 + 5x) = 9x^2 + 9x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n18x + 8 = 9x^2 + 9x\n\nNow, move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\n0 = 9x^2 + 9x - 18x - 8\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = 9x^2 - 9x - 8\n\nNow, we will attempt to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n0 = (3x - 4)(3x + 2)\n\nNow, we will set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x - 4 = 0\n3x = 4\nx = 4/3\n\nand\n\n3x + 2 = 0\n3x = -2\nx = -2/3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 4/3 and -2/3."
