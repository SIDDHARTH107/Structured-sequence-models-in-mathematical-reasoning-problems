Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of Solving partial differential equations using finite element methods:\n\nConsider the following partial differential equation:\n\n(∂²u/∂x²) + (∂²u/∂y²) = 3x + 4y + 5\n\nwith boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,y) = y², u(1,y) = 1 + y², u(x,0) = x², u(x,1) = 1 + x²\n\nUsing the finite element method and a square 2D mesh with 16 nodes (4 nodes per element), approximate the solution to this partial differential equation over the domain [0,1] × [0,1].",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain: Since we are using a square 2D mesh with 16 nodes (4 nodes per element), we will divide the domain [0,1] × [0,1] into a 3x3 grid of square elements, each with side length 1/3.\n\n2. Define the basis functions: We will use bilinear basis functions for each element, which are defined as:\n\nN1(x, y) = (1-x)(1-y)/9\nN2(x, y) = x(1-y)/9\nN3(x, y) = xy/9\nN4(x, y) = (1-x)y/9\n\n3. Formulate the weak form of the PDE: Multiply the PDE by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain. Then, apply integration by parts to simplify the resulting expression.\n\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and force vector: For each element, compute the local stiffness matrix and force vector using the basis functions and their derivatives. Then, assemble these local matrices and vectors into a global stiffness matrix and force vector.\n\n5. Apply boundary conditions: Modify the global stiffness matrix and force vector to account for the given boundary conditions.\n\n6. Solve the linear system: Solve the linear system Ku = F for the unknown nodal values u, where K is the global stiffness matrix and F is the global force vector.\n\n7. Compute the approximate solution: Using the nodal values obtained in step 6, compute the approximate solution to the PDE as a linear combination of the basis functions.\n\nDue to the complexity of the calculations involved in steps 4-7, it is common to use specialized software or programming languages (such as MATLAB or Python) to perform these steps. The final approximate solution will be a continuous piecewise function defined over the domain [0,1] × [0,1]."
