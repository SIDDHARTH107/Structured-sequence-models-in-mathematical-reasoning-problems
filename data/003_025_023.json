    "message_2": "To find the resulting velocity of the plane, we need to consider both the plane's velocity and the headwind's velocity as vectors. Let's represent the plane's velocity vector as Vp and the headwind's velocity vector as Vw.\n\nVp = 500 km/h (due north)\nVw = 100 km/h (due west)\n\nSince the plane is flying due north, its velocity vector can be represented as:\n\nVp = (0, 500)\n\nThe headwind is blowing from the west, so its velocity vector can be represented as:\n\nVw = (-100, 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of these two vectors to get the resulting velocity vector (Vr):\n\nVr = Vp + Vw\nVr = (0, 500) + (-100, 0)\nVr = (-100, 500)\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude and direction of the resulting velocity vector Vr.\n\nMagnitude of Vr = √((-100)^2 + (500)^2)\nMagnitude of Vr = √(10000 + 250000)\nMagnitude of Vr = √260000\nMagnitude of Vr ≈ 509.9 km/h\n\nNow, let's find the direction of the resulting velocity vector Vr. We can use the arctangent function to find the angle θ between the resulting velocity vector and the intended path (due north).\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = (-100) / (500)\n\nθ = arctan((-100) / (500))\nθ ≈ -11.3°\n\nSince the angle is negative, it means that the resulting velocity vector is 11.3° west of the intended path (due north).\n\nSo, the resulting velocity of the plane is approximately 509.9 km/h, and its direction is 11.3° west of its intended path (due north)."
