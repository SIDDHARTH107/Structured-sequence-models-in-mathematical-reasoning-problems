    "message_2": "Given that f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z=0, we can write the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z=0 as:\n\nf(z) = a_(-2)/z^2 + a_(-1)/z + a_0 + a_1*z + a_2*z^2 + ...\n\nwhere a_n are the coefficients of the Laurent series.\n\nNow, we know that f(z) has a removable singularity at z=1. This means that the limit as z approaches 1 exists and is finite. Therefore, we can write:\n\nlim (z->1) f(z) = L, where L is a finite complex number.\n\nLet's plug z=1 into the Laurent series expansion:\n\nL = a_(-2) + a_(-1) + a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ...\n\nSince the limit exists and is finite, we can conclude that the coefficients of the negative powers of z must be zero. Otherwise, the limit would not exist or would be infinite. Therefore, we have:\n\na_(-2) = 0 and a_(-1) = 0\n\nNow, the residue of f(z) at z=0 is the coefficient of the 1/z term in the Laurent series expansion, which is a_(-1). Since we found that a_(-1) = 0, the residue of f(z) at z=0 is:\n\nResidue = 0"
