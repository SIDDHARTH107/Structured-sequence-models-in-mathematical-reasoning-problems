    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we can use the inverse matrix method. First, we write the given system of equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  4 |\n    | 2 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 14 |\n    | -7 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -5) - (4 * 2) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A. The adjugate of A is found by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -4 |\n         | -2  3 |\n\nNow, we find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-23) * | -5 -4 |\n                  | -2  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/23  4/23 |\n         | 2/23 -3/23 |\n\nNow, we multiply A^(-1) by B to find the values of X:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/23  4/23 | * | 14 |\n    |  2/23 -3/23 |   | -7 |\n\nX = | (5/23 * 14) + (4/23 * -7) |\n    | (2/23 * 14) + (-3/23 * -7) |\n\nX = | 70/23 - 28/23 |\n    | 28/23 + 21/23 |\n\nX = | 42/23 |\n    | 49/23 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are:\n\nx = 42/23\ny = 49/23"
