    "message_1": "Suppose there are two types of sellers in a used car market - high-quality and low-quality. The probability that a seller is high-quality is 0.5. The market value of a high-quality car is $10,000 and the market value of a low-quality car is $5,000. However, a low-quality car may have a hidden defect that reduces its value by $2,000. A buyer cannot observe the type of the seller and can only observe the car's price. What's the buyer's expected utility of buying a car that costs $7,000?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the buyer's expected utility of buying a car that costs $7,000, we need to consider the probabilities of the car being high-quality or low-quality, as well as the potential hidden defect in the low-quality car.\n\n1. If the car is high-quality, the probability is 0.5, and the buyer's utility is the difference between the market value of the car and the price paid: $10,000 - $7,000 = $3,000.\n\n2. If the car is low-quality without a hidden defect, the probability is 0.5 * 0.5 (since there's a 50% chance of being low-quality and a 50% chance of not having a hidden defect). The buyer's utility is the difference between the market value of the car and the price paid: $5,000 - $7,000 = -$2,000.\n\n3. If the car is low-quality with a hidden defect, the probability is 0.5 * 0.5 (since there's a 50% chance of being low-quality and a 50% chance of having a hidden defect). The buyer's utility is the difference between the adjusted market value of the car and the price paid: ($5,000 - $2,000) - $7,000 = -$4,000.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected utility by multiplying the utilities by their respective probabilities and summing them up:\n\nExpected utility = (0.5 * $3,000) + (0.25 * -$2,000) + (0.25 * -$4,000)\nExpected utility = $1,500 - $500 - $1,000\nExpected utility = $0\n\nThe buyer's expected utility of buying a car that costs $7,000 is $0."
