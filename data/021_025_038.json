    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. However, for the given function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1, we can find the minimum value using basic calculus, as it is a simple quadratic function.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function, we can complete the square or find the vertex of the parabola:\n\nf(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1\n     = (x^2 + 2x + 1) + 1 - 1\n     = (x + 1)^2\n\nSince the square of any real number is non-negative, the minimum value of the function is 0, which occurs when x = -1.\n\nAlthough the Whale Optimization Algorithm can be used to solve complex optimization problems, it is not necessary for this simple quadratic function. The minimum value of f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 is 0, and it occurs at x = -1."
