    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the given trigonometric function y = 5cos(3x), we need to identify the values of A and B in the general form of the cosine function: y = A*cos(Bx).\n\nIn this case, A = 5 and B = 3.\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of A, which is:\n\nAmplitude = |A| = |5| = 5\n\nThe period of the function is the ratio of 2π to B, which is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / B = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function y = 5cos(3x) is 5, and the period is (2π) / 3."
