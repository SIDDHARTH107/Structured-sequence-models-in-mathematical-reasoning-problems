    "message_2": "To find the private key `d` in RSA encryption, we need to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `e` modulo `φ(n)`. In this case, we have `e = 7` and `φ(n) = 168`. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse.\n\nThe equation we want to solve is:\n\n`e * d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n`7 * d ≡ 1 (mod 168)`\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we can find the value of `d`:\n\n1. Initialize: `r0 = 168, r1 = 7, t0 = 0, t1 = 1`\n2. Divide: `168 = 7 * 24 + 0`, so `quotient = 24`\n3. Update: `r2 = r0 - quotient * r1 = 168 - 24 * 7 = 0`, `t2 = t0 - quotient * t1 = 0 - 24 * 1 = -24`\n4. Since `r2 = 0`, we stop here. The previous remainder `r1 = 7` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `168` and `7`, and the corresponding `t1 = 1` is the modular inverse of `7` modulo `168`.\n\nHowever, the value of `t1` is negative, so we need to convert it to a positive value by adding `φ(n)`:\n\n`d = t1 + φ(n) = -24 + 168 = 144`\n\nSo, the private key `d` is `144`."
