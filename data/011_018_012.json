    "message_1": "A group of 12 students is taking a math class. The teacher wants to divide them into three discussion groups of 4 students each for a project. How many different ways can the teacher do this?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students and k is the number of students in each group.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to choose the first group of 4 students from the 12 students. This can be done using the combination formula:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!) = 12! / (4!8!) = 495 ways.\n\nNow, we have 8 students left to choose the second group of 4 students. Using the combination formula again:\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!) = 8! / (4!4!) = 70 ways.\n\nFinally, we have 4 students left for the last group, and there's only 1 way to choose all of them.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to divide the 12 students into three groups of 4, we multiply the number of ways for each group. However, since the groups are indistinguishable, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 groups, which is 3! (3 factorial).\n\nTotal ways = (495 * 70 * 1) / 3! = (495 * 70) / 6 = 5775 ways.\n\nSo, the teacher can divide the 12 students into three discussion groups of 4 students each in 5775 different ways."
