    "message_2": "We will use the Schwarz lemma to solve this problem. First, we need to normalize the function f(z) such that it maps the unit disk D onto itself and f(0) = 0. To do this, we define a new function g(z) as follows:\n\ng(z) = f(z) - 2\n\nNow, g(z) is analytic in the unit disk D, and g(1/2) = 0. Moreover, the real part of g(z) is non-negative on the boundary ∂D.\n\nNext, we apply a Möbius transformation to map the unit disk D onto itself and ensure that g(i) is mapped to the origin. Define a new function h(z) as follows:\n\nh(z) = \\(\\frac{g(z) - g(i)}{1 - \\overline{g(i)}g(z)}\\)\n\nh(z) is analytic in the unit disk D, and h(i) = 0. Moreover, the real part of h(z) is non-negative on the boundary ∂D.\n\nNow, we can apply the Schwarz lemma to h(z). By the Schwarz lemma, we have:\n\n|h(z)| ≤ |z| for all z in D\n\nIn particular, we have:\n\n|h(i)| ≤ |i|\n\nSince h(i) = 0, this inequality holds. Now, we will reverse the transformations to find the value of f(i). From the definition of h(z), we have:\n\ng(z) = \\(\\frac{g(i) + h(z)}{1 - \\overline{g(i)}h(z)}\\)\n\nPlugging in z = i, we get:\n\ng(i) = \\(\\frac{g(i) + 0}{1 - \\overline{g(i)}0}\\)\n\ng(i) = g(i)\n\nFinally, we reverse the normalization transformation:\n\nf(z) = g(z) + 2\n\nf(i) = g(i) + 2\n\nThus, the value of f(i) is g(i) + 2."
