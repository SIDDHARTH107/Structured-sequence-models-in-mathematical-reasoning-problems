    "message_1": "An investor hires a manager to oversee a project that has a potential payout of $100,000. The investor can choose to either monitor the project closely or trust the manager to make decisions independently. If the investor monitors the project, the manager will receive a salary of $20,000. If the investor trusts the manager, the manager will receive a salary of $40,000. If the manager makes good decisions, the project will produce a payout of $90,000. If the manager makes poor decisions, the project will produce a payout of $60,000. Assuming the manager's objective is to maximize their own salary, what decision should the investor make?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Investor monitors the project\nManager's salary: $20,000\nPotential project payouts: $90,000 (good decisions) or $60,000 (poor decisions)\n\nScenario 2: Investor trusts the manager\nManager's salary: $40,000\nPotential project payouts: $90,000 (good decisions) or $60,000 (poor decisions)\n\nSince the manager's objective is to maximize their own salary, they would prefer Scenario 2, where they receive a salary of $40,000. However, the investor's decision should be based on the potential project payouts and the manager's salary.\n\nIf the investor chooses to monitor the project (Scenario 1), the total cost would be $20,000 (manager's salary) and the potential payouts would be $90,000 or $60,000. The net gains for the investor would be $70,000 (good decisions) or $40,000 (poor decisions).\n\nIf the investor chooses to trust the manager (Scenario 2), the total cost would be $40,000 (manager's salary) and the potential payouts would be $90,000 or $60,000. The net gains for the investor would be $50,000 (good decisions) or $20,000 (poor decisions).\n\nWithout knowing the probability of the manager making good or poor decisions, it's difficult to determine the expected value for each scenario. However, the investor should consider that by monitoring the project, they can potentially have more control over the decision-making process and reduce the risk of poor decisions. \n\nBased on the information provided, the investor should choose to monitor the project (Scenario 1) to minimize the manager's salary cost and potentially have more control over the project's outcome."
