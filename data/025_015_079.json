    "message_2": "To find the intersection of the surface with the plane y = 2, we substitute y = 2 into the equation of the surface:\n\nx^2(2)z + 3(2^2)z + z^3 - x^2 - (2)^2 - z^2 - 1 = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2x^2z + 12z + z^3 - x^2 - 4 - z^2 - 1 = 0\n\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n\nz^3 - z^2 + 2x^2z + 12z - x^2 - 5 = 0\n\nNow, we need to check if the intersection is a smooth curve or if there are any singular points. To do this, we compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂f/∂x = 4xz - 2x\n∂f/∂y = 0 (since y is constant and equal to 2)\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2 - 2z + 2x^2 + 12\n\nTo find singular points, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n4xz - 2x = 0\n3z^2 - 2z + 2x^2 + 12 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) x = 0, then the second equation becomes:\n3z^2 - 2z + 12 = 0\nThis equation has no real solutions for z, so there are no singular points in this case.\n\n2) 4z - 2 = 0, then z = 1/2. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n3(1/2)^2 - 2(1/2) + 2x^2 + 12 = 0\n3/4 - 1 + 2x^2 + 12 = 0\n2x^2 = -35/4\nThis equation has no real solutions for x, so there are no singular points in this case either.\n\nSince there are no singular points, the intersection of the surface with the plane y = 2 is a smooth curve."
