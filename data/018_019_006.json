The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {3, 6, 9}\n\nIntersection of A and B (A ∩ B) = {6}\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9} - {6} = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and {6, 9, 12, 15}.\n\n(A △ B) = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\nC = {6, 9, 12, 15}\n\nIntersection of (A △ B) and C ((A △ B) ∩ C) = {9}\n(A △ B) △ C = ((A △ B) ∪ C) - ((A △ B) ∩ C) = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15} - {9} = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 15}\n\nSo, (A △ B) △ {6, 9, 12, 15} = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 15}."
