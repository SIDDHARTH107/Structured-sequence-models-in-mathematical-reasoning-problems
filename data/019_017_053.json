We need to find a natural number $y$ that satisfies the equation $y = x \\times x + 1$. \n\nConsider the expression $x \\times x + 1$. Since $x$ is a natural number, $x \\times x$ is also a natural number (by closure of multiplication in natural numbers). Furthermore, since $1$ is a natural number, the sum $x \\times x + 1$ is also a natural number (by closure of addition in natural numbers).\n\nLet $y = x \\times x + 1$. By construction, $y$ is a natural number, and it satisfies the equation $y = x \\times x + 1$. \n\nSince $x$ was an arbitrary natural number, we have shown that for every natural number $x$, there exists a natural number $y$ such that $y = x \\times x + 1$. Therefore, the given sentence is true over the standard model $(\\mathbb{N}, 0, 1, +, \\times, <)$."
