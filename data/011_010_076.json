    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number can be defined as C_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). In this case, we have 7 people and 8 seats, so we need to find the 6th Catalan number (since there are 6 spaces between the 7 people).\n\nC_6 = (1/(6+1)) * (2*6 choose 6) = (1/7) * (12 choose 6)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the binomial coefficient (12 choose 6):\n\n(12 choose 6) = 12! / (6! * (12-6)!) = 924\n\nNow, we can find the 6th Catalan number:\n\nC_6 = (1/7) * 924 = 132\n\nSo, there are 132 ways for the 7 people to be seated in a row of 8 seats such that no two people sit next to each other."
