    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph completely, we need to ensure that there is no path between any pair of vertices. To achieve this, we can remove edges in such a way that the graph is broken down into isolated vertices.\n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles and has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In our case, we have 10 vertices, so the minimum number of edges required to keep the graph connected is 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\nSince the graph currently has 15 edges, we need to remove at least 15 - 9 = 6 edges to disconnect the graph completely."
