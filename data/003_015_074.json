    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 5sin(2x + π/4), we need to analyze the coefficients of the sine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is |5| = 5.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the graph is 5, and the period is π."
