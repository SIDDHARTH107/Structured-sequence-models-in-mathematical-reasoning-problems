    "message_1": "Consider a circuit that contains a 500 ohm resistor, a 2mH inductor, and a 10μF capacitor in series. The circuit is connected to a 100V 60Hz AC source. Find the differential equation that describes the current, i(t), through the circuit, and solve for the steady-state solution of i(t) when t → ∞.",
    "message_2": "To find the differential equation that describes the current i(t) through the circuit, we can use Kirchhoff's voltage law, which states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop is equal to zero. In this case, the voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law (V_R = iR), the voltage across the inductor is given by V_L = L(di/dt), and the voltage across the capacitor is given by V_C = 1/C ∫i(t)dt. The AC source voltage is given by V(t) = V_0 * sin(ωt), where V_0 = 100V and ω = 2π * 60Hz.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's voltage law, we have:\n\nV(t) - V_R - V_L - V_C = 0\n\nV_0 * sin(ωt) - iR - L(di/dt) - 1/C ∫i(t)dt = 0\n\nDifferentiating the equation with respect to time, we get:\n\nV_0 * ω * cos(ωt) - R(di/dt) - L(d^2i/dt^2) - 1/C * i(t) = 0\n\nNow, we have a second-order linear differential equation:\n\nL(d^2i/dt^2) + R(di/dt) + 1/C * i(t) = V_0 * ω * cos(ωt)\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n(2 * 10^(-3))(d^2i/dt^2) + 500(di/dt) + 1/(10 * 10^(-6)) * i(t) = 100 * 2π * 60 * cos(2π * 60t)\n\nNow, to find the steady-state solution of i(t) when t → ∞, we can assume that the transient response has decayed and the current has reached a sinusoidal steady-state. In this case, the current can be represented as:\n\ni(t) = I * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere I is the amplitude of the current and φ is the phase angle.\n\nThe impedance of the circuit is given by:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (ωL - 1/(ωC))^2)\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nZ = √(500^2 + (2π * 60 * 2 * 10^(-3) - 1/(2π * 60 * 10 * 10^(-6)))^2) ≈ 503.98 ohms\n\nThe amplitude of the current is given by:\n\nI = V_0 / Z = 100V / 503.98 ohms ≈ 0.1984 A\n\nThe phase angle φ can be found using the following equation:\n\ntan(φ) = (ωL - 1/(ωC)) / R\n\nφ = arctan((2π * 60 * 2 * 10^(-3) - 1/(2π * 60 * 10 * 10^(-6))) / 500) ≈ -0.3984 radians\n\nNow, we have the steady-state solution for i(t) when t → ∞:\n\ni(t) = 0.1984 * cos(2π * 60t - 0.3984) A"
