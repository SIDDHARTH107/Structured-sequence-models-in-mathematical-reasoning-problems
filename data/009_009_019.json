    "message_2": "To solve Schrödinger's time-independent equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box, we first need to set up the equation. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\nHψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian operator, ψ(x) is the wave function of the particle, and E is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nFor a particle in a one-dimensional box, the Hamiltonian operator is given by:\n\nH = -ħ² / (2m) * (d²/dx²) + V(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, and V(x) is the potential energy function. In this case, the potential energy is 0 inside the box (0 < x < L) and 20 eV at the boundaries (x = 0 and x = L). Therefore, V(x) can be written as:\n\nV(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L\nV(x) = 20 eV for x = 0 and x = L\n\nNow, we need to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation inside the box (0 < x < L):\n\n-ħ² / (2m) * (d²ψ(x)/dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nLet's convert the given values to SI units:\n\nMass, m = 2 kg\nLength, L = 10 nm = 10 * 10^(-9) m\nPotential energy at boundaries, V(x) = 20 eV = 20 * 1.6 * 10^(-19) J\nReduced Planck constant, ħ = 1.054 * 10^(-34) Js\n\nNow, we can solve the differential equation:\n\n(d²ψ(x)/dx²) = -2mE/ħ² * ψ(x)\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE/ħ²).\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n1) ψ(0) = 0:\n0 = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0)\n0 = B\n\nSo, B = 0 and the wave function becomes:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\n2) ψ(L) = 0:\n0 = A * sin(kL)\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivial), we must have:\n\nsin(kL) = 0\n\nThis implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, k = nπ/L.\n\nNow, we can find the energy eigenvalues:\n\nE = ħ²k² / (2m)\nE = ħ²(nπ/L)² / (2m)\n\nSo, the energy eigenvalues are quantized and depend on the quantum number n:\n\nE_n = ħ²(nπ/L)² / (2m)\n\nThe wave function for the particle in the one-dimensional box is given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = A_n * sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere A_n is a normalization constant, which can be found by imposing the normalization condition:\n\n∫ |ψ_n(x)|² dx = 1\n\nAfter normalization, the wave function becomes:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nThese are the solutions to Schrödinger's time-independent equation for a particle of mass 2 kg in a one-dimensional box of length 10 nm with a potential energy of 20 eV at the boundaries."
