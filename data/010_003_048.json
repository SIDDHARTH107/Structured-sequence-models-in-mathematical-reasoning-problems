    "message_2": "In a topological space, two points are separated if there exist disjoint open sets containing each of the points. In this case, we want to separate points b and c.\n\nFrom the given topology τ, we can see that the open set {b} contains point b and the open set {c} contains point c. These two open sets are disjoint, as they have no elements in common.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of open sets that can separate points b and c is 2, namely {b} and {c}."
