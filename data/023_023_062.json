    "message_2": "(a) The given signal can be written as:\n\n$f(t) = A_0 + A_1\\cos(2\\pi f_1 t + \\phi_1) + A_2\\sin(2\\pi f_2 t + \\phi_2)$\n\nComparing this with the given signal, we can identify the amplitude, frequency, and phase angle of each term:\n\n1. Constant term: $A_0 = 3$\n2. First term: $A_1 = 5$, $f_1 = 10$ Hz, and $\\phi_1 = 0$ (since it's a cosine term)\n3. Second term: $A_2 = 2$, $f_2 = 20$ Hz, and $\\phi_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (since it's a sine term)\n\nSo, the amplitude, frequency, and phase angle for each term are:\n\n1. Constant term: Amplitude = 3\n2. First term: Amplitude = 5, Frequency = 10 Hz, Phase angle = 0\n3. Second term: Amplitude = 2, Frequency = 20 Hz, Phase angle = $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n\n(b) To find the frequencies present in the signal, we can use the Fourier transform. However, since the given signal is already in the frequency domain, we can directly identify the frequencies present in the signal:\n\n1. The constant term ($A_0 = 3$) represents the DC component (0 Hz) of the signal.\n2. The first term has a frequency of $f_1 = 10$ Hz.\n3. The second term has a frequency of $f_2 = 20$ Hz.\n\nTherefore, the frequencies present in the signal are 0 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz."
