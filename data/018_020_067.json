    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and {(A ∪ B) ∆ A}. Show that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∪ B) and A, denoted as (A ∪ B) ∆ A.\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ A = ((A ∪ B) - A) ∪ (A - (A ∪ B))\n\n(A ∪ B) - A = {5, 6}\nA - (A ∪ B) = {}\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ A = {5, 6}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and ((A ∪ B) ∆ A).\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ ((A ∪ B) ∆ A) = (A ∆ B) ∆ ({5, 6})\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ ({5, 6}) = ({1, 2, 5, 6} - {5, 6}) ∪ ({5, 6} - {1, 2, 5, 6})\n= {1, 2} ∪ {}\n= {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union. We want to show that for any sets A, B, and C:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C) = (A ∪ B) ∆ (A ∪ C)\n\nLet's break down the left side of the equation:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C) = ((A - B) ∪ (B - A)) ∪ ((A - C) ∪ (C - A))\n\nNow, let's break down the right side of the equation:\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ (A ∪ C) = ((A ∪ B) - (A ∪ C)) ∪ ((A ∪ C) - (A ∪ B))\n= ((A - C) ∪ (B - C)) ∪ ((A - B) ∪ (C - B))\n\nBy comparing the two sides, we can see that they are equal:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C) = (A ∪ B) ∆ (A ∪ C)\n\nThus, the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union."
