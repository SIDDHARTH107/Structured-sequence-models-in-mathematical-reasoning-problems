    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nThe formulas for the coefficients are:\n\na_0 = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x) cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x) sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function, all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\na_0 = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] x dx = 0 (due to the odd function property)\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] x sin(nx) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) cos(nx)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) [(-x/n) cos(nx) - ∫ (-1/n) cos(nx) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) [(-x/n) cos(nx) + (1/n^2) sin(nx)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) [(1/n^2) sin(nπ) - (1/n^2) sin(-nπ)] = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer n)\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = ∑ (2/π) (1/n) sin(nx) for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nNow, let's determine the convergence of the Fourier series at the point x = π/2:\n\nf(π/2) = ∑ (2/π) (1/n) sin(nπ/2) for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nNotice that sin(nπ/2) = 1 for odd n and sin(nπ/2) = 0 for even n. Therefore, the series converges to:\n\nf(π/2) = (2/π) (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...)\n\nThis is an alternating series, and it converges to f(π/2) = π/2, which is the value of the original function at x = π/2."
