To find the smallest twin prime greater than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 100 and see if either the number 2 less or 2 more than it is also prime.\n\n101 is prime, but 99 and 103 are not prime.\n103 is not prime.\n104 is not prime.\n105 is not prime.\n106 is not prime.\n107 is prime, but 105 and 109 are not prime.\n109 is not prime.\n110 is not prime.\n111 is not prime.\n112 is not prime.\n113 is prime, and 115 is not prime, but 111 is not prime.\n114 is not prime.\n115 is not prime.\n116 is not prime.\n117 is not prime.\n118 is not prime.\n119 is not prime.\n120 is not prime.\n121 is not prime.\n122 is not prime.\n123 is not prime.\n124 is not prime.\n125 is not prime.\n126 is not prime.\n127 is prime, and 129 is not prime, but 125 is not prime.\n128 is not prime.\n129 is not prime.\n130 is not prime.\n131 is prime, and 133 is not prime, but 129 is not prime.\n132 is not prime.\n133 is not prime.\n134 is not prime.\n135 is not prime.\n136 is not prime.\n137 is prime, but 135 and 139 are not prime.\n139 is not prime.\n140 is not prime.\n141 is not prime.\n142 is not prime.\n143 is not prime.\n144 is not prime.\n145 is not prime.\n146 is not prime.\n147 is not prime.\n148 is not prime.\n149 is prime, and 151 is prime.\n\nSo, the smallest twin prime greater than 100 is (149, 151)."
