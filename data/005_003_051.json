    "message_1": "Suppose a company conducted a regression analysis to predict the sales of a product based on the advertising budget. The analysis yielded the following equation: \n\nSales = 100 + 5*Advertising \n\nIf the advertising budget is $10,000, what is the predicted sales for the product?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted sales for the product, we need to plug the advertising budget into the equation:\n\nSales = 100 + 5 * Advertising\n\nGiven the advertising budget is $10,000, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nSales = 100 + 5 * 10,000\n\nNow, we can solve for Sales:\n\nSales = 100 + 50,000\n\nSales = 50,100\n\nSo, the predicted sales for the product with an advertising budget of $10,000 is $50,100."
