    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero, i.e., $\\sin z = 0$. The sine function has zeros at integer multiples of $\\pi$, i.e., $z = n\\pi$ where $n$ is an integer. Inside the unit circle $|z| = 1$, we have only one such zero, which is $z = 0$. However, since the denominator also has a zero at $z = 0$, we need to consider the limit of the function as $z \\to 0$.\n\nUsing L'HÃ´pital's rule, we can find the limit of the function as $z \\to 0$:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin z}{z^3} = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos z}{3z^2} = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{-\\sin z}{6z} = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{-\\cos z}{6} = -\\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nSince the limit exists and is not equal to zero, the function does not have a zero at $z = 0$. Therefore, there are no zeros of the function inside the unit circle.\n\nNow let's find the poles of the function. A pole occurs when the denominator is equal to zero, i.e., $z^3 = 0$. The only pole is at $z = 0$. To find the order of the pole, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the function $g(z) = z^n f(z)$ is analytic and nonzero at $z = 0$. In this case, we have:\n\n$$g(z) = z^3 \\frac{\\sin z}{z^3} = \\sin z$$\n\nSince $\\sin z$ is analytic and nonzero at $z = 0$, the order of the pole at $z = 0$ is 3.\n\nIn summary, there are no zeros of the function $f(z) = \\frac{\\sin z}{z^3}$ inside the unit circle, and there is a pole of order 3 at $z = 0$."
