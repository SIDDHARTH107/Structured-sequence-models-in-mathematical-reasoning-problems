    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given function y = 3sin(2x - pi/3), we need to analyze the function and compare it to the general form of a sine function, which is y = A*sin(B(x - C)).\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function, which determines the maximum value of the function. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. The period of the standard sine function y = sin(x) is 2π. To find the period of the given function, we need to look at the coefficient of x inside the sine function, which is B. In this case, B = 2. The period of the function y = A*sin(B(x - C)) is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nFor our function, the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function y = 3sin(2x - pi/3) is 3, and the period is π."
