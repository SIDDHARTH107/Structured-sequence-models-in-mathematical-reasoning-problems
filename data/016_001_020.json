    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, there are N = 3 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of S = 2 (each side length of the smaller triangles is half the side length of the original triangle).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Sierpinski triangle is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2) â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.5849625."
