    "message_2": "The time complexity of sorting n items using the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, and O(n) in the best case (when the list is already sorted). This is because bubble sort compares each element with its adjacent element and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It does this for n-1 passes, where n is the number of elements in the list.\n\nFor n = 10, let's calculate the number of comparisons and swaps in the worst case (when the list is sorted in reverse order):\n\nPass 1: 9 comparisons and swaps\nPass 2: 8 comparisons and swaps\nPass 3: 7 comparisons and swaps\nPass 4: 6 comparisons and swaps\nPass 5: 5 comparisons and swaps\nPass 6: 4 comparisons and swaps\nPass 7: 3 comparisons and swaps\nPass 8: 2 comparisons and swaps\nPass 9: 1 comparison and swap\n\nTotal comparisons and swaps: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45\n\nSo, for n = 10, bubble sort takes 45 comparisons and swaps in the worst case."
