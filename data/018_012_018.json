    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) ∩ C. This is the set of all elements that are both in A x B and in C. Since C contains only single elements (5, 6) and A x B contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements between A x B and C.\n\n(A x B) ∩ C = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of B and C, denoted as B ∩ C. This is the set of all elements that are both in B and in C.\n\nB ∩ C = ∅ (the empty set, since there are no common elements between B and C)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∩ C), denoted as A x (B ∩ C). Since B ∩ C is the empty set, the Cartesian product will also be the empty set.\n\nA x (B ∩ C) = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNow, let's compare (A x B) ∩ C and A x (B ∩ C):\n\n(A x B) ∩ C = ∅\nA x (B ∩ C) = ∅\n\nIn this particular case, (A x B) ∩ C and A x (B ∩ C) are equal, both being the empty set. However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product is associative with respect to intersection in general. To show that it is not associative, we need to find a counterexample.\n\nConsider the following sets:\n\nA = {1}, B = {2}, and C = {2}\n\nNow, let's find A x B, (A x B) ∩ C, B ∩ C, and A x (B ∩ C):\n\nA x B = {(1, 2)}\n\n(A x B) ∩ C = {(1, 2)} (since the ordered pair (1, 2) is in both A x B and C)\n\nB ∩ C = {2} (since 2 is the common element between B and C)\n\nA x (B ∩ C) = A x {2} = {(1, 2)}\n\nIn this case, (A x B) ∩ C and A x (B ∩ C) are not equal:\n\n(A x B) ∩ C = {(1, 2)}\nA x (B ∩ C) = ∅\n\nThis counterexample shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
