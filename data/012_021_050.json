    "message_2": "The treewidth of the given graph is 2.\n\nA possible tree decomposition for the graph is:\n\n```\n  1. {A, B, C}\n / \\\n2. {B, D, E}  3. {C, E, F}\n      |\n      4. {E, G, H}\n```\n\nIn this tree decomposition, the largest bag size is 3, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2. This is the minimum width possible for this graph, so the treewidth is 2."
