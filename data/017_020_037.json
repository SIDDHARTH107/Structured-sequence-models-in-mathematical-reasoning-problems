    "message_2": "The order of G is 40, which can be factored as $40 = 2^3 \\cdot 5$. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 8) in G. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by $n_2$, must satisfy:\n\n1. $n_2 | 5$ (divides the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup)\n2. $n_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$\n\nThe only possibility for $n_2$ is 1 or 5. If $n_2 = 1$, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. If $n_2 = 5$, then there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G.\n\nNext, let's find the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) in G. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted by $n_5$, must satisfy:\n\n1. $n_5 | 8$ (divides the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup)\n2. $n_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n\nThe possible values for $n_5$ are 1 or 8. If $n_5 = 1$, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is normal in G. If $n_5 = 8$, then there are 8 Sylow 5-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G.\n\nNow we analyze the possible structures of G based on the values of $n_2$ and $n_5$:\n\n1. If $n_2 = 1$ and $n_5 = 1$, then G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique normal Sylow 5-subgroup Q. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group C40.\n\n2. If $n_2 = 1$ and $n_5 = 8$, then G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P and a non-normal Sylow 5-subgroup Q. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, which results in the dihedral group D20.\n\n3. If $n_2 = 5$ and $n_5 = 1$, then G has a non-normal Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique normal Sylow 5-subgroup Q. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, which results in one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\n4. If $n_2 = 5$ and $n_5 = 8$, then G has non-normal Sylow 2-subgroups and non-normal Sylow 5-subgroups. However, this case is not possible because the total number of elements in all Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups would exceed the order of G.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C40, D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40."
