    "message_1": "A math student is designing a survey for a market research study. The student wants to survey 15 different households about their beverage preferences. The student wants to make sure that each household is only surveyed once, and that every possible combination of 5 households is surveyed exactly once. How many different ways can the math student choose the households to survey?",
    "message_2": "The student wants to choose 5 households out of 15 without repetition. This is a combination problem. We can use the formula for combinations, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of households (15 in this case), k is the number of households to choose (5 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15-5)!)\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!10!)\n\nC(15, 5) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nWe can cancel out some of the terms:\n\nC(15, 5) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nNow, we can compute the result:\n\nC(15, 5) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 3003\n\nSo, there are 3003 different ways the math student can choose the households to survey."
