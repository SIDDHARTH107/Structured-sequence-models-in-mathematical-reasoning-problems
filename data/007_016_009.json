    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 1000, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 1000 and see if 2p + 1 is also prime.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 1000 is 1009. Let's check if 2 * 1009 + 1 is prime:\n\n2 * 1009 + 1 = 2019\n\n2019 is divisible by 3 (3 * 673), so it's not prime. Therefore, 1009 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nThe next prime number is 1013. Let's check if 2 * 1013 + 1 is prime:\n\n2 * 1013 + 1 = 2027\n\n2027 is divisible by 7 (7 * 289), so it's not prime. Therefore, 1013 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nThe next prime number is 1019. Let's check if 2 * 1019 + 1 is prime:\n\n2 * 1019 + 1 = 2039\n\n2039 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (which is approximately 45.2), so it's prime. Therefore, 1019 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nSo, the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 1000 is 1019."
