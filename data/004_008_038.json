    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 + 3x - 4 at the point where x = 2, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 3x - 4. \n\nTo find the derivative, we apply the power rule:\n\ndy/dx = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we need to find the slope at the point where x = 2:\n\ndy/dx (2) = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 7."
