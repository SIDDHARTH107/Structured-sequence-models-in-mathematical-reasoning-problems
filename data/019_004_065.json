    "message_1": "A train starts from point A and travels towards point B at a speed of 60 km/hr. After 2 hours, a car starts from point A towards point B at a speed of 80 km/hr. How long will it take for the car to overtake the train assuming the train maintains a constant speed?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the time it takes for the car to overtake the train as t hours. In this time, the train will have traveled for (t + 2) hours, since it started 2 hours earlier than the car.\n\nThe distance covered by both the train and the car will be the same when the car overtakes the train. We can use the formula distance = speed × time to find the distance covered by both.\n\nDistance covered by train = speed of train × time taken by train\nDistance covered by train = 60 × (t + 2)\n\nDistance covered by car = speed of car × time taken by car\nDistance covered by car = 80 × t\n\nSince the distances are equal when the car overtakes the train, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n60 × (t + 2) = 80 × t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\n60t + 120 = 80t\n120 = 20t\nt = 6\n\nSo, it will take the car 6 hours to overtake the train."
