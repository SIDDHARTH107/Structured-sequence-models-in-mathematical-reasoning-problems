    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 120, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Let's find the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor 2 (p = 2):\nThe number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide the index (120/2^3 = 15), and n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. \n\nFor 3 (p = 3):\nThe number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the index (120/3 = 40), and n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, or 10.\n\nFor 5 (p = 5):\nThe number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide the index (120/5 = 24), and n_5 must be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possible value for n_5 is 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for the Sylow subgroups.\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime factor, and the group is the direct product of these subgroups. In this case, the group is isomorphic to Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5, which is an abelian group.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is isomorphic to the semidirect product (Z_8 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_5. There are two non-abelian groups in this case: the dihedral group D_40 and the dicyclic group Q_40.\n\n3. If n_2 = 5, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is isomorphic to the semidirect product (Z_8 × Z_5) ⋊ Z_3. There is one non-abelian group in this case: the Frobenius group F_120.\n\n4. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is isomorphic to the semidirect product (Z_8 × Z_15) ⋊ Z_2. There is one non-abelian group in this case: the dihedral group D_120.\n\n5. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, and n_5 = 1, then the group is isomorphic to the semidirect product (Z_8 × Z_5) ⋊ Z_3. There is one non-abelian group in this case: the Frobenius group F_120.\n\n6. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 1, then the group is isomorphic to the semidirect product (Z_8 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_5. There are two non-abelian groups in this case: the dihedral group D_40 and the dicyclic group Q_40.\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-abelian groups of order 120:\n\n1. Dihedral group D_40 (structure: 2^3 × D_5)\n2. Dicyclic group Q_40 (structure: 2^3 × Q_5)\n3. Frobenius group F_120 (structure: 2^3 × F_15)\n4. Dihedral group D_120 (structure: 2^3 × D_15)\n5. Frobenius group F_120 (structure: 2^3 × F_15)\n\nNote that the Frobenius group F_120 appears twice, but it is the same group."
