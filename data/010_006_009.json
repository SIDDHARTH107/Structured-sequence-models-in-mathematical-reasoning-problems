    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of the space obtained by attaching a Möbius strip to a circle, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two path-connected open sets A and B, then the fundamental group of X, π₁(X), can be computed from the fundamental groups of A, B, and their intersection A ∩ B.\n\nLet's consider the space X as the union of a Möbius strip M and a circle C. We can choose A to be the Möbius strip M with a small open disk removed from its center, and B to be an open annulus containing the circle C and the boundary of the removed disk from A. Both A and B are path-connected open sets.\n\nNow, we need to find the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B.\n\n1. A is homotopy equivalent to the Möbius strip, so π₁(A) ≅ π₁(M). The Möbius strip is non-orientable, but its fundamental group is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the circle, which is the infinite cyclic group Z. So, π₁(A) ≅ Z.\n\n2. B is an open annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle. So, π₁(B) ≅ Z.\n\n3. A ∩ B is the boundary of the removed disk in A, which is a circle. So, π₁(A ∩ B) ≅ Z.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group π₁(X) is the free product of π₁(A) and π₁(B) with the amalgamation of π₁(A ∩ B). In this case, we have:\n\nπ₁(X) ≅ π₁(A) * π₁(B) / N(π₁(A ∩ B)) ≅ Z * Z / Z ≅ Z * Z.\n\nHere, N(π₁(A ∩ B)) is the normal subgroup generated by the image of π₁(A ∩ B) in π₁(A) and π₁(B). Since the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B are all isomorphic to Z, the amalgamation is just the common Z factor.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the space obtained by attaching a Möbius strip to a circle is isomorphic to the free product of two infinite cyclic groups, which is the group Z * Z."
