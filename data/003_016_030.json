    "message_1": "A sinusoidal function is represented by the equation y = 3sin(2x - pi/3). Determine the phase shift of the function.",
    "message_2": "The general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 3sin(2x - pi/3), we can see that A = 3, B = 2, and the expression inside the sine function is (2x - pi/3). To find the phase shift, we need to rewrite the expression in the form B(x - C).\n\n2x - pi/3 = 2(x - pi/6)\n\nNow, we can see that the phase shift C = pi/6. The function is shifted pi/6 units to the right."
