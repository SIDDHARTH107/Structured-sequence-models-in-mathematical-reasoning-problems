    "message_1": "In a country with 50 districts, the probability of a certain political event occurring in any one district is 0.2. What is the probability that the event will occur in at least 10 districts?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of the event occurring exactly k times\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of districts)\n- k is the number of successful trials (in this case, the number of districts where the event occurs)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.2)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.8)\n\nWe want to find the probability that the event will occur in at least 10 districts, which means we need to find the probability of it occurring in 10, 11, 12, ..., 50 districts. We can do this by summing the probabilities for each of these cases:\n\nP(X >= 10) = P(X = 10) + P(X = 11) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nWe can calculate each of these probabilities using the binomial probability formula and then sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 10) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.2)^k * (0.8)^(50-k)] for k = 10 to 50\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 10) ≈ 0.9829\n\nSo, the probability that the event will occur in at least 10 districts is approximately 0.9829 or 98.29%."
