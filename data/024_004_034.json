    "message_2": "To determine the mean curvature of a cylindrical surface, we need to find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) and then calculate the mean curvature as H = (k1 + k2) / 2.\n\nFor a cylinder, one of the principal curvatures (k1) is always 0, as there is no curvature along the height of the cylinder. The other principal curvature (k2) is the reciprocal of the radius of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the cylinder is 4 cm, so k2 = 1 / 4 cm = 0.25 cm^(-1).\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\nH = (0 + 0.25) / 2\nH = 0.25 / 2\nH = 0.125 cm^(-1)\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at a point located 2 cm from the top of the cylinder is 0.125 cm^(-1)."
