    "message_1": "A car is moving along a straight road with a velocity of 20 m/s. After 10 seconds its velocity becomes 40 m/s. Using calculus, find the acceleration of the car.",
    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car, we can use calculus to determine the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Let v(t) be the velocity function of the car, where t is time in seconds.\n\nWe are given that v(0) = 20 m/s and v(10) = 40 m/s. We can assume that the acceleration is constant, which means the velocity function is linear with respect to time. Therefore, we can write the velocity function as:\n\nv(t) = at + b\n\nwhere a is the acceleration and b is the initial velocity (20 m/s).\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find the acceleration:\n\nv(0) = 20 = a(0) + b\nb = 20\n\nv(10) = 40 = a(10) + 20\n\nNow, we can solve for the acceleration a:\n\n40 = 10a + 20\n20 = 10a\na = 2 m/s²\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car is 2 m/s²."
