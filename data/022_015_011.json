    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Schwarz Lemma, which states that if g(z) is an analytic function in the unit disk U = {z : |z| < 1} such that g(0) = 0 and |g(z)| ≤ 1 for all z in U, then |g(z)| ≤ |z| for all z in U and if |g(z)| = |z| for some z ≠ 0, then g(z) = az for some constant a with |a| = 1.\n\nNow, consider the function g(z) = f(z)/z. Since f(z) is analytic in U and f(0) = 0, g(z) is also analytic in U except at z = 0. However, we can define g(0) = f'(0) (which exists since f(z) is analytic), making g(z) analytic in the entire unit disk U.\n\nNext, we need to show that |g(z)| ≤ 1 for all z in U. For z ≠ 0, we have:\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z)/z| = |f(z)|/|z|\n\nSince |f(z)| ≤ 1 and |z| < 1, we have:\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z)|/|z| ≤ 1/|z| * |z| = 1\n\nFor z = 0, we have g(0) = f'(0). By Cauchy's integral formula for the derivative, we have:\n\nf'(0) = (1/(2πi)) ∫(f(z)/z^2) dz\n\nTaking the absolute value of both sides and applying the triangle inequality, we get:\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (1/(2π)) ∫|f(z)/z^2| |dz|\n\nSince |f(z)| ≤ 1 and |z| < 1, we have:\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (1/(2π)) ∫(1/|z|^2) |dz|\n\nEvaluating the integral over the unit circle, we get:\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (1/(2π)) * 2π = 1\n\nThus, |g(z)| ≤ 1 for all z in U.\n\nNow, we can apply the Schwarz Lemma to g(z). Since g(z) is analytic in U, g(0) = f'(0), and |g(z)| ≤ 1 for all z in U, we have:\n\n|f(z)/z| ≤ |z|/|z| = 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by |z|, we get:\n\n|f(z)| ≤ |z|\n\nfor all z in U, as desired."
