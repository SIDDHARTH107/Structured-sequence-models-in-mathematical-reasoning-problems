    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct formulas that can be constructed using second-order logic with one predicate symbol and two variables, we need to consider the various components of second-order logic and the possible combinations. \n\nLet's denote the predicate symbol as P, and the two variables as x and y. Here are the basic components of second-order logic:\n\n1. Atomic formulas: These are the simplest formulas, consisting of a predicate symbol applied to variables or terms. In our case, we have P(x), P(y), and P(x, y).\n\n2. Negation: We can negate atomic formulas, resulting in ¬P(x), ¬P(y), and ¬P(x, y).\n\n3. Conjunction and Disjunction: We can connect formulas using \"and\" (∧) and \"or\" (∨). For example, P(x) ∧ P(y), P(x) ∨ P(y), ¬P(x) ∧ ¬P(y), and so on.\n\n4. Quantifiers: Second-order logic includes two types of quantifiers: universal (∀) and existential (∃). We can apply these quantifiers to the variables x and y. Examples include ∀x P(x), ∃x P(x), ∀x ∀y P(x, y), and ∃x ∃y P(x, y).\n\nNow, let's count the distinct formulas:\n\n1. Atomic formulas: 3 (P(x), P(y), P(x, y))\n\n2. Negations: 3 (¬P(x), ¬P(y), ¬P(x, y))\n\n3. Conjunctions and Disjunctions: We can combine the 6 formulas from steps 1 and 2 in pairs, resulting in 6 choose 2 = 15 combinations. However, since conjunction and disjunction are commutative, we need to divide this by 2 to avoid double-counting, giving us 7 distinct formulas.\n\n4. Quantifiers: We can apply quantifiers to the 6 formulas from steps 1 and 2, resulting in 12 formulas (2 quantifiers × 2 variables × 3 formulas). Additionally, we can apply quantifiers to the 7 formulas from step 3, resulting in 28 formulas (2 quantifiers × 2 variables × 7 formulas). In total, we have 40 distinct formulas involving quantifiers.\n\nAdding up the results from each step, we have a total of 3 + 3 + 7 + 40 = 53 distinct formulas that can be constructed using second-order logic with one predicate symbol and two variables."
