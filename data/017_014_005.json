    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C20, D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20, we will analyze the properties of these groups and use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p, if p^k is the highest power of p that divides the order of a group G (|G|), then G has a subgroup of order p^k, called a Sylow p-subgroup.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted n_p, divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup, and n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G of order 20. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5^1. By the Sylow theorems, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups n_5 divides 4 (the index [G : P_5]) and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it must be normal in G since all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, and the only conjugate of a normal subgroup is itself.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, then G is abelian and has a unique subgroup of order 20. In this case, G would be generated by an element of order 20.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, then G is non-abelian and has 10 elements of order 2 and 10 elements of order 1 or 10. In this case, G would have a normal cyclic subgroup of order 10.\n\n3. If G is the non-abelian group of order 20, then G is non-abelian and has a normal cyclic subgroup of order 5 and a non-normal cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n\nSince G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, we can rule out the possibility of G being isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20 with a non-normal cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroup P_2. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups n_2 divides 5 (the index [G : P_2]) and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities for n_2 are 1 or 5.\n\nIf n_2 = 1, then G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup, and by the properties of normal subgroups, the internal direct product of the normal Sylow 2-subgroup and the normal Sylow 5-subgroup would give us an abelian group. In this case, G would be isomorphic to the cyclic group C20.\n\nIf n_2 = 5, then G has 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G. In this case, G would be isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20 or the dihedral group D10, depending on the properties of its Sylow 2-subgroup. To determine which one G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the structure of G and its Sylow 2-subgroup."
