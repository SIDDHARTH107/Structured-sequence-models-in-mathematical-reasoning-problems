    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(3x) - 3cos(x) = 2, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the trigonometric functions\nAdd 3cos(x) to both sides of the equation:\n\n2sin(3x) = 3cos(x) + 2\n\nStep 2: Use the double angle and triple angle formulas\nWe can rewrite the equation using the double angle formula for cosine and the triple angle formula for sine:\n\n2sin(3x) = 3(2cos^2(x) - 1) + 2\n\nStep 3: Substitute y = cos(x)\nLet y = cos(x). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(3x) = 6y^2 - 3 + 2\n\nStep 4: Express sin(3x) in terms of cos(x)\nUsing the triple angle formula for sine, we have:\n\nsin(3x) = 3cos(x) - 4cos^3(x)\n\nSubstitute y = cos(x) back into the equation:\n\n2(3y - 4y^3) = 6y^2 - 1\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n\n6y - 8y^3 = 6y^2 - 1\n\nRearrange the equation to form a cubic equation:\n\n8y^3 + 6y^2 - 6y + 1 = 0\n\nStep 6: Solve the cubic equation\nUnfortunately, there is no general formula for solving cubic equations. However, we can use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator, to find the approximate solutions for y (cos(x)).\n\nStep 7: Find the values of x\nOnce we have the approximate values of y (cos(x)), we can use the inverse cosine function (arccos) to find the corresponding values of x. Keep in mind that there might be multiple solutions for x within the given domain, so it's essential to consider the periodicity of the trigonometric functions when finding the solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, solving the equation 2sin(3x) - 3cos(x) = 2 involves using trigonometric identities, substitution, and numerical methods to find the approximate solutions for x."
