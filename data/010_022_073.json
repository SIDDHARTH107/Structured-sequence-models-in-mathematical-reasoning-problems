    "message_1": "A wire of 20 cm length is bent into the shape of a circle. A regular hexagon is inscribed inside the circle. Determine the side length of the hexagon.",
    "message_2": "To find the side length of the inscribed hexagon, we first need to find the radius of the circle.\n\nThe circumference of the circle is equal to the length of the wire, which is 20 cm. The formula for the circumference of a circle is:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nWhere C is the circumference, and r is the radius. We can solve for r:\n\n20 = 2 * π * r\nr = 20 / (2 * π)\nr ≈ 3.1831 cm\n\nNow, we can find the side length of the inscribed hexagon. A regular hexagon can be divided into 12 congruent equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center of the hexagon to each vertex. The central angle of each equilateral triangle is 360° / 12 = 30°.\n\nWe can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the side length of the hexagon. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30° angle is half the length of the hypotenuse (which is the radius of the circle in this case). So, the side length of the equilateral triangle (and the hexagon) is:\n\nSide length = r / 2\nSide length ≈ 3.1831 / 2\nSide length ≈ 1.5915 cm\n\nTherefore, the side length of the inscribed hexagon is approximately 1.5915 cm."
