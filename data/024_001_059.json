    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t:\n\nx'(t) = -3 sin(t)\ny'(t) = 3 cos(t)\nz'(t) = 4\n\nx''(t) = -3 cos(t)\ny''(t) = -3 sin(t)\nz''(t) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) at t = π/2.\n\nThe formula for curvature is:\n\nk(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nwhere r'(t) = <x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)> and r''(t) = <x''(t), y''(t), z''(t)>.\n\nAt t = π/2:\n\nr'(π/2) = <-3, 0, 4>\nr''(π/2) = <0, -3, 0>\n\nNow, we compute the cross product r'(t) x r''(t):\n\nr'(π/2) x r''(π/2) = <12, 0, 9>\n\nNext, we find the magnitudes:\n\n||r'(π/2)|| = √((-3)^2 + 0^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = 5\n\n||r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)|| = √(12^2 + 0^2 + 9^2) = √(144 + 81) = 15\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nk(π/2) = 15 / (5^3) = 15 / 125 = 3/25\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ). The formula for torsion is:\n\nτ(t) = (r'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t))) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nAt t = π/2:\n\nr'(π/2) • (r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)) = (-3)(12) + 0(0) + 4(9) = -36 + 36 = 0\n\n||r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)||^2 = (15)^2 = 225\n\nSo, the torsion is:\n\nτ(π/2) = 0 / 225 = 0\n\nThus, the curvature at t = π/2 is 3/25 and the torsion is 0."
