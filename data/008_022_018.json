Check the condition number of the matrix obtained from the coefficients of the variables and determine whether the matrix is ill-conditioned or not.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n[2 3 | 8]\n[4 6 | 16]\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination. We can start by dividing the first row by 2:\n\n[1 1.5 | 4]\n[4 6  | 16]\n\nNext, we'll subtract 4 times the first row from the second row to eliminate the x term in the second row:\n\n[1 1.5 |  4]\n[0 0   |  0]\n\nThe second row now represents the equation 0x + 0y = 0, which is true for any values of x and y. This means that the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, and we cannot find unique values for x and y.\n\nNow, let's calculate the condition number of the matrix obtained from the coefficients of the variables. The condition number is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. First, we need to find the matrix's norm. We'll use the infinity norm, which is the maximum absolute row sum:\n\n||A||âˆž = max(2 + 3, 4 + 6) = max(5, 10) = 10\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse of the matrix A:\n\nA = [2 3]\n      [4 6]\n\nHowever, we can see that the determinant of A is 0 (2*6 - 3*4 = 0), which means that A is singular and does not have an inverse. Since the inverse does not exist, the condition number is undefined.\n\nIn general, a matrix with a large condition number is considered ill-conditioned, as it can lead to numerical instability and large errors in the solution. In this case, since the condition number is undefined, we can conclude that the matrix is ill-conditioned."
