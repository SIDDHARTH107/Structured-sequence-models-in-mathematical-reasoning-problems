    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant, denoted by δ, is a universal constant that characterizes the period-doubling route to chaos for one-dimensional discrete maps. Its value is approximately:\n\nδ ≈ 4.669201609102990671853203821578\n\nThis constant was discovered by the American mathematician Mitchell Feigenbaum in the 1970s. It is a mathematical constant that appears in various chaotic systems and bifurcation diagrams."
