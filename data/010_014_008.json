    "message_1": "Let X be a topological space. Suppose that H^n(X;Z) is isomorphic to Z for some n>0. What is the order of H^{n+1}(X;Z)?",
    "message_2": "The order of a group is the number of its elements. In the case of cohomology groups H^k(X;Z), the order refers to the rank of the group when it is finitely generated. However, without more information about the topological space X, it is impossible to determine the order of H^{n+1}(X;Z) just from the given information about H^n(X;Z). The cohomology groups of a topological space can vary greatly depending on its structure, and knowing the order of one cohomology group does not necessarily provide information about the orders of other cohomology groups."
