    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P(4 cm, 4 cm, 0) due to the current-carrying wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a distance r is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the small current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point P.\n\nSince the wire lies along the x-axis, we can consider a small current element dx at a distance x from the origin. The position vector r from the current element to point P is given by:\n\nr = <4 - x, 4, 0>\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt((4 - x)² + 4²) = sqrt(x² - 8x + 32)\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field dB due to the small current element dx at point P:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * dx x r) / |r|³\n\nSince the wire is along the x-axis and the magnetic field is in the y-z plane, the cross product dx x r will have only the z-component:\n\ndx x r = <0, 0, 4dx>\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field dB:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * 4dx) / (x² - 8x + 32)³/2\n\ndB = (8μ₀ / 4π) * dx / (x² - 8x + 32)³/2\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at point P, we need to integrate dB over the length of the wire (from x = 0 to x = 20 cm):\n\nB = ∫(8μ₀ / 4π) * dx / (x² - 8x + 32)³/2 from 0 to 20\n\nB = (2μ₀ / π) * ∫dx / (x² - 8x + 32)³/2 from 0 to 20\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution:\n\nLet u = x - 4, then du = dx\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (2μ₀ / π) * ∫du / (u² + 16)³/2 from -4 to 16\n\nThis integral can be solved using a standard integral table or software:\n\nB = (2μ₀ / π) * [1 / (3 * sqrt(u² + 16))] from -4 to 16\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nB = (2μ₀ / π) * [1 / (3 * sqrt(16² + 16)) - 1 / (3 * sqrt((-4)² + 16))]\n\nB = (2μ₀ / π) * [1 / (3 * sqrt(272)) - 1 / (3 * sqrt(32))]\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of μ₀:\n\nB = (2 * 4π × 10^−7 T.m/A / π) * [1 / (3 * sqrt(272)) - 1 / (3 * sqrt(32))]\n\nB = (8π × 10^−7 T.m/A) * [1 / (3 * sqrt(272)) - 1 / (3 * sqrt(32))]\n\nB ≈ 1.97 × 10^−6 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P(4 cm, 4 cm, 0) due to the current-carrying wire is approximately 1.97 × 10^−6 T."
