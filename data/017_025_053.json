    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. The order of the group is 120, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, we can determine the possible number of Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- Number of 5-Sylow subgroups: 1, 6 (since it must divide 120/5 = 24 and be congruent to 1 mod 5)\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- Number of 3-Sylow subgroups: 1, 4 (since it must divide 120/3 = 40 and be congruent to 1 mod 3)\n\nNow, we are given that there is a normal subgroup of order 5 and a normal subgroup of order 3. This means that there must be exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup and one 3-Sylow subgroup, as normal subgroups are unique.\n\nSince there is a unique normal 5-Sylow subgroup and a unique normal 3-Sylow subgroup, we can form a direct product of these subgroups, which will also be normal. The direct product of these subgroups will have order 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nNow, we have a normal subgroup of order 15 in our group of order 120. The factor group G/N, where G is our group and N is the normal subgroup of order 15, will have order 120/15 = 8. This factor group is isomorphic to one of the groups of order 8, which are:\n\n1. Z_8 (cyclic group of order 8)\n2. Z_4 × Z_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 2)\n3. D_4 (dihedral group of order 8)\n4. Q_8 (quaternion group of order 8)\n\nNow, we can use the correspondence theorem to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120 that contain a normal subgroup of order 5 and a normal subgroup of order 3. The correspondence theorem states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of the factor group G/N and the subgroups of G that contain N.\n\nSo, for each of the four groups of order 8, there is a corresponding group of order 120 that contains a normal subgroup of order 5 and a normal subgroup of order 3. Therefore, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 120 that contain a normal subgroup of order 5 and a normal subgroup of order 3."
