    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem related to Proof theory:\n\nProve that the sum of any two odd numbers is an even number.\n\nHint: You can start by defining odd numbers as numbers that cannot be evenly divided by 2 (i.e., they leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2). Then, you can use proof by contradiction to show that the sum of two odd numbers must always be even.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the sum of any two odd numbers is an even number, we can use an algebraic approach. Let's define two odd numbers as follows:\n\nLet A = 2m + 1, where m is an integer.\nLet B = 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of A and B:\n\nA + B = (2m + 1) + (2n + 1)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nA + B = 2m + 2n + 2\n\nFactor out the common factor of 2:\n\nA + B = 2(m + n + 1)\n\nLet C = m + n + 1, where C is also an integer since the sum of integers is an integer.\n\nA + B = 2C\n\nSince the sum of A and B can be written as 2 times an integer (C), the sum of any two odd numbers (A and B) is an even number. This proves the statement."
