    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the finite field F13, we will use the Hasse's theorem. According to Hasse's theorem, the number of points N on the elliptic curve over a finite field Fp (where p is a prime number) is bounded by the following inequality:\n\np + 1 - 2√p ≤ N ≤ p + 1 + 2√p\n\nIn our case, p = 13. So, we have:\n\n13 + 1 - 2√13 ≤ N ≤ 13 + 1 + 2√13\n4.54 ≤ N ≤ 21.46\n\nSince N must be an integer, we have 5 ≤ N ≤ 21.\n\nNow, we will find the points on the elliptic curve over F13. We will check all possible combinations of x and y in F13 and see if they satisfy the given equation.\n\nThe points on the elliptic curve are:\n\n(0, 3), (0, 10), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 10), (3, 1), (3, 12), (4, 4), (4, 9), (5, 0), (6, 2), (6, 11), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 10), (9, 5), (9, 8), (10, 1), (10, 12), (11, 4), (11, 9), (12, 2), (12, 11)\n\nThere are 25 points in total, but we need to subtract the point at infinity, which is always included in the elliptic curve. So, the order of the elliptic curve is:\n\nN = 25 - 1 = 24"
