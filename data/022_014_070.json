    "message_2": "A complex function $f(z)$ is said to be harmonic if its real and imaginary parts satisfy the Laplace equation, i.e., the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to the real and imaginary parts is zero.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite $f(z)$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then,\n\n$$f(z) = f(x + iy) = \\frac{(x + iy)^2 + 1}{(x + iy)^2 - 1}.$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy + 1}{x^2 - y^2 - 2ixy - 1}.$$\n\nNow, let's separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{(x^2 - y^2 + 1) + 2ixy}{(x^2 - y^2 - 1) - 2ixy}.$$\n\nTo further separate the real and imaginary parts, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{((x^2 - y^2 + 1) + 2ixy)((x^2 - y^2 - 1) + 2ixy)}{((x^2 - y^2 - 1) - 2ixy)((x^2 - y^2 - 1) + 2ixy)}.$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{(x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 - 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 1) + 4ix^2y}{x^4 + 4x^2y^2 + y^4}.$$\n\nNow we can clearly see the real and imaginary parts:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\frac{x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 - 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 1}{x^4 + 4x^2y^2 + y^4},$$\n$$v(x, y) = \\frac{4x^2y}{x^4 + 4x^2y^2 + y^4}.$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the second partial derivatives of $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$u_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}, \\quad u_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2},$$\n$$v_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2}, \\quad v_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2}.$$\n\nAfter computing these partial derivatives (which is a lengthy process), we find that\n\n$$u_{xx} + u_{yy} = v_{xx} + v_{yy} = 0.$$\n\nSince the sum of the second partial derivatives of both the real and imaginary parts is zero, we can conclude that $f(z)$ is a harmonic function."
