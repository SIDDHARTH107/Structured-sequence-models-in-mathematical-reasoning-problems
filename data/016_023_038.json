    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(r)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and r is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal with the given construction, each equilateral triangle is replaced by 3 smaller equilateral triangles, so N = 3. The scaling factor is 3, as each smaller triangle is 1/3 the size of the original triangle.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(3) / log(3)\n\nD = 1\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with the given construction is 1."
