    "message_2": "To find the total area of the rectangular field, we need to find the maximum width of the field since the width is given by the function W(x) = 4x - x^2. \n\nTo find the maximum width, we can find the vertex of the parabola represented by the function W(x). The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic function W(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. In this case, a = -1 and b = 4.\n\nx = -4 / (2 * -1) = 2\n\nNow, we can find the maximum width by plugging the x-coordinate of the vertex back into the function:\n\nW(2) = 4(2) - (2)^2 = 8 - 4 = 4 meters\n\nNow that we have the maximum width, we can find the total area of the field by multiplying the length and the width:\n\nArea = Length * Width = 40 meters * 4 meters = 160 square meters\n\nSo, the total area of the field is 160 square meters."
