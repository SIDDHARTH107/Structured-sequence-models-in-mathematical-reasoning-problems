    "message_2": "To form groups of 3 students from a class of 15 students, the teacher can use combinations. The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 15 (the number of students) and k = 3 (the number of students in each group). We will first find the number of ways to form the first group:\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3!(15-3)!) = 15! / (3!12!) = (15 × 14 × 13) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 455\n\nNow, there are 12 students left. We will find the number of ways to form the second group:\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12-3)!) = 12! / (3!9!) = (12 × 11 × 10) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 220\n\nNow, there are 9 students left. We will find the number of ways to form the third group:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!) = 9! / (3!6!) = (9 × 8 × 7) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 84\n\nNow, there are 6 students left. We will find the number of ways to form the fourth group:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 20\n\nNow, there are 3 students left, and they will form the last group. There is only 1 way to form this group since all students must be in a group.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to form all the groups, we multiply the number of ways for each group:\n\nTotal number of ways = 455 × 220 × 84 × 20 × 1 = 16816800\n\nSo, the teacher can form groups in 16,816,800 different ways such that each student is in exactly one group."
