    "message_1": "In a certain population, the probability of individuals having a certain medical condition is 0.15. If a random sample of 200 individuals is taken from this population, what is the probability that exactly 30 of them have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, individuals with the medical condition) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (having the medical condition) in a single trial\n- n is the number of trials (sample size)\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 200 (sample size)\n- k = 30 (number of individuals with the medical condition)\n- p = 0.15 (probability of having the medical condition)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(200, 30):\n\nC(200, 30) = 200! / (30!(200-30)!)\nC(200, 30) = 200! / (30!170!)\n\nNow, let's calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):\n\np^k = 0.15^30\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.15)^(200-30) = 0.85^170\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 30) = C(200, 30) * 0.15^30 * 0.85^170\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 30) â‰ˆ 0.0393\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 30 out of 200 individuals have the medical condition is approximately 0.0393 or 3.93%."
