    "message_1": "In a magic show, a magician has a trick where he randomly selects a card from a deck of 52 cards. The probability of selecting a heart card is 1/4, and the probability of selecting a spade card is 1/5. What is the probability of the magician selecting either a heart card or a spade card from the deck?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting either a heart card or a spade card, we can simply add the probabilities of selecting each type of card individually. However, since there is no overlap between heart cards and spade cards, we don't need to worry about subtracting any overlapping probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting either a heart card or a spade card is:\n\nP(Heart or Spade) = P(Heart) + P(Spade) = 1/4 + 1/5\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 20. So, we have:\n\nP(Heart or Spade) = 5/20 + 4/20 = 9/20\n\nTherefore, the probability of the magician selecting either a heart card or a spade card from the deck is 9/20."
