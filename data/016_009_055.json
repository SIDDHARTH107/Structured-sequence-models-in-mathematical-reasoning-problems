    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10/2))\n\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\n\nLength = 1 * 32\n\nLength = 32\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations with an initial segment length of 1 is 32."
