    "message_1": "A triangle has a side of length 10 and an angle of 60 degrees opposite that side, while another side has a length of 7 with an angle of 40 degrees opposite that side. Find the length of the third side using the law of cosines.",
    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle as follows: let A be the vertex with the angle of 60 degrees, B be the vertex with the angle of 40 degrees, and C be the remaining vertex. Let a = 7, b = 10, and c be the length of the third side, which we want to find.\n\nAccording to the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nWe know a, b, and the angles A and B, but we need to find the angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can find angle C as follows:\n\nC = 180 - (A + B) = 180 - (60 + 40) = 180 - 100 = 80 degrees\n\nNow we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side c:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\nc^2 = 7^2 + 10^2 - 2 * 7 * 10 * cos(80)\nc^2 = 49 + 100 - 140 * cos(80)\nc^2 ≈ 149 - 48.54\nc^2 ≈ 100.46\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc ≈ √100.46\nc ≈ 10.02\n\nSo, the length of the third side is approximately 10.02 units."
