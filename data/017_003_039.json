Prove that there exists an element g in G such that the subgroup generated by g coincides with G; that is, g^n = e, where e is the identity element of G and n is the order of g. \n\nFind such an element and its order for the group of prime order 11. ",
    "message_2": "To prove that every group of prime order is cyclic, we will use Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of a subgroup H of a finite group G divides the order of G. \n\nLet G be a group of prime order p. Since p is prime, the only divisors of p are 1 and p itself. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and p. \n\nNow, let g be an element of G. Since g is an element of G, it generates a subgroup H = ⟨g⟩. The order of H, denoted as |H|, is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, |H| must divide the order of G, which is p. Since the only divisors of p are 1 and p, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. |H| = 1: In this case, H = {e}, which means g = e. This is only true for the identity element of G.\n2. |H| = p: In this case, H = G, which means the subgroup generated by g coincides with G.\n\nSince we are looking for an element g in G such that the subgroup generated by g coincides with G, we need to find an element with order p.\n\nNow, let's find such an element and its order for the group of prime order 11.\n\nConsider the group G = Z_11, the additive group of integers modulo 11. The elements of G are {0, 1, 2, ..., 10}, and the group operation is addition modulo 11.\n\nWe want to find an element g in G such that the subgroup generated by g coincides with G. In other words, we want to find an element g with order 11.\n\nLet's try the element g = 1. The multiples of 1 modulo 11 are:\n\n1 * 1 = 1 (mod 11)\n1 * 2 = 2 (mod 11)\n1 * 3 = 3 (mod 11)\n...\n1 * 10 = 10 (mod 11)\n1 * 11 = 0 (mod 11)\n\nWe can see that the subgroup generated by 1 is {0, 1, 2, ..., 10}, which coincides with G. Therefore, the element g = 1 has order 11, and the group G = Z_11 is cyclic."
