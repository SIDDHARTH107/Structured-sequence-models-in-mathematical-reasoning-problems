    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. To find the size of the power set of A, we can use the fact that each element in A has two possibilities: either it is in a particular subset or it is not. Therefore, for n elements, there are 2^n possible combinations of subsets.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set of A to the size of A itself. The size of A is n, and the size of P(A) is 2^n. We want to show that 2^n > n for all n.\n\nProof by induction:\n\nBase case: Let n = 1. Then, A has 1 element, and P(A) has 2^1 = 2 subsets (the empty set and the set containing the single element). In this case, 2^1 > 1, so the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that for some integer k, 2^k > k. We want to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1).\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k (by properties of exponents)\n\nSince 2^k > k (by the inductive hypothesis), it follows that 2 * 2^k > 2 * k. Now, we just need to show that 2 * k >= k + 1.\n\n2 * k >= k + 1\nk >= 1\n\nThe inequality holds for all k >= 1, which is true for all sets with at least one element.\n\nThus, by induction, the size of the power set of A (2^n) is always strictly larger than the size of A (n) for all n."
