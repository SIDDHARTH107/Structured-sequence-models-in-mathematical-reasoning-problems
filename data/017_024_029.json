    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 96. We know that the order of G can be written as 96 = 2^5 * 3^1. By the Sylow Theorems, we can find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nLet n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^1 = 3, so n_2 is either 1 or 3.\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2, so n_2 is either 1 or 3.\n\nThus, there are either 1 or 3 distinct Sylow 2-subgroups of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G. If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then that subgroup is normal in G. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, and let P_3 be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are relatively prime, by the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. In this case, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96 or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nIf G has 3 distinct Sylow 2-subgroups, then G is not a simple group. Let N be a normal subgroup of G with order 2^4 = 16. Then G/N has order 6, and by the Correspondence Theorem, G/N has a normal subgroup of order 3. Let H be the preimage of this subgroup under the quotient map. Then H has order 3, and since the orders of N and H are relatively prime, G is a semidirect product of N and H.\n\nIn this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, since A4 has order 12 and is the smallest non-abelian group of order divisible by 3.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 96 has either 1 or 3 distinct Sylow 2-subgroups, and it is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96."
