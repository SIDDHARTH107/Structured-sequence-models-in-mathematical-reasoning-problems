    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2/x) + (3/2x) = 1, we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for x and 2x is 2x. \n\nNow, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(2/x) * (2/2) + (3/2x) = (4/2x) + (3/2x)\n\nNow that the fractions have the same denominator, we can add them:\n\n(4/2x) + (3/2x) = (4+3)/2x = 7/2x\n\nNow we have:\n\n7/2x = 1\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2x:\n\n(7/2x) * (2x) = 1 * (2x)\n\nThe 2x on the left side of the equation cancels out, leaving:\n\n7 = 2x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n7/2 = x\n\nSo, the solution is x = 7/2."
