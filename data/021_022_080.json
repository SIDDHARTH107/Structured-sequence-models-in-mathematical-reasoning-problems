    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, product A and product B. The profit per unit for product A is $10 and for product B is $15. The production process takes 4 hours for product A and 6 hours for product B. The company has a total of 2400 hours of production time available in a month. Using firefly algorithm, what would be the optimal production plan to maximize the total profit of the company?",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is not easily applied to a simple linear programming problem like this one. Instead, we can solve this problem using a more straightforward approach.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraint:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 2400 (production time constraint)\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequality for y:\n\ny ≤ (2400 - 4x) / 6\ny ≤ (2 - (2/3)x)\n\nNow, we'll find the critical points by setting the partial derivatives of the profit function equal to zero:\n\ndP/dx = 10 - 0 = 10\ndP/dy = 0 - 15 = -15\n\nSince the partial derivatives are constants, there are no critical points. Therefore, the maximum profit must occur at the boundary of the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the constraint:\n\ny ≤ (2 - (2/3)x)\n\nThe boundary points are:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 400 (2400/6)\n2. x = 600 (2400/4), y = 0\n3. The intersection of the constraint line and the x-axis (x = 900, y = 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at these boundary points:\n\n1. P(0, 400) = 10(0) + 15(400) = $6000\n2. P(600, 0) = 10(600) + 15(0) = $6000\n3. P(900, 0) = 10(900) + 15(0) = $9000\n\nThe maximum profit of $9000 occurs when the company produces 900 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
