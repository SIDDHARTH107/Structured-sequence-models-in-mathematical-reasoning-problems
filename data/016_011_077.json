    "message_1": "Suppose the original Vicsek fractal has a side length of 1 unit. If you were to create a new Vicsek fractal by replacing each square in the original fractal with a smaller copy in the same shape but 1/3 the size, how many squares would be in the new fractal?",
    "message_2": "The original Vicsek fractal consists of 5 squares: one in the center and four in the corners. When we replace each square with a smaller copy that is 1/3 the size, we will have 5 smaller copies for each of the original 5 squares.\n\nSo, the number of squares in the new fractal will be 5 * 5 = 25 squares."
