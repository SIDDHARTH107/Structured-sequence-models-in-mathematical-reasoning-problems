Analyze the time-series data and forecast the sales for the next 3 months.\n\n| Month | Sales (in thousands) |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| Jan   | 50                  |\n| Feb   | 70                   |\n| Mar   | 80                   |\n| Apr   | 90                   |\n| May   | 100                 |\n| Jun   | 120                 |\n| Jul   | 130                 |\n| Aug   | 140                 |\n| Sep   | 160                 |\n| Oct   | 180                 |\n| Nov   | 200                 |\n| Dec   | 220                 |",
    "message_2": "To forecast the sales for the next 3 months, we can use a simple linear regression model. First, let's assign numerical values to the months, starting with January as 1 and December as 12.\n\n| Month | Sales (in thousands) | Month (numerical) |\n|-------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Jan   | 50                  | 1                 |\n| Feb   | 70                  | 2                 |\n| Mar   | 80                  | 3                 |\n| Apr   | 90                  | 4                 |\n| May   | 100                 | 5                 |\n| Jun   | 120                 | 6                 |\n| Jul   | 130                 | 7                 |\n| Aug   | 140                 | 8                 |\n| Sep   | 160                 | 9                 |\n| Oct   | 180                 | 10                |\n| Nov   | 200                 | 11                |\n| Dec   | 220                 | 12                |\n\nNow, let's calculate the mean of the month (numerical) values (x̄) and the mean of the sales values (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12) / 12 = 6.5\nȳ = (50 + 70 + 80 + 90 + 100 + 120 + 130 + 140 + 160 + 180 + 200 + 220) / 12 = 135\n\nNext, we'll calculate the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) for the linear regression model:\n\nb = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\na = ȳ - b * x̄\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)^2 = (1-6.5)^2 + (2-6.5)^2 + ... + (12-6.5)^2 = 429.5\nΣ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = (1-6.5)(50-135) + (2-6.5)(70-135) + ... + (12-6.5)(220-135) = 2145\n\nNow, we can find the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a):\n\nb = 2145 / 429.5 ≈ 4.99\na = 135 - 4.99 * 6.5 ≈ 42.57\n\nThe linear regression model is:\n\nSales = 42.57 + 4.99 * Month\n\nNow, we can forecast the sales for the next 3 months (January, February, and March of the next year) by plugging in the month values (13, 14, and 15) into the model:\n\nSales (Jan) = 42.57 + 4.99 * 13 ≈ 107.5 (in thousands)\nSales (Feb) = 42.57 + 4.99 * 14 ≈ 112.5 (in thousands)\nSales (Mar) = 42.57 + 4.99 * 15 ≈ 117.5 (in thousands)\n\nSo, the forecasted sales for the next 3 months are approximately 107.5, 112.5, and 117.5 thousand units, respectively."
