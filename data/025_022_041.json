Given a Fourier-Mukai kernel 𝒪ₓ on X × Y, where x is a closed point on X, compute the derived direct image Rπ_{Y⋆}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)) where π_Y is the projection X × Y → Y and p_Y is the projection X × Y → Y.",
    "message_2": "To compute the derived direct image Rπ_{Y⋆}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)), we will first need to understand the sheaf 𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1) on X × Y.\n\nSince 𝒪_x is a skyscraper sheaf supported at the point x ∈ X, the tensor product 𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1) will also be supported at the fiber {x} × Y. This is because the tensor product of sheaves is computed pointwise, and 𝒪_x is zero away from x.\n\nNow, let's consider the derived direct image Rπ_{Y⋆}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)). Since 𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1) is supported on {x} × Y, the derived direct image will only have contributions from the cohomology of this fiber.\n\nRecall that the derived direct image is given by the cohomology sheaves R^iπ_{Y⋆}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)), where i is the cohomological degree. We will compute these cohomology sheaves by using the Leray spectral sequence.\n\nThe Leray spectral sequence relates the cohomology of the total space X × Y with the cohomology of the base Y and the cohomology of the fibers. In our case, the spectral sequence will have the form:\n\nE_2^{p, q} = R^pπ_{Y⋆}(R^q(p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1))⊗𝒪_x) => R^{p+q}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)).\n\nSince 𝒪_x is supported at x, the only non-zero term in the E_2 page will be for q=0, and we have:\n\nE_2^{p, 0} = R^pπ_{Y⋆}(p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)⊗𝒪_x).\n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology sheaves R^iπ_{Y⋆}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)) using the Leray spectral sequence. Since the only non-zero term is for q=0, the spectral sequence collapses at the E_2 page, and we have:\n\nR^iπ_{Y⋆}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)) = E_2^{i, 0} = R^iπ_{Y⋆}(p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)⊗𝒪_x).\n\nThus, the derived direct image Rπ_{Y⋆}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)) is given by the complex of sheaves:\n\nR^iπ_{Y⋆}(𝒪_x⊗p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)) = R^iπ_{Y⋆}(p_Y^*𝒪_Y(1)⊗𝒪_x),\n\nwith the only non-zero cohomology sheaves occurring in degrees i for which the cohomology of the fiber {x} × Y is non-zero."
