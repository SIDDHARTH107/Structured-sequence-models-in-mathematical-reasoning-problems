    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the component of the force that is in the direction of the motion. Since the force is applied at an angle of 45 degrees to the direction of motion, we can use the cosine of the angle to find the component of the force in the direction of motion.\n\nF_x = F * cos(45) = 10N * cos(45) = 10N * (1/sqrt(2)) = 5 * sqrt(2) N\n\nNow, we can find the work done by the force using the formula:\n\nWork = F_x * distance\n\nSince the force is constant, we can integrate the force with respect to the distance to find the work done:\n\nWork = ∫(F_x * dx) from 0 to 5\n\nWork = ∫(5 * sqrt(2) * dx) from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nWork = [5 * sqrt(2) * x] from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = (5 * sqrt(2) * 5) - (5 * sqrt(2) * 0)\n\nWork = 25 * sqrt(2) J\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 25 * sqrt(2) Joules."
