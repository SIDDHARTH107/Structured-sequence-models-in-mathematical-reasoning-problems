    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player A is given 100 coins and asked to propose a split with Player B. Player B can either accept or reject the offer. If Player B accepts, both players keep their respective amounts. If Player B rejects, neither player receives any coins. What is the optimal offer for Player A to maximize their own earnings, assuming Player B will accept any offer greater than 10 coins?",
    "message_2": "Since Player B will accept any offer greater than 10 coins, the optimal offer for Player A to maximize their own earnings would be to give Player B 11 coins and keep 89 coins for themselves. This way, Player A ensures that Player B accepts the offer while still keeping the maximum amount of coins for themselves."
