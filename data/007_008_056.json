    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 5^(101) is divided by 101, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn our case, p = 101 (which is a prime number) and a = 5. So, according to Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n5^101 ≡ 5 (mod 101)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 5^(101) is divided by 101 is 5."
