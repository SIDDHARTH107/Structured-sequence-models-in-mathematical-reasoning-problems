    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = x^2 cos(x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together: u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = cos(x).\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\n(fg)' = f'g + fg'\n\nIn our case, u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = cos(x), so we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(x^2)/dx = 2x\nv'(x) = d(cos(x))/dx = -sin(x)\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (2x)(cos(x)) + (x^2)(-sin(x))\nf'(x) = 2x*cos(x) - x^2*sin(x)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^2 cos(x) is f'(x) = 2x*cos(x) - x^2*sin(x)."
