    "message_2": "To show that G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, we have that |G| = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let P be this unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. By the Sylow theorems again, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in P, denoted by n_3(P), satisfies:\n\n1. n_3(P) ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3(P) divides 9\n\nThe only possibility for n_3(P) is 1, so there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup in P, which must be normal in P. Let Q be this unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since |Q| = 3, Q is a cyclic group of order 3. Now, we have a normal subgroup Q of order 3 in P, and P is a normal subgroup of G of order 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms, we have that G is isomorphic to the internal direct product of P and Q, which is a cyclic group of order 27. Thus, G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_3 = 27. In this case, there are 27 Sylow 3-subgroups in G, and none of them are normal in G. Let P be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since |P| = 9, P is either isomorphic to C9 or C3 × C3. If P is isomorphic to C9, then G has an element of order 9, say a. Since G has an element of order 3, say b, we have that G has elements of order 3 and 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms, G is isomorphic to the internal direct product of the cyclic groups generated by a and b, which is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nTherefore, either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
