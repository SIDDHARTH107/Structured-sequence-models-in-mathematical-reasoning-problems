    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of f(t) = e^(2t)cos(3t) for t ≥ 0, we use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st)f(t) dt\n\nIn this case, f(t) = e^(2t)cos(3t). So, we have:\n\nF(s) = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st)e^(2t)cos(3t) dt\n\nCombine the exponentials:\n\nF(s) = ∫[0, ∞] e^((2-s)t)cos(3t) dt\n\nNow, we will use integration by parts to solve this integral. Let u = cos(3t) and dv = e^((2-s)t) dt. Then, du = -3sin(3t) dt and v = (1/(2-s))e^((2-s)t).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nF(s) = [(1/(2-s))e^((2-s)t)cos(3t)](0, ∞) + (3/(2-s))∫[0, ∞] e^((2-s)t)sin(3t) dt\n\nEvaluate the first term:\n\nlim (t→∞) [(1/(2-s))e^((2-s)t)cos(3t)] - [(1/(2-s))e^(0)cos(0)]\n= 0 - (1/(2-s))\n\nSo, the first term is -(1/(2-s)).\n\nNow, we need to solve the second integral. We will use integration by parts again. Let u = sin(3t) and dv = e^((2-s)t) dt. Then, du = 3cos(3t) dt and v = (1/(2-s))e^((2-s)t).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula again:\n\n(3/(2-s))∫[0, ∞] e^((2-s)t)sin(3t) dt = (3/(2-s))[(1/(2-s))e^((2-s)t)sin(3t)](0, ∞) - (3/(2-s))²∫[0, ∞] e^((2-s)t)cos(3t) dt\n\nEvaluate the first term:\n\nlim (t→∞) [(3/(2-s))²e^((2-s)t)sin(3t)] - [(3/(2-s))²e^(0)sin(0)]\n= 0 - 0\n\nSo, the first term is 0.\n\nNow, notice that the second integral is the same as the original integral F(s). Therefore:\n\n(3/(2-s))²F(s) = -(1/(2-s)) + 0\n\nNow, solve for F(s):\n\nF(s) = (1/(2-s))/((3/(2-s))²)\n= (2-s)/((3(2-s))^2)\n= (2-s)/(9(4-4s+s^2))\n= (2-s)/(36-36s+9s^2)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = e^(2t)cos(3t) for t ≥ 0 is:\n\nF(s) = (2-s)/(9s^2 - 36s + 36)"
