    "message_1": "A 15-foot ladder is leaning against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. How fast is the top of the ladder (which is initially 9 feet above the ground) sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 12 feet away from the wall? Use calculus to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder is 15 feet long, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 15^2\nx^2 + y^2 = 225\n\nWe are given that the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, so dx/dt = 2 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt when x = 12 feet.\n\nTo find dy/dt, we can differentiate both sides of the equation x^2 + y^2 = 225 with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(225)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt. When x = 12 feet, we can find the corresponding value of y from the equation x^2 + y^2 = 225:\n\n12^2 + y^2 = 225\n144 + y^2 = 225\ny^2 = 81\ny = 9\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the equation 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0:\n\n2(12)(2) + 2(9)(dy/dt) = 0\n48 + 18(dy/dt) = 0\n18(dy/dt) = -48\ndy/dt = -48/18\ndy/dt = -8/3\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 8/3 feet per second when the bottom of the ladder is 12 feet away from the wall."
