    "message_1": "What is the probability that the temperature in a certain region will exceed 90°F at least once during the month of August, given that historically the probability of a day having a temperature above 90°F is 0.25?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of the temperature exceeding 90°F at least once, we can find the probability of the temperature never exceeding 90°F during the month of August and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are 31 days in August. The probability of a day not having a temperature above 90°F is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\n\nThe probability of the temperature never exceeding 90°F during the entire month is the probability of it not happening on each day, which is 0.75^31 ≈ 0.0016.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability: the probability of the temperature exceeding 90°F at least once during the month of August is 1 - 0.0016 ≈ 0.9984, or 99.84%."
