    "message_1": "Suppose there are three bidders in a sealed-bid auction for a painting. Each bidder values the painting at a different amount: bidder 1 values it at $10,000, bidder 2 values it at $8,000, and bidder 3 values it at $6,000. The auction is a sealed-bid, second-price auction, meaning that the highest bidder wins the painting, but pays the second-highest bid (i.e. the price paid by the winner is the same as the second-highest bid).\n\nIf each bidder submits a bid that is equal to their true valuation of the painting, what will each bidder's payoff (i.e. profit or loss) be in this auction, and who will win the painting?",
    "message_2": "In this sealed-bid, second-price auction, each bidder submits a bid equal to their true valuation of the painting. The bids are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $10,000\nBidder 2: $8,000\nBidder 3: $6,000\n\nThe highest bidder is Bidder 1 with a bid of $10,000. However, since this is a second-price auction, Bidder 1 will pay the second-highest bid, which is $8,000 from Bidder 2. Therefore, Bidder 1 wins the painting and pays $8,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the payoffs for each bidder:\n\nBidder 1: The value of the painting for Bidder 1 is $10,000, and they pay $8,000 for it. Their payoff (profit) is the difference between the value and the price paid: $10,000 - $8,000 = $2,000.\n\nBidder 2: Since Bidder 2 does not win the painting, their payoff is $0.\n\nBidder 3: Similarly, Bidder 3 does not win the painting, so their payoff is also $0.\n\nIn summary, Bidder 1 wins the painting and has a payoff of $2,000, while Bidders 2 and 3 have payoffs of $0."
