    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 5x + 3, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = 2x² + 5x + 3\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)² - 4(2)(3))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √1) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-5 + 1) / 4 = -1\nx = (-5 - 1) / 4 = -1.5\n\nSo, the solutions of the quadratic equation are x = -1 and x = -1.5.\n\nTo represent the quadratic equation graphically, we can plot the equation y = 2x² + 5x + 3. The graph will be a parabola opening upwards since the coefficient of the x² term is positive. The vertex of the parabola can be found using the formula:\n\nVertex = (-b / 2a, f(-b / 2a))\n\nIn this case, the vertex is:\n\nVertex = (-5 / (2 * 2), f(-5 / (2 * 2)))\nVertex = (-5 / 4, f(-5 / 4))\nVertex = (-5 / 4, 2(-5 / 4)² + 5(-5 / 4) + 3)\nVertex = (-5 / 4, 2(6.25) - 6.25 + 3)\nVertex = (-5 / 4, 12.5 - 6.25 + 3)\nVertex = (-5 / 4, 9.25)\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-5 / 4, 9.25). The graph will have x-intercepts at x = -1 and x = -1.5, which are the solutions of the quadratic equation."
