    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 5cm. What is the area of the sector if its central angle is 60 degrees?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle, and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm, and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 5²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 25\n\nArea of sector = 25π/6\n\nTherefore, the area of the sector is 25π/6 square centimeters, or approximately 13.09 square centimeters."
