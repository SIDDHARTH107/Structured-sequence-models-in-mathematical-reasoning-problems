    "message_2": "To predict the sales for the next 3 months using time series analysis, we can use the moving average method. We will calculate the moving average for the last 12 months and use it to predict the sales for the next 3 months.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moving average for the last 12 months:\n\n(1400 + 1650 + 1550 + 1700 + 1850 + 1900 + 2100 + 2000 + 1900 + 2000 + 2150 + 2400) / 12 = 19650 / 12 = 1637.5\n\nNow, we can use this moving average to predict the sales for the next 3 months:\n\nJanuary (Month 37) prediction: 1637.5\nFebruary (Month 38) prediction: 1637.5\nMarch (Month 39) prediction: 1637.5\n\nUsing the moving average method, we predict that the sales for the next 3 months (January, February, and March) will be approximately 1637.5 units each month. Keep in mind that this is a simple prediction method and may not account for seasonal trends or other factors that could affect sales."
