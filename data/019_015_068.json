    "message_2": "In type theory, natural numbers are defined using the Peano axioms. The natural number 3 can be defined using the successor function S, which takes a natural number and returns the next natural number. The type-theoretic definition of the natural number 3 is:\n\n3 = S(S(S(0)))\n\nThis means that 3 is the successor of the successor of the successor of 0."
