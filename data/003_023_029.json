    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry, we first need to find the magnitudes of the vectors, the angle between them, and the unit normal vector.\n\n1. Magnitude of the vectors:\n$|\\vec{a}| = \\sqrt{5^2 + 3^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{38}$\n$|\\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{104}$\n\n2. Angle between the vectors:\nFirst, we find the dot product of the vectors:\n$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = (5)(-2) + (3)(6) + (-2)(8) = -10 + 18 - 16 = -8$\n\nNow, we use the dot product formula to find the angle between the vectors:\n$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}| |\\vec{b}| \\cos{\\theta}$\n$-8 = (\\sqrt{38})(\\sqrt{104})\\cos{\\theta}$\n\nSolving for $\\theta$:\n$\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{-8}{\\sqrt{38}\\sqrt{104}}$\n$\\theta = \\arccos{\\frac{-8}{\\sqrt{38}\\sqrt{104}}}$\n\n3. Unit normal vector:\nThe cross product of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ is orthogonal to both $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$. To find the unit normal vector, we can use the right-hand rule. The right-hand rule states that if you point your thumb in the direction of the first vector ($\\vec{a}$) and your index finger in the direction of the second vector ($\\vec{b}$), then your middle finger will point in the direction of the cross product.\n\nUsing the right-hand rule, we can determine that the unit normal vector is in the direction of $\\hat{k}$.\n\n4. Cross product:\nNow that we have the magnitudes of the vectors, the angle between them, and the unit normal vector, we can find the cross product:\n\n$\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}| |\\vec{b}| \\sin{\\theta} \\hat{n}$\n$\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = (\\sqrt{38})(\\sqrt{104})\\sin{\\arccos{\\frac{-8}{\\sqrt{38}\\sqrt{104}}}} \\hat{k}$\n\nThis expression represents the cross product of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ using trigonometry. However, it's important to note that this is not the most efficient way to compute the cross product. The standard method of computing the cross product using the determinant of a matrix is more straightforward and computationally simpler."
