    "message_2": "To triangulate a simple closed curve with the fewest number of triangles, we can start by considering the simplest closed curve, which is a triangle itself. In this case, the curve is already a triangle, and no further triangulation is needed. Therefore, the minimum number of triangles needed for this triangulation is 1."
