    "message_2": "An elliptic curve is defined by an equation of the form:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B\n\nWe need to find the values of A and B such that the curve passes through the points P(2, 5) and Q(3, 7). We can do this by plugging the coordinates of the points into the equation and solving for A and B.\n\nFor point P(2, 5):\n\n(5)^2 = (2)^3 + A(2) + B\n25 = 8 + 2A + B\n\nFor point Q(3, 7):\n\n(7)^2 = (3)^3 + A(3) + B\n49 = 27 + 3A + B\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, A and B:\n\n1) 2A + B = 17\n2) 3A + B = 22\n\nWe can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. Multiply equation 1 by -1 and add it to equation 2:\n\n-1 * (2A + B = 17) => -2A - B = -17\n\nNow add the two equations:\n\n(3A + B) + (-2A - B) = 22 + (-17)\nA = 5\n\nNow that we have the value of A, we can plug it back into either equation 1 or 2 to find the value of B. Let's use equation 1:\n\n2A + B = 17\n2(5) + B = 17\n10 + B = 17\nB = 7\n\nNow we have the values of A and B, so we can write the equation of the elliptic curve:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B\ny^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7"
