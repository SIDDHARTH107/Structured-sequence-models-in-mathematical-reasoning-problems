    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on its order and the properties of its elements.\n\nSince G is a group of order 4, there are 4 elements in G, say {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element. Now, let's consider the possible orders of the elements in G.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nIf G has an element of order 4, let's say a, then a^4 = e, and a, a^2, a^3, and a^4 = e are distinct elements of G. In this case, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, and G is a cyclic group generated by a. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 4.\nIf G has no element of order 4, then the maximum order of any element in G must be 2 (since the order of an element must divide the order of the group). We already know that the order of e is 1. Let the orders of a, b, and c be 2. Then, we have:\n\na^2 = e\nb^2 = e\nc^2 = e\n\nNow, let's consider the product ab. Since G is a group, ab must be an element of G. We know that ab cannot be equal to e, a, or b (otherwise, we would have a contradiction with the orders of a and b). Therefore, ab = c. Now, we can compute (ab)^2:\n\n(ab)^2 = (ab)(ab) = a(ba)b\n\nSince a^2 = b^2 = e, we can rewrite the above equation as:\n\na(ba)b = a(ab)b = a(c)b\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by a^(-1) and b^(-1) to get:\n\nba = cb\n\nSince b^2 = e, we can rewrite the above equation as:\n\nb(ab) = (bc)b\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by b^(-1) to get:\n\nab = bc\n\nSince ab = c, we have:\n\nc = bc\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by c^(-1) to get:\n\ne = b\n\nThis is a contradiction since we assumed that b is not equal to e. Therefore, G cannot have no element of order 4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must have an element of order 4, and thus G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4."
