    "message_1": "A certain technology has a 10% chance of failing within the first year of use. If a company purchases 50 of these technologies, what is the probability that less than 5 of them will fail within the first year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of technologies purchased), k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of failed technologies), p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a technology failing within the first year), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nSince we want to find the probability that less than 5 of the technologies will fail within the first year, we need to calculate the sum of the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 failures:\n\nP(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nWe can plug in the values for n, p, and k into the binomial probability formula and calculate the probabilities:\n\nn = 50 (number of technologies purchased)\np = 0.1 (probability of a technology failing within the first year)\n\nP(X = 0) = (50 choose 0) * 0.1^0 * (1-0.1)^(50-0)\nP(X = 1) = (50 choose 1) * 0.1^1 * (1-0.1)^(50-1)\nP(X = 2) = (50 choose 2) * 0.1^2 * (1-0.1)^(50-2)\nP(X = 3) = (50 choose 3) * 0.1^3 * (1-0.1)^(50-3)\nP(X = 4) = (50 choose 4) * 0.1^4 * (1-0.1)^(50-4)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 5) ≈ 0.0295 + 0.1454 + 0.2668 + 0.2817 + 0.2002\nP(X < 5) ≈ 0.9236\n\nSo, the probability that less than 5 of the 50 technologies will fail within the first year is approximately 92.36%."
