    "message_2": "To prove that A U A' = U, we need to show that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U.\n\nFirst, let's find the complement of set A with respect to the universal set U. The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nSince A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we can find A' as follows:\n\nA' = {5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nA U A' = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A or x ∈ A'}\n\nSince A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and A' = {5, 6}, we can find A U A' as follows:\n\nA U A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we can see that A U A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is equal to the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that A U A' = U using set theory."
