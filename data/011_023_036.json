    "message_2": "Let's use the graph theory to solve this problem. Since each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices, the degree of each vertex is 3. A planar graph with 7 vertices (V) and each vertex having a degree of 3 must have 10.5 edges (E), which is not possible as the number of edges must be an integer. \n\nHowever, we can still try to find the minimum number of colors required to color a graph with 7 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3, even though it's not planar.\n\nIn this case, we can use the greedy coloring algorithm. The greedy coloring algorithm states that the minimum number of colors required to color a graph is at most one more than the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph.\n\nSince the maximum degree of the vertices in this graph is 3, the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of this graph is at most 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nHowever, we can try to color the graph with 3 colors to see if it's possible. We can construct a graph with 7 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3 as follows:\n\n1. Create a cycle with 6 vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), where each vertex is connected to its adjacent vertices.\n2. Add the 7th vertex (7) and connect it to vertices 1, 3, and 5.\n\nNow, we can color the vertices as follows:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B.\n3. Color vertex 3 with color C.\n4. Color vertex 4 with color A.\n5. Color vertex 5 with color B.\n6. Color vertex 6 with color C.\n7. Color vertex 7 with color A.\n\nSince we can color the graph with 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, the minimum number of colors required is 3."
