    "message_1": "Sure, here's a possible numerical problem:\n\nIn the Beauty Contest Game, there are 10 players who have to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all players' numbers. However, the prize for winning is only given if no more than 3 players tie for the closest number, otherwise the prize is split equally among them.\n\nWhat number should you choose to maximize your chances of winning the prize (assuming all players use optimal strategies)?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning the prize, you should try to predict the average number chosen by all players and then choose 2/3 of that average. Since all players are using optimal strategies, they will also be trying to predict the average and choose 2/3 of that value.\n\nLet's start with the assumption that all players choose a number uniformly at random between 0 and 100. In this case, the average would be 50, and 2/3 of that average would be 33.33. However, since all players are using optimal strategies, they will also choose numbers around 33.33, which will lower the actual average.\n\nNow, let's assume that all players choose a number around 33.33. The new average would be lower, let's say around 25, and 2/3 of that average would be 16.67. Again, since all players are using optimal strategies, they will choose numbers around 16.67, which will further lower the average.\n\nThis process of iteratively updating the predicted average and choosing 2/3 of that value will eventually converge to a stable value. In this case, the stable value is close to 0, as the average will keep getting lower with each iteration.\n\nSo, to maximize your chances of winning the prize, you should choose a number close to 0. However, since the prize is only given if no more than 3 players tie for the closest number, you might want to choose a slightly higher number (e.g., 1 or 2) to avoid a tie with other players who also choose 0."
