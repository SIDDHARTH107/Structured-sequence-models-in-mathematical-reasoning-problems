    "message_2": "To solve for x, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 8 to both sides of the equation.\n5x - 8 + 8 = 22 + 8\n\nStep 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.\n5x = 30\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 5.\n5x / 5 = 30 / 5\n\nStep 4: Simplify both sides of the equation.\nx = 6\n\nSo, the solution is x = 6."
