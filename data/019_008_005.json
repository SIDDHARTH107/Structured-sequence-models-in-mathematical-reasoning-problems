A widget with a weight of 2 ounces is a member of the fuzzy set A with a membership grade of 0.8, a member of the fuzzy set B with a membership grade of 0.4, and a member of the fuzzy set C with a membership grade of 0.1. What is the total membership grade of the widget across all three sets?",
    "message_2": "To find the total membership grade of the widget across all three sets, we simply add the membership grades for each set.\n\nTotal membership grade = Membership grade in A + Membership grade in B + Membership grade in C\n\nTotal membership grade = 0.8 (A) + 0.4 (B) + 0.1 (C)\n\nTotal membership grade = 0.8 + 0.4 + 0.1\n\nTotal membership grade = 1.3"
