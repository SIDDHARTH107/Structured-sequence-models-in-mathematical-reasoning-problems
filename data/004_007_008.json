    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (2x + 1)^(4x+2) using the chain rule, we need to first identify the outer function and the inner function. In this case, the outer function is g(u) = u^(4x+2) and the inner function is h(x) = 2x + 1. \n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\ng'(u) = (4x + 2)u^(4x+1)\nh'(x) = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\n\nf'(x) = (4x + 2)(2x + 1)^(4x+1) * 2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x + 1)^(4x+2) is:\n\nf'(x) = 2(4x + 2)(2x + 1)^(4x+1)"
