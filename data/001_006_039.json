    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b / 2a. In this case, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -3.\n\nx = -4 / (2 * 2) = -4 / 4 = -1\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1) - 3 = 2(1) - 4 - 3 = 2 - 4 - 3 = -5\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (-1, -5).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, and its equation is x = -1.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we can set x = 0 in the equation:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 + 4(0) - 3 = 0 + 0 - 3 = -3\n\nSo, the y-intercept of the quadratic equation is (0, -3).\n\nIn summary, the vertex is (-1, -5), the axis of symmetry is x = -1, and the y-intercept is (0, -3)."
