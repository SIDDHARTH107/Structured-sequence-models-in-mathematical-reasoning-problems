    "message_1": "A control system has a transfer function of H(s)=s^3/(s^3+3s^2+2s+1). Use the Fourier transform to find the frequency response of the system at a frequency of 6 Hz.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we need to evaluate the transfer function H(s) at s = jω, where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit. The frequency response is given by H(jω).\n\nGiven frequency f = 6 Hz, we can find the angular frequency ω as follows:\n\nω = 2 * π * f = 2 * π * 6 = 12π rad/s\n\nNow, we substitute s = jω in the transfer function H(s):\n\nH(jω) = H(j12π) = (j12π)^3 / ((j12π)^3 + 3(j12π)^2 + 2(j12π) + 1)\n\nLet's evaluate the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator: (j12π)^3 = (j^3)(12π)^3 = (-j)(12π)^3 = -j(12π)^3\n\nDenominator: (j12π)^3 + 3(j12π)^2 + 2(j12π) + 1\n= (-j(12π)^3) + 3(-1(12π)^2) + 2(j12π) + 1\n= -j(12π)^3 - 3(12π)^2 + 2j(12π) + 1\n\nNow, we can find the frequency response H(jω):\n\nH(j12π) = -j(12π)^3 / (-j(12π)^3 - 3(12π)^2 + 2j(12π) + 1)\n\nTo find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response, we can convert this complex number to polar form. Let's first find the magnitude:\n\n|H(j12π)| = sqrt(Real^2 + Imaginary^2)\n= sqrt((-3(12π)^2 + 1)^2 + ((12π)^3 - 2(12π))^2)\n\nAnd the phase:\n\n∠H(j12π) = arctan(Imaginary / Real)\n= arctan(((12π)^3 - 2(12π)) / (-3(12π)^2 + 1))\n\nNow, you can plug these values into a calculator to find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response at 6 Hz."
