    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a given point, we need to find the derivative of the equation with respect to x, which represents the slope of the curve at any point.\n\nThe given equation is y = 2x^2 + 3x + 1.\n\nLet's find the derivative dy/dx:\n\n(dy/dx) = d(2x^2 + 3x + 1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule and sum rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n(dy/dx) = 2 * d(x^2)/dx + 3 * d(x)/dx + d(1)/dx\n\n(dy/dx) = 2 * (2x) + 3 * (1) + 0\n(dy/dx) = 4x + 3\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point where x = 2. Plug x = 2 into the derivative:\n\n(dy/dx) = 4(2) + 3\n(dy/dx) = 8 + 3\n(dy/dx) = 11\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 11."
