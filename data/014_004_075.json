    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob using elliptic curve cryptography. She chooses the curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the field F_19 and the point P(5,4) on the curve as her public key. Alice encrypts her message as M = (2,3) using Bob's public key Q = 3P. Determine the ciphertext that Alice sends to Bob.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the point Q = 3P. To do this, we will perform point doubling and point addition on the elliptic curve E over F_19.\n\n1. Calculate 2P:\nTo find 2P, we use the point doubling formula:\nλ = (3x^2 + a) / 2y (mod p)\nν = λ^2 - 2x (mod p)\n\nFor P(5,4), a = 2, and p = 19:\nλ = (3 * 5^2 + 2) / (2 * 4) (mod 19)\nλ = (75 + 2) / 8 (mod 19)\nλ = 77 / 8 (mod 19)\nλ = 77 * 8^(-1) (mod 19)\nλ = 77 * 12 (mod 19) (since 8^(-1) = 12 (mod 19))\nλ = 924 (mod 19)\nλ = 9\n\nν = 9^2 - 2 * 5 (mod 19)\nν = 81 - 10 (mod 19)\nν = 71 (mod 19)\nν = 14\n\nSo, 2P = (14, 9).\n\n2. Calculate 3P = P + 2P:\nTo find 3P, we use the point addition formula:\nλ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) (mod p)\nν = λ^2 - x1 - x2 (mod p)\n\nFor P(5,4) and 2P(14,9), p = 19:\nλ = (9 - 4) / (14 - 5) (mod 19)\nλ = 5 / 9 (mod 19)\nλ = 5 * 9^(-1) (mod 19)\nλ = 5 * 17 (mod 19) (since 9^(-1) = 17 (mod 19))\nλ = 85 (mod 19)\nλ = 9\n\nν = 9^2 - 5 - 14 (mod 19)\nν = 81 - 19 (mod 19)\nν = 62 (mod 19)\nν = 5\n\nSo, 3P = (5, 5), which is Bob's public key Q.\n\n3. Encrypt the message M = (2,3) using Q = (5,5):\nTo encrypt the message, we use the ElGamal encryption scheme on the elliptic curve. We choose a random integer k (1 < k < 19) and compute two points C1 and C2 as follows:\nC1 = kP\nC2 = M + kQ\n\nLet's choose k = 3 (you can choose any other value between 1 and 18, but the result will be different):\nC1 = 3P = (5, 5)\n\nC2 = M + 3Q:\nFirst, calculate 3Q = 3(5, 5) = 3P (since Q = 3P):\n3Q = (5, 5)\n\nNow, calculate C2 = M + 3Q:\nM = (2, 3)\n3Q = (5, 5)\n\nλ = (5 - 3) / (5 - 2) (mod 19)\nλ = 2 / 3 (mod 19)\nλ = 2 * 3^(-1) (mod 19)\nλ = 2 * 13 (mod 19) (since 3^(-1) = 13 (mod 19))\nλ = 26 (mod 19)\nλ = 7\n\nν = 7^2 - 2 - 5 (mod 19)\nν = 49 - 7 (mod 19)\nν = 42 (mod 19)\nν = 4\n\nSo, C2 = (4, 4).\n\nThe ciphertext that Alice sends to Bob is the pair of points (C1, C2) = ((5, 5), (4, 4))."
