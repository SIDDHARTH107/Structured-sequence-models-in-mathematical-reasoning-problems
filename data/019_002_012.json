    "message_2": "To show that the statement is true for x = 2k, where k is some integer, we need to prove that if x is even (i.e., x = 2k), then x^2 is also even.\n\nLet x be an even integer, which means x can be written as x = 2k, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the square of x:\n\nx^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)\n\nSince 2k^2 is an integer (as the product of two integers), let's denote it as m, where m = 2k^2.\n\nNow, x^2 = 2m, where m is an integer.\n\nBy definition, a number is even if it can be written as the product of 2 and some integer. In this case, x^2 can be written as the product of 2 and the integer m, so x^2 is even.\n\nThus, we have shown that if x is even (x = 2k), then x^2 is also even. The statement is true for x = 2k, where k is some integer."
