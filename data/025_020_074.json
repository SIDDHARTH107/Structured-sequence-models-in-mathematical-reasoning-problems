    "message_1": "Let $X$ be a Calabi-Yau variety of dimension 3. If $H^{1,1}(X) = 2$ and $H^{2,1}(X) = 10$, what is the Hodge number $h^{2,2}(X)$?",
    "message_2": "For a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$, the Hodge diamond is given by:\n\n```\n  1\n  0 h^{1,0}\nh^{0,1} h^{2,0}\n  0 h^{1,1} h^{3,0}\nh^{0,2} h^{2,1} h^{1,2}\n  0 h^{1,1} h^{2,2}\nh^{0,3} h^{2,0}\n  0 h^{1,0}\n  1\n```\n\nSince $X$ is a Calabi-Yau variety, it has trivial canonical bundle, which implies that $h^{1,0}(X) = h^{2,0}(X) = h^{3,0}(X) = 0$. Also, we have $h^{0,1}(X) = h^{1,0}(X)$, $h^{0,2}(X) = h^{2,0}(X)$, and $h^{0,3}(X) = h^{3,0}(X)$, so these values are also 0.\n\nWe are given that $H^{1,1}(X) = 2$ and $H^{2,1}(X) = 10$. By the symmetry of the Hodge diamond, we have $h^{1,2}(X) = h^{2,1}(X) = 10$ and $h^{2,2}(X) = h^{1,1}(X) = 2$.\n\nSo, the Hodge number $h^{2,2}(X) = 2$."
