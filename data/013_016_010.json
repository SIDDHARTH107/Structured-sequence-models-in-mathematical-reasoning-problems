    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve regarding moral hazard in game theory:\n\nSuppose a principal-agent relationship in which an owner hires a manager to run a company. The owner can choose to provide a certain level of incentive payment to the manager, represented by the variable x. If the manager exerts high effort, the company will earn a profit of $500,000. If the manager exerts low effort, the profit will only be $100,000. However, the manager's effort level is not observable by the owner, so the manager has an incentive to exert low effort to maximize their personal benefit. Suppose the manager's reservation utility (and thus their outside option) is $200,000. \n\nIf the owner chooses an incentive payment of $125,000, what effort level will the manager choose to maximize their expected utility?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effort level the manager will choose, we need to compare the utility they receive from exerting high effort and low effort, given the incentive payment of $125,000.\n\nLet's denote the utility from high effort as U_high and the utility from low effort as U_low.\n\nIf the manager exerts high effort, the company earns a profit of $500,000, and the manager receives the incentive payment of $125,000. So, U_high = $125,000.\n\nIf the manager exerts low effort, the company earns a profit of $100,000. Since the owner cannot observe the manager's effort level, the manager still receives the incentive payment of $125,000. So, U_low = $125,000.\n\nNow, we compare the utilities:\n\nU_high = $125,000\nU_low = $125,000\n\nSince U_high = U_low, the manager is indifferent between exerting high effort and low effort. However, given that the manager's reservation utility is $200,000, both options provide less utility than their outside option. In this case, the manager would likely choose not to work for the owner at all, as their expected utility from both effort levels is less than their reservation utility."
