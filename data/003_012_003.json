    "message_1": "A ship is traveling towards a lighthouse. The angle of elevation of the top of the lighthouse from the ship is 25 degrees. After the ship traveled 2 kilometers towards the lighthouse, the angle of elevation is now 32 degrees. What is the distance between the ship and the lighthouse?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the ship and the lighthouse as x, and the height of the lighthouse as h. We can use the tangent function to set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1) tan(25°) = h / x\n2) tan(32°) = h / (x - 2)\n\nNow, we can solve the first equation for h:\n\nh = x * tan(25°)\n\nSubstitute this expression for h into the second equation:\n\ntan(32°) = (x * tan(25°)) / (x - 2)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx * tan(32°) = x * tan(25°) - 2 * tan(25°) * tan(32°)\n\nx * (tan(32°) - tan(25°)) = 2 * tan(25°) * tan(32°)\n\nx = 2 * tan(25°) * tan(32°) / (tan(32°) - tan(25°))\n\nUsing a calculator to find the tangent values:\n\nx ≈ 2 * 0.4663 * 0.6249 / (0.6249 - 0.4663)\nx ≈ 1.2446 / 0.1586\nx ≈ 7.843\n\nTherefore, the distance between the ship and the lighthouse is approximately 7.843 kilometers."
