    "message_2": "In a relevance logic system, the implication A → B is considered relevant if and only if A is relevant to B. Given that A implies B (A → B) and A is relevant to C, we cannot directly conclude that B is relevant to C without further information.\n\nHowever, if we know that there is a relevant implication between A and C (A → C) and between B and C (B → C), then we can say that B is relevant to C. Otherwise, the relevance of B to C remains undetermined based on the given information."
