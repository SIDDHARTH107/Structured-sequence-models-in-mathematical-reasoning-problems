    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the two curves y=x^2 and y=x^3 over the interval x=0 to x=1, we need to find the difference between the two functions and integrate that difference over the given interval.\n\nThe difference between the two functions is:\n\ny = x^3 - x^2\n\nNow, we will integrate this difference over the interval x=0 to x=1:\n\n∫(x^3 - x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nTo integrate, we will use the power rule, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1):\n\n∫(x^3 - x^2) dx = (x^4)/4 - (x^3)/3 + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\n[((1^4)/4 - (1^3)/3) - ((0^4)/4 - (0^3)/3)]\n\n= [(1/4 - 1/3)]\n\nTo find a common denominator, we will use 12:\n\n= [(3 - 4)/12]\n\n= -1/12\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we will take the absolute value of the result:\n\nArea = |-1/12| = 1/12\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the two curves y=x^2 and y=x^3 over the interval x=0 to x=1 is 1/12."
