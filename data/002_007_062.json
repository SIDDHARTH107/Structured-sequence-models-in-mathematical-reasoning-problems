    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm, a base of 5 cm, and a top length of 7 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 8 cm, the top length (or top base) is 7 cm, and the bottom base is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (7 + 5) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (12) * 8\nArea = 6 * 8\nArea = 48 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 48 square centimeters."
