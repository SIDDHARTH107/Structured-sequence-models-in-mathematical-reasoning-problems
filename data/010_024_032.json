    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than 180 degrees. To find the value of x, we can use the formula for the sum of angles in a hyperbolic triangle:\n\nSum of angles = 180 - A\n\nwhere A is the area of the triangle in hyperbolic geometry. However, we don't have enough information to find the area of the triangle. Therefore, we can't find the exact value of x, but we can determine that it must be less than 50 degrees, since 60 + 70 + x < 180."
