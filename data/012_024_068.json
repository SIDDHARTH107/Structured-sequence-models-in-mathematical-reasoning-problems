    "message_2": "First, let's find the number of edges (E) and vertices (V) in the complete graph K6.\n\nA complete graph K6 has 6 vertices, so V = 6.\n\nIn a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, for each vertex, there are (6 - 1) = 5 edges connected to it. Since there are 6 vertices, the total number of edges would be 6 * 5 = 30. However, we have counted each edge twice (once for each vertex it connects), so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of edges: E = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nNow, we can use the formula G = (E - 3V + 6)/12 to find the genus of the graph:\n\nG = (15 - 3 * 6 + 6) / 12\nG = (15 - 18 + 6) / 12\nG = (3) / 12\nG = 1/4\n\nSince the genus of a graph must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer to get the minimum genus required for the graph:\n\nG = 1\n\nSo, the genus of the complete graph K6 is 1."
