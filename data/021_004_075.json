    "message_2": "To find the numerical derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2 using the forward difference method with a step size of h = 0.1 at x = 1, we can use the numerical differentiation formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nFirst, let's find the value of the function at x = 1 and x = 1 + h:\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) - 2 = 1 - 4 + 5 - 2 = 0\nf(1 + h) = f(1.1) = (1.1)^3 - 4(1.1)^2 + 5(1.1) - 2 ≈ 1.331 - 4.84 + 5.5 - 2 = 0.001\n\nNow, we can use the numerical differentiation formula to find f'(1):\n\nf'(1) ≈ (f(1 + h) - f(1)) / h = (0.001 - 0) / 0.1 = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01\n\nSo, the approximate value of f'(1) using the forward difference method with a step size of h = 0.1 is 0.01."
