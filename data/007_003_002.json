    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 456789 is divided by 7 using modular arithmetic, we can break down the number into smaller parts and find the remainder of each part when divided by 7. Then, we can add the remainders and find the remainder of the sum when divided by 7.\n\n456789 can be written as:\n(4 * 10^5) + (5 * 10^4) + (6 * 10^3) + (7 * 10^2) + (8 * 10^1) + 9\n\nNow, we find the remainder of each part when divided by 7:\n(4 * 10^5) % 7 = (4 * (10^5 % 7)) % 7 = (4 * 2) % 7 = 8 % 7 = 1\n(5 * 10^4) % 7 = (5 * (10^4 % 7)) % 7 = (5 * 4) % 7 = 20 % 7 = 6\n(6 * 10^3) % 7 = (6 * (10^3 % 7)) % 7 = (6 * 1) % 7 = 6 % 7 = 6\n(7 * 10^2) % 7 = (7 * (10^2 % 7)) % 7 = (7 * 2) % 7 = 14 % 7 = 0\n(8 * 10^1) % 7 = (8 * (10^1 % 7)) % 7 = (8 * 3) % 7 = 24 % 7 = 3\n9 % 7 = 2\n\nNow, we add the remainders and find the remainder of the sum when divided by 7:\n(1 + 6 + 6 + 0 + 3 + 2) % 7 = 18 % 7 = 4\n\nSo, the remainder when 456789 is divided by 7 is 4."
