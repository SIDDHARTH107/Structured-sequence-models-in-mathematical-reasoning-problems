    "message_2": "To find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle, we can use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible cycles and choose the one with the minimum total weight. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at vertex A.\n2. Visit each unvisited vertex connected to the current vertex, and recursively apply the algorithm.\n3. If all vertices are visited and the current vertex is connected to the starting vertex (A), update the minimum total weight if the current cycle's weight is less than the current minimum.\n4. Backtrack and try other possibilities.\n\nApplying the algorithm, we get the following possible Hamiltonian cycles and their total weights:\n\n1. A → B → E → D → C → A (6 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 5 = 32)\n2. A → B → D → E → C → A (6 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 5 = 30)\n3. A → C → D → B → E → A (5 + 9 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 34)\n4. A → C → D → E → B → A (5 + 9 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 30)\n5. A → C → B → E → D → A (5 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 32)\n6. A → C → B → D → E → A (5 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 8 = 29)\n7. A → D → C → B → E → A (8 + 9 + 6 + 7 + 5 = 35)\n8. A → D → E → B → C → A (8 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 9 = 35)\n\nThe shortest Hamiltonian cycle is A → C → B → D → E → A with a total weight of 29."
