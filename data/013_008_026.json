    "message_1": "In a public goods game, there are 10 players, each with an initial endowment of $100. They are given the choice to either keep their money or contribute to a group project. Each dollar contributed to the project is doubled and divided equally among all players, regardless of whether they contributed or not. If every player contributes their entire endowment to the project, what will be each player's final payoff?",
    "message_2": "If every player contributes their entire endowment of $100 to the group project, the total contribution will be 10 players * $100/player = $1000.\n\nSince each dollar contributed is doubled, the total amount after doubling will be $1000 * 2 = $2000.\n\nThis doubled amount is then divided equally among all 10 players, regardless of their contribution. So, each player's final payoff will be $2000 / 10 players = $200 per player."
