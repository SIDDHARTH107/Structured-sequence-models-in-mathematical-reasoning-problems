    "message_2": "The given quadratic equation is already in the vertex form, which is y = a(x-h)^2 + k. In this form, the vertex of the parabola is given by the point (h, k).\n\nFor the equation y = 3(x-2)^2 + 5, we can see that:\n\na = 3\nh = 2\nk = 5\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (2, 5)."
