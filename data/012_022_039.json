    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a complete subgraph with m vertices or an independent set (an empty subgraph) with n vertices.\n\nFor R(4,4), we are looking for the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a complete subgraph with 4 vertices (K4) or an independent set with 4 vertices.\n\nThe exact value of R(4,4) is known to be 18. This means that in any graph with 18 vertices, there must be either a complete subgraph with 4 vertices or an independent set with 4 vertices."
