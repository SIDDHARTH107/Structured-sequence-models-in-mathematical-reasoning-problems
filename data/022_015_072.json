    "message_2": "To determine the function $f(z)$ using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first define a function $g(z)$ that is analytic in the lower half-plane, $\\operatorname{Im}(z) < 0$, and has a continuous extension to the real axis such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We can define $g(z)$ as the complex conjugate of $f(\\bar{z})$, i.e., $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$.\n\nNow, we define a new function $h(z)$ as follows:\n$$\nh(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z), & \\text{if } \\operatorname{Im}(z) > 0, \\\\\ng(z), & \\text{if } \\operatorname{Im}(z) < 0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are continuous on the real axis and $f(x) = g(x)$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $h(z)$ is continuous on the real axis. Moreover, $h(z)$ is analytic in both the upper and lower half-planes. By the Schwarz reflection principle, $h(z)$ must be an entire function, i.e., analytic in the whole complex plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $F(z) = z(h(z) - 1)$. From the given conditions, we have\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} F(Re^{i\\theta}) = 0,\n$$\nfor all $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$. Since $F(z)$ is an entire function, by the Riemann's theorem on removable singularities, $F(z)$ must be identically zero in the upper half-plane. Similarly, we can show that $F(z)$ is identically zero in the lower half-plane. Therefore, $F(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, which implies that $h(z) = 1$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nFinally, we have $f(z) = h(z) = 1$ for all $z$ in the upper half-plane, and this is the unique function that satisfies the given conditions."
