    "message_1": "A company produces two products, Product A and Product B, with a profit of 10 and 15 dollars per unit, respectively. The production process requires raw materials and labor, and the company has 1000 units of raw material available and can hire up to 200 hours of labor. The production of one unit of Product A requires 2 units of raw material and 10 hours of labor, while the production of one unit of Product B requires 3 units of raw material and 15 hours of labor. Using the firefly algorithm for optimization, what is the maximum profit that the company can achieve?",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. However, since we cannot actually apply the firefly algorithm here, we will solve the problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit): P = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material constraint: 2x + 3y <= 1000\n2. Labor constraint: 10x + 15y <= 200 * 60 (converting hours to minutes)\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x >= 0, y >= 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y = 1000 -> y = (1000 - 2x) / 3\n2. 10x + 15y = 200 * 60 -> y = (200 * 60 - 10x) / 15\n\nIntersection points:\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and x-axis (y = 0): 2x = 1000 -> x = 500\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and y-axis (x = 0): 3y = 1000 -> y = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.33\n3. Intersection of constraint 2 and x-axis (y = 0): 10x = 200 * 60 -> x = 120\n4. Intersection of constraint 2 and y-axis (x = 0): 15y = 200 * 60 -> y = 800 / 3 ≈ 266.67\n5. Intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2: 2x + 3y = 1000 and 10x + 15y = 200 * 60\n   Solving the system of equations, we get x = 80 and y = 240\n\nFeasible region vertices:\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (500, 0)\n3. (0, 333.33)\n4. (80, 240)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10 * 0 + 15 * 0 = 0\n2. P(500, 0) = 10 * 500 + 15 * 0 = 5000\n3. P(0, 333.33) = 10 * 0 + 15 * 333.33 ≈ 5000\n4. P(80, 240) = 10 * 80 + 15 * 240 = 800 + 3600 = 4400\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at vertex 2 with 500 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of 5000 dollars."
