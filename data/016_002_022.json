    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a Koch snowflake curve of level 4, we first need to understand the process of constructing a Koch snowflake. \n\nStarting with an equilateral triangle, each iteration (or level) involves replacing the middle third of each line segment with two segments of equal length, forming an equilateral triangle without its base. This process is repeated for each new segment created.\n\nFor each level, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is divided by 3. \n\nLet's calculate the perimeter of a level 4 Koch snowflake:\n\n1. Original equilateral triangle (level 0): 3 sides, each with a length of 8 cm.\n2. Level 1: 3 * 4 = 12 segments, each with a length of 8/3 cm.\n3. Level 2: 12 * 4 = 48 segments, each with a length of (8/3)/3 = 8/9 cm.\n4. Level 3: 48 * 4 = 192 segments, each with a length of (8/9)/3 = 8/27 cm.\n5. Level 4: 192 * 4 = 768 segments, each with a length of (8/27)/3 = 8/81 cm.\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the level 4 Koch snowflake:\n\nPerimeter = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\nPerimeter = 768 * (8/81)\nPerimeter = 6144/81\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 75.85 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of a Koch snowflake curve of level 4 with each side of the original equilateral triangle having a length of 8 cm is approximately 75.85 cm."
