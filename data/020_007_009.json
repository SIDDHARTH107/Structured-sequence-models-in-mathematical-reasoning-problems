Each employee can work on at most one project per day. The productivity of each employee varies based on the project they are assigned to, and the company wants to maximize total productivity across all projects. The productivity of each employee on each project is given in the table below:\n\n|          | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 | Project 5 |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Employee 1  | 2         | 7         | 6         | 8         | 5          |\n| Employee 2  | 3         | 4         | 5         | 9         | 1          |\n| Employee 3  | 4         | 6         | 8         | 2         | 7          |\n| Employee 4  | 8         | 3         | 7         | 4         | 5          |\n| Employee 5  | 2         | 3         | 1         | 7         | 6          |\n| Employee 6  | 5         | 9         | 4         | 2         | 8          |\n| Employee 7  | 1         | 2         | 5         | 6         | 7          |\n| Employee 8  | 5         | 4         | 3         | 1         | 9          |\n| Employee 9  | 6         | 7         | 2         | 4         | 8          |\n| Employee 10 | 9         | 1         | 3         | 5         | 7          |\n\nWhat is the maximum total productivity that can be achieved by assigning employees to projects? And, what is the assignment of employees to projects that achieves this maximum productivity?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Hungarian Algorithm, which is an efficient method for solving assignment problems. The algorithm will help us find the optimal assignment of employees to projects that maximizes the total productivity.\n\nFirst, we need to create a cost matrix by subtracting each element in the productivity matrix from the maximum value in the matrix. In this case, the maximum value is 9.\n\nCost matrix:\n\n|          | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 | Project 5 |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Employee 1  | 7         | 2         | 3         | 1         | 4          |\n| Employee 2  | 6         | 5         | 4         | 0         | 8          |\n| Employee 3  | 5         | 3         | 1         | 7         | 2          |\n| Employee 4  | 1         | 6         | 2         | 5         | 4          |\n| Employee 5  | 7         | 6         | 8         | 2         | 3          |\n| Employee 6  | 4         | 0         | 5         | 7         | 1          |\n| Employee 7  | 8         | 7         | 4         | 3         | 2          |\n| Employee 8  | 4         | 5         | 6         | 8         | 0          |\n| Employee 9  | 3         | 2         | 7         | 5         | 1          |\n| Employee 10 | 0         | 8         | 6         | 4         | 2          |\n\nNow, we can apply the Hungarian Algorithm to the cost matrix to find the optimal assignment of employees to projects. After applying the algorithm, we get the following assignment:\n\n- Employee 1: Project 4\n- Employee 2: Project 1\n- Employee 3: Project 3\n- Employee 4: Project 5\n- Employee 5: Project 2\n- Employee 6: Project 2\n- Employee 7: Project 5\n- Employee 8: Project 5\n- Employee 9: Project 1\n- Employee 10: Project 1\n\nNow, we can calculate the total productivity for this assignment by summing the productivity values from the original matrix for the assigned projects:\n\nTotal productivity = 8 (E1-P4) + 3 (E2-P1) + 8 (E3-P3) + 5 (E4-P5) + 3 (E5-P2) + 9 (E6-P2) + 7 (E7-P5) + 9 (E8-P5) + 6 (E9-P1) + 9 (E10-P1) = 67\n\nSo, the maximum total productivity that can be achieved by assigning employees to projects is 67. The assignment of employees to projects that achieves this maximum productivity is as follows:\n\n- Employee 1: Project 4\n- Employee 2: Project 1\n- Employee 3: Project 3\n- Employee 4: Project 5\n- Employee 5: Project 2\n- Employee 6: Project 2\n- Employee 7: Project 5\n- Employee 8: Project 5\n- Employee 9: Project 1\n- Employee 10: Project 1"
