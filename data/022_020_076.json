    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using complex analysis, we first find the general solution to the homogeneous differential equation:\n\nu'' + 4u = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = ±2i\n\nThe general solution to the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\nu(x) = A*cos(2x) + B*sin(2x)\n\nNow, we apply the given boundary conditions:\n\nu(0) = 0 => A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = 0 => A = 0\n\nSo, the solution becomes:\n\nu(x) = B*sin(2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of u(x):\n\nu'(x) = 2B*cos(2x)\n\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n\nu'(π/2) = 3 => 2B*cos(π) = 3 => B = -3/2\n\nSo, the final solution is:\n\nu(x) = -3/2*sin(2x)\n\nNow, we can find the value of u(x) at x = π/4:\n\nu(π/4) = -3/2*sin(2*(π/4)) = -3/2*sin(π/2) = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the value of u(x) at x = π/4 is -3/2."
