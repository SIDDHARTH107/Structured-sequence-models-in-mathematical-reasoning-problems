We are left with:\n\n-2x1 + 2x2 = 0\n\nSolving for x2, we get x2 = x1. Let x1 = 1, then x2 = 1. So, the eigenvector v1 = [1, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 2:\n\n(A - 2I)v2 = 0\n[[4 - 2, 2], [2, 4 - 2]]v2 = [[2, 2], [2, 2]]v2 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\n2x1 + 2x2 = 0\n2x1 + 2x2 = 0\n\nThese equations are linearly dependent, so we can remove one of them. We are left with:\n\n2x1 + 2x2 = 0\n\nSolving for x2, we get x2 = -x1. Let x1 = 1, then x2 = -1. So, the eigenvector v2 = [1, -1].\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues of matrix A are λ1 = 6 and λ2 = 2, with corresponding eigenvectors v1 = [1, 1] and v2 = [1, -1]."
