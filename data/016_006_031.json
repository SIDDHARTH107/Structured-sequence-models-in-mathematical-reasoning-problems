    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is constructed using four affine transformations with the following scaling ratios:\n\n1. Scaling ratio for the first transformation (stem): 0.01\n2. Scaling ratio for the second transformation (successively smaller leaflets): 0.85\n3. Scaling ratio for the third transformation (largest left-hand leaflet): 0.20\n4. Scaling ratio for the fourth transformation (largest right-hand leaflet): -0.15\n\nThese scaling ratios are used with different probabilities to generate the fractal shape of the Barnsley fern."
