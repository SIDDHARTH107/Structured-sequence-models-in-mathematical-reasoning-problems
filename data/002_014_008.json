    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, left, right, front, and back.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces is length × width:\nArea_top_bottom = 5 cm × 3 cm = 15 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (top and bottom), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_top_bottom = 2 × 15 cm² = 30 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces is height × width:\nArea_left_right = 10 cm × 3 cm = 30 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (left and right), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_left_right = 2 × 30 cm² = 60 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces is length × height:\nArea_front_back = 5 cm × 10 cm = 50 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (front and back), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_front_back = 2 × 50 cm² = 100 cm²\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all the faces together:\nSurface_area = Total_area_top_bottom + Total_area_left_right + Total_area_front_back\nSurface_area = 30 cm² + 60 cm² + 100 cm² = 190 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 190 cm²."
