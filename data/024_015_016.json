    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\alpha$, we need to take the partial derivatives of the components of $\\alpha$ with respect to the coordinates $x$ and $y$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form is given by:\n\n$$d\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_x}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_y}{\\partial y}\\right) dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_x$ and $\\alpha_y$ are the components of the 1-form $\\alpha$. In our case, we have:\n\n$$\\alpha_x = x^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha_y = xy^2$$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (x^2)}{\\partial x} = 2x$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial (xy^2)}{\\partial y} = 2xy$$\n\nPlugging these into the formula for $d\\alpha$, we get:\n\n$$d\\alpha = (2x - 2xy) dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate $d\\alpha$ at the point $(1,2)$. Plugging in the coordinates, we get:\n\n$$d\\alpha(1,2) = (2(1) - 2(1)(2)) dx \\wedge dy = (-2) dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative $d\\alpha$ evaluated at the point $(1,2)$ is $-2 dx \\wedge dy$."
