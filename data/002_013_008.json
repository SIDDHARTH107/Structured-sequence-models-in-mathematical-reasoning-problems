    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nGiven the dimensions of the pyramid are length = 7 cm, width = 5 cm, and height = 9 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 7 * 5 * 9\nVolume = (1/3) * 315\nVolume = 105 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 105 cubic centimeters."
