    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 18, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 18: 18 = 2 × 3^2.\n2. Identify the possible structures of groups of order 18 based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 9 (3^2), and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_2 = 3, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 2, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can only be 1. This means there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\n3. Determine the possible group structures based on the Sylow subgroups.\n\nSince there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, we can form a semi-direct product with the Sylow 2-subgroup. If the Sylow 2-subgroup is also normal (n_2 = 1), then the group is a direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. This gives us the group structure Z_2 × Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_18.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal (n_2 = 3), we can still form a semi-direct product with the Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, there are two possible actions of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup, which correspond to the two non-trivial automorphisms of the Sylow 3-subgroup. One of these actions results in the dihedral group D_18, while the other action results in a non-abelian group of order 18 that is not isomorphic to D_18.\n\n4. Count the distinct isomorphism classes.\n\nWe have found three distinct group structures: Z_18, D_18, and the non-abelian group of order 18 that is not isomorphic to D_18. Therefore, there are 3 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 18."
