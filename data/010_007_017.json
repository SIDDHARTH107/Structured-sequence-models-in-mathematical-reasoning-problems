    "message_2": "1) To calculate the fundamental group of X with basepoint a, we first need to understand the structure of X. The space X is formed by attaching two circles (A and B) to a disk (D) along their boundaries. The basepoint a is located on the boundary of the disk D.\n\nWe can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem to compute the fundamental group of X. The theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets U and V such that their intersection U ∩ V is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X is given by the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i_U(γ) * i_V(γ)^(-1), where γ is a loop in U ∩ V, and i_U and i_V are the inclusion maps of U ∩ V into U and V, respectively.\n\nLet's choose U to be the disk D with a small open neighborhood around its boundary, and V to be the union of the two circles A and B with a small open neighborhood around their boundaries. Then, U ∩ V is a small open neighborhood around the boundary of D, which is path-connected.\n\nThe fundamental group of U is trivial, as U is contractible (being a disk). The fundamental group of V is the free group on two generators, as V is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of two circles. Let's denote these generators by a and b, corresponding to the loops around circles A and B, respectively.\n\nSince the intersection U ∩ V is contractible, any loop in U ∩ V is null-homotopic in both U and V. Therefore, the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i_U(γ) * i_V(γ)^(-1) is trivial, and the fundamental group of X is the free group on two generators:\n\nπ_1(X, a) = <a, b>\n\n2) To find all covering spaces of X up to isomorphism, we can use the correspondence between covering spaces and subgroups of the fundamental group of X. Since the fundamental group of X is the free group on two generators, its subgroups are also free groups with various ranks.\n\nLet's consider the cases:\n\na) Trivial subgroup: This corresponds to the universal cover of X, which is the infinite tree with 4 edges emanating from each vertex. This tree is the Cayley graph of the free group on two generators.\n\nb) Subgroups of rank 1: These correspond to the cyclic covers of X. For each integer n, there is a cyclic cover of X with n-fold symmetry, obtained by taking the quotient of the universal cover by the action of the cyclic group of order n.\n\nc) Subgroups of rank 2: These correspond to the regular covers of X. For each pair of integers (m, n), there is a regular cover of X with m-fold symmetry around circle A and n-fold symmetry around circle B. This cover can be obtained by taking the quotient of the universal cover by the action of the free group on two generators, where the generators act as rotations by 2π/m and 2π/n, respectively.\n\nd) Subgroups of higher rank: These correspond to more complicated covering spaces of X, which can be obtained by taking quotients of the universal cover by the action of various subgroups of the free group on two generators. However, these covering spaces are not very informative, as they do not have a simple geometric interpretation.\n\nIn summary, the covering spaces of X up to isomorphism are given by the universal cover (the infinite tree), the cyclic covers with n-fold symmetry, and the regular covers with m-fold symmetry around circle A and n-fold symmetry around circle B."
