    "message_2": "To find the total number of triangles in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid construction, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of triangles = (3^(iteration number - 1))\n\nIn this case, the iteration number is 5. So, we have:\n\nTotal number of triangles = (3^(5 - 1))\n\nTotal number of triangles = (3^4)\n\nTotal number of triangles = 81\n\nSo, there are 81 triangles in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid construction."
