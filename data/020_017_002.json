    "message_1": "A metal sheet measuring 12 meters by 10 meters needs to be cut into rectangular pieces of equal area such that each piece has the least possible perimeter. What is the area of each rectangular piece?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the perimeter of the rectangular pieces, we should try to make the sides of the rectangles as close to each other as possible. Since the metal sheet has an area of 12 meters * 10 meters = 120 square meters, we should look for factors of 120 that are close to each other.\n\nThe factors of 120 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. The pair of factors that are closest to each other are 10 and 12.\n\nSo, we can cut the metal sheet into rectangular pieces of dimensions 10 meters by 12 meters. The area of each rectangular piece is 10 meters * 12 meters = 120 square meters."
