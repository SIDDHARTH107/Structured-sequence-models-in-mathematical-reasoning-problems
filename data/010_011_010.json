    "message_2": "To find a chart (U, φ) at P, we need to define a smooth map φ: M ∩ U → ℝ² such that φ is a diffeomorphism. We can use the stereographic projection to define this map.\n\nLet's define the map φ: M ∩ U → ℝ² as follows:\n\nφ(x, y, z) = (u, v) = (y/(1 - x), z/(1 - x))\n\nThe inverse map φ⁻¹: ℝ² → M ∩ U is given by:\n\nφ⁻¹(u, v) = (x, y, z) = ((u² + v² - 1) / (u² + v² + 1), 2u / (u² + v² + 1), 2v / (u² + v² + 1))\n\nNow, we need to check that φ and φ⁻¹ are smooth and that their Jacobians are invertible.\n\nThe map φ is smooth since it is a rational function of x, y, and z with a non-vanishing denominator (1 - x ≠ 0 for points on M). Similarly, φ⁻¹ is smooth since it is a rational function of u and v with a non-vanishing denominator (u² + v² + 1 ≠ 0).\n\nNow let's compute the Jacobian of φ:\n\nJφ = | ∂(u, v) / ∂(x, y, z) | = | ∂u/∂x  ∂u/∂y  ∂u/∂z | = |  y/(1 - x)²   -(1 - x)⁻¹   0      |\n                                     | ∂v/∂x  ∂v/∂y  ∂v/∂z |   |  z/(1 - x)²    0      -(1 - x)⁻¹ |\n\nAt the point P = (1, 0, 0), we have:\n\nJφ(P) = |  0  -1  0 |\n            |  0   0 -1 |\n\nThe determinant of Jφ(P) is non-zero, so Jφ(P) is invertible.\n\nNow let's compute the Jacobian of φ⁻¹:\n\nJφ⁻¹ = | ∂(x, y, z) / ∂(u, v) | = | ∂x/∂u  ∂x/∂v | = | 2u(u² + v² - 1) / (u² + v² + 1)²   2v(u² + v² - 1) / (u² + v² + 1)² |\n                                     | ∂y/∂u  ∂y/∂v |   | 2(u² + v² + 1)⁻¹ - 4u² / (u² + v² + 1)²   -4uv / (u² + v² + 1)²       |\n                                     | ∂z/∂u  ∂z/∂v |   | -4uv / (u² + v² + 1)²                       2(u² + v² + 1)⁻¹ - 4v² / (u² + v² + 1)² |\n\nAt the point φ(P) = (0, 0), we have:\n\nJφ⁻¹(0, 0) = |  0   0 |\n                 |  2   0 |\n                 |  0   2 |\n\nThe determinant of Jφ⁻¹(0, 0) is non-zero, so Jφ⁻¹(0, 0) is invertible.\n\nSince φ and φ⁻¹ are smooth and their Jacobians are invertible, φ is a diffeomorphism between M ∩ U and an open subset of ℝ². Thus, we have found a chart (U, φ) at P with φ(P) = (0, 0)."
