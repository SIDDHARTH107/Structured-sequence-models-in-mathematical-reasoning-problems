    "message_2": "To find the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the given graph, we need to identify the largest set of vertices where each vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n\nThe given graph has the following edges:\n\n- AB, AC, AD\n- BC, BD\n- DE\n\nLet's examine the connections:\n\n1. A is connected to B, C, and D.\n2. B is connected to A, C, and D.\n3. C is connected to A, B, and D.\n4. D is connected to A, B, C, and E.\n5. E is connected to D.\n\nFrom the connections, we can see that vertices A, B, C, and D form a complete subgraph, as each vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set. There is no larger complete subgraph in this graph.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of the given graph is 4."
