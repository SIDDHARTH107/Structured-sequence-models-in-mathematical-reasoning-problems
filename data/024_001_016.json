    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we need to compute the first and second derivatives of the vector function r(t) and then use the formulas for curvature and torsion.\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of r(t):\n\nr(t) = (cos t)i + (sin t)j + 2t k\n\nr'(t) = (-sin t)i + (cos t)j + 2 k\nr''(t) = (-cos t)i + (-sin t)j\n\nNow, let's evaluate r'(t) and r''(t) at t = π/2:\n\nr'(π/2) = (-sin(π/2))i + (cos(π/2))j + 2 k = -i + 0j + 2k = -i + 2k\nr''(π/2) = (-cos(π/2))i + (-sin(π/2))j = 0i - j = -j\n\nNext, we will find the curvature (kappa) using the formula:\n\nkappa = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product r'(t) x r''(t):\n\nr'(π/2) x r''(π/2) = (-i + 2k) x (-j) = -2i - k\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of r'(t) and r'(t) x r''(t):\n\n||r'(π/2)|| = sqrt((-1)^2 + (2)^2) = sqrt(5)\n||r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)|| = sqrt((-2)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(5)\n\nNow we can find the curvature:\n\nkappa = ||r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)|| / ||r'(π/2)||^3 = (sqrt(5)) / (sqrt(5))^3 = 1/5\n\nFinally, we will find the torsion (tau) using the formula:\n\ntau = (r'(t) x r''(t) • r'''(t)) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the third derivative r'''(t):\n\nr'''(t) = (sin t)i + (-cos t)j\n\nNow, let's evaluate r'''(t) at t = π/2:\n\nr'''(π/2) = (sin(π/2))i + (-cos(π/2))j = i\n\nNow, let's find the dot product (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t):\n\n(-2i - k) • i = -2\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude squared of r'(t) x r''(t):\n\n||r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)||^2 = (sqrt(5))^2 = 5\n\nNow we can find the torsion:\n\ntau = (r'(π/2) x r''(π/2) • r'''(π/2)) / ||r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)||^2 = -2 / 5\n\nSo, the curvature and torsion of the space curve at t = π/2 are:\n\nkappa = 1/5\ntau = -2/5"
