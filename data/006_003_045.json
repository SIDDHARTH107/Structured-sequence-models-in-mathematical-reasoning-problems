    "message_2": "There is only 1 ace of spades in a standard deck of 52 playing cards. So, the probability of drawing the ace of spades is 1 out of 52.\n\nThe probability can be written as a fraction:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 1/52"
