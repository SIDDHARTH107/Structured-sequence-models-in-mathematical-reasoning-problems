    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle with radius 5 cm. The area of the base (A_base) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (5 cm)^2\nA_base = 25π cm^2\n\nThe lateral surface area of the cone (A_lateral) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nA_lateral = π * (5 cm) * (13 cm)\nA_lateral = 65π cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area (A_total) by adding the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π cm^2 + 65π cm^2\nA_total = 90π cm^2\n\nTo find the numerical value correct to two decimal places, we can substitute the value of π (approximately 3.14):\n\nA_total ≈ 90 * 3.14 cm^2\nA_total ≈ 282.6 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the right circular cone is approximately 282.6 cm^2, correct to two decimal places."
