    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 2x + 1, we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-i * k * x)] dx, where the integral is taken over the interval of x from -1 to 1.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 2x + 1, so we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[(2x + 1) * e^(-i * k * x)] dx, with the integral taken from x = -1 to x = 1.\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(k) = ∫[2x * e^(-i * k * x)] dx + ∫[e^(-i * k * x)] dx, with both integrals taken from x = -1 to x = 1.\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n\n∫[2x * e^(-i * k * x)] dx = (2/i*k) * e^(-i * k * x) | evaluated from x = -1 to x = 1\n\n= (2/i*k) * (e^(-i * k) - e^(i * k))\n\nNow, let's solve the second integral:\n\n∫[e^(-i * k * x)] dx = (-1/i*k) * e^(-i * k * x) | evaluated from x = -1 to x = 1\n\n= (-1/i*k) * (e^(-i * k) - e^(i * k))\n\nNow, we can combine the two results:\n\nF(k) = (2/i*k) * (e^(-i * k) - e^(i * k)) + (-1/i*k) * (e^(-i * k) - e^(i * k))\n\nF(k) = (1/i*k) * (e^(-i * k) - e^(i * k))\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 2x + 1 for x between -1 and 1."
