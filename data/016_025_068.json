The second stage has three triangles. The third stage has nine triangles, and so on. Can you find a formula for the number of triangles in the nth stage?",
    "message_2": "Yes, I can help you find a formula for the number of triangles in the nth stage of the Sierpinski sieve. \n\nLet's denote the number of triangles at the nth stage as T(n). We can see that the pattern of the number of triangles is increasing by a factor of 3 at each stage:\n\nT(1) = 1\nT(2) = 3\nT(3) = 9\nT(4) = 27\n...\n\nThis pattern suggests that the number of triangles at the nth stage is given by the formula:\n\nT(n) = 3^(n-1)\n\nwhere n is the stage number, and ^ denotes exponentiation."
