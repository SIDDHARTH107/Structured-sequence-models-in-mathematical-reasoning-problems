    "message_1": "A 20 Newton force pulls a crate 5 meters along a flat surface. Find the work done by the force, assuming no friction acts on the crate.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nwhere Work is the work done, Force is the applied force, Distance is the distance the object is moved, and θ is the angle between the force and the direction of motion.\n\nIn this case, the force is 20 Newtons, the distance is 5 meters, and since the force is pulling the crate along the flat surface, the angle θ is 0 degrees. The cosine of 0 degrees is 1.\n\nSo, the work done is:\n\nWork = 20 N × 5 m × cos(0°)\nWork = 20 N × 5 m × 1\nWork = 100 Joules\n\nThe work done by the force is 100 Joules."
