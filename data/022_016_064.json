    "message_1": "Here's a possible question based on the Riemann mapping theorem:\n\nSuppose you have a simply connected open set $U$ in the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$ that contains the origin $0$, and you want to find a conformal map $f: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{D}$ where $\\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disk centered at $0$. \n\n(a) Find the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ around $0$, and state the radius of convergence of this series. \n\n(b) Use the first two terms of the Laurent series to estimate the value of $f(z)$ at $z=0.1$, and compare it with the exact value computed by a numerical method. \n\n(c) Use the Riemann mapping theorem to show that there exists a unique conformal map $f$ as above, up to a rotation and a scaling.",
    "message_2": "(a) Since $f$ is a conformal map from $U$ to the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$, it is holomorphic on $U$. Therefore, we can expand $f(z)$ as a power series around $0$ (not a Laurent series, as Laurent series are used for functions with singularities). The power series expansion of $f(z)$ around $0$ is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + a_3 z^3 + \\cdots$$\n\nThe radius of convergence of this power series is determined by the distance from the origin to the boundary of $U$. Let $R$ be the infimum of the distances from the origin to the boundary of $U$. Then the radius of convergence of the power series is $R$.\n\n(b) To estimate the value of $f(z)$ at $z=0.1$, we can use the first two terms of the power series:\n\n$$f(0.1) \\approx a_0 + a_1 (0.1)$$\n\nTo compare this with the exact value computed by a numerical method, we would need to know the coefficients $a_0$ and $a_1$, which depend on the specific conformal map $f$. If we had these coefficients, we could compute the exact value of $f(0.1)$ and compare it with the approximation.\n\n(c) The Riemann mapping theorem states that there exists a unique conformal map from a simply connected open set $U$ to the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$, up to a rotation and a scaling. To show this, let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be two conformal maps from $U$ to $\\mathbb{D}$. Then $f_2^{-1} \\circ f_1$ is a conformal map from $\\mathbb{D}$ to itself, fixing the origin. By the Schwarz lemma, $f_2^{-1} \\circ f_1$ must be a rotation. Therefore, $f_1$ and $f_2$ differ by a rotation, and the conformal map is unique up to a rotation and a scaling."
