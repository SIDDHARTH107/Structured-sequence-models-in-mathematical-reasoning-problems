    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x-5) + log2(x+1) = 3, we can first use the logarithm property that states log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog2((x-5)(x+1)) = 3\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that log_a(b) = c is equivalent to a^c = b. In this case, we have:\n\n2^3 = (x-5)(x+1)\n\n8 = x^2 - 4x - 5\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 5 - 8 = 0\n\nx^2 - 4x - 13 = 0\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(-13))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 52)) / 2\n\nx = (4 ± √68) / 2\n\nThe two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = (4 + √68) / 2\nx = (4 - √68) / 2\n\nThese are the two solutions for x in the given equation."
