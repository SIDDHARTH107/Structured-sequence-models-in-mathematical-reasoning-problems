    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x) = e^(-x²/2), we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[ψ(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx, where the integral is taken from -∞ to ∞.\n\nIn this case, ψ(x) = e^(-x²/2), so we have:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[e^(-x²/2) * e^(-ikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[e^(-x²/2 - ikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we will complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-x²/2 - ikx = -(x² + 2ikx)/2\n\nNow, we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of the linear term (ik) inside the exponent:\n\n-(x² + 2ikx + (ik)² - (ik)²)/2 = -((x + ik)² - (ik)²)/2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[e^{-((x + ik)² - (ik)²)/2}] dx, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nLet's make a substitution: u = x + ik. Then, du = dx, and the limits of integration remain the same:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[e^{-(u² - (ik)²)/2}] du, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nNow, we can separate the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[e^{-u²/2} * e^{(ik)²/2}] du, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nThe second exponential does not depend on u, so we can take it out of the integral:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) * e^{(ik)²/2} * ∫[e^{-u²/2}] du, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nThe remaining integral is the Gaussian integral, which is equal to the square root of 2π:\n\n∫[e^{-u²/2}] du = √(2π), from -∞ to ∞.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x) = e^(-x²/2) is:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) * e^{(ik)²/2} * √(2π) = e^{-(k²)/2}.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of ψ(x) = e^(-x²/2) is F(k) = e^{-(k²)/2}."
