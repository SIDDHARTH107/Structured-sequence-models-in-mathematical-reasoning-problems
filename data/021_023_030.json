    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is an iterative process that involves a population of candidate solutions (wolves) searching for the best solution (the alpha) in the search space. To solve this problem using GWO, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of wolves with random values for x, y, and z within the constraints.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf using the function f(x, y, z).\n3. Identify the alpha, beta, and delta wolves (the top three wolves with the best fitness).\n4. Update the position of each wolf based on the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.\n6. The alpha wolf's position represents the optimal solution.\n\nDue to the iterative and random nature of the GWO algorithm, providing an exact numerical solution is not possible. However, you can implement the GWO algorithm in a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or R to find an approximate solution to the problem.\n\nKeep in mind that the GWO algorithm is just one of many optimization algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Other optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, or Simulated Annealing could also be used to find the maximum value of the function f(x, y, z) under the given constraints."
