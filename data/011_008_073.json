    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to partition a set of 6 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets, so we are looking for S(6, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(6, 3), we need to calculate the Stirling numbers for smaller values of n and k first. We can build a table to help us with this:\n\nn\\k | 1   2   3   4   5   6\n---------------------------\n1   | 1   0   0   0   0   0\n2   | 1   1   0   0   0   0\n3   | 1   3   1   0   0   0\n4   | 1   7   6   1   0   0\n5   | 1  15  25  10   1   0\n6   | 1  31  90  65  15   1\n\nUsing the formula, we can fill in the table:\n\nS(3, 3) = 3 * S(2, 3) + S(2, 2) = 3 * 0 + 1 = 1\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 ways to partition a set of 6 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
