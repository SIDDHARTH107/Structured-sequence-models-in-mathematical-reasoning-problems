    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A x B, denoted as (A x B)'.\n\nTo find the complement of a set, we need to know the universal set U. Since it is not given, we cannot find the exact complement of A x B. However, we can still proceed with finding A' x B' and check if the distributive property holds.\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B'. Again, we need the universal set U to find the exact complements. However, we can still denote them as A' and B' without knowing the exact elements.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product A' x B'. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a', b') where a' is in A' and b' is in B'.\n\nA' x B' = {(a', b') | a' ∈ A', b' ∈ B'}\n\nNow, we need to verify if the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over complement. In other words, we need to check if (A x B)' = A' x B'. \n\nSince we don't know the exact elements of A', B', and (A x B)', we cannot directly compare the sets. However, we can see that the elements of A x B are ordered pairs with elements from A and B, while the elements of A' x B' are ordered pairs with elements from A' and B'. Since A and A' are disjoint (i.e., they have no elements in common), and similarly for B and B', the elements of A x B and A' x B' will also be disjoint. Therefore, (A x B)' and A' x B' cannot be equal.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
