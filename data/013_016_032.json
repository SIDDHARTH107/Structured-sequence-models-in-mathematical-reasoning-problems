    "message_1": "Consider two players A and B participating in a game where A can invest either $50 or $100 while B can invest either $75 or $125. The outcome of the game is such that A's investment is multiplied by 2 if B invests $125 and not multiplied if B invests $75. Similarly, B's investment is multiplied by 2 if A invests $100 and not multiplied if A invests $50. However, the players face a moral hazard problem, which means there is a probability of 0.5 that the player who invested less will not fulfill their part of the contract. If both players invest the same amount, the payoffs are as follows: $(A,B)=(50,75)$ gives $(60,80)$; $(A,B)=(50,125)$ gives $(0,150)$; $(A,B)=(100,75)$ gives $(0,150)$; and $(A,B)=(100,125)$ gives $(120,140)$. What investment combination should A choose to maximize their expected payoff assuming that B is rational?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal investment combination for A, we need to calculate the expected payoffs for each possible combination of investments, considering the moral hazard problem.\n\n1. If A invests $50 and B invests $75:\n- With probability 0.5, both players fulfill their part of the contract, and the payoffs are (60, 80).\n- With probability 0.5, B does not fulfill their part of the contract, and the payoffs are (50, 0).\nThe expected payoffs for A in this case are: 0.5 * 60 + 0.5 * 50 = 30 + 25 = 55.\n\n2. If A invests $50 and B invests $125:\n- With probability 0.5, both players fulfill their part of the contract, and the payoffs are (0, 150).\n- With probability 0.5, A does not fulfill their part of the contract, and the payoffs are (0, 125).\nThe expected payoffs for A in this case are: 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.\n\n3. If A invests $100 and B invests $75:\n- With probability 0.5, both players fulfill their part of the contract, and the payoffs are (0, 150).\n- With probability 0.5, B does not fulfill their part of the contract, and the payoffs are (100, 0).\nThe expected payoffs for A in this case are: 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 100 = 0 + 50 = 50.\n\n4. If A invests $100 and B invests $125:\n- With probability 0.5, both players fulfill their part of the contract, and the payoffs are (120, 140).\n- With probability 0.5, A does not fulfill their part of the contract, and the payoffs are (0, 125).\nThe expected payoffs for A in this case are: 0.5 * 120 + 0.5 * 0 = 60 + 0 = 60.\n\nComparing the expected payoffs for A in each case, we find that the highest expected payoff for A is 60, which occurs when A invests $100 and B invests $125. Therefore, A should choose to invest $100, assuming that B is rational."
