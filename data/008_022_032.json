    "message_2": "First, let's find the determinant of the matrix of coefficients. The matrix of coefficients is:\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n      | 3  4  7 |\n      | 6  8 13 |\n\nTo find the determinant, we can use the formula:\n\ndet(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i are the elements of the matrix:\n\na = 1, b = 2, c = 3\nd = 3, e = 4, f = 7\ng = 6, h = 8, i = 13\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\ndet(A) = 1(4*13 - 7*8) - 2(3*13 - 7*6) + 3(3*8 - 4*6)\ndet(A) = 1(52 - 56) - 2(39 - 42) + 3(24 - 24)\ndet(A) = 1(-4) - 2(-3) + 3(0)\ndet(A) = -4 + 6 + 0\ndet(A) = 2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero (det(A) = 2), the matrix is not singular, and the system of linear equations has a unique solution. Now, let's find the solution using Cramer's rule.\n\nCramer's rule states that the solution to a system of linear equations can be found by dividing the determinant of a matrix with the coefficients of the variables replaced by the constants by the determinant of the matrix of coefficients.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinants of the matrices with the coefficients of the variables replaced by the constants:\n\nDx = | 6  2  3 |\n         |16  4  7 |\n         |28  8 13 |\n\nDy = | 1  6  3 |\n         | 3 16  7 |\n         | 6 28 13 |\n\nDz = | 1  2  6 |\n         | 3  4 16 |\n         | 6  8 28 |\n\nNow, let's find the determinants of these matrices:\n\ndet(Dx) = 6(4*13 - 7*8) - 2(16*13 - 7*28) + 3(16*8 - 4*28)\ndet(Dx) = 6(52 - 56) - 2(208 - 196) + 3(128 - 112)\ndet(Dx) = 6(-4) - 2(12) + 3(16)\ndet(Dx) = -24 - 24 + 48\ndet(Dx) = 0\n\ndet(Dy) = 1(16*13 - 7*28) - 6(3*13 - 7*6) + 3(3*28 - 4*16)\ndet(Dy) = 1(208 - 196) - 6(39 - 42) + 3(84 - 64)\ndet(Dy) = 1(12) - 6(-3) + 3(20)\ndet(Dy) = 12 + 18 + 60\ndet(Dy) = 90\n\ndet(Dz) = 1(3*28 - 4*16) - 2(3*8 - 4*6) + 6(3*4 - 4*3)\ndet(Dz) = 1(84 - 64) - 2(24 - 24) + 6(12 - 12)\ndet(Dz) = 1(20) - 2(0) + 6(0)\ndet(Dz) = 20\n\nNow, we can find the solution using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = det(Dx) / det(A) = 0 / 2 = 0\ny = det(Dy) / det(A) = 90 / 2 = 45\nz = det(Dz) / det(A) = 20 / 2 = 10\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 45, and z = 10.\n\nNow, let's check if the matrix of coefficients is ill-conditioned. A matrix is considered ill-conditioned if its condition number is large. The condition number can be calculated as the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. However, calculating the condition number can be computationally expensive, and a simpler way to check if a matrix is ill-conditioned is to compare the determinant with the product of the diagonal elements.\n\nIn this case, the determinant is 2, and the product of the diagonal elements is 1 * 4 * 13 = 52. Since the determinant is much smaller than the product of the diagonal elements, the matrix might be ill-conditioned.\n\nAn ill-conditioned matrix means that the system of linear equations is sensitive to small changes in the coefficients or the constants. In other words, a small change in the input values can lead to a large change in the solution. This can cause numerical instability and inaccurate results when solving the system using numerical methods. However, since we used Cramer's rule, which is an exact method, our solution is accurate."
