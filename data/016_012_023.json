    "message_2": "To find the length of the Peano curve of order 4, we can use the given formula:\n\n$L_n = \\frac{4}{3}L_{n-1}$\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the Peano curve for orders 2 and 3.\n\nFor order 2:\n$L_2 = \\frac{4}{3}L_1 = \\frac{4}{3}(2) = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\nFor order 3:\n$L_3 = \\frac{4}{3}L_2 = \\frac{4}{3}(\\frac{8}{3}) = \\frac{32}{9}$\n\nNow, we can find the length for order 4:\n$L_4 = \\frac{4}{3}L_3 = \\frac{4}{3}(\\frac{32}{9}) = \\frac{128}{27}$\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve of order 4 is $\\frac{128}{27}$."
