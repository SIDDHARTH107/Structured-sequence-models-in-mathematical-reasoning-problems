    "message_1": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, two travelers are caught with identical antique vases at customs. The penalty for having these vases is a fine equal to the value of the lower-valued vase. Each traveler is asked to make a claim for the value of their vase without knowing the other's claim. If both travelers claim the same value, they will be charged that amount. If one claims a lower value than the other, the one who claimed the higher value will be charged the value they claimed, and the one who claimed the lower value will be charged the same value plus an additional $10.\n\nNow, suppose the actual value of the vase is $110. What should each traveler claim to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible outcomes for each traveler based on their claims. We'll call the travelers A and B.\n\n1. If both travelers claim $110, they will both be charged $110.\n2. If traveler A claims $110 and traveler B claims $100, traveler A will be charged $110, and traveler B will be charged $100 + $10 = $110.\n3. If traveler A claims $100 and traveler B claims $110, traveler A will be charged $100 + $10 = $110, and traveler B will be charged $110.\n4. If both travelers claim $100, they will both be charged $100.\n\nIn all scenarios, both travelers end up paying $110, except for the case where they both claim $100, in which they both pay $100. Therefore, to maximize their profit, each traveler should claim $100. This way, they minimize the fine they have to pay, which is $10 less than the actual value of the vase."
