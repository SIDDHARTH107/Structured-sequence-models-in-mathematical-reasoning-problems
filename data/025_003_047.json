    "message_2": "To determine the singular points of V, we first compute the partial derivatives of the defining polynomial with respect to each variable:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2\n\nA point (x, y, z) is singular if and only if all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously at that point. In this case, we have:\n\n3x^2 = 0\n3y^2 = 0\n3z^2 = 0\n\nSince we are working in the projective space, we cannot have x = y = z = 0 simultaneously. Therefore, there are no singular points on the variety V.\n\nNow, let's find the tangent space to V at a general point [x:y:z]. The tangent space is defined by the linear equations given by the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x (x - x_0) + ∂f/∂y (y - y_0) + ∂f/∂z (z - z_0) = 0\n\nPlugging in the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n3x^2 (x - x_0) + 3y^2 (y - y_0) + 3z^2 (z - z_0) = 0\n\nSince there are no singular points, the tangent space is well-defined at every point on V."
