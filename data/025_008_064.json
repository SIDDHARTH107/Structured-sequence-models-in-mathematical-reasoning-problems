    "message_2": "To find the number of real points on the curve, we need to analyze the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1$. Let's first find the critical points of the function $f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1$ by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:\n\n$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2 = 0$\n\nNow, we solve for $x$:\n\n$3x^2 = 2$\n\n$x^2 = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$\n\nNow, we have two critical points: $x_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$ and $x_2 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$. Let's analyze the behavior of the function around these points.\n\nFor $x < -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$, the function $f(x)$ is decreasing, and for $-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} < x < \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$, the function is increasing. Finally, for $x > \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$, the function is decreasing again.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum and maximum values of the function in these intervals:\n\n$f(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}) = -\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n$f(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}) = -\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSince the minimum value of the function is $-\\frac{1}{3}$, we know that there will be real points on the curve for $y^2 \\geq -\\frac{1}{3}$. Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, we have real points on the curve for all $y^2 \\geq 0$.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum value of the function:\n\nSince the function is increasing in the interval $-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} < x < \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$, the maximum value will be at the right endpoint:\n\n$f(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}) = -\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSince the maximum value of the function is $-\\frac{1}{3}$, we know that there will be no real points on the curve for $y^2 < -\\frac{1}{3}$. However, this is not possible since $y^2$ is always non-negative.\n\nTherefore, there are real points on the curve for all $y^2 \\geq 0$. Since there are two branches of the curve (one for positive $y$ and one for negative $y$), there are infinitely many real points on the curve."
