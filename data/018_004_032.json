    "message_2": "The complement of set B with respect to set A, denoted as A\\B or A - B, is the set of all elements in A that are not in B.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB = {2, 3, 6}\n\nA\\B = {1, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's prove that this complement is unique. \n\nProof by contradiction:\n\nAssume there exists another set C such that C is also the complement of B with respect to A, and C is not equal to A\\B.\n\nSince C is the complement of B with respect to A, it must contain all elements in A that are not in B. Therefore, C must also contain elements {1, 4, 5}.\n\nNow, if C is not equal to A\\B, then there must exist at least one element in C that is not in A\\B or vice versa. However, this would contradict the fact that C contains all elements in A that are not in B, as A\\B already contains all such elements.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists another set C that is the complement of B with respect to A and is not equal to A\\B is false. This proves that the complement of set B with respect to set A, A\\B, is unique."
