    "message_2": "A simplicial complex with three vertices and three edges forms a triangle. In this case, the simplicial complex has the following faces:\n\n1. Three 0-dimensional faces (the vertices): {A}, {B}, {C}\n2. Three 1-dimensional faces (the edges): {A, B}, {B, C}, {C, A}\n3. One 2-dimensional face (the triangle itself): {A, B, C}\n\nSo, the simplicial complex has a total of 7 faces."
