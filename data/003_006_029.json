    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle as follows: Let A be the vertex with the 30° angle, B be the vertex with the 60° angle, and C be the vertex with the unknown angle. Let a be the side opposite angle A, b be the side opposite angle B, and c be the side opposite angle C. We are given that c = 7, angle A = 30°, and angle B = 60°.\n\nFirst, we need to find angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we have:\n\nangle C = 180° - (angle A + angle B) = 180° - (30° + 60°) = 180° - 90° = 90°\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the lengths of the other two sides:\n\nThe law of sines states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is the same for all three sides of a triangle:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe can use this to find the length of side a:\n\na / sin(30°) = c / sin(90°)\n\nWe know that c = 7 and sin(30°) = 1/2, sin(90°) = 1:\n\na / (1/2) = 7 / 1\n\na = 7 * (1/2) = 7/2 = 3.5\n\nNow we can find the length of side b:\n\nb / sin(60°) = c / sin(90°)\n\nWe know that c = 7 and sin(60°) = √3/2, sin(90°) = 1:\n\nb / (√3/2) = 7 / 1\n\nb = 7 * (√3/2) = (7√3)/2\n\nSo, the length of the other two sides are a = 3.5 and b = (7√3)/2."
