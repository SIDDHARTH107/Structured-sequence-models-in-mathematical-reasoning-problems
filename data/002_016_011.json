    "message_1": "An equilateral triangle has an area of 25 square centimeters. What is the length of each side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of each side of the equilateral triangle, we can use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:\n\nArea = (s^2 * √3) / 4\n\nWhere s is the length of a side of the triangle. We are given the area as 25 square centimeters, so we can set up the equation:\n\n25 = (s^2 * √3) / 4\n\nNow, we need to solve for s:\n\n25 * 4 = s^2 * √3\n100 = s^2 * √3\ns^2 = 100 / √3\ns^2 ≈ 57.74\ns ≈ √57.74\ns ≈ 7.6\n\nSo, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is approximately 7.6 centimeters."
