    "message_2": "Since G has order 9, by the Sylow theorems, there must exist a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say H, of order 3^2 = 9. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian\nIf G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, since there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup (up to isomorphism) of order 9, which is C9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian\nSuppose G is non-abelian. Then, there must exist elements a, b in G such that ab ≠ ba. Let's analyze the structure of G in this case.\n\nSince |G| = 9, by the class equation, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nwhere Z(G) is the center of G, C(x) is the centralizer of x in G, and the sum runs over one representative x from each conjugacy class of G not in the center.\n\nSince G is non-abelian, |Z(G)| < |G|. The possible orders of Z(G) are 1 and 3 (since it must divide |G|). If |Z(G)| = 3, then Z(G) is a normal subgroup of G, and G/Z(G) would be a group of order 3, which is abelian. But this would imply that G is abelian, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, |Z(G)| = 1, which means Z(G) = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let x be an element of G not in the center. Then, |C(x)| must divide |G|, so |C(x)| = 3 or 9. If |C(x)| = 9, then x is in the center, which is a contradiction. Therefore, |C(x)| = 3 for all x not in the center.\n\nThe class equation now becomes:\n\n9 = 1 + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nSince |G:C(x)| = 3 for all x not in the center, the sum must have two terms, which means there are two conjugacy classes of size 3 outside the center. Let x and y be representatives of these two classes, and let H = ⟨x⟩ and K = ⟨y⟩ be the cyclic subgroups generated by x and y, respectively. Then, |H| = |K| = 3.\n\nNow, consider the element xy. Since x and y are not in the center, xy ≠ yx. Thus, xy cannot be in H or K. Also, (xy)^2 = xyxy ≠ x^2y^2, so xy is not the identity element. Therefore, xy has order 3, and G has another subgroup of order 3, say L = ⟨xy⟩.\n\nSince G has three distinct subgroups of order 3 (H, K, and L), and any two elements from different subgroups do not commute, G must have a non-abelian structure.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 (in the abelian case) or has a non-abelian structure with three distinct subgroups of order 3 (in the non-abelian case)."
