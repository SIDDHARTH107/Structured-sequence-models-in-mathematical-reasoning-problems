    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to one of the following groups - C12, A4, or D6, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let's first find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 12, we have the prime factorization 12 = 2^2 * 3^1. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can only be 1.\n\nNow, let P_2 and P_3 be 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups of G, respectively. Since n_3 = 1, P_3 is a normal subgroup of G. The order of P_3 is 3, so it is isomorphic to C3 (the cyclic group of order 3). \n\nIf n_2 = 1, then P_2 is also a normal subgroup of G, and the order of P_2 is 4, so it is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). In this case, G is the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, which are both normal subgroups. If P_2 is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to C12. If P_2 is isomorphic to V4, then G is isomorphic to the external direct product of V4 and C3, which is isomorphic to A4.\n\nIf n_2 = 3, then there are three 2-Sylow subgroups, and they are all conjugate to each other. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to C12, as C12 has a unique subgroup of order 4. Since G has a normal 3-Sylow subgroup, it must act on the set of 2-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all 2-Sylow subgroups, which has order 2. The image of this homomorphism is a subgroup of S3, which has order 6. Since the order of the kernel times the order of the image equals the order of G, the image must be the entire S3. Thus, G is an extension of S3 by a group of order 2, which is isomorphic to D6.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C12, A4, or D6.\n\nNow, if G is isomorphic to A4, we want to find the element (123) in G. In this case, G is the alternating group on 4 elements, which consists of even permutations of the symmetric group S4. The element (123) is a 3-cycle, which is an even permutation, so it is an element of A4."
