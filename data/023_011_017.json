    "message_2": "1. Find the Fourier transform of the signal f(t).\n\nThe Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFor the given signal f(t) = cos(2πt) + cos(4πt) + cos(6πt), we can use the Euler's formula to rewrite the cosine functions as:\n\ncos(θ) = (e^(jθ) + e^(-jθ)) / 2\n\nSo, f(t) = (e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt))/2 + (e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt))/2 + (e^(j6πt) + e^(-j6πt))/2\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(ω):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[((e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt))/2 + (e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt))/2 + (e^(j6πt) + e^(-j6πt))/2) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nThis integral can be separated into three integrals:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)∫[e^(j(2π-ω)t) + e^(j(2π+ω)t)] dt + (1/2)∫[e^(j(4π-ω)t) + e^(j(4π+ω)t)] dt + (1/2)∫[e^(j(6π-ω)t) + e^(j(6π+ω)t)] dt\n\nEach of these integrals is a Fourier transform of a complex exponential, which results in a Dirac delta function:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)[δ(ω-2π) + δ(ω+2π)] + (1/2)[δ(ω-4π) + δ(ω+4π)] + (1/2)[δ(ω-6π) + δ(ω+6π)]\n\n2. Determine the frequencies present in the signal and their corresponding amplitudes.\n\nFrom the Fourier transform F(ω), we can see that there are three pairs of frequencies present in the signal:\n\nω1 = ±2π, ω2 = ±4π, and ω3 = ±6π\n\nThe corresponding amplitudes for these frequencies are:\n\nA1 = 1/2, A2 = 1/2, and A3 = 1/2\n\n3. Sketch the spectrum of the signal f(t).\n\nThe spectrum will consist of six spikes (Dirac delta functions) at the frequencies ±2π, ±4π, and ±6π, each with an amplitude of 1/2.\n\n4. Find the inverse Fourier transform of the spectrum obtained in step 3.\n\nThe inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫[F(ω) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\nUsing the Fourier transform F(ω) obtained in step 1:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫[((1/2)[δ(ω-2π) + δ(ω+2π)] + (1/2)[δ(ω-4π) + δ(ω+4π)] + (1/2)[δ(ω-6π) + δ(ω+6π)]) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\nDue to the properties of the Dirac delta function, the inverse Fourier transform simplifies to:\n\nf(t) = (1/2)(e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt)) + (1/2)(e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) + (1/2)(e^(j6πt) + e^(-j6πt))\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite this as:\n\nf(t) = cos(2πt) + cos(4πt) + cos(6πt)\n\n5. Verify that the reconstructed signal is indeed f(t).\n\nComparing the reconstructed signal obtained in step 4 with the original signal, we can see that they are the same:\n\nf(t) = cos(2πt) + cos(4πt) + cos(6πt)"
