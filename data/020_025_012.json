The distances between the locations are as follows:\n\n- A to B: 5 kilometers\n- A to C: 3 kilometers\n- A to D: 7 kilometers\n- B to C: 6 kilometers\n- B to D: 4 kilometers\n- C to D: 2 kilometers\n\nThe delivery person must start and end at location A. What is the optimal route with the least amount of distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route with the least amount of distance traveled, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then choose the one with the smallest distance.\n\nThere are 3! (3 factorial) = 6 possible routes since the delivery person must start and end at location A:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A\n2. A → B → D → C → A\n3. A → C → B → D → A\n4. A → C → D → B → A\n5. A → D → B → C → A\n6. A → D → C → B → A\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A: 5 + 6 + 2 + 7 = 20 kilometers\n2. A → B → D → C → A: 5 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 14 kilometers\n3. A → C → B → D → A: 3 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 20 kilometers\n4. A → C → D → B → A: 3 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 14 kilometers\n5. A → D → B → C → A: 7 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 20 kilometers\n6. A → D → C → B → A: 7 + 2 + 6 + 5 = 20 kilometers\n\nThe optimal routes with the least amount of distance traveled are routes 2 and 4, both with a total distance of 14 kilometers:\n\n- Route 2: A → B → D → C → A\n- Route 4: A → C → D → B → A"
