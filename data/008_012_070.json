    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the inverse matrix method, we first need to write the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  8  |\n    | -7  |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we use the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of matrix A and adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -5) - (2 * 4) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of matrix A:\n\nadj(A) = | -5  -2 |\n         | -4   3 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-23) * | -5  -2 |\n                   | -4   3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/23  2/23 |\n         | 4/23 -3/23 |\n\nNow that we have the inverse of matrix A, we can find the solution to the system of equations by multiplying A^(-1) with matrix B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/23  2/23 | * |  8  |\n    |  4/23 -3/23 |   | -7  |\n\nX = | (5/23 * 8) + (2/23 * -7) |\n    | (4/23 * 8) + (-3/23 * -7) |\n\nX = | 40/23 - 14/23 |\n    | 32/23 + 21/23 |\n\nX = | 26/23 |\n    | 53/23 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 26/23 and y = 53/23."
