    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges in a graph such that every vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph. We can represent the graph as follows:\n\n```\n1 -- 2 -- 4 -- 8\n \\    \\\n  \\    5 -- 8\n   \\\n    3 -- 6 -- 8\n     \\\n      7 -- 8\n```\n\nNow, let's try to find a perfect matching for this graph. One possible perfect matching is the set of edges {(1, 2), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 8), (7, 8)}. However, this set of edges has 5 edges, and there are 8 vertices in the graph. Since a perfect matching requires that every vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex, this set of edges cannot be a perfect matching.\n\nLet's try another set of edges: {(1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)}. This set of edges also has 5 edges, and there are 8 vertices in the graph. Again, this set of edges cannot be a perfect matching.\n\nSince we cannot find a set of edges that satisfies the conditions for a perfect matching, we can conclude that this graph does not have a perfect matching."
