    "message_1": "A student wants to model the weather in their city using a Markov chain. The weather can be either sunny, cloudy, or rainy. The probability of sun on any given day is 0.6, the probability of a cloudy day after a sunny day is 0.3, and the probability of rain after a sunny day is 0.1. If it is cloudy today, the probability of sun tomorrow is 0.5, and the probability of rain tomorrow is 0.4. What is the probability that it will be rainy two days from now, given that it is sunny today?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that it will be rainy two days from now, given that it is sunny today, we need to consider two possible scenarios: (1) it will be cloudy tomorrow, and (2) it will be rainy tomorrow. We will then find the probability of rain on the second day for each scenario and sum them up.\n\nScenario 1: Cloudy tomorrow\nProbability of cloudy tomorrow given sunny today: P(C|S) = 0.3\nProbability of rain after a cloudy day: P(R|C) = 0.4\nProbability of rain two days from now in this scenario: P(C|S) * P(R|C) = 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12\n\nScenario 2: Rainy tomorrow\nProbability of rainy tomorrow given sunny today: P(R|S) = 0.1\nSince it will be rainy tomorrow, the probability of rain two days from now is the same as the probability of rain after a rainy day. However, we don't have this information. We can find the probability of a sunny day after a rainy day using the given information:\n\nP(S) = 0.6\nP(C|S) = 0.3\nP(R|S) = 0.1\nP(S|C) = 0.5\nP(R|C) = 0.4\n\nWe know that the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes after a rainy day should be equal to 1:\n\nP(S|R) + P(C|R) + P(R|R) = 1\n\nWe also know that the probability of a sunny day after a rainy day is the same as the probability of a sunny day in general:\n\nP(S|R) = P(S) = 0.6\n\nNow we can find the probability of a cloudy day after a rainy day:\n\nP(C|R) = 1 - P(S|R) - P(R|R)\n\nSince we have two unknowns (P(C|R) and P(R|R)), we cannot solve this equation. Therefore, we cannot find the probability of rain two days from now in this scenario.\n\nAs a result, we can only calculate the probability of rain two days from now based on the first scenario:\n\nP(Rain two days from now | Sunny today) = 0.12"
