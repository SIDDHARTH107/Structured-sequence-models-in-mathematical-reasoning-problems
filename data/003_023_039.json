    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √((-2)^2 + 1^2 + 3^2) = √(4 + 1 + 9) = √14\n|B| = √(4^2 + (-5)^2 + 6^2) = √(16 + 25 + 36) = √77\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula for this:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nThe dot product of A and B is:\n\nA · B = (-2)(4) + (1)(-5) + (3)(6) = -8 - 5 + 18 = 5\n\nNow we can find the cosine of the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = 5 / (√14 * √77) = 5 / (√1078)\n\nNow we find the sine of the angle θ using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - cos^2(θ) = 1 - (5 / √1078)^2 = 1 - 25/1078 = 1053/1078\nsin(θ) = √(1053/1078)\n\nNow we can find the cross product magnitude:\n\n|A x B| = |A| |B| sin(θ) = √14 * √77 * √(1053/1078) = √(14 * 77 * 1053/1078)\n\nTo find the direction of the cross product (unit vector n), we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nA x B = (1(6) - 3(-5), 3(4) - (-2)(6), -2(-5) - 1(4)) = (6 + 15, 12 + 12, 10 - 4) = (21, 24, 6)\n\nNow we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:\n\n|A x B| = √(21^2 + 24^2 + 6^2) = √(441 + 576 + 36) = √1053\n\nNow we can find the unit vector n:\n\nn = (21/√1053, 24/√1053, 6/√1053)\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product of A and B:\n\nA x B = |A x B| n = √(14 * 77 * 1053/1078) * (21/√1053, 24/√1053, 6/√1053)\n\nA x B = (√(14 * 77 * 1053/1078) * 21/√1053, √(14 * 77 * 1053/1078) * 24/√1053, √(14 * 77 * 1053/1078) * 6/√1053)\n\nA x B = (21√(14 * 77/1078), 24√(14 * 77/1078), 6√(14 * 77/1078))\n\nThis is the cross product of vector A and vector B using trigonometry."
