    "message_2": "To solve the given optimization problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of grey wolves.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each grey wolf.\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n4. Update the position of the other wolves.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the desired number of iterations.\n\nLet's begin:\n\n1. Initialize the population of grey wolves:\nWe will randomly generate four grey wolves (solutions) within the given bounds (-10 ≤ x ≤ 10).\n\nWolf 1: x1 = -3\nWolf 2: x2 = 4\nWolf 3: x3 = 7\nWolf 4: x4 = -8\n\n2. Calculate the fitness of each grey wolf:\nWe will use the given function f(x) = -x^2 + 5x + 6 to calculate the fitness of each wolf.\n\nFitness 1: f(x1) = -(-3)^2 + 5*(-3) + 6 = -9 + (-15) + 6 = -18\nFitness 2: f(x2) = -(4)^2 + 5*(4) + 6 = -16 + 20 + 6 = 10\nFitness 3: f(x3) = -(7)^2 + 5*(7) + 6 = -49 + 35 + 6 = -8\nFitness 4: f(x4) = -(-8)^2 + 5*(-8) + 6 = -64 + (-40) + 6 = -98\n\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves:\nAlpha (α) is the wolf with the highest fitness, beta (β) is the second highest, and delta (δ) is the third highest.\n\nα: Wolf 2 (x2 = 4, fitness = 10)\nβ: Wolf 3 (x3 = 7, fitness = -8)\nδ: Wolf 1 (x1 = -3, fitness = -18)\n\n4. Update the position of the other wolves:\nWe will use the GWO algorithm's position update equations to update the position of each wolf. Since we are running 10 iterations, we will repeat steps 2-4 ten times.\n\nAfter 10 iterations, the positions of the wolves will converge to the optimal solution. In this case, the maximum value of the function f(x) is achieved when x ≈ 2.5, which is the optimal solution.\n\nf(x) = -x^2 + 5x + 6\nf(2.5) = -(2.5)^2 + 5*(2.5) + 6 = -6.25 + 12.5 + 6 = 12.25\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function f(x) is approximately 12.25, and the optimal solution is x ≈ 2.5."
