    "message_1": "A company wants to test their new product by experimenting on different combinations of four factors (A, B, C, D). Each factor has three levels each (low, medium, high). Generate an orthogonal array for this experiment which requires 12 runs. How many experimental conditions will remain if you remove factor D from the experiment?",
    "message_2": "To create an orthogonal array for this experiment with 12 runs, we can use the L9 (3^4) orthogonal array, which is a 9-run orthogonal array for 4 factors, each with 3 levels. However, since the company wants to conduct 12 runs, we can duplicate the L9 array and randomly assign the levels of factor D to the additional 3 runs.\n\nHere is the L9 orthogonal array:\n\nRun | A | B | C | D\n----|---|---|---|---\n1   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1\n2   | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2\n3   | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3\n4   | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3\n5   | 2 | 2 | 3 | 1\n6   | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2\n7   | 3 | 1 | 3 | 2\n8   | 3 | 2 | 1 | 3\n9   | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1\n\nNow, we can add three more runs with randomly assigned levels of factor D:\n\nRun | A | B | C | D\n----|---|---|---|---\n10  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2\n11  | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3\n12  | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2\n\nNow, if we remove factor D from the experiment, we will have the following experimental conditions:\n\nRun | A | B | C\n----|---|---|---\n1   | 1 | 1 | 1\n2   | 1 | 2 | 2\n3   | 1 | 3 | 3\n4   | 2 | 1 | 2\n5   | 2 | 2 | 3\n6   | 2 | 3 | 1\n7   | 3 | 1 | 3\n8   | 3 | 2 | 1\n9   | 3 | 3 | 2\n10  | 1 | 1 | 1\n11  | 2 | 2 | 3\n12  | 3 | 3 | 2\n\nHowever, there are duplicate experimental conditions (runs 1 and 10, runs 5 and 11, runs 9 and 12). So, after removing the duplicates, we have the following unique experimental conditions:\n\nRun | A | B | C\n----|---|---|---\n1   | 1 | 1 | 1\n2   | 1 | 2 | 2\n3   | 1 | 3 | 3\n4   | 2 | 1 | 2\n5   | 2 | 2 | 3\n6   | 2 | 3 | 1\n7   | 3 | 1 | 3\n8   | 3 | 2 | 1\n9   | 3 | 3 | 2\n\nThere are 9 unique experimental conditions remaining after removing factor D from the experiment."
