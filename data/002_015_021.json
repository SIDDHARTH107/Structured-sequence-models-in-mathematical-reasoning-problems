    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (also known as the circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter of the circle is 20 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(20 cm)\nC ≈ 3.14159 × 20 cm\nC ≈ 62.8318 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 62.83 cm."
