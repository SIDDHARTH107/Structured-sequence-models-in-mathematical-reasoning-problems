    "message_1": "In a beauty contest game, there are 100 players who must choose a whole number between 0 and 100. The winner will be the person who chooses a number closest to 2/3 of the average number chosen by all players. What number should a player choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the average number chosen by all players as A. The target number to win the game is (2/3)A. To maximize the chances of winning, a player should try to predict the average number chosen by all players and then choose a number close to (2/3)A.\n\nAssuming all players are rational and think similarly, they would expect the average to be around 50 (since it's the midpoint of 0 and 100). However, knowing that everyone is trying to choose (2/3) of the average, they would adjust their choice to (2/3) * 50 = 33.33.\n\nBut if everyone thinks this way, then the new average would be around 33.33, and the target number would be (2/3) * 33.33 = 22.22. This reasoning can be applied iteratively, with each step assuming that all players have adjusted their choices based on the previous average.\n\nThis process converges to a value close to 0, as the adjustments become smaller and smaller. However, since the problem asks for a whole number, the best choice for a player to maximize their chances of winning would be to choose 1, as it is the closest whole number to the converged value."
