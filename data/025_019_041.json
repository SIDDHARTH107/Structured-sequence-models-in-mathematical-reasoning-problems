    "message_2": "Let X be a Fano variety of dimension two with Picard number 1. This means that the Picard group Pic(X) is generated by a single element, which we can take to be the anticanonical divisor -K_X. Since there exists a global section of the anticanonical line bundle, we have an effective divisor D in the linear system |-K_X|. \n\nNow, we want to compute the degree of X, which is the intersection number of the anticanonical divisor with itself, i.e., deg(X) = (-K_X) · (-K_X).\n\nBy the adjunction formula, we have K_X + K_C = K_X|_C for any curve C in X. Since X is a Fano variety, -K_X is ample, and so -K_X|_C is ample as well. This means that the intersection number (-K_X) · (-K_X) is positive.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection number (-K_X) · D. Since D is in the linear system |-K_X|, we have D ≡ -K_X, and so (-K_X) · D = (-K_X) · (-K_X) > 0. \n\nFinally, we compute the degree of X using the intersection number:\n\ndeg(X) = (-K_X) · (-K_X) = D · (-K_X) > 0.\n\nThus, the degree of X is a positive integer. However, without more information about the specific Fano variety X, we cannot determine the exact value of the degree."
