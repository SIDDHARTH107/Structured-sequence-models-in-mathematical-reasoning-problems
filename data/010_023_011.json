    "message_1": "What is the minimum number of cuts required to free a knot with 6 crossings?\n\nNote: This problem is meant to be solved using techniques from Geometric Topology and Knot Theory, such as understanding the mathematical properties of knots and how they can be untangled through topological manipulations.",
    "message_2": "In knot theory, the minimum number of cuts required to free a knot is known as the unknotting number. The unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of times the knot must be passed through itself (i.e., the minimum number of crossing changes) to untangle it into a simple loop (the unknot).\n\nFor a knot with 6 crossings, it could be the 6_1 knot or the 6_2 knot (using the Alexander-Briggs notation). The unknotting number of the 6_1 knot is 1, and the unknotting number of the 6_2 knot is also 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of cuts required to free a knot with 6 crossings is 1."
