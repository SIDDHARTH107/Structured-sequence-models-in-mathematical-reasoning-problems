    "message_1": "Suppose there are three political parties in a country - Party A, Party B and Party C. The probability of Party A winning the election is 0.4, the probability of Party B winning the election is 0.3 and the probability of Party C winning the election is 0.3. What is the probability that either Party A or Party B wins the election?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that either Party A or Party B wins the election, we simply add their individual probabilities:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)\n\nP(A or B) = 0.4 + 0.3\n\nP(A or B) = 0.7\n\nSo, the probability that either Party A or Party B wins the election is 0.7 or 70%."
