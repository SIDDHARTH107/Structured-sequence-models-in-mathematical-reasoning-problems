The seller knows the true quality of the car while the buyer does not. The value of a lemon to the buyer is $2,000 and the value of a peach to the buyer is $4,000. The seller values the car at $2,500 regardless of its quality. What is the expected value of the used car market for both the buyer and the seller?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the used car market for both the buyer and the seller, we need to consider the probabilities and values of each type of car.\n\nFor the buyer:\n\nExpected value of a lemon (L) = P(L) * Value(L) = 0.6 * $2,000 = $1,200\nExpected value of a peach (P) = P(P) * Value(P) = 0.4 * $4,000 = $1,600\n\nTotal expected value for the buyer = Expected value of a lemon + Expected value of a peach = $1,200 + $1,600 = $2,800\n\nFor the seller:\n\nSince the seller values the car at $2,500 regardless of its quality, the expected value for the seller is simply $2,500.\n\nIn summary, the expected value of the used car market for the buyer is $2,800, and the expected value for the seller is $2,500."
