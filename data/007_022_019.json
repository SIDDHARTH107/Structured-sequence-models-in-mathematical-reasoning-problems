    "message_2": "To find the third point R on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 7 (mod 17) such that P + Q + R = O, we first need to find the slope of the line passing through points P and Q.\n\nThe slope m can be calculated using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nHowever, since we are working in the field of integers modulo 17, we need to find the modular inverse of (x2 - x1) modulo 17. Let's denote the modular inverse as (x2 - x1)^(-1).\n\nFirst, let's find the difference in x and y coordinates:\n\nΔx = x2 - x1 = 4 - 2 = 2\nΔy = y2 - y1 = -5 - 3 = -8\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of Δx modulo 17:\n\n2^(-1) (mod 17)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that the modular inverse of 2 modulo 17 is 9:\n\n2 * 9 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we can find the slope m:\n\nm = Δy * (Δx)^(-1) = -8 * 9 (mod 17) = -72 (mod 17) = 3 (mod 17)\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can find the coordinates of the third point R using the following formulas:\n\nxR = m^2 - x1 - x2 (mod 17)\nyR = m(x1 - xR) - y1 (mod 17)\n\nCalculating xR:\n\nxR = 3^2 - 2 - 4 (mod 17) = 9 - 6 (mod 17) = 3 (mod 17)\n\nCalculating yR:\n\nyR = 3(2 - 3) - 3 (mod 17) = -3 - 3 (mod 17) = -6 (mod 17) = 11 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the coordinates of the third point R are (3, 11)."
