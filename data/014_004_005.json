    "message_2": "To find the public and private keys using elliptic curve cryptography, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an elliptic curve with parameters a and b. In this case, a = -3 and b = 5.\n2. Choose a base point G on the curve. In this case, G = (0, 1).\n3. Choose a random integer n as the private key. In this case, n = 12.\n4. Calculate the public key P by multiplying the base point G by the private key n.\n\nThe elliptic curve equation is given by:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + ax + b\n\nIn this case, the equation is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 3x + 5\n\nNow, we need to perform point multiplication to find the public key P. Point multiplication is the process of adding a point on the curve to itself n times. In this case, we need to add the base point G to itself 12 times.\n\nTo perform point multiplication, we need to use the point addition and point doubling formulas. The point addition formula for two distinct points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) on the curve is:\n\nx3 = ((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1))^2 - x1 - x2\ny3 = ((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)) * (x1 - x3) - y1\n\nThe point doubling formula for a point P1(x1, y1) on the curve is:\n\nx3 = ((3 * x1^2 + a) / (2 * y1))^2 - 2 * x1\ny3 = ((3 * x1^2 + a) / (2 * y1)) * (x1 - x3) - y1\n\nNow, let's perform point multiplication:\n\n1. Calculate 2G (point doubling):\nx3 = ((3 * 0^2 - 3) / (2 * 1))^2 - 2 * 0 = 2\ny3 = ((3 * 0^2 - 3) / (2 * 1)) * (0 - 2) - 1 = -3\n2G = (2, -3)\n\n2. Calculate 4G (point doubling of 2G):\nx3 = ((3 * 2^2 - 3) / (2 * -3))^2 - 2 * 2 = 1\ny3 = ((3 * 2^2 - 3) / (2 * -3)) * (2 - 1) - (-3) = 3\n4G = (1, 3)\n\n3. Calculate 8G (point doubling of 4G):\nx3 = ((3 * 1^2 - 3) / (2 * 3))^2 - 2 * 1 = -1\ny3 = ((3 * 1^2 - 3) / (2 * 3)) * (1 - (-1)) - 3 = 1\n8G = (-1, 1)\n\n4. Calculate 12G (point addition of 8G and 4G):\nx3 = ((1 - 3) / (-1 - 1))^2 - (-1) - 1 = 0\ny3 = ((1 - 3) / (-1 - 1)) * (-1 - 0) - 1 = -1\n12G = (0, -1)\n\nSo, the public key P is (0, -1), and the private key n is 12."
