    "message_1": "Solve the following system of linear equations with ill-conditioned matrices, where A is the matrix and b is the constant vector:\n\n```\nA = [[2, 1, 1],\n     [4, 3, 3],\n     [8, 7, 7]]\n    \nb = [4, 10, 20]\n```\n\nFind the solution vector x using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. Round your answer to 2 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to apply Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. We start by finding the largest element in the first column, which is 8. We swap the third row with the first row:\n\n```\nA = [[8, 7, 7],\n     [4, 3, 3],\n     [2, 1, 1]]\n\nb = [20, 10, 4]\n```\n\nNext, we eliminate the first element in the second and third rows. To do this, we subtract a multiple of the first row from the second and third rows:\n\n```\nR2 = R2 - (1/2) * R1\nR3 = R3 - (1/4) * R1\n\nA = [[8, 7, 7],\n     [0, -0.5, -0.5],\n     [0, -0.75, -0.75]]\n\nb = [20, 0, -1]\n```\n\nNow, we find the largest element in the second column of the remaining submatrix, which is -0.5. We don't need to swap rows in this case, as the largest element is already in the second row. We proceed to eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 - (1.5) * R2\n\nA = [[8, 7, 7],\n     [0, -0.5, -0.5],\n     [0, 0, 0]]\n\nb = [20, 0, 1]\n```\n\nSince the last row of the matrix A is all zeros, we have a singular matrix, and the system of equations does not have a unique solution. However, we can still find a general solution for x:\n\n```\nx3 = t (a free variable)\n\nx2 = -2 * x3\n\nx1 = (20 - 7 * x2 - 7 * x3) / 8\n```\n\nSubstituting x2 and x3 into the equation for x1:\n\n```\nx1 = (20 - 7 * (-2 * x3) - 7 * x3) / 8\nx1 = (20 + 14 * x3 - 7 * x3) / 8\nx1 = (20 + 7 * x3) / 8\n```\n\nSo the general solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx1 = (20 + 7 * t) / 8\nx2 = -2 * t\nx3 = t\n```\n\nWhere t is any real number."
