If we repeatedly apply the construction process of the Peano curve to each sub-segment, what is the total length of the resulting curve after n iterations? (Assume that we always divide each segment into three equal parts and replace the middle part with a zigzag pattern that has four line segments.)",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the construction process of the Peano curve. In each iteration, we divide the line segment into three equal parts and replace the middle part with a zigzag pattern that has four line segments. This means that after each iteration, the total length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nLet L_n be the total length of the curve after n iterations. We can express L_n as follows:\n\nL_n = L_(n-1) * (4/3)\n\nSince we start with a line segment of length 1, we have L_0 = 1. Now, we can use the above formula to find the total length of the curve after n iterations:\n\nL_n = L_0 * (4/3)^n\nL_n = 1 * (4/3)^n\nL_n = (4/3)^n\n\nSo, the total length of the resulting curve after n iterations is (4/3)^n."
