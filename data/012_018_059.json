    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph into two non-empty components, we need to ensure that there is no path between any pair of vertices belonging to different components. In other words, we need to remove all the edges that connect the two components.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario, where the graph is as connected as possible while still having 10 vertices and 20 edges. In this case, the graph would be a complete graph with 9 vertices (K9), which has 9 * (9 - 1) / 2 = 36 edges, plus one additional vertex connected to one of the vertices in K9, adding one more edge. So, the graph would have 37 edges in total.\n\nHowever, we are given that the graph has only 20 edges. This means that the graph is not a complete graph, and there must be some vertices with a lower degree. To minimize the number of edges that need to be removed, we should aim to disconnect the graph by removing edges from vertices with lower degrees.\n\nLet's consider the case where we have two components with sizes n1 and n2, where n1 + n2 = 10. To minimize the number of edges that need to be removed, we should aim for a balanced split, so let's assume n1 = 5 and n2 = 5. In this case, the maximum number of edges within each component is given by the complete graph formula:\n\nEdges within component 1: 5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 10\nEdges within component 2: 5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 10\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges within the two components is 20, which is equal to the total number of edges in the graph. This means that there is at least one edge connecting the two components.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph into two non-empty components is 1."
