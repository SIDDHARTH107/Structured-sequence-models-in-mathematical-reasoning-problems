    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate the square root term.\n2. Square both sides of the equation.\n3. Solve for x.\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\nsqrt(3x - 7) + 4 = 9\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\nsqrt(3x - 7) = 5\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation.\n(sqrt(3x - 7))^2 = 5^2\n3x - 7 = 25\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\n3x - 7 = 25\nAdd 7 to both sides:\n3x = 32\nDivide by 3:\nx = 32/3\n\nSo, x = 32/3."
