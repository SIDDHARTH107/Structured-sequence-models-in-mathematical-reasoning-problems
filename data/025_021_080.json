    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the cubic mirror Calabi-Yau threefold defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + t^3 = 0$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and set them equal to zero. \n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + t^3) = 3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + t^3) = 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + t^3) = 3z^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + t^3) = 3t^2$\n\nSetting these equal to zero, we get:\n\n$3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\n$3z^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow z = 0$\n\n$3t^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow t = 0$\n\nThus, the only singular point is the origin $(0, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's determine the Hodge numbers of the Calabi-Yau threefold. For a Calabi-Yau threefold, the Hodge diamond has the following structure:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n & & & & 1 & & & & \\\\\n & & & 0 & & 0 & & & \\\\\n & & h^{1,1} & & h^{2,1} & & h^{1,1} & & \\\\\n & 0 & & h^{2,1} & & h^{2,1} & & 0 & \\\\\n & & & & 1 & & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a Calabi-Yau threefold is zero, which can be computed as:\n\n$\\chi = 2(h^{1,1} - h^{2,1})$\n\nSince $\\chi = 0$, we have:\n\n$h^{1,1} = h^{2,1}$\n\nFor a cubic threefold, the Hodge numbers are $h^{1,1} = 1$ and $h^{2,1} = 1$. Therefore, the Hodge diamond for this cubic mirror Calabi-Yau threefold is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n & & & & 1 & & & & \\\\\n & & & 0 & & 0 & & & \\\\\n & & 1 & & 1 & & 1 & & \\\\\n & 0 & & 1 & & 1 & & 0 & \\\\\n & & & & 1 & & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$"
