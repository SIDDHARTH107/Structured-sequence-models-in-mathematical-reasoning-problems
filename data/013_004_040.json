    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nAlice and Bob are planning to go out to dinner. Alice wants to go to a steakhouse and Bob wants to go to a sushi restaurant. However, they both prefer to go to the same restaurant rather than going to their respective preferred restaurant alone.\n\nThey can communicate with each other but cannot coordinate their choices. Each of them writes down their restaurant preference on a piece of paper and they reveal their choices simultaneously.\n\nIf they both choose the steakhouse, they each receive a payoff of 3. If they both choose the sushi restaurant, they each receive a payoff of 2. If Alice chooses the steakhouse and Bob chooses the sushi restaurant or vice versa, they each receive a payoff of 1.\n\nWhat are the best strategies for Alice and Bob to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their payoff, Alice and Bob should use a mixed strategy, which means they will randomly choose between the steakhouse and the sushi restaurant with certain probabilities.\n\nLet p be the probability that Alice chooses the steakhouse and q be the probability that Bob chooses the steakhouse. Then, the probability that Alice chooses the sushi restaurant is (1-p) and the probability that Bob chooses the sushi restaurant is (1-q).\n\nThe expected payoff for Alice when she chooses the steakhouse is:\nE(Alice | Steakhouse) = 3q + 1(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\nThe expected payoff for Alice when she chooses the sushi restaurant is:\nE(Alice | Sushi) = 1q + 2(1-q) = 2 - q\n\nFor Alice to be indifferent between the two choices, the expected payoffs should be equal:\n2q + 1 = 2 - q\n3q = 1\nq = 1/3\n\nSimilarly, for Bob:\nE(Bob | Steakhouse) = 3p + 1(1-p) = 2p + 1\nE(Bob | Sushi) = 1p + 2(1-p) = 2 - p\n\nFor Bob to be indifferent between the two choices, the expected payoffs should be equal:\n2p + 1 = 2 - p\n3p = 1\np = 1/3\n\nSo, the best strategy for both Alice and Bob is to choose the steakhouse with a probability of 1/3 and the sushi restaurant with a probability of 2/3. This mixed strategy will maximize their expected payoff."
