    "message_2": "1) (A × B)' \nFirst, we need to find the Cartesian product A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, we need to find the complement of A × B, denoted as (A × B)'. Since A and B are subsets of the universal set U, we need to know the universal set U to find the complement. However, the universal set U is not given in the problem, so we cannot find (A × B)'.\n\n2) A' × B'\nSimilarly, to find A' and B', we need to know the universal set U. Since U is not given, we cannot find A' and B', and therefore we cannot find A' × B'.\n\n3) (A' × B')'\nAs we cannot find A' × B' due to the unknown universal set U, we also cannot find the complement of A' × B', denoted as (A' × B')'.\n\nTo prove that (A × B)' ≠ A' × B', we need to know the universal set U and find the complements of A, B, and A × B. Since U is not given, we cannot prove this statement."
