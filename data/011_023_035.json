    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is determined by the graph's chromatic number. The chromatic number depends on the structure of the graph and its maximum degree (the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex).\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph with 6 vertices is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the maximum degree is 5 (each vertex is connected to the other 5 vertices). For a complete graph, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices, so you would need 6 colors to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not complete and has a lower maximum degree, the chromatic number could be smaller. For example, if the graph is a cycle with an even number of vertices (like a hexagon), you would only need 2 colors. In other cases, you might need 3 or 4 colors.\n\nSo, the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph with 6 vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color can range from 2 to 6, depending on the structure of the graph."
