    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (2x^2 - 3x + 1) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1, we can try to simplify the function first.\n\nWe can attempt to factor the numerator:\n\n2x^2 - 3x + 1 = (2x - 1)(x - 1)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = ((2x - 1)(x - 1)) / (x - 1)\n\nSince (x - 1) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\nf(x) = 2x - 1\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 1:\n\nlim (x -> 1) (2x - 1) = 2(1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (2x^2 - 3x + 1) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1 is 1."
