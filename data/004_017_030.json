    "message_1": "A curve is defined by the equation y = x^2/2 between x=0 and x=4. What is the arc length of the curve between these two points?",
    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^2/2 between x = 0 and x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^2/2\ndy/dx = d(x^2/2)/dx = x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + x^2) dx\n\nThis integral is not elementary, so we'll use a numerical method to approximate the arc length. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integrator, we get:\n\nL ≈ 6.08276\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^2/2 between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 6.08276."
