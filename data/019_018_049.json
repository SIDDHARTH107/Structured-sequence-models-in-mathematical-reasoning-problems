If 𝑇 ⊨ 𝐴, then 𝐴 is provable using only the axioms in {𝑇}.\n\nLet's prove each direction separately.\n\n(1) If 𝐴 is provable using only the axioms in {𝑇}, then 𝑇 ⊨ 𝐴:\n\nAssume that 𝐴 is provable using only the axioms in {𝑇}. This means that there exists a proof of 𝐴 using only the axioms in {𝑇} and the rules of inference. Since the proof is valid, 𝐴 must be true whenever all the axioms in {𝑇} are true. In other words, any model that satisfies all the axioms in {𝑇} must also satisfy 𝐴. This is precisely the definition of entailment, so we can conclude that 𝑇 ⊨ 𝐴.\n\n(2) If 𝑇 ⊨ 𝐴, then 𝐴 is provable using only the axioms in {𝑇}:\n\nAssume that 𝑇 ⊨ 𝐴. This means that any model that satisfies all the axioms in {𝑇} must also satisfy 𝐴. Our goal is to show that there exists a proof of 𝐴 using only the axioms in {𝑇} and the rules of inference.\n\nConsider any model M that satisfies all the axioms in {𝑇}. Since 𝑇 ⊨ 𝐴, we know that M must also satisfy 𝐴. Now, we can use the completeness theorem, which states that if a formula is true in every model that satisfies a given set of axioms, then it is provable from those axioms. Therefore, since 𝐴 is true in every model that satisfies {𝑇}, there must exist a proof of 𝐴 using only the axioms in {𝑇} and the rules of inference.\n\nThus, we have shown both directions, and we can conclude that 𝐴 is provable using only the axioms in {𝑇} if and only if 𝑇 ⊨ 𝐴."
