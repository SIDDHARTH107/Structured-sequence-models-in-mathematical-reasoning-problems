    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for all possible routes and then selecting the one with the minimum distance. There are 5 cities, so there are 5! (factorial) possible routes. However, since the route is circular and we can start and end at any city, we can divide the number of routes by 5, resulting in 4! = 24 possible routes to consider.\n\nHere are all the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1.
