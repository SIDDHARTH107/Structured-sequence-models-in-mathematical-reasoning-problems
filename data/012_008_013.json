    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar or non-planar, we can use the planarity criterion, which is based on Euler's formula for planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (regions, including the outer region).\n\nKuratowski's theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nFor our graph G with 10 vertices (V = 10) and 15 edges (E = 15), we can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for our graph:\n\n15 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds true, so it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, this is not a guarantee, as we still need to check for the presence of a K5 or K3,3 subgraph.\n\nSince the graph has only 10 vertices, it cannot contain a K5 subgraph, which requires 5 vertices. However, it could potentially contain a K3,3 subgraph. To form a K3,3 subgraph, we would need at least 9 edges (each vertex in one partition connects to all 3 vertices in the other partition). Our graph has 15 edges, so it is possible for it to contain a K3,3 subgraph.\n\nWithout more information about the specific connections between vertices in the graph, we cannot definitively determine if the graph G is planar or non-planar. If it does not contain a K3,3 subgraph, then it is planar; otherwise, it is non-planar."
