    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 - 8x + 5, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 - 8x + 5, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nAntiderivative of 4x^3:\nUsing the power rule, n = 3, so the antiderivative is (4x^(3+1))/(3+1) = x^4.\n\nAntiderivative of 2x^2:\nUsing the power rule, n = 2, so the antiderivative is (2x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (2/3)x^3.\n\nAntiderivative of -8x:\nUsing the power rule, n = 1, so the antiderivative is (-8x^(1+1))/(1+1) = -4x^2.\n\nAntiderivative of 5:\nSince 5 is a constant, its antiderivative is 5x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nF(x) = x^4 + (2/3)x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + C"
