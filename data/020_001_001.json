    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces product A and product B. The profit from product A is $10 per unit and from product B is $20 per unit. To produce one unit of product A, it requires 1 hour of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while to produce one unit of product B, it requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. The company has 100 hours of labor and 80 hours of machine time available. Determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by the company subject to the available resources.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 20y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1x + 2y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 80 (machine time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 1x + 2y = 100\ny = (100 - x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 1y = 80\ny = 80 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. We will find the intersection points of the constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and machine time constraint:\n1x + 2y = 100\n2x + 1y = 80\n\nSolving the system of equations, we get:\nx = 20\ny = 40\n\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n1x + 2(0) = 100\nx = 100\n\n3. Intersection of machine time constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n2(0) + 1y = 80\ny = 80\n\nSo, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 80), (100, 0), and (20, 40).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 80) = 10(0) + 20(80) = $1600\n2. P(100, 0) = 10(100) + 20(0) = $1000\n3. P(20, 40) = 10(20) + 20(40) = $1000\n\nThe maximum profit is $1600, which is obtained when the company produces 0 units of product A and 80 units of product B."
