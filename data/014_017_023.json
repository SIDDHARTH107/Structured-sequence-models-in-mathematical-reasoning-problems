    "message_1": "Suppose you have a message encrypted using a substitution cipher. You perform a frequency analysis on the encrypted message and find that the most common letter in the message appears 16 times. If the message contains a total of 200 letters, what is the frequency of occurrence of the most common letter in the original message? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a percent.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of occurrence of the most common letter in the original message, you can use the following formula:\n\nFrequency = (Number of occurrences of the most common letter / Total number of letters in the message) * 100\n\nFrequency = (16 / 200) * 100\n\nFrequency = 0.08 * 100\n\nFrequency = 8%\n\nSo, the frequency of occurrence of the most common letter in the original message is approximately 8%."
