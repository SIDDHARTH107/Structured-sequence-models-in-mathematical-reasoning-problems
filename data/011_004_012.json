    "message_2": "In this case, we don't need to calculate a multinomial coefficient. We can simply use the counting principle.\n\nFor each of the four exams, the student has five problems to choose from. So, the total number of ways to choose one problem from each exam is:\n\n5 (choices for exam 1) * 5 (choices for exam 2) * 5 (choices for exam 3) * 5 (choices for exam 4) = 5^4 = 625 ways."
