If they are, provide an isomorphism between the two graphs.",
    "message_2": "The graphs G and H are isomorphic. We can see that both graphs have two disconnected components, each forming a square with 4 vertices and 4 edges. We can provide an isomorphism between the two graphs by mapping the vertices of G to the corresponding vertices of H as follows:\n\nA -> 1\nB -> 2\nC -> 3\nD -> 4\nE -> 6\nF -> 7\nG -> 8\nH -> 9\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency of the vertices, and thus, G and H are isomorphic."
