    "message_2": "First, let's perform Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix:\n\n|  2  3  4 | 1\n|  5  7  8 | 2.5\n| 10  9 13 | 5.5\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 | 0.5\n|  5  7  8  | 2.5\n| 10  9 13 | 5.5\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the first row:\n\nSubtract 5 times the first row from the second row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2  | 0.5\n|  0  0.5  2  | 0\n| 10  9  13 | 5.5\n\nSubtract 10 times the first row from the third row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2  | 0.5\n|  0  0.5  2  | 0\n|  0 -6 -7  | 0\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 0.5 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2  | 0.5\n|  0  1  4    | 0\n|  0 -6 -7  | 0\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below and above the second row:\n\nAdd 6 times the second row to the third row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2  | 0.5\n|  0  1  4    | 0\n|  0  0  17  | 0\n\nSubtract 1.5 times the second row from the first row:\n\n|  1  0 -4  | 0.5\n|  0  1  4    | 0\n|  0  0  17  | 0\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 17 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n|  1  0 -4  | 0.5\n|  0  1  4    | 0\n|  0  0  1    | 0\n\nStep 6: Eliminate the third column above the third row:\n\nAdd 4 times the third row to the first row:\n\n|  1  0  0  | 0.5\n|  0  1  4    | 0\n|  0  0  1    | 0\n\nSubtract 4 times the third row from the second row:\n\n|  1  0  0  | 0.5\n|  0  1  0    | 0\n|  0  0  1    | 0\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n\n|  1  0  0  | 0.5\n|  0  1  0    | 0\n|  0  0  1    | 0\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0.5, y = 0, and z = 0.\n\nNow, let's determine if the matrix is ill-conditioned. A matrix is considered ill-conditioned if it has a high condition number, which is the ratio of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value. In this case, we can calculate the condition number using the original matrix:\n\nA = |  2  3  4 |\n      |  5  7  8 |\n      | 10  9 13 |\n\nThe condition number of A is approximately 19.5, which is not very large. Therefore, the matrix is not ill-conditioned.\n\nAn ill-conditioned matrix can cause numerical instability and inaccurate results when solving linear systems, especially when using floating-point arithmetic. If the matrix were ill-conditioned, one possible solution would be to use a more stable algorithm, such as the QR decomposition or the singular value decomposition (SVD), to solve the system of linear equations."
