    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 150 and 270 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (270) by the smaller number (150) and find the remainder.\n   270 รท 150 = 1 with a remainder of 120.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (270) with the smaller number (150) and the smaller number with the remainder (120) from the previous step.\n   Now we have to find the GCD of 150 and 120.\n\n3. Repeat the process:\n   150 รท 120 = 1 with a remainder of 30.\n\n4. Replace the numbers again:\n   Now we have to find the GCD of 120 and 30.\n\n5. Repeat the process:\n   120 รท 30 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 30. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 150 and 270 is 30."
