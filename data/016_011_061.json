    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-similar fractal that can be constructed through an iterative process. In each iteration, the scaling factor is 3, as each square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and 5 of them are kept.\n\nTo find the scaling factor after 5 iterations, we simply raise the scaling factor of a single iteration to the power of the number of iterations:\n\nScaling factor = (scaling factor of a single iteration) ^ (number of iterations)\nScaling factor = 3^5\nScaling factor = 243\n\nSo, the scaling factor of the Vicsek fractal when iterated 5 times is 243."
