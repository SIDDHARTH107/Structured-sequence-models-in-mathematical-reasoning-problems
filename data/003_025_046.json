    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity vector, we can use trigonometry to break down the velocity into its north and east components. Since the boat is traveling north-east, it is moving at a 45-degree angle with respect to the north and east directions.\n\nLet V_north be the north component of the velocity and V_east be the east component of the velocity. We can use the sine and cosine functions to find these components:\n\nV_north = V * sin(45°)\nV_east = V * cos(45°)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the velocity vector (20 km/hr in this case).\n\nSince sin(45°) = cos(45°) = √2 / 2:\n\nV_north = 20 * (√2 / 2) = 10√2 km/hr\nV_east = 20 * (√2 / 2) = 10√2 km/hr\n\nNow we can find the magnitude of the velocity vector using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV = √(V_north^2 + V_east^2)\nV = √((10√2)^2 + (10√2)^2)\nV = √(200 + 200)\nV = √400\nV = 20 km/hr\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector is 20 km/hr, which is the same as the given speed since the boat is moving in a straight line.\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector can be found using the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(V_north / V_east)\nθ = arctan(10√2 / 10√2)\nθ = arctan(1)\nθ = 45°\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector is 45°, which is north-east as given in the problem."
