    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 3 people is playing the Public Goods Game where each person has an endowment of $10. The group has a total of $30 in endowments. Each round, each person decides whether to keep their endowment or to contribute it to a public pot. The contributions are then multiplied by a factor of 2 and equally distributed among all players. For example, if all three players contribute, the public pot will be $30, and each person will receive $20 ($10 endowment + $10 from the public pot) for a total of $60.\n\nAssuming all players are rational and self-interested, what is the Nash equilibrium in terms of contribution levels?",
    "message_2": "In the Public Goods Game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when all players contribute $0 to the public pot.\n\nTo understand why, let's consider the possible outcomes for a rational, self-interested player:\n\n1. If the other two players contribute $10 each, the public pot will be $20. After the 2x multiplier, the pot will be $40, and each player will receive $13.33. In this case, the rational player would prefer to keep their $10 endowment, as $10 > $13.33 - $10 = $3.33.\n\n2. If one of the other players contributes $10 and the other contributes $0, the public pot will be $10. After the 2x multiplier, the pot will be $20, and each player will receive $6.67. In this case, the rational player would still prefer to keep their $10 endowment, as $10 > $6.67.\n\n3. If both other players contribute $0, the public pot will be $0, and there will be no additional money to distribute. In this case, the rational player would have no incentive to contribute, as they would receive nothing in return.\n\nIn all scenarios, the rational, self-interested player has no incentive to contribute to the public pot. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is when all players contribute $0."
