The risk-free interest rate is 1%. The Black-Scholes equation for a call option is given by:\n\n$$C(S,t) = S\\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)} \\Phi(d_2)$$\n\nWhere:\n- $C(S,t)$ is the call option price at time $t$\n- $S$ is the underlying stock price\n- $K$ is the strike price\n- $r$ is the risk-free interest rate\n- $T$ is the time to maturity\n- $\\Phi(z)$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function\n- $d_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\frac{S}{K} + \\left(r+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}$\n- $d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}$\n\nCalculate the call option price at time $t = 0$.",
    "message_2": "Given the parameters:\n\n- Strike price (K) = $50\n- Maturity (T) = 1 year\n- Underlying stock price (S) = $48\n- Volatility (σ) = 0.3\n- Risk-free interest rate (r) = 1% = 0.01\n\nWe want to calculate the call option price at time t = 0. First, we need to find d1 and d2:\n\n$$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\frac{S}{K} + \\left(r+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}$$\n$$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}$$\n\nAt t = 0:\n\n$$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\frac{48}{50} + \\left(0.01+\\frac{0.3^2}{2}\\right)(1-0)}{0.3\\sqrt{1-0}}$$\n$$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\frac{48}{50} + \\left(0.01+\\frac{0.09}{2}\\right)}{0.3}$$\n$$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln0.96 + 0.055}{0.3}$$\n$$d_1 ≈ -0.041$$\n\nNow, calculate d2:\n\n$$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}$$\n$$d_2 = -0.041 - 0.3\\sqrt{1}$$\n$$d_2 ≈ -0.341$$\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes equation to find the call option price:\n\n$$C(S,t) = S\\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)} \\Phi(d_2)$$\n\nAt t = 0:\n\n$$C(48,0) = 48\\Phi(-0.041) - 50e^{-0.01(1-0)} \\Phi(-0.341)$$\n\nUsing a standard normal cumulative distribution function calculator or table, we find:\n\n$$\\Phi(-0.041) ≈ 0.484$$\n$$\\Phi(-0.341) ≈ 0.367$$\n\nNow, plug these values back into the equation:\n\n$$C(48,0) = 48(0.484) - 50e^{-0.01} (0.367)$$\n$$C(48,0) ≈ 23.232 - 49.502(0.367)$$\n$$C(48,0) ≈ 23.232 - 18.162$$\n$$C(48,0) ≈ 5.07$$\n\nTherefore, the call option price at time t = 0 is approximately $5.07."
