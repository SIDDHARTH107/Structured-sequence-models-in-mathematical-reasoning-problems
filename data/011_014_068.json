    "message_2": "A simple graph with 6 nodes can have at most 5+4+3+2+1 = 15 edges (complete graph). Since the graph has 9 edges, it is not a complete graph. \n\nA connected component is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by a path, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph. \n\nIn this case, we have 6 nodes and 9 edges. To determine the number of connected components, we can use the fact that a tree (a connected graph with no cycles) has n-1 edges, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nLet's assume that the graph has only one connected component. In this case, the graph would be a tree with 6 nodes, which would require 6-1=5 edges. However, we have 9 edges, which means there must be cycles in the graph, and it cannot be a tree.\n\nNow, let's assume that the graph has two connected components. In this case, we can have one component with 4 nodes and the other with 2 nodes. The component with 4 nodes would require 4-1=3 edges, and the component with 2 nodes would require 2-1=1 edge. In total, we would have 3+1=4 edges, which is less than the 9 edges we have.\n\nTherefore, the graph must have at least three connected components. Let's assume that the graph has three connected components. We can have one component with 3 nodes, another with 2 nodes, and the last one with 1 node. The component with 3 nodes would require 3-1=2 edges, the component with 2 nodes would require 2-1=1 edge, and the component with 1 node would require 0 edges. In total, we would have 2+1+0=3 edges, which is less than the 9 edges we have.\n\nThus, it is not possible for the graph to have 6 nodes, 9 edges, and be a simple graph. There must be an error in the problem statement or a misunderstanding of the graph's properties."
