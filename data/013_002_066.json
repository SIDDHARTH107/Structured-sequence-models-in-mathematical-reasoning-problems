The payoffs for each player in different scenarios are shown in the table below:\n\n|            |     X     |     Y     |     Z     |\n|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|\n| **A** | (5, 2) | (1, 1) | (3, 3) |\n| **B** | (0, 3) | (2, 4) | (1, 2) |\n\nDetermine the Nash equilibrium (if any) of the game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best responses for each player given the other player's strategy. \n\nFor Player 1:\n- If Player 2 chooses X, Player 1's best response is A (5 > 0).\n- If Player 2 chooses Y, Player 1's best response is B (2 > 1).\n- If Player 2 chooses Z, Player 1's best response is A (3 > 1).\n\nFor Player 2:\n- If Player 1 chooses A, Player 2's best response is X (2 > 1 and 2 > 3).\n- If Player 1 chooses B, Player 2's best response is Y (4 > 3 and 4 > 2).\n\nNow, we look for the strategy combinations where both players are playing their best responses:\n\n- (A, X): Player 1's best response to X is A, and Player 2's best response to A is X.\n- (B, Y): Player 1's best response to Y is B, and Player 2's best response to B is Y.\n\nThus, there are two Nash equilibria in this game: (A, X) and (B, Y)."
