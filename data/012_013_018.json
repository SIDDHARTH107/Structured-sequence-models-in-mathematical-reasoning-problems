    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted as P(G, k), is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of G. A proper k-coloring is an assignment of k colors to the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFor a complete graph K_n with n vertices, every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. Therefore, when coloring the first vertex, we have k choices of colors. For the second vertex, we have (k-1) choices since it cannot have the same color as the first vertex. For the third vertex, we have (k-2) choices, and so on. \n\nSo, for a complete graph K_n, the chromatic polynomial is given by:\n\nP(K_n, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1)\n\nNow, we want to find the chromatic polynomial of a complete graph K_5. Plugging n=5 into the formula, we get:\n\nP(K_5, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the complete graph K_5."
