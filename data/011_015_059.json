    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of Ramsey numbers. A Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer such that any group of R(m, n) people will always have either m people who have all shaken hands with each other (mutual acquaintances) or n people who have all not shaken hands with each other (mutual strangers).\n\nIn this case, we are looking for R(3, 3), which is the smallest number of people in a group such that there are either 3 mutual acquaintances or 3 mutual strangers.\n\nLet's consider a group of 6 people (A, B, C, D, E, F). We will use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem.\n\n1. Start with person A. They can either shake hands with someone or not shake hands with someone. Since there are 5 other people in the group, person A will have either shaken hands with at least 3 people or not shaken hands with at least 3 people.\n\n2. Let's assume person A has shaken hands with at least 3 people (without loss of generality). Let these 3 people be B, C, and D.\n\n3. Now, consider the relationships between B, C, and D. There are 3 possible handshakes between them: B-C, B-D, and C-D.\n\n4. If any one of these handshakes occurs (e.g., B-C), then we have a group of 3 mutual acquaintances (A, B, and C). If none of these handshakes occur, then B, C, and D form a group of 3 mutual strangers.\n\nThus, the minimum number of handshakes that must occur for there to be either three people who have all shaken hands with each other or three people who have all not shaken hands with each other is R(3, 3) = 6."
