The transfer function of each filter is given by:\nH1(w) = 2cos(4w)\nH2(w) = sin(2w)\nH3(w) = 3cos(6w)\nH4(w) = sin(4w)\nH5(w) = 4cos(8w)\nH6(w) = sin(6w)\n\nUse the Fourier transform to determine the overall frequency response of the network and calculate the magnitude and phase response at the frequency of 3 Hz (i.e., w = 6π).",
    "message_2": "To determine the overall frequency response of the network, we need to multiply the transfer functions of each filter since they are connected in series:\n\nH(w) = H1(w) * H2(w) * H3(w) * H4(w) * H5(w) * H6(w)\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnitude and phase response at the frequency of 3 Hz (i.e., w = 6π).\n\nH(6π) = H1(6π) * H2(6π) * H3(6π) * H4(6π) * H5(6π) * H6(6π)\n\nH1(6π) = 2cos(4 * 6π) = 2cos(24π) = 2\nH2(6π) = sin(2 * 6π) = sin(12π) = 0\nH3(6π) = 3cos(6 * 6π) = 3cos(36π) = 3\nH4(6π) = sin(4 * 6π) = sin(24π) = 0\nH5(6π) = 4cos(8 * 6π) = 4cos(48π) = 4\nH6(6π) = sin(6 * 6π) = sin(36π) = 0\n\nH(6π) = 2 * 0 * 3 * 0 * 4 * 0 = 0\n\nThe overall frequency response of the network at 3 Hz (w = 6π) is 0. Since the magnitude response is 0, there is no need to calculate the phase response as it will not affect the output signal. The network completely attenuates the signal at 3 Hz."
