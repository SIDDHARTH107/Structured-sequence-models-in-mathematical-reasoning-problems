    "message_2": "To find the cardinality of the set of all subsets of a given set S with n elements, we use the power set concept. The power set of a set S is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and the set itself. The cardinality of the power set of S is denoted as |P(S)|.\n\nUsing second-order logic, we can express the power set of S as follows:\n\n∀X (X ∈ P(S) ↔ ∀Y (Y ∈ X → Y ∈ S))\n\nThis means that a set X is a member of the power set of S if and only if every element Y in X is also an element of S.\n\nNow, to find the cardinality of the power set of S, we use the formula:\n\n|P(S)| = 2^n\n\nwhere n is the number of elements in the set S.\n\nSo, the cardinality of the set of all subsets of a given set S with n elements, including the empty and full sets, is 2^n."
