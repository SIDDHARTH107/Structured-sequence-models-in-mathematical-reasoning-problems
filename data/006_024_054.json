    "message_1": "A group of 10 friends is planning a road trip. The probability of any one of them experiencing car sickness on the trip is 0.3. What is the probability that at least 3 of them will experience car sickness during the trip?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 3 of them will experience car sickness during the trip, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, k friends experiencing car sickness)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 10 friends)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of friends experiencing car sickness)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.3)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.7)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 3 of them will experience car sickness, we need to find the probability of 3, 4, 5, ..., 10 friends experiencing car sickness and sum them up. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + ... + P(X = 10)\n\nCalculating each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * 0.3^3 * 0.7^7 ≈ 0.2668\nP(X = 4) = C(10, 4) * 0.3^4 * 0.7^6 ≈ 0.2001\nP(X = 5) = C(10, 5) * 0.3^5 * 0.7^5 ≈ 0.1029\nP(X = 6) = C(10, 6) * 0.3^6 * 0.7^4 ≈ 0.0368\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.3^7 * 0.7^3 ≈ 0.0090\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.3^8 * 0.7^2 ≈ 0.0014\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.3^9 * 0.7^1 ≈ 0.0001\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.3^10 * 0.7^0 ≈ 0.0000\n\nSumming up these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 0.2668 + 0.2001 + 0.1029 + 0.0368 + 0.0090 + 0.0014 + 0.0001 + 0.0000 ≈ 0.6171\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 of them will experience car sickness during the trip is approximately 0.6171 or 61.71%."
