    "message_1": "A company has recorded that, on average, 10% of their online orders are submitted between 4 pm and 6 pm. If the company receives 50 orders online today, what is the probability that exactly 7 of them were submitted between 4 pm and 6 pm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, orders between 4 pm and 6 pm) in n trials (total orders)\n- n choose k is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 10% or 0.1)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, 90% or 0.9)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 50 orders)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (in this case, 7 orders)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 7) = (50 choose 7) * 0.1^7 * 0.9^(50-7)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 50 choose 7:\n\n50! / (7!(50-7)!) = 50! / (7!43!) = 50 * 49 * 48 * 47 * 46 * 45 * 44 / (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 99,884,400 / 5,040 = 19,884\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\n0.1^7 * 0.9^(50-7) = 0.1^7 * 0.9^43 ≈ 0.0000001 * 0.0000305 ≈ 0.00000000305\n\nFinally, multiply the two results:\n\nP(X = 7) = 19,884 * 0.00000000305 ≈ 0.0606\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 7 orders were submitted between 4 pm and 6 pm is approximately 6.06%."
