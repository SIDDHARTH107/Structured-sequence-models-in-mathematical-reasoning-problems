    "message_2": "The given quadratic equation is in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a = 2, b = -8, and c = 3.\n\n1. Vertex: The vertex of a parabola can be found using the formula (h, k), where h = -b/(2a) and k = f(h). \n\nh = -(-8) / (2 * 2) = 8 / 4 = 2\nk = f(2) = 2(2)^2 - 8(2) + 3 = 8 - 16 + 3 = -5\n\nSo, the vertex is (2, -5).\n\n2. Axis of symmetry: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. Its equation is x = h. In this case, the axis of symmetry is x = 2.\n\n3. Direction of the parabola: Since the coefficient a = 2 is positive, the parabola opens up.\n\nIn summary, the vertex of the parabola is (2, -5), the axis of symmetry is x = 2, and the parabola opens up."
