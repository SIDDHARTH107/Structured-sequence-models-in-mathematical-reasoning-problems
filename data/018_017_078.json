To do this, we first need to find the Cartesian product of A with itself, denoted as A × A:\n\nA × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A × B and A × A, denoted as (A × B) △ (A × A):\n\n(A × B) △ (A × A) = {(1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of (A × B) △ (A × A) and A × (B △ A):\n\n((A × B) △ (A × A)) △ (A × (B △ A)) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the results of (A × B) △ A and A × (B △ A):\n\n(A × B) △ A = {(1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\nA × (B △ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, which means that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
