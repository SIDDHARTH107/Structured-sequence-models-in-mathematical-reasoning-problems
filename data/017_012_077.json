    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, we will use the Sylow theorems and properties of p-groups.\n\nFirst, note that 16 = 2^4, so G is a p-group with p = 2. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we know that n_2 must divide the order of G, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Since the order of G is 16, the only possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 16. However, if n_2 = 16, then there would be 15 distinct non-identity elements of order 2 in G, which is impossible since a group of order 16 can have at most 8 elements of order 2. Therefore, n_2 = 1, and G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\nLet H be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since H is normal and has order 8, G/H has order 2. By the correspondence theorem, there is a subgroup K of G such that K/H is cyclic of order 2. Then, K has order 4 and is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/K. Since G has order 16 and K has order 4, G/K has order 4. Since the order of G/K is a power of 2, G/K is abelian. By the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem, G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the direct product of K and G/K, which are both abelian groups. Therefore, G must also be abelian.\n\nSince G is an abelian group of order 16, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C2 × C2 × C2 × C2. We can eliminate the last three possibilities by noting that G has a unique subgroup of order 8 (the Sylow 2-subgroup H), while each of these groups has more than one subgroup of order 8. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C16.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16. The dihedral group D8 and the non-abelian group of order 16 are not isomorphic to G, as G is abelian and these groups are non-abelian."
