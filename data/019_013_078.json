    "message_1": "Let S be the set of integers from 1 to 10. Find the number of subsets of S that contain either exactly one odd number or exactly two even numbers in second-order logic.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will break it down into two cases: subsets with exactly one odd number and subsets with exactly two even numbers. We will then find the number of subsets for each case and add them together.\n\nCase 1: Subsets with exactly one odd number\nThere are 5 odd numbers in the set S (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). We will choose one of these odd numbers and then choose any combination of even numbers from the set. There are 5 even numbers in the set S (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), so we have 2^5 = 32 subsets for each odd number. Since there are 5 odd numbers, the total number of subsets with exactly one odd number is 5 * 32 = 160.\n\nCase 2: Subsets with exactly two even numbers\nThere are 5 even numbers in the set S, and we want to choose exactly two of them. We can do this in C(5, 2) = 10 ways. For each of these combinations of two even numbers, we can choose any combination of odd numbers from the set. There are 5 odd numbers in the set S, so we have 2^5 = 32 subsets for each combination of two even numbers. The total number of subsets with exactly two even numbers is 10 * 32 = 320.\n\nAdding the number of subsets from both cases, we get 160 + 320 = 480. Therefore, there are 480 subsets of S that contain either exactly one odd number or exactly two even numbers."
