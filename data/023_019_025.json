    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the system described by the given equation, we will first apply the Fourier transform to the equation. The Fourier transform of a function $u(x, t)$ is defined as:\n\n$$\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x, t) e^{-ikx} dx$$\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to the given equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}}{\\partial x^2}$$\n\nNow, we will assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}_0(k) e^{\\lambda t}$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a complex number and $\\hat{u}_0(k)$ is the initial condition in the Fourier space. Substituting this into the transformed equation, we get:\n\n$$\\lambda \\hat{u}_0(k) e^{\\lambda t} = k(-k^2) \\hat{u}_0(k) e^{\\lambda t}$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\hat{u}_0(k) e^{\\lambda t}$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\lambda = -k^3$$\n\nNow, we will analyze the stability of the system. The system is stable if the real part of $\\lambda$ is negative, and unstable if the real part of $\\lambda$ is positive.\n\n1. If $k > 0$, then $\\lambda = -k^3 < 0$, so the system is stable.\n2. If $k < 0$, then $\\lambda = -k^3 > 0$, so the system is unstable.\n\nTherefore, the system is stable for $k > 0$ and unstable for $k < 0$."
