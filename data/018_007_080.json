    "message_2": "A power set is the set of all possible subsets of a given set, including the empty set and the set itself. Let's denote the power set of A as P(A).\n\nIn this case, A = {2, 3, 5}. To find the power set of A, we need to list all possible subsets of A:\n\n1. The empty set: {}\n2. Single-element subsets: {2}, {3}, {5}\n3. Two-element subsets: {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 5}\n4. Three-element subset: {2, 3, 5}\n\nSo, P(A) = { {}, {2}, {3}, {5}, {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 5}, {2, 3, 5} }\n\nNow, let's compare the sizes of A and P(A). The size of a set is the number of elements it contains.\n\n|A| = 3 (since A has 3 elements: 2, 3, and 5)\n|P(A)| = 8 (since P(A) has 8 subsets)\n\nSince |P(A)| = 8 and |A| = 3, it is clear that the power set of A is larger than A itself. In general, for any set A with n elements, the size of its power set P(A) is 2^n. In this case, n = 3, so the size of the power set is 2^3 = 8."
