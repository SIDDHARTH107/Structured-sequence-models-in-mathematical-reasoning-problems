    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Sierpinski pyramid or Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration or level, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nFor a Sierpinski tetrahedron of 3 levels, we can calculate the total number of tetrahedra using the formula:\n\nTotal tetrahedra = (4^0) + (4^1) + (4^2)\n\nTotal tetrahedra = 1 + 4 + 16\n\nTotal tetrahedra = 21\n\nSo, a Sierpinski tetrahedron of 3 levels requires a total of 21 tetrahedra."
