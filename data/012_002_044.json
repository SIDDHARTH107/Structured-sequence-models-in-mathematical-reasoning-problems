    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number, we will color the vertices in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color and use the minimum number of colors possible.\n\nWe can start by coloring vertex A with color 1:\n\n```\n    1(A) --- B\n   /        / \n  C --- D --- E\n```\n\nNow, we can color vertex B with color 2 since it is adjacent to vertex A:\n\n```\n    1(A) --- 2(B)\n   /        / \n  C --- D --- E\n```\n\nNext, we can color vertex C with color 2 since it is not adjacent to vertex B:\n\n```\n    1(A) --- 2(B)\n   /        / \n  2(C) --- D --- E\n```\n\nNow, we need to color vertex D. Since it is adjacent to vertices A, B, and C, we need to use a new color, color 3:\n\n```\n    1(A) --- 2(B)\n   /        / \n  2(C) --- 3(D) --- E\n```\n\nFinally, we can color vertex E with color 1 since it is only adjacent to vertex D:\n\n```\n    1(A) --- 2(B)\n   /        / \n  2(C) --- 3(D) --- 1(E)\n```\n\nWe have used 3 colors in total, and no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of the given graph is 3."
