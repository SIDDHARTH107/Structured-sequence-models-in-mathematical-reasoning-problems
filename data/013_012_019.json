Let's assume that there are two companies (Company A and Company B), and Company A is the leader. Company A can produce a good at a cost of $20 per unit while Company B can produce the same good at a cost of $30 per unit. Company A's demand function is Qd = 500 - 2P and Company B's demand function is Qd = 300 - P, where Qd is the quantity demanded and P is the price. What quantity and price will the leader (Company A) produce and sell in this market? What is the best response of the follower (Company B)?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the reaction functions for both companies. To do this, we need to find the profit-maximizing quantity for each company, given the other company's production level. \n\nCompany A's profit function is given by:\nΠ_A = (P - 20) * Q_A\n\nSubstitute the demand function for P:\nΠ_A = ((500 - 2 * Q_A) - 20) * Q_A\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order condition (FOC) for profit maximization by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_A and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Π_A)/dQ_A = 500 - 4 * Q_A - 20 = 0\n\nSolve for Q_A:\nQ_A = (500 - 20) / 4 = 120\n\nNow, we need to find Company B's reaction function. Company B's profit function is given by:\nΠ_B = (P - 30) * Q_B\n\nSubstitute the demand function for P:\nΠ_B = ((300 - Q_B) - 30) * Q_B\n\nTake the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_B and set it equal to 0:\nd(Π_B)/dQ_B = 300 - 2 * Q_B - 30 = 0\n\nSolve for Q_B:\nQ_B = (300 - 30) / 2 = 135\n\nNow, we need to find the equilibrium quantities for both companies. Since Company A is the leader, we will plug its optimal quantity (Q_A = 120) into Company B's demand function to find the equilibrium price:\n\nP = 300 - Q_B = 300 - 135 = 165\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium quantity for Company B by plugging the equilibrium price into its reaction function:\n\nQ_B = 300 - P = 300 - 165 = 135\n\nSo, in this Stackelberg competition, Company A (the leader) will produce and sell 120 units at a price of $165 per unit. Company B (the follower) will produce and sell 135 units in response to Company A's production level."
