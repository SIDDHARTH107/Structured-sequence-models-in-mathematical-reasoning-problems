    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle O_X(2), we first need to find the homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 that vanish on X.\n\nThe equation x^2 + y^2 - 4z^2 = 0 defines a smooth quadric surface in P^2. The line bundle O_X(2) corresponds to homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 in the coordinates x, y, and z. The general form of such a polynomial is:\n\nF(x, y, z) = ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + dxy + exz + fyz\n\nWe want to find the dimension of the space of such polynomials F(x, y, z) that vanish on X, i.e., F(x, y, z) = 0 for all (x, y, z) in X.\n\nSince X is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 - 4z^2 = 0, we have:\n\nF(x, y, z) = a(x^2 + y^2 - 4z^2) + dxy + exz + fyz = 0\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n(ax + dy + ez)(x + y + fz) = 4az^2\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get the following system of equations:\n\na + d + e = 0\na + d + f = 0\n-4a + e + f = 4\n\nSolving this system, we find that a = 1, d = -1, e = 0, and f = 0. Therefore, the only homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 that vanishes on X is:\n\nF(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - 4z^2\n\nSince this is a one-dimensional space, the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle O_X(2) is 1."
