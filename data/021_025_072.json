    "message_1": "Suppose an engineering firm needs to optimize the design of a bridge truss with 10 components. The maximum stress each component can handle is 100 MPa. The weight of each component ranges from 200 kg to 800 kg. The objective is to minimize the total weight of the truss while ensuring that the stress on each component remains below the maximum allowable stress. Use Whale Optimization Algorithm to solve the optimization problem and find the weight of each component that minimizes the total weight of the truss.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales (solutions) randomly within the search space (weights between 200 kg and 800 kg for each of the 10 components).\n\n2. Define the objective function: Minimize the total weight of the truss while ensuring that the stress on each component remains below the maximum allowable stress (100 MPa).\n\n3. Set the maximum number of iterations (for example, 100).\n\n4. Start the WOA algorithm:\n\n   a. For each iteration, update the position of each whale according to the WOA equations, considering the best solution found so far.\n   \n   b. Calculate the objective function for each whale and update the best solution if a better one is found.\n   \n   c. Check if the stress constraint is satisfied for each component in the solution. If not, penalize the solution or discard it.\n   \n   d. Repeat steps a-c until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n5. The best solution found after the maximum number of iterations is the optimized weight of each component that minimizes the total weight of the truss while satisfying the stress constraint.\n\nPlease note that as an AI language model, I cannot execute the Whale Optimization Algorithm directly. However, you can implement the WOA in a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or any other suitable language to solve this optimization problem."
