    "message_2": "To find the vertex and the axis of symmetry of the quadratic function f(x) = 2x² + 4x - 5, we can use the vertex formula for a parabola in the form of f(x) = ax² + bx + c, which is:\n\nVertex: (h, k) = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -5.\n\nFirst, let's find the x-coordinate of the vertex (h):\n\nh = -b / 2a = -4 / (2 * 2) = -4 / 4 = -1\n\nNow, let's find the y-coordinate of the vertex (k) by plugging h into the function:\n\nk = f(-1) = 2(-1)² + 4(-1) - 5 = 2(1) - 4 - 5 = 2 - 4 - 5 = -7\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic function is (-1, -7).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, and its equation is given by:\n\nx = h\n\nIn this case, the axis of symmetry is:\n\nx = -1"
