    "message_2": "To find the volume of water in the tank when it is half-full, we can use the method of integration. We will integrate the area of the circular cross-sections of the tank along the height of the tank, from 0 to half of the height (5 meters).\n\nThe equation for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the radius of the tank is constant (5 meters), the area of each circular cross-section is A = π(5^2) = 25π square meters.\n\nNow, we will integrate the area along the height of the tank from 0 to 5 meters:\n\nVolume = ∫[A(h) dh] from 0 to 5\nVolume = ∫[25π dh] from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we will integrate:\n\nVolume = [25πh] from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nVolume = (25π(5)) - (25π(0))\nVolume = 125π - 0\nVolume = 125π cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of water in the tank when it is half-full is 125π cubic meters."
