    "message_2": "A generator of a group of prime order 7 is an element that generates all the non-identity elements of the group when raised to successive powers. In other words, if the group is G and the generator is g, then the elements {g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6} are all distinct and form the non-identity elements of G.\n\nFor example, in the multiplicative group of integers modulo 7, denoted as (Z/7Z)*, the generators are 3 and 5. This is because:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n3^2 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n3^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n3^4 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3^5 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n3^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nand\n\n5^1 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n5^2 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n5^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n5^4 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n5^5 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the generators of a group of prime order 7 are 3 and 5 in the case of the multiplicative group of integers modulo 7. Note that the specific generators may vary depending on the group in question."
