    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^3 - 4z = 0\n\nWe can factor out a z from the expression:\n\nz(z^2 - 4) = 0\n\nNow we can see that z = 0 is a zero of the function. The other zeros can be found by solving the quadratic equation z^2 - 4 = 0:\n\nz^2 = 4\nz = Â±2\n\nSo, the zeros of the function f(z) are z = 0, z = 2, and z = -2.\n\nTo find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz - 2 = 0\nz = 2\n\nHowever, since z = 2 is also a zero of the function, it cancels out the pole, and there are no poles for this function.\n\nIn summary, the zeros of the function f(z) are z = 0, z = 2, and z = -2, and there are no poles."
