    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = y^2 - x^2$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient of a function is given by the partial derivatives with respect to each variable. In this case, we need to find the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -2x$$\n\nThe partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$$-2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$$\n$$2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$$\n\nThus, the only critical point of the function $f(x, y) = y^2 - x^2$ is $(0, 0)$."
