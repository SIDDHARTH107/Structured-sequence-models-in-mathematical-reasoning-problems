    "message_1": "In a beauty contest game, there are three players who must choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner will be the player whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all three numbers. If there is a tie, the player who chose the lower number wins. What number should you choose to maximize your chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning, you should choose a number that is two-thirds of the expected average of the other players' numbers. \n\nAssuming the other players choose their numbers randomly between 0 and 100, the expected average of their numbers would be the midpoint of the range, which is (0 + 100) / 2 = 50. \n\nNow, you should choose a number that is two-thirds of this expected average:\n\n(2/3) * 50 = 100 / 3 â‰ˆ 33.33\n\nHowever, since you win ties by choosing a lower number, you should choose the integer value just below 33.33, which is 33. \n\nSo, you should choose 33 to maximize your chances of winning."
