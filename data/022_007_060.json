    "message_2": "First, let's recall the statements of Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra:\n\nLiouville's theorem: Every bounded entire function (i.e., a holomorphic function defined on the entire complex plane) is constant.\n\nFundamental theorem of algebra: Every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomial function $f(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 - 3z + 10$. This is a non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients (in fact, it has real coefficients, which are a subset of complex coefficients). By the fundamental theorem of algebra, there exists a complex number $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $f(c) = 0$.\n\nWe don't need to use Liouville's theorem in this case, as the fundamental theorem of algebra directly gives us the result we want. However, it's worth noting that Liouville's theorem is used in the proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, which is why it might have been mentioned in the problem statement."
