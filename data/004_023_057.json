    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y=x^2 and y=x, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting y=x^2 equal to y=x:\n\nx^2 = x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 - x = 0\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two solutions: x=0 and x=1. These are the points of intersection between the two curves. Now, we can set up an integral to find the area between the curves:\n\nArea = âˆ«(x - x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we first find the antiderivative of (x - x^2):\n\nAntiderivative = (1/2)x^2 - (1/3)x^3\n\nNow, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the area:\n\nArea = [(1/2)(1)^2 - (1/3)(1)^3] - [(1/2)(0)^2 - (1/3)(0)^3]\nArea = (1/2 - 1/3) - (0)\nArea = 1/6\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y=x^2 and y=x is 1/6 square units."
