    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a circular cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nGiven the height (h) is 10 cm and the radius (r) is 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(4²)(10)\nVolume = (1/3)π(16)(10)\nVolume = (1/3)π(160)\n\nNow, we can multiply the values:\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(160)\nVolume ≈ (1.047197)(160)\nVolume ≈ 167.55168 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the circular cone is approximately 167.55 cm³."
