Sylow 2-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Therefore, n_2 can be either 1 or 9. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, which must be normal in G. If n_2 = 9, then there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Therefore, n_3 can be either 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9, which must be normal in G. If n_3 = 4, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G based on these Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is C4 × C9. This group is abelian, so it is not the group we are looking for.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9. Let P_3 be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is normal in G, the product P_2P_3 is a subgroup of G with order 4 * 9 = 36, so G = P_2P_3. The intersection of P_2 and P_3 is trivial, and G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. Since P_3 is isomorphic to C9, it has an automorphism group Aut(P_3) isomorphic to C6. P_2 is isomorphic to C4 or C2 × C2, and in either case, it has a nontrivial automorphism. Therefore, there exists a nontrivial homomorphism from P_2 to Aut(P_3), which defines a non-abelian semidirect product G = P_2 ⋊ P_3. This group is not isomorphic to C36 or A4 × C3, so it is the group we are looking for.\n\nThus, there exists a non-abelian group of order 36 that is isomorphic to neither the cyclic group C36 nor the alternating group A4 × C3."
