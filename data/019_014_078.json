    "message_2": "To prove that the function f(x) = x + 1 is injective over the natural numbers, we need to show that for any two natural numbers a and b, if f(a) = f(b), then a = b.\n\nAssume f(a) = f(b) for some natural numbers a and b. By the definition of the function f, we have:\n\na + 1 = f(a) = f(b) = b + 1\n\nNow, we can use the properties of natural numbers and the cancellation law for addition:\n\na + 1 = b + 1 implies a = b (by the cancellation law)\n\nThus, we have shown that if f(a) = f(b), then a = b, which means the function f(x) = x + 1 is injective over the natural numbers."
