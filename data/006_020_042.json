    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 60% of them are males and 40% are females. If you randomly select 3 people from the community, what is the probability that at least 2 of them are females?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the number of males and females in the community. There are 60% males and 40% females.\n\nNumber of males = 60% of 500 = 0.6 * 500 = 300\nNumber of females = 40% of 500 = 0.4 * 500 = 200\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of selecting at least 2 females out of 3 people. There are two possible scenarios: selecting exactly 2 females and 1 male, or selecting all 3 females.\n\n1. Probability of selecting exactly 2 females and 1 male:\n(200/500) * (199/499) * (300/498) * 3!/(2!1!) = (200/500) * (199/499) * (300/498) * 3 = 0.399198\n\n2. Probability of selecting all 3 females:\n(200/500) * (199/499) * (198/498) = 0.132278\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two scenarios to find the probability of selecting at least 2 females:\n\nProbability (at least 2 females) = Probability (exactly 2 females) + Probability (all 3 females) = 0.399198 + 0.132278 = 0.531476\n\nSo, the probability of selecting at least 2 females out of 3 people is approximately 0.531 or 53.1%."
