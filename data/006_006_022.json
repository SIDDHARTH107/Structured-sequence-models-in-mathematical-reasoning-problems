    "message_1": "In a basketball game, a player has a 60% chance of making a free throw. If he takes 10 free throw shots, what is the probability that he will make exactly 7 shots?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of making exactly k shots\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of shots (in this case, 10)\n- k is the number of successful shots (in this case, 7)\n- p is the probability of making a shot (in this case, 0.6)\n- (1-p) is the probability of missing a shot (in this case, 0.4)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 successful shots out of 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / (5040 * 6)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / 30240\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = 120 * (0.6)^7 * (0.4)^3\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.0279936 * 0.064\nP(X = 7) â‰ˆ 0.2149908\n\nSo, the probability that the player will make exactly 7 shots out of 10 is approximately 21.5%."
