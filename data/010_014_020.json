Let C_n be the free abelian group generated by the set of n-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is less than or equal to n (i.e., the standard n-simplex), and let d_n : C_n → C_(n-1) denote the boundary homomorphism defined by alternating sum of face maps. \n\nFind the cohomology groups H^n(X; Z) of X with coefficients in the integers for all n.",
    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups H^n(X; Z) of X, we first need to understand the chain complex (C_n, d_n) associated with X. Since X consists of all ordered pairs (x, y) with non-negative integer coordinates, it is a countable discrete space. In particular, X is homeomorphic to the product of two copies of the discrete space of non-negative integers, X ≅ ℕ × ℕ.\n\nNow, let's consider the chain complex (C_n, d_n). For n > 1, the n-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is less than or equal to n are all of the form (0, 0, ..., 0), which means that C_n is trivial for n > 1. For n = 1, the 1-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is less than or equal to 1 are (0) and (1), so C_1 is a free abelian group generated by two elements. For n = 0, C_0 is a free abelian group generated by all the points in X.\n\nSince C_n is trivial for n > 1, the cohomology groups H^n(X; Z) are also trivial for n > 1. To compute H^0(X; Z) and H^1(X; Z), we need to analyze the boundary maps d_0 and d_1. The boundary map d_0 : C_0 → 0 is the zero map, so H^0(X; Z) = ker(d_0) / im(d_1) = C_0 / 0 ≅ C_0, which is a free abelian group generated by all the points in X.\n\nThe boundary map d_1 : C_1 → C_0 is also the zero map, as there are no non-trivial boundaries for the 1-simplices in this case. Therefore, H^1(X; Z) = ker(d_1) / im(d_2) = C_1 / 0 ≅ C_1, which is a free abelian group generated by two elements.\n\nIn summary, the cohomology groups H^n(X; Z) of X with coefficients in the integers are:\n\n- H^0(X; Z) is a free abelian group generated by all the points in X (i.e., ℕ × ℕ).\n- H^1(X; Z) is a free abelian group generated by two elements.\n- H^n(X; Z) is trivial for n > 1."
