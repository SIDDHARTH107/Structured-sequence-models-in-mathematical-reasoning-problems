    "message_2": "To find the expected number of attendees at the festival, we can multiply the probability of an individual attending the festival (0.3) by the total number of people in the community (500).\n\nExpected number of attendees = 0.3 * 500 = 150\n\nSo, the expected number of attendees at the festival is 150 people."
