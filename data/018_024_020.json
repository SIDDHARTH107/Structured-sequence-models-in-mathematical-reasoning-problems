    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the complement of this result. Next, find the symmetric difference of the complement of A and the complement of B. Show that the two results are not equal, thereby proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of elements that are not in the given set. We will assume the universal set U contains all the elements from 1 to 5.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the complement of A and the complement of B.\n\nA' = U - A = {5}\nB' = U - B = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complement of A and the complement of B.\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B')\n\nA' ∪ B' = {1, 5}\nA' ∩ B' = {}\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's compare the two results:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {2, 3, 4}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 5}\n\nThe two results are not equal, which proves that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
