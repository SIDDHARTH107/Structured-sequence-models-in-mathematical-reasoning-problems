    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2,7) for the curve y = x^2 + 3x + 2, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 3x + 2.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2 + 3x + 2)/dx = 2x + 3.\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at the point (2,7) for the curve y = x^2 + 3x + 2 is 7."
