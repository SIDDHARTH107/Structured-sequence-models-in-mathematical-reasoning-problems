    "message_2": "To determine whether the equation (A x B)' = A' x B' holds true, we first need to find the Cartesian product A x B, then find its complement. After that, we will find the complements of sets A and B, and then find their Cartesian product. Finally, we will compare the two results.\n\n1. Find A x B:\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4)}\n\n2. Find (A x B)':\nSince A x B contains ordered pairs, we need to consider the universal set U x V, where U and V are the universal sets containing A and B, respectively. Let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for simplicity. Then, (A x B)' contains all ordered pairs from U x V that are not in A x B:\n\n(A x B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5)}\n\n3. Find A' and B':\nA' = {2, 4} (complement of A in U)\nB' = {1, 3, 5} (complement of B in V)\n\n4. Find A' x B':\nA' x B' = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, we compare (A x B)' and A' x B':\n\n(A x B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5)}\n\nA' x B' = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)}\n\nSince (A x B)' â‰  A' x B', the equation does not hold true."
