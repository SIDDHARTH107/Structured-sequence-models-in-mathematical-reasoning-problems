    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve related to survival analysis:\n\nSuppose the probability of a machine surviving for 4 months after installation is 0.8. If 100 identical machines are installed, what is the probability that at least 70 of the machines will survive for 4 months or more?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, machines surviving for 4 months or more)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 100 machines)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 70 machines surviving)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.8)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.2)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 70 machines will survive, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities from k=70 to k=100:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 70 to 100\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = Σ [C(100, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(100-k)] for k = 70 to 100\n\nNow, we can calculate the individual probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) ≈ 0.0057 + 0.0161 + 0.0389 + ... + 0.0000 (up to k=100)\n\nP(X ≥ 70) ≈ 0.9669\n\nSo, the probability that at least 70 of the 100 machines will survive for 4 months or more is approximately 0.9669, or 96.69%."
