    "message_2": "To find the probability that exactly 300 students pass the exam, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, students passing the exam)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the total number of students, which is 500)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of students passing the exam, which is 300)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a student passing the exam, which is 60% or 0.6)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk:\n\nnCk = 500! / (300!(500-300)!)\nnCk = 500! / (300!200!)\n\nNow, let's calculate p^k:\n\np^k = 0.6^300\n\nAnd (1-p)^(n-k):\n\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.6)^(500-300) = 0.4^200\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 300) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\nP(X = 300) = (500! / (300!200!)) * (0.6^300) * (0.4^200)\n\nCalculating this value:\n\nP(X = 300) â‰ˆ 0.0014\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 300 students pass the exam is approximately 0.0014 or 0.14%."
