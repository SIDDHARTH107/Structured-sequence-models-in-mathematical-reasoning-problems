    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)² + 2π(5)(10)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(25) + 2π(50)\n\nSurface Area = 50π + 100π\n\nSurface Area = 150π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 150 * 3.14\n\nSurface Area ≈ 471 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 471 cm²."
