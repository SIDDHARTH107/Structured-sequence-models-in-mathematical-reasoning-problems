    "message_2": "To find the local maximum and minimum of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 6x^2 - 7x + 2 using Newton's method of optimization, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nStep 1: Find the first derivative of the function.\nf'(x) = d/dx (4x^3 - 6x^2 - 7x + 2) = 12x^2 - 12x - 7\n\nStep 2: Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n12x^2 - 12x - 7 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 12, b = -12, and c = -7.\n\nx = (12 ± √((-12)^2 - 4(12)(-7))) / (2 * 12)\nx = (12 ± √(144 + 336)) / 24\nx = (12 ± √480) / 24\n\nThe two possible x values are:\nx1 = (12 + √480) / 24\nx2 = (12 - √480) / 24\n\nStep 3: Find the second derivative of the function.\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (4x^3 - 6x^2 - 7x + 2) = 24x - 12\n\nStep 4: Use the second derivative test to determine if the critical points are local maximum, local minimum, or saddle points.\nFor x1:\nf''(x1) = 24(x1) - 12\nSince x1 is positive, f''(x1) will be positive, indicating that x1 corresponds to a local minimum.\n\nFor x2:\nf''(x2) = 24(x2) - 12\nSince x2 is negative, f''(x2) will be negative, indicating that x2 corresponds to a local maximum.\n\nStep 5: Find the local maximum and minimum values by plugging x1 and x2 back into the original function.\nLocal minimum: f(x1) = 4(x1)^3 - 6(x1)^2 - 7(x1) + 2\nLocal maximum: f(x2) = 4(x2)^3 - 6(x2)^2 - 7(x2) + 2\n\nSo, the local minimum occurs at x = x1 with a value of f(x1), and the local maximum occurs at x = x2 with a value of f(x2)."
