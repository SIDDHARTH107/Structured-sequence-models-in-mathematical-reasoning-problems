    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree for this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. CD (1)\n2. AE (2)\n3. AC (3)\n4. CE (3)\n5. BC (4)\n6. DE (4)\n7. AB (5)\n8. BD (6)\n\nNow, we add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add CD (1)\n2. Add AE (2)\n3. Add AC (3) - Adding this edge would create a cycle with CD and CE, so we skip it.\n4. Add CE (3)\n5. Add BC (4)\n6. Add DE (4) - Adding this edge would create a cycle with CD and CE, so we skip it.\n7. Add AB (5) - Adding this edge would create a cycle with BC and AC, so we skip it.\n8. Add BD (6) - Adding this edge would create a cycle with CD and BC, so we skip it.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree for this graph consists of the edges CD (1), AE (2), CE (3), and BC (4), with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10."
