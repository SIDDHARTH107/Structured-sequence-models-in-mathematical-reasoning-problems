    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sine function is determined by the horizontal shift of the function. In the given equation, y = 3 sin(2x + π/3), the phase shift can be found by looking at the term inside the sine function, which is (2x + π/3).\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to set the term inside the sine function equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x + π/3 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n2x = -π/3\nx = -π/6\n\nThe phase shift of the function y = 3 sin(2x + π/3) is -π/6."
