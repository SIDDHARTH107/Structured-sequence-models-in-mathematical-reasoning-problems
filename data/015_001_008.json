    "message_1": "A common measure of chaos is the Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponent of the Lorenz system is known to be approximately 0.9. Suppose you want to simulate the behavior of the system over a time span of 10 seconds with initial conditions x(0) = 1, y(0) = 2, z(0) = 3. What is the maximum error you can tolerate in your initial conditions if you want the error in your simulation to be less than 0.001 after 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (λ) measures the rate at which nearby trajectories in a dynamical system diverge. In the Lorenz system, the Lyapunov exponent is approximately 0.9. To find the maximum error tolerated in the initial conditions, we can use the following formula:\n\nError(t) = Error(0) * e^(λ * t)\n\nwhere Error(t) is the error at time t, Error(0) is the error in the initial conditions, λ is the Lyapunov exponent, and t is the time.\n\nWe want the error in our simulation to be less than 0.001 after 10 seconds, so we can set Error(t) = 0.001 and t = 10:\n\n0.001 = Error(0) * e^(0.9 * 10)\n\nNow we can solve for Error(0):\n\nError(0) = 0.001 / e^(0.9 * 10)\n\nError(0) ≈ 0.001 / e^9\n\nError(0) ≈ 0.001 / 8103.083927575384\n\nError(0) ≈ 1.2340980408667957e-7\n\nSo, the maximum error you can tolerate in your initial conditions is approximately 1.23 * 10^-7."
