    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define a universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nLet's assume U is the set of integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now, we can find the complement of set A with respect to U.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement of set A is unique. To do this, let's assume there is another complement of set A, denoted as B, such that B ≠ A'. We will show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince B is a complement of A, it must contain all the elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, B must also be equal to {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. However, this contradicts our assumption that B ≠ A'. Thus, the complement of set A is unique, and A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}."
