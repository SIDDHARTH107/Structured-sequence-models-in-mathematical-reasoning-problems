    "message_2": "A simplicial complex with 5 vertices can have a maximum of 10 possible edges, which are formed by connecting each vertex to every other vertex. In this case, we are given that the simplicial complex has 9 edges, which means it is missing one edge.\n\nA complete simplicial complex with 5 vertices (a complete graph) would form a 4-simplex, which has 5 faces, each being a tetrahedron. However, since our simplicial complex is missing one edge, it cannot form a complete 4-simplex.\n\nInstead, the simplicial complex can form a maximum of 4 tetrahedra. To see this, consider a 3-simplex (tetrahedron) formed by 4 of the vertices. The fifth vertex can be connected to 3 of the vertices of the tetrahedron, forming 3 additional tetrahedra. In this configuration, there are a total of 4 tetrahedra (faces).\n\nSo, the maximum number of faces a simplicial complex with 5 vertices and 9 edges can have is 4."
