    "message_1": "A system has 5 components. The probability of each component failing is 0.05. What is the probability that at least one component fails?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component fails, it's easier to first find the probability that none of the components fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single component not failing is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the components are independent, the probability of all 5 components not failing is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(all components not failing) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.95^5 ≈ 0.7737809375\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one component failing:\n\nP(at least one component fails) = 1 - P(all components not failing) = 1 - 0.7737809375 ≈ 0.2262190625\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component fails is approximately 0.2262 or 22.62%."
