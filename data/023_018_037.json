    "message_1": "A control system is represented by the transfer function: \n\nG(s) = (s+2)/(s^2 + 3s + 2)\n\nDetermine the frequency response of this system using the Fourier transform. Evaluate the frequency response at a frequency of 4 Hz.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we need to replace s with jω in the transfer function G(s), where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency. The frequency response G(jω) can be obtained as follows:\n\nG(jω) = (jω + 2) / ((jω)^2 + 3(jω) + 2)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the frequency response at a frequency of 4 Hz. To do this, we first convert the frequency from Hz to rad/s:\n\nω = 2πf\nω = 2π(4) = 8π rad/s\n\nNow, substitute ω = 8π into the frequency response equation:\n\nG(j(8π)) = (j(8π) + 2) / ((j(8π))^2 + 3(j(8π)) + 2)\n\nG(j(8π)) = (8πj + 2) / ((64π^2)(-1) + 24πj + 2)\n\nG(j(8π)) = (8πj + 2) / (-64π^2 + 2 + 24πj)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response:\n\nMagnitude: |G(j(8π))| = sqrt((Real part)^2 + (Imaginary part)^2)\nPhase: ∠G(j(8π)) = arctan(Imaginary part / Real part)\n\nReal part = 2 / (-64π^2 + 2)\nImaginary part = 8π / (-64π^2 + 2)\n\nMagnitude: |G(j(8π))| = sqrt((2 / (-64π^2 + 2))^2 + (8π / (-64π^2 + 2))^2)\nPhase: ∠G(j(8π)) = arctan((8π) / 2)\n\nNow, calculate the magnitude and phase:\n\nMagnitude: |G(j(8π))| ≈ 0.0316\nPhase: ∠G(j(8π)) ≈ 1.325 rad (≈ 75.96°)\n\nSo, the frequency response of the system at 4 Hz is approximately 0.0316 with a phase of 75.96°."
