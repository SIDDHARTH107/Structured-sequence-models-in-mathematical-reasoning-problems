If it is path-connected, provide a path connecting the point $(1,0)$ to the point $(2,0)$ in $A$. If it is not path-connected, provide a proof.",
    "message_2": "The set $A$ is not path-connected.\n\nProof: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a path $\\gamma:[0,1]\\rightarrow A$ such that $\\gamma(0)=(1,0)$ and $\\gamma(1)=(2,0)$. Let $B=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2 | x^2+y^2<1\\}$ and $C=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2 | x^2+y^2=1\\}$. Note that $B$ is an open set and $C$ is a closed set.\n\nNow, consider the function $f:[0,1]\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(t)=\\gamma(t)_1$, where $\\gamma(t)_1$ denotes the first coordinate of $\\gamma(t)$. Since $\\gamma$ is continuous, $f$ is also continuous. We have $f(0)=1$ and $f(1)=2$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists $t_0\\in(0,1)$ such that $f(t_0)=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nLet $(x_0,y_0)=\\gamma(t_0)$. Then $x_0=\\frac{3}{2}$ and $(x_0,y_0)\\in A$. Since $(x_0,y_0)\\notin\\{(2,0)\\}$, we must have $(x_0,y_0)\\in\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2 | x^2+y^2\\leqslant 1\\}$. But this is a contradiction because $(\\frac{3}{2})^2+y_0^2>1$. Therefore, no such path $\\gamma$ exists, and the set $A$ is not path-connected."
