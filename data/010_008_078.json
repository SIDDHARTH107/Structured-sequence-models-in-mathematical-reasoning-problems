    "message_2": "To find the total number of faces of an n-simplex, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal faces = (n+1) choose 0 + (n+1) choose 1 + ... + (n+1) choose n\n\nThis formula is derived from the fact that each face of an n-simplex is a k-simplex for some k between 0 and n, and there are (n+1) choose (k+1) ways to choose the vertices of a k-simplex from the (n+1) vertices of the n-simplex.\n\nFor example, in the case of an 8-simplex:\n\nTotal faces = 9C0 + 9C1 + 9C2 + 9C3 + 9C4 + 9C5 + 9C6 + 9C7 + 9C8\n                   = 1 + 9 + 36 + 84 + 126 + 126 + 84 + 36 + 1\n                   = 504\n\nSo, an 8-simplex has 504 faces in total.\n\nFor an n-simplex, the total number of faces will be:\n\nTotal faces = (n+1)C0 + (n+1)C1 + ... + (n+1)Cn"
