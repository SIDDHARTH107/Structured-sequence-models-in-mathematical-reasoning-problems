    "message_1": "A company wants to know the average age of its employees. The company has a total of 200 employees but surveying all of them is not feasible due to time and cost constraints. Therefore, they plan to select a sample of employees using the systematic sampling technique. If they decide to select every 10th employee, what is the size of the sample that they need to survey to estimate the average age of all employees within a margin of error of 2 years at a 95% confidence level?",
    "message_2": "To determine the sample size needed to estimate the average age of all employees within a margin of error of 2 years at a 95% confidence level, we can use the following formula for sample size estimation:\n\nn = (Z^2 * σ^2) / E^2\n\nwhere:\nn = sample size\nZ = Z-score (1.96 for a 95% confidence level)\nσ = population standard deviation (unknown)\nE = margin of error (2 years)\n\nSince we don't have the population standard deviation (σ), we can use an estimated standard deviation based on similar studies or make an educated guess. For this problem, let's assume a standard deviation of 10 years.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 10^2) / 2^2\nn = (3.8416 * 100) / 4\nn = 384.16 / 4\nn = 96.04\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 97.\n\nHowever, the company plans to use systematic sampling by selecting every 10th employee. To account for this, we'll divide the total number of employees (200) by the sample size (97):\n\n200 / 97 ≈ 2.06\n\nSince the company plans to select every 10th employee, they will need to survey approximately 20 employees (10 * 2.06 ≈ 20) to estimate the average age of all employees within a margin of error of 2 years at a 95% confidence level."
