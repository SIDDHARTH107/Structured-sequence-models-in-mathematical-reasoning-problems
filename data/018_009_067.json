    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3), (6,1), (6,3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × C. This is the set of all ordered pairs ((a, b), c) where (a, b) is in A × B and c is in C.\n\n(A × B) × C = {((2,1),5), ((2,3),5), ((4,1),5), ((4,3),5), ((6,1),5), ((6,3),5)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and C, denoted as B × C. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, c) where b is in B and c is in C.\n\nB × C = {(1,5), (3,5)}\n\nNow, let's find A × (B × C). This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, (b, c)) where a is in A and (b, c) is in B × C.\n\nA × (B × C) = {(2,(1,5)), (2,(3,5)), (4,(1,5)), (4,(3,5)), (6,(1,5)), (6,(3,5))}\n\nNow, let's rewrite the elements of (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) as ordered triples (a, b, c) to compare them more easily.\n\n(A × B) × C = {(2,1,5), (2,3,5), (4,1,5), (4,3,5), (6,1,5), (6,3,5)}\nA × (B × C) = {(2,1,5), (2,3,5), (4,1,5), (4,3,5), (6,1,5), (6,3,5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) have the same elements, so they are equal. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of sets is associative."
