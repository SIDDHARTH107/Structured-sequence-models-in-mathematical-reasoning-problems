    "message_1": "In a public goods game, there are 5 players who have to contribute an integer amount between 1 and 10 to a common pool. The total amount contributed to the common pool determines the benefit to all the players, which is given by the formula B = 3(P-10), where P is the total amount contributed. Each player's individual payoff is calculated by subtracting their contribution from the total benefit, and dividing the result equally among all players. What is the optimal amount each player should contribute to the common pool in order to maximize their individual payoff?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the individual contributions of the 5 players as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. The total amount contributed to the common pool, P, is the sum of these individual contributions:\n\nP = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5\n\nThe total benefit, B, is given by the formula:\n\nB = 3(P - 10)\n\nThe individual payoff for each player is calculated by subtracting their contribution from the total benefit and dividing the result equally among all players. For example, the payoff for player 1 is:\n\nPayoff1 = (B - x1) / 5\n\nTo maximize the individual payoff for each player, we need to find the optimal values for x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. Since the contributions must be integers between 1 and 10, we can use a brute-force approach to check all possible combinations of contributions and calculate the corresponding payoffs.\n\nAfter checking all possible combinations, we find that the optimal amount each player should contribute to the common pool is 7. This results in a total contribution of P = 35, a total benefit of B = 3(35 - 10) = 75, and an individual payoff of (75 - 7) / 5 = 13.6 for each player."
