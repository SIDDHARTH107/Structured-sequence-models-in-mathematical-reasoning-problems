What is the minimum number of connections that need to be made between the six people to guarantee that there is a group of three people who are all friends with each other or a group of three people who are all strangers to each other?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one person from the group of six. This person can have at most five connections with the other five people. Out of these five connections, at least three of them must be either friends or strangers (since there are only two possibilities for each connection).\n\nNow, let's assume that there are no groups of three people who are all friends or all strangers. This means that for each person, they have exactly two friends and three strangers among the other five people.\n\nLet's label the six people as A, B, C, D, E, and F. Suppose A has two friends, B and C, and three strangers, D, E, and F. Now, let's consider the connections between B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nIf B and C are friends, then we have a group of three friends (A, B, and C), which contradicts our assumption. So, B and C must be strangers. Now, let's look at the connections between D, E, and F.\n\n1. If D and E are friends, then we have a group of three friends (D, E, and A), which contradicts our assumption.\n2. If D and E are strangers, then we have a group of three strangers (D, E, and B), which also contradicts our assumption.\n\nIn both cases, we have a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption that there are no groups of three people who are all friends or all strangers is incorrect. Therefore, the minimum number of connections needed to guarantee a group of three people who are all friends or all strangers is 0, as it is already guaranteed in a group of six people."
