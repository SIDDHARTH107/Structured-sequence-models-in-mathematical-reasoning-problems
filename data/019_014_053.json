Prove that there exist infinitely many elements in Q. \n2. Prove that there exist infinitely many elements in P that are not in Q.",
    "message_2": "1. To prove that there exist infinitely many elements in Q, consider the following:\n\nLet p1, p2, p3, ... be an infinite sequence of distinct prime numbers. For each i, let qi = p1 * p2 * pi. Note that qi is divisible by exactly three prime numbers: p1, p2, and pi. Since there are infinitely many prime numbers, there are infinitely many distinct values of qi, and thus infinitely many elements in Q.\n\n2. To prove that there exist infinitely many elements in P that are not in Q, we can use a proof by contradiction:\n\nAssume that there are only finitely many elements in P that are not in Q. Let p1, p2, ..., pn be all the prime numbers that are not in Q. Now consider the number N = (p1 * p2 * ... * pn) + 1. By construction, N is not divisible by any of the primes p1, p2, ..., pn.\n\nNow, N is either prime or composite. If N is prime, then N is a prime number not in our list, which contradicts our assumption that we have listed all the prime numbers not in Q.\n\nIf N is composite, then it must have a prime factor, say p. Since N is not divisible by any of the primes p1, p2, ..., pn, it follows that p is not in our list of primes. Furthermore, since N is not divisible by three prime numbers, p is not in Q. This again contradicts our assumption that we have listed all the prime numbers not in Q.\n\nIn either case, we have a contradiction, which implies that there must be infinitely many elements in P that are not in Q."
