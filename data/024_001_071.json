    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t) at t = 3π/2, we need to compute the first and second derivatives of r(t) with respect to t, and then use the formulas for curvature (k) and torsion (τ).\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of r(t):\n\nr(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t)\nr'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1)\nr''(t) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)\n\nNow, let's evaluate r'(t) and r''(t) at t = 3π/2:\n\nr'(3π/2) = (-sin(3π/2), cos(3π/2), 1) = (0, -1, 1)\nr''(3π/2) = (-cos(3π/2), -sin(3π/2), 0) = (1, 0, 0)\n\nNext, we'll find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nwhere x denotes the cross product.\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (0, -1, 1) x (1, 0, 0) = (0, 0, -1)\n\nNow, we'll find the magnitudes of r'(t) and r'(t) x r''(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(0^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = sqrt(0^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = 1\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nk = 1 / (sqrt(2))^3 = 1 / (2 * sqrt(2)) = 1 / (2 * sqrt(2))\n\nFinally, we'll find the torsion (τ) using the formula:\n\nτ = (r'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t))) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nwhere • denotes the dot product.\n\nr'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t)) = (0, -1, 1) • (0, 0, -1) = -1\n\nNow, we can find the torsion:\n\nτ = -1 / 1^2 = -1\n\nSo, the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) of the curve r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t) at t = 3π/2 are:\n\nk = 1 / (2 * sqrt(2))\nτ = -1"
