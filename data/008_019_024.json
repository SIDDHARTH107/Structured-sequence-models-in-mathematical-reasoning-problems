    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method in this case.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 2x + 4y - 2z = 10\n(2) 2x - y + 3z = 2i\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(3) 5y - 5z = 10 - 2i\n\nNow, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(4) 3x + 6y - 3z = 15\n(5) 3x + y + 2z = 1 + i\n\nNow, subtract equation (5) from equation (4):\n\n(6) 5y - 5z = 14 - i\n\nNow, we have two equations with the same coefficients for y and z:\n\n(3) 5y - 5z = 10 - 2i\n(6) 5y - 5z = 14 - i\n\nSubtract equation (3) from equation (6):\n\n(7) 0 = 4 - i\n\nThis equation implies that i = 4, which is a contradiction since i is the imaginary unit and cannot be equal to a real number. Therefore, this system of linear equations has no solution."
