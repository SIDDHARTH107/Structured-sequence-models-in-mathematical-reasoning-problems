    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the intersection cohomology group IH^2(Y), we first need to determine the Hodge numbers of Y. Since Y is the intersection of two hypersurfaces of degrees 4 and 5 in projective 4-space, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to relate the Hodge numbers of Y to those of X.\n\nThe Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth projective variety Y of dimension n, which is the intersection of a smooth projective variety X of dimension n+1 with a hyperplane, the Hodge numbers h^{p,q}(Y) are equal to h^{p,q}(X) for p+q < n and h^{p,q}(Y) = h^{p-1,q-1}(X) for p+q = n.\n\nIn our case, Y is the intersection of two hypersurfaces of degrees 4 and 5 in projective 4-space, so it has dimension 2. Thus, we have:\n\nh^{0,0}(Y) = h^{0,0}(X) = 1\nh^{1,0}(Y) = h^{1,0}(X) = g\nh^{0,1}(Y) = h^{0,1}(X) = g\nh^{1,1}(Y) = h^{0,2}(X) + h^{2,0}(X)\n\nSince X is a non-singular projective curve of genus 3, its Hodge numbers are:\n\nh^{0,0}(X) = 1\nh^{1,0}(X) = h^{0,1}(X) = 3\nh^{2,0}(X) = h^{0,2}(X) = 0\n\nNow we can compute the Hodge numbers of Y:\n\nh^{0,0}(Y) = 1\nh^{1,0}(Y) = h^{0,1}(Y) = 3\nh^{1,1}(Y) = h^{0,2}(X) + h^{2,0}(X) = 0\n\nThe intersection cohomology group IH^2(Y) is related to the Hodge numbers of Y by the following formula:\n\ndim(IH^2(Y)) = h^{0,2}(Y) + h^{1,1}(Y) + h^{2,0}(Y)\n\nUsing the computed Hodge numbers of Y, we get:\n\ndim(IH^2(Y)) = h^{0,2}(Y) + h^{1,1}(Y) + h^{2,0}(Y) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group IH^2(Y) is 0."
