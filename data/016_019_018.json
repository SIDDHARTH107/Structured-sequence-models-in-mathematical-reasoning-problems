    "message_2": "A Koch island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve construction to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of line segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each line segment is reduced by a factor of 3.\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter after 4 iterations:\n\nInitial side length: 12 cm\nInitial perimeter: 3 * 12 = 36 cm\n\nIteration 1:\nNumber of line segments: 3 * 4 = 12\nLength of each line segment: 12 / 3 = 4 cm\nPerimeter: 12 * 4 = 48 cm\n\nIteration 2:\nNumber of line segments: 12 * 4 = 48\nLength of each line segment: 4 / 3 = 4/3 cm\nPerimeter: 48 * (4/3) = 64 cm\n\nIteration 3:\nNumber of line segments: 48 * 4 = 192\nLength of each line segment: (4/3) / 3 = 4/9 cm\nPerimeter: 192 * (4/9) = 256/3 cm\n\nIteration 4:\nNumber of line segments: 192 * 4 = 768\nLength of each line segment: (4/9) / 3 = 4/27 cm\nPerimeter: 768 * (4/27) = 1024/9 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after 4 iterations is 1024/9 cm, or approximately 113.78 cm."
