Apply the Fourier transform to determine the temperature distribution in the rod when t = 5 seconds, assuming the initial temperature is uniform at 20°C and the rod is well insulated at the ends. The thermal diffusivity of the rod is 1 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Fourier series solution to the heat equation. The heat equation for a one-dimensional rod with insulated ends is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature distribution in the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity, and t is time.\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is given by f(x) = x(10 - x). We will first find the Fourier series representation of f(x) over the interval [0, 10]. The Fourier series representation of a function f(x) over the interval [0, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a₀/2 + Σ [aₙcos(nπx/L) + bₙsin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere a₀ = (2/L) ∫[0 to L] f(x) dx, aₙ = (2/L) ∫[0 to L] f(x)cos(nπx/L) dx, and bₙ = (2/L) ∫[0 to L] f(x)sin(nπx/L) dx.\n\nFor f(x) = x(10 - x), we have:\n\na₀ = (2/10) ∫[0 to 10] x(10 - x) dx = 0 (due to symmetry)\n\naₙ = 0 (due to symmetry)\n\nbₙ = (2/10) ∫[0 to 10] x(10 - x)sin(nπx/10) dx\n\nTo find bₙ, we can integrate by parts twice:\n\nu = x(10 - x), dv = sin(nπx/10) dx\ndu = (10 - 2x) dx, v = -(10/nπ)cos(nπx/10)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nbₙ = (2/10) [(uv)|₀¹⁰ - ∫[0 to 10] v du]\n\nbₙ = (2/10) [(-x(10 - x)(10/nπ)cos(nπx/10))|₀¹⁰ - ∫[0 to 10] (10 - 2x)(-10/nπ)cos(nπx/10) dx]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)ⁿ, the first term evaluates to 0. Now, we can integrate by parts again:\n\nu = (10 - 2x), dv = (-10/nπ)cos(nπx/10) dx\ndu = -2 dx, v = (-100/n²π²)sin(nπx/10)\n\nbₙ = (2/10) [(-100/n²π²)(10 - 2x)sin(nπx/10)|₀¹⁰ - ∫[0 to 10] (-100/n²π²)(-2)sin(nπx/10) dx]\n\nThe first term evaluates to 0 again, and we have:\n\nbₙ = (20/n²π²) ∫[0 to 10] sin(nπx/10) dx\n\nbₙ = (20/n²π²) [(10/nπ)(-cos(nπx/10))|₀¹⁰]\n\nbₙ = (200/n³π³) [1 - (-1)ⁿ]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [(200/n³π³) [1 - (-1)ⁿ] sin(nπx/10)]\n\nThe solution to the heat equation is given by:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(200/n³π³) [1 - (-1)ⁿ] sin(nπx/10) e^(-n²π²αt/100)]\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 5 seconds:\n\nu(x, 5) = Σ [(200/n³π³) [1 - (-1)ⁿ] sin(nπx/10) e^(-n²π²(5)/100)]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution in the rod at t = 5 seconds."
