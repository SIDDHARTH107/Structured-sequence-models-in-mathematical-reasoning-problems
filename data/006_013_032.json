    "message_1": "A region has a historical average of 2 earthquakes per year with a standard deviation of 0.5. What is the probability that this region will experience at least 3 earthquakes next year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of experiencing at least 3 earthquakes next year, we can use the normal distribution. First, we need to find the z-score for 3 earthquakes.\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\nwhere X is the number of earthquakes, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nz = (3 - 2) / 0.5\nz = 1 / 0.5\nz = 2\n\nNow, we can use a z-table or calculator to find the probability of having a z-score less than 2. The probability of having a z-score less than 2 is approximately 0.9772. Since we want the probability of at least 3 earthquakes, we need to find the probability of having a z-score greater than 2.\n\nP(Z > 2) = 1 - P(Z < 2)\nP(Z > 2) = 1 - 0.9772\nP(Z > 2) = 0.0228\n\nSo, the probability of experiencing at least 3 earthquakes next year is approximately 2.28%."
