    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In a complete graph K7, there are 7 vertices, and each vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian cycle in K7 is as follows:\n\n1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 1\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex (1). Since K7 is a complete graph, there are multiple Hamiltonian cycles possible, but this is one valid example."
