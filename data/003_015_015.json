    "message_1": "The height (in meters) of a Ferris wheel above the ground as a function of time (in seconds) can be modeled by the equation h(t) = 45 + 35sin(0.2t), where t represents time. What is the amplitude and period of the Ferris wheel's motion?",
    "message_2": "The given equation is h(t) = 45 + 35sin(0.2t). This is a sinusoidal function of the form h(t) = A + Bsin(Ct), where A is the vertical shift, B is the amplitude, and C is the angular frequency.\n\nIn this case, A = 45, B = 35, and C = 0.2.\n\nThe amplitude of the Ferris wheel's motion is the value of B, which is 35 meters.\n\nTo find the period of the Ferris wheel's motion, we can use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / C\n\nIn this case, C = 0.2, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = 2π / 0.2 = 10π seconds\n\nSo, the amplitude of the Ferris wheel's motion is 35 meters, and the period is 10π seconds."
