    "message_2": "To determine whether (A x B)' is equal to A' x B', let's first find the Cartesian product A x B, and then find its complement. After that, we'll find the complements of sets A and B individually, and then find their Cartesian product.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's consider the universal set U. Since we don't have any information about U, we'll assume that U contains all the elements from sets A and B. So, U = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A x B with respect to U x U.\n\nU x U = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\n(A x B)' = U x U - A x B = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the complements of sets A and B individually with respect to U.\n\nA' = U - A = {3, 4}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product A' x B':\n\nA' x B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B)' â‰  A' x B', since the two sets have different elements:\n\n(A x B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\nA' x B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}"
