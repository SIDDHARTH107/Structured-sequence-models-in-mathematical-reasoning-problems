    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the complex torus, we first need to understand the structure of the quotient space. The complex torus is formed by taking the quotient of the complex plane by a lattice. In this case, the lattice is generated by $2\\pi\\mathbb{Z} + i2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\Lambda$.\n\nLet's first consider the lattice generated by $2\\pi\\mathbb{Z} + i2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$. This is a lattice formed by all integer multiples of $2\\pi$ and $i2\\pi$. This lattice is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ since it is generated by two linearly independent vectors in the complex plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the lattice $\\Lambda$ generated by $1$ and $i$. This is also a lattice formed by all integer multiples of $1$ and $i$. This lattice is also isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ since it is generated by two linearly independent vectors in the complex plane.\n\nNow, we need to compute the quotient of the complex torus $(\\mathbb{C}/(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}) + i2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})/\\Lambda$. This is equivalent to finding the quotient of the lattices $(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z} + i2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})/\\Lambda$. Since both lattices are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, we can think of this as finding the quotient of two $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ lattices.\n\nThe quotient of two lattices is the set of cosets formed by taking the difference of the elements in the two lattices. In this case, we have:\n\n$(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z} + i2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})/\\Lambda = \\{ (2\\pi m + i2\\pi n) - (a + bi) \\mid m, n, a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z} + i2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})/\\Lambda = \\{ (2\\pi m - a) + i(2\\pi n - b) \\mid m, n, a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of the real and imaginary parts of the elements in this quotient space. The real part can take values in the set $\\{ 2\\pi m - a \\mid m, a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$, and the imaginary part can take values in the set $\\{ 2\\pi n - b \\mid n, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n\nSince $m$ and $a$ are integers, the real part can take any integer multiple of $2\\pi$. Similarly, the imaginary part can take any integer multiple of $2\\pi$. Therefore, the elements in the quotient space can be written as integer multiples of $2\\pi$ and $i2\\pi$.\n\nThis means that the quotient space is isomorphic to the lattice generated by $2\\pi$ and $i2\\pi$. This lattice is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is a 2-dimensional lattice.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the complex torus $(\\mathbb{C}/(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}) + i2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})/\\Lambda$ is 2."
