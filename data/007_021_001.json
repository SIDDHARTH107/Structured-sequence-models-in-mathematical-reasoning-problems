    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding a non-trivial factor of a composite number. To find the smallest prime factor of 4294967297 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N, where N is the number we want to factor.\n2. Choose random initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for x and y, updating their values as follows:\n   x = f(x)\n   y = f(f(y))\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and N.\n5. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is equal to N, the algorithm has failed. If the GCD is between 1 and N, we have found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the smallest prime factor of 4294967297:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 4294967297\n2. x = y = 2\n\nNow we'll iterate and calculate the GCD:\n\n3. x = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 4294967297 = 5\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 4294967297 = 26\n   GCD(|5 - 26|, 4294967297) = GCD(21, 4294967297) = 1\n\nSince the GCD is 1, we'll continue iterating:\n\n4. x = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 4294967297 = 26\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 4294967297 = 458330\n   GCD(|26 - 458330|, 4294967297) = GCD(458304, 4294967297) = 1\n\nAgain, the GCD is 1, so we'll continue iterating:\n\n5. x = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) mod 4294967297 = 677\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(458330)) = f(171243290) = (171243290^2 + 1) mod 4294967297 = 4257693294\n   GCD(|677 - 4257693294|, 4294967297) = GCD(4257692617, 4294967297) = 641\n\nThis time, the GCD is not 1, and it's not equal to N. Therefore, we have found a non-trivial factor of 4294967297, which is 641. Since 641 is a prime number, it is the smallest prime factor of 4294967297."
