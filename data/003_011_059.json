    "message_1": "A 25-meter flagpole stands on level ground. If you stand 20 meters away from the base of the flagpole, what is the height of the flagpole, assuming the ground is level? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "The height of the flagpole is given as 25 meters. Since the ground is level, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between you and the top of the flagpole. Let's denote the distance between you and the top of the flagpole as \"d\".\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, a² + b² = c², where a and b are the legs of the right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse. In this case, a = 20 meters (distance from you to the base of the flagpole), b = 25 meters (height of the flagpole), and c = d (distance between you and the top of the flagpole).\n\n20² + 25² = d²\n400 + 625 = d²\n1025 = d²\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the value of d:\n\n√1025 = d\nd ≈ 32.0156\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the height of the flagpole, which is already given as 25 meters. Therefore, the height of the flagpole is 25 meters."
