    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 10 cm. What is the length of its longest diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the longest diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 6 cm, and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(8² + 6² + 10²)\nDiagonal length = √(64 + 36 + 100)\nDiagonal length = √200\n\nThe length of the longest diagonal is √200 cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
