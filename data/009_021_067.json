    "message_2": "To solve the given 2D heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = k(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by kXYT, we obtain:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = (X''(x) / X(x)) + (Y''(y) / Y(y))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -μ\nY''(y) / Y(y) = -(λ + μ)\n\nNow, we solve the three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) separately:\n\n1. T'(t) = -kλT(t)\nThe solution to this ODE is:\nT(t) = Ce^(-kλt), where C is a constant.\n\n2. X''(x) = -μX(x)\nThe solution to this ODE is:\nX(x) = A*cos(√μx) + B*sin(√μx), where A and B are constants.\n\n3. Y''(y) = -(λ + μ)Y(y)\nThe solution to this ODE is:\nY(y) = D*cos(√(λ + μ)y) + E*sin(√(λ + μ)y), where D and E are constants.\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, y, t) = u(1, y, t) = u(x, 0, t) = u(x, 1, t) = 0\n\nX(0)Y(y)T(t) = X(1)Y(y)T(t) = X(x)Y(0)T(t) = X(x)Y(1)T(t) = 0\n\nFrom the boundary conditions, we have:\n\nA = 0 (since X(0) = 0)\nB*sin(√μ) = 0 (since X(1) = 0)\nD = 0 (since Y(0) = 0)\nE*sin(√(λ + μ)) = 0 (since Y(1) = 0)\n\nSince B and E cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we have:\n\nsin(√μ) = 0 => √μ = nπ => μ = n²π², where n is an integer.\n\nsin(√(λ + μ)) = 0 => √(λ + μ) = mπ => λ + μ = m²π², where m is an integer.\n\nNow, we can write the solution as:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑(B_nmsin(nπx)sin(mπy)e^(-k(n²+m²)π²t))\n\nApplying the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx)sin(πy), we get:\n\nB_nm = 1 for n = m = 1, and B_nm = 0 for all other values of n and m.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-kπ²t)\n\nNow, we can find the solution for t = 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 units with k = 0.2:\n\nu(x, y, 0.1) = sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-0.2π²*0.1)\nu(x, y, 0.5) = sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-0.2π²*0.5)\nu(x, y, 1.0) = sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-0.2π²*1.0)\n\nThese are the solutions for the given 2D heat equation at the specified times with the given initial and boundary conditions."
