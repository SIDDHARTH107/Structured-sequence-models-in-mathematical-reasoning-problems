    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0.\n\nSince f(x) is an even function (f(-x) = f(x)), the Fourier series will only have cosine terms. Therefore, b_n = 0 for all n. We can compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and a_0 using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3)x^3](-π to π)\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3)(π^3) - (1/3)(-π^3)]\na_0 = (1/π) * (2/3)(π^3)\na_0 = (2/3)π^2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\n\nIntegration by parts:\nu = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/n) * sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(x^2 * (1/n) * sin(nx))(-π to π) - ∫[-π, π] (1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x dx]\n\nThe first term (x^2 * (1/n) * sin(nx)) vanishes at both x = -π and x = π, so the first term becomes 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the integral in the second term:\n\n∫[-π, π] (1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x dx\n\nIntegration by parts again:\nu = 2x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = (-1/n^2) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\n∫[-π, π] (1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x dx = [(-1/n^2) * 2x * cos(nx)](-π to π) - ∫[-π, π] (-1/n^2) * cos(nx) * 2 dx\n\nThe first term (2x * (-1/n^2) * cos(nx)) vanishes at both x = -π and x = π, so the first term becomes 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the integral in the second term:\n\n∫[-π, π] (-1/n^2) * cos(nx) * 2 dx = (-2/n^2) * ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx\n\nThe integral of cos(nx) over the interval [-π, π] is 0 for n ≠ 0. Therefore, the entire expression becomes 0.\n\nSo, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow we have the Fourier series:\n\nf(x) = (1/2) * a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\nf(x) = (1/2) * (2/3)π^2\n\nSince the Fourier series converges to a constant value, (1/2) * (2/3)π^2, it does not converge to the original function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π]. However, it converges to the average value of the function over the interval."
