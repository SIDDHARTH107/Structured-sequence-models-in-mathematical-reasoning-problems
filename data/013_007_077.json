    "message_1": "Here's a problem for a math student to solve related to Tragedy of the Commons:\n\nIn a village, a common grazing land is available to all the shepherds to graze their sheep. Suppose there are 10 shepherds with a total of 200 sheep who graze their sheep in the common grazing land. Each shepherd wants to maximize their profit by letting more sheep graze, but they are mindful of the Tragedy of the Commons. If the carrying capacity of the grazing land is 300 sheep, what is the optimal number of sheep each shepherd should allow to graze to maximize their profit?\n\nAssume that each shepherd earns a profit of $10 per sheep, but for every additional sheep above the carrying capacity, there is a penalty cost of $5.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of sheep each shepherd allows to graze. Since there are 10 shepherds, the total number of sheep grazing will be 10x. The carrying capacity of the grazing land is 300 sheep. \n\nThe profit per sheep is $10, so the total profit for all shepherds is 10x * $10 = $100x.\n\nIf the total number of sheep grazing exceeds the carrying capacity (300), there will be a penalty cost of $5 per additional sheep. The number of additional sheep above the carrying capacity is (10x - 300). So, the total penalty cost is ($5)(10x - 300).\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the optimal value of x that maximizes the total profit minus the penalty cost:\n\nMaximize: P(x) = $100x - $5(10x - 300)\n\nFirst, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of P(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = 100 - 50 = 0\n\nThere are no critical points since the derivative is a constant (50) and does not depend on x. However, we know that the carrying capacity is 300 sheep, and if the shepherds graze more than 300 sheep, they will incur a penalty cost. Therefore, to maximize their profit, they should graze exactly 300 sheep in total.\n\nSince there are 10 shepherds, the optimal number of sheep each shepherd should allow to graze is:\n\n300 sheep / 10 shepherds = 30 sheep per shepherd"
