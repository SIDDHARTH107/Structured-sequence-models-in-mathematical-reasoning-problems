    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 96: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. List all the possible divisors of 96: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96\n3. Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the number of groups of each prime power order in the factorization.\n\nFor the prime power 2^5, there are five possible groups: C_2, C_4, C_8, C_{16}, and C_{32}.\n\nFor the prime power 3^1, there is only one possible group: C_3.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of groups of order 96:\n\nNumber of groups = (number of groups of order 2^5) * (number of groups of order 3^1) = 5 * 1 = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
