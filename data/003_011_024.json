    "message_1": "A student stands at point A and spots a building at point B. The angle of elevation from the student to the top of the building is 30 degrees. The distance from the student to the building is 50 meters. Using trigonometry, what is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the distance from the student to the building (adjacent side) is 50 meters, and we want to find the height of the building (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 50\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\nheight = 50 * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, multiply this value by 50 to find the height:\n\nheight ≈ 50 * 0.577 ≈ 28.85 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 28.85 meters."
