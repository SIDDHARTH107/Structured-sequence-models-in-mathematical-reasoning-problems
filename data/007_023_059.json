    "message_1": "Let's say you have a message consisting of 35 alphanumeric characters. Using SHA-256 Cryptographic hash function, what is the total number of possible outputs or hash values that can be generated for this message?",
    "message_2": "The SHA-256 cryptographic hash function generates a fixed-size output of 256 bits (32 bytes) for any input. Since each bit can have 2 possible values (0 or 1), the total number of possible outputs or hash values that can be generated for any message, including a 35-character alphanumeric message, is:\n\n2^256 = 1.1579209 x 10^77\n\nSo, there are approximately 1.1579209 x 10^77 unique hash values that can be generated using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function."
