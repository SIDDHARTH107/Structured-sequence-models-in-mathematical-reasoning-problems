If Player 2 has a utility function of U(x) = sqrt(x), what is their level of satisfaction with the amount they received from Player 1?",
    "message_2": "Player 1 decided to keep $80 and give Player 2 the remaining amount. Since the total amount is $100, Player 2 receives $100 - $80 = $20.\n\nPlayer 2's utility function is U(x) = sqrt(x). To find their level of satisfaction with the $20 they received, we plug in the value of x into the utility function:\n\nU(20) = sqrt(20)\n\nU(20) â‰ˆ 4.47\n\nPlayer 2's level of satisfaction with the amount they received from Player 1 is approximately 4.47."
