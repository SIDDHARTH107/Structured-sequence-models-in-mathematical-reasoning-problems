    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we first need to find its eigenvalues. We do this by solving the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is an eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [5-λ 0 0; 0 2-λ 0; 0 0 8-λ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n|(5-λ)(2-λ)(8-λ)|\n\nSetting the determinant equal to zero and solving for λ, we get the eigenvalues:\n\n(5-λ)(2-λ)(8-λ) = 0\n\nλ1 = 5\nλ2 = 2\nλ3 = 8\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. We do this by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 5:\n\n(A - 5I)v = [0 0 0; 0 -3 0; 0 0 3]v = 0\n\nThe eigenvector v1 can be any scalar multiple of [1; 0; 0].\n\nFor λ2 = 2:\n\n(A - 2I)v = [3 0 0; 0 0 0; 0 0 6]v = 0\n\nThe eigenvector v2 can be any scalar multiple of [0; 1; 0].\n\nFor λ3 = 8:\n\n(A - 8I)v = [-3 0 0; 0 -6 0; 0 0 0]v = 0\n\nThe eigenvector v3 can be any scalar multiple of [0; 0; 1].\n\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can diagonalize the matrix A. The diagonal matrix D consists of the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nD = [5 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 8]\n\nAnd the matrix P consists of the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1]\n\nSince A is already a diagonal matrix, we have:\n\nA = PDP^(-1)\n\nIn this case, P^(-1) = P, so:\n\nA = PDP = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1] [5 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 8] [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1] = [5 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 8]\n\nThus, the matrix A is diagonalized."
