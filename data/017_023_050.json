    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we will consider each of the given types of groups separately.\n\n1. Cyclic group C72:\nThere is only one cyclic group of order 72, which is isomorphic to the group of integers modulo 72 under addition. So, there is only 1 cyclic group of order 72.\n\n2. Alternating group A4 × C3 × C2:\nThe alternating group A4 has order 12, and C3 and C2 have orders 3 and 2, respectively. The direct product of these groups has order 12 × 3 × 2 = 72. Since A4, C3, and C2 are all distinct groups, their direct product is also a distinct group. So, there is only 1 group of this type.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 72:\nTo find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we can use the fact that there are 50 groups of order 72 in total (according to the OEIS sequence A000688). We have already found 1 cyclic group and 1 alternating group, both of which are not non-abelian. Therefore, there are 50 - 1 - 1 = 48 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 1 + 1 + 48 = 50 non-isomorphic groups of order 72 among the given types of groups."
