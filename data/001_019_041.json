    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x - 1| = 3, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 1 = 3\nIn this case, we simply solve for x:\n2x = 3 + 1\n2x = 4\nx = 4/2\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 2x - 1 = -3\nIn this case, we also solve for x:\n2x = -3 + 1\n2x = -2\nx = -2/2\nx = -1\n\nSo the solutions for the equation |2x - 1| = 3 are x = 2 and x = -1."
