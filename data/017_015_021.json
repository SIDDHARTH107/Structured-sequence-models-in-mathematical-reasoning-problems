    "message_2": "There are 15 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 24. They are as follows:\n\n1. Z_24: The cyclic group of order 24.\n2. Z_12 × Z_2: The direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 12 and 2.\n3. Z_8 × Z_3: The direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 8 and 3.\n4. Z_6 × Z_4: The direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 6 and 4.\n5. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2: The direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 4, 2, and 2.\n6. Z_3 × S_3: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 and the symmetric group of degree 3.\n7. Z_3 × D_8: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 and the dihedral group of order 8.\n8. Z_3 × Q_8: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 and the quaternion group of order 8.\n9. S_4: The symmetric group of degree 4.\n10. A_4 × Z_2: The direct product of the alternating group of degree 4 and the cyclic group of order 2.\n11. D_12: The dihedral group of order 12.\n12. Q_8 × Z_3: The direct product of the quaternion group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 3.\n13. SL(2,3): The special linear group of degree 2 over the field with 3 elements.\n14. Z_4 ⋊ Z_6: The semidirect product of the cyclic groups of orders 4 and 6.\n15. Z_2 × S_3 × Z_2: The direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3 and the cyclic groups of orders 2 and 2.\n\nThese groups can be found using the Sylow theorems and considering the possible structures of groups of order 24."
