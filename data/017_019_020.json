Semi-direct product of C9 and C4\n\nTo find their corresponding group multiplication tables, we need to list the elements and define the group operation for each group.\n\n1. Cyclic group C36:\nThe elements are {1, a, a^2, ..., a^35}, where a has order 36.\nThe group operation is the multiplication modulo 36.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups C6 x C6:\nThe elements are {(a^i, b^j) | 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 5}, where a and b have order 6.\nThe group operation is component-wise multiplication modulo 6.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups C9 x C4:\nThe elements are {(a^i, b^j) | 0 ≤ i ≤ 8, 0 ≤ j ≤ 3}, where a has order 9 and b has order 4.\nThe group operation is component-wise multiplication modulo 9 for the first component and modulo 4 for the second component.\n\n4. Semi-direct product of C9 and C4:\nLet C9 = {1, a, a^2, ..., a^8} and C4 = {1, b, b^2, b^3}, where a has order 9 and b has order 4.\nThe elements are {(a^i, b^j) | 0 ≤ i ≤ 8, 0 ≤ j ≤ 3}.\nThe group operation is defined as (a^i, b^j)(a^k, b^l) = (a^i * a^(k * (b^j)), b^j * b^l), where the action of b^j on a^k is defined by a^(k * (b^j)).\n\nTo write down the group multiplication tables, you would need to compute the product of every pair of elements in each group according to the group operation defined above. This would result in four tables of size 36x36, which is too large to include here. However, you can use the definitions provided to compute the tables yourself."
