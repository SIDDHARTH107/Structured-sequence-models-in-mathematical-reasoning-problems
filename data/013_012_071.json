    "message_1": "Suppose there are two companies A and B competing in the market with A being the leader (Stackelberg model). Company A produces at a cost of cA and its Demand function is given by: QA = 300 - 2PA - PB. Company B produces at a cost of cB and its Demand function is given by: QB = 200 - PA - 2PB. Find the optimal production levels and profits for both companies.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production levels and profits for both companies, we need to first find the reaction functions for both companies. The reaction function shows the best response of a firm to the output of its rival.\n\nStep 1: Find the profit functions for both companies.\nProfit function for company A: πA = PA * QA - cA * QA\nProfit function for company B: πB = PB * QB - cB * QB\n\nStep 2: Substitute the demand functions into the profit functions.\nπA = (300 - 2PA - PB) * PA - cA * (300 - 2PA - PB)\nπB = (200 - PA - 2PB) * PB - cB * (200 - PA - 2PB)\n\nStep 3: Find the first-order conditions (FOC) for both companies by taking the partial derivative of the profit functions with respect to their respective prices.\n∂πA/∂PA = 300 - 4PA - 2PB - cA = 0\n∂πB/∂PB = 200 - 2PA - 4PB - cB = 0\n\nStep 4: Solve the FOC equations for the reaction functions.\nFrom the FOC of company A, we get: PA = (300 - 2PB - cA)/4\nFrom the FOC of company B, we get: PB = (200 - 2PA - cB)/4\n\nStep 5: Since company A is the leader, company B will take company A's reaction function as given and substitute it into its own reaction function.\nPB = (200 - 2((300 - 2PB - cA)/4) - cB)/4\n\nStep 6: Solve for PB.\nPB = (800 - 300 - cA + 2cB)/12\n\nStep 7: Substitute the value of PB back into the reaction function of company A to find PA.\nPA = (300 - 2((800 - 300 - cA + 2cB)/12) - cA)/4\n\nStep 8: Solve for PA.\nPA = (1200 - 800 + cA - 2cB)/12\n\nStep 9: Substitute the values of PA and PB back into the demand functions to find the optimal production levels QA and QB.\nQA = 300 - 2((1200 - 800 + cA - 2cB)/12) - ((800 - 300 - cA + 2cB)/12)\nQB = 200 - ((1200 - 800 + cA - 2cB)/12) - 2((800 - 300 - cA + 2cB)/12)\n\nStep 10: Solve for QA and QB.\nQA = (600 - cA + 2cB)/3\nQB = (300 - cA + cB)/3\n\nStep 11: Substitute the values of QA and QB back into the profit functions to find the optimal profits for both companies.\nπA = ((1200 - 800 + cA - 2cB)/12) * (600 - cA + 2cB)/3 - cA * (600 - cA + 2cB)/3\nπB = ((800 - 300 - cA + 2cB)/12) * (300 - cA + cB)/3 - cB * (300 - cA + cB)/3\n\nThe optimal production levels and profits for both companies depend on the cost parameters cA and cB. To find the specific values, you would need to know the cost functions for both companies."
