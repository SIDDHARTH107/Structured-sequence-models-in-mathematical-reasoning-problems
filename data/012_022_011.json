    "message_2": "The smallest number of people needed in a party to guarantee either three people who all know each other or three people where none of them know each other is given by the Ramsey number R(3,3). The Ramsey number R(3,3) is equal to 6. Therefore, you need at least 6 people in the party to guarantee this condition."
