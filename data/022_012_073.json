    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two zeros: z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nNow, to find the poles of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\nz^2 = -1\n\nThis gives us two poles: z = i and z = -i, where i is the imaginary unit (i.e., i^2 = -1).\n\nTo determine whether each pole is removable, simple, or of higher order, we can look at the order of the zero in the numerator and the order of the pole in the denominator. In this case, both zeros (z = 1 and z = -1) have order 1, as they are both simple zeros. Similarly, both poles (z = i and z = -i) have order 1, as they are both simple poles.\n\nIn conclusion, f(z) has two simple zeros at z = 1 and z = -1, and two simple poles at z = i and z = -i."
