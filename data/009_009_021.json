    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle confined to a one-dimensional box, we need to consider the time-independent Schrödinger equation, which is given by:\n\n-(ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) + V(x) * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, V(x) is the potential energy, ψ(x) is the wave function, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nFor a particle in a box, the potential energy V(x) is 0 inside the box (0 < x < L) and infinity outside the box. Therefore, the wave function ψ(x) is zero outside the box, and we only need to solve the equation inside the box:\n\n-(ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = E * ψ(x)\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k is related to the energy E by:\n\nk^2 = 2mE / ħ^2\n\nSince the wave function must be zero at the boundaries of the box (x = 0 and x = L), we can apply the boundary conditions:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nThe second condition implies that kL = n * π, where n is an integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). This gives us the quantized energy levels:\n\nE_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nm = 2 g = 2 * 10^(-3) kg\nL = 5 nm = 5 * 10^(-9) m\nn = 1 (ground state)\n\nThe reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 1.0545718 * 10^(-34) Js.\n\nE_1 = (1^2 * π^2 * (1.0545718 * 10^(-34))^2) / (2 * 2 * 10^(-3) * (5 * 10^(-9))^2)\nE_1 ≈ 1.2375 * 10^(-19) J\n\nTo convert the energy to electron volts (eV), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.60218 * 10^(-19) J:\n\nE_1 ≈ (1.2375 * 10^(-19) J) / (1.60218 * 10^(-19) J/eV)\nE_1 ≈ 0.772 eV\n\nThe ground state energy of the particle is approximately 0.772 eV. The wave function for the ground state (n = 1) is:\n\nψ_1(x) = A * sin(πx / L)\n\nTo find the constant A, we need to normalize the wave function:\n\n∫[ψ_1(x)]^2 dx = 1\n\nA^2 * ∫[sin^2(πx / L)] dx = 1\n\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, L]. Solving for A, we get:\n\nA = sqrt(2 / L)\n\nSo, the normalized wave function for the ground state is:\n\nψ_1(x) = sqrt(2 / L) * sin(πx / L)\n\nIn this case, L = 5 nm, so the wave function is:\n\nψ_1(x) = sqrt(2 / (5 * 10^(-9))) * sin(πx / (5 * 10^(-9)))\n\nIn conclusion, the ground state energy of the particle is approximately 0.772 eV, and the wave function for the ground state is given by:\n\nψ_1(x) = sqrt(2 / (5 * 10^(-9))) * sin(πx / (5 * 10^(-9)))"
