    "message_1": "A cube has a surface area of 96 cm². What is the length of one of its edges?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. The surface area of a cube is given by the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 * (edge length)²\n\nWe are given the surface area as 96 cm². To find the edge length, we can rearrange the formula and solve for the edge length:\n\n(edge length)² = Surface area / 6\n(edge length)² = 96 cm² / 6\n(edge length)² = 16 cm²\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the edge length:\n\nedge length = √(16 cm²)\nedge length = 4 cm\n\nSo, the length of one edge of the cube is 4 cm."
