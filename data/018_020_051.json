    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between set A and set B (A Δ B). The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6}\nIntersection of A and B = {3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the elements that are in either A or B but not in their intersection:\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNext, we need to find the union of (A Δ B) and A. The union of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets.\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSo, (A Δ B) ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}."
