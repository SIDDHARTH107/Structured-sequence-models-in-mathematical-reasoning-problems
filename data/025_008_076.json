    "message_2": "To find the number of rational curves of degree 3 contained in the given curve, we can use the technique of counting the number of points in the intersection of the curve with a general curve of degree 3. This can be done using the intersection theory and the concept of virtual classes.\n\nLet $C$ be the given curve, and let $H$ be a general hyperplane section of $C$. By the degree-genus formula, we have that the genus of $C$ is given by $g(C) = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = 3$. Since $C$ is a curve of degree 4, we have that $C \\cdot H = 4$. Let $N_d$ be the number of degree $d$ rational curves contained in $C$. We want to compute $N_3$.\n\nConsider the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{0,0}(C, 3)$ of stable maps from genus 0 curves to $C$ of degree 3. The expected dimension of this space is given by the formula $e = 3(4-1) - 3(1-0) = 9$. Let $[C]^{\\text{vir}}$ be the virtual fundamental class of this moduli space. Then, by the virtual localization formula, we have that $N_3 = \\int_{[C]^{\\text{vir}}} 1$.\n\nNow, we can compute the virtual fundamental class using the virtual tangent bundle of the moduli space. The virtual tangent bundle is given by the difference of two vector bundles: the tangent bundle of the moduli space and the obstruction bundle. The tangent bundle can be computed using the deformation theory of stable maps, and the obstruction bundle can be computed using the normal bundle of the curve $C$.\n\nIn our case, the virtual tangent bundle is given by $T^{\\text{vir}} = T - O = 9 - 3 = 6$. Therefore, the virtual fundamental class is given by $[C]^{\\text{vir}} = c_6(T^{\\text{vir}})$. To compute the integral of the top Chern class, we can use the splitting principle and the Chern class axioms. We have that $c_6(T^{\\text{vir}}) = (1 + x)^6$, where $x$ is a formal variable. Expanding this expression, we get $c_6(T^{\\text{vir}}) = 1 + 6x + 15x^2 + 20x^3 + 15x^4 + 6x^5 + x^6$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the number of degree 3 rational curves contained in $C$ by evaluating the integral of the top Chern class: $N_3 = \\int_{[C]^{\\text{vir}}} 1 = \\int c_6(T^{\\text{vir}}) = 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64$.\n\nTherefore, there are 64 rational curves of degree 3 contained in the given curve."
