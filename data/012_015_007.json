    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In our case, n = 8.\n\nMinimum number of edges for a connected graph with 8 vertices = 8 - 1 = 7 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 10 edges, which is more than the minimum required number of edges (7), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, just because it has more than the minimum number of edges doesn't guarantee that it is connected.\n\nTo be sure, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the edges and vertices in the graph. Without that information, we cannot definitively determine whether the graph is connected or not."
