    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to predict how much revenue they will generate based on the number of employees they have. They collect data from 10 previous years, where the number of employees ranged from 5 to 25 and the revenue ranged from $50,000 to $200,000. Using regression analysis, they determine that the equation for their linear regression model is: \n\nY = 5000X + 100000 \n\n(where Y is the revenue in dollars and X is the number of employees)\n\nWhat is the predicted revenue for the company if they have 15 employees?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted revenue for the company with 15 employees, we can plug the value of X (number of employees) into the linear regression equation:\n\nY = 5000 * 15 + 100000\n\nY = 75000 + 100000\n\nY = 175000\n\nThe predicted revenue for the company with 15 employees is $175,000."
