    "message_1": "A system of linear equations is given by:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n\n6x + 4y = 14\n\nThis system of equations has a singular matrix. What is the value of x and y in this system of equations?",
    "message_2": "This system of linear equations is dependent, meaning that the two equations represent the same line. To see this, notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation:\n\n(2)(3x + 2y) = (2)(7)\n\n6x + 4y = 14\n\nSince the two equations represent the same line, there are infinitely many solutions for x and y that will satisfy the system. To find the relationship between x and y, we can solve for y in terms of x (or vice versa) from one of the equations. Using the first equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n\n2y = 7 - 3x\n\ny = (7 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, for any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y that satisfies the system of equations. There is no unique solution for x and y in this case."
