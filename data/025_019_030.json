    "message_2": "To find the number of lines on a smooth complex Fano variety X of dimension 3 with Picard rank 1 and degree 6, we can use the genus formula for Fano 3-folds. The genus formula is given by:\n\ng(X) = (K_X^3 + 6)/12,\n\nwhere g(X) is the genus of X, K_X is the canonical divisor of X, and K_X^3 is the self-intersection number of the canonical divisor.\n\nSince X is a Fano variety, we know that K_X is anti-ample, which means that -K_X is an ample divisor. The degree of X is given by the intersection number of the anti-canonical divisor:\n\ndeg(X) = (-K_X)^3 = 6.\n\nNow, we can use the genus formula to find the self-intersection number of the canonical divisor:\n\nK_X^3 = 12 * g(X) - 6.\n\nTo find the number of lines on X, we can use the following formula:\n\nN_1(X) = (-K_X)^3 - K_X^3,\n\nwhere N_1(X) is the number of lines on X.\n\nSubstituting the degree of X into the formula, we get:\n\nN_1(X) = 6 - K_X^3.\n\nNow, we need to find the genus g(X). Since X is a Fano variety of dimension 3 with Picard rank 1, it is known that g(X) = 0 (see, for example, the book \"Fano 3-folds in P^5\" by Iskovskikh and Prokhorov). Therefore, we have:\n\nK_X^3 = 12 * 0 - 6 = -6.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of lines on X:\n\nN_1(X) = 6 - (-6) = 12.\n\nSo, there are 12 lines on the smooth complex Fano variety X of dimension 3 with Picard rank 1 and degree 6."
