    "message_1": "A stream cipher uses a key of length 10 bits to encrypt a message. If the key is chosen at random, how many possible keys are there?",
    "message_2": "A key of length 10 bits means there are 10 binary positions, each of which can be either a 0 or a 1. To find the total number of possible keys, we calculate 2 raised to the power of the number of bits (10 in this case).\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\nSo, there are 1024 possible keys for this stream cipher."
