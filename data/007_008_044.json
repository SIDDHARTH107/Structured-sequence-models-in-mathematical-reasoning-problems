    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the remainder when 27^9 is divided by 13. Since 13 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nFirst, let's simplify 27 (mod 13). Since 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13), we can rewrite the expression as 1^9.\n\nNow, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n1^(13-1) ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nSince 1^9 is a power of 1^(13-1), we can conclude that 1^9 ≡ 1 (mod 13).\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 27^9 is divided by 13 is 1."
