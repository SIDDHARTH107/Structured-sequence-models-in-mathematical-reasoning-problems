Let H be the subgroup of G generated by a rotation of 72 degrees clockwise and a reflection about the line containing two adjacent vertices. Prove that H is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.",
    "message_2": "To prove that H is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, we need to show that H has the same structure as D10. The dihedral group D10 consists of 10 elements, which are the symmetries of a regular pentagon. These elements include five rotations (identity, 72°, 144°, 216°, and 288°) and five reflections about the lines containing two adjacent vertices.\n\nLet's denote the rotation of 72 degrees clockwise as r and the reflection about the line containing two adjacent vertices as s. We can generate all the elements of H using these two elements:\n\n1. Identity: e = r^0\n2. Rotation 72°: r\n3. Rotation 144°: r^2\n4. Rotation 216°: r^3\n5. Rotation 288°: r^4\n6. Reflection about line containing two adjacent vertices: s\n7. Reflection followed by rotation 72°: sr = r^4s\n8. Reflection followed by rotation 144°: sr^2 = r^3s\n9. Reflection followed by rotation 216°: sr^3 = r^2s\n10. Reflection followed by rotation 288°: sr^4 = rs\n\nNow let's check the relations between r and s to see if they match the relations in D10:\n\n1. r^5 = e (since there are five rotations)\n2. s^2 = e (since reflecting twice is the same as doing nothing)\n3. (sr)^2 = e (since reflecting, rotating, reflecting back, and rotating back is the same as doing nothing)\n\nThese relations match the relations in D10, so H is indeed isomorphic to D10."
