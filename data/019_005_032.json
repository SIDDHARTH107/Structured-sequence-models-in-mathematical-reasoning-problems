    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve on epistemic logic: \n\nSuppose Amy and Bob each have a positive integer in their head, and they know that the sum of their numbers is either 5, 6, or 7. Amy announces, \"I don't know your number.\" Next, Bob announces, \"I don't know your number either.\" Given this information, what is the product of their two numbers?",
    "message_2": "Let's list all possible pairs of positive integers that sum up to 5, 6, or 7:\n\nSum = 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)\nSum = 6: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1)\nSum = 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)\n\nWhen Amy says she doesn't know Bob's number, it means her number can't be 1, because if it were, she would know that Bob's number is either 4 (sum = 5) or 5 (sum = 6). So we can eliminate the pairs with Amy's number as 1:\n\nRemaining pairs: (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)\n\nWhen Bob says he doesn't know Amy's number, it means his number can't be 1 either, because if it were, he would know that Amy's number is either 4 (sum = 5) or 6 (sum = 7). So we can eliminate the pairs with Bob's number as 1:\n\nRemaining pairs: (2,3), (3,2), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2)\n\nNow, Amy knows that Bob's number can't be 1, so she can eliminate the pairs with Bob's number as 1 as well. If Amy's number were 2, she would still not know Bob's number, because it could be either 3 (sum = 5) or 4 (sum = 6). If Amy's number were 3, she would know that Bob's number is 4 (sum = 7), but she already said she doesn't know Bob's number. So Amy's number can't be 3. We can eliminate the pairs with Amy's number as 3:\n\nRemaining pairs: (2,3), (2,4), (4,2), (2,5), (4,3), (5,2)\n\nNow, Bob knows that Amy's number can't be 3, so he can eliminate the pairs with Amy's number as 3 as well. If Bob's number were 2, he would still not know Amy's number, because it could be either 2 (sum = 4) or 4 (sum = 6). If Bob's number were 3, he would know that Amy's number is 2 (sum = 5), but he already said he doesn't know Amy's number. So Bob's number can't be 3. We can eliminate the pairs with Bob's number as 3:\n\nRemaining pairs: (2,4), (4,2), (2,5), (5,2)\n\nAt this point, both Amy and Bob know that the only remaining possibilities are (2,4), (4,2), (2,5), and (5,2). Since they both don't know each other's numbers, the only possibility left is that their numbers are symmetric, meaning the pair is either (2,4) or (4,2). In either case, the product of their two numbers is 2 * 4 = 8."
