    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) on the interval [0, 9], we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 9] √(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 9] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + (9/4)x, then du/dx = 9/4, and dx = (4/9)du.\n\nNow, we need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nWhen x = 0, u = 1 + (9/4)(0) = 1\nWhen x = 9, u = 1 + (9/4)(9) = 1 + 81/4 = 85/4\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 85/4] √(u) * (4/9) du\n\nL = (4/9) ∫[1, 85/4] u^(1/2) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 85/4]\n\nL = (8/27) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 85/4]\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nL = (8/27) * ((85/4)^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (8/27) * ((85/4)^(3/2) - 1)\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value:\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * (22.677 - 1)\nL ≈ (8/27) * 21.677\nL ≈ 6.422\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) on the interval [0, 9] is approximately 6.422 units."
