    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the complement of this Cartesian product. Next, find the Cartesian product of the complements of A and B. Finally, show that the two Cartesian products are not equal, proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of this Cartesian product. To do this, we need to define the universal set U. Let's assume that the universal set U contains all ordered pairs of integers (x, y) where x and y are between 1 and 4, inclusive. Then, the complement of A x B, denoted as (A x B)', is the set of all ordered pairs in U that are not in A x B.\n\n(A x B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNext, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B', respectively. \n\nA' = {3, 4}\nB' = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the complements of A and B, denoted as A' x B'.\n\nA' x B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nFinally, let's compare the two Cartesian products we found: (A x B)' and A' x B'. \n\n(A x B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\nA' x B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B)' and A' x B' are not equal. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
