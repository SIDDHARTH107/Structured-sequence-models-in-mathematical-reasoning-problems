    "message_1": "Suppose there are three different brands of smartphones in the market: Brand A, Brand B, and Brand C. A survey was conducted to find out the average battery life (in hours) of each brand. The survey recorded the battery life of 10 units of each brand. The data collected is given below:\n\nBrand A: 8, 9, 7, 10, 8, 7, 6, 9, 9, 10 \nBrand B: 11, 12, 10, 13, 10, 11, 12, 13, 11, 12 \nBrand C: 6, 7, 5, 8, 7, 6, 4, 7, 7, 8\n\nCan you determine if there is a significant difference in the average battery life of the three brands of smartphones at a significance level of 5%?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the average battery life of the three brands of smartphones at a significance level of 5%, we can perform a one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean battery life for each brand:\n\nBrand A: (8+9+7+10+8+7+6+9+9+10)/10 = 83/10 = 8.3 hours\nBrand B: (11+12+10+13+10+11+12+13+11+12)/10 = 115/10 = 11.5 hours\nBrand C: (6+7+5+8+7+6+4+7+7+8)/10 = 65/10 = 6.5 hours\n\nNext, we need to calculate the overall mean battery life:\n\nTotal battery life: 83 + 115 + 65 = 263\nTotal number of smartphones: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30\nOverall mean battery life: 263/30 ≈ 8.77 hours\n\nNow, we need to calculate the Sum of Squares Within (SSW) and Sum of Squares Between (SSB):\n\nSSW (Brand A) = (8-8.3)^2 + (9-8.3)^2 + ... + (10-8.3)^2 = 14.1\nSSW (Brand B) = (11-11.5)^2 + (12-11.5)^2 + ... + (12-11.5)^2 = 14.5\nSSW (Brand C) = (6-6.5)^2 + (7-6.5)^2 + ... + (8-6.5)^2 = 14.5\nTotal SSW = 14.1 + 14.5 + 14.5 = 43.1\n\nSSB = 10*(8.3-8.77)^2 + 10*(11.5-8.77)^2 + 10*(6.5-8.77)^2 = 150.7\n\nNow, we need to calculate the degrees of freedom:\n\ndf_within = Total number of smartphones - Number of brands = 30 - 3 = 27\ndf_between = Number of brands - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nNext, we calculate the Mean Squares Within (MSW) and Mean Squares Between (MSB):\n\nMSW = SSW/df_within = 43.1/27 ≈ 1.596\nMSB = SSB/df_between = 150.7/2 = 75.35\n\nNow, we can calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB/MSW = 75.35/1.596 ≈ 47.22\n\nFinally, we compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table at a significance level of 5% (α = 0.05) with df_within = 27 and df_between = 2. The critical value is F(2, 27; 0.05) ≈ 3.35.\n\nSince the F-statistic (47.22) is greater than the critical value (3.35), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the average battery life of the three brands of smartphones. Therefore, there is a significant difference in the average battery life of the three brands at a significance level of 5%."
