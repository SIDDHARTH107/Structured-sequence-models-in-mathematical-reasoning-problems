    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the investment, we will calculate the value of the investment in each scenario and multiply it by the probability of that scenario occurring. Then, we will sum up these values.\n\n1. The stock increases in value by 10%:\nProbability: 60% (0.6)\nInvestment value: $1,000 * 1.10 = $1,100\n\n2. The stock decreases in value by 5%:\nProbability: 30% (0.3)\nInvestment value: $1,000 * 0.95 = $950\n\n3. The stock remains the same:\nProbability: 10% (0.1)\nInvestment value: $1,000\n\nNow, we will multiply the investment value by the probability for each scenario and sum them up:\n\nExpected value = (0.6 * $1,100) + (0.3 * $950) + (0.1 * $1,000)\nExpected value = $660 + $285 + $100\nExpected value = $1,045\n\nThe expected value of your investment after these changes in stock price occur is $1,045."
