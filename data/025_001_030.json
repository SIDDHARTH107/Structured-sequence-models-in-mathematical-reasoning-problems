    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points between two curves defined by polynomial equations of degrees m and n is at most m * n, counting multiplicities and complex points.\n\nIn this case, the first equation is a circle with degree 2 (since the highest power of x or y is 2), and the second equation is a linear equation with degree 1 (since the highest power of x or y is 1).\n\nSo, according to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points between these two curves is at most 2 * 1 = 2."
