    "message_1": "A metal ring has a diameter of 8 centimeters and a cross-sectional radius of 2 centimeters. Find the volume of the resulting torus formed by rotating the ring about an axis that is 6 centimeters away from the center of the ring.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the ring to the axis of rotation (6 centimeters) and r is the cross-sectional radius of the ring (2 centimeters).\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 6 * 2^2\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 6 * 4\nVolume = 48 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the resulting torus is approximately 48π^2 cubic centimeters."
