    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set {} is a subset of the set {1, 2, 3}, we can use set builder notation. \n\nLet A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {}. We want to show that B ⊆ A.\n\nIn set builder notation, we can represent A as:\n\nA = {x | x ∈ ℕ and 1 ≤ x ≤ 3}\n\nNow, for B to be a subset of A, every element in B must also be an element of A. Since B is the empty set, it has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in B that are not in A.\n\nBy definition, the empty set is a subset of any set, including A. Thus, B ⊆ A, and we have proven that the empty set {} is a subset of the set {1, 2, 3}."
