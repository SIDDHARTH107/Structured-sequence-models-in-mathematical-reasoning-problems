    "message_2": "To solve the equation log₂(x+1) + log₂(2x-1) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that logₐ(m) + logₐ(n) = logₐ(mn) for any positive real numbers m and n and any positive real number a ≠ 1. Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog₂((x+1)(2x-1)) = 3\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n2^3 = (x+1)(2x-1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n8 = 2x² - x + 2x - 1\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as a quadratic equation:\n\n2x² + x - 8 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring works:\n\n(2x - 4)(x + 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - 4 = 0  or  x + 2 = 0\n\nx = 2  or  x = -2\n\nHowever, we must check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation:\n\nFor x = 2:\n\nlog₂(2+1) + log₂(2(2)-1) = log₂(3) + log₂(3) = 3\n\nThis solution is valid.\n\nFor x = -2:\n\nlog₂(-2+1) + log₂(2(-2)-1) = log₂(-1) + log₂(-5)\n\nSince the logarithm of a negative number is undefined, this solution is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for x is x = 2."
