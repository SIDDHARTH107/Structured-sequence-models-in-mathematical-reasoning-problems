    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at x = 2, we need to find the first and second derivatives of the position function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, which represents the velocity function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1)\n\nUsing the power rule, we have:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, which represents the acceleration function:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 6x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule again, we have:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 6\n\nNow we can find the velocity and acceleration at x = 2:\n\nVelocity at x = 2:\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 6(2) + 2\nf'(2) = 3(4) - 12 + 2\nf'(2) = 12 - 12 + 2\nf'(2) = 2\n\nAcceleration at x = 2:\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 6\nf''(2) = 12 - 6\nf''(2) = 6\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at x = 2 is 2, and the acceleration is 6."
