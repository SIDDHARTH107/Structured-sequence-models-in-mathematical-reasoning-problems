    "message_2": "To find the number of different combinations of toppings, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of toppings (5 in this case) and k is the number of toppings to be chosen (3 in this case).\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\nC(5, 3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1)(2 * 1))\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nThere are 10 different combinations of toppings for a pizza with three toppings."
