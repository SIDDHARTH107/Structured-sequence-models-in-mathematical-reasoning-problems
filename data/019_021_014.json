    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, Player A winning a round)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10 rounds)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 7 wins for Player A)\n\nWe want to find the probability of Player A winning at least 7 rounds, so we need to calculate the probabilities for 7, 8, 9, and 10 wins and then sum them up.\n\nLet p = 0.6 (Player A's winning probability) and n = 10.\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.6^7 * 0.4^3\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.6^8 * 0.4^2\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.6^9 * 0.4^1\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.6^10 * 0.4^0\n\nNow we calculate the combinations:\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * 2!) = 45\nC(10, 9) = 10! / (9! * 1!) = 10\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10! * 0!) = 1\n\nNow we calculate the probabilities:\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.6^7 * 0.4^3 ≈ 0.2149908\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.6^8 * 0.4^2 ≈ 0.1209324\nP(X = 9) = 10 * 0.6^9 * 0.4^1 ≈ 0.0403108\nP(X = 10) = 1 * 0.6^10 * 0.4^0 ≈ 0.0060466\n\nNow we sum up the probabilities:\nP(X ≥ 7) = P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) ≈ 0.2149908 + 0.1209324 + 0.0403108 + 0.0060466 ≈ 0.3822806\n\nSo, the probability that Player A will win at least 7 out of the 10 rounds is approximately 0.3823 or 38.23%."
