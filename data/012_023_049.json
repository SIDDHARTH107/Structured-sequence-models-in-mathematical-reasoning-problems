    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. In this case, the clique number is 3, which means the largest complete subgraph has 3 completely connected vertices.\n\nSince the total number of vertices in the graph is 8, we can have multiple cliques of size 3. However, we cannot have a larger clique, as that would increase the clique number.\n\nThe maximum number of completely connected vertices in this graph would be achieved by having disjoint cliques of size 3. In this case, we can have two disjoint cliques of size 3, which would cover 6 vertices. The remaining 2 vertices cannot be part of a larger clique, as that would increase the clique number.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of completely connected vertices in this graph is 6."
