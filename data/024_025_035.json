    "message_2": "To prove that $c_1(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{X}Tr(F_{E}^2)$, we will first recall some definitions and facts about Chern classes and curvature forms.\n\nThe first Chern class $c_1(E)$ of a complex vector bundle $E$ is a topological invariant that measures the twisting of the bundle. It is an element of the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe curvature form $F_E$ of a holomorphic vector bundle $E$ is a closed $(1,1)$-form on $X$ associated with a Hermitian connection on $E$. It is a matrix-valued form, and its trace, $Tr(F_E)$, is a scalar $(1,1)$-form.\n\nNow, let's prove the formula for the first Chern class. We will use the Chern-Weil theory, which relates the Chern classes of a complex vector bundle to the curvature form of a Hermitian connection on the bundle.\n\nBy Chern-Weil theory, we have that the first Chern class of $E$ can be expressed as\n$$\nc_1(E) = \\frac{i}{2\\pi}Tr(F_E),\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit. Note that this formula gives the first Chern class as a cohomology class represented by the closed $(1,1)$-form $\\frac{i}{2\\pi}Tr(F_E)$.\n\nTo compute the integral of the square of the trace of the curvature form, we first square the trace:\n$$\nTr(F_E^2) = Tr(F_E) \\cdot Tr(F_E).\n$$\n\nNow, we integrate this form over the complex manifold $X$:\n$$\n\\int_X Tr(F_E^2) = \\int_X Tr(F_E) \\cdot Tr(F_E).\n$$\n\nUsing the fact that the integral of a product of closed forms is equal to the product of the integrals of the forms, we get\n$$\n\\int_X Tr(F_E^2) = \\left(\\int_X Tr(F_E)\\right)^2.\n$$\n\nNow, we can use the expression for the first Chern class in terms of the trace of the curvature form:\n$$\n\\int_X Tr(F_E^2) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{i}c_1(E)\\right)^2.\n$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the first Chern class $c_1(E)$:\n$$\nc_1(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_X Tr(F_E^2).\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof that $c_1(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{X}Tr(F_{E}^2)$ for a complex manifold $X$ of complex dimension 2 with a holomorphic vector bundle $E$ of rank 3."
