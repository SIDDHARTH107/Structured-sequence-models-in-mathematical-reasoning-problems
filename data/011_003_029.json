If he has to deliver the mail to 8 different houses, how many different ways can he choose the routes so that he uses a different route for each house? Use Pascal's triangle to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's triangle, we need to find the number of combinations of choosing 8 houses from the 5 routes. This can be represented as C(12, 8), which means choosing 8 houses from a total of 12 options (5 routes + 8 houses - 1).\n\nPascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top, and the outer edges of the triangle are always 1. The nth row of Pascal's triangle represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (x+y)^n.\n\nTo find the value of C(12, 8), we need to look at the 13th row of Pascal's triangle (since the first row is considered row 0) and find the 9th entry (since the first entry is considered entry 0).\n\nHere are the first 13 rows of Pascal's triangle:\n\n```\n               1\n              1 1\n             1 2 1\n            1 3 3 1\n           1 4 6 4 1\n          1 5 10 10 5 1\n         1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n        1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n       1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1\n      1 9 36 84 126 126 84 36 9 1\n    1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1\n   1 11 55 165 330 462 462 330 165 55 11 1\n  1 12 66 220 495 792 924 792 495 220 66 12 1\n```\n\nThe 13th row is: 1 12 66 220 495 792 924 792 495 220 66 12 1\n\nThe 9th entry in this row is 495.\n\nSo, there are 495 different ways the mailman can choose the routes to deliver the mail to the 8 houses using a different route for each house."
