    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 2x + 3 from x = 1 to x = 5, we will integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral between the given limits.\n\nFirst, let's find the antiderivative of the function y = 2x + 3:\n\nâˆ«(2x + 3) dx = x^2 + 3x + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the definite integral between the limits x = 1 and x = 5:\n\nArea = [x^2 + 3x] (from x = 1 to x = 5)\n\nArea = (5^2 + 3*5) - (1^2 + 3*1)\nArea = (25 + 15) - (1 + 3)\nArea = 40 - 4\nArea = 36\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 2x + 3 from x = 1 to x = 5 is 36 square units."
