    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we need to compute the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t). The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[h(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nFor our given impulse response h(t) = 3e^(-2t)u(t), we have:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[3e^(-2t)u(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nSince u(t) is the unit step function, it is equal to 1 for t ≥ 0 and 0 for t < 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[3e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, we can combine the exponential terms:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[3e^((-2-jω)t)] dt, from 0 to infinity.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by substitution. Let x = -2 - jω, then:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[3e^(xt)] dt, from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, integrate with respect to t:\n\nH(ω) = (-3/x)e^(xt) | from 0 to infinity\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nH(ω) = (-3/x)e^(xt) | from 0 to infinity = (-3/x)e^(∞) - (-3/x)e^(0) = 0 - (-3/x) = 3/x\n\nSo, the frequency response of the system is:\n\nH(ω) = 3/(-2 - jω)\n\nNow, we need to find the gain of the frequency response at ω = 2 rad/s. The gain is the magnitude of the frequency response:\n\nGain = |H(ω)|\n\nAt ω = 2 rad/s:\n\nGain = |H(2)| = |3/(-2 - j2)|\n\nTo find the magnitude, we can use the formula |a + jb| = √(a^2 + b^2):\n\nGain = √(3^2 / ((-2)^2 + (2)^2)) = √(9 / 8)\n\nSo, the gain of the frequency response at ω = 2 rad/s is:\n\nGain ≈ √(9 / 8)"
