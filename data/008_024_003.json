    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can first observe that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n3x + 2y = 8\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n3x + 2y = 8\n3x + 2y = 8\n\nSince both equations represent the same line, there are infinitely many solutions that satisfy both equations. To express the solutions, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\n2y = 8 - 3x\ny = (8 - 3x)/2\n\nSo the solutions to this system of linear equations can be expressed as:\n\n(x, (8 - 3x)/2) for any value of x."
