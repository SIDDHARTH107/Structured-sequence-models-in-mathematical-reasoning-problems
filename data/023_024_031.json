    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series coefficients of the given function, we'll first express the function as a Fourier series. Since the function is odd, we only need to consider the sine terms in the Fourier series. The general form of the Fourier series for an odd function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere b_n are the Fourier coefficients. To find the coefficients b_n, we'll use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2 / T) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * x)) dx, integrated over one period T (in this case, T = 2π)\n\nFor the given function, we have two cases to consider for the integral:\n\n1) 0 < x < π: f(x) = 1\n2) π < x < 2π: f(x) = -1\n\nLet's find b_n for each case and then sum them up.\n\nCase 1: 0 < x < π\nb_n1 = (2 / 2π) * ∫(1 * sin(n * x)) dx, integrated from 0 to π\nb_n1 = (1 / π) * ∫(sin(n * x)) dx, integrated from 0 to π\nb_n1 = (1 / π) * [-cos(n * x) / n] evaluated from 0 to π\nb_n1 = (1 / π) * [-cos(n * π) / n + cos(0) / n]\nb_n1 = (1 / π) * (-1)^n / n\n\nCase 2: π < x < 2π\nb_n2 = (2 / 2π) * ∫(-1 * sin(n * x)) dx, integrated from π to 2π\nb_n2 = (-1 / π) * ∫(sin(n * x)) dx, integrated from π to 2π\nb_n2 = (-1 / π) * [-cos(n * x) / n] evaluated from π to 2π\nb_n2 = (-1 / π) * [-cos(2 * n * π) / n + cos(n * π) / n]\nb_n2 = (-1 / π) * (1 / n - (-1)^n / n)\n\nNow, we sum up the coefficients from both cases:\n\nb_n = b_n1 + b_n2\nb_n = (1 / π) * (-1)^n / n + (-1 / π) * (1 / n - (-1)^n / n)\nb_n = (1 / π) * (-1)^n / n - 1 / n + (-1)^n / n\nb_n = (1 / π) * (-1)^n / n - 1 / πn\n\nSo, the Fourier series for the given function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[((1 / π) * (-1)^n / n - 1 / πn) * sin(n * x)]"
