    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t), and let F{·} denote the Fourier transform. The given differential equation is:\n\ny''(t) + 4y(t) = 2t\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:\n\nF{y''(t)} + 4F{y(t)} = F{2t}\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we know that the Fourier transform of the second derivative is given by:\n\nF{y''(t)} = (iω)^2Y(ω) = -ω^2Y(ω)\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n-ω^2Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = F{2t}\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = F{2t} / (4 - ω^2)\n\nTo find the Fourier transform of 2t, we use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF{2t} = ∫(2t * e^(-iωt)) dt, from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral can be solved using integration by parts. Let u = 2t and dv = e^(-iωt) dt. Then, du = 2 dt and v = -1/(iω) * e^(-iωt). Applying integration by parts:\n\nF{2t} = -2t/(iω) * e^(-iωt) | from -∞ to ∞ + ∫(2/(iω) * e^(-iωt)) dt, from -∞ to ∞\n\nThe first term goes to 0 as t goes to ±∞. The second term is a simple integral:\n\nF{2t} = 2/(iω) * ∫(e^(-iωt)) dt, from -∞ to ∞ = 2/(iω) * [-1/(iω) * e^(-iωt)] | from -∞ to ∞\n\nF{2t} = 2/(ω^2) [e^(-iωt)] | from -∞ to ∞ = 2π/(ω^2) * δ(ω)\n\nHere, δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function. Now, we can substitute this back into the equation for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = (2π/(ω^2) * δ(ω)) / (4 - ω^2)\n\nFinally, we take the inverse Fourier transform to find y(t):\n\ny(t) = F^(-1){Y(ω)} = F^(-1){(2π/(ω^2) * δ(ω)) / (4 - ω^2)}\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) * ∫((2π/(ω^2) * δ(ω)) / (4 - ω^2) * e^(iωt)) dω, from -∞ to ∞\n\nThe integral is non-zero only when ω = 0, so we can simplify the integral:\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) * (2π/4) * e^(i(0)t) = 1/4\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1. To satisfy the initial conditions, we need to add a particular solution to the homogeneous equation. The particular solution is given by:\n\ny_p(t) = 1/2 * t^2\n\nThe general solution is then:\n\ny(t) = y_p(t) + y_h(t) = 1/2 * t^2 + 1/4\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 1/2 * 0^2 + 1/4 = 0\ny'(t) = t + 0\n\ny'(0) = 0 + 0 = 1\n\nThus, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = 1/2 * t^2 + 1/4"
