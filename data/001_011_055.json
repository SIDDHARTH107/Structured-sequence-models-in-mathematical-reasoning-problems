    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2x-1)/(x+4) = 3/5, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(2x - 1) * 5 = (x + 4) * 3\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n10x - 5 = 3x + 12\n\nNext, move all the terms with x to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:\n\n10x - 3x = 12 + 5\n\n7x = 17\n\nFinally, divide by 7 to isolate x:\n\nx = 17/7"
