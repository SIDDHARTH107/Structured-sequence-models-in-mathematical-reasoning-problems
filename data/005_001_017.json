    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs claims that their bulbs have an average lifespan of 1500 hours. A sample of 50 bulbs is taken and it is found that the average lifespan is 1450 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. Is there enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim at a 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average lifespan of the bulbs is 1500 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average lifespan is not 1500 hours.\n\nH0: μ = 1500 hours\nH1: μ ≠ 1500 hours\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 1450 hours\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 100 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 5% = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is large (n > 30), we can use the t-distribution to approximate the z-distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nt = (1450 - 1500) / (100 / √50)\nt = -50 / (100 / √50)\nt = -50 / (100 / 7.071)\nt = -50 / 14.142\nt = -3.536\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49. We can look this up in a t-distribution table or use a calculator:\n\nt_critical = ± 2.009\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.536) is less than the critical t-value (-2.009), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) at a 5% significance level. There is enough evidence to suggest that the average lifespan of the light bulbs is not 1500 hours, and the manufacturer's claim can be rejected."
