    "message_1": "In a Stackelberg competition, a company A is a leader with a first mover advantage and the company B is a follower. If the market demand function is given by P=20-0.5Q, the cost function of company A is C(Qa)=2Qa and the cost function of company B is C(Qb)=2Qb, what will be the equilibrium quantity and price in the market?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity and price in the market, we need to first find the reaction function of company B (the follower) and then find the optimal output for company A (the leader) given company B's reaction function.\n\n1. Find the reaction function of company B:\nTo do this, we first find the profit function for company B: \nπ_B = P * Qb - C(Qb)\nπ_B = (20 - 0.5(Qa + Qb)) * Qb - 2Qb\n\nNow, we find the first-order condition by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to Qb and setting it equal to 0:\ndπ_B/dQb = 20 - 0.5Qa - Qb - 2 = 0\n\nRearranging, we get the reaction function of company B:\nQb = 18 - 0.5Qa\n\n2. Find the optimal output for company A:\nNow, we need to find the profit function for company A, taking into account the reaction function of company B:\nπ_A = P * Qa - C(Qa)\nπ_A = (20 - 0.5(Qa + (18 - 0.5Qa))) * Qa - 2Qa\n\nSimplifying the profit function:\nπ_A = (20 - 0.5Qa - 9 + 0.25Qa) * Qa - 2Qa\nπ_A = (11 + 0.25Qa) * Qa - 2Qa\n\nNow, we find the first-order condition by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to Qa and setting it equal to 0:\ndπ_A/dQa = 11 - 0.25Qa - 2 = 0\n\nRearranging, we get the optimal output for company A:\nQa = 36\n\n3. Find the equilibrium output for company B:\nUsing the reaction function of company B, we can find the equilibrium output for company B:\nQb = 18 - 0.5 * 36\nQb = 18 - 18\nQb = 0\n\n4. Find the equilibrium quantity and price in the market:\nThe equilibrium quantity in the market is the sum of the equilibrium outputs of company A and company B:\nQ = Qa + Qb\nQ = 36 + 0\nQ = 36\n\nThe equilibrium price in the market can be found using the market demand function:\nP = 20 - 0.5 * 36\nP = 20 - 18\nP = 2\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity in the market is 36 units, and the equilibrium price is $2."
