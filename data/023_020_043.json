    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nFind the Fourier series for the following periodic function with period 2π:\n\nf(x) = (sin x)/x       -π < x < 0\n       1                     x = 0\n       (sin x)/x        0 < x < π\n\nFurther, calculate the sum of the series at x=π/4.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nThe coefficients a_n and b_n are given by the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * cos(nx) dx) from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nx) dx) from -π to π\n\nSince the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero. Now, let's find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫((sin x)/x * sin(nx) dx) from -π to π\n\nThis integral can be split into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫((sin x)/x * sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫((sin x)/x * sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve these integrals. Let u = sin x/x and dv = sin nx dx. Then, du = (x * cos x - sin x)/(x^2) dx and v = -cos nx/n.\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-sin x * cos nx/n)|(-π to 0) - ∫(-cos nx * (x * cos x - sin x)/(x^2) dx) from -π to 0 + (-sin x * cos nx/n)|(0 to π) - ∫(-cos nx * (x * cos x - sin x)/(x^2) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nAfter evaluating the integrals, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/n) * [(-1)^n - 1]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series as:\n\nf(x) = Σ((2/n) * [(-1)^n - 1] * sin(nx))\n\nTo calculate the sum of the series at x = π/4, we plug in x = π/4 into the Fourier series:\n\nf(π/4) = Σ((2/n) * [(-1)^n - 1] * sin(nπ/4))\n\nThis series converges, and you can calculate the sum to a desired level of accuracy by taking more terms into account."
