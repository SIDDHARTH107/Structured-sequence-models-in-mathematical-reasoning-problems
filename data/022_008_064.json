    "message_2": "To determine the order of the entire function f(z) = e^(2z) - 3e^z + 2, we first need to understand what an entire function is. An entire function is a function that is holomorphic (analytic) on the entire complex plane. The order of an entire function is the order of growth of the function as the magnitude of the complex variable z approaches infinity.\n\nIn this case, f(z) = e^(2z) - 3e^z + 2 is an entire function because it is a sum of entire functions (exponential functions are entire functions).\n\nNow, let's determine the order of growth of f(z) as |z| approaches infinity. The dominant term in f(z) is e^(2z), as it grows faster than the other terms. The order of growth of e^(2z) is 2, as the exponent is 2z. Therefore, the order of the entire function f(z) = e^(2z) - 3e^z + 2 is 2."
