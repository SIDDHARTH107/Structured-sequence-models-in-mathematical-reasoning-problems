    "message_2": "To solve for z, we first need to get all the z terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting (4 + i)z from both sides:\n\n2z - (4 + i)z + (3 - 2i) = -5i\n\nNow, we can factor out z from the left side of the equation:\n\nz(2 - 4 - i) + (3 - 2i) = -5i\n\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\nz(-2 - i) + (3 - 2i) = -5i\n\nNow, we can isolate z by dividing both sides of the equation by (-2 - i):\n\nz = (3 - 2i) / (-2 - i)\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is (-2 + i):\n\nz = [(3 - 2i) * (-2 + i)] / [(-2 - i) * (-2 + i)]\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerators and denominators:\n\nz = [(-6 + 3i + 4i - 2i^2)] / [(4 - 2i + 2i - i^2)]\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can substitute -1 for i^2:\n\nz = [(-6 + 3i + 4i + 2)] / [(4 + 1)]\n\nSimplify the expressions:\n\nz = (-4 + 7i) / 5\n\nSo, the solution for z is:\n\nz = -4/5 + (7/5)i"
