    "message_2": "First, we need to represent the given system of linear equations as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2  5 |\n    | 2  7  1 |\n    | 5  0  1 |\n\nb = | 20 |\n    | 29 |\n    | 14 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. We want to find a lower triangular matrix L such that A = LL^T.\n\nL = | l11  0    0  |\n    | l21  l22  0  |\n    | l31  l32  l33|\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition formulas, we get:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(3)\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / sqrt(3)\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 5 / sqrt(3)\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(7 - (2 / sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(19/3)\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (0 - (5 / sqrt(3)) * (2 / sqrt(3))) / sqrt(19/3) = -10 / sqrt(19/3)\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(1 - (5 / sqrt(3))^2 - (-10 / sqrt(19/3))^2) = sqrt(8/3)\n\nSo, the lower triangular matrix L is:\n\nL = | sqrt(3)       0          0      |\n    | 2/sqrt(3)  sqrt(19/3)    0      |\n    | 5/sqrt(3)  -10/sqrt(19/3) sqrt(8/3)|\n\nNow, we will solve the equation Ly = b for y:\n\n| sqrt(3)       0          0      | | y1 |   | 20 |\n| 2/sqrt(3)  sqrt(19/3)    0      | | y2 | = | 29 |\n| 5/sqrt(3)  -10/sqrt(19/3) sqrt(8/3)| | y3 |   | 14 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 20 / sqrt(3)\ny2 = (29 - 2/sqrt(3) * y1) / sqrt(19/3) = 3\ny3 = (14 - 5/sqrt(3) * y1 + 10/sqrt(19/3) * y2) / sqrt(8/3) = 2\n\nNow, we will solve the equation L^T x = y for x:\n\n|  sqrt(3)  2/sqrt(3)  5/sqrt(3)  | | x1 |   | 20/sqrt(3) |\n|  0       sqrt(19/3) -10/sqrt(19/3)| | x2 | = |     3     |\n|  0        0         sqrt(8/3)  | | x3 |   |     2     |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx1 = (20/sqrt(3)) / sqrt(3) = 20/3\nx2 = (3 + 10/sqrt(19/3) * x3) / sqrt(19/3) = 1\nx3 = 2 / sqrt(8/3) = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 20/3\ny = 1\nz = 1"
