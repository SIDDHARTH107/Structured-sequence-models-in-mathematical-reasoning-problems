    "message_1": "In a population of 10,000 people, it is known that 2% of them have a certain medical condition. If a doctor randomly selects 100 people from this population, what is the probability that at least 3 of them have this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success in a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 100 (the doctor selects 100 people)\n- p = 0.02 (2% of the population have the medical condition)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 3 of them have the medical condition, which means 3 or more. To do this, we can find the probability of 0, 1, and 2 people having the condition, and then subtract those probabilities from 1.\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 successes:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * (0.02)^0 * (1-0.02)^(100-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (1-0.02)^(100-1)\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * (0.02)^2 * (1-0.02)^(100-2)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.13398\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.27067\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.27189\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 3 people having the medical condition:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2)\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 1 - 0.13398 - 0.27067 - 0.27189\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 0.32346\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 of the 100 randomly selected people have the medical condition is approximately 32.35%."
