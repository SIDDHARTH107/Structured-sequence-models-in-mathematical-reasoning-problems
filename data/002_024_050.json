    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 10 cm, one base is 12 cm long and the other base is 18 cm long. What is the perimeter of this trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the two non-parallel sides (the legs). We can do this by dividing the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter base to the longer base.\n\nLet's call the length of one leg \"a\" and the length of the other leg \"b\". The height of the trapezium (10 cm) will be the height of both right triangles. Let's call the length of the shorter base segment that forms one of the right triangles \"x\" and the length of the longer base segment that forms the other right triangle \"y\". Then, x + y = 18 - 12 = 6 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the legs:\n\na^2 = x^2 + 10^2\nb^2 = y^2 + 10^2\n\nSince we don't have the exact values for x and y, we can't find the exact lengths of a and b. However, we can express the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x and y:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + 12 + 18\nPerimeter = √(x^2 + 10^2) + √(y^2 + 10^2) + 12 + 18\n\nThis is the general formula for the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x and y."
