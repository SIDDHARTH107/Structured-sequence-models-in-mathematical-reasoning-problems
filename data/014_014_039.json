    "message_1": "The Playfair cipher uses a $5 \\times 5$ grid of letters with the keyword \"MATHS\" to encrypt messages. If the message to be encrypted is \"HELLO\", what is the encrypted message? (Assume that the message is in uppercase and that the letter J is not used in the grid.)",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"MATHS\", we first need to create the $5 \\times 5$ grid.\n\n1. Write down the keyword \"MATHS\" without repeating any letters.\n2. Fill in the rest of the grid with the remaining letters of the alphabet in order, skipping any letters already used in the keyword and excluding the letter J.\n\nThe grid will look like this:\n\n```\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n```\n\nNow, we can encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the following rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its immediate right (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter immediately below it (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters are in different rows and columns, replace each with the letter in its own row and the column of the other letter.\n\nFirst, we need to split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a digraph has the same letter twice, insert an X between them. If there's an odd number of letters, add an X at the end. In this case, the message \"HELLO\" can be split into the digraphs \"HE\" and \"LX\".\n\nNow, we can encrypt each digraph using the grid:\n\n- For \"HE\", H is in the same row as E, so we replace H with S and E with F, resulting in \"SF\".\n- For \"LX\", L is in the same column as X, so we replace L with N and X with V, resulting in \"NV\".\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"SFNV\"."
