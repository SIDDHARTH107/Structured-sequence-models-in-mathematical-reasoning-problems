    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3cos(x) + 5x^2sin(x), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\n(d/dx)[u(x)v(x)] = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nLet's apply the product rule to both terms in the function f(x):\n\nFor the first term, x^3cos(x), let u(x) = x^3 and v(x) = cos(x). Then, we have:\n\nu'(x) = d(x^3)/dx = 3x^2\nv'(x) = d(cos(x))/dx = -sin(x)\n\nUsing the product rule, the derivative of the first term is:\n\nd(x^3cos(x))/dx = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x) = (3x^2)(cos(x)) + (x^3)(-sin(x)) = 3x^2cos(x) - x^3sin(x)\n\nNow, for the second term, 5x^2sin(x), let u(x) = 5x^2 and v(x) = sin(x). Then, we have:\n\nu'(x) = d(5x^2)/dx = 10x\nv'(x) = d(sin(x))/dx = cos(x)\n\nUsing the product rule, the derivative of the second term is:\n\nd(5x^2sin(x))/dx = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x) = (10x)(sin(x)) + (5x^2)(cos(x)) = 10xsin(x) + 5x^2cos(x)\n\nFinally, we combine the derivatives of both terms to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = d(x^3cos(x) + 5x^2sin(x))/dx = (3x^2cos(x) - x^3sin(x)) + (10xsin(x) + 5x^2cos(x))\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2cos(x) - x^3sin(x) + 10xsin(x) + 5x^2cos(x)"
