    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a question for a math student to solve:\n\nLaura wants to purchase a painting in an auction. The painting is expected to sell for a price between $500 and $1000. There are three other bidders in the auction, and the auction will be conducted using a second-price sealed-bid auction format. Assuming that all bidders are rational and bid their true valuations, what is the optimal bid Laura should place if her valuation for the painting is $800?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid. Since all bidders are rational and bid their true valuations, Laura should also bid her true valuation, which is $800. This is because if she bids lower than her valuation, she might lose the auction to someone who values the painting less than her, and if she bids higher, she might end up paying more than her valuation if she wins.\n\nSo, the optimal bid for Laura is $800."
