    "message_2": "A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. The maximum number of edges a planar graph can have is determined by Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a planar graph with 6 vertices (V = 6), we can rearrange the formula to find the maximum number of edges (E):\n\nE = V + F - 2\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of edges, we need to maximize the number of faces (F). In a planar graph, each face is bounded by at least 3 edges. Therefore, we can write:\n\n3F ≤ 2E\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for E from Euler's formula:\n\n3F ≤ 2(V + F - 2)\n\n3F ≤ 12 + 2F - 4\n\nF ≤ 8\n\nSo, the maximum number of faces is 8. Now, we can substitute this value back into the expression for E:\n\nE = 6 + 8 - 2\n\nE = 12\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of edges a planar graph can have with 6 vertices is 12."
