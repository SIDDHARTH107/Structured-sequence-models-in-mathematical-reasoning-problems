    "message_1": "A tower is 100 meters tall. From the top of the tower, a person observes a boat in the ocean at an angle of depression of 35 degrees. If the person's eyes are at a height of 1.5 meters above the top of the tower, what is the distance from the tower's base to the boat? (use trigonometry to solve)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance from the tower's base to the boat as x, and the height of the tower plus the person's eye level as h. We have:\n\nh = 100 + 1.5 = 101.5 meters\n\nSince we are given the angle of depression (35 degrees), we can use the tangent function to relate the angle, the height, and the distance. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (distance) in a right triangle. In this case, we have:\n\ntan(35°) = h / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = h / tan(35°)\nx = 101.5 / tan(35°)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the value of the tangent:\n\nx ≈ 101.5 / 0.7002\nx ≈ 144.92 meters\n\nSo, the distance from the tower's base to the boat is approximately 144.92 meters."
