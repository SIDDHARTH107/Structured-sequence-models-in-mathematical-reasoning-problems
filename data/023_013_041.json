    "message_1": "A metal rod with a length of 0.5 meters is initially at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. One end of the rod is exposed to a heat source that keeps it at a constant temperature of 200 degrees Celsius, while the other end is kept at a constant temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. Use the Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution of the rod at any point in time during the heat transfer process.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the rod at any point in time during the heat transfer process, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature distribution of the rod at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = 200°C (constant temperature at one end)\nu(0.5,t) = 50°C (constant temperature at the other end)\n\nAnd the initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = 100°C (initial temperature of the rod)\n\nTo solve this PDE, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = α X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by αXT:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = α X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nα X''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\nT'(t) = -λT(t)\nα X''(x) = -λX(x)\n\nSolving the ODE for X(x), we get:\n\nX''(x) = -(λ/α) X(x)\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = 200 and X(0.5) = 50. The general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A cos(√(λ/α) x) + B sin(√(λ/α) x)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we can find the coefficients A and B, and the eigenvalues λ.\n\nNext, we solve the ODE for T(t):\n\nT'(t) = -λT(t)\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C exp(-λt)\n\nNow, we can write the solution of the heat equation as a sum of the product of X(x) and T(t):\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [ (A cos(√(λ/α) x) + B sin(√(λ/α) x)) * C exp(-λt) ]\n\nTo find the coefficients A, B, and C, we can use the initial condition u(x,0) = 100°C and the Fourier series expansion. This will give us the temperature distribution of the rod at any point in time during the heat transfer process."
