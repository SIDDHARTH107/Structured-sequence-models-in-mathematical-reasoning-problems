Divide the larger number (315) by the smaller number (126) and find the remainder.\n   315 รท 126 = 2 with a remainder of 63.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (315) with the smaller number (126) and the smaller number with the remainder (63).\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n   126 รท 63 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder.\n   In this case, the GCD of 126 and 315 is 63."
