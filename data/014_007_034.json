    "message_2": "To apply the one-time pad technique using the XOR operation, we first need to extend the secret key to match the length of the stream of bits. The secret key is 1101, so we repeat it until it has the same length as the stream of bits: 110111011101.\n\nNow, we perform the XOR operation between the stream of bits and the extended secret key:\n\n1010110110\n1101110111\n----------\n0111000001\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is 0111000001."
