    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = 4x^(3/2) + 2 between x = 0 and x = 4, we will use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx):\n\ny = 4x^(3/2) + 2\ndy/dx = (3/2) * 4x^(1/2) = 6x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we will find (dy/dx)^2:\n\n(6x^(1/2))^2 = 36x\n\nNext, we will plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + 36x) dx\n\nThis integral is not elementary, so we will use a numerical method to approximate the arc length. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integrator:\n\nL ≈ 17.356\n\nTherefore, the arc length of the curve y = 4x^(3/2) + 2 between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 17.356 units."
