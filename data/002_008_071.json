    "message_2": "To find the volume of a right circular cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(4²)(10)\nVolume = (1/3)π(16)(10)\nVolume = (1/3)π(160)\n\nNow, we can multiply the values:\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(160)\nVolume ≈ (1.047197)(160)\nVolume ≈ 167.55168\n\nRounding the answer to two decimal places, the volume of the right circular cone is approximately 167.55 cubic centimeters."
