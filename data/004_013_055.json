Determine the minimum cost of producing the product and the number of units that must be produced to achieve this minimum cost.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of producing the product, we need to find the minimum value of the cost function C(x) = 1000 + 5x^2. To do this, we can find the critical points of the function by taking its derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n\nThe derivative of C(x) with respect to x is:\n\nC'(x) = d/dx (1000 + 5x^2) = 0 + 10x\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n10x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, the critical point occurs at x = 0. To verify that this is a minimum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of C(x) with respect to x is:\n\nC''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (1000 + 5x^2) = 0 + 10\n\nSince the second derivative is positive (C''(x) = 10 > 0), the critical point at x = 0 corresponds to a minimum.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum cost by plugging x = 0 back into the cost function:\n\nC(0) = 1000 + 5(0)^2 = 1000\n\nSo, the minimum cost of producing the product is $1000, and this occurs when no units are produced (x = 0)."
