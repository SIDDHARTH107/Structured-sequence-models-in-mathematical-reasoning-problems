    "message_2": "To prove that the group G of order 20 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems, and then construct the Cayley table for G and verify if it satisfies the defining properties of each of these three groups.\n\n1. Analyzing the structure of G using the Sylow theorems:\n\nThe order of G is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n5) must divide 4 (2^2) and n5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n2) must divide 5 and n2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possibilities for n2 are 1 and 5.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 4. Since P is normal in G, we have G = PQ.\n\n2. Constructing the Cayley table for G:\n\nLet P = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4} and Q = {e, b, b^2, b^3}, where e is the identity element, a has order 5, and b has order 4. The elements of G can be represented as {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b, a^4b, b^2, a^2b^2, a^3b^2, a^4b^2, b^3, a^2b^3, a^3b^3, a^4b^3}. We will now construct the Cayley table for G by computing the products of these elements.\n\n3. Verifying if G satisfies the defining properties of C20, D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20:\n\na) C20: The cyclic group of order 20 has a single generator, say g, such that all elements can be written as powers of g. If G is isomorphic to C20, then there must exist an element in G with order 20. However, the maximum order of any element in G is lcm(4, 5) = 20, which is achieved by the product of elements of orders 4 and 5. In our case, the element ab has order 20. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C20.\n\nb) D10: The dihedral group D10 has order 20 and consists of symmetries of a regular decagon. It has a cyclic subgroup of order 10 generated by a rotation, say r, and an element of order 2, say s, representing a reflection. The relations between r and s are r^10 = s^2 = e and sr = r^9s. If G is isomorphic to D10, then there must exist elements in G satisfying these relations. In our case, we can take a^2 as r and b as s. Then, (a^2)^10 = a^20 = e, b^2 = e, and (a^2b)(a^2) = a^2ba^4 = a^6b = (a^8)(a^2b). Therefore, G is isomorphic to D10.\n\nc) Non-abelian group of order 20: If G is a non-abelian group of order 20, then it cannot be isomorphic to C20 or D10, as both of these groups are abelian. In this case, G must have a non-abelian Sylow 2-subgroup. However, all Sylow 2-subgroups of G are isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is abelian. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 20 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20 or the dihedral group D10. It cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 20."
