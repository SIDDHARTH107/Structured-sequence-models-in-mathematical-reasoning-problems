    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity and including points at infinity, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nThe given curves are $C_1: y = x^2 - x$ and $C_2: y = x^3 - 4x + 2$. To find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\ny = x^2 - x \\\\\ny = x^3 - 4x + 2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe can substitute the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n$$x^2 - x = x^3 - 4x + 2$$\n\nRearrange the equation to get a polynomial equation:\n\n$$x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0$$\n\nThe degree of this polynomial equation is 3, which is the product of the degrees of the two curves (2 for $C_1$ and 1 for $C_2$). Since the curves have no common components, Bezout's theorem tells us that there are 3 distinct intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$."
