    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology groups of the complex variety $X$, we first need to understand the geometry of $X$. Let's analyze the given equations:\n\n1. $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 = 3w^2$: This equation describes a quadric hypersurface in $\\mathbb{C}^4$. Since the coefficients are all positive, this is an ellipsoid.\n\n2. $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$: This equation describes a cone in $\\mathbb{C}^3$.\n\n3. $w^2 = 1$: This equation describes two parallel hyperplanes in $\\mathbb{C}^4$, given by $w = 1$ and $w = -1$.\n\nNow, let's intersect these varieties. The intersection of the ellipsoid and the cone gives a singular variety, which is a double-sheeted hyperboloid. The intersection of this hyperboloid with the hyperplanes $w = 1$ and $w = -1$ gives two disjoint components of $X$. Each component is a copy of the hyperboloid, which is a smooth, non-compact, complex surface.\n\nTo compute the intersection cohomology groups of $X$, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The intersection cohomology groups of a disjoint union of varieties are the direct sum of the intersection cohomology groups of the individual varieties.\n\n2. The intersection cohomology groups of a smooth variety coincide with its ordinary cohomology groups.\n\n3. The cohomology groups of a hyperboloid can be computed using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence or by observing that it is homotopy equivalent to a circle.\n\nUsing these facts, we find that the intersection cohomology groups of $X$ are given by:\n\n$IH^0(X) = H^0(X) = \\mathbb{C}^2$\n\n$IH^1(X) = H^1(X) = \\mathbb{C}^2$\n\n$IH^2(X) = H^2(X) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\n$IH^k(X) = 0$ for $k > 2$."
