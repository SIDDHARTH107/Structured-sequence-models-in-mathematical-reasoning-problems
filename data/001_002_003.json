    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (1, 3) and (4, 8), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\nUsing the given points (1, 3) and (4, 8):\n\nm = (8 - 3) / (4 - 1)\nm = 5 / 3\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the point (1, 3) and the slope 5/3:\n\ny - 3 = (5/3)(x - 1)\n\nTo get the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), we can distribute the 5/3 and simplify:\n\ny - 3 = (5/3)x - (5/3)\ny = (5/3)x - (5/3) + 3\n\nTo add 3 to the constant term, we need to find a common denominator, which is 3:\n\ny = (5/3)x - (5/3) + (9/3)\ny = (5/3)x + (4/3)\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (1, 3) and (4, 8) is:\n\ny = (5/3)x + (4/3)"
