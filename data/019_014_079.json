    "message_2": "The statement is false. We can provide a counterexample by finding two functions f and g such that for all natural numbers x, f(x) + g(x) is not a prime number.\n\nLet f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 2. Then, for any natural number x, we have:\n\nf(x) + g(x) = 2x + 2 = 2(x + 1)\n\nSince x is a natural number, x + 1 is also a natural number. Thus, 2(x + 1) is a multiple of 2, which means it is an even number. Since all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime, f(x) + g(x) is not a prime number for any natural number x.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false, as we have provided a counterexample with functions f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 2."
