    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphism class of the group, we will use the Sylow Theorems and the information given.\n\n1. The order of the group is 72, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2.\n2. The group is not cyclic, so it cannot be isomorphic to Z_72.\n3. The Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal.\n\nLet's analyze the Sylow subgroups:\n\nSylow 2-subgroups:\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. Since the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal, n_2 cannot be 1, so n_2 = 9.\n\nSylow 3-subgroups:\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. We don't have enough information to determine the value of n_3 yet, so we will consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3. Since n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, say P_2_1, P_2_2, ..., P_2_9. Let P_2_i and P_2_j be two distinct Sylow 2-subgroups. Then, |P_2_i ∩ P_2_j| = 1, because their intersection can only be the identity element. \n\nNow, consider the set P_2_1 * P_3, which is the set of all products of elements from P_2_1 and P_3. Since |P_2_1| = 8 and |P_3| = 9, we have |P_2_1 * P_3| = 72, and P_2_1 * P_3 = G. Thus, G is a semidirect product of P_2_1 and P_3. Since P_3 is normal, we can write G as a semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_8. The possible isomorphism classes in this case are Z_9 ⋊ Z_8 or Z_9 ⋊ (Z_4 × Z_2).\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal. The group G cannot be a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups in this case.\n\nConclusion:\nSince we have exhausted all possibilities, the isomorphism class of the group G must be one of the following: Z_9 ⋊ Z_8 or Z_9 ⋊ (Z_4 × Z_2)."
