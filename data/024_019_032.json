    "message_2": "To calculate the total Gaussian curvature of the surface, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature at any point on the sphere. For a sphere of radius R, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nIn this case, the radius R is 3 cm, so the Gaussian curvature K is:\n\nK = 1/(3^2) = 1/9 cm^(-2)\n\nNow, to verify the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we need to calculate the total Gaussian curvature by integrating the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface of the sphere. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total Gaussian curvature is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface. For a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2.\n\nThe total Gaussian curvature (TG) can be calculated as follows:\n\nTG = ∫∫K dA\n\nSince K is constant over the surface of the sphere, we can rewrite this as:\n\nTG = K * ∫∫dA\n\nThe surface area (A) of a sphere is given by:\n\nA = 4πR^2\n\nSo, the total Gaussian curvature is:\n\nTG = K * A = (1/9) * 4π(3^2) = (4π/9) * 9π = 4π\n\nNow, let's verify the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The theorem states that:\n\nTG = 2πχ\n\nFor a sphere, χ = 2, so:\n\nTG = 2π(2) = 4π\n\nThe total Gaussian curvature we calculated (4π) is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic of the sphere, which verifies the Gauss-Bonnet theorem."
