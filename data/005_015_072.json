    "message_2": "To perform cluster analysis, we can use the k-means clustering algorithm. Since we want a maximum of 3 clusters, we will set k=3. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the centroids randomly by selecting k data points.\n2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n3. Update the centroids by calculating the mean of all the data points assigned to each centroid.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a certain number of iterations have been reached.\n\nApplying the k-means clustering algorithm to the given data:\n\nInitial Centroids (randomly selected):\nC1: (65, 92)\nC2: (54, 86)\nC3: (72, 95)\n\nAfter the first iteration:\nC1: (67, 91.5)\nC2: (54, 82)\nC3: (75.6667, 93.6667)\n\nAfter the second iteration:\nC1: (66, 90)\nC2: (54, 82)\nC3: (75.6667, 93.6667)\n\nThe centroids do not change significantly after the second iteration, so we can stop here.\n\nAssigning the students to the nearest centroid, we get the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1 (C1: (66, 90)):\n- Student 1: (65, 92)\n- Student 4: (68, 87)\n- Student 7: (63, 85)\n- Student 10: (69, 91)\n\nCluster 2 (C2: (54, 82)):\n- Student 2: (54, 86)\n- Student 6: (50, 78)\n- Student 8: (58, 80)\n\nCluster 3 (C3: (75.6667, 93.6667)):\n- Student 3: (72, 95)\n- Student 5: (75, 90)\n- Student 9: (80, 96)\n\nSo, the students are grouped into 3 clusters based on their Maths and Science scores."
