    "message_1": "Suppose there is a hyperbolic hexagon with interior angles measuring 120 degrees each. What is the sum of its interior angles?",
    "message_2": "A hyperbolic hexagon has 6 interior angles. Since each interior angle measures 120 degrees, the sum of its interior angles can be calculated as follows:\n\nSum of interior angles = Number of angles × Measure of each angle\nSum of interior angles = 6 × 120 degrees\nSum of interior angles = 720 degrees\n\nSo, the sum of the interior angles of the hyperbolic hexagon is 720 degrees."
