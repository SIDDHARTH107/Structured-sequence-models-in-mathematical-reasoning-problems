    "message_1": "Let's say we have an elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 11x + 13 over the finite field of integers modulo 17, denoted as GF(17). Suppose we have a base point on the curve P = (5,1) and we want to calculate 6P, i.e., adding P to itself six times on the curve. What is the resulting point?",
    "message_2": "To calculate 6P, we will perform point addition and point doubling operations on the elliptic curve. We will use the following formulas for point addition (P + Q = R) and point doubling (2P = R):\n\nFor point addition:\n1. λ = (y_Q - y_P) * (x_Q - x_P)^(-1) mod 17\n2. x_R = λ^2 - x_P - x_Q mod 17\n3. y_R = λ(x_P - x_R) - y_P mod 17\n\nFor point doubling:\n1. λ = (3x_P^2 + a) * (2y_P)^(-1) mod 17, where a is the coefficient of x in the elliptic curve equation (in this case, a = 11)\n2. x_R = λ^2 - 2x_P mod 17\n3. y_R = λ(x_P - x_R) - y_P mod 17\n\nNow, let's calculate 6P step by step:\n\n1. Calculate 2P:\nP = (5, 1)\nλ = (3*5^2 + 11) * (2*1)^(-1) mod 17 = (3*25 + 11) * 2^(-1) mod 17 = (75 + 11) * 9 mod 17 = 86 * 9 mod 17 = 774 mod 17 = 4\nx_R = 4^2 - 2*5 mod 17 = 16 - 10 mod 17 = 6 mod 17 = 6\ny_R = 4(5 - 6) - 1 mod 17 = 4(-1) - 1 mod 17 = -5 mod 17 = 12\n2P = (6, 12)\n\n2. Calculate 3P = P + 2P:\nP = (5, 1), Q = (6, 12)\nλ = (12 - 1) * (6 - 5)^(-1) mod 17 = 11 * 1 mod 17 = 11\nx_R = 11^2 - 5 - 6 mod 17 = 121 - 11 mod 17 = 110 mod 17 = 2\ny_R = 11(5 - 2) - 1 mod 17 = 11(3) - 1 mod 17 = 33 - 1 mod 17 = 32 mod 17 = 15\n3P = (2, 15)\n\n3. Calculate 6P = 2(3P):\nP = (2, 15)\nλ = (3*2^2 + 11) * (2*15)^(-1) mod 17 = (3*4 + 11) * 30^(-1) mod 17 = (12 + 11) * 13 mod 17 = 23 * 13 mod 17 = 299 mod 17 = 1\nx_R = 1^2 - 2*2 mod 17 = 1 - 4 mod 17 = -3 mod 17 = 14\ny_R = 1(2 - 14) - 15 mod 17 = 1(-12) - 15 mod 17 = -27 mod 17 = 7\n6P = (14, 7)\n\nSo, the resulting point after adding P to itself six times on the curve is 6P = (14, 7)."
