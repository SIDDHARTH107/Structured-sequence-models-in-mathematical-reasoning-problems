    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin²(x) + cos(x) = 1, we can use the Pythagorean identity: sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1. \n\nSince sin²(x) + cos(x) = 1, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nsin²(x) + cos(x) - cos²(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the equation using the difference of squares:\n\n(sin(x) - cos(x))(sin(x) + cos(x)) = 0\n\nNow, we have two separate equations to solve:\n\n1) sin(x) - cos(x) = 0\n2) sin(x) + cos(x) = 0\n\nFor equation 1:\n\nsin(x) = cos(x)\n\nWe know that sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x), so:\n\ncos(π/2 - x) = cos(x)\n\nThis implies that x = π/4 or x = 5π/4.\n\nFor equation 2:\n\nsin(x) = -cos(x)\n\nWe know that sin(x) = -cos(π/2 - x), so:\n\n-cos(π/2 - x) = cos(x)\n\nThis implies that x = 3π/4 or x = 7π/4.\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are:\n\nx = π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, and 7π/4."
