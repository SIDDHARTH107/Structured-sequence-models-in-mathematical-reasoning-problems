    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n| 1  1  1 |  6 |\n| 2 -1  3 | -5 |\n| 3 -1  4 |  3 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows:\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n| 1  1   1 |  6  |\n| 0 -3   1 | -17 |\n| 0 -4   1 | -15 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the y terms in the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 - 4/3 * R2\n\n| 1  1    1 |  6  |\n| 0 -3    1 | -17 |\n| 0  0  -1/3|  1  |\n\nStep 3: Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nNow that we have an upper triangular matrix, we can perform back substitution:\n\nz = -3*(-1/3) = 1\ny = (-17 - z)/(-3) = (-17 - 1)/(-3) = 6\nx = 6 - y - z = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1, y = 6, and z = 1."
