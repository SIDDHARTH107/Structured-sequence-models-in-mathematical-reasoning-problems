    "message_2": "To evaluate the Cauchy integral of $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$ over the rectangular contour $C$, we will break the contour into four line segments and compute the integral over each segment.\n\nLet $C_1$ be the line segment from $(-1, -1)$ to $(-1, 1)$, $C_2$ be the line segment from $(-1, 1)$ to $(1, 1)$, $C_3$ be the line segment from $(1, 1)$ to $(1, -1)$, and $C_4$ be the line segment from $(1, -1)$ to $(-1, -1)$.\n\n1. For $C_1$, we have $z = -1 + yi$ with $y$ going from $-1$ to $1$. Thus, $dz = i dy$. The integral over $C_1$ is:\n\n$$\\int_{C_1} \\frac{1}{z} dz = \\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{1}{-1 + yi} (i dy) = i \\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{i}{-1 + yi} dy$$\n\n2. For $C_2$, we have $z = x + i$ with $x$ going from $-1$ to $1$. Thus, $dz = dx$. The integral over $C_2$ is:\n\n$$\\int_{C_2} \\frac{1}{z} dz = \\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{1}{x + i} dx$$\n\n3. For $C_3$, we have $z = 1 + yi$ with $y$ going from $1$ to $-1$. Thus, $dz = -i dy$. The integral over $C_3$ is:\n\n$$\\int_{C_3} \\frac{1}{z} dz = \\int_{1}^{-1} \\frac{1}{1 + yi} (-i dy) = -i \\int_{1}^{-1} \\frac{i}{1 + yi} dy$$\n\n4. For $C_4$, we have $z = x - i$ with $x$ going from $1$ to $-1$. Thus, $dz = -dx$. The integral over $C_4$ is:\n\n$$\\int_{C_4} \\frac{1}{z} dz = \\int_{1}^{-1} \\frac{1}{x - i} (-dx) = \\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{1}{x - i} dx$$\n\nNow, we sum the integrals over the four segments:\n\n$$\\int_C \\frac{1}{z} dz = \\int_{C_1} \\frac{1}{z} dz + \\int_{C_2} \\frac{1}{z} dz + \\int_{C_3} \\frac{1}{z} dz + \\int_{C_4} \\frac{1}{z} dz$$\n\nNotice that the integrals over $C_2$ and $C_4$ are conjugates of each other, and the integrals over $C_1$ and $C_3$ are also conjugates of each other. Thus, their sum is real:\n\n$$\\int_C \\frac{1}{z} dz = 2 \\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{1}{x + i} dx + 2i \\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{i}{-1 + yi} dy$$\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy integral theorem, which states that if a function is analytic in a simply connected domain, then the integral of the function over any closed contour in that domain is zero. Since $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$ is analytic everywhere except at $z = 0$, and the contour $C$ encloses the point $z = 0$, the Cauchy integral theorem does not apply directly. However, we can use a keyhole contour to avoid the singularity at $z = 0$ and apply the Cauchy integral theorem.\n\nIn this case, the integral of $f(z)$ over the rectangular contour $C$ is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the winding number of the contour around the singularity. Since the winding number of the rectangular contour $C$ around the origin is 1, we have:\n\n$$\\int_C \\frac{1}{z} dz = 2\\pi i$$"
