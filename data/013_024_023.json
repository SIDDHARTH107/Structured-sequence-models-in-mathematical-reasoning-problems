    "message_1": "In a group of 6 volunteers, each volunteer is given the choice to either contribute $10 or not contribute at all towards a charity fundraiser event. If at least 4 of the 6 volunteers contribute, the charity fundraiser event will be successful and will raise $240 to donate to the charity. However, if less than 4 volunteers contribute, the fundraiser will not be successful and no money will be raised. What is the probability that the fundraiser event will be successful?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the fundraiser event being successful, we need to find the probability of at least 4 volunteers contributing. There are two possible outcomes for each volunteer: contribute or not contribute. So, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of contributions from the 6 volunteers.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of combinations where at least 4 volunteers contribute. This can happen in three ways: 4 volunteers contribute, 5 volunteers contribute, or all 6 volunteers contribute.\n\n1. 4 volunteers contribute: There are 6 choose 4 (6C4) ways to select 4 volunteers out of 6, which is 15.\n\n2. 5 volunteers contribute: There are 6 choose 5 (6C5) ways to select 5 volunteers out of 6, which is 6.\n\n3. All 6 volunteers contribute: There is only 1 way for this to happen (all of them contribute).\n\nSo, there are a total of 15 + 6 + 1 = 22 successful combinations.\n\nThe probability of the fundraiser event being successful is the ratio of successful combinations to the total number of combinations:\n\nP(successful) = (number of successful combinations) / (total number of combinations) = 22 / 64 = 11 / 32\n\nTherefore, the probability of the fundraiser event being successful is 11/32 or approximately 34.375%."
