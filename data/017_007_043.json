    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will first show that if G has an element of order 6, then it is isomorphic to C6. If not, we will show that G must be non-abelian and isomorphic to D3.\n\n1. G has an element of order 6:\n\nIf G has an element of order 6, let's call it a, then G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is cyclic and isomorphic to C6, since every element in G can be expressed as a power of a.\n\n2. G does not have an element of order 6:\n\nIf G does not have an element of order 6, then by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 3. Since G has order 6, there must be at least one element of order 3, let's call it b. Then, G contains the subgroup H = {e, b, b^2} of order 3.\n\nNow, let's consider an element a in G that is not in H. Since the order of a cannot be 1 or 3 (otherwise, a would be in H), the order of a must be 2. Note that the order of ab must be 6, as otherwise, ab would have order 1, 2, or 3, which would imply that ab is in H or ab = a, both of which are contradictions.\n\nNow, let's consider the product (ab)^2. We have:\n\n(ab)^2 = abab\n\nSince a has order 2, we know that a^2 = e. Therefore, we can insert an \"a^2\" between the two middle terms without changing the expression:\n\n(ab)^2 = a(ba^2)b = aba^2b\n\nNow, we want to show that G is non-abelian. If G were abelian, then ab = ba, and we would have:\n\n(ab)^2 = abab = a^2b^2 = e * (b^2) = b^2\n\nThis would imply that (ab)^2 has order 1, 2, or 3, which contradicts our earlier statement that the order of ab must be 6. Therefore, G must be non-abelian.\n\nSince G is non-abelian and has an element of order 2 (a) and an element of order 3 (b), it is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3. The elements of D3 can be represented as {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}, where r has order 3 and s has order 2. The isomorphism can be defined as follows:\n\nϕ: G → D3\nϕ(e) = e\nϕ(a) = s\nϕ(b) = r\nϕ(a^2) = s^2\nϕ(b^2) = r^2\nϕ(ab) = sr\n\nThis mapping preserves the group operation and is bijective, so G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 6, it is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3. If G is non-abelian, then it is isomorphic to D3."
