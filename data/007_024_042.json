    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm of 3 (base 7) mod 17, we need to find an integer x such that:\n\n7^x ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n\nWe can start by calculating powers of 7 modulo 17:\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n7^2 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n7^3 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n7^4 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n7^5 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n7^6 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n7^7 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nWe can see that none of these powers are congruent to 3 modulo 17. However, we can continue by multiplying the last result by 7:\n\n7^8 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n7^9 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n7^10 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n7^11 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n7^12 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n7^13 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n7^14 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nAgain, none of these powers are congruent to 3 modulo 17. We can continue this process:\n\n7^15 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n7^16 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n7^17 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n7^18 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n7^19 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n7^20 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n7^21 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nOnce again, none of these powers are congruent to 3 modulo 17. However, we notice a pattern: the powers of 7 modulo 17 repeat every 6 powers. This is because 7 has order 6 modulo 17. Since we have not found a power of 7 congruent to 3 modulo 17, we can conclude that there is no discrete logarithm of 3 (base 7) mod 17."
