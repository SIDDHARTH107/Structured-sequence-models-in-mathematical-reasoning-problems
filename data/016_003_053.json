    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a complex and intricate fractal, and determining the exact number of connected components with a specific diameter range is not a straightforward task. However, it is known that the main cardioid and the main circle of the Mandelbrot set are the largest connected components, and their diameters are greater than 0.2. \n\nMost of the smaller connected components are found as satellite components around the main cardioid and circle, and they are often referred to as \"islands\" or \"mini-Mandelbrots.\" These smaller components typically have diameters less than 0.1. \n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to assume that there are very few, if any, connected components in the Mandelbrot set with a diameter between 0.1 and 0.2. To determine the exact number, one would need to perform a detailed analysis of the Mandelbrot set, which is beyond the scope of this response."
