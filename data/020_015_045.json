    "message_1": "A rectangular field is to be enclosed by a fence on three sides, using a river bank as the fourth side. If 500 meters of fence material is available, find the maximum possible area of the field that can be enclosed.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the field along the river bank be x meters, and the width of the field perpendicular to the river bank be y meters. Since the fence material is used for the other three sides, we have:\n\nx + 2y = 500\n\nWe want to maximize the area A of the field, which is given by:\n\nA = xy\n\nWe can solve for x in terms of y (or vice versa) from the first equation:\n\nx = 500 - 2y\n\nNow substitute this expression for x into the area equation:\n\nA = (500 - 2y)y\nA = 500y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dy = 500 - 4y = 0\n\nSolving for y:\n\n4y = 500\ny = 125\n\nNow substitute this value of y back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 500 - 2(125)\nx = 500 - 250\nx = 250\n\nSo the dimensions of the field that give the maximum area are x = 250 meters and y = 125 meters. The maximum area of the field is:\n\nA = xy\nA = 250 * 125\nA = 31,250 square meters"
