    "message_2": "To solve this optimal control problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we define the Hamiltonian function H as follows:\n\nH(x, u, p, t) = (u^2(t)) + (x(t) - 1)^2 + p(t)(u(t) - x(t))\n\nwhere p(t) is the costate variable.\n\nAccording to Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control u(t) should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. ∂H/∂u = 0\n2. dp/dt = -∂H/∂x\n\nNow, we will find the partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian function:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u(t) + p(t)\n∂H/∂x = 2(x(t) - 1) - p(t)\n\nFrom condition 1, we have:\n\n2u(t) + p(t) = 0\nu(t) = -1/2 * p(t)\n\nNow, we will find the time derivative of the costate variable p(t) using condition 2:\n\ndp/dt = -∂H/∂x = -2(x(t) - 1) + p(t)\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for u(t) from the state equation:\n\ndx/dt = u(t) - x(t) = -1/2 * p(t) - x(t)\n\nWe have a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -1/2 * p(t) - x(t)\ndp/dt = -2(x(t) - 1) + p(t)\n\nwith the initial conditions x(0) = 0 and p(1) = 0 (since the problem is fixed at the final time).\n\nSolving this system of differential equations, we get:\n\nx(t) = 1 - (3/2)e^(-t) + (1/2)e^(-2t)\np(t) = 2e^(-t) - 2e^(-2t)\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for p(t) into the expression for u(t):\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * p(t) = -1/2 * (2e^(-t) - 2e^(-2t))\n\nThus, the optimal control u(t) that minimizes J is:\n\nu(t) = -e^(-t) + e^(-2t)"
