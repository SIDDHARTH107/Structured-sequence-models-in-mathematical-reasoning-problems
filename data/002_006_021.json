    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter (d)\n\nIn this case, the diameter (d) is 12 cm. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π * 12 cm\n\nUsing the approximate value of π as 3.14:\n\nC = 3.14 * 12 cm\nC = 37.68 cm\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 37.68 cm."
