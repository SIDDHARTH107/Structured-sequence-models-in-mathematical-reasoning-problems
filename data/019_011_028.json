    "message_1": "Here's a problem for you to solve as a math student on Relevance logic:\n\nLet p be the statement \"It is raining\" and q be the statement \"The ground is wet.\" Let R(p, q) be the relevance relation such that R(p, q) is true when it is raining and the ground is wet, and false otherwise. \n\nIf p is true and q is false, what is the truth value of R(p, q)?",
    "message_2": "Given that p is true (it is raining) and q is false (the ground is not wet), we can evaluate the truth value of R(p, q).\n\nSince R(p, q) is true only when both p and q are true (it is raining and the ground is wet), and in this case q is false, the truth value of R(p, q) is false."
