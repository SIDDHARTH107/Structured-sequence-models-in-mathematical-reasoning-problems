    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 7 cm. Find the surface area of the rectangular prism.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length × width): 10 cm × 5 cm = 50 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 50 cm² = 100 cm².\n\n2. The area of another pair of opposite faces (length × height): 10 cm × 7 cm = 70 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 70 cm² = 140 cm².\n\n3. The area of the last pair of opposite faces (width × height): 5 cm × 7 cm = 35 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 35 cm² = 70 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together: 100 cm² + 140 cm² + 70 cm² = 310 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 310 cm²."
