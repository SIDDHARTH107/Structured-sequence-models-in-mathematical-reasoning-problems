    "message_1": "A group of five students (A, B, C, D, E) took a logic exam, and the teacher said that at least one of them passed. If each student knows whether they passed or not, and A knows that B didn't pass, but doesn't know if C passed, and D knows that E didn't pass, what is the highest number of students that could have passed?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the information given:\n\n1. At least one student passed.\n2. A knows B didn't pass.\n3. A doesn't know if C passed.\n4. D knows E didn't pass.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that B didn't pass. From point 4, we know that E didn't pass. Now, let's consider point 3. If A doesn't know whether C passed or not, it means that A must have passed. If A didn't pass, then A would know that C must have passed since at least one student passed. So, A passed.\n\nNow we have:\nA - Passed\nB - Didn't pass\nC - Unknown\nD - Unknown\nE - Didn't pass\n\nSince there is no information given about D, it is possible that D passed. Therefore, the highest number of students that could have passed is 3 (A, C, and D)."
