    "message_1": "What are the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120 that exist apart from the cyclic group C120 and the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 mod p and divides n.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Therefore, we need to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- There is one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 (2^3). This is the case for the cyclic group C120 and the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2.\n- There are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 (2^3). This is the case for the symmetric group S5.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- There is one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3 (3^1). This is the case for the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, and the symmetric group S5.\n\nFor Sylow 5-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- There is one Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5 (5^1). This is the case for the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, and the symmetric group S5.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\nWe have already found three such groups: the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, and the symmetric group S5. However, we are asked to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120 apart from the cyclic group C120 and the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1, which is the symmetric group S5."
