    "message_2": "The given equation is an elliptic curve, and we want to find its minimal model over the field of rational numbers. An elliptic curve is said to be in minimal Weierstrass form if its equation is of the form:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are integers such that the discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$ is non-zero and has minimal absolute value among all the equivalent curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe given equation is already in Weierstrass form:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - 6x + 6$\n\nHere, $A = -6$ and $B = 6$. Let's compute the discriminant:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4(-6)^3 + 27(6)^2) = -16(-864 + 972) = -16(108) = -1728$\n\nSince the discriminant is non-zero, the curve is non-singular. Now we need to check if it is minimal. A curve is minimal if the valuation of the discriminant with respect to any prime $p$ is not divisible by $12$. In our case, the only prime dividing the discriminant is $3$, and the valuation of the discriminant with respect to $3$ is $3$, which is not divisible by $12$. Therefore, the given curve is already minimal.\n\nSo, the minimal model of the algebraic variety over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ is:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - 6x + 6$"
