    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of sets A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\nSince there are no common elements in sets A and B, their intersection is an empty set:\nA ∩ B = ∅\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A ∩ B:\n\n(A ∩ B) x (A ∩ B) = ∅ x ∅ = ∅\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products of A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A x B) and (B x A):\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = ∅ (since there are no common ordered pairs in A x B and B x A)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n(A ∩ B) x (A ∩ B) = ∅\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = ∅\n\nSince both results are equal, the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection in this case. However, this is not a general proof, and it's important to note that the distributive property does not hold for all cases of Cartesian products and intersections."
