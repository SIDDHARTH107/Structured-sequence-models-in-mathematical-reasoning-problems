    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In this case, the graph is a simple linear graph with vertices A, B, C, D, and E connected in a straight line.\n\nThe longest shortest path is between vertices A and E, which is:\n\nA - B - C - D - E\n\nThis path has a length of 4, so the diameter of the graph is 4."
