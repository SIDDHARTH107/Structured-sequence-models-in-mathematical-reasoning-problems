    "message_1": "Suppose a bottle manufacturing company wants to test the quality of its bottles. The company samples 100 bottles and inspects them for defects. Out of the 100 bottles, 12 are found to be defective. Find the proportion of defective bottles in the entire batch assuming that the batch size is 10,000 bottles.",
    "message_2": "To find the proportion of defective bottles in the entire batch, we can use the information from the sample to estimate the proportion for the whole batch.\n\nIn the sample of 100 bottles, 12 were found to be defective. So, the proportion of defective bottles in the sample is:\n\n12 defective bottles / 100 total bottles = 0.12\n\nNow, we can assume that this proportion is representative of the entire batch of 10,000 bottles. To estimate the number of defective bottles in the entire batch, we can multiply the proportion by the total number of bottles:\n\n0.12 * 10,000 bottles = 1,200 defective bottles\n\nSo, we can estimate that there are 1,200 defective bottles in the entire batch of 10,000 bottles. The proportion of defective bottles in the entire batch is:\n\n1,200 defective bottles / 10,000 total bottles = 0.12 or 12%\n\nTherefore, the proportion of defective bottles in the entire batch is approximately 12%."
