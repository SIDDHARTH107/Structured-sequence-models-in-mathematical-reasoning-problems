    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. \n\nDiameter of the sphere = Edge length of the cube = 12 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius of the sphere = Diameter / 2 = 12 cm / 2 = 6 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * (6 cm)^3\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * 216 cm^3\nVolume of the sphere ≈ 288π cm^3\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14:\n\nVolume of the sphere ≈ 288 * 3.14 cm^3\nVolume of the sphere ≈ 904.32 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 904.32 cubic centimeters."
