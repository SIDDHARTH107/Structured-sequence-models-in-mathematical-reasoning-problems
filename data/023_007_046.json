    "message_1": "A signal g(t) has Fourier transform G(f) = 2/(1+j2πf). What is the value of g(0)?",
    "message_2": "To find the value of g(0), we need to use the inverse Fourier transform formula:\n\ng(t) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[G(f) * e^(j2πft) df]\n\nSince we want to find g(0), we can plug in t = 0:\n\ng(0) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[G(f) * e^(j2πf*0) df] = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[G(f) df]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given Fourier transform G(f) = 2 / (1 + j2πf):\n\ng(0) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[(2 / (1 + j2πf)) df]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the residue theorem from complex analysis. The integrand has a simple pole at f = -1/(2πj). The residue at this pole is:\n\nResidue = lim_(f -> -1/(2πj)) [(f + 1/(2πj)) * (2 / (1 + j2πf))]\n\nResidue = 2 * (2πj)\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the integral:\n\ng(0) = (1 / (2π)) * 2π * Residue = 2 * (2πj)\n\ng(0) = 4πj\n\nHowever, g(t) should be a real-valued function, so the imaginary part should be zero. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or the Fourier transform G(f). Please double-check the problem statement and the given Fourier transform."
