The company can produce the product at two different factories, A and B. Factory A can produce 100 units per day with a production cost of $10 per unit, while factory B can produce 150 units per day with a production cost of $12 per unit. The demand for the product follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 units per day and a standard deviation of 50 units per day. \n\nThe company wants to minimize its total production cost over the next 7 days, while ensuring that the daily demand for the product is met with a probability of at least 95%. What is the optimal production plan for the company? \n\nAssume that any unsold units cannot be carried over to the next day and the company has to decide on its production plan at the start of each day.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal production plan that minimizes the total production cost while meeting the daily demand with a probability of at least 95%. Since the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 units and a standard deviation of 50 units, we can use the z-score to find the demand level that corresponds to a 95% probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the z-score corresponding to a 95% probability is 1.645. Now, we can calculate the demand level at this probability:\n\nDemand = Mean + (z-score * Standard Deviation)\nDemand = 600 + (1.645 * 50)\nDemand ≈ 682.25\n\nTo be safe, we can round up to 683 units to ensure that we meet the daily demand with a probability of at least 95%.\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal production plan that minimizes the total production cost. We can produce the product at two different factories, A and B. Factory A can produce 100 units per day with a production cost of $10 per unit, while factory B can produce 150 units per day with a production cost of $12 per unit.\n\nLet x be the number of units produced at factory A and y be the number of units produced at factory B. We need to minimize the total production cost, which can be represented as:\n\nCost = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx + y ≥ 683 (to meet the demand)\nx ≤ 100 (maximum production capacity of factory A)\ny ≤ 150 (maximum production capacity of factory B)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we should produce as many units as possible at the cheaper factory A. Since factory A can produce a maximum of 100 units per day, we can set x = 100. Now, we need to find the value of y:\n\n100 + y ≥ 683\ny ≥ 583\n\nSince factory B can produce a maximum of 150 units per day, we cannot produce all the remaining units at factory B. In this case, the company should produce at full capacity in both factories. So, x = 100 and y = 150.\n\nThe optimal production plan for the company is to produce 100 units per day at factory A and 150 units per day at factory B. The total daily production cost will be:\n\nCost = 10(100) + 12(150)\nCost = 1000 + 1800\nCost = $2800\n\nOver the next 7 days, the total production cost will be:\n\nTotal Cost = 7 * 2800\nTotal Cost = $19,600"
