    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers, we can apply Sylow's Theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G. By Sylow's First Theorem, there exists a subgroup of G of order 5 and a subgroup of G of order 7.\n\nLet n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and n_7 be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups. By Sylow's Third Theorem, we have:\n\nn_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5) and n_5 | 7\nn_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7) and n_7 | 5\n\nThe only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, and the only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5. Since n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5), we must have n_5 = 1. Similarly, since n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we must have n_7 = 1.\n\nNow, let P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G and Q be the unique Sylow 7-subgroup of G. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal subgroups of G (by Sylow's Second Theorem). We have:\n\n|P| = 5 and |Q| = 7\n\nSince 5 and 7 are prime numbers, P and Q are cyclic groups (generated by elements of order 5 and 7, respectively).\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are normal subgroups of G, we can consider their product PQ, which is a subgroup of G. We have:\n\n|PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q|\n\nSince P and Q have prime orders, their intersection can either be trivial (i.e., containing only the identity element) or equal to one of the subgroups. If P ∩ Q = P or P ∩ Q = Q, then one subgroup would be contained in the other, which is not possible since their orders are distinct prime numbers. Therefore, P ∩ Q must be trivial, containing only the identity element. So, we have:\n\n|PQ| = |P| * |Q| / 1 = 5 * 7 = 35\n\nSince |PQ| = |G|, we have PQ = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7. In conclusion, G is either cyclic (if there exists an element of order 35) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
