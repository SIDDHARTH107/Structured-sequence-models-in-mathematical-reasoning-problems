    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg duopoly game where the demand function is P = 100 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the quantity. Firm 1 (the leader) has a constant marginal cost of $20, while firm 2 (the follower) has a constant marginal cost of $40. Determine the profit-maximizing quantity and price for both firms in the Stackelberg equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction function for firm 2 (the follower). The reaction function shows the optimal quantity firm 2 will produce given the quantity produced by firm 1.\n\nLet q1 be the quantity produced by firm 1 and q2 be the quantity produced by firm 2. The total quantity Q is the sum of q1 and q2: Q = q1 + q2. The price function can be rewritten as P = 100 - (q1 + q2).\n\nFirm 2's profit function is given by:\nπ2 = (P - MC2) * q2\nπ2 = ((100 - (q1 + q2)) - 40) * q2\nπ2 = (60 - q1 - q2) * q2\n\nTo find the reaction function, we need to maximize firm 2's profit with respect to q2. To do this, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q2 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ2/dq2 = 60 - q1 - 2q2 = 0\n\nSolving for q2, we get the reaction function for firm 2:\nq2 = (60 - q1) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the profit-maximizing quantity for firm 1 (the leader). Firm 1's profit function is given by:\nπ1 = (P - MC1) * q1\nπ1 = ((100 - (q1 + q2)) - 20) * q1\nπ1 = (80 - q1 - q2) * q1\n\nSince firm 1 knows firm 2's reaction function, it can substitute q2 = (60 - q1) / 2 into its profit function:\nπ1 = (80 - q1 - (60 - q1) / 2) * q1\n\nSimplifying the profit function:\nπ1 = (100 - (3/2)q1) * q1\n\nTo maximize firm 1's profit, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ1/dq1 = 100 - 3q1 = 0\n\nSolving for q1, we get the profit-maximizing quantity for firm 1:\nq1 = 100 / 3 ≈ 33.33\n\nNow, we can find the profit-maximizing quantity for firm 2 by plugging q1 into its reaction function:\nq2 = (60 - 100 / 3) / 2 ≈ 13.33\n\nFinally, we can find the equilibrium price by plugging q1 and q2 into the price function:\nP = 100 - (33.33 + 13.33) = 100 - 46.66 ≈ 53.34\n\nIn the Stackelberg equilibrium, firm 1 (the leader) will produce a quantity of approximately 33.33 units, firm 2 (the follower) will produce a quantity of approximately 13.33 units, and the equilibrium price will be approximately $53.34."
