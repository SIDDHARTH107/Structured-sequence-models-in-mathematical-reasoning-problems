Then, find the solutions of the Hamiltonian system $\\dot{x} = X_H(x)$ starting at the point $(1,0,1,0)$ and sketch the phase portrait.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$, we need to find a vector field such that $i_{X_H}\\omega = -dH$. Let's first compute the exterior derivative of the Hamiltonian function:\n\n$$\ndH = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} dy + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z} dz + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} dt = 2x dx + 2y dy + 2z dz + 2t dt.\n$$\n\nNow, let's assume that the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ has components $(A, B, C, D)$. Then, we have:\n\n$$\ni_{X_H}\\omega = A(dx \\wedge dy + dz \\wedge dt) + B(dy \\wedge dx + dt \\wedge dz) + C(dz \\wedge dt + dx \\wedge dy) + D(dt \\wedge dz + dy \\wedge dx).\n$$\n\nUsing the properties of the wedge product, we can simplify this expression:\n\n$$\ni_{X_H}\\omega = (A - C) dx \\wedge dy + (B - D) dy \\wedge dx + (A - D) dz \\wedge dt + (B - C) dt \\wedge dz.\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the components $(A, B, C, D)$ such that $i_{X_H}\\omega = -dH$. Comparing the coefficients of the basis elements, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nA - C = 0 \\\\\nB - D = 0 \\\\\nA - D = -2y \\\\\nB - C = 2x\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSolving this system, we obtain:\n\n$$\nA = C, \\quad B = D, \\quad A = 2y, \\quad B = -2x.\n$$\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is given by:\n\n$$\nX_H = (2y, -2x, 2y, -2x).\n$$\n\nNow, we need to show that $X_H$ is a symplectic vector field. A vector field is symplectic if the Lie derivative of the symplectic form along the vector field vanishes, i.e., $L_{X_H}\\omega = 0$. Using the Cartan's magic formula, we have:\n\n$$\nL_{X_H}\\omega = i_{X_H}d\\omega + d(i_{X_H}\\omega).\n$$\n\nSince $\\omega$ is a 2-form, $d\\omega = 0$. Therefore, we only need to compute the exterior derivative of $i_{X_H}\\omega$:\n\n$$\nd(i_{X_H}\\omega) = d((2y, -2x, 2y, -2x) \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy + dz \\wedge dt)) = 0.\n$$\n\nThus, $L_{X_H}\\omega = 0$, and $X_H$ is a symplectic vector field.\n\nNow, let's find the solutions of the Hamiltonian system $\\dot{x} = X_H(x)$ starting at the point $(1,0,1,0)$. The system of equations is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x} = 2y \\\\\n\\dot{y} = -2x \\\\\n\\dot{z} = 2t \\\\\n\\dot{t} = -2z\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWith the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$, $y(0) = 0$, $z(0) = 1$, and $t(0) = 0$, we can solve this system of differential equations. The solutions are:\n\n$$\nx(t) = \\cos(2t), \\quad y(t) = -\\sin(2t), \\quad z(t) = \\cosh(2t), \\quad t(t) = \\sinh(2t).\n$$\n\nFinally, to sketch the phase portrait, we can plot the solutions in the $(x, y, z, t)$ space. The phase portrait will show that the solutions are periodic in the $(x, y)$ plane with period $\\pi$ and hyperbolic in the $(z, t)$ plane."
