    "message_2": "To find the number of faces in a triangulation, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 14 and E = 25. Plugging these values into Euler's formula, we get:\n\n14 - 25 + F = 2\n\nSolving for F, we find that there are F = 13 faces in this triangulation."
