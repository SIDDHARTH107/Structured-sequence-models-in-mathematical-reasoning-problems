    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. We will first find the possible Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, by the third Sylow theorem, the number of such subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 3, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, by the third Sylow theorem, the number of such subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Therefore, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4 or 16, there are multiple Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow, we can list the possible non-abelian groups of order 48 based on the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are normal, we have a direct product of the two subgroups. Since there are two possible Sylow 2-subgroups (C_8 and D_8) and one Sylow 3-subgroup (C_3), we have two non-abelian groups: C_8 x C_3 and D_8 x C_3.\n\n2. If the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal and the Sylow 3-subgroup is not normal, we have a semidirect product of the two subgroups. There are two possible Sylow 2-subgroups (C_8 and D_8) and two possible Sylow 3-subgroup configurations (n_3 = 4 or 16). For each combination, there are two possible non-trivial homomorphisms, giving us a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 non-abelian groups.\n\n3. If the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal and the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, we have a semidirect product of the two subgroups. There is one possible Sylow 2-subgroup (Q_16) and one Sylow 3-subgroup (C_3). There are two possible non-trivial homomorphisms, giving us 2 non-abelian groups.\n\n4. If neither Sylow 2-subgroup nor Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, there are no non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn total, we have 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 non-abelian groups of order 48. The 14 mentioned in the question is incorrect. The non-abelian groups are:\n\n1. C_8 x C_3\n2. D_8 x C_3\n3-6. Semidirect products of C_8 and C_3 with non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups\n7-10. Semidirect products of D_8 and C_3 with non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups\n11-12. Semidirect products of Q_16 and C_3 with non-normal Sylow 2-subgroups\n\nThese are all the possible non-abelian groups of order 48, and there are no others."
