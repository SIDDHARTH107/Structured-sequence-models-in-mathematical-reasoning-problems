    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It is constructed through a series of iterations, with each iteration increasing the complexity of the curve.\n\nIn the first iteration, the starting line segment is replaced by 9 smaller line segments, each with a length of 1/3. So, the total length of the curve after the first iteration is 9 * (1/3) = 3.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the 9 smaller line segments from the first iteration is replaced by 9 even smaller line segments, each with a length of 1/9. So, the total length of the curve after the second iteration is 9 * 9 * (1/9) = 9.\n\nIn the third iteration, each of the 81 smaller line segments from the second iteration is replaced by 9 even smaller line segments, each with a length of 1/27. So, the total length of the curve after the third iteration is 9 * 81 * (1/27) = 27.\n\nIn the fourth iteration, each of the 729 smaller line segments from the third iteration is replaced by 9 even smaller line segments, each with a length of 1/81. So, the total length of the curve after the fourth iteration is 9 * 729 * (1/81) = 81.\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve up to the first 4 iterations is 81, assuming the starting line segment has a length of 1."
