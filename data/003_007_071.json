    "message_1": "A ship leaves a harbor and sails 10 kilometers at a bearing of 45 degrees. It then turns and sails 15 kilometers at a bearing of 120 degrees. What is the distance between its starting point and its final position, and at what bearing from the starting point is the final position located?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the law of cosines and some trigonometry.\n\nFirst, let's break down the two legs of the journey into their x and y components:\n\nFor the first leg (10 km at 45 degrees):\nx1 = 10 * cos(45) = 10 * 0.7071 ≈ 7.071 km\ny1 = 10 * sin(45) = 10 * 0.7071 ≈ 7.071 km\n\nFor the second leg (15 km at 120 degrees):\nx2 = 15 * cos(120) = 15 * (-0.5) = -7.5 km\ny2 = 15 * sin(120) = 15 * 0.866 = 12.99 km\n\nNow, let's find the total x and y components of the journey:\nx_total = x1 + x2 = 7.071 - 7.5 = -0.429 km\ny_total = y1 + y2 = 7.071 + 12.99 = 20.061 km\n\nNow we can find the distance between the starting point and the final position using the Pythagorean theorem:\ndistance = sqrt(x_total^2 + y_total^2) = sqrt((-0.429)^2 + (20.061)^2) ≈ 20.07 km\n\nTo find the bearing, we can use the arctangent function:\nbearing = arctan(y_total / x_total) = arctan(20.061 / -0.429)\nSince the x_total is negative, we need to add 180 degrees to the result:\nbearing ≈ arctan(20.061 / -0.429) + 180 ≈ 267.7 degrees\n\nSo, the distance between the starting point and the final position is approximately 20.07 kilometers, and the bearing from the starting point to the final position is approximately 267.7 degrees."
