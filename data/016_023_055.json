    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (the four smaller squares in the corners and the one in the center). The scaling factor (s) is determined by the size of the square used for construction. In this case, the size of the square is 3 units, so the scaling factor is 3.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the size of the square used for construction is 3 units is approximately 1.465."
