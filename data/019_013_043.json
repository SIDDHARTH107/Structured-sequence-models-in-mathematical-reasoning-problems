    "message_2": "The smallest set of axioms required to define the natural numbers in second-order logic is the Peano axioms, which consist of five axioms. These axioms are:\n\n1. Zero is a natural number: ∀P(P(0))\n2. Equality: ∀n(n = n)\n3. Successor function: ∀n∀m(S(n) = S(m) → n = m)\n4. Induction: ∀P(P(0) ∧ ∀n(P(n) → P(S(n))) → ∀n(P(n)))\n5. No zero successor: ∀n(S(n) ≠ 0)\n\nIn second-order logic, the induction axiom is expressed as a second-order quantification over predicates P, which allows for a more expressive and complete characterization of the natural numbers."
