    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nAccording to a medical report, the probability of a person having a certain medical condition is 0.15. A clinic has 100 patients. What is the expected number of patients in the clinic who have this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of patients with the medical condition, we can multiply the probability of having the condition by the total number of patients in the clinic.\n\nExpected number of patients with the condition = Probability of having the condition × Total number of patients\n\nExpected number of patients with the condition = 0.15 × 100\n\nExpected number of patients with the condition = 15\n\nSo, the expected number of patients in the clinic who have this medical condition is 15."
