    "message_1": "A manufacturer has to decide how much of two different products, A and B, to produce each week. \n- Each unit of A requires 2 hours of labor, 1 hour of machine time, and produces a profit of $1000. \n- Each unit of B requires 3 hours of labor, 2 hours of machine time, and produces a profit of $1500.\n- The labor and machine time available each week are 160 hours and 100 hours, respectively.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of A and B that the manufacturer should produce each week to maximize their total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabor: 2x + 3y ≤ 160\nMachine time: x + 2y ≤ 100\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nProfit = 1000x + 1500y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first solve the constraint inequalities to find the feasible region.\n\n1. Solve the labor constraint for y:\n\n3y ≤ 160 - 2x\ny ≤ (160 - 2x)/3\n\n2. Solve the machine time constraint for y:\n\n2y ≤ 100 - x\ny ≤ (100 - x)/2\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region by setting the inequalities as equalities and solving the system of equations.\n\n1.

Profit at (80, 0):\n\nProfit = 1000(80) + 1500(0) = 80000\n\n2. Profit at (20, 40):\n\nProfit = 1000(20) + 1500(40) = 20000 + 60000 = 80000\n\n3. Profit at (0, 50):\n\nProfit = 1000(0) + 1500(50) = 75000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the points (80, 0) and (20, 40), both with a profit of $80,000. The manufacturer can choose to produce either 80 units of product A and 0 units of product B or 20 units of product A and 40 units of product B to achieve the maximum profit of $80,000 per week."
