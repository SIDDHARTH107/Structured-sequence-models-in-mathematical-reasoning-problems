    "message_1": "What is the correlation coefficient between the age and weight of 50 students, if the sample mean age is 18 years with a standard deviation of 2 years and the sample mean weight is 65 kg with a standard deviation of 5 kg?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between age and weight of the 50 students, we need the data points for each student's age and weight. The information provided only gives us the sample mean and standard deviation for age and weight, which is not enough to calculate the correlation coefficient.\n\nIf you can provide the data points for each student's age and weight, we can then calculate the correlation coefficient."
