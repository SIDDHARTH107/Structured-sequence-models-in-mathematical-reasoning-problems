He walks away from the tower along the shore and finds that at a point, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 30 degrees. What is the height of the tower?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. Let's denote the height of the tower as h and the distance the person walked away from the tower along the shore as d. The angle of elevation is 30 degrees.\n\nWe have:\n\ntan(30) = h / (200 + d)\n\nSince we know that tan(30) = 1/sqrt(3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/sqrt(3) = h / (200 + d)\n\nNow we need to find the value of d. We can use the given information that the person walked away from the tower along the shore and found that the angle of elevation was 30 degrees. This means that the person, the top of the tower, and the point on the shore where the person started form a right triangle. The angle between the shore and the line connecting the person to the top of the tower is 30 degrees.\n\nLet's use the sine function to find the value of d:\n\nsin(30) = d / (200 + d)\n\nSince sin(30) = 1/2, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/2 = d / (200 + d)\n\nNow, we can solve for d:\n\nd = (1/2) * (200 + d)\n\n2d = 200 + d\n\nd = 200\n\nNow that we have the value of d, we can find the height of the tower:\n\n1/sqrt(3) = h / (200 + 200)\n\n1/sqrt(3) = h / 400\n\nh = 400 / sqrt(3)\n\nh â‰ˆ 230.94 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tower is approximately 230.94 meters."
