    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the two radii.\n\nThe formula for the arc length (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nWhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the central angle (θ) is 56 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nL = (56/360) × 2 × 3.14159 × 5\n\nL ≈ 0.15556 × 31.4159\n\nL ≈ 4.88198 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\n\nPerimeter = 4.88198 + 2 × 5\n\nPerimeter ≈ 4.88198 + 10\n\nPerimeter ≈ 14.88198\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 14.88 cm."
