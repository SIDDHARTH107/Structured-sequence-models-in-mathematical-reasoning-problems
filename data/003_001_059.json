    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \"b\".\n\nThe theorem can be written as:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe know that a = 6 cm and c = 10 cm, so we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n6² + b² = 10²\n\n36 + b² = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb² = 100 - 36\nb² = 64\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
