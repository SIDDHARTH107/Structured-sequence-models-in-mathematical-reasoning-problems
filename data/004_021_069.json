    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5 - 7x^3 + 2x - 4, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), is found by differentiating each term of the function with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^5)/dx - d(7x^3)/dx + d(2x)/dx - d(4)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule (d(x^n)/dx = nx^(n-1)), we get:\n\nf'(x) = (15x^4) - (21x^2) + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d(15x^4)/dx - d(21x^2)/dx + d(2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = (60x^3) - (42x)\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5 - 7x^3 + 2x - 4 is:\n\nf''(x) = 60x^3 - 42x"
