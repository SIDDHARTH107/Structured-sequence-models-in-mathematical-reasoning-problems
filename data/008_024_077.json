    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the three equations are multiples of each other. Let's divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\n1. 2x + 3y - 5z = 7\n2. 2x + 3y - 5z = 7\n3. 2x + 3y - 5z = 7\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations, and they all lie on the same plane in 3D space. To find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for z:\n\n2x + 3y - 5z = 7\n-5z = -2x - 3y + 7\nz = (2x + 3y - 7) / 5\n\nNow we have the general solution for z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = (2x + 3y - 7) / 5\n\nSince there are infinitely many solutions, we cannot find specific values for x, y, and z. However, we can express z in terms of x and y as shown above."
