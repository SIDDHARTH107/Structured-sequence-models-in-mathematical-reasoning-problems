    "message_2": "To find the number of possible functions from X to X, we need to consider that each element in X can be mapped to any of the three elements in X.\n\nLet the elements of X be {a, b, c}. For each element, there are three choices for where it can be mapped:\n\n1. a can be mapped to a, b, or c.\n2. b can be mapped to a, b, or c.\n3. c can be mapped to a, b, or c.\n\nSince there are three choices for each of the three elements, the total number of possible functions from X to X is 3^3 = 27."
