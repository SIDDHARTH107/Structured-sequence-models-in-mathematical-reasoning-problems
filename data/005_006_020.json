    "message_1": "Suppose the mean weight of a certain type of candy is 20 grams with a standard deviation of 4 grams. If a sample of 50 candies is randomly selected, what is the probability that the average weight of the candies is between 19 and 21 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. In this case, we have a sample size of 50 candies.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean. The formula for this is:\n\nStandard deviation of the sample mean = (Population standard deviation) / sqrt(sample size)\n\nIn our case, the population standard deviation is 4 grams, and the sample size is 50. So, the standard deviation of the sample mean is:\n\nStandard deviation of the sample mean = 4 / sqrt(50) ≈ 0.566\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of average weights (19 and 21 grams). The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere X is the value we want to find the z-score for, μ is the population mean, and σ is the standard deviation of the sample mean.\n\nFor 19 grams:\n\nz1 = (19 - 20) / 0.566 ≈ -1.76\n\nFor 21 grams:\n\nz2 = (21 - 20) / 0.566 ≈ 1.76\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the average weight of the candies is between these z-scores. We can use a z-table or calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(-1.76 < z < 1.76) ≈ 0.9213 - 0.0787 ≈ 0.8426\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the candies is between 19 and 21 grams is approximately 84.26%."
