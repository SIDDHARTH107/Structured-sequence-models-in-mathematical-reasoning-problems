    "message_2": "To prove that there are exactly nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of these groups. Let G be a group of order 36 = 2^2 * 3^2.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the values of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The group G is then the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is isomorphic to the external direct product P_2 x P_3. Since P_2 and P_3 are abelian, their direct product is also abelian. This case does not give a non-abelian group.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the 3-Sylow subgroups. Then, we can consider the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, denoted as P_2 ⋊ P_3. Since P_3 is not normal in G, there are non-trivial semidirect products, which are non-abelian. There are two possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 4 (Z_4 and Z_2 x Z_2) and two possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 9 (Z_9 and Z_3 x Z_3). This gives us a total of 2 * 2 = 4 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n3. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups. Then, we can consider the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, denoted as P_2 ⋊ P_3. Since P_2 is not normal in G, there are non-trivial semidirect products, which are non-abelian. There are two possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 4 (Z_4 and Z_2 x Z_2) and two possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 9 (Z_9 and Z_3 x Z_3). This gives us a total of 2 * 2 = 4 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4 and four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9. Neither of the Sylow subgroups are normal in G. However, we can consider the central product of a 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 and a 3-Sylow subgroup P_3. This construction gives us one additional non-abelian group.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nHowever, providing the complete Cayley tables for all nine non-abelian groups is impractical due to the size of the tables (each table would be 36x36). Instead, we can list the nine non-abelian groups as follows:\n\n1. Z_4 ⋊ Z_9\n2. Z_4 ⋊ (Z_3 x Z_3)\n3. (Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_9\n4. (Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 x Z_3)\n5. Z_9 ⋊ Z_4\n6. Z_9 ⋊ (Z_2 x Z_2)\n7. (Z_3 x Z_3) ⋊ Z_4\n8. (Z_3 x Z_3) ⋊ (Z_2 x Z_2)\n9. Central product of a 2-Sylow subgroup and a 3-Sylow subgroup\n\nThese groups can be further analyzed and their properties studied, but the Cayley tables are too large to include here."
