    "message_2": "To solve the given trigonometric equation, 2sin^2(x) - 3sin(x) = 0, we can first factor out a sin(x) term:\n\nsin(x)(2sin(x) - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we have two separate cases to solve:\n\nCase 1: sin(x) = 0\nx = arcsin(0)\nx = 0째, 180째 (within the range of 0 to 360 degrees)\n\nCase 2: 2sin(x) - 3 = 0\n2sin(x) = 3\nsin(x) = 3/2\n\nHowever, the sine function has a range of -1 to 1, so there is no value of x that satisfies sin(x) = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solutions for the given equation are x = 0째 and x = 180째."
