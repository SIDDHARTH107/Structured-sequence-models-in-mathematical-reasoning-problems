    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nOn a trip, a family of 4 randomly selects a car from 3 available colors (red, blue, and green) and then randomly selects a destination from 4 available options (beach, mountains, city, and countryside). What is the probability that they will select a red car and choose the beach as their destination?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a red car and choosing the beach as their destination, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each event.\n\nThe probability of selecting a red car is 1/3 (since there are 3 car colors to choose from).\n\nThe probability of choosing the beach as their destination is 1/4 (since there are 4 destination options).\n\nNow, multiply the probabilities:\n\n(1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12\n\nSo, the probability that they will select a red car and choose the beach as their destination is 1/12 or approximately 0.0833 (rounded to four decimal places)."
