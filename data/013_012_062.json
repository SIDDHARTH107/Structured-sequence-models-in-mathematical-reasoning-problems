Firm A has a constant marginal cost of $10, while firm B has a constant marginal cost of $5. Find the quantity produced by firm A and firm B in equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantities for firm A and firm B in a Stackelberg competition, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction function for firm B (the follower).\n2. Find the profit function for firm A (the leader) and maximize it with respect to its quantity.\n3. Substitute the reaction function of firm B into the maximized profit function of firm A to find the equilibrium quantity for firm A.\n4. Plug the equilibrium quantity for firm A into the reaction function of firm B to find the equilibrium quantity for firm B.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for firm B\nThe profit function for firm B is given by:\nπ_B = (P - MC_B) * q_B\nwhere MC_B is the marginal cost for firm B, and q_B is the quantity produced by firm B.\n\nGiven the market demand curve P = 100 - 3Q and the fact that Q = q_A + q_B, we can rewrite the profit function for firm B as:\nπ_B = ((100 - 3(q_A + q_B)) - MC_B) * q_B\n\nPlugging in the given MC_B = $5, we get:\nπ_B = ((100 - 3(q_A + q_B)) - 5) * q_B\n\nTo find the reaction function for firm B, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to q_B. To do this, we take the first derivative of π_B with respect to q_B and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π_B)/dq_B = (95 - 3q_A - 6q_B) - q_B = 0\n\nSolving for q_B, we get the reaction function for firm B:\nq_B = (95 - 3q_A)/7\n\nStep 2: Find the profit function for firm A and maximize it with respect to its quantity\nThe profit function for firm A is given by:\nπ_A = (P - MC_A) * q_A\nwhere MC_A is the marginal cost for firm A, and q_A is the quantity produced by firm A.\n\nUsing the market demand curve P = 100 - 3Q and the fact that Q = q_A + q_B, we can rewrite the profit function for firm A as:\nπ_A = ((100 - 3(q_A + q_B)) - MC_A) * q_A\n\nPlugging in the given MC_A = $10, we get:\nπ_A = ((100 - 3(q_A + q_B)) - 10) * q_A\n\nStep 3: Substitute the reaction function of firm B into the maximized profit function of firm A\nNow, we substitute the reaction function of firm B, q_B = (95 - 3q_A)/7, into the profit function of firm A:\n\nπ_A = ((100 - 3(q_A + (95 - 3q_A)/7)) - 10) * q_A\n\nTo maximize the profit function for firm A, we take the first derivative of π_A with respect to q_A and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π_A)/dq_A = 0\n\nSolving this equation for q_A, we get the equilibrium quantity for firm A:\nq_A = 315/16 ≈ 19.69\n\nStep 4: Plug the equilibrium quantity for firm A into the reaction function of firm B\nNow, we plug the equilibrium quantity for firm A, q_A ≈ 19.69, into the reaction function of firm B:\n\nq_B = (95 - 3(19.69))/7 ≈ 7.54\n\nSo, in equilibrium, firm A (the leader) produces approximately 19.69 thousand units, and firm B (the follower) produces approximately 7.54 thousand units."
