    "message_2": "To show that the empty set is a subset of set A, we need to prove that every element in the empty set is also an element in set A.\n\nThe empty set, denoted as âˆ…, is a set that contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A. \n\nBy definition, a subset B of a set A is a set such that every element of B is also an element of A. Since there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A, the empty set is a subset of set A.\n\nThus, we have shown that the empty set is a subset of set A, which is {1, 2, 3}."
