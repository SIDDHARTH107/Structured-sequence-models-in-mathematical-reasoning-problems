    "message_2": "(a) To find the zeros of $f(z)$, we need to solve the equation $z^2 + 1 = 0$. This can be done as follows:\n\n$z^2 = -1$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$z = \\pm i$\n\nSo, the zeros of $f(z)$ are $z = i$ and $z = -i$.\n\n(b) To find the poles of $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator of the function is equal to zero. In this case, we need to solve the equation $(z-2)^2 = 0$. This can be done as follows:\n\n$(z-2)^2 = 0$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$z-2 = 0$\n\nSo, $z = 2$\n\nThus, the pole of $f(z)$ is $z = 2$.\n\n(c) The order of a pole is the number of times it appears in the denominator. In this case, the pole $z = 2$ appears twice in the denominator, as it is squared. Therefore, the order of the pole is 2.\n\n(d) To sketch the poles and zeros of $f(z)$ on an Argand diagram, we plot the zeros at $z = i$ and $z = -i$ and the pole at $z = 2$. The zeros are represented by open circles, and the pole is represented by a filled circle with the number 2 next to it, indicating its order.\n\nHere is a rough sketch of the Argand diagram:\n\n```\n  |\ni o\n  |\n  +-----o-----+-----o----->\n -i    -1     0     1     2\n  |\n  o\n -i\n  |\n```\n\nIn the diagram, the open circles represent the zeros at $z = i$ and $z = -i$, and the filled circle with the number 2 next to it represents the pole of order 2 at $z = 2$."
