    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 10 and 24, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 10: 2 × 5\nPrime factorization of 24: 2 × 2 × 2 × 3\n\nNow, we take the highest powers of all the prime factors from both numbers and multiply them together:\n\n2^3 × 3 × 5 = 8 × 3 × 5 = 120\n\nSo, the LCM of 10 and 24 is 120."
