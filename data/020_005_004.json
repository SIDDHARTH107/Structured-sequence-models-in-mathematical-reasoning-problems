    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer has received a large order for chairs and tables. The profit on each chair is $20 and on each table is $30. The manufacturer can produce a maximum of 300 items. Each chair takes 2 hours to produce and each table takes 3 hours to produce. The manufacturer has a maximum of 500 hours of production time. How many chairs and tables should the manufacturer produce to maximize profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 300 (maximum number of items)\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 500 (maximum production time)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 20x + 30y.\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 300\n   y ≤ 300 - x\n\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 500\n   y ≤ (500 - 2x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. We'll find these intersection points:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and the y-axis (x = 0):\ny = 300 - 0\ny = 300\nPoint: (0, 300)\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and the x-axis (y = 0):\nx + 0 = 300\nx = 300\nPoint: (300, 0)\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and the y-axis (x = 0):\ny = (500 - 2 * 0) / 3\ny = 500 / 3 ≈ 166.67\nPoint: (0, 166.67)\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and the x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 3 * 0 = 500\nx = 250\nPoint: (250, 0)\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2:\nx + y = 300\n2x + 3y = 500\nSolve for x in the first equation: x = 300 - y\nSubstitute into the second equation: 2(300 - y) + 3y = 500\n600 - 2y + 3y = 500\ny = 100\nx = 300 - 100 = 200\nPoint: (200, 100)\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 300), (300, 0), (0, 166.67), (250, 0), and (200, 100).\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 300) = 20(0) + 30(300) = $9,000\nP(300, 0) = 20(300) + 30(0) = $6,000\nP(0, 166.67) = 20(0) + 30(166.67) ≈ $5,000.10\nP(250, 0) = 20(250) + 30(0) = $5,000\nP(200, 100) = 20(200) + 30(100) = $7,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $9,000, which occurs when the manufacturer produces 0 chairs and 300 tables."
