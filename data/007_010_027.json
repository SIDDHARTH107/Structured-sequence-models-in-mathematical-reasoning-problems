    "message_2": "Let's denote the number we are looking for as x. According to the given conditions, we can write the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 5 (mod 6)\nx ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n\nTo solve this system of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we first find the product of the moduli, which is N = 6 * 5 = 30.\n\nNext, we compute the individual modular inverses. We have:\n\nN1 = N/6 = 30/6 = 5\nN2 = N/5 = 30/5 = 6\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of N1 and N2 with respect to the other moduli:\n\nN1_inverse ≡ 5^(-1) (mod 6)\nN2_inverse ≡ 6^(-1) (mod 5)\n\nBy trying out different values, we find that:\n\nN1_inverse = 5 (since 5 * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 6))\nN2_inverse = 1 (since 6 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\n\nNow, we can find the solution to the system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 5 * 5 * 5 + 4 * 6 * 1 (mod 30)\nx ≡ 125 + 24 (mod 30)\nx ≡ 149 (mod 30)\n\nReducing the result modulo 30, we get:\n\nx ≡ 29 (mod 30)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is x = 29."
