    "message_2": "The eight non-abelian groups of order 40 can be classified as follows:\n\n1. D_20: Dihedral group of order 2 * 20 = 40\n2. QD_20: Quasidihedral group of order 40\n3. SD_20: Semidihedral group of order 40\n4. C_2 × D_20: Direct product of cyclic group of order 2 and dihedral group of order 20\n5. C_2 × QD_20: Direct product of cyclic group of order 2 and quasidihedral group of order 20\n6. C_2 × SD_20: Direct product of cyclic group of order 2 and semidihedral group of order 20\n7. C_4 × D_10: Direct product of cyclic group of order 4 and dihedral group of order 10\n8. C_4 × QD_10: Direct product of cyclic group of order 4 and quasidihedral group of order 10\n\nLet's construct the Cayley table for the dihedral group D_20 as an example. The dihedral group D_20 has 20 elements, which can be represented as {r^i, s * r^i} for i = 0, 1, ..., 19, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The group operation is defined as follows:\n\n1. r^i * r^j = r^(i + j) (mod 20)\n2. r^i * s * r^j = s * r^(i - j) (mod 20)\n3. s * r^i * r^j = s * r^(i + j) (mod 20)\n4. s * r^i * s * r^j = r^(i - j) (mod 20)\n\nThe Cayley table for D_20 can be constructed using these rules. Due to the size of the table (40x40), it is not feasible to write it out here. However, you can create the table in a spreadsheet or use software like GAP (Groups, Algorithms, Programming) to generate the table."
