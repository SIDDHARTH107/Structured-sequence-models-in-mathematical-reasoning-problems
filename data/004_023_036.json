    "message_2": "To find the area bounded between the curves y = x^2 + 1 and y = 2x - 3 over the interval [1, 3], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 + 1 = 2x - 3\n\nRearrange the equation to find the x values:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the x values:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 4:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 16)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (4 - 16) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means that the two curves do not intersect over the interval [1, 3]. Therefore, we can find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [1, 3]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 3 - (x^2 + 1)) dx from 1 to 3\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2 - 4) dx from 1 to 3\n\nNow, integrate the function:\n\nArea = [x^2 - (1/3)x^3 - 4x] from 1 to 3\n\nNext, apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n\nArea = (3^2 - (1/3)(3^3) - 4(3)) - (1^2 - (1/3)(1^3) - 4(1))\nArea = (9 - 27 - 12) - (1 - 1/3 - 4)\nArea = (-30) - (-3 + 1/3)\nArea = -30 + 3 - 1/3\nArea = -27 - 1/3\nArea = -82/3\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = 82/3 square units"
