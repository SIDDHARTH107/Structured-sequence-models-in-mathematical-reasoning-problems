    "message_1": "A triangle with sides of length 5, 7, and x has an angle opposite the side of length x of 60 degrees. What is the length of x? Use the law of cosines to solve the triangle.",
    "message_2": "To solve the triangle using the Law of Cosines, we can use the formula:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c. In this case, we have:\n\nx² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(60°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 60°. In degrees, cos(60°) = 1/2.\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the equation:\n\nx² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * (1/2)\n\nx² = 25 + 49 - 35\n\nx² = 74 - 35\n\nx² = 39\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 39 to get the length of x:\n\nx = √39\n\nx ≈ 6.24\n\nSo, the length of side x is approximately 6.24 units."
