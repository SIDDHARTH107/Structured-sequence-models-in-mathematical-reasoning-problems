    "message_1": "A furniture company needs to decide how many chairs and tables to produce in order to maximize their profit. The company has a limited amount of wood and labor hours available. Each chair requires 4 labor hours and 6 square feet of wood, while each table requires 7 labor hours and 9 square feet of wood. The profit for each chair is $20 and for each table is $30. The company wants to produce at least 10 chairs and 5 tables. Using mixed-integer programming, what is the maximum profit the company can achieve while satisfying their constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Wood constraint: 6x + 9y ≤ W (W is the total amount of wood available)\n2. Labor constraint: 4x + 7y ≤ L (L is the total amount of labor hours available)\n3. Minimum chairs constraint: x ≥ 10\n4. Minimum tables constraint: y ≥ 5\n5. Non-negativity constraints: x, y ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to know the values of W and L, the total amount of wood and labor hours available. Please provide these values."
