    "message_2": "The statement that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers is known as the Goldbach Conjecture. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values, and it has been found to hold true in every case. However, it has not been proven or disproven for all even integers.\n\nAs a mathematician, I cannot provide the smallest even integer greater than 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, because no such number has been found or proven to exist."
