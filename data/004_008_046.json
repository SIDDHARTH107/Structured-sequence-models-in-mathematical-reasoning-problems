    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4 at the point (2, 2), we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, which represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4 is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 3\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 2). To do this, we plug in the x-coordinate of the point into the derivative:\n\nf'(2) = 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4 at the point (2, 2) is 1."
