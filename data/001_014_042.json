    "message_2": "To simplify the expression $\\sqrt{12}$, we can find the prime factors of 12 and look for pairs of the same factors.\n\n$12 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3$\n\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$\\sqrt{12} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 2 \\times 3}$\n\nSince we have a pair of 2's, we can take one 2 out of the square root:\n\n$\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is $2\\sqrt{3}$."
