    "message_1": "A Sierpinski Arrowhead Curve is constructed by starting with a triangle and recursively removing the middle section of each side and replacing it with two connecting segments. If the initial triangle has a side length of 4 units, what is the total length of the curve after two iterations?",
    "message_2": "After the first iteration, each side of the initial triangle is replaced by two segments, each of length 1/2 of the original side length. So, each side becomes 2 * (4/2) = 4 units long. Since there are three sides in the triangle, the total length after the first iteration is 3 * 4 = 12 units.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the 3 sides from the first iteration is replaced by two segments, each of length 1/2 of the original side length. So, each side becomes 2 * (4/4) = 2 units long. Since there are 9 segments in total (3 sides from the first iteration, each replaced by 3 segments), the total length after the second iteration is 9 * 2 = 18 units."
