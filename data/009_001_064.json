    "message_1": "Suppose a population of bacteria is initially 500 and is growing at a rate proportional to its size with a proportionality constant of 0.02 per hour. Write a differential equation to model the population growth and solve it to find the size of the population after 12 hours.",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth, we can use the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population size, t is time in hours, and k is the proportionality constant (0.02 per hour).\n\nFirst, we need to solve this differential equation. We can rewrite it as:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(dP/P) = ∫(k dt)\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 500:\n\nln(500) = 0.02 * 0 + C\n\nC = ln(500)\n\nNow we have the general solution:\n\nln(P) = 0.02t + ln(500)\n\nTo find the population after 12 hours, plug in t = 12:\n\nln(P) = 0.02 * 12 + ln(500)\n\nln(P) = 0.24 + ln(500)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to solve for P:\n\nP = e^(0.24 + ln(500))\n\nP = e^0.24 * e^ln(500)\n\nP = e^0.24 * 500\n\nP ≈ 1.271 * 500\n\nP ≈ 635.5\n\nAfter 12 hours, the population size will be approximately 635.5 bacteria."
