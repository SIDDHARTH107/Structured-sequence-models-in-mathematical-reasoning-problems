    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x - 5 < 10, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 5 to both sides of the inequality.\n3x - 5 + 5 < 10 + 5\n3x < 15\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the inequality by 3.\n3x/3 < 15/3\nx < 5\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x < 5. This means that any real number less than 5 will satisfy the inequality."
