    "message_1": "Suppose that a teacher wants to divide 21 students into groups of 3 for a group project. How many different ways can the teacher make the groupings such that each student is in a group with exactly two other students?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, k is the number of students in each group, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, the teacher wants to divide 21 students into groups of 3. Since there are 21 students and each group has 3 students, there will be a total of 21/3 = 7 groups.\n\nNow, we will calculate the number of ways to form each group:\n\nC(21, 3) = 21! / (3!(21-3)!) = 21! / (3!18!) = (21 × 20 × 19) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 1330\n\nHowever, this result gives us the number of ways to form a single group of 3 students out of 21. Since we need to form 7 groups, we have to divide this result by the number of ways to arrange the 7 groups, which is 7! (factorial).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n1330 / 7! = 1330 / (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 1330 / 5040 = 0.264\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a way to form groups, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, there is 1 distinct way to divide the 21 students into groups of 3 such that each student is in a group with exactly two other students."
