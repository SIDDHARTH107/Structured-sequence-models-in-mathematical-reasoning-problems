    "message_2": "The Gosper curve is a fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. After each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of (√7). \n\nTo find the total length of the Gosper curve after 4 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (√7)^Iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and there are 4 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (√7)^4\nLength = 1 * (7^2)\nLength = 1 * 49\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 4 iterations is 49 units."
