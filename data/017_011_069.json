    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. We will use Sylow's theorems to determine the possible structures of G. Recall that the order of G can be factored as 12 = 2^2 * 3.\n\nSylow's First Theorem states that for any prime p dividing the order of G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G. In our case, we have prime factors 2 and 3.\n\nSylow's Second Theorem states that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other. In particular, this means that the number of Sylow p-subgroups divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\nFor p = 2, we have the following possibilities for n_2: 1, 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal in G. If n_2 = 3, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, none of which are normal in G.\n\nFor p = 3, we have the following possibilities for n_3: 1, 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. If n_3 = 4, then there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, none of which are normal in G.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since P_2 and P_3 are both normal, their product P_2 * P_3 is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are relatively prime, we have |P_2 * P_3| = |P_2| * |P_3| = 12. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is the cyclic group C12.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is normal, G/P_2 is a group of order 3, which must be cyclic. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 4 and a quotient group of order 3, so G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of these two groups. This is the dihedral group D6.\n\n3. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has three non-normal Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since P_3 is normal, G/P_3 is a group of order 4, which must be either cyclic or the Klein four-group. In either case, G has a normal subgroup of order 3 and a quotient group of order 4, so G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of these two groups. This is the alternating group A4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic group C12, the dihedral group D6, or the alternating group A4."
