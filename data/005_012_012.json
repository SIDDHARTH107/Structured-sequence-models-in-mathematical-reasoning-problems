If a sample of 50 pencils is randomly selected from a production line, what is the probability that the mean length of the sample is between 19.5 and 20.5 centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the information, we have:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 20 cm\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 0.5 cm\nSample size (n) = 50\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (also known as the standard error), which is given by the formula:\n\nStandard error (SE) = σ / √n\n\nSE = 0.5 / √50 ≈ 0.0707 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the range we are interested in (19.5 cm and 20.5 cm). The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower bound (19.5 cm):\nz1 = (19.5 - 20) / 0.0707 ≈ -7.07\n\nFor the upper bound (20.5 cm):\nz2 = (20.5 - 20) / 0.0707 ≈ 7.07\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean falls between these z-scores. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the probabilities associated with these z-scores.\n\nP(z1) ≈ 0 (since -7.07 is far in the left tail of the normal distribution)\nP(z2) ≈ 1 (since 7.07 is far in the right tail of the normal distribution)\n\nThe probability that the sample mean falls between 19.5 cm and 20.5 cm is given by:\n\nP(19.5 < X < 20.5) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nSo, there is a 100% probability that the mean length of the sample is between 19.5 and 20.5 centimeters."
