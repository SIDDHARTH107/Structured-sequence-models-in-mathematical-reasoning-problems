Assume that the plate has a thermal diffusivity of 0.01 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution u(x,y) after one hour, we can use the heat equation and its solution in terms of Fourier series. The heat equation for a two-dimensional plate with constant thermal diffusivity α is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nThe given initial temperature distribution is f(x,y) = 10sin(2πx)sin(πy). Since the plate is cooled uniformly on both sides with a constant temperature of 0°C, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,y,t) = u(1,y,t) = u(x,0,t) = u(x,1,t) = 0\n\nWe can represent the solution u(x,y,t) as a double Fourier series:\n\nu(x,y,t) = ∑∑A(m,n)sin(mπx)sin(nπy)e^(-απ²(m²+n²)t)\n\nwhere A(m,n) are the coefficients to be determined from the initial condition u(x,y,0) = f(x,y). To find A(m,n), we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nA(m,n) = ∫∫f(x,y)sin(mπx)sin(nπy)dxdy\n\nSince f(x,y) = 10sin(2πx)sin(πy), we have:\n\nA(m,n) = 10∫∫sin(2πx)sin(πy)sin(mπx)sin(nπy)dxdy\n\nThe only non-zero coefficient is A(2,1), which can be found by evaluating the integral:\n\nA(2,1) = 10∫₀^1∫₀^1sin(2πx)sin(πy)sin(2πx)sin(πy)dxdy = 10\n\nThus, the temperature distribution after one hour (t = 3600 s) is:\n\nu(x,y,t) = 10sin(2πx)sin(πy)e^(-απ²(5)t)\n\nWith α = 0.01 m²/s, we have:\n\nu(x,y,3600) = 10sin(2πx)sin(πy)e^(-0.01π²(5)3600)\n\nSo, the temperature distribution after one hour is:\n\nu(x,y,3600) = 10sin(2πx)sin(πy)e^(-1800π²)"
