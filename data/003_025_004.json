    "message_1": "A plane is initially flying due east at a speed of 240 km/h. Suddenly, it encounters a wind blowing to the north-east at a speed of 60 km/h. \n\nWhat is the plane's new velocity with respect to the ground, and what is the plane's new heading? (Provide your answer as a magnitude and a direction, measured in degrees from due east.)",
    "message_2": "To find the plane's new velocity with respect to the ground, we need to add the velocity vectors of the plane and the wind. Let's represent the plane's velocity vector as P and the wind's velocity vector as W. \n\nP = 240 km/h (due east)\nW = 60 km/h (north-east)\n\nWe can break down the wind's velocity vector into its eastward (x) and northward (y) components. Since the wind is blowing to the north-east, it forms a 45-degree angle with the eastward direction. Using trigonometry, we can find the x and y components of the wind's velocity vector:\n\nWx = 60 * cos(45°) = 60 * (√2 / 2) = 30√2 km/h (eastward)\nWy = 60 * sin(45°) = 60 * (√2 / 2) = 30√2 km/h (northward)\n\nNow, we can add the x and y components of the plane's velocity vector (P) and the wind's velocity vector (W):\n\nPx = 240 km/h (eastward)\nPy = 0 km/h (northward)\n\nResultant velocity vector Rx = Px + Wx = 240 + 30√2 km/h (eastward)\nResultant velocity vector Ry = Py + Wy = 0 + 30√2 km/h (northward)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity vector R using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nR = √(Rx^2 + Ry^2) = √((240 + 30√2)^2 + (30√2)^2) ≈ 258.77 km/h\n\nTo find the plane's new heading, we can calculate the angle θ between the resultant velocity vector and the eastward direction using the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Ry / Rx) = arctan((30√2) / (240 + 30√2)) ≈ 14.04°\n\nSo, the plane's new velocity with respect to the ground is approximately 258.77 km/h, and its new heading is approximately 14.04° north of due east."
