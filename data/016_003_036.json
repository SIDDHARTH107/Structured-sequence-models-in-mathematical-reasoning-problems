    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a complex fractal, and its area cannot be calculated directly using traditional mathematical methods. However, we can approximate the area using numerical methods such as the Monte Carlo method.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. The largest completely connected component of the Mandelbrot set is the main cardioid, which is the main body of the set.\n\nTo approximate the area of the largest completely connected component of the Mandelbrot set after 7 iterations, we can use the Monte Carlo method as follows:\n\n1. Define a bounding box around the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set. A common choice is the square with vertices at (-2, -2), (-2, 2), (2, 2), and (2, -2).\n\n2. Generate a large number of random points within this bounding box.\n\n3. For each point, check if it belongs to the Mandelbrot set after 7 iterations. If the magnitude of the complex number remains less than or equal to 2 after 7 iterations, it is considered to be part of the set.\n\n4. Calculate the ratio of points that belong to the Mandelbrot set to the total number of points generated.\n\n5. Multiply this ratio by the area of the bounding box to obtain an approximation of the area of the largest completely connected component of the Mandelbrot set after 7 iterations.\n\nNote that this method provides an approximation, and the accuracy of the result depends on the number of random points generated. The true area of the Mandelbrot set is still an open question in mathematics."
