    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime gap between two primes greater than 1,000, we need to find the first pair of consecutive prime numbers greater than 1,000.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 1,000 is 1,001, but it's not a prime since it's divisible by 7 and 143. The next number, 1,002, is also not prime since it's even. The next number, 1,003, is a prime number.\n\nNow, we need to find the next prime number after 1,003. The next number, 1,004, is not prime since it's even. The next number, 1,005, is not prime since it's divisible by 5. The next number, 1,006, is also not prime since it's even. The next number, 1,007, is not prime since it's divisible by 19 and 53. The next number, 1,008, is not prime since it's even. The next number, 1,009, is not prime since it's divisible by 7. Finally, the next number, 1,010, is also not prime since it's even.\n\nThe next number, 1,011, is a prime number.\n\nSo, the smallest prime gap between two primes greater than 1,000 is between 1,003 and 1,011. The gap is 1,011 - 1,003 = 8."
