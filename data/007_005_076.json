    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 6 and 15 can be found by first listing the prime factors of each number:\n\n6 = 2 × 3\n15 = 3 × 5\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factorization and multiply them together:\n\nLCM(6, 15) = 2^1 × 3^1 × 5^1 = 2 × 3 × 5 = 30\n\nSo, the LCM of 6 and 15 is 30."
