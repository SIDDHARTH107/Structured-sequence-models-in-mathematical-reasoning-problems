    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total Gaussian curvature of a surface to its topological properties. For a closed surface like a sphere, the theorem states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over the entire surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic χ of the surface:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nFor a sphere, the Euler characteristic χ is 2. The Gaussian curvature K of a sphere with radius r is given by:\n\nK = 1/r^2\n\nIn our case, the radius r is 5 cm. So, the Gaussian curvature K is:\n\nK = 1/(5^2) = 1/25 cm^(-2)\n\nNow, we can apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the total Gaussian curvature of the surface:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nLet T be the total Gaussian curvature:\n\nT = ∫∫_S (1/25) dA = (1/25) ∫∫_S dA\n\nSince the surface is a sphere, the surface area A can be calculated as:\n\nA = 4πr^2 = 4π(5^2) = 100π cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total Gaussian curvature T:\n\nT = (1/25) * 100π = 4π\n\nSo, the total Gaussian curvature of the spherical surface with a radius of 5 cm is 4π."
