    "message_2": "First, note that the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2). By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3).\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is isomorphic to C9. In this case, G is a cyclic group, and it is well-known that all subgroups of a cyclic group are normal. So, if G is isomorphic to C9, then all subgroups of G are normal.\n\nNext, consider the case where G is isomorphic to C3 × C3. In this case, G is an abelian group, and it is well-known that all subgroups of an abelian group are normal. So, if G is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then all subgroups of G are normal.\n\nNow, let's find all subgroups of G. If G is isomorphic to C9, then the subgroups of G are {e}, G itself, and all cyclic subgroups generated by elements of order 3 (since 3 is the only divisor of 9 other than 1 and 9). There are two such subgroups, both of order 3, and they are both normal as discussed earlier.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then the subgroups of G are {e}, G itself, and all direct products of cyclic subgroups of the two C3 factors. There are three such subgroups, all of order 3, and they are all normal as discussed earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 9, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the abelian group C3 × C3. In either case, all subgroups of G are normal."
