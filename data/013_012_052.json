    "message_2": "a) Firm 1 is the leader and Firm 2 is the follower.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the reaction function for Firm 2 (follower). To do this, we first find the profit function for Firm 2:\n\nπ2(Q2) = P * Q2 - C2(Q2) = (100 - 2(Q1 + Q2)) * Q2 - 20Q2\n\nNow, we take the first derivative of π2(Q2) with respect to Q2 and set it equal to 0 to find the profit-maximizing quantity for Firm 2:\n\ndπ2(Q2)/dQ2 = -4Q1 - 6Q2 + 100 = 0\n\nSolving for Q2, we get the reaction function for Firm 2:\n\nQ2 = (100 - 4Q1) / 6\n\nStep 2: Calculate the profit function for Firm 1 (leader) taking into account the reaction function of Firm 2:\n\nπ1(Q1) = P * Q1 - C1(Q1) = (100 - 2(Q1 + (100 - 4Q1) / 6)) * Q1 - 10Q1\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nπ1(Q1) = (100 - 2Q1 - (100 - 4Q1) / 3) * Q1 - 10Q1\n\nπ1(Q1) = (200 - 6Q1) / 3 * Q1 - 10Q1\n\nπ1(Q1) = (200 - 6Q1) * Q1 / 3 - 10Q1\n\nStep 3: Take the first derivative of π1(Q1) with respect to Q1 and set it equal to 0 to find the profit-maximizing quantity for Firm 1:\n\ndπ1(Q1)/dQ1 = (200 - 12Q1) / 3 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for Q1, we get:\n\nQ1 = 15\n\nStep 4: Plug Q1 back into the reaction function for Firm 2 to find the profit-maximizing quantity for Firm 2:\n\nQ2 = (100 - 4 * 15) / 6 = 10\n\nStep 5: Calculate the corresponding profits for each firm:\n\nP = 100 - 2(Q1 + Q2) = 100 - 2(15 + 10) = 50\n\nπ1 = P * Q1 - C1(Q1) = 50 * 15 - 10 * 15 = 600\nπ2 = P * Q2 - C2(Q2) = 50 * 10 - 20 * 10 = 300\n\nSo, when Firm 1 is the leader and Firm 2 is the follower, the profit-maximizing quantities are Q1 = 15 and Q2 = 10, with corresponding profits of π1 = 600 and π2 = 300.\n\nb) Firm 2 is the leader and Firm 1 is the follower.\n\nWe can follow the same steps as above, but now Firm 1 is the follower and Firm 2 is the leader. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the reaction function for Firm 1 (follower):\n\nQ1 = (100 - 6Q2) / 4\n\nStep 2: Calculate the profit function for Firm 2 (leader) taking into account the reaction function of Firm 1:\n\nπ2(Q2) = (100 - 2((100 - 6Q2) / 4 + Q2)) * Q2 - 20Q2\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nπ2(Q2) = (100 - (100 - 6Q2) / 2) * Q2 - 20Q2\n\nπ2(Q2) = (200 - 4Q2) * Q2 / 2 - 20Q2\n\nStep 3: Take the first derivative of π2(Q2) with respect to Q2 and set it equal to 0 to find the profit-maximizing quantity for Firm 2:\n\ndπ2(Q2)/dQ2 = (200 - 8Q2) / 2 - 20 = 0\n\nSolving for Q2, we get:\n\nQ2 = 10\n\nStep 4: Plug Q2 back into the reaction function for Firm 1 to find the profit-maximizing quantity for Firm 1:\n\nQ1 = (100 - 6 * 10) / 4 = 10\n\nStep 5: Calculate the corresponding profits for each firm:\n\nP = 100 - 2(Q1 + Q2) = 100 - 2(10 + 10) = 60\n\nπ1 = P * Q1 - C1(Q1) = 60 * 10 - 10 * 10 = 500\nπ2 = P * Q2 - C2(Q2) = 60 * 10 - 20 * 10 = 400\n\nSo, when Firm 2 is the leader and Firm 1 is the follower, the profit-maximizing quantities are Q1 = 10 and Q2 = 10, with corresponding profits of π1 = 500 and π2 = 400."
