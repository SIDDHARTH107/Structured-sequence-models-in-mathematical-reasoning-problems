    "message_2": "To find the largest angle, we need to look at the side with the greatest length, which is 12. Let's call the angle opposite to this side C. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the measure of angle C.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states: c² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C), where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite to side c.\n\nIn our case, a = 8, b = 10, and c = 12. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n12² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos(C)\n\n80 = 160 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 80 / 160\n\ncos(C) = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C whose cosine is 0.5. Using the inverse cosine function (also known as arccos or cos^(-1)), we get:\n\nC = arccos(0.5)\n\nC ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 60°."
