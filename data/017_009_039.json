    "message_2": "First, we note that since the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), G must be a p-group. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, G must be isomorphic to either C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3).\n\nNow, let's prove the first part of the statement: G is isomorphic to C9 if and only if |a|=9.\n\n(⇒) Suppose G is isomorphic to C9. Then there exists an element a in G such that |a|=9, since C9 has a generator of order 9. Thus, if G is isomorphic to C9, there exists an element a with order 9.\n\n(⇐) Conversely, suppose there exists an element a in G with order 9. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, ⟨a⟩, has order 9. Since the order of ⟨a⟩ divides the order of G, and both have order 9, it follows that G = ⟨a⟩. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 9, and G is isomorphic to C9.\n\nNow, let's prove the second part of the statement: G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9 if and only if |a|=3.\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in the problem statement. There is no non-abelian group of order 9. All groups of order 9 are abelian, as we showed earlier that G must be isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3, both of which are abelian groups."
