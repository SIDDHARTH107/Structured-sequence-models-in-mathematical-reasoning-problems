The density of the plate, ρ, is 1 g/cm^3. Use the finite element method with a uniform mesh of 20 x 20 elements to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the finite element method (FEM), we first need to set up the governing equation for steady-state heat conduction. The governing equation for steady-state heat conduction in two dimensions is given by:\n\n∇²u(x,y) = -Q(x,y) / (k * c_p * ρ)\n\nwhere ∇² is the Laplacian operator, u(x,y) is the temperature distribution, Q(x,y) is the heat source, k is the thermal conductivity, c_p is the specific heat, and ρ is the density of the plate.\n\nSince k = 1 W/m*K, c_p = 1 J/g*K, and ρ = 1 g/cm^3 = 1000 kg/m^3, the governing equation becomes:\n\n∇²u(x,y) = -Q(x,y) / 1000\n\nNow, we need to discretize the domain into a uniform mesh of 20 x 20 elements. This means that the spacing between nodes in both the x and y directions is Δx = Δy = 1/20 = 0.05 m.\n\nNext, we need to approximate the Laplacian operator using finite differences. The second-order central difference approximation for the Laplacian operator is given by:\n\n∇²u(x,y) ≈ (u(x+Δx,y) - 2u(x,y) + u(x-Δx,y))/Δx² + (u(x,y+Δy) - 2u(x,y) + u(x,y-Δy))/Δy²\n\nSince Δx = Δy, we can simplify this expression to:\n\n∇²u(x,y) ≈ (u(x+Δx,y) - 2u(x,y) + u(x-Δx,y) + u(x,y+Δy) - 2u(x,y) + u(x,y-Δy))/Δx²\n\nNow, we can set up a system of linear equations for the unknown temperatures at the interior nodes of the mesh. For each interior node (i,j), we have:\n\n(u(i+1,j) - 4u(i,j) + u(i-1,j) + u(i,j+1) + u(i,j-1))/Δx² = -Q(i,j) / 1000\n\nWe can rewrite this system of equations in matrix form as Au = b, where A is a matrix containing the coefficients of the unknown temperatures, u is a vector of the unknown temperatures, and b is a vector containing the known heat sources and boundary conditions.\n\nFinally, we can solve this linear system of equations using a numerical method, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the conjugate gradient method, to obtain the steady-state temperature distribution u(x,y) for the square plate.\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the finite element method requires programming skills and the use of specialized software or libraries. The explanation provided here is a high-level overview of the steps involved in solving the given problem using FEM."
