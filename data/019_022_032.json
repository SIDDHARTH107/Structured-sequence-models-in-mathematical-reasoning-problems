    "message_1": "A grocery store has two brands of pasta sauce: Brand A costs $3 per jar and Brand B costs $4 per jar. Amanda needs to buy 10 jars of pasta sauce for her restaurant. She thinks that Brand A tastes just as good as Brand B, but wants to save as much money as possible. Using decision theory, what is the best brand of pasta sauce for Amanda to buy?",
    "message_2": "Using decision theory, we can compare the costs of buying 10 jars of each brand of pasta sauce to determine the best option for Amanda.\n\nCost of Brand A: 10 jars * $3 per jar = $30\nCost of Brand B: 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40\n\nSince Amanda believes that both brands taste the same and her goal is to save as much money as possible, the best brand of pasta sauce for her to buy is Brand A, as it will cost her $30 instead of $40 for Brand B."
