    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and let A be a subset of U such that A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Find the complement of A and find the union of A and its complement. Show that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', can be found by subtracting the elements of A from the universal set U:\n\nA' = U - A = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements of both sets. In this case, we combine the elements of A and A':\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThis demonstrates that the union of a set and its complement is equal to the universal set."
