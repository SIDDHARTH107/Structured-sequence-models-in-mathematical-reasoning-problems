    "message_1": "A company can maximize its profits by manufacturing and selling two types of products: Product A and Product B. The selling price of each unit of Product A is $60, and the selling price of each unit of Product B is $80. It takes 3 hours to manufacture a unit of Product A and 4 hours to manufacture a unit of Product B. The company has a total of 300 manufacturing hours available per day. If the company wants to maximize its profits, how many units of A and B should it produce each day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe total profit can be represented as:\nProfit = 60x + 80y\n\nThe constraint on the manufacturing hours can be represented as:\n3x + 4y ≤ 300\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraint and give the highest profit.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraint equation for y:\ny ≤ (300 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we can use the integer values of x and find the corresponding integer values of y that satisfy the constraint. Then, we can calculate the profit for each combination and find the maximum profit.\n\nx = 0: y ≤ (300 - 3*0) / 4 = 75\ny = 75 (maximum integer value)\n\nProfit = 60*0 + 80*75 = $6000\n\nx = 1: y ≤ (300 - 3*1) / 4 = 74.25\ny = 74 (maximum integer value)\n\nProfit = 60*1 + 80*74 = $6060\n\nx = 2: y ≤ (300 - 3*2) / 4 = 73.5\ny = 73 (maximum integer value)\n\nProfit = 60*2 + 80*73 = $6120\n\nWe can continue this process, but we can notice that the profit increases by $60 each time we increase x by 1 and decrease y by 1. This is because the selling price of Product A is $60, and we are essentially replacing one unit of Product B with one unit of Product A while still satisfying the constraint.\n\nTherefore, we can continue this process until we reach the maximum possible value of x while still satisfying the constraint.\n\nx = 100: y ≤ (300 - 3*100) / 4 = 0\ny = 0 (maximum integer value)\n\nProfit = 60*100 + 80*0 = $6000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 2 units of Product A and 73 units of Product B, resulting in a total profit of $6120 per day."
