    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 fishermen sharing a fishing ground, and each of them can catch a maximum of 20 fish per day. The total fish stock in the fishing ground is 180 fish per day. If each fisherman fishes at their maximum capacity every day, what is the total catch of the fishing ground every day? Furthermore, if each fisherman reduces their catch by 50%, what is the total catch of the fishing ground every day and what is the maximum total profit that the fishermen can achieve if they cooperate?",
    "message_2": "If each fisherman fishes at their maximum capacity every day, they would catch a total of 10 fishermen * 20 fish per fisherman = 200 fish per day. However, the total fish stock in the fishing ground is only 180 fish per day. Therefore, the total catch of the fishing ground every day would be limited to 180 fish.\n\nIf each fisherman reduces their catch by 50%, they would catch 20 fish per fisherman * 0.5 = 10 fish per fisherman. The total catch of the fishing ground every day would then be 10 fishermen * 10 fish per fisherman = 100 fish per day.\n\nTo maximize their total profit, the fishermen should cooperate and share the fishing ground's resources sustainably. By reducing their catch to 10 fish per fisherman, they can ensure that the fishing ground remains productive and does not get depleted. This way, they can continue to catch 100 fish per day collectively, which would be more profitable in the long run compared to overfishing and depleting the fishing ground."
