    "message_1": "Suppose there are two bidders in an auction for a painting. The value of the painting to bidder 1 is $5000 and to bidder 2 is $7000. However, bidder 1 has a probability of 0.6 of valuing the painting at $1000 instead of $5000. Suppose the auction is second-price sealed-bid (Vickrey) auction, where the bidder with the highest valuation wins the painting and pays the price of the second-highest valuation. What would be the optimal strategy for each bidder in this situation?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid (Vickrey) auction, the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation of the item. This is because the winner pays the second-highest bid, so there is no incentive to overbid or underbid.\n\nFor bidder 1, there is a 0.6 probability of valuing the painting at $1000 and a 0.4 probability of valuing it at $5000. Bidder 1's expected valuation is:\n\nE(V1) = 0.6 * $1000 + 0.4 * $5000 = $600 + $2000 = $2600\n\nSo, bidder 1's optimal strategy is to bid $1000 with a probability of 0.6 and $5000 with a probability of 0.4.\n\nBidder 2 values the painting at $7000. Since there is no uncertainty in bidder 2's valuation, their optimal strategy is to bid their true valuation, which is $7000.\n\nIn summary, the optimal strategy for bidder 1 is to bid $1000 with a probability of 0.6 and $5000 with a probability of 0.4, while the optimal strategy for bidder 2 is to bid $7000."
