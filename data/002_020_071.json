    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm and the central angle is 45 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (45/360) * 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/8) * 16π\nArc length = 2π cm\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the length of the arc to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = 2π + 2(8)\nPerimeter = 2π + 16\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is 2π + 16 cm."
