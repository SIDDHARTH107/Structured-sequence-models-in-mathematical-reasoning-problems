    "message_1": "Suppose that on a particular stretch of road, the probability of a car accident being a rear-end collision is 0.15. If there are 50 car accidents on this road in a given month, how many of these accidents can we expect to be rear-end collisions?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of rear-end collisions, we can multiply the total number of car accidents by the probability of a car accident being a rear-end collision.\n\nExpected number of rear-end collisions = Total number of car accidents × Probability of rear-end collision\nExpected number of rear-end collisions = 50 × 0.15\nExpected number of rear-end collisions = 7.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a car accident, we can round the expected number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can expect approximately 8 rear-end collisions in a given month on this stretch of road."
