    "message_2": "To determine the singular points of the algebraic variety described by the equation x^2 + y^2 - 2z^2 = 0, we first need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂f/∂z = -4z\n\nA point (x, y, z) is a singular point if all the partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, i.e., ∂f/∂x = ∂f/∂y = ∂f/∂z = 0. From the partial derivatives, we have:\n\n2x = 0 => x = 0\n2y = 0 => y = 0\n-4z = 0 => z = 0\n\nThe only point that satisfies all these conditions is the origin (0, 0, 0). So, the algebraic variety has a singular point at the origin.\n\nNow, we need to classify the singular point as either a node, cusp, or double point. We can do this by analyzing the Hessian matrix of the second partial derivatives:\n\nH(f) = | ∂²f/∂x²  ∂²f/∂x∂y  ∂²f/∂x∂z |\n          | ∂²f/∂y∂x  ∂²f/∂y²  ∂²f/∂y∂z |\n          | ∂²f/∂z∂x  ∂²f/∂z∂y  ∂²f/∂z² |\n\nComputing the second partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 2\n∂²f/∂x∂y = ∂²f/∂y∂x = 0\n∂²f/∂x∂z = ∂²f/∂z∂x = 0\n∂²f/∂y² = 2\n∂²f/∂y∂z = ∂²f/∂z∂y = 0\n∂²f/∂z² = -4\n\nSo, the Hessian matrix is:\n\nH(f) = |  2  0  0 |\n          |  0  2  0 |\n          |  0  0 -4 |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\ndet(H(f)) = 2 * (2*(-4) - 0) - 0 * (0 - 0) + 0 * (0 - 0) = -16\n\nSince the determinant of the Hessian matrix is non-zero at the singular point (0, 0, 0), the singular point is a non-degenerate singular point. Furthermore, since the Hessian matrix has one positive eigenvalue (2) and one negative eigenvalue (-4), the singular point is a hyperbolic saddle point, which is a type of node.\n\nIn conclusion, the algebraic variety described by the equation x^2 + y^2 - 2z^2 = 0 has a singular point at the origin (0, 0, 0), and this point is a node."
