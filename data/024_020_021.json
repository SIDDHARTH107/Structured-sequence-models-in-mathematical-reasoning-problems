    "message_2": "The Hopf map, also known as the Hopf fibration, is a continuous map from the 3-sphere S³ onto the 2-sphere S². It is denoted by h: S³ → S². The Hopf map can be defined using quaternions or complex numbers. Here, we will use complex numbers to define the Hopf map.\n\nLet S³ be the unit sphere in ℝ⁴, which can be represented as the set of points (z₁, z₂) in ℂ² such that |z₁|² + |z₂|² = 1. The 2-sphere S² can be represented as the set of points (x, y, z) in ℝ³ such that x² + y² + z² = 1.\n\nThe Hopf map h: S³ → S² can be defined as follows:\n\nh(z₁, z₂) = (2Re(z₁ * conj(z₂)), 2Im(z₁ * conj(z₂)), |z₁|² - |z₂|²)\n\nwhere Re and Im denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively, and conj denotes the complex conjugate.\n\nTo show that this map is well-defined, we need to verify that the image of any point (z₁, z₂) in S³ lies on S². In other words, we need to show that for any (z₁, z₂) in S³, the image h(z₁, z₂) satisfies the equation x² + y² + z² = 1.\n\nLet (x, y, z) = h(z₁, z₂). Then:\n\nx² + y² + z² = (2Re(z₁ * conj(z₂)))² + (2Im(z₁ * conj(z₂)))² + (|z₁|² - |z₂|²)²\n= 4|z₁ * conj(z₂)|² + (|z₁|² - |z₂|²)²\n= 4|z₁|²|z₂|² + |z₁|⁴ - 2|z₁|²|z₂|² + |z₂|⁴\n= |z₁|⁴ + 2|z₁|²|z₂|² + |z₂|⁴\n= (|z₁|² + |z₂|²)²\n= 1²\n= 1\n\nThus, the Hopf map h: S³ → S² is well-defined."
