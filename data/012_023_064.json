    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nEdges: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,5}, {4,6}, {5,6}, {6,7}, {7,8}, {7,9}, {8,9}\n\nWe can see that there is a complete subgraph with 3 vertices: {1, 2, 3}. The edges connecting these vertices are {1,2}, {1,3}, and {2,3}. There is no larger complete subgraph in this graph.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
