    "message_1": "Suppose that $f(z)$ is a meromorphic function on the complex plane that satisfies $\\mathrm{Res}(f,z_n) = a_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $z_n$ are the poles of $f$ with $a_n \\neq 0$. If the residues of $f$ at its simple poles are $b_1,b_2, \\ldots$, calculate the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n^2}$ in terms of $b_1,b_2, \\ldots$.",
    "message_2": "Let $g(z) = \\frac{1}{f(z)}$. Then $g(z)$ is a meromorphic function with zeros at the poles of $f(z)$, and the order of each zero is the same as the order of the corresponding pole of $f(z)$. Moreover, the residue of $g(z)$ at each zero is the reciprocal of the residue of $f(z)$ at the corresponding pole.\n\nNow, consider the function $h(z) = g(z) - \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(z - z_n)^2}$. This function is also meromorphic, and its poles are simple poles with residues $-a_n^2$ at $z_n$. Since the residues of $f(z)$ at its simple poles are $b_1, b_2, \\ldots$, the residues of $g(z)$ at these poles are $\\frac{1}{b_1}, \\frac{1}{b_2}, \\ldots$. Therefore, the residues of $h(z)$ at these poles are $-\\frac{1}{b_1^2}, -\\frac{1}{b_2^2}, \\ldots$.\n\nNow, consider the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n^2}$. We can rewrite this sum as the sum of the residues of $h(z)$ at its simple poles, multiplied by $-1$. That is,\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n^2} = -\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\mathrm{Res}(h, z_n) = -\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(-\\frac{1}{b_n^2}\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{b_n^2}.$$\n\nThus, the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n^2}$ is equal to $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{b_n^2}$."
