    "message_2": "To determine whether the conclusion Q is logically valid based on the given premises, we need to see if we can derive Q from the premises using the rules of relevance logic.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the premises:\n\nP1: (A ∧ B) → C\nThis premise states that if A and B are both true, then C is true.\n\nP2: ¬(B → C) → D\nThis premise states that if it's not the case that B implies C, then D is true.\n\nP3: ¬D ∨ E\nThis premise states that either D is not true, or E is true (or both).\n\nNow, let's try to derive the conclusion Q: A → E\n\n1. Assume A is true.\n2. We want to show that E is true given A.\n3. If A is true, we need to consider the cases when B is true or false.\n4. If B is true, then (A ∧ B) is true, and by P1, C is true.\n5. If C is true, then (B → C) is true.\n6. If (B → C) is true, then ¬(B → C) is false.\n7. If ¬(B → C) is false, then by P2, D is false.\n8. If D is false, then by P3, E must be true.\n9. If B is false, then (B → C) is true (since a false antecedent makes the implication true).\n10. If (B → C) is true, then ¬(B → C) is false.\n11. If ¬(B → C) is false, then by P2, D is false.\n12. If D is false, then by P3, E must be true.\n13. In both cases (B is true or false), we have shown that E is true given A.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion Q: A → E is logically valid based on the given premises."
