    "message_1": "A copper wire has a length of 25 meters and a cross-sectional area of 0.4 mm^2. It carries a current of 5 A and has a resistivity of 1.69 x 10^-8 Ωm. Using the Fourier transform method, determine the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic field at a distance of 10 meters from the wire.",
    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic field at a distance of 10 meters from the wire, we first need to find the magnetic field produced by the wire. We can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field at a distance r from the wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nFor our problem, I = 5 A and r = 10 m. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 10 m)\nB = (2 x 10^-6 T)\n\nNow, we need to use the Fourier transform method to find the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic field. The Fourier transform of the magnetic field B(z) at a distance z from the wire can be written as:\n\nB(k) = ∫ B(z) * e^(-i * k * z) dz\n\nwhere B(k) is the Fourier transform of the magnetic field, k is the wave number, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nHowever, the Fourier transform method is not the most suitable approach for this problem, as it is typically used for analyzing time-varying fields or fields with complex spatial distributions. In this case, we have a simple, static magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying a constant current.\n\nInstead, we can use the Ampere's law to find the magnetic field at a distance r from the wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nWe have already calculated the magnetic field B at a distance of 10 meters from the wire:\n\nB = 2 x 10^-6 T\n\nSince the magnetic field is static and not time-varying, the amplitude of the electromagnetic field is simply the magnitude of the magnetic field:\n\nAmplitude = 2 x 10^-6 T\n\nAs for the phase, since the magnetic field is static and not time-varying, there is no phase associated with it. The phase is only relevant for time-varying fields or fields with complex spatial distributions.\n\nIn conclusion, the amplitude of the electromagnetic field at a distance of 10 meters from the wire is 2 x 10^-6 T, and there is no phase associated with the static magnetic field."
