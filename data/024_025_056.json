    "message_2": "Since $M$ is a complex manifold of complex dimension 2, it has real dimension 4. Chern classes are topological invariants associated with complex vector bundles, and their degrees are determined by the complex dimension of the manifold. In other words, the highest non-zero Chern class of a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$ is $c_n(M)$.\n\nTherefore, for a complex manifold of complex dimension 2, the highest non-zero Chern class is $c_2(M)$. All higher Chern classes, such as $c_3(M), c_4(M),$ and $c_5(M)$, are zero.\n\nSo, we have:\n$c_3(M) = 0$\n$c_4(M) = 0$\n$c_5(M) = 0$"
