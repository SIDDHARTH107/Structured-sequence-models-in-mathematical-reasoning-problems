    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, N = 5 (since it is composed of 5 smaller copies of itself) and s = 3 (since each side of the smaller squares is 1/3 the length of the original square).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with the number of p-steps (iterations). Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the number of p-steps is 4 is still approximately 1.465."
