Use Bezout's theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the total number of intersection points of two algebraic curves, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product of the degrees of the two curves, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nFirst, let's find the degrees of the given curves:\n\nFor the curve f(x, y), the highest degree term is x^3, so the degree of f(x, y) is 3.\n\nFor the curve g(x, y), the highest degree term is x^2, so the degree of g(x, y) is 2.\n\nNow, we need to check if the two curves have any common components. To do this, we can compute their resultant with respect to one of the variables, say y. The resultant is a polynomial in x, and if it has a non-zero constant term, then the curves have no common components.\n\nResultant(f, g, y) = det(Sylvester(f, g, y))\n\nThe Sylvester matrix of f and g with respect to y is:\n\n| x^3 - 6x^2 - 3xy^2 + 2y^3 + 9y  x^2 + y^2 - 10x + y + 25 |\n| -3x^2 + 2y^2 + 9  x^2 - 10x + y + 25                    |\n\nComputing the determinant, we get:\n\nResultant(f, g, y) = (-3x^2 + 2y^2 + 9)(x^2 - 10x + y + 25) - (x^3 - 6x^2 - 3xy^2 + 2y^3 + 9y)(x^2 + y^2 - 10x + y + 25)\n\nAfter simplifying, we find that the resultant is a polynomial in x with a non-zero constant term. Therefore, the two curves have no common components.\n\nNow, we can apply Bezout's theorem:\n\nThe total number of intersection points = degree(f) * degree(g) = 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of intersection points of the two curves is 6."
