    "message_2": "To solve the rational equation, we first find the least common denominator (LCD) of the three fractions, which is the product of the three distinct linear factors: (x-2)(x+3)(x-5). Then, we multiply each term by the LCD to eliminate the denominators:\n\n(3/(x-2)) * (x-2)(x+3)(x-5) - (2/(x+3)) * (x-2)(x+3)(x-5) = (1/(x-5)) * (x-2)(x+3)(x-5)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the denominators:\n\n3(x+3)(x-5) - 2(x-2)(x-5) = (x-2)(x+3)\n\nNext, we expand the expressions:\n\n3(x^2 - 2x - 15) - 2(x^2 - 7x + 10) = x^2 + x - 6\n\nNow, distribute the constants:\n\n3x^2 - 6x - 45 - 2x^2 + 14x - 20 = x^2 + x - 6\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 - 3x - 25 = x^2 + x - 6\n\nSubtract x^2 from both sides:\n\n-3x - 25 = x - 6\n\nAdd 3x to both sides:\n\n-25 = 4x - 6\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\n-19 = 4x\n\nFinally, divide by 4:\n\nx = -19/4\n\nSo, the solution to the rational equation is x = -19/4."
