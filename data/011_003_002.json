    "message_2": "In Pascal's Triangle, the value of an entry in the nth row and kth column can be found using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n! denotes the factorial of n, and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nFor the 7th number in the 6th row, we have n = 6 and k = 7 - 1 = 6 (since Pascal's Triangle starts with row 0 and column 0).\n\nC(6, 6) = 6! / (6! * (6-6)!)\n\nC(6, 6) = 6! / (6! * 0!)\n\nSince 0! = 1, we have:\n\nC(6, 6) = 6! / (6! * 1) = 6! / 6! = 1\n\nSo, the value of the 7th number in the 6th row of Pascal's Triangle is 1."
