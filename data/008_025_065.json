    "message_2": "To show that the given system of linear equations has no solutions, we need to demonstrate that the equations are inconsistent. We can do this by manipulating the equations to show that they lead to a contradiction.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in the first and second equations equal:\n\n4x + 6y - 8z = 10\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the modified first equation:\n\n(4x + 6y - 8z) - (4x - 5y + 9z) = 10 - (-3)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n11y - 17z = 13 (Let's call this equation A)\n\nNext, let's multiply the first equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x in the first and third equations equal:\n\n6x + 9y - 12z = 15\n\nNow, subtract the third equation from the modified first equation:\n\n(6x + 9y - 12z) - (6x + 4y - 7z) = 15 - 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5y - 5z = 13 (Let's call this equation B)\n\nNow, let's multiply equation B by 2.2 to make the coefficients of y in equations A and B equal:\n\n11y - 11z = 28.6\n\nNow, subtract equation A from the modified equation B:\n\n(11y - 11z) - (11y - 17z) = 28.6 - 13\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n6z = 15.6\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6:\n\nz = 2.6\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into equations A and B to find the values of x and y:\n\nEquation A: 11y - 17(2.6) = 13\n11y - 44.2 = 13\n11y = 57.2\ny = 5.2\n\nEquation B: 5y - 5(2.6) = 13\n5(5.2) - 13 = 13\n26 - 13 = 13\n\nNow, substitute the values of y and z back into the first original equation to find the value of x:\n\n2x + 3(5.2) - 4(2.6) = 5\n2x + 15.6 - 10.4 = 5\n2x + 5.2 = 5\n2x = -0.2\nx = -0.1\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z are:\n\nx = -0.1\ny = 5.2\nz = 2.6\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our calculations. When we subtracted equation A from the modified equation B, we should have gotten a contradiction, but we didn't. This means that the system of linear equations actually has a unique solution, not no solutions as stated in the problem.\n\nThe unique solution for the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -0.1\ny = 5.2\nz = 2.6"
