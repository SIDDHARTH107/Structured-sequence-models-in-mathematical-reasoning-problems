    "message_2": "To determine the number of isomorphism classes for groups of order 12, we can use the Sylow theorems and consider the possible structures of the groups.\n\nA group of order 12 has the form p^a * q^b, where p and q are prime numbers, and a and b are positive integers. In this case, we have 12 = 2^2 * 3^1.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. If n_2 = 3, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possible value for n_3 is 1. Therefore, there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the groups:\n\n1. If there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup (of order 4) and the Sylow 3-subgroup (of order 3). Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, there are two possible semi-direct products, corresponding to the two non-isomorphic groups of order 4 (cyclic and Klein-4). These give us the isomorphism classes for the groups C_12 (cyclic group of order 12) and C_3 x C_2 x C_2 (the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 2, and 2).\n\n2. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, then the group is non-abelian. The only non-abelian group of order 12 that has not been considered yet is the alternating group A_4, which has three Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nThus, there are three different isomorphism classes for groups of order 12: C_12, C_3 x C_2 x C_2, and A_4."
