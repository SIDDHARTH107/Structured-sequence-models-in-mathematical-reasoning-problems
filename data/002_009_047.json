    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder that needs to be painted, we need to calculate the lateral surface area and the area of the two circular bases.\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cylinder can be found using the formula: Lateral Surface Area = 2 * π * r * h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nThe area of each circular base can be found using the formula: Base Area = π * r^2.\n\nSince there are two bases, we need to multiply the base area by 2.\n\nLet's calculate the surface area:\n\n1. Lateral Surface Area:\n   LSA = 2 * π * 7 * 12\n   LSA ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 7 * 12\n   LSA ≈ 527.04 cm²\n\n2. Base Area:\n   BA = π * 7^2\n   BA ≈ 3.1416 * 49\n   BA ≈ 153.94 cm²\n\n3. Total Surface Area:\n   TSA = LSA + 2 * BA\n   TSA = 527.04 + 2 * 153.94\n   TSA = 527.04 + 307.88\n   TSA ≈ 834.92 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder that needs to be painted is approximately 834.92 cm²."
