    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate x from the second and third equations by subtracting the first equation multiplied by an appropriate factor.\n\n1. x + 2y + z = 7\n2. 2x + 4y + 3z = 13\n3. 3x + 6y + 4z = 22\n\nSubtract 2 times the first equation from the second equation:\n\n2. (2x - 2*(x)) + (4y - 2*(2y)) + (3z - 2*(z)) = 13 - 2*7\n2. 0x + 0y + z = -1\n\nSubtract 3 times the first equation from the third equation:\n\n3. (3x - 3*(x)) + (6y - 3*(2y)) + (4z - 3*(z)) = 22 - 3*7\n3. 0x + 0y + z = 1\n\nNow we have two equations with the same variables and different constants:\n\n2. z = -1\n3. z = 1\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means the system of linear equations has no solution."
