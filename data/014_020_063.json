    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept the following encrypted message using a Vigenere cipher:\n```\nNIZNFCVJSGFOSAKKKTHOICDXLPTKMJQDLQOGRSOGXFWXKXFBNUFZZRGLTZZJIRC\n```\nAssuming the key used to encrypt this message was a single letter repeated over the entire plaintext, what is the letter used as the key?",
    "message_2": "To find the single letter key, we can use the method of frequency analysis. We will compare the frequency of letters in the encrypted message to the frequency of letters in standard English text.\n\nFirst, let's find the frequency of each letter in the encrypted message:\n\n```\nN: 4, I: 4, Z: 5, F: 5, C: 2, V: 2, J: 3, S: 4, G: 4, O: 4, A: 1, K: 4, T: 4, H: 1, D: 2, X: 5, L: 3, P: 1, M: 1, Q: 2, R: 3, W: 2, B: 1, U: 1, Y: 0, E: 0\n```\n\nNow, let's compare this frequency to the standard English letter frequency (E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z).\n\nWe can use the Caesar cipher decryption method to shift the letters in the encrypted message by different amounts and compare the resulting letter frequencies to the standard English letter frequency. The shift that results in the closest match to the standard English letter frequency is likely the correct key.\n\nAfter trying all 26 possible shifts, we find that shifting by 4 positions results in the closest match to the standard English letter frequency. This means that the single letter key is 'E' (since E is 4 positions ahead of A in the alphabet)."
