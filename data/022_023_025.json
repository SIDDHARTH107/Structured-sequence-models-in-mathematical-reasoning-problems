    "message_2": "To find the relationship between $k$ and $\\omega$, we need to take the second partial derivatives of $f(z)$ with respect to $t$ and $z$ and then plug them into the wave equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = -i\\omega e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial t^2} = (-i\\omega)^2 e^{i(kz - \\omega t)} = -\\omega^2 e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}$\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives with respect to $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = ik e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} = (ik)^2 e^{i(kz - \\omega t)} = -k^2 e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}$\n\nNow, we plug these second partial derivatives into the wave equation:\n\n$-\\omega^2 e^{i(kz - \\omega t)} = c^2(-k^2 e^{i(kz - \\omega t)})$\n\nSince $e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}$ is a common factor on both sides, we can divide both sides by it:\n\n$-\\omega^2 = -c^2 k^2$\n\nNow, we can solve for the relationship between $k$ and $\\omega$:\n\n$\\omega^2 = c^2 k^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n$\\omega = \\pm ck$\n\nSo, the relationship between $k$ and $\\omega$ that satisfies the wave equation is:\n\n$\\omega = \\pm ck$"
