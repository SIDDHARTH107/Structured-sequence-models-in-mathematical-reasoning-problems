    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the cuckoo search algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function f(x) = 3x^2 + 9x + 2.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Number of nests (n) = 10\n- Discovery rate (p_a) = 0.25\n- Maximum iterations (max_iter) = 100\n- Lower and upper bounds for x: -10 and 10\n\nStep 2: Generate initial solutions (nests)\nRandomly generate 10 nests (solutions) within the given bounds.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the fitness of each nest\nCalculate the value of f(x) for each nest and store the results.\n\nStep 4: Perform the cuckoo search\nFor each iteration:\n  1. Choose a random nest and generate a new solution using a random walk (Levy flight).\n  2. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n  3. If the new solution is better than the original nest, replace the original nest with the new solution.\n  4. Randomly choose a fraction (p_a) of the worst nests and replace them with new random solutions.\n  5. Evaluate the fitness of the new nests.\n  6. Update the best solution found so far.\n\nStep 5: Termination\nAfter reaching the maximum number of iterations (max_iter), return the best solution found.\n\nApplying the cuckoo search algorithm to the given function, we can find the minimum value of f(x). However, as this is a metaheuristic algorithm, the solution may not be the exact minimum value, but it will be very close to the true minimum.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = 3x^2 + 9x + 2, the exact minimum value can be found using calculus. By taking the derivative of the function and setting it to zero, we can find the critical points:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 9\n6x + 9 = 0\nx = -1.5\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the original function to find the minimum value:\n\nf(-1.5) = 3(-1.5)^2 + 9(-1.5) + 2 = -8.25\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 9x + 2 is -8.25. The cuckoo search algorithm should give us a result close to this value."
