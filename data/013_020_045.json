    "message_1": "Suppose there are 5 players in a Beauty Contest Game, and each player must choose a number between 1 and 100. The winner of the game is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the chosen numbers. What number should a player choose in order to have the highest chance of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "In the Beauty Contest Game, players are trying to outguess each other, so the optimal strategy involves thinking about what other players might choose and adjusting your choice accordingly. Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n1. If all players choose a number randomly between 1 and 100, the average of those numbers would be around 50.5 (the midpoint of the range).\n2. If all players think this way, they would choose 2/3 of 50.5, which is approximately 33.67.\n3. However, if all players choose around 33.67, the new average would be around 33.67, and 2/3 of that is approximately 22.45.\n4. This process can be repeated, with each iteration leading to a lower number.\n\nIn practice, the optimal strategy is to choose a number slightly below the expected 2/3 of the average, as players tend to overestimate the average. In this case, choosing a number around 20-22 would give you a higher chance of winning the game, as it accounts for the iterative thinking of other players. However, there is no definitive answer, as the outcome depends on the choices of the other players and their thought processes."
