    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga. In this problem, we are asked to find the total number of circles after four iterations, starting with a circle of curvature 1.\n\nLet's denote the number of circles added at each iteration as C_n, where n is the iteration number. For the first iteration (n=1), we add 3 circles (C_1 = 3). For the second iteration (n=2), we add 6 circles to each of the 3 interstices from the first iteration, so C_2 = 3 * 6 = 18. For the third iteration (n=3), we add 6 circles to each of the 18 interstices from the second iteration, so C_3 = 18 * 6 = 108. For the fourth iteration (n=4), we add 6 circles to each of the 108 interstices from the third iteration, so C_4 = 108 * 6 = 648.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of circles after four iterations, including the initial circle. The total number of circles is the sum of the circles added at each iteration plus the initial circle:\n\nTotal circles = Initial circle + C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4\nTotal circles = 1 + 3 + 18 + 108 + 648\nTotal circles = 778\n\nSo, there are 778 circles in the Apollonian gasket after four iterations, starting with a circle of curvature 1."
