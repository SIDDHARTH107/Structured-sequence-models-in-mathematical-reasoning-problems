    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 120 that are not isomorphic to C120 or A5 × C2 × C2, we first need to analyze the prime factorization of 120 and the possible group structures.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 × 3 × 5. Now, we can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 120.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: There are either 1, 3, or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8. If there is only one, it is normal, and the group is a semi-direct product of the form (C8 × C3) ⋊ C5 or (C4 × C2) ⋊ C5. In either case, the group is non-abelian.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: There are either 1 or 10 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. If there is only one, it is normal, and the group is a semi-direct product of the form (C8 × C5) ⋊ C3 or (C4 × C2) ⋊ C3. In either case, the group is non-abelian.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: There is only one Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, and it is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the form (C8 × C3) ⋊ C5 or (C4 × C2) ⋊ C5. In either case, the group is non-abelian.\n\nNow, we need to eliminate the groups isomorphic to C120 and A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nC120 is a cyclic group of order 120, so any group isomorphic to it must be abelian. We are only considering non-abelian groups, so we don't need to worry about this case.\n\nA5 × C2 × C2 is a direct product of the alternating group A5 of order 60 and two cyclic groups of order 2. The order of A5 × C2 × C2 is 60 × 2 × 2 = 120. Since A5 is simple and non-abelian, any group isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2 must have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup. This eliminates the cases where there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nThus, we are left with the following non-abelian groups of order 120:\n\n1. (C8 × C3) ⋊ C5\n2. (C4 × C2) ⋊ C5\n3. (C8 × C5) ⋊ C3\n4. (C4 × C2) ⋊ C3\n\nThese four groups are not isomorphic to C120 or A5 × C2 × C2. Therefore, there are 4 non-abelian groups of order 120 that are not isomorphic to C120 or A5 × C2 × C2."
