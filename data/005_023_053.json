    "message_1": "Suppose that a small manufacturing company produces widgets, and the hourly wage of its employees is normally distributed with a mean of $15 per hour and a standard deviation of $2 per hour. However, after conducting a salary review, the company found that one of its employees was paid $30 per hour for a total of 360 hours worked during the year. Is this employee considered an outlier at a significance level of 5%?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the employee is an outlier at a significance level of 5%, we will use the Z-score formula:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the employee's hourly wage, μ is the mean hourly wage, and σ is the standard deviation of the hourly wage.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the Z-score for the employee:\n\nZ = ($30 - $15) / $2 = $15 / $2 = 7.5\n\nNow, we will compare the Z-score to the critical Z-value for a significance level of 5%. Since we are looking for outliers on both ends of the distribution, we will use a two-tailed test. The critical Z-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level is approximately ±1.96.\n\nSince the Z-score of 7.5 is greater than the critical Z-value of 1.96, the employee's hourly wage of $30 per hour is considered an outlier at a significance level of 5%."
