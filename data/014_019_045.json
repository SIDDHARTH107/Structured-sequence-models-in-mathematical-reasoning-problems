    "message_1": "A transposition cipher encrypts a message by rearranging the order of the letters. If a message \"MATHEMATICS\" is encrypted using a transposition key as \"MTACIHSEMATA\", what is the length of the transposition key used?",
    "message_2": "To determine the length of the transposition key, we need to find the pattern in which the letters were rearranged. Let's compare the original message \"MATHEMATICS\" with the encrypted message \"MTACIHSEMATA\":\n\nOriginal:  M A T H E M A T I C S\nEncrypted: M T A C I H S E M A T A\n\nWe can see that the letters are rearranged in a pattern. Let's try to find the pattern by dividing the original message into equal parts:\n\nM A T | H E M | A T I | C S\n\nNow, let's rearrange the parts of the original message to match the encrypted message:\n\nM A T | A T I | H E M | C S\n\nNow, if we read the letters in the rearranged parts, we get the encrypted message:\n\nMTAC | IHSE | MATA\n\nFrom this, we can see that the transposition key has a length of 3, as the original message was divided into 3-letter parts before rearranging."
