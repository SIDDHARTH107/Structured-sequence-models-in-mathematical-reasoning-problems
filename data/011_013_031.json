    "message_1": "A student has to form a necklace with 12 beads, but only has access to 3 black beads and 9 white beads. How many distinct necklaces can be made?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Burnside's Lemma, which is a method used in combinatorics to count the number of orbits in a group action.\n\nLet's consider the group action of rotating the necklace. There are 12 possible rotations (including the identity rotation, which leaves the necklace unchanged). We will count the number of fixed points for each rotation and then average them to find the number of distinct necklaces.\n\n1. Identity rotation (0°): All 12 beads are fixed. There are C(12, 3) = 220 ways to place the 3 black beads among the 12 positions.\n\n2. 30° rotation (1/12 of a full rotation): No beads are fixed, as each bead moves to a new position.\n\n3. 60° rotation (1/6 of a full rotation): No beads are fixed, as each bead moves to a new position.\n\n4. 90° rotation (1/4 of a full rotation): No beads are fixed, as each bead moves to a new position.\n\n5. 120° rotation (1/3 of a full rotation): 4 beads are fixed. To have a fixed point, we need a black bead every 3 positions. There are 4 ways to do this: BWBWBWBWWW, WBWBWBWBBW, BWWBWBWBWB, and BBWWBWBWBW.\n\n6. 150° rotation (5/12 of a full rotation): No beads are fixed, as each bead moves to a new position.\n\n7. 180° rotation (1/2 of a full rotation): 6 beads are fixed. To have a fixed point, we need a black bead every 2 positions. There are 2 ways to do this: BBWBWBWBWB and WBWBWBWBWW.\n\n8. 210° rotation (7/12 of a full rotation): No beads are fixed, as each bead moves to a new position.\n\n9. 240° rotation (2/3 of a full rotation): Same as the 120° rotation, there are 4 ways.\n\n10. 270° rotation (3/4 of a full rotation): No beads are fixed, as each bead moves to a new position.\n\n11. 300° rotation (5/6 of a full rotation): No beads are fixed, as each bead moves to a new position.\n\n12. 330° rotation (11/12 of a full rotation): No beads are fixed, as each bead moves to a new position.\n\nNow, we sum the number of fixed points for each rotation and divide by the total number of rotations:\n\n(220 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 12 = 230 / 12 = 19.1667\n\nSince the number of distinct necklaces must be an integer, we round down to get 19 distinct necklaces that can be made with 3 black beads and 9 white beads."
