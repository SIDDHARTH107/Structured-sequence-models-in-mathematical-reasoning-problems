    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 12345 is divided by 7 using modular arithmetic, we can break down the number into smaller parts and find their remainders when divided by 7. Then, we can combine these remainders to find the overall remainder.\n\n12345 can be written as (1 × 10^4) + (2 × 10^3) + (3 × 10^2) + (4 × 10^1) + (5 × 10^0).\n\nNow, let's find the remainders of each part when divided by 7:\n\n1 × 10^4 ≡ 1 × (10^4 % 7) ≡ 1 × (10000 % 7) ≡ 1 × 1 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2 × 10^3 ≡ 2 × (10^3 % 7) ≡ 2 × (1000 % 7) ≡ 2 × 6 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n3 × 10^2 ≡ 3 × (10^2 % 7) ≡ 3 × (100 % 7) ≡ 3 × 2 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n4 × 10^1 ≡ 4 × (10^1 % 7) ≡ 4 × (10 % 7) ≡ 4 × 3 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n5 × 10^0 ≡ 5 × (10^0 % 7) ≡ 5 × (1 % 7) ≡ 5 × 1 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nNow, let's add these remainders together:\n\n1 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 5 ≡ 22 (mod 7)\n\nFinally, let's find the remainder when 22 is divided by 7:\n\n22 % 7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the remainder when 12345 is divided by 7 is 1."
