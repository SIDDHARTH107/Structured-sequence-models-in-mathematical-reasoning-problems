    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the height of a building located 50 meters away from them. They measure the angle of elevation to the top of the building to be 60 degrees. Using trigonometry, what is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, we have:\n\ntan(angle) = (height of the building) / (distance from the building)\n\nWe are given the angle of elevation (60 degrees) and the distance from the building (50 meters). We can plug these values into the equation:\n\ntan(60) = (height of the building) / 50\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3, so:\n\n√3 = (height of the building) / 50\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the building:\n\nheight of the building = 50 * √3\n\nheight of the building ≈ 50 * 1.732\n\nheight of the building ≈ 86.6 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 86.6 meters."
