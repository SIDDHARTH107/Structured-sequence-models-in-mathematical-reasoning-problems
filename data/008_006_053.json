    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the matrix A. The characteristic equation is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[3 - λ, 1], [1, 3 - λ]]\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\n|A - λI| = (3 - λ)(3 - λ) - (1)(1)\n|A - λI| = λ^2 - 6λ + 8\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we set the determinant equal to zero and solve for λ:\n\nλ^2 - 6λ + 8 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored as (λ - 2)(λ - 4) = 0. Thus, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 4.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([[1, 1], [1, 1]])v1 = 0\n\nWe can see that the eigenvector v1 can be any scalar multiple of [1, -1]. So, we can choose v1 = [1, -1] as one of the eigenvectors.\n\nFor λ2 = 4:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([[-1, 1], [1, -1]])v2 = 0\n\nWe can see that the eigenvector v2 can be any scalar multiple of [1, 1]. So, we can choose v2 = [1, 1] as the other eigenvector.\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 4, with corresponding eigenvectors v1 = [1, -1] and v2 = [1, 1]."
