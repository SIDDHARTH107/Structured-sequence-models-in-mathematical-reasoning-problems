    "message_2": "The divisibility rule of 9 states that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the number 15439:\n\n1 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 9 = 22\n\nSince 22 is not divisible by 9, we need to find the remainder when 15439 is divided by 9.\n\nTo do this, we can find the closest multiple of 9 to 22, which is 18 (9 * 2 = 18). Now, we subtract 18 from 22:\n\n22 - 18 = 4\n\nSo, the remainder when 15439 is divided by 9 is 4."
