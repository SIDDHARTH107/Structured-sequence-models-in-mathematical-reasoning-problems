    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors u and v, we can use the formula:\n\nw = u × v\n\nThe components of the cross product w can be found using the following determinants:\n\nw_x = (u_y * v_z) - (u_z * v_y)\nw_y = (u_z * v_x) - (u_x * v_z)\nw_z = (u_x * v_y) - (u_y * v_x)\n\nUsing the given vectors u = (3, 2, 1) and v = (-1, 4, 2), we can calculate the components of the cross product w:\n\nw_x = (2 * 2) - (1 * 4) = 4 - 4 = 0\nw_y = (1 * -1) - (3 * 2) = -1 - 6 = -7\nw_z = (3 * 4) - (2 * -1) = 12 + 2 = 14\n\nSo, the cross product w = (0, -7, 14).\n\nNow, to find the magnitude of the resulting vector w, we can use the formula:\n\n|w| = √(w_x^2 + w_y^2 + w_z^2)\n\n|w| = √(0^2 + (-7)^2 + 14^2) = √(49 + 196) = √245\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the resulting vector is √245."
