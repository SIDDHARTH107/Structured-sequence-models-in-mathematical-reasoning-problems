    "message_2": "To solve the equation (5x - 2) / (2x + 1) = 3/4, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(5x - 2) * 4 = (2x + 1) * 3\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n20x - 8 = 6x + 3\n\nNext, isolate the x terms by subtracting 6x from both sides:\n\n14x - 8 = 3\n\nNow, isolate the x term by adding 8 to both sides:\n\n14x = 11\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 14 to solve for x:\n\nx = 11/14"
