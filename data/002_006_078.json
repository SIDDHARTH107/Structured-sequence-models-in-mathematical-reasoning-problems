    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π × Diameter (D)\n\nGiven the diameter (D) is 10 meters, we can plug it into the formula:\n\nC = π × 10\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 × 10\n\nC ≈ 31.4159 meters\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 31.4159 meters."
