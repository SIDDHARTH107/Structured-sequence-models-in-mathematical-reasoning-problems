Implication Introduction (→I): If we can derive B from A, then we can conclude A → B.\n\nWe will proceed with a proof by assuming (p → q) ∧ (q → r) and p, and then show that r follows.\n\nProof:\n\n1. Assume (p → q) ∧ (q → r) (Assumption)\n2. p → q (1, ∧-elimination)\n3. q → r (1, ∧-elimination)\n4. Assume p (Assumption)\n5. q (2, 4, MP)\n6. r (3, 5, MP)\n7. p → r (4-6, →I)\n8. (p → q) ∧ (q → r) → (p → r) (1-7, →I)\n\nThus, using intuitionistic logic, we have proven that (p → q) ∧ (q → r) → (p → r) for any propositions p, q, and r."
