    "message_2": "To find the possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups in a group of order 36, we use Sylow's Theorem. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in the group. The order of the group is 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. According to Sylow's Theorem:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of the group without the highest power of 3, which is 2^2 = 4. So, n_3 divides 4.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe possible divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. The only one that satisfies the second condition is n_3 = 1. Therefore, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup in a group of order 36.\n\nNow, let's find the number of non-abelian groups of order 36. There are a total of 4 groups of order 36:\n\n1. C_36 (cyclic group)\n2. C_2 x C_18\n3. C_6 x C_6\n4. A non-abelian group\n\nThe first three groups are abelian, so there is only one non-abelian group of order 36."
