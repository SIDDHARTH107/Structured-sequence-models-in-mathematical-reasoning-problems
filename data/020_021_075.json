    "message_1": "A factory has to produce two types of products, A and B. The factory has 100 machines and a limited amount of raw materials. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of raw materials, while each unit of product B requires 2 hours of machine time and 1 hour of raw materials. The profit for each unit of A and B is $10 and $7, respectively. The factory wants to maximize its profit. What is the maximum profit the factory can earn and how many units of each product should the factory produce to achieve this?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and raw materials can be represented as follows:\n\nMachine time: 3x + 2y ≤ 100 * T (where T is the total number of hours the machines are available)\nRaw materials: 2x + y ≤ R (where R is the total number of hours of raw materials available)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 7y\n\nTo find the maximum profit and the number of units of each product, we need to know the values of T and R. Please provide the total number of hours the machines are available (T) and the total number of hours of raw materials available (R)."
