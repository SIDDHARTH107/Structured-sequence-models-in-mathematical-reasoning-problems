    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 centimeters. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (7^2) = 4 * π * 49 = 196π\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 615.75 square centimeters."
