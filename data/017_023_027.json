    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Determine the number of possible divisors for each prime factor: For 2, there are 1, 2, and 3 divisors; for 3, there are 1 and 2 divisors.\n3. Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order: G(p^a * q^b) = (p^(a-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(b-1) * (q-1)), where p and q are prime factors, and a and b are their respective exponents in the prime factorization.\n4. Calculate the number of groups for each combination of divisors: G(2^3 * 3^2) = (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(2-1) * (3-1)) = (2^2 * 1) * (3^1 * 2) = 4 * 6 = 24\n5. Subtract the number of isomorphic groups: In this case, there are no isomorphic groups, so the total number of non-isomorphic groups remains 24.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
