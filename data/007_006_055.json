    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 252 and 198 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (252) by the smaller number (198) and find the remainder.\n   252 รท 198 = 1 with a remainder of 54.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (252) with the smaller number (198) and the smaller number with the remainder (54) from the previous step.\n   Now we have 198 and 54.\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n   198 รท 54 = 3 with a remainder of 36.\n   Replace 198 with 54 and 54 with 36. Now we have 54 and 36.\n   54 รท 36 = 1 with a remainder of 18.\n   Replace 54 with 36 and 36 with 18. Now we have 36 and 18.\n   36 รท 18 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 18.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 198 is 18."
