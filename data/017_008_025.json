    "message_2": "To prove that G must be isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will first show that G must have an element of order 2, then we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the number of elements of order 2, and finally, we will show that these structures correspond to the Cayley tables of C8, Q8, and D4.\n\nStep 1: G must have an element of order 2.\nBy the Cauchy's theorem, since the order of G is 8, which is divisible by 2, there must exist an element of order 2 in G. Let's denote this element as x.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the possible structures of G based on the number of elements of order 2.\nThere are three possible cases for the number of elements of order 2 in G:\n\nCase 1: G has exactly one element of order 2.\nIn this case, G must be a cyclic group generated by an element of order 8. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nCase 2: G has exactly three elements of order 2.\nLet's denote these elements as x, y, and z. Since the identity element e has order 1, we have 4 elements in G: e, x, y, and z. The remaining 4 elements must have order 4, as they cannot have order 1 or 2. Let's denote these elements as a, b, c, and d. Since the product of two elements of order 4 must be an element of order 2, we can fill in the Cayley table of G as follows:\n\n```\n  e x y z a b c d\ne e x y z a b c d\nx x e z y d c a b\ny y z e x c d b a\nz z y x e b a d c\na a d c b x y z e\nb b c d a y z e x\nc c b a d z e x y\nd d a b c e x y z\n```\n\nThis Cayley table corresponds to the dihedral group D4, so G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nCase 3: G has exactly five elements of order 2.\nLet's denote these elements as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. Since the identity element e has order 1, we have 6 elements in G: e, x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. The remaining 2 elements must have order 4, as they cannot have order 1 or 2. Let's denote these elements as a and b. We can fill in the Cayley table of G as follows:\n\n```\n  e x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 a b\ne e x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 a b\nx1 x1 e x3 x2 x5 x4 b a\nx2 x2 x3 e x1 x4 x5 a b\nx3 x3 x2 x1 e x5 x4 b a\nx4 x4 x5 x5 e x1 x2 a b\nx5 x5 x4 x4 x2 e x1 b a\na a b x5 x4 x3 e x1 x2\nb b a x4 x5 x2 x3 x1 e\n```\n\nThis Cayley table corresponds to the quaternion group Q8, so G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the number of elements of order 2 in G, we have shown that G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4 using the Cayley table of G."
