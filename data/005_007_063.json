    "message_1": "A math student is analyzing the correlation between the number of hours spent studying and the exam scores in a statistics class. After collecting data from 20 students, the student obtains the following correlation coefficient: r = 0.75. What is the coefficient of determination for this correlation?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation coefficient (r). In this case, r = 0.75. To find the coefficient of determination, simply square the value of r:\n\nCoefficient of determination = r^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625\n\nSo, the coefficient of determination is 0.5625. This means that 56.25% of the variation in exam scores can be explained by the variation in the number of hours spent studying."
