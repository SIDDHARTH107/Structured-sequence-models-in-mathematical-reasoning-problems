    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we first need to find the possible factorizations of 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we can find the number of groups of order 72.\n\nThe formula is given by:\n\nn(G) = (p^(a-1) * (p^a - 1)) * (q^(b-1) * (q^b - 1))\n\nwhere G is the group of order 72, p and q are prime factors, and a and b are the exponents of the prime factors in the factorization.\n\nFor our case, p = 2, a = 3, q = 3, and b = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nn(G) = (2^(3-1) * (2^3 - 1)) * (3^(2-1) * (3^2 - 1))\nn(G) = (2^2 * 7) * (3^1 * 8)\nn(G) = (4 * 7) * (3 * 8)\nn(G) = 28 * 24\nn(G) = 672\n\nHowever, this formula gives us the total number of groups of order 72, including isomorphic groups. To find the number of non-isomorphic groups, we need to use the Sylow theorems.\n\nUsing the Sylow theorems, we can find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups is given by the formula:\n\nn_2 = 1 + 2k, where k is an integer and n_2 divides 3^2 = 9.\n\nThe possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nThe number of Sylow 3-subgroups is given by the formula:\n\nn_3 = 1 + 3k, where k is an integer and n_3 divides 2^3 = 8.\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 8.\n\nUsing these values, we can find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, there is only one group, which is the abelian group Z_72.\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, there are two non-isomorphic groups: Z_9 ⋊ Z_8 and Z_9 ⋊ (Z_2 × Z_4).\n3. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, there is only one group, which is the abelian group Z_8 × Z_9.\n4. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4, there are three non-isomorphic groups: (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_8, (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ (Z_2 × Z_4), and (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ D_8.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 72.\n\nThe non-abelian groups of order 72 and their isomorphism types are:\n\n1. Z_9 ⋊ Z_8\n2. Z_9 ⋊ (Z_2 × Z_4)\n3. (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_8\n4. (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ (Z_2 × Z_4)\n5. (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ D_8"
