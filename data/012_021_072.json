    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and the tree satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nWe can construct a tree decomposition for the given graph as follows:\n\n```\n      {1,2,3}\n     /       \\\n  {1,2,4}   {1,3,6}\n  /           /   \\\n{2,4,7}   {3,6,8} {3,6,9}\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the width of this tree decomposition. The width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1.\n\nIn our tree decomposition, the largest bag contains 3 vertices, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
