    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the shadow (adjacent side) is 18 feet, and we want to find the height of the flagpole (opposite side).\n\nThe formula for tangent is:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nWe can plug in the values we know:\n\ntan(30 degrees) = height of flagpole / 18 feet\n\nTo find the height of the flagpole, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 18 feet:\n\nheight of flagpole = 18 feet * tan(30 degrees)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30 degrees) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can multiply this value by 18 feet:\n\nheight of flagpole ≈ 18 feet * 0.577 ≈ 10.386 feet\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 10.39 feet."
