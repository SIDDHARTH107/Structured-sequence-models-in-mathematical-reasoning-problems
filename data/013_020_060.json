    "message_1": "Here is a possible question for a math student:\n\nConsider a Beauty Contest Game where there are five players who need to choose a number between 0 and 100. The player whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all the chosen numbers wins the game. What would be a good strategy for each player, and what number should each player choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "In the Beauty Contest Game, the key is to think about what other players might choose and then base your choice on that. This game involves a degree of strategic thinking and iterative reasoning. Let's analyze the game step by step.\n\n1. If all players choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average would be around 50. So, in this case, a player should choose two-thirds of 50, which is approximately 33.\n\n2. However, if all players think like this and choose 33, the new average would be 33. In this case, a player should choose two-thirds of 33, which is approximately 22.\n\n3. If all players choose 22, the new average would be 22. In this case, a player should choose two-thirds of 22, which is approximately 15.\n\nAs we can see, the chosen numbers are getting smaller with each iteration. This process will continue until the numbers converge to a value. In this game, the numbers will converge to 0.\n\nSo, the best strategy for each player would be to choose a number close to 0. However, since the game involves human players, it's essential to consider that not everyone will follow this logic. Therefore, a good strategy would be to choose a number slightly above 0, like 1 or 2, to account for the possibility that other players might not choose numbers close to 0. This way, you can maximize your chances of winning by being closer to two-thirds of the average if other players choose higher numbers."
