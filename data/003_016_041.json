    "message_2": "To find the equation of the sinusoidal function, we need to determine the values of the amplitude (A), period (T), and phase shift (φ). We are given the following information:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 4\nPeriod (T) = 6π\nPhase shift (φ) = π/2\n\nThe general equation for a sinusoidal function is:\n\ny = A * sin(B(x - φ))\n\nWhere A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase shift. The angular frequency (B) can be found using the formula:\n\nB = 2π / T\n\nSince the period (T) is 6π, we can find the angular frequency (B):\n\nB = 2π / 6π = 1/3\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of A, B, and φ into the general equation:\n\ny = 4 * sin((1/3)(x - π/2))\n\nSo, the equation of the sinusoidal function is:\n\ny = 4 * sin((1/3)(x - π/2))"
