    "message_1": "A flagpole stands on a flat ground, 25 meters away from a person standing on the ground. The top of the pole is at an angle of elevation of 75 degrees. Find the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the flagpole) to the adjacent side (distance from the person to the flagpole).\n\nLet h be the height of the flagpole. We have:\n\ntan(75°) = h / 25\n\nTo find h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 25:\n\nh = 25 * tan(75°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of tan(75°):\n\ntan(75°) ≈ 3.732\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the equation:\n\nh ≈ 25 * 3.732\n\nh ≈ 93.3\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 93.3 meters."
