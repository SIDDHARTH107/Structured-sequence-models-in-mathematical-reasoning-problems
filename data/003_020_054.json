    "message_1": "A ladder leaning against a wall forms a 60° angle with the ground. If the bottom of the ladder is 4 meters away from the wall, how long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function for cosine. In this case, we have a right triangle with a 60° angle, and we know the adjacent side (the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall) is 4 meters. We want to find the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder).\n\nCosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse:\n\ncos(60°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\ncos(60°) = 4 / hypotenuse\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5 (since cos(60°) = 0.5)\n\n0.5 = 4 / hypotenuse\n\nNow, we can solve for the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder):\n\nhypotenuse = 4 / 0.5\n\nhypotenuse = 8 meters\n\nSo, the ladder is 8 meters long."
