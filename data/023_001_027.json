    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 3x, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients. To find b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx, where the integral is taken over the interval -π to π.\n\nNow, let's find b_n for f(x) = 3x:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] (3x * sin(n * x)) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 3x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = 3 dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(3x * (-1/n) * cos(n * x))|(-π to π) - ∫[-π to π] (-1/n) * cos(n * x) * 3 dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-3/n) * (π * cos(n * π) - (-π * cos(-n * π))) - (-3/n) * ∫[-π to π] cos(n * x) dx]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n and cos(-n * π) = (-1)^n, the first term becomes:\n\n(-3/n) * (π * (-1)^n - (-π * (-1)^n)) = 0\n\nNow, let's solve the integral of the second term:\n\n∫[-π to π] cos(n * x) dx = (1/n) * sin(n * x)|(-π to π) = (1/n) * (sin(n * π) - sin(-n * π))\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 and sin(-n * π) = 0, the integral is also 0.\n\nSo, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nThus, the Fourier series of f(x) = 3x is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [0 * cos(n * x) + 0 * sin(n * x)] = 0\n\nThis result may seem counterintuitive, but it's important to note that the Fourier series converges to the function f(x) = 3x only at points where the function is continuous. Since f(x) = 3x is discontinuous at x = ±π, the Fourier series converges to the average value of the function at these points, which is 0."
