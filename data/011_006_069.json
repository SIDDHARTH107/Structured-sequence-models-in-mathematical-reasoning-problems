    "message_1": "Consider a group of 7 people. How many ways can they be seated in a row if there are 3 women and 4 men, and the women must sit together?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can treat the group of 3 women as a single unit, since they must sit together. So now we have 5 units to arrange: the group of 3 women (W) and the 4 individual men (M1, M2, M3, M4).\n\nThere are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange these 5 units:\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 ways\n\nNow, within the group of 3 women, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange them:\n\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways\n\nTo find the total number of ways to seat the 7 people with the given conditions, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 5 units by the number of ways to arrange the women within their group:\n\nTotal ways = (ways to arrange 5 units) × (ways to arrange women within their group)\nTotal ways = 120 × 6\nTotal ways = 720\n\nSo there are 720 ways to seat the 7 people with the given conditions."
