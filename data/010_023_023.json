    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem:\n\nTake a closed loop made of a flexible wire with a length of 20 cm. You want to create a knot in the loop that cannot be undone without cutting the wire. What is the minimum number of times the wire must cross itself to create a knot that satisfies this condition? Use knowledge from the subtopic of Geometric Topology and Knot Theory to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "In knot theory, the simplest nontrivial knot is the trefoil knot. The trefoil knot is the knot that can be formed by joining the two loose ends of an overhand knot, resulting in a closed loop. It is the simplest knot because it has the minimum number of crossings, which is 3. \n\nSo, the minimum number of times the wire must cross itself to create a knot that cannot be undone without cutting the wire is 3."
