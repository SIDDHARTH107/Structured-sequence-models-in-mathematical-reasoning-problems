    "message_2": "To find the smallest value of \"c\" for which the Mandelbrot sequence diverges, we need to consider the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers \"c\" for which the sequence neither converges nor diverges.\n\nThe simplest case is when c is a real number. If c > 1/4, the sequence will diverge, as |z(n)| will become unbounded as n approaches infinity. To see this, let's consider the first few iterations of the sequence:\n\nz(1) = 0^2 + c = c\nz(2) = c^2 + c\n\nIf c > 1/4, then z(2) > c, and the sequence will grow without bound. Therefore, the smallest value of \"c\" for which the Mandelbrot sequence diverges is c = 1/4."
