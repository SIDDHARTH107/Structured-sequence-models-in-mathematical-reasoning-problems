    "message_1": "A hospital wants to study the survival time (in months) of patients who undergo a particular surgery. Out of a total of 50 patients, only 35 are still alive at the end of the study. The hospital records the survival time (in months) of these 35 patients as follows:  5, 8, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 41, 42, 45, 48, 49, 50, 56, 67, 72.\n\nUsing this data, calculate the following:\n- The median survival time of the patients\n- The probability that a randomly selected patient from this group will survive at least 2 years (24 months)\n- The interquartile range (IQR) of the survival times in this group.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the median survival time, we first need to find the middle value of the dataset. Since there are 35 patients, the middle value will be the 18th value when the data is sorted in ascending order. The data is already sorted, so the median survival time is 27 months.\n\nTo calculate the probability that a randomly selected patient from this group will survive at least 2 years (24 months), we need to count the number of patients who survived at least 24 months and divide it by the total number of patients in the group. There are 20 patients who survived at least 24 months, so the probability is 20/35 = 0.5714, or 57.14%.\n\nTo calculate the interquartile range (IQR), we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) and then subtract Q1 from Q3. The first quartile is the median of the lower half of the data, and the third quartile is the median of the upper half of the data. Since there are 35 patients, the lower half consists of the first 17 values, and the upper half consists of the last 17 values.\n\nQ1 (first quartile) is the median of the lower half: (11 + 12) / 2 = 11.5\nQ3 (third quartile) is the median of the upper half: (41 + 42) / 2 = 41.5\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 41.5 - 11.5 = 30\n\nSo, the median survival time is 27 months, the probability of surviving at least 2 years is 57.14%, and the interquartile range is 30 months."
