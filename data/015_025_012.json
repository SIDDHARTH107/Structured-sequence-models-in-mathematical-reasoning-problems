    "message_1": "Given a forced van der Pol oscillator described by the equation:\n\nx''+ ε(x^2 - 1)x' + x = Acos(ωt)\n\nwhere ε = 0.1, A = 1, ω = 1.05 and the initial conditions are x(0) = 0.1 and x'(0) = 0. What is the amplitude of the steady-state response of the oscillator?",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the steady-state response of the forced van der Pol oscillator, we first need to find the particular solution of the given equation. The particular solution can be assumed in the form:\n\nx_p(t) = Xcos(ωt - δ)\n\nwhere X is the amplitude and δ is the phase shift. Now, we need to find the first and second derivatives of x_p(t) with respect to time t:\n\nx_p'(t) = -Xωsin(ωt - δ)\nx_p''(t) = -Xω^2cos(ωt - δ)\n\nNow, substitute x_p(t), x_p'(t), and x_p''(t) into the given equation:\n\n-xω^2cos(ωt - δ) + ε((Xcos(ωt - δ))^2 - 1)(-Xωsin(ωt - δ)) + Xcos(ωt - δ) = Acos(ωt)\n\nNow, equate the coefficients of cos(ωt) and sin(ωt):\n\n-Xω^2 + ε(X^2 - 1)(-Xω) + X = A (1)\nε(X^2 - 1)(-Xω) = 0 (2)\n\nFrom equation (2), we have:\n\nε(X^2 - 1)(-Xω) = 0\n\nSince ε and ω are non-zero, we have:\n\nX^2 - 1 = 0\nX^2 = 1\nX = ±1\n\nNow, substituting X = 1 in equation (1):\n\n-ω^2 + ε(1 - 1)(-ω) + 1 = A\nA = 1 - ω^2\n\nSubstituting ω = 1.05:\n\nA = 1 - (1.05)^2\nA ≈ -0.1025\n\nSince the amplitude cannot be negative, we consider X = -1:\n\nA = ω^2 - 1\nA = (1.05)^2 - 1\nA ≈ 0.1025\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the steady-state response of the forced van der Pol oscillator is approximately 0.1025."
