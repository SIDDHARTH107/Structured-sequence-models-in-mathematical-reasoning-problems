    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure and its maximum degree (the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex).\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the graph with 7 vertices would require 7 colors, as each vertex would be adjacent to all the other vertices.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not complete, the minimum number of colors required could be less than 7. For example, if the graph is a tree (a connected graph with no cycles), the minimum number of colors required would be 2.\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact minimum number of colors required."
