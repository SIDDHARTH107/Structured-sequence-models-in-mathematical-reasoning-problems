    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Calculate the number of possible abelian groups: This can be done using the formula (p^(n+1) - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime factor, where p is the prime factor and n is its exponent. Then multiply the results for each prime factor.\n\nFor 2^3: (2^(3+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = (16 - 1)/1 = 15\nFor 3^2: (3^(2+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (27 - 1)/2 = 13\n\nMultiply the results: 15 * 13 = 195 possible abelian groups.\n\n3. Calculate the number of non-abelian groups: This can be done using the formula (n - a)/2, where n is the total number of groups and a is the number of abelian groups.\n\nThe total number of groups of order 72 can be found using the formula: gcd(72, φ(72)), where φ is Euler's totient function. φ(72) = φ(2^3) * φ(3^2) = 24 * 6 = 144. gcd(72, 144) = 72.\n\nThe number of non-abelian groups is (72 - 195)/2 = -123/2, which is not possible since the number of groups must be a non-negative integer.\n\nTherefore, there are no non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\n4. Combine the results: The total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72 is the sum of the number of abelian and non-abelian groups, which is 195 + 0 = 195."
