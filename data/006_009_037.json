    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain medical condition occurring is 0.05. If 200 people are tested, what is the probability that at least 10 will have this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this case, n = 200 (number of people tested), p = 0.05 (probability of having the medical condition), and we want to find the probability of at least 10 people having the medical condition, i.e., P(X ≥ 10).\n\nTo find P(X ≥ 10), we can use the complement rule, which states that P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10). So, we need to find the probability of having fewer than 10 people with the medical condition, i.e., P(X < 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9).\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ [C(200, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(200-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.5834\n\nNow, we can find P(X ≥ 10) using the complement rule:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.5834 ≈ 0.4166\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 people out of 200 will have the medical condition is approximately 0.4166 or 41.66%."
