    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, so n_3 divides 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe possible values of n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal in G. If n_3 = 3, then there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, and it is not guaranteed that any of them are normal in G.\n\nLet P be a 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. The only possible groups of order 9 are C9 (cyclic group of order 9) and C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). However, C3 × C3 has an element of order 3, while every non-identity element of C9 has order 9. Thus, P must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of 3-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. If n_3 = 1, then the single 3-Sylow subgroup is normal in G, and G is a semi-direct product of P with a group of order 3. Since P is abelian, this semi-direct product is actually a direct product, and G is isomorphic to C9 × C3, which is isomorphic to C27 (cyclic group of order 27).\n\nIf n_3 = 3, then there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, and the action of G on these subgroups is non-trivial. However, this contradicts the fact that P is normal in G, as it is the kernel of the homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S3 induced by the action of G on the 3-Sylow subgroups.\n\nTherefore, we must have n_3 = 1, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27."
