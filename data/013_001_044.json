    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student on the topic of Prisoner's Dilemma:\n\nSuppose two suspects, A and B, are arrested for a crime and are held in separate cells. The prosecutor offers each prisoner a plea bargain: if one testifies against the other and the other remains silent, the one who testifies will go free while the other will be sentenced to 10 years in prison. If both remain silent, they will each serve a sentence of only 1 year. However, if both confess, they will each be sentenced to 5 years in prison.\n\nWhat is the best strategy for each prisoner to minimize their sentence? If both prisoners follow the optimal strategy, what will be the outcome?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for each prisoner, we can analyze the possible outcomes using a payoff matrix:\n\n```\n               Prisoner B\n               Silent     Confess\nPrisoner A\nSilent        -1, -1      0, -10\nConfess       -10, 0      -5, -5\n```\n\nThe numbers in each cell represent the years in prison for Prisoner A and Prisoner B, respectively. For example, if both prisoners remain silent, they each serve 1 year in prison (-1, -1).\n\nThe best strategy for each prisoner is to minimize their sentence, regardless of the other prisoner's choice. This is known as the Nash equilibrium. In this case, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both prisoners confess. Here's why:\n\n- If Prisoner A believes Prisoner B will remain silent, A's best choice is to confess (0 years in prison instead of 1).\n- If Prisoner A believes Prisoner B will confess, A's best choice is also to confess (5 years in prison instead of 10).\n\nThe same logic applies to Prisoner B. Thus, the optimal strategy for both prisoners is to confess.\n\nIf both prisoners follow the optimal strategy, the outcome will be that both confess and each serves 5 years in prison (-5, -5)."
