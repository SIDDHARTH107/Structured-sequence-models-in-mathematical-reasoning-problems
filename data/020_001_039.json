    "message_1": "A furniture company produces chairs and tables. The company has 180 hours of carpentry worktime, 110 hours of sanding worktime, and 220 hours of painting worktime. It takes 6 hours to produce a chair and 8 hours to produce a table. The profit per chair is $30 and the profit per table is $20. Determine the number of chairs and tables the company should produce in order to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nWe are given the following constraints:\n\n1. Carpentry worktime: 6x + 8y ≤ 180\n2. Sanding worktime: x + y ≤ 110\n3. Painting worktime: 2x + 4y ≤ 220\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 30x + 20y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the inequality constraints to find the feasible region:\n\n1. 6x + 8y ≤ 180\n   Divide by 2: 3x + 4y ≤ 90\n   y ≤ (90 - 3x) / 4\n\n2. x + y ≤ 110\n   y ≤ 110 - x\n\n3. 2x + 4y ≤ 220\n   Divide by 2: x + 2y ≤ 110\n   y ≤ (110 - x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\nA. Intersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n   3x + 4y = 90\n   x + y = 110\n   Solve for x: x = 110 - y\n   Substitute x in the first equation: 3(110 - y) + 4y = 90\n   330 - 3y + 4y = 90\n   y = 240 / 1 = 240\n   x = 110 - 240 = -130 (not valid, as x ≥ 0)\n\nB. Intersection of constraint 1 and 3:\n   3x + 4y = 90\n   x + 2y = 110\n   Solve for x: x = 110 - 2y\n   Substitute x in the first equation: 3(110 - 2y) + 4y = 90\n   330 - 6y + 4y = 90\n   -2y = -240\n   y = 120\n   x = 110 - 2(120) = -130 (not valid, as x ≥ 0)\n\nC. Intersection of constraint 2 and 3:\n   x + y = 110\n   x + 2y = 110\n   Subtract the first equation from the second: y = 0\n   x = 110\n\nSo, the feasible region has only one vertex (110, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at this vertex:\n\nP(110, 0) = 30(110) + 20(0) = 3300\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 110 chairs and 0 tables to maximize their profit, which will be $3300."
