    "message_2": "To find the equation representing the displacement of the spring over time, we need to use the formula for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(2π * f * t + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude, f is the frequency, and φ is the phase angle. We are given the amplitude A = 7 cm and the period T = 2 seconds. We can find the frequency f using the formula:\n\nf = 1 / T\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nf = 1 / 2 = 0.5 Hz\n\nNow, we can write the equation for the displacement of the spring over time:\n\nx(t) = 7 * cos(2π * 0.5 * t + φ)\n\nSince we are not given any information about the initial position or velocity of the spring, we can assume that the spring starts at its maximum displacement and the phase angle φ = 0. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx(t) = 7 * cos(π * t)\n\nThe period and amplitude are already given as T = 2 seconds and A = 7 cm, respectively. So, the equation representing the displacement of the spring over time is:\n\nx(t) = 7 * cos(π * t)"
