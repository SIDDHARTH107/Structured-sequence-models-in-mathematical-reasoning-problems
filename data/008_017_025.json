    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the system in matrix form. The system can be written as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 4  5  6 |\n    | 7  8  9 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  9  |\n    | 18  |\n    | 27  |\n\nNow, we can use the sparse matrix representation for A and B. Sparse matrices store only the non-zero elements, along with their row and column indices. In this case, there are no zero elements in A and B, so the sparse representation will not save any space. However, we can still represent them in sparse format:\n\nSparse A = [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 3), (1, 0, 4), (1, 1, 5), (1, 2, 6), (2, 0, 7), (2, 1, 8), (2, 2, 9)]\nSparse B = [(0, 0, 9), (1, 0, 18), (2, 0, 27)]\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination or any other suitable method. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the third equation is just the sum of the first two equations:\n\n(1x + 2y + 3z) + (4x + 5y + 6z) = 9 + 18\n7x + 8y + 9z = 27\n\nThis means that the system of equations is dependent and does not have a unique solution. Instead, it has infinitely many solutions that can be expressed in terms of a free variable. In this case, we can express the solution in terms of z:\n\nFrom the first equation, we can write x in terms of z:\nx = 9 - 2y - 3z\n\nFrom the second equation, we can write y in terms of z:\ny = (18 - 4x - 6z) / 5 = (18 - 4(9 - 2y - 3z) - 6z) / 5 = 2z - 6\n\nNow, we can substitute y back into the equation for x:\nx = 9 - 2(2z - 6) - 3z = -z + 3\n\nSo the solution can be written as:\nx = -z + 3\ny = 2z - 6\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
