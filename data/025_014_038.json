    "message_1": "Given a curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4$ and a point $P = (-2,2)$ on the curve, find the value of the theta function $\\Theta_P = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp(\\pi i n^2 \\tau) \\exp(2\\pi i n z), $ where $\\tau$ is the complex parameter of the Riemann surface associated with the curve and $z$ is the point corresponding to $P$ on the Riemann surface.",
    "message_2": "To compute the theta function, we first need to find the complex parameter $\\tau$ and the point $z$ corresponding to $P$ on the Riemann surface. However, finding these values requires advanced techniques in algebraic geometry and complex analysis, which are beyond the scope of a simple text-based response.\n\nIn general, the process involves constructing the Riemann surface associated with the given curve, finding a suitable basis for the homology group of the surface, and computing the periods of the holomorphic differential forms on the surface. Once these periods are known, the complex parameter $\\tau$ can be determined, and the point $z$ can be found by integrating the holomorphic differential forms along paths on the surface.\n\nAfter obtaining $\\tau$ and $z$, the theta function $\\Theta_P$ can be computed using the given formula. However, due to the complexity of the problem and the advanced techniques required, it is not possible to provide a specific value for the theta function in this response."
