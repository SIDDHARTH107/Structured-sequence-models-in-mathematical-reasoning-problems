    "message_1": "Suppose that we have a power series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$, where $a_n$ is a sequence of real numbers and $z$ is a complex number. The power series converges at $z=2$ but diverges at $z=5$. Find the values of $a_0$, $a_1$, and $a_2$ if possible.",
    "message_2": "Since the power series converges at $z=2$ and diverges at $z=5$, we know that the radius of convergence $R$ must satisfy $0 < R \\leq 3$. The radius of convergence is given by the formula:\n\n$$R = \\frac{1}{\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n|^{\\frac{1}{n}}}$$\n\nNow, we know that $0 < R \\leq 3$, so:\n\n$$0 < \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n|^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\leq \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the exact values of $a_0$, $a_1$, and $a_2$ from the given information. The convergence of the power series at $z=2$ and divergence at $z=5$ only tells us about the behavior of the series as a whole, but it does not provide enough information to determine the individual coefficients $a_n$. There could be many different sequences of coefficients that satisfy the given conditions."
