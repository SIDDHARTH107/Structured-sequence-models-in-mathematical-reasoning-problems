    "message_1": "A spring-mass-damper system has a mass of 2 kg, a spring constant of 10 N/m, and a damping coefficient of 0.5 Ns/m. The displacement function of the system is given by x(t) = e^(-t/4) cos(3t). Determine the stability of the system with respect to the initial conditions. Use Fourier transform to analyze the stability of the system.",
    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the spring-mass-damper system, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the system. The governing equation for a spring-mass-damper system is given by:\n\nm * x''(t) + c * x'(t) + k * x(t) = 0\n\nwhere m is the mass, c is the damping coefficient, k is the spring constant, and x(t) is the displacement function. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n2 * x''(t) + 0.5 * x'(t) + 10 * x(t) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the characteristic equation by assuming a solution of the form x(t) = e^(rt):\n\n2 * r^2 * e^(rt) + 0.5 * r * e^(rt) + 10 * e^(rt) = 0\n\nDivide by e^(rt) to simplify:\n\n2 * r^2 + 0.5 * r + 10 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nr = (-0.5 ± sqrt(0.5^2 - 4 * 2 * 10)) / (2 * 2)\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\nr1 = -0.25 + 3i\nr2 = -0.25 - 3i\n\nThe real part of both roots is negative, which indicates that the system is stable with respect to the initial conditions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the stability using the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of x(t) is given by:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nX(ω) = ∫[e^(-t/4) * cos(3t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nTo find the Fourier transform, we can use integration by parts or lookup tables. However, since the system is already determined to be stable based on the characteristic equation, the Fourier transform analysis would not provide any additional information about the stability of the system.\n\nIn conclusion, the spring-mass-damper system is stable with respect to the initial conditions based on the characteristic equation analysis."
