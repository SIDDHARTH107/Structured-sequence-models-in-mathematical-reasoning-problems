    "message_1": "Suppose the current price of a stock is $100 per share. The probability of the stock price increasing by 10% in the next week is 0.25 and the probability of the stock price decreasing by 5% in the next week is 0.35. What is the probability that the stock price will either increase by 10% or decrease by 5% in the next week?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock price will either increase by 10% or decrease by 5% in the next week, we can simply add the probabilities of each event occurring, since they are mutually exclusive events (i.e., they cannot both happen at the same time).\n\nProbability of stock price increasing by 10% = 0.25\nProbability of stock price decreasing by 5% = 0.35\n\nProbability of either event occurring = Probability of stock price increasing by 10% + Probability of stock price decreasing by 5%\n\nProbability of either event occurring = 0.25 + 0.35 = 0.60\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will either increase by 10% or decrease by 5% in the next week is 0.60 or 60%."
