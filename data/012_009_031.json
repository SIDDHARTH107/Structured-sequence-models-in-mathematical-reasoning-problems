    "message_2": "It is not possible to draw this graph with the given degree sequence. Here's why:\n\nThe sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be even, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. In the given degree sequence, the sum of the degrees is:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21\n\nSince the sum of the degrees is odd (21), it is not possible to draw a graph with this degree sequence. This violates the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be twice the number of edges, and therefore even."
