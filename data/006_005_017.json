    "message_1": "A factory produces 1000 widgets per hour with a defect rate of 2%. What is the probability that in a 4-hour period, there will be fewer than 20 defective widgets produced?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (number of widgets produced), k is the number of defective widgets, p is the probability of a widget being defective, and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nIn this case, the factory produces 1000 widgets per hour for 4 hours, so n = 1000 * 4 = 4000. The defect rate is 2%, so p = 0.02. We want to find the probability of having fewer than 20 defective widgets, so we need to calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 19 and sum them up.\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\n\nWe can use a calculator or software to compute the binomial probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.0259\n\nSo the probability of having fewer than 20 defective widgets in a 4-hour period is approximately 2.59%."
