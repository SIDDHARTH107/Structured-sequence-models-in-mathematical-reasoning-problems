    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature (K) of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nLet's define the surface as a vector function:\n\nr(x, y) = (x, y, x^2 + y^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\nr_x = (∂r/∂x) = (1, 0, 2x)\nr_y = (∂r/∂y) = (0, 1, 2y)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), these partial derivatives become:\n\nr_x(1, 1) = (1, 0, 2)\nr_y(1, 1) = (0, 1, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_xx = (∂²r/∂x²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_yy = (∂²r/∂y²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_xy = (∂²r/∂x∂y) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), these second partial derivatives become:\n\nr_xx(1, 1) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_yy(1, 1) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_xy(1, 1) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nE = r_x • r_x = (1, 0, 2) • (1, 0, 2) = 1 + 4 = 5\nF = r_x • r_y = (1, 0, 2) • (0, 1, 2) = 0 + 0 + 4 = 4\nG = r_y • r_y = (0, 1, 2) • (0, 1, 2) = 0 + 1 + 4 = 5\n\nL = r_xx • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\nM = r_xy • N = (0, 0, 0) • (0, 0, 1) = 0\nN = r_yy • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface at the point (1, 1, 2), which can be computed as the cross product of r_x and r_y:\n\nN = r_x × r_y = (1, 0, 2) × (0, 1, 2) = (0, 0, 1)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = (2 * 2 - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - 4^2)\nK = (4) / (25 - 16)\nK = 4 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at the point (1, 1, 2) is K = 4/9."
