    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |x + 5| - 2, we need to determine the point at which the graph changes direction. This occurs when the expression inside the absolute value is equal to zero.\n\nx + 5 = 0\nx = -5\n\nNow, we can plug this value of x back into the equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\ny = |-5 + 5| - 2\ny = |0| - 2\ny = 0 - 2\ny = -2\n\nSo, the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |x + 5| - 2 is (-5, -2)."
