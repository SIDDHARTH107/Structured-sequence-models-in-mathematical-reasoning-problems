    "message_2": "To find the optimal value and the corresponding optimal solution for this problem, we first need to find the critical points of the function $f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5$. We do this by taking the derivative of the function with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero:\n\n$f'(x) = 2x - 6 = 0$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = 3$\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point satisfies the constraint $x \\geq 0$. Since $3 \\geq 0$, the constraint is satisfied.\n\nNext, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. We do this by taking the second derivative of the function with respect to $x$:\n\n$f''(x) = 2$\n\nSince $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$, the function is convex, and the critical point we found is indeed a minimum.\n\nThus, the optimal value is $f(3) = 3^2 - 6(3) + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5 = -4$, and the corresponding optimal solution is $x = 3$."
