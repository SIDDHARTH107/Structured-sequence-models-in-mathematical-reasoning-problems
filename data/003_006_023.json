    "message_1": "A triangle has an angle of 45° and a side opposite to it has a length of 7 cm. Another angle measures 60° and the opposite side has a length of 8 cm. Find the length of the third side using the law of sines.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the angles as A, B, and C, and the sides opposite to them as a, b, and c respectively. We are given:\n\nA = 45°, a = 7 cm\nB = 60°, b = 8 cm\n\nWe need to find the length of side c. First, let's find angle C. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, we have:\n\nC = 180° - (A + B) = 180° - (45° + 60°) = 180° - 105° = 75°\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side c:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe can use the given information to set up a proportion:\n\n7/sin(45°) = 8/sin(60°) = c/sin(75°)\n\nTo find c, we can set up the proportion:\n\nc/sin(75°) = 7/sin(45°)\n\nNow, we can solve for c:\n\nc = (7/sin(45°)) * sin(75°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that sin(45°) ≈ 0.7071, sin(60°) ≈ 0.8660, and sin(75°) ≈ 0.9659. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc ≈ (7/0.7071) * 0.9659 ≈ 9.607\n\nTherefore, the length of the third side (c) is approximately 9.61 cm."
