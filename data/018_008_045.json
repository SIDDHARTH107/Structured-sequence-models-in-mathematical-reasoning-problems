    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. \n\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B (A × B):\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A (B × A):\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements in A × B and B × A are not the same. For example, (1, 4) is in A × B but not in B × A, and (4, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B. Therefore, A × B ≠ B × A, which proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
