    "message_2": "To find the general solution to this differential equation, we need to integrate the given function with respect to x.\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 6x - 4\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\ny(x) = ∫(3x^2 - 6x - 4) dx\n\nNow, we integrate the function term by term:\n\ny(x) = 3∫x^2 dx - 6∫x dx - 4∫1 dx\n\nUsing the power rule for integration, we have:\n\ny(x) = 3(x^3/3) - 6(x^2/2) - 4x + C\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get the general solution:\n\ny(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
