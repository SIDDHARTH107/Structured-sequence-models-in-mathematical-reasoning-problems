    "message_1": "Suppose a statistics class has 25 students, and the average height of the students is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 7 cm. If you randomly select 10 students from the class to participate in a bootstrapping study, what is the probability that the average height of these 10 students will be within 2 cm of the class average height?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 170 cm, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 7 cm. We are given a sample size (n) of 10 students.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which is called the standard error (SE). The formula for the standard error is:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 7 / √10 ≈ 2.21 cm\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the average height of the 10 students is within 2 cm of the class average height, which means the sample mean (x̄) should be between 168 cm and 172 cm.\n\nTo find the probability, we will use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower bound (168 cm):\n\nz1 = (168 - 170) / 2.21 ≈ -0.90\n\nFor the upper bound (172 cm):\n\nz2 = (172 - 170) / 2.21 ≈ 0.90\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score falls between -0.90 and 0.90. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these two z-scores.\n\nP(-0.90 < z < 0.90) ≈ 0.8159\n\nTherefore, the probability that the average height of the 10 students will be within 2 cm of the class average height is approximately 81.59%."
