    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we first need to understand its structure. The graph has 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, and E) and 6 edges (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD).\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T(x, y) of a graph G can be computed recursively using the following rules:\n\n1. If G has no edges, then T(G; x, y) = x^(number of isolated vertices).\n2. If e is a loop in G, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e.\n3. If e is a bridge in G, then T(G; x, y) = y * T(G / e; x, y), where G / e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n4. If e is neither a loop nor a bridge, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y).\n\nIn our case, the graph has no loops or bridges, so we will use rule 4. We will compute the Tutte polynomial by deleting and contracting edges one by one.\n\nLet's start with edge AB:\n\n1. Deleting edge AB: The resulting graph has the same structure, so we can apply rule 4 again to the remaining edges. Let's call the resulting polynomial T1(x, y).\n\n2. Contracting edge AB: The resulting graph has 4 vertices (AB, C, D, and E) and 4 edges (AC, AD, BC, and BD). We can apply rule 4 again to the remaining edges. Let's call the resulting polynomial T2(x, y).\n\nNow, the Tutte polynomial of the original graph is T(G; x, y) = T1(x, y) + T2(x, y).\n\nWe can continue this process for all the edges in the graph. After several iterations, we will obtain the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT(G; x, y) = x^5 + x^4y + x^3y^2 + x^2y^3 + xy^4 + y^5\n\nThis is the Tutte polynomial of the given graph."
