    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular octagon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = 2 * a^2 * (1 + √2)\n\nwhere a is the side length of the octagon.\n\nIn this case, the side length (a) is 6 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = 2 * (6 cm)^2 * (1 + √2)\nArea = 2 * 36 cm^2 * (1 + 1.4142)\nArea = 72 cm^2 * (2.4142)\nArea ≈ 173.823 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the regular octagon is approximately 173.823 square centimeters."
