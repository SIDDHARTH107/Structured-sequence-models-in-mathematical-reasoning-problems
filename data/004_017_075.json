    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we need to use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x) on the interval [a, b]:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = 2x^(3/2)/3 with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^(3/2)/3)/dx = (3/2) * (2/3) * x^(1/2) = x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find (f'(x))^2:\n\n(f'(x))^2 = (x^(1/2))^2 = x\n\nNext, we need to find sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2):\n\nsqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) = sqrt(1 + x)\n\nNow, we can find the length of the curve using the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + x, then du = dx:\n\nL = ∫[1, 5] sqrt(u) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (2/3) * u^(3/2) | [1, 5]\n\nL = (2/3) * (5^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (2/3) * (5 * sqrt(5) - 1)\n\nL = (10/3) * sqrt(5) - 2/3\n\nSo, the length of the curve is L = (10/3) * sqrt(5) - 2/3."
