    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: chairs and tables. The factory has 120 units of wood, 80 units of metal and 100 units of labor. Each chair requires 2 units of wood, 4 units of metal and 6 units of labor; each table requires 4 units of wood, 2 units of metal and 5 units of labor. If the profit from each chair sold is $40 and the profit from each table sold is $60, what is the optimal number of chairs and tables that the factory should produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are as follows:\n\nWood: 2x + 4y ≤ 120\nMetal: 4x + 2y ≤ 80\nLabor: 6x + 5y ≤ 100\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 40x + 60y.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 120\nDivide by 2: x + 2y ≤ 60\ny ≥ (60 - x)/2\n\n2. 4x + 2y ≤ 80\nDivide by 2: 2x + y ≤ 40\ny ≤ 40 - 2x\n\n3. 6x + 5y ≤ 100\ny ≤ (100 - 6x)/5\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (60 - x)/2 and y = 40 - 2x:\n(60 - x)/2 = 40 - 2x\n60 - x = 80 - 4x\n3x = 20\nx = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\ny = (60 - 20/3)/2 ≈ 26.67\n\n2. Intersection of y = (60 - x)/2 and y = (100 - 6x)/5:\n(60 - x)/2 = (100 - 6x)/5\n300 - 5x = 200 - 12x\n7x = 100\nx ≈ 14.29\ny ≈ 22.86\n\n3. Intersection of y = 40 - 2x and y = (100 - 6x)/5:\n40 - 2x = (100 - 6x)/5\n200 - 10x = 100 - 6x\n4x = 100\nx = 25\ny = 40 - 2(25) = -10 (not feasible)\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at the vertices:\n\n1. P(6.67, 26.67) ≈ 40(6.67) + 60(26.67) ≈ 1866.8\n2. P(14.29, 22.86) ≈ 40(14.29) + 60(22.86) ≈ 1857.14\n\nSince P(6.67, 26.67) > P(14.29, 22.86), the optimal number of chairs and tables to maximize profit is approximately 7 chairs and 27 tables, with a profit of approximately $1866.8. Note that the factory cannot produce a fraction of a chair or table, so we round the numbers to the nearest whole number."
