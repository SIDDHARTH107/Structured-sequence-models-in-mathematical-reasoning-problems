    "message_2": "To determine the allowed energy levels of the particle, we need to solve the Schrödinger equation for each region of the potential well and apply boundary conditions to find the quantized energy levels.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n$a = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$\n$b = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$\n$L = 5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$\n$V_0 = 1 \\text{ eV} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nNow, let's solve the Schrödinger equation for each region:\n\n1.

However, this is a transcendental equation and cannot be solved analytically. To find the allowed energy levels, we need to solve the equations numerically."
