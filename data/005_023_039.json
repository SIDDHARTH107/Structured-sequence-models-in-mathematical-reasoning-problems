    "message_2": "First, we need to sort the dataset in ascending order:\n\n{49, 69, 74, 78, 79, 81, 83, 85, 86, 88, 91, 92, 97, 98, 102}\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2), lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3):\n\nQ2 (Median) = 85 (since there are 15 data points, the median is the 8th value)\n\nQ1 (Lower Quartile) = 74 (since there are 7 data points below the median, the lower quartile is the 4th value)\n\nQ3 (Upper Quartile) = 92 (since there are 7 data points above the median, the upper quartile is the 12th value)\n\nNow, we calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 92 - 74 = 18\n\nNext, we determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 74 - 1.5 * 18 = 47\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 92 + 1.5 * 18 = 119\n\nFinally, we check if there are any values in the dataset that fall outside the lower and upper bounds:\n\n49 is within the bounds (47 ≤ 49 ≤ 119), so there are no outliers in this dataset."
