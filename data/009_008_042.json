Take $L=1$ and $c=1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$$\n$$T''(t) + c^2 \\lambda T(t) = 0$$\n\nWe'll solve the spatial equation first. Since the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions:\n\n$$X(0) = X(L) = 0$$\n\nFor non-trivial solutions, we need $\\lambda > 0$. Thus, we can write $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$ for some integer $n$. The general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) + B\\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $B = 0$ and $A\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$. Since $A = 0$ would give a trivial solution, we must have $n\\pi = m\\pi$ for some integer $m$, so $n = m$. Thus, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nNow, let's solve the temporal equation:\n\n$$T''(t) + c^2 \\lambda T(t) = 0$$\n\nSince $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$ and $c=1$, the equation becomes:\n\n$$T''(t) + \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 T(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for this equation is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\cos\\left(\\frac{m\\pi t}{L}\\right) + D\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi t}{L}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\n$$u(x,0) = X(x)T(0) = A\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)C = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nSince $L=1$, we have:\n\n$$AC\\sin(m\\pi x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$$\n\nComparing the two sides, we see that $m=1$, $A=1$, and $C=1$. Now, we apply the initial velocity condition:\n\n$$u_t(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)D = 0$$\n\nThis implies that $D=0$. Therefore, the solution for $u(x,t)$ is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right)$$\n\nSince $L=1$, the final solution is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi t)$$"
