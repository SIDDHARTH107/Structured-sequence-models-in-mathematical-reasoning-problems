    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 2x² + 3x + 1, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nThe antiderivative F(x) is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(2x² + 3x + 1) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\n∫(2x²) dx = (2/3)x³ + C₁\n\n∫(3x) dx = (3/2)x² + C₂\n\n∫(1) dx = x + C₃\n\nNow, we will add the results of the three integrals:\n\nF(x) = (2/3)x³ + (3/2)x² + x + C\n\nHere, C is the constant of integration, which is the sum of C₁, C₂, and C₃."
