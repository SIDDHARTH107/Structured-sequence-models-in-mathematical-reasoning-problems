    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The angle between the ladder and the ground is 60 degrees and the ladder is 10 meters long. How far is the foot of the ladder from the base of the wall?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using trigonometry. In this case, we have a right triangle formed by the ladder, the wall, and the ground. The angle between the ladder and the ground is 60 degrees, and the ladder (the hypotenuse) is 10 meters long.\n\nWe want to find the distance between the foot of the ladder and the base of the wall, which is the adjacent side of the triangle. We can use the cosine function to find this distance:\n\ncos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\ncos(60°) = adjacent side / 10 meters\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5 (since the cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5)\n\nNow, we can solve for the adjacent side:\n\n0.5 = adjacent side / 10 meters\n\nAdjacent side = 0.5 * 10 meters = 5 meters\n\nSo, the foot of the ladder is 5 meters away from the base of the wall."
