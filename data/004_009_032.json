    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2*sin(x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together: u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = sin(x).\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is given by:\n\n(f(x) = u(x)v(x))' = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = (x^2)' = 2x\nv'(x) = (sin(x))' = cos(x)\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x) = 2x*sin(x) + x^2*cos(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of f(x) at x = π/2:\n\nf'(π/2) = 2(π/2)*sin(π/2) + (π/2)^2*cos(π/2)\nf'(π/2) = π*(1) + (π^2/4)*(0)\nf'(π/2) = π\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^2*sin(x) at x = π/2 is π."
