    "message_2": "To determine the number of different 4-player bridge games possible, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 52 cards among the 4 players, with each player receiving 13 cards.\n\nWe can use the concept of combinations to solve this problem. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of the items does not matter.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 13 cards for the first player from the 52 cards. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nFor the first player, we have:\n\nC(52, 13) = 52! / (13!(52-13)!) = 52! / (13!39!)\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 13 cards for the second player from the remaining 39 cards:\n\nC(39, 13) = 39! / (13!(39-13)!) = 39! / (13!26!)\n\nFor the third player, we have:\n\nC(26, 13) = 26! / (13!(26-13)!) = 26! / (13!13!)\n\nFinally, the fourth player will receive the remaining 13 cards, so there is only 1 way to distribute the cards to the fourth player.\n\nTo find the total number of different 4-player bridge games, we multiply the number of combinations for each player:\n\nTotal games = C(52, 13) × C(39, 13) × C(26, 13) × 1\n\nTotal games = (52! / (13!39!)) × (39! / (13!26!)) × (26! / (13!13!))\n\nThe factorials in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nTotal games = 52! / (13! × 13! × 13! × 13!)\n\nTotal games ≈ 53,644,737,765,488,792,839,237,440,000\n\nSo, there are approximately 53.6 x 10^27 different 4-player bridge games possible with a standard deck of 52 playing cards."
