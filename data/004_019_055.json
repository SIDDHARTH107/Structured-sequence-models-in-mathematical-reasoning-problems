At time t=0, the car's velocity is 30 m/s and its acceleration is 5 m/s^2. Find the car's velocity and position functions if its acceleration is constant. What is the car's position at time t=3 seconds?",
    "message_2": "Given that the car's initial velocity (v0) is 30 m/s and its constant acceleration (a) is 5 m/s^2, we can find the velocity function (v(t)) using the formula:\n\nv(t) = v0 + a*t\n\nv(t) = 30 + 5*t\n\nNow, to find the position function (s(t)), we can integrate the velocity function with respect to time:\n\ns(t) = integral(v(t) dt) = integral(30 + 5*t dt)\n\ns(t) = 30*t + (5/2)*t^2 + C\n\nSince the initial position (s0) is not given, we can assume it to be 0 for simplicity. Therefore, at t=0, s(0) = 0:\n\n0 = 30*0 + (5/2)*0^2 + C\nC = 0\n\nSo, the position function is:\n\ns(t) = 30*t + (5/2)*t^2\n\nNow, we can find the car's position at time t=3 seconds:\n\ns(3) = 30*3 + (5/2)*3^2\ns(3) = 90 + (15/2)*9\ns(3) = 90 + 67.5\ns(3) = 157.5 meters\n\nThus, at t=3 seconds, the car's position is 157.5 meters along the straight road."
