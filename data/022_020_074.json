    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we first rewrite the given equation in terms of real and imaginary parts of the complex function $f(z)$. Let $f(z) = u(x, t) + iv(x, t)$, where $u(x, t)$ and $v(x, t)$ are real functions and $z = x + it$. Then, $\\bar{z} = x - it$, and we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f(z)}{\\partial z^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x^2} - 2i\\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x \\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial^2 v(x, t)}{\\partial t^2}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f(z)}{\\partial \\bar{z}^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x^2} + 2i\\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x \\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial^2 v(x, t)}{\\partial t^2}$\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\n$2\\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x^2} - 2\\frac{\\partial^2 v(x, t)}{\\partial t^2} = 0$\n\nNow, we have a partial differential equation (PDE) for the real part of the complex function $f(z)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v(x, t)}{\\partial t^2}$\n\nWe also have the boundary conditions:\n\n$u(0, t) = \\cos(t)$\n\n$u(\\pi/2, t) = 0$\n\nTo solve this PDE, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Then, the PDE becomes:\n\n$X''(x)T(t) = X(x)T''(t)$\n\nDividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)}$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $x$ and the right-hand side depends only on $t$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = -k^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n$X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$\n\n$T''(t) - k^2T(t) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we have:\n\n$u(0, t) = X(0)T(t) = A\\cos(0)T(t) = A\\cdot 1 \\cdot T(t) = \\cos(t)$\n\n$u(\\pi/2, t) = X(\\pi/2)T(t) = (A\\cos(k\\pi/2) + B\\sin(k\\pi/2))T(t) = 0$\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, we have $A = \\cos(t)$. From the second boundary condition, we have:\n\n$\\cos(k\\pi/2) = 0$\n\nThis implies that $k = (2n + 1)/2$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. Therefore, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X(x) = \\cos(t)\\cos((2n + 1)x/2)$\n\nThe general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cosh(kt) + D\\sinh(kt)$\n\nSince $A = \\cos(t)$, we have:\n\n$u(x, t) = \\cos(t)\\cos((2n + 1)x/2)(C\\cosh(kt) + D\\sinh(kt))$\n\nThis is the solution for the real part of the complex function $f(z)$. To find the imaginary part $v(x, t)$, we can integrate the PDE for $v(x, t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$v(x, t) = \\int \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x^2} dt = \\int X''(x)T(t) dt$\n\nHowever, without additional boundary conditions or information about the imaginary part, we cannot determine the exact form of $v(x, t)$."
