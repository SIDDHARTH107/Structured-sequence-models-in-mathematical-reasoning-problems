    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the medical condition, you can multiply the population size by the probability of having the condition:\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = Population size × Probability of having the condition\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 10,000 × 0.05\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 500\n\nSo, in this population of 10,000 people, the expected number of people with the medical condition is 500."
