    "message_1": "Suppose a restaurant offers three types of sandwiches (chicken, turkey, and veggie) and four types of sides (fries, salad, soup, and onion rings). In how many ways can a customer choose a sandwich and a side?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of ways a customer can choose a sandwich and a side, we can use the counting principle. The counting principle states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another, then there are m * n ways to do both.\n\nIn this case, there are 3 types of sandwiches and 4 types of sides. So, the total number of ways a customer can choose a sandwich and a side is:\n\n3 (types of sandwiches) * 4 (types of sides) = 12 ways."
