We will start by selecting a vertex with the smallest degree and remove it along with its neighbors. We will repeat this process until there are no vertices left in the graph.\n\n1. Vertex 1 has the smallest degree (2). Select vertex 1 and remove it along with its neighbors (vertices 2 and 3).\n\nRemaining graph:\n\n    0 0 0 1 1 0\n    0 0 1 1 1\n    0 1 1 1\n    0 1 1\n    0 0\n\n2.
