    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method to find the roots of a nonlinear equation. The formula for the Newton-Raphson method is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nwhere x0 is the initial guess, x1 is the next approximation, f(x0) is the function value at x0, and f'(x0) is the derivative of the function at x0.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 2, we first need to find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, we can start the iteration process with the initial guess x0 = 1.5. We will continue iterating until the absolute difference between two consecutive approximations is less than the error tolerance (0.001).\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\nx1 = 1.5 - (1.5^3 - 2*1.5 + 2) / (3*(1.5^2) - 2)\nx1 = 1.5 - (3.375 - 3 + 2) / (6.75 - 2)\nx1 = 1.5 - (2.375) / (4.75)\nx1 ≈ 1.0\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1)\nx2 = 1.0 - (1.0^3 - 2*1.0 + 2) / (3*(1.0^2) - 2)\nx2 = 1.0 - (1 - 2 + 2) / (3 - 2)\nx2 = 1.0 - (1) / (1)\nx2 = 0\n\nSince the absolute difference between x1 and x2 is greater than the error tolerance (1 > 0.001), we need to continue iterating.\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - f(x2) / f'(x2)\nx3 = 0 - (0^3 - 2*0 + 2) / (3*(0^2) - 2)\nx3 = 0 - (2) / (-2)\nx3 = 1\n\nNow, the absolute difference between x2 and x3 is less than the error tolerance (1 - 0 = 1 < 0.001). Therefore, we can stop iterating and conclude that the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 2 = 0 is approximately x ≈ 1.0, with an error tolerance of 0.001."
