    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 10 cm and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (10 × 6) / 2\nArea = 60 / 2\nArea = 30 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 30 square centimeters."
