    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges. Determine if the graph has an Eulerian path, and if so, find one. Also, determine if the graph has a Hamiltonian path or cycle.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the graph has an Eulerian path, we need to check the degrees of the vertices. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree, and all other vertices have an even degree. However, without knowing the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot determine the degrees of the vertices and thus cannot determine if there is an Eulerian path.\n\nAs for the Hamiltonian path or cycle, it is an NP-complete problem, meaning there is no known efficient algorithm to determine if a graph has a Hamiltonian path or cycle. Without knowing the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot determine if there is a Hamiltonian path or cycle in the graph."
