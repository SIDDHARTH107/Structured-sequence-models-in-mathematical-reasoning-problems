    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 1 -2  4 |\n    | 5  1 -3 |\n\nb = |  8  |\n    | -1  |\n    | 10  |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a technique to decompose a given matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (e.g., Python, MATLAB), we get:\n\nQ = | -0.37  0.80 -0.47 |\n    | -0.19 -0.60 -0.77 |\n    | -0.93 -0.12  0.36 |\n\nR = | -5.39 -1.93  3.32 |\n    |  0   -3.46  1.37 |\n    |  0     0    3.87 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^T * b, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nQ^T * b = | -0.37 -0.19 -0.93 | |  8  | = | 1.00 |\n          |  0.80 -0.60 -0.12 | | -1  |   | 3.00 |\n          | -0.47 -0.77  0.36 | | 10  |   | 2.00 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = | 1.00 |\n                                               | 3.00 |\n                                               | 2.00 |\n\nUsing back-substitution, we get:\n\nx = 1.00\ny = -1.00\nz = 0.52\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1.00, y = -1.00, and z = 0.52 (rounded to two decimal places)."
