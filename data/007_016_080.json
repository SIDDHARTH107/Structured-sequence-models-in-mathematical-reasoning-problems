    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 50, we can test prime numbers greater than 50 and check if 2p + 1 is also prime.\n\nThe prime numbers greater than 50 are: 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, ...\n\nLet's test these prime numbers:\n\n1. For p = 53, 2p + 1 = 107, which is prime. Therefore, the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 50 is 53."
