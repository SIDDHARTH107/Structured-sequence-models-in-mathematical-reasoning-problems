    "message_2": "To solve the integral equation, we will use the method of successive approximations (also known as the Neumann series method). We will start with an initial guess y_0(x) and then iteratively improve our guess.\n\nLet y_0(x) = 0. Then, we can define the successive approximations y_n(x) as follows:\n\ny_n(x) = 1 + x^2 + ∫0^1 (x + t)y_{n-1}(t)dt\n\nNow, let's compute the first few approximations:\n\ny_1(x) = 1 + x^2 + ∫0^1 (x + t)y_0(t)dt = 1 + x^2\n\ny_2(x) = 1 + x^2 + ∫0^1 (x + t)y_1(t)dt = 1 + x^2 + ∫0^1 (x + t)(1 + t^2)dt\n\nTo compute the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\n∫0^1 (x + t)(1 + t^2)dt = ∫0^1 (x + t^3 + t)dt = [x(1/2) + (1/4)t^4 + (1/2)t^2]_0^1 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/2 = 5/4\n\nSo, y_2(x) = 1 + x^2 + 5/4\n\nWe can continue this process to compute more approximations, but it's important to note that the successive approximations may not always converge to a unique solution. In this case, we can't guarantee that the Neumann series method will provide an exact solution to the integral equation.\n\nHowever, we can still use the approximations to get an idea of the behavior of the function y(x). In this case, we have:\n\ny(x) ≈ 1 + x^2 + 5/4\n\nThis is an approximate solution to the given integral equation."
