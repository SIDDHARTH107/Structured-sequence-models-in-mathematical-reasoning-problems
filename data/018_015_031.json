    "message_1": "There are two sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B and then find the intersection of the resulting set with the Cartesian product of B and A. Show that these two sets are not equivalent, and hence, prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A.\n\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNext, we will find the intersection of the resulting sets, which is the set of all ordered pairs that are present in both A × B and B × A.\n\n(A × B) ∩ (B × A) = {(2, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets A × B and B × A. We can see that they are not equal, as there are different ordered pairs in each set.\n\nA × B ≠ B × A\n\nSince the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection, we have proven that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative in general."
