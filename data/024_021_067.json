Find all Killing vector fields of this metric, and verify that the Lie derivative of the metric along each of these vector fields is zero.",
    "message_2": "To find the Killing vector fields, we need to solve the Killing equation for the given metric. The Killing equation is given by:\n\n$\\nabla_\\mu X_\\nu + \\nabla_\\nu X_\\mu = 0$\n\nwhere $X_\\mu$ are the components of the Killing vector field and $\\nabla_\\mu$ is the covariant derivative. For the given metric, the metric tensor components are:\n\n$g_{11} = 9, g_{22} = 4, g_{33} = 16, g_{12} = g_{13} = g_{23} = 0$\n\nThe Christoffel symbols for this metric are:\n\n$\\Gamma^1_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{11} - \\partial_1 g_{11} + \\partial_1 g_{11}) = 0$\n\n$\\Gamma^1_{22} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_2 g_{22} - \\partial_2 g_{11} + \\partial_1 g_{12}) = 0$\n\n$\\Gamma^1_{33} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_3 g_{33} - \\partial_3 g_{11} + \\partial_1 g_{13}) = 0$\n\n$\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_1 g_{22} - \\partial_2 g_{12} + \\partial_2 g_{12}) = 0$\n\n$\\Gamma^2_{23} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_3 g_{23} - \\partial_3 g_{22} + \\partial_2 g_{23}) = 0$\n\n$\\Gamma^3_{13} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_1 g_{33} - \\partial_3 g_{13} + \\partial_3 g_{13}) = 0$\n\n$\\Gamma^3_{23} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_2 g_{23} - \\partial_3 g_{23} + \\partial_3 g_{23}) = 0$\n\nAll other Christoffel symbols are zero. Now we can write down the Killing equations:\n\n1) $\\partial_1 X_1 = 0$\n\n2) $\\partial_2 X_2 = 0$\n\n3) $\\partial_3 X_3 = 0$\n\n4) $\\partial_1 X_2 + \\partial_2 X_1 = 0$\n\n5) $\\partial_1 X_3 + \\partial_3 X_1 = 0$\n\n6) $\\partial_2 X_3 + \\partial_3 X_2 = 0$\n\nFrom equations (1), (2), and (3), we see that $X_1 = X_1(x^2, x^3)$, $X_2 = X_2(x^1, x^3)$, and $X_3 = X_3(x^1, x^2)$. Now, we can solve equations (4), (5), and (6) for the remaining components:\n\n4) $\\partial_1 X_2 = -\\partial_2 X_1$\n\n5) $\\partial_1 X_3 = -\\partial_3 X_1$\n\n6) $\\partial_2 X_3 = -\\partial_3 X_2$\n\nIntegrating these equations, we obtain:\n\n$X_1 = -a_1 x^2 - a_2 x^3 + f(x^1)$\n\n$X_2 = a_1 x^1 - a_3 x^3 + g(x^2)$\n\n$X_3 = a_2 x^1 + a_3 x^2 + h(x^3)$\n\nwhere $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are constants and $f(x^1)$, $g(x^2)$, and $h(x^3)$ are arbitrary functions of their respective coordinates.\n\nNow, we need to verify that the Lie derivative of the metric along each of these vector fields is zero. The Lie derivative of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ along a vector field $X^\\mu$ is given by:\n\n$\\mathcal{L}_X g_{\\mu\\nu} = X^\\alpha \\partial_\\alpha g_{\\mu\\nu} + g_{\\alpha\\nu} \\partial_\\mu X^\\alpha + g_{\\mu\\alpha} \\partial_\\nu X^\\alpha$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal and constant, the first term is zero. The second and third terms are also zero due to the Killing equations. Therefore, the Lie derivative of the metric along each of these vector fields is zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the Killing vector fields for the given metric are:\n\n$X_1 = -a_1 x^2 - a_2 x^3 + f(x^1)$\n\n$X_2 = a_1 x^1 - a_3 x^3 + g(x^2)$\n\n$X_3 = a_2 x^1 + a_3 x^2 + h(x^3)$\n\nwith constants $a_1, a_2, a_3$ and arbitrary functions $f(x^1)$, $g(x^2)$, and $h(x^3)$."
