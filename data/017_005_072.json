    "message_2": "We will use the Sylow Theorems to prove that G is a cyclic group.\n\nLet G be a group of order 125 = 5^3. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1, since 125 is not congruent to 1 modulo 5. Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, which we will denote by P.\n\nSince P is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, it must be a normal subgroup of G. The order of P is 5^2 = 25, so P is a group of order 25. By the classification of groups of order p^2 for p prime, P is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. In either case, P has an element of order 25, which we will denote by x.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since the order of G is 125 and the order of P is 25, the order of G/P is 5. Thus, G/P is a cyclic group, and there exists an element gP in G/P with order 5. This means that the order of g in G is a multiple of 5, but not a multiple of 25 (since gP has order 5 in G/P). Therefore, the order of g in G is 5.\n\nNow, consider the element gx in G. Since the orders of g and x are relatively prime (5 and 25), by the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, the order of gx is the least common multiple of the orders of g and x, which is 5 * 25 = 125. Since gx has order 125, it generates the entire group G, and G is cyclic.\n\nThus, G is a cyclic group of order 125."
