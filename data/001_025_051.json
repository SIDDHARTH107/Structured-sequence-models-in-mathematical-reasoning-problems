    "message_2": "Let z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n|2(a + bi) - 5i| = 3\n\nSimplify the expression inside the absolute value:\n\n|(2a + 2bi - 5i)| = 3\n\nNow, we can rewrite the absolute value of a complex number as the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts:\n\n√((2a)^2 + (2b - 5)^2) = 3\n\nSquare both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n(2a)^2 + (2b - 5)^2 = 9\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n4a^2 + 4(b^2 - 10b + 25) = 9\n\n4a^2 + 4b^2 - 40b + 100 = 9\n\nDivide the equation by 4:\n\na^2 + b^2 - 10b + 25 = 9/4\n\nNow, complete the square for the b terms:\n\na^2 + (b - 5)^2 = 9/4\n\nThis equation represents a circle with center (0, 5) and radius 3/2 in the complex plane. To find the complex numbers z that satisfy this equation, we can parameterize the circle using polar coordinates:\n\na = (3/2)cos(θ)\nb = 5 + (3/2)sin(θ)\n\nNow, substitute these expressions back into z = a + bi:\n\nz = (3/2)cos(θ) + [5 + (3/2)sin(θ)]i\n\nHere, θ can be any real number, and it will give a different complex number z that satisfies the equation |2z - 5i| = 3."
