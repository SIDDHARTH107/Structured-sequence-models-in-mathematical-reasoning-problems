D_60: The dihedral group of order 120, which is the group of symmetries of a regular 60-gon.\n3. A_5: The alternating group on 5 elements, which is the group of even permutations of 5 elements. It has order 60, but its external direct product with the cyclic group of order 2 (C_2) gives a group of order 120.\n4. S_5: The symmetric group on 5 elements, which is the group of all permutations of 5 elements. It has order 120.\n5. SL(2,5): The special linear group of 2x2 matrices with determinant 1 over the finite field with 5 elements. It has order 120.\n\nThese are the 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
