    "message_1": "A car has an acceleration function of a(t) = 3t - 4, where t is measured in seconds and a(t) is measured in meters per second squared. If the car starts at rest at time t = 0, what is its velocity after 5 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity after 5 seconds, we need to integrate the acceleration function with respect to time. The acceleration function is a(t) = 3t - 4.\n\nLet v(t) be the velocity function. Then,\n\nv(t) = âˆ«(3t - 4) dt\n\nIntegrating the function, we get:\n\nv(t) = (3/2)t^2 - 4t + C\n\nSince the car starts at rest at time t = 0, the initial velocity is 0. We can use this information to find the constant C:\n\n0 = (3/2)(0)^2 - 4(0) + C\nC = 0\n\nSo, the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = (3/2)t^2 - 4t\n\nNow, we can find the velocity after 5 seconds by plugging t = 5 into the velocity function:\n\nv(5) = (3/2)(5)^2 - 4(5)\nv(5) = (3/2)(25) - 20\nv(5) = 37.5 - 20\nv(5) = 17.5\n\nThe velocity of the car after 5 seconds is 17.5 meters per second."
