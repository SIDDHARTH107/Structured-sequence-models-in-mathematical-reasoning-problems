    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is used to find the optimal solution for a given problem. In this case, we want to maximize the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 5 within the range -5 <= x <= 5.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to applying the cuckoo search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialization: Set the number of nests (n), the maximum number of iterations (max_iter), and the discovery rate (p_a). For this problem, let's set n = 25, max_iter = 100, and p_a = 0.25.\n\n2. Generate initial solutions: Randomly generate n solutions (nests) within the given range (-5 <= x <= 5).\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each solution: Calculate the value of f(x) for each nest and store the results.\n\n4. Start the iteration process: For each iteration, perform the following steps:\n\n  a. Choose a random nest (i) and generate a new solution (x_new) by applying a random walk (Levy flight) to the current solution (x_i).\n\n  b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution (f(x_new)).\n\n  c. If f(x_new) is better than f(x_i), replace the nest i with the new solution.\n\n  d. Randomly choose a fraction (p_a * n) of the worst nests and replace them with new solutions generated by random walks.\n\n  e. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n5. Repeat step 4 until the maximum number of iterations (max_iter) is reached.\n\n6. Return the best solution found.\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm with the given parameters, you will find the optimal solution (x value) that maximizes the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 5 within the range -5 <= x <= 5. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm."
