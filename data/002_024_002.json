    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and its two bases are 12 cm and 18 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. We can do this by dividing the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter base to the longer base.\n\nLet's call the length of one of the legs of the right triangle \"a\" and the other leg \"b\". The height of the trapezium is the same as the height of each right triangle, which is 8 cm. The difference between the two bases is 18 cm - 12 cm = 6 cm. We can divide this difference equally between the two right triangles, so each triangle has a base of 3 cm.\n\nNow we have two right triangles with legs of 3 cm and 8 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (the other two sides of the trapezium) for each triangle:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n3^2 + 8^2 = c^2\n9 + 64 = c^2\n73 = c^2\nc = √73\n\nSo, the length of each of the other two sides of the trapezium is √73 cm.\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = shorter base + longer base + 2 * (√73)\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 18 cm + 2 * (√73)\nPerimeter ≈ 12 cm + 18 cm + 2 * (8.54 cm)\nPerimeter ≈ 12 cm + 18 cm + 17.08 cm\nPerimeter ≈ 47.08 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 47.08 cm."
