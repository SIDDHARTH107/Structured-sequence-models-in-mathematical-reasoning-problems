The demand equation for this product is given by P = 1000 - 2Q, where P is the price per unit and Q is the quantity demanded. Write the profit equation for this company and find the optimal price to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "To find the profit equation, we first need to find the revenue equation. Revenue (R) is the product of the price (P) and the quantity demanded (Q). So, we have:\n\nR = P * Q\n\nWe are given the demand equation P = 1000 - 2Q. We can substitute this into the revenue equation:\n\nR = (1000 - 2Q) * Q\nR = 1000Q - 2Q^2\n\nNow, we need to find the cost equation. Since the cost per unit is fixed at $500, the total cost (C) is:\n\nC = 500Q\n\nNow we can find the profit equation. Profit (π) is the difference between revenue and cost:\n\nπ = R - C\nπ = (1000Q - 2Q^2) - 500Q\nπ = -2Q^2 + 500Q\n\nTo find the optimal price to maximize profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit equation. We do this by taking the first derivative of the profit equation with respect to Q and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ/dQ = -4Q + 500\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for Q:\n\n-4Q + 500 = 0\n4Q = 500\nQ = 125\n\nNow that we have the optimal quantity, we can find the optimal price by plugging Q back into the demand equation:\n\nP = 1000 - 2(125)\nP = 1000 - 250\nP = $750\n\nSo, the optimal price to maximize profit is $750 per unit."
