    "message_2": "To find the dot product of vectors u = (3, 4) and v = (1, 2) using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere ||u|| and ||v|| are the magnitudes of vectors u and v, respectively, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n\n||u|| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n||v|| = √(1² + 2²) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| ||v||)\n\nTo find u · v, we can use the standard dot product formula:\n\nu · v = (3 * 1) + (4 * 2) = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = 11 / (5 * √5)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(11 / (5 * √5))\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the dot product using the trigonometric formula:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ) = 5 * √5 * cos(arccos(11 / (5 * √5)))\n\nu · v = 11\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors u and v is 11."
