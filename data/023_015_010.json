    "message_1": "A guitar string is plucked and vibrates at a frequency of 440 Hz. The wave propagates along the string with a speed of 100 meters per second. Which Fourier transform would be used to describe the wave propagation? Find the expression of the Fourier transform and the wave equation of the guitar string.",
    "message_2": "To describe the wave propagation of the guitar string, we would use the Fourier series representation. The Fourier series is used to represent periodic functions as a sum of sines and cosines. The wave equation of the guitar string can be represented as a solution to the 1D wave equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the wavelength and wave number of the wave. The frequency (f) is given as 440 Hz, and the wave speed (v) is 100 m/s.\n\nWavelength (λ) can be found using the formula: v = f * λ\n\nλ = v / f\nλ = 100 / 440\nλ ≈ 0.227 m\n\nNow, we can find the wave number (k) using the formula: k = 2π / λ\n\nk ≈ 2π / 0.227\nk ≈ 27.6 rad/m\n\nThe wave equation of the guitar string can be represented as:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the wave, x is the position along the string, t is the time, and ω is the angular frequency, which can be found using the formula: ω = 2πf\n\nω ≈ 2π * 440\nω ≈ 2764.6 rad/s\n\nSo, the wave equation of the guitar string is:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(27.6x - 2764.6t)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series representation of the wave. Since the wave is a sinusoidal function, its Fourier series representation will have only one term corresponding to the frequency of 440 Hz.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of the wave is:\n\nY(ω) = A * δ(ω - 2764.6)\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function, which is non-zero only when ω = 2764.6 rad/s, and A is the amplitude of the wave.\n\nIn conclusion, the wave equation of the guitar string is y(x, t) = A * sin(27.6x - 2764.6t), and its Fourier series representation is Y(ω) = A * δ(ω - 2764.6)."
