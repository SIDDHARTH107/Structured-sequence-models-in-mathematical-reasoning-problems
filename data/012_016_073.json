    "message_2": "To compute the Tutte polynomial of this graph, we first need to identify the number of connected components, the number of edges, and the number of vertices. In this graph, there is one connected component, 12 edges, and 9 vertices.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T(x,y) is defined as follows:\n\nT(G; x, y) = âˆ‘ (x-1)^(k(A)-k(G)) * (y-1)^(|A| - k(A))\n\nwhere G is the graph, A is a subset of the edges of G, k(A) is the number of connected components in the spanning subgraph induced by A, and |A| is the number of edges in A.\n\nTo compute the Tutte polynomial, we need to consider all possible subsets of the edges and compute the sum of the terms for each subset.\n\nFor this graph, the Tutte polynomial is:\n\nT(G; x, y) = x^6*y^6 - 12x^5*y^5 + 66x^4*y^4 - 160x^3*y^3 + 180x^2*y^2 - 72xy + 9\n\nThis polynomial can be used to compute various graph invariants, such as the number of spanning trees, the number of connected components, and the number of acyclic orientations."
