    "message_1": "In a study to determine the life expectancy of a certain species of bird, a researcher finds that out of a sample of 100 birds, 60 have died after an average of 5 years. What is the probability that a newly born bird of this species will survive for at least 6 years? Use Kaplan-Meier estimator to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that a newly born bird of this species will survive for at least 6 years using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we first need to determine the survival probabilities at each time point. In this case, we only have information about the birds that died after an average of 5 years.\n\nSince we don't have any information about the birds that survived beyond 5 years, we cannot calculate the survival probability at 6 years using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The Kaplan-Meier estimator requires information about the number of birds at risk and the number of events (deaths) at each time point.\n\nHowever, we can provide an estimate of the survival probability at 5 years, which can give us some insight into the survival of the birds.\n\nAt 5 years:\nNumber of birds at risk: 100\nNumber of events (deaths): 60\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator for the survival probability at 5 years is:\n\nS(5) = (Number of birds at risk - Number of events) / Number of birds at risk\nS(5) = (100 - 60) / 100\nS(5) = 40 / 100\nS(5) = 0.4\n\nSo, the probability that a newly born bird of this species will survive for at least 5 years is 0.4 or 40%. However, we cannot determine the probability of survival for at least 6 years using the given information."
