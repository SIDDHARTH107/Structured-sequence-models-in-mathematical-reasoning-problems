    "message_2": "To calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn this case, each side of the initial square is divided into 4 equal segments, so the scaling factor s = 4. The Vicsek fractal is formed by removing the central square and keeping the 4 corner squares and the 4 squares in the middle of the sides. Therefore, there are N = 8 self-similar pieces.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nD = log(8) / log(4)\nD â‰ˆ 1.893\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when each side of the initial square is divided into 4 equal segments and the process is repeated infinitely many times is approximately 1.893."
