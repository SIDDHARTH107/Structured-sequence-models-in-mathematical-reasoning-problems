    "message_1": "A radioactive element has a half-life of 20 days. If the initial mass of the element is 100 grams, what will be the amount of the element after 60 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 100 grams, the half-life is 20 days, and the time elapsed is 60 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/2)^(60 / 20)\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 60 days, there will be 12.5 grams of the radioactive element remaining."
