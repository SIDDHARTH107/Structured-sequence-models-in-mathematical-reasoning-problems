    "message_2": "We will use the Schwarz lemma for the upper half-plane to solve this problem. The Schwarz lemma states that if g(z) is an analytic function on the upper half-plane H, with g(H) ⊆ H and g(i) = i, then |g'(i)| ≤ 1 and |g(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ H.\n\nFirst, we define a new function g(z) = (f(z) - 2)/(f(z) - 1). Note that g(z) is analytic on the upper half-plane since f(z) is analytic and f(z) ≠ 1. Also, g(i) = (f(i) - 2)/(f(i) - 1) = (2 - 2)/(2 - 1) = 0, and g(H) ⊆ H.\n\nNow, we apply the Schwarz lemma to g(z). We have |g'(i)| ≤ 1. To find g'(i), we differentiate g(z) with respect to z:\n\ng'(z) = (f'(z)(f(z) - 1) - f'(z)(f(z) - 2))/((f(z) - 1)^2) = f'(z)/(f(z) - 1).\n\nThus, |f'(i)/(f(i) - 1)| ≤ 1, which implies |f'(i)| ≤ |f(i) - 1| = |2 - 1| = 1.\n\nNow, we will find an upper bound for |f(2i)|. Consider the function h(z) = (f(z) - 1)/(f(z) - 2). Note that h(z) is analytic on the upper half-plane, h(i) = i, and h(H) ⊆ H. Applying the Schwarz lemma to h(z), we have |h'(i)| ≤ 1. Differentiating h(z) with respect to z, we get:\n\nh'(z) = (f'(z)(f(z) - 2) - f'(z)(f(z) - 1))/((f(z) - 2)^2) = -f'(z)/(f(z) - 2).\n\nThus, |-f'(i)/(f(i) - 2)| ≤ 1, which implies |f'(i)| ≤ |f(i) - 2| = |2 - 2| = 0.\n\nSince |f'(i)| = 0, f(z) must be a constant function on the upper half-plane. Therefore, f(z) = 2 for all z ∈ H, and f(2i) = 2. The maximum value of f(2i) is 2."
