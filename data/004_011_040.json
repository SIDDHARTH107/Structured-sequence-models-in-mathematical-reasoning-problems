    "message_1": "A 10-foot ladder is leaning against a wall. If the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall? (Hint: use the Pythagorean theorem and related rates formula.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 feet long. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nWe are also given that the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second (dx/dt = 2). We want to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall (dy/dt) when x = 6.\n\nTo find dy/dt, we will differentiate the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\nWhen x = 6, we can find the value of y using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -24\n(dy/dt) = -24/16\n(dy/dt) = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 feet per second (negative sign indicates downward direction) when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall."
