    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 in the range [-10, 10].\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Number of nests (n) = 10\n- Discovery rate (Pa) = 0.25\n- Maximum number of iterations (Max_iter) = 100\n- Lower and upper bounds of x: lb = -10, ub = 10\n\nStep 2: Generate initial solutions (nests)\nGenerate 10 random solutions (nests) within the given range of x.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the fitness of the solutions\nCalculate the function value for each nest and store them.\n\nStep 4: Start the iterations\nFor each iteration, perform the following steps:\n\n  a) Generate a new solution (cuckoo) by using a random walk (Levy flight) and evaluate its fitness.\n  \n  b) Choose a random nest among the existing nests and compare the fitness of the cuckoo with the chosen nest. If the cuckoo's fitness is better, replace the nest with the cuckoo.\n  \n  c) With a probability Pa, choose a fraction of the worst nests and replace them with new random solutions.\n  \n  d) Evaluate the fitness of the new nests and update the best solution found so far.\n  \n  e) Continue the iterations until the maximum number of iterations (Max_iter) is reached.\n\nStep 5: Return the best solution\nAfter completing the iterations, return the best solution (nest) found.\n\nBy applying the Cuckoo Search Algorithm, we can find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 in the range [-10, 10]. However, it is important to note that the algorithm may not always find the exact minimum value due to its stochastic nature. The more iterations and nests used, the higher the probability of finding the true minimum value."
