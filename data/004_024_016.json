    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the implicit function 3x^2 + 4xy + 2y^3 = 10 with respect to x, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nFirst, let's differentiate each term with respect to x:\n\n1. Differentiate 3x^2 with respect to x: d(3x^2)/dx = 6x\n2. Differentiate 4xy with respect to x: d(4xy)/dx = 4y + 4x(dy/dx) (using the product rule and chain rule)\n3. Differentiate 2y^3 with respect to x: d(2y^3)/dx = 6y^2(dy/dx) (using the chain rule)\n4. Differentiate 10 with respect to x: d(10)/dx = 0\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n6x + 4y + 4x(dy/dx) + 6y^2(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n4x(dy/dx) + 6y^2(dy/dx) = -6x - 4y\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx (4x + 6y^2) = -6x - 4y\n\nNow, divide both sides by (4x + 6y^2) to solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (-6x - 4y) / (4x + 6y^2)"
