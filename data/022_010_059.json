    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = e^(2z)/(z-1)^2 at the point z=1, we first need to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(2z) and then divide it by (z-1)^2.\n\nThe Taylor series expansion of e^(2z) is given by:\n\ne^(2z) = Σ (2z)^n / n! , where the sum is from n=0 to infinity.\n\nNow, we need to divide this series by (z-1)^2:\n\nf(z) = e^(2z) / (z-1)^2 = [Σ (2z)^n / n!] / (z-1)^2\n\nTo find the Laurent series expansion, we can perform long division or use the Cauchy product formula. We will use the Cauchy product formula here.\n\nLet g(z) = 1 / (z-1)^2. Then, the Laurent series expansion of g(z) is given by:\n\ng(z) = Σ a_n (z-1)^n , where the sum is from n=-2 to infinity, and a_n = 0 for n ≠ -2, a_{-2} = 1.\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) using the Cauchy product formula:\n\nf(z) = e^(2z) * g(z) = Σ Σ (2z)^n / n! * a_m (z-1)^m\n\nSince a_n = 0 for n ≠ -2, the only term that contributes to the sum is when m = -2:\n\nf(z) = Σ (2z)^n / n! * (z-1)^{-2}\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n\nf(z) = Σ (2z)^n / n! * (1 / (z-1)^2)\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) at the point z=1.\n\nNow, let's find the radius of convergence. Since the function e^(2z) has an infinite radius of convergence and g(z) has a radius of convergence of 1 (centered at z=1), the radius of convergence of f(z) will be the minimum of the two, which is 1.\n\nSo, the radius of convergence of the Laurent series expansion of f(z) at the point z=1 is 1."
