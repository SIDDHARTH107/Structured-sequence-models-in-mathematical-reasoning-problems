    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the proposition \"Today is Monday and it is raining outside,\" we need to look at the conjunction of P and Q, which is represented as P ∧ Q. \n\nIn this case, we know that P is true (Today is Monday) and Q is false (It is not raining outside). The conjunction P ∧ Q is true only if both P and Q are true. Since Q is false, the conjunction P ∧ Q is also false.\n\nSo, the truth value of the proposition \"Today is Monday and it is raining outside\" is false."
