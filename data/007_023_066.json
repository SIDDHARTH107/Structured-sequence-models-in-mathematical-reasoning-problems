    "message_2": "To compute the SHA-256 hash of the message \"Hello, world!\", you can use a programming language or an online tool. Here's the hash:\n\n`315f5bdb76d078c43b8ac0064e4a0164612b1fce77c869345bfc94c75894edd3`\n\nKeep in mind that the hash is case-sensitive, so \"Hello, world!\" will produce a different hash than \"hello, world!\" or \"HELLO, WORLD!\"."
