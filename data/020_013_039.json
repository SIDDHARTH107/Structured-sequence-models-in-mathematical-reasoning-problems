    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: product A and product B. Each unit of product A requires 3 labor hours and 2 machine hours, while each unit of product B requires 2 labor hours and 2 machine hours. The factory has 200 labor hours and 150 machine hours available each day. The profit per unit of product A is $10, and the profit per unit of product B is $8. How many units of product A and product B should the factory produce each day to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced each day. We have the following constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 200 (labor hours constraint)\n2x + 2y ≤ 150 (machine hours constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 8y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the machine hours constraint:\n\n2x + 2y ≤ 150\nx + y ≤ 75\n\nNow we can find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 0) - If the factory produces no units of either product.\n2. (0, 75) - If the factory produces only product B and uses all machine hours.\n3. (50, 0) - If the factory produces only product A and uses all machine hours.\n4. (40, 20) - If the factory produces both products and uses all labor and machine hours. This is found by solving the system of equations:\n\n3x + 2y = 200\nx + y = 75\n\nNow we can evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 75) = 10(0) + 8(75) = $600\n3. P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 8(0) = $500\n4. P(40, 20) = 10(40) + 8(20) = $640\n\nThe maximum profit is $640, which occurs when the factory produces 40 units of product A and 20 units of product B each day."
