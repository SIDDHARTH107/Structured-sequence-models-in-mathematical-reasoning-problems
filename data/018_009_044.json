    "message_2": "To verify that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C), we will compute both sides of the equation and compare the results.\n\nFirst, let's compute (A × B) × C:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, (A × B) × C = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 4), 7), ((1, 5), 6), ((1, 5), 7), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 4), 7), ((2, 5), 6), ((2, 5), 7), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 4), 7), ((3, 5), 6), ((3, 5), 7)}\n\nNext, let's compute A × (B × C):\n\nB × C = {(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}\n\nNow, A × (B × C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (4, 7)), (1, (5, 6)), (1, (5, 7)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (4, 7)), (2, (5, 6)), (2, (5, 7)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (4, 7)), (3, (5, 6)), (3, (5, 7))}\n\nNow, we can rewrite the elements of A × (B × C) to match the format of (A × B) × C:\n\nA × (B × C) = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 4), 7), ((1, 5), 6), ((1, 5), 7), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 4), 7), ((2, 5), 6), ((2, 5), 7), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 4), 7), ((3, 5), 6), ((3, 5), 7)}\n\nComparing the results, we can see that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C). Therefore, the associative property of Cartesian products holds for these sets."
