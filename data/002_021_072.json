    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector of the circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) * π * 8^2\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) * π * 64\n\nArea of sector = 64π/6\n\nArea of sector = 32π/3\n\nTherefore, the area of the sector of the circle is (32π/3) square centimeters."
