    "message_1": "A circular pizza has a radius of 10 inches. If you cut out a sector of the pizza that measures 60°, what is the area of the pizza sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the pizza sector, we can use the formula for the area of a sector:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360°) * π * r²\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60° and the radius (r) is 10 inches.\n\nArea of sector = (60° / 360°) * π * (10 inches)²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) * π * 100 square inches\n\nArea of sector = (100/6) * π square inches\n\nArea of sector ≈ 16.67 * π square inches\n\nArea of sector ≈ 52.36 square inches\n\nSo, the area of the pizza sector is approximately 52.36 square inches."
