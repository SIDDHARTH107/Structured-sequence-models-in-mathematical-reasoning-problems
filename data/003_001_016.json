    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using trigonometry, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). In equation form, this is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this case, we are given the lengths of two sides: a = 12 cm and b = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc² = (12 cm)² + (8 cm)²\nc² = 144 cm² + 64 cm²\nc² = 208 cm²\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nc = √(208 cm²)\nc ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is approximately 14.42 cm."
