    "message_2": "The cardinality of the set of real numbers is the same in both first-order and second-order logic. The cardinality of the set of real numbers is uncountably infinite, which is represented by the cardinality of the continuum, denoted as |ℝ| or ℵ1 (aleph-one). This cardinality is larger than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers (ℵ0) and is also equal to the cardinality of the set of all subsets of natural numbers (the power set of ℕ)."
