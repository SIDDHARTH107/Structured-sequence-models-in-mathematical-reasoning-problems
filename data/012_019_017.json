    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color. In other words, it is the minimum number of colors required for a proper edge coloring.\n\nFor the given graph, we can color the edges as follows:\n\n1. Color the top horizontal edge red.\n2. Color the left vertical edge blue.\n3. Color the right vertical edge green.\n4. Color the bottom horizontal edge red.\n5. Color the diagonal edge from the top-left vertex to the bottom-right vertex blue.\n6. Color the diagonal edge from the top-right vertex to the bottom-left vertex green.\n\nWith this coloring, no two adjacent edges have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of this graph is 3."
