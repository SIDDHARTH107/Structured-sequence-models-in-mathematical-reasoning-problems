    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6]], X = [[x], [y], [z]], and B = [[6], [20], [35]].\n\nNow, let's find the LU decomposition of matrix A:\n\n1. L = [[1, 0, 0], [l21, 1, 0], [l31, l32, 1]]\n   U = [[u11, u12, u13], [0, u22, u23], [0, 0, u33]]\n\n2. For the first row of U, we have:\n   u11 = 1, u12 = 1, u13 = 1\n\n3. For the second row of L and U, we have:\n   l21 = 2, u22 = 1, u23 = 2\n   (l21 = 2 is obtained from the second row of A by dividing the first element by u11)\n\n4. For the third row of L and U, we have:\n   l31 = 4, l32 = 1, u33 = 2\n   (l31 = 4 is obtained from the third row of A by dividing the first element by u11, and l32 = 1 is obtained by dividing the second element of the third row of A minus l31 * u12 by u22)\n\nNow, we have L and U as follows:\n\nL = [[1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0], [4, 1, 1]]\nU = [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 2]]\n\nNext, we solve the system L * Y = B for Y:\n\n1. y1 = 6\n2. y2 = 20 - 2 * y1 = 8\n3. y3 = 35 - 4 * y1 - y2 = 2\n\nSo, Y = [[6], [8], [2]].\n\nFinally, we solve the system U * X = Y for X:\n\n1. z = y3 / u33 = 2 / 2 = 1\n2. y = (y2 - u23 * z) / u22 = (8 - 2 * 1) / 1 = 6\n3. x = (y1 - u12 * y - u13 * z) / u11 = (6 - 1 * 6 - 1 * 1) / 1 = -1\n\nThus, the solution of the given system of linear equations is x = -1, y = 6, and z = 1."
