    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity function v(t):\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(2t^3 - 3t^2 + 6t)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = 6t^2 - 6t + 6\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 2 seconds. Plug t = 2 into the velocity function:\n\nv(2) = 6(2)^2 - 6(2) + 6\nv(2) = 6(4) - 12 + 6\nv(2) = 24 - 12 + 6\nv(2) = 18\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at t = 2 seconds is 18 meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t, which is the first derivative of the velocity function v(t):\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t^2 - 6t + 6)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 12t - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at t = 2 seconds. Plug t = 2 into the acceleration function:\n\na(2) = 12(2) - 6\na(2) = 24 - 6\na(2) = 18\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at t = 2 seconds is 18 meters per second squared.\n\nIn conclusion, at t = 2 seconds, the car has a velocity of 18 meters per second and an acceleration of 18 meters per second squared."
