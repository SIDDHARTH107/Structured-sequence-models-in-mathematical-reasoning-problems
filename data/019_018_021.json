    "message_2": "The statement is incorrect. The sum of four consecutive odd integers starting from 1 is not always equal to 16. Let's consider the first four consecutive odd integers starting from 1:\n\n1, 3, 5, 7\n\nThe sum of these integers is:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16\n\nHowever, if we consider the next set of four consecutive odd integers starting from the next odd integer after 1, which is 3:\n\n3, 5, 7, 9\n\nThe sum of these integers is:\n\n3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24\n\nAs we can see, the sum of four consecutive odd integers starting from 1 is 16, but the sum of the next set of four consecutive odd integers is 24. Therefore, the statement that the sum of four consecutive odd integers starting from 1 is always equal to 16 is incorrect."
