This minimum number of colors required is known as the chromatic index of the graph.",
    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the given graph, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Identify the vertex with the highest degree. In this case, vertex 1 has the highest degree with 4 edges connected to it.\n2. Color the edges connected to the vertex with the highest degree using different colors. In this case, we need 4 colors for the edges connected to vertex 1.\n3. Now, color the remaining edges while ensuring that no two adjacent edges have the same color. \n\nHere's one possible coloring of the edges:\n\n```\n    1 ---- 2\n   /|\\     |\\\n  6 | \\4   | \\5\n   \\|/     |/\n    3 ---- 4\n        ￣￣\n```\n\nColoring:\n```\n    1 -1- 2\n   /|\\     |\\\n  6 |2\\4   3\\5\n   \\|/     |/\n    3 -1- 4\n        ￣￣\n```\n\nIn this coloring, we used 4 colors (1, 2, 3, and 4) and no two adjacent edges have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the given graph is 4."
