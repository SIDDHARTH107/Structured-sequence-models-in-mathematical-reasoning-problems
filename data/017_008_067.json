Show that every group of order 8 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4, by using the structures of the subgroups.",
    "message_2": "A group of order 8 has the prime factorization 8 = 2^3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 2^3 = 8) must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, there can be 1 or 4 Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 8.\n\nNow let's consider the structures of these subgroups. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal, and the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8. If there are four Sylow 2-subgroups, we can analyze their structures to determine if the group is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8 or the dihedral group D4.\n\nLet G be a group of order 8 with four Sylow 2-subgroups. Let H be one of these subgroups. Since |H| = 8, H must contain an element of order 4 (by Cauchy's theorem). Let x be an element of order 4 in H. Then H = {e, x, x^2, x^3}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow consider the other three Sylow 2-subgroups. Each of them must also contain an element of order 4. Since there are only three elements of order 4 in G (x, x^3, and an element from another Sylow 2-subgroup), one of these subgroups must contain x^3. Let K be the subgroup containing x^3. Then K = {e, x^3, y, yx^3}, where y is an element of order 2.\n\nNow we have two cases to consider:\n\n1. If yx^3 = x^2, then G is generated by x and y, and the relations x^4 = y^2 = (xy)^2 = e hold. This is the presentation of the dihedral group D4, so G is isomorphic to D4.\n\n2. If yx^3 â‰  x^2, then yx^3 = x or yx^3 = x^3. Without loss of generality, assume yx^3 = x. Then G is generated by x and y, and the relations x^4 = y^2 = e and yx = x^3y hold. This is the presentation of the quaternion group Q8, so G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 8 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4, depending on the structures of their subgroups."
