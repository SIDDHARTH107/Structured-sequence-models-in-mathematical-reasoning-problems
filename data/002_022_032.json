    "message_1": "What is the volume of a torus with a major radius of 10 cm and a minor radius of 4 cm?",
    "message_2": "The volume of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the radius of the circular cross-section of the torus, and major_radius is the distance from the center of the circular cross-section to the center of the torus.\n\nGiven a major radius of 10 cm and a minor radius of 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * 4^2) * (2 * π * 10)\nVolume = (π * 16) * (20 * π)\nVolume = 320 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 320π^2 cubic centimeters, which is approximately 1005.31 cubic centimeters."
