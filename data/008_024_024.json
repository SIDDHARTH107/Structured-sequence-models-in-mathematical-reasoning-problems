    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we can see that the second equation is just half of the first equation. So, we can use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the second equation by multiplying it by 2:\n\n2(x + 2y) = 2(5)\n2x + 4y = 10\n\nNow we have:\n\n2x + 4y = 10 (Equation 1)\n2x + 4y = 10 (Equation 2)\n\nSince both equations are the same, we can eliminate one of them:\n\n2x + 4y = 10\n\nNow let's solve for y:\n\n4y = 10 - 2x\ny = (10 - 2x) / 4\ny = 5/2 - x/2\n\nSince there is no unique solution for x and y, the system of linear equations has multiple solutions. The solutions can be represented as:\n\nx = x\ny = 5/2 - x/2\n\nFor any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y using the equation above. This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions along a line."
