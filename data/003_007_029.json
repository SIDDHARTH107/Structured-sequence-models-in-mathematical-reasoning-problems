    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 10 in this case. Let's denote the angle opposite the side of length 10 as C. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle. In this case, a = 7, b = 9, and c = 10. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n10² = 7² + 9² - 2 * 7 * 9 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 49 + 81 - 126 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 130 - 126 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (130 - 100) / 126\n\ncos(C) = 30 / 126\n\ncos(C) = 1/4.2\n\nNow, we can find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(1/4.2)\n\nC ≈ 75.5 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 76 degrees."
