Otherwise, show that G must contain at least one normal subgroup of order 16 and another normal subgroup of order 3, and hence G is isomorphic to either A4 × C4 or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.",
    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nCase 1: G contains an element of order 48.\n\nLet x be an element of order 48 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by x, denoted by <x>, has order 48. Since the order of <x> is equal to the order of G, we have <x> = G. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 48, and it is isomorphic to C48.\n\nCase 2: G does not contain an element of order 48.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorem, we know that there exists a Sylow 16-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 16-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup. The number of Sylow 16-subgroups is equal to n_16, which divides 48/16 = 3, and n_16 is congruent to 1 modulo 16. Thus, n_16 can be either 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is equal to n_3, which divides 48/3 = 16, and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16.\n\nIf n_16 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 16-subgroup, which is normal in G. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is also normal in G. In this case, G must contain at least one normal subgroup of order 16 and another normal subgroup of order 3.\n\nNow, we have |P| = 16 and |Q| = 3, and since gcd(16, 3) = 1, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1. By the product formula, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 16 * 3 = 48. Thus, G = PQ. Since P and Q are both normal in G, G is a semidirect product of P and Q. \n\nThere are 15 possible groups of order 48 that can be formed as a semidirect product of P and Q. One of them is the direct product A4 × C4, which is abelian. The other 14 groups are non-abelian. Therefore, if G does not contain an element of order 48, it must be isomorphic to either A4 × C4 or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48."
