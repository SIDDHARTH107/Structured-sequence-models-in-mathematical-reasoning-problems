    "message_2": "A complex torus is a compact Riemann surface obtained by taking the quotient of the complex plane by a lattice Λ. In this case, the lattice Λ is generated by 1 and i. The space of holomorphic 1-forms on a complex torus is isomorphic to the space of holomorphic 1-forms on the complex plane that are invariant under translations by the lattice Λ.\n\nLet ω be a holomorphic 1-form on the complex plane. In order for ω to be invariant under translations by the lattice Λ, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\nω(z + 1) = ω(z) and ω(z + i) = ω(z) for all z in the complex plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the space of holomorphic 1-forms on the complex plane. A general holomorphic 1-form can be written as ω = f(z)dz, where f(z) is a holomorphic function. The invariance conditions can be rewritten as:\n\nf(z + 1) = f(z) and f(z + i) = f(z) for all z in the complex plane.\n\nThese conditions imply that f(z) is a doubly periodic function with periods 1 and i, which means f(z) is an elliptic function. However, the only elliptic function that is holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane is the constant function. Therefore, the space of holomorphic 1-forms on the complex torus obtained by taking the quotient of the complex plane by the lattice generated by 1 and i is one-dimensional, spanned by the constant 1-form dz."
