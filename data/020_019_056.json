The production cost per unit is $50 for the first 100 units and $60 for each unit thereafter. The company also incurs an inventory holding cost of $5 per unit per day. The demand for the product is assumed to be constant at 250 units per day. Determine the optimal production quantity and inventory level that will minimize the total cost of production and inventory holding for the company.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the optimal production quantity as Q and the inventory level as I. The total cost of production and inventory holding can be expressed as the sum of the production cost and the inventory holding cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the production cost. For the first 100 units, the cost is $50 per unit, and for the remaining (Q - 100) units, the cost is $60 per unit. So, the total production cost (PC) can be expressed as:\n\nPC = 50 * 100 + 60 * (Q - 100)\n\nNext, let's calculate the inventory holding cost (IHC). The inventory level I is the difference between the production quantity Q and the demand of 250 units per day. The holding cost is $5 per unit per day. So, the total inventory holding cost can be expressed as:\n\nIHC = 5 * I = 5 * (Q - 250)\n\nNow, we need to minimize the total cost (TC), which is the sum of the production cost and the inventory holding cost:\n\nTC = PC + IHC = (50 * 100 + 60 * (Q - 100)) + (5 * (Q - 250))\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity Q, we need to find the minimum value of the total cost function TC. We can do this by taking the derivative of TC with respect to Q and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(TC)/dQ = 0\n\nLet's first simplify the TC equation:\n\nTC = 5000 + 60Q - 6000 + 5Q - 1250\nTC = 5Q + 55Q - 7250\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of TC with respect to Q:\n\nd(TC)/dQ = 5 + 55\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and does not depend on Q, the total cost function is linear, and there is no minimum value for the total cost in this case. This means that the company should produce exactly 250 units per day to meet the demand and avoid any inventory holding costs. In this case, the optimal production quantity Q is 250 units, and the inventory level I is 0."
