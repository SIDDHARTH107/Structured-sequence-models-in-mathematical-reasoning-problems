    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nB = {3, 6, 9}\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\nA ∩ B = {6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A Δ B):\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10} - {6} = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A (B Δ A):\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {3, 2, 6, 4, 9, 8, 10} - {6} = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, A Δ B = B Δ A = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10}. Therefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is equal to the symmetric difference of B and A."
