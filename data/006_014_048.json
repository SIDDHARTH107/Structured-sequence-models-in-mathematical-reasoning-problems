    "message_1": "A certain type of technological failure occurs in a system with probability 0.2. If the system consists of 5 independent components, what is the probability that at least 1 component fails?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 1 component fails, it's easier to find the probability that none of the components fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component does not fail is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince the components are independent, the probability that all 5 components do not fail is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(all components do not fail) = 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least 1 component fails, we subtract the probability that none of them fail from 1:\n\nP(at least 1 component fails) = 1 - P(all components do not fail) = 1 - 0.32768 = 0.67232\n\nSo, the probability that at least 1 component fails is 0.67232."
