    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1 meter has an initial temperature of 100°C. At time t=0, a constant temperature of 50°C is applied to one end of the rod while the other end remains insulated. The rod has a thermal conductivity of 100 J/m*s and a cross-sectional area of 0.01 m^2. Find the temperature distribution along the rod at a time t=50s using the one-dimensional heat equation.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the rod at a time t=50s, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity. The thermal diffusivity can be calculated using the formula:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c_p)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density of the material, and c_p is the specific heat capacity. However, since we are not given the density and specific heat capacity of the material, we will assume that the thermal diffusivity is constant along the rod.\n\nTo solve the heat equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x) * T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = α * X''(x) * T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by α * X(x) * T(t), we get:\n\n(T'(t) / (α * T(t))) = (X''(x) / X(x))\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\nT'(t) / (α * T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT'(t) = -α * λ² * T(t)\nX''(x) = -λ² * X(x)\n\nSolving the second equation for X(x), we get:\n\nX(x) = A * cos(λ * x) + B * sin(λ * x)\n\nSince the end of the rod at x=0 is held at a constant temperature of 50°C, we have the boundary condition:\n\nX(0) = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) = A = 50\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues λ and the corresponding eigenfunctions X(x). Since the other end of the rod is insulated, we have the boundary condition:\n\nX'(1) = -λ * A * sin(λ * 1) + λ * B * cos(λ * 1) = 0\n\nPlugging in A = 50, we get:\n\n-50λ * sin(λ) + λ * B * cos(λ) = 0\n\nSince λ ≠ 0, we can divide by λ and rearrange the equation to get:\n\nB * cos(λ) = 50 * sin(λ)\n\nSince cos(λ) ≠ 0, we can divide by cos(λ) and get:\n\nB = 50 * tan(λ)\n\nThe eigenvalues λ and the corresponding eigenfunctions X(x) can be found by solving the transcendental equation:\n\ntan(λ) = 50 * sin(λ) / cos(λ)\n\nHowever, this equation does not have a closed-form solution, so we will need to use numerical methods to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\n\nOnce we have the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we can use the method of superposition to find the temperature distribution along the rod:\n\nT(x, t) = 50 + ∑[C_n * e^(-α * λ_n² * t) * sin(λ_n * x)]\n\nwhere C_n are the coefficients that can be found using the initial condition T(x, 0) = 100°C.\n\nFinally, we can plug in t=50s and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions we found earlier to find the temperature distribution along the rod at a time t=50s."
