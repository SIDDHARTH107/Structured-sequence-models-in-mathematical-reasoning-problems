    "message_2": "The quasi-Newton method is an optimization algorithm for finding the local minimum of a function. It is an iterative method that uses an approximation of the Hessian matrix to update the search point. However, for a single-variable function like the one given, we can use the simpler Newton-Raphson method to find the critical points (where the derivative is zero), and then determine if it is a local minimum by checking the second derivative.\n\nFirst, we find the first and second derivatives of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 30x + 36\nf''(x) = 12x - 30\n\nNow, we apply the Newton-Raphson method to find the critical points. The update rule for the Newton-Raphson method is:\n\nx_new = x_old - f'(x_old) / f''(x_old)\n\nWe start with an initial guess within the interval [0, 4]. Let's choose x0 = 2.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0)\nx1 = 2 - (6(2)^2 - 30(2) + 36) / (12(2) - 30)\nx1 = 2 - (48 - 60 + 36) / (-6)\nx1 = 2 + 24 / 6\nx1 = 2 + 4\nx1 = 6\n\nThe new value, x1 = 6, is outside the interval [0, 4]. In this case, we can use the bisection method to find a better initial guess. Let's choose the midpoint of the interval, x0 = (0 + 4) / 2 = 2.\n\nIteration 1 (with bisection):\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0)\nx1 = 2 - (6(2)^2 - 30(2) + 36) / (12(2) - 30)\nx1 = 2 - (48 - 60 + 36) / (-6)\nx1 = 2 + 24 / 6\nx1 = 2 + 4\nx1 = 6\n\nAgain, we get x1 = 6, which is outside the interval. In this case, we can try another approach, such as the golden section search or the bisection method, to find the critical points within the interval.\n\nHowever, we can also check the endpoints of the interval to see if they are local minima. We do this by evaluating the second derivative at the endpoints:\n\nf''(0) = 12(0) - 30 = -30\nf''(4) = 12(4) - 30 = 18\n\nSince f''(0) < 0, the function is concave down at x = 0, which means it is a local maximum. On the other hand, f''(4) > 0, which means the function is concave up at x = 4, indicating a local minimum. Therefore, the local minimum within the interval [0, 4] occurs at x = 4."
