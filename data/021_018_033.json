    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to Solving optimization problems using tabu search:\n\nA company needs to transport 500 units of product from three warehouses to three customers. Each warehouse has a fixed capacity and each customer has a fixed demand. The transportation costs from each warehouse to each customer are given in the following table:\n\n|        | Customer 1 | Customer 2 | Customer 3 |\n|--------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Warehouse 1 | 2          | 7          | 8          |\n| Warehouse 2 | 5          | 3          | 6          |\n| Warehouse 3 | 4          | 1          | 9          |\n\nEach warehouse can only transport a maximum of 300 units of product, and each customer must receive their entire demand. Use tabu search to determine the optimal transportation plan that minimizes the total transportation cost.\n\nWhat is the optimal transportation plan and what is the minimum total transportation cost?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function is the total transportation cost, which we want to minimize.\n2. Define the neighborhood: The neighborhood consists of all possible transportation plans that can be obtained by changing the amount of product transported from one warehouse to another.\n3. Define the tabu list: The tabu list will store the recent solutions to avoid cycling and encourage exploration of new solutions.\n4. Define the stopping criteria: The stopping criteria can be a fixed number of iterations or when no improvement is observed for a certain number of iterations.\n\nNow, let's perform the tabu search:\n\n1. Initialize the solution: We can start with an initial solution, for example:\n   - Warehouse 1: 200 units to Customer 1, 100 units to Customer 2\n   - Warehouse 2: 100 units to Customer 2, 200 units to Customer 3\n   - Warehouse 3: 200 units to Customer 1, 100 units to Customer 3\n\n2. Calculate the total transportation cost for the initial solution:\n   - Cost = (200 * 2) + (100 * 7) + (100 * 3) + (200 * 6) + (200 * 4) + (100 * 9) = 400 + 700 + 300 + 1200 + 800 + 900 = 4300\n\n3. Generate the neighborhood solutions and calculate their costs. For example, we can move 100 units from Warehouse 1 to Customer 3 and 100 units from Warehouse 3 to Customer 2:\n   - New solution: \n     - Warehouse 1: 200 units to Customer 1, 100 units to Customer 3\n     - Warehouse 2: 100 units to Customer 2, 200 units to Customer 3\n     - Warehouse 3: 200 units to Customer 1, 100 units to Customer 2\n   - New cost = (200 * 2) + (100 * 8) + (100 * 3) + (200 * 6) + (200 * 4) + (100 * 1) = 400 + 800 + 300 + 1200 + 800 + 100 = 3600\n\n4. Update the tabu list and select the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list. In this case, the new solution has a lower cost, so we update the current solution and add the previous solution to the tabu list.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the stopping criteria are met. In this case, we can stop since we have found an optimal solution.\n\nThe optimal transportation plan is:\n- Warehouse 1: 200 units to Customer 1, 100 units to Customer 3\n- Warehouse 2: 100 units to Customer 2, 200 units to Customer 3\n- Warehouse 3: 200 units to Customer 1, 100 units to Customer 2\n\nThe minimum total transportation cost is 3600."
