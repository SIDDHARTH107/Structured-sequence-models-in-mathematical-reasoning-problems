    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X, L), we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a smooth projective curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nh⁰(X, L) - h¹(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nHere, h⁰(X, L) is the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X, L), h¹(X, L) is the dimension of the space of global sections H¹(X, L), and deg(L) is the degree of the line bundle L.\n\nIn our case, we have g = 3 and deg(L) = 4. To compute h¹(X, L), we can use the Serre duality theorem, which states that:\n\nh¹(X, L) = h⁰(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1))\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical bundle on X. For a smooth projective curve of genus g, the canonical bundle K_X has degree 2g - 2, so in our case, deg(K_X) = 2(3) - 2 = 4.\n\nNow, L^(-1) is the dual of L, and it has degree -deg(L) = -4. Thus, K_X ⊗ L^(-1) is a line bundle of degree deg(K_X) - deg(L) = 4 - 4 = 0.\n\nSince the degree of K_X ⊗ L^(-1) is 0, it has no global sections, i.e., h⁰(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1)) = 0. Therefore, by Serre duality, we have h¹(X, L) = 0.\n\nNow, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute h⁰(X, L):\n\nh⁰(X, L) - h¹(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\nh⁰(X, L) - 0 = 4 + 1 - 3\nh⁰(X, L) = 2\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X, L) is 2."
