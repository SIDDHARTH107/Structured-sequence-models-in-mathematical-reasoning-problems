    "message_1": "A company produces computer chips, and it is known that 8% of the chips are defective. A sample of 150 chips is taken, and the number of defective chips is recorded. What is the probability that there are exactly 10 defective chips in the sample, according to Bayesian statistics?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective chips in the sample\n- n is the total number of chips in the sample (150 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective chips (10 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a chip being defective (0.08 in this case)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) = (150C10) * (0.08^10) * (1-0.08)^(150-10)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 150C10:\n\n150C10 = 150! / (10!(150-10)!)\n= 150! / (10!140!)\n= 5,727,882,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the other parts of the formula:\n\n(0.08^10) = 1.073741824 * 10^(-10)\n(1-0.08)^(150-10) = 0.92^140 = 1.123587 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = 5,727,882,000 * (1.073741824 * 10^(-10)) * (1.123587 * 10^(-6))\nP(X = 10) â‰ˆ 0.0701\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 10 defective chips in the sample of 150 chips is approximately 7.01%."
