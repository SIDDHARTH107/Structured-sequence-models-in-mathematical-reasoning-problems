The derivative of 3x³ with respect to x:\n   (3)(3)x^(3-1) = 9x²\n\n2. The derivative of 7x² with respect to x:\n   (2)(7)x^(2-1) = 14x\n\n3. The derivative of -5x with respect to x:\n   (-5)x^(1-1) = -5\n\n4. The derivative of the constant term 9 with respect to x is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 9x² + 14x - 5"
