Each bidder has a different valuation for the painting as follows: \n\nBidder 1: $2,000 \n\nBidder 2: $3,500 \n\nBidder 3: $5,000 \n\nBidder 4: $6,500 \n\nBidder 5: $8,000 \n\nAssuming the auction follows the second-price sealed-bid auction format (also known as a Vickrey auction), in which the highest bidder wins the item, but only pays the second-highest bid, what would be the winning bid and which bidder would win the painting in this auction?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the item but pays the second-highest bid. In this case, the bids are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $2,000\nBidder 2: $3,500\nBidder 3: $5,000\nBidder 4: $6,500\nBidder 5: $8,000\n\nThe highest bid is $8,000 from Bidder 5, so Bidder 5 would win the painting. The second-highest bid is $6,500 from Bidder 4. Therefore, Bidder 5 would pay $6,500 for the painting."
