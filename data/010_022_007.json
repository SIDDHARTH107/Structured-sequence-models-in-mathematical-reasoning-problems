    "message_2": "Let's denote the center of the sphere as point C and the tangent point as point T. The coordinates of the center of the sphere C are (0, 0, 0) since it is not mentioned that the sphere is shifted from the origin. The coordinates of the tangent point T are (-1, 2, -2).\n\nThe vector CT can be found by subtracting the coordinates of point C from point T:\n\nCT = T - C = (-1 - 0, 2 - 0, -2 - 0) = (-1, 2, -2)\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the plane containing the line and the center of the sphere. The normal vector of the plane is the same as the vector CT, which is (-1, 2, -2). Let's denote the coordinates of a point on the plane as (x, y, z). The equation of the plane can be written as:\n\nA(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) are the components of the normal vector, and (x0, y0, z0) is a point on the plane. We can use the tangent point T as the point on the plane:\n\n-1(x - (-1)) + 2(y - 2) - 2(z - (-2)) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-1(x + 1) + 2(y - 2) - 2(z + 2) = 0\n\n-1x - 1 + 2y - 4 - 2z - 4 = 0\n\n-1x + 2y - 2z - 9 = 0\n\nThe equation of the plane containing the line and the center of the sphere is:\n\nx - 2y + 2z + 9 = 0"
