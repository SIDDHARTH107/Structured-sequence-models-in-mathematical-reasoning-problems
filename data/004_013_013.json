    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8 on the interval [0, 5], we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n2. Check the endpoints of the interval.\n3. Compare the function values at the critical points and the endpoints to determine the maximum and minimum values.\n\nStep 1: Find the critical points\nf'(x) = 2x - 6\nSet f'(x) = 0:\n2x - 6 = 0\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nSo, there is one critical point at x = 3.\n\nStep 2: Check the endpoints of the interval\nEvaluate the function at the endpoints:\nf(0) = (0)^2 - 6(0) + 8 = 8\nf(5) = (5)^2 - 6(5) + 8 = 25 - 30 + 8 = 3\n\nStep 3: Compare the function values at the critical points and the endpoints\nEvaluate the function at the critical point:\nf(3) = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 8 = 9 - 18 + 8 = -1\n\nNow, compare the function values:\nf(0) = 8\nf(3) = -1\nf(5) = 3\n\nThe maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 5] is 8, which occurs at x = 0.\nThe minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 5] is -1, which occurs at x = 3."
