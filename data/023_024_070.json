The function f(x) is defined over the range -π to π, and it's a piecewise function. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ(aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx))\n\nwhere the coefficients are given by:\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\naₙ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x)cos(nx) dx\nbₙ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] f(x)sin(nx) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) [∫[-π, -π/2] 0 dx + ∫[-π/2, π/2] 1 dx + ∫[π/2, π] 0 dx]\na₀ = (1/π) [0 + (π/2 - (-π/2)) + 0]\na₀ = (1/π) * π\na₀ = 1\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) [∫[-π, -π/2] 0*cos(nx) dx + ∫[-π/2, π/2] 1*cos(nx) dx + ∫[π/2, π] 0*cos(nx) dx]\naₙ = (1/π) [0 + ∫[-π/2, π/2] cos(nx) dx + 0]\naₙ = (1/π) [(1/n)sin(nx) | from -π/2 to π/2]\naₙ = (1/π) [(1/n)(sin(nπ/2) - sin(-nπ/2))]\naₙ = (2/πn)(sin(nπ/2))\n\nFinally, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) [∫[-π, -π/2] 0*sin(nx) dx + ∫[-π/2, π/2] 1*sin(nx) dx + ∫[π/2, π] 0*sin(nx) dx]\nbₙ = (1/π) [0 + ∫[-π/2, π/2] sin(nx) dx + 0]\nbₙ = (1/π) [(-1/n)cos(nx) | from -π/2 to π/2]\nbₙ = (1/π) [(-1/n)(cos(nπ/2) - cos(-nπ/2))]\nbₙ = (2/πn)(-cos(nπ/2))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = 1 + Σ((2/πn)(sin(nπ/2))cos(nx) + (2/πn)(-cos(nπ/2))sin(nx))\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) over the range of -π to π."
