    "message_2": "To show that $C$ is isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, we need to find a rational map between the two spaces. Consider the following map:\n\n$$\\phi: \\mathbb{P}^1 \\rightarrow C, \\quad [s:t] \\mapsto [s^2:t^2:s+t:s-t].$$\n\nThis map is well-defined, as it sends points in $\\mathbb{P}^1$ to points in $C$. Now, we need to find an inverse map:\n\n$$\\psi: C \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1, \\quad [x_0:x_1:x_2:x_3] \\mapsto [x_2+x_3:x_2-x_3].$$\n\nThis map is also well-defined, as it sends points in $C$ to points in $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Moreover, we can check that $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are inverses of each other:\n\n$$\\psi(\\phi([s:t])) = \\psi([s^2:t^2:s+t:s-t]) = [s+t+s-t:s+t-(s-t)] = [2s:2t] = [s:t],$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\phi(\\psi([x_0:x_1:x_2:x_3])) = \\phi([x_2+x_3:x_2-x_3]) = [(x_2+x_3)^2:(x_2-x_3)^2:x_2+x_3+x_2-x_3:x_2+x_3-(x_2-x_3)] = [x_0:x_1:x_2:x_3].$$\n\nThus, $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are inverse maps, and $C$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree and genus of $C$. Since $C$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$, it is a rational curve. Rational curves have degree 1 and genus 0. Therefore, the degree of $C$ is 1, and the genus of $C$ is 0."
