Discriminant Analysis is used to classify new incoming students based on these categories. A sample dataset of 20 students is studied, with the following information (where 1 = Female, 2 = Male, 1 = Freshman, 2 = Sophomore, 3 = Junior and 4 = Senior):\n\n| Student | Major | Gender | Year |\n| ------- | ----- | ------ | ---- |\n| S1      | C     | 1      | 1    |\n| S2      | C     | 1      | 1    |\n| S3      | M     | 1      | 1    |\n| S4      | M     | 2      | 1    |\n| S5      | C     | 2      | 1    |\n| S6      | M     | 2      | 1    |\n| S7      | C     | 1      | 2    |\n| S8      | C     | 2      | 2    |\n| S9      | M     | 2      | 2    |\n| S10     | M     | 1      | 2    |\n| S11     | C     | 1      | 3    |\n| S12     | C     | 1      | 3    |\n| S13     | M     | 1      | 3    |\n| S14     | M     | 2      | 3    |\n| S15     | C     | 2      | 3    |\n| S16     | M     | 2      | 3    |\n| S17     | C     | 1      | 4    |\n| S18     | M     | 2      | 4    |\n| S19     | C     | 2      | 4    |\n| S20     | M     | 1      | 4    |\n\nUsing Discriminant Analysis, classify a new student who is a male in their second year of college and want to declare Computer Science as their major.",
    "message_2": "To perform Discriminant Analysis, we first need to calculate the mean vectors for each group (Computer Science and Mathematics) based on Gender and Year. We will then use these mean vectors to classify the new student.\n\nMean vectors for Computer Science (C) and Mathematics (M) groups:\n\nC: (Gender, Year)\nM: (Gender, Year)\n\nC_mean = ((S1 + S2 + S5 + S7 + S8 + S11 + S12 + S15 + S17 + S19) / 10)\nM_mean = ((S3 + S4 + S6 + S9 + S10 + S13 + S14 + S16 + S18 + S20) / 10)\n\nC_mean = ((1+1+2+1+2+1+1+2+1+2)/10, (1+1+1+2+2+3+3+3+4+4)/10) = (1.4, 2.4)\nM_mean = ((1+2+2+2+1+1+2+2+2+1)/10, (1+1+1+2+2+3+3+3+4+4)/10) = (1.6, 2.6)\n\nNow, we have the mean vectors for both groups. The new student is a male (Gender = 2) in their second year (Year = 2). We will calculate the Euclidean distance between the new student and the mean vectors of both groups.\n\nDistance_C = sqrt((2 - 1.4)^2 + (2 - 2.4)^2) = sqrt(0.6^2 + (-0.4)^2) = sqrt(0.52) ≈ 0.721\nDistance_M = sqrt((2 - 1.6)^2 + (2 - 2.6)^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + (-0.6)^2) = sqrt(0.52) ≈ 0.721\n\nThe Euclidean distances between the new student and both groups are equal. In this case, we can't classify the new student into a specific group using Discriminant Analysis. Additional information or a larger dataset might be needed to make a more accurate classification."
