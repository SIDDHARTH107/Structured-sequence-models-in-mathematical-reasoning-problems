    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 36 = 2^2 * 3^2.\n2. Determine the number of possible divisors for each prime factor.\n   For 2: divisors are 1, 2, and 4.\n   For 3: divisors are 1, 3, and 9.\n3. Use the formula for the number of groups of order p^n * q^m, where p and q are distinct primes, and n and m are their respective powers:\n   G(p^n * q^m) = (p^(n+1) - p) * (q^(m+1) - q) / (p - 1) * (q - 1).\n   In this case, p = 2, n = 2, q = 3, and m = 2.\n   G(2^2 * 3^2) = (2^(2+1) - 2) * (3^(2+1) - 3) / (2 - 1) * (3 - 1) = (8 - 2) * (27 - 3) / (1 * 2) = 6 * 24 / 2 = 72.\n4. Divide the result by the order of the group to find the number of non-isomorphic groups: 72 / 36 = 2.\n\nSo, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
