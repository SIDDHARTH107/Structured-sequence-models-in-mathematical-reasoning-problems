    "message_2": "Let's first find the probability of finding exactly 0 defective chips and exactly 1 defective chip in a sample of 100 chips. Then, we can use the complementary probability to find the probability of finding at least 2 defective chips.\n\nThe probability of a chip being defective is 10/500 = 1/50, and the probability of a chip being non-defective is 49/50.\n\n1. Probability of finding 0 defective chips in a sample of 100 chips:\n\nThis means all 100 chips are non-defective. So, the probability is (49/50)^100.\n\n2. Probability of finding exactly 1 defective chip in a sample of 100 chips:\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n = 100 (number of trials), k = 1 (number of defective chips), p = 1/50 (probability of a chip being defective), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(100, 1) = 100! / (1! * 99!) = 100\n\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (1/50)^1 * (49/50)^99\nP(X = 1) = 100 * (1/50) * (49/50)^99\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 2 defective chips) = 1 - P(0 defective chips) - P(1 defective chip)\nP(at least 2 defective chips) = 1 - (49/50)^100 - [100 * (1/50) * (49/50)^99]\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n(49/50)^100 ≈ 0.134\n100 * (1/50) * (49/50)^99 ≈ 0.271\n\nP(at least 2 defective chips) = 1 - 0.134 - 0.271 ≈ 0.595\n\nSo, the probability of finding at least two defective chips in a sample of 100 chips is approximately 0.595 or 59.5%."
