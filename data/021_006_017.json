    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the finite element method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain\n2. Define the basis functions\n3. Formulate the weak form of the PDE\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\n5. Apply boundary conditions\n6. Solve the linear system\n7. Plot the approximate solution\n\nStep 1: Discretize the domain\nWe will discretize the square domain [0,1] x [0,1] using a triangular mesh with 20 nodes. Since this is a simple square domain, we can create a uniform mesh with 5 nodes along each side, resulting in 16 equally sized triangles.\n\nStep 2: Define the basis functions\nWe will use linear basis functions for the triangular elements. For each triangle, the basis functions are given by:\n\nϕ_i(x, y) = a_i + b_i * x + c_i * y\n\nwhere (a_i, b_i, c_i) are the coefficients for the i-th basis function.\n\nStep 3: Formulate the weak form of the PDE\nTo obtain the weak form of the PDE, we multiply the equation by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫∫(u_xx * v + u_yy * v) dxdy = ∫∫(-sin(x*y) * v) dxdy\n\nStep 4: Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\nWe will now assemble the global stiffness matrix K and the global load vector F. For each element e, we compute the local stiffness matrix K_e and the local load vector F_e, and then assemble them into the global matrix and vector.\n\nK_e(i, j) = ∫∫(ϕ_i_x * ϕ_j_x + ϕ_i_y * ϕ_j_y) dxdy\nF_e(i) = ∫∫(-sin(x*y) * ϕ_i) dxdy\n\nStep 5: Apply boundary conditions\nWe have the following boundary conditions:\n\nu(x,0) = 0, u(x,1) = sin(pi*x), u(0,y) = u(1,y) = 0\n\nWe will apply these boundary conditions by modifying the global stiffness matrix K and the global load vector F accordingly.\n\nStep 6: Solve the linear system\nNow, we can solve the linear system Ku = F for the unknown nodal values u.\n\nStep 7: Plot the approximate solution\nFinally, we can plot the approximate solution as a surface by interpolating the nodal values using the basis functions.\n\nPlease note that the actual implementation of the finite element method requires a numerical software package like MATLAB, Python, or FEniCS. The steps provided here are a general outline of the process."
