    "message_1": "Out of 500 people in a certain city, 65% are women. If the probability of a woman being affected by a disease is 8%, what is the probability that a randomly selected person from the city is a woman and has the disease? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the number of women in the city. We can do this by multiplying the total number of people (500) by the percentage of women (65%).\n\nNumber of women = 500 * 0.65 = 325\n\nNext, we need to find the number of women affected by the disease. We can do this by multiplying the number of women (325) by the probability of a woman being affected by the disease (8%).\n\nNumber of women affected by the disease = 325 * 0.08 = 26\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a randomly selected person being a woman and having the disease. We can do this by dividing the number of women affected by the disease (26) by the total number of people (500).\n\nProbability = 26 / 500 = 0.052\n\nTo express the answer as a percentage rounded to two decimal places, we can multiply the probability by 100.\n\nPercentage = 0.052 * 100 = 5.20%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person from the city is a woman and has the disease is 5.20%."
