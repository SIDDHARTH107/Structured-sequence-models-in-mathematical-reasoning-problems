    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation. Let's denote the Fourier transform of y(x) as Y(ω), then we have:\n\nFourier{y''(x) + 3y'(x) + 2y(x)} = Fourier{e^(-x)}\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as:\n\n(-ω^2 Y(ω) + 3(-iω)Y(ω) + 2Y(ω)) = E(ω)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of e^(-x). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of e^(-x) is:\n\nE(ω) = ∫[e^(-x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from 0 to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = e^(-x) and dv = e^(-iωx) dx\nThen, du = -e^(-x) dx and v = (-1/iω) * e^(-iωx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nE(ω) = (-1/iω) * e^(-x) * e^(-iωx) | from 0 to π + (1/ω^2) * ∫[e^(-x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from 0 to π\n\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\n\nE(ω) = (-1/iω) * (e^(-π) * e^(-iωπ) - 1) + (1/ω^2) * E(ω)\n\nNow, let's solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = E(ω) / (-ω^2 + 3iω + 2)\n\nY(ω) = [(-1/iω) * (e^(-π) * e^(-iωπ) - 1) + (1/ω^2) * E(ω)] / (-ω^2 + 3iω + 2)\n\nTo find the solution y(x), we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω):\n\ny(x) = InverseFourier{Y(ω)}\n\nHowever, finding the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) analytically is quite challenging. Instead, we can use numerical methods to find the inverse Fourier transform and obtain the solution y(x) subject to the given boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y(π) = 0."
