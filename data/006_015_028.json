    "message_2": "To find the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network of 1000 computers, we can use the complementary probability method. \n\nFirst, we find the probability of a computer NOT being attacked by ransomware, which is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nNext, we find the probability of all 1000 computers not being attacked by ransomware, which is (0.98)^1000 ≈ 0.0000454.\n\nFinally, we find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one computer being attacked by ransomware. This is 1 - 0.0000454 ≈ 0.9999546.\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network of 1000 computers is approximately 0.9999546 or 99.99546%."
