    "message_2": "To determine the average speed of the car, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nThe total distance traveled is 120 km, and the total time taken is 2 hours. So, the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = 120 km / 2 hours = 60 km/h\n\nNow, to prove that at some point during the journey, the car must have been traveling at a speed of exactly 60 km/h, we can use the Mean Value Theorem. The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet's consider the position function of the car, s(t), where s(t) represents the distance traveled by the car at time t. Since the car is moving, we can assume that the position function is continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, 2] (the 2-hour journey).\n\nThe average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 2] is:\n\nAverage rate of change = (s(2) - s(0)) / (2 - 0) = 120 km / 2 hours = 60 km/h\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the position function at c is equal to the average rate of change:\n\ns'(c) = 60 km/h\n\nSince s'(t) represents the speed of the car at time t, this means that at some point during the journey (at time c), the car must have been traveling at a speed of exactly 60 km/h."
