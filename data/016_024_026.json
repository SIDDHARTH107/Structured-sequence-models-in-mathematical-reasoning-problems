    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal that is formed by recursively removing squares from the initial square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed. This process is repeated for the remaining 8 squares.\n\nLet's denote the total number of squares in the nth iteration as T(n). In the 0th iteration (initial carpet), there is only 1 square, so T(0) = 1.\n\nFor the 1st iteration, we divide the initial square into 9 smaller squares and remove the central one, leaving 8 squares. So, T(1) = 8.\n\nFor the 2nd iteration, we apply the same process to each of the 8 squares from the 1st iteration. Each of these 8 squares will generate 8 new smaller squares, so T(2) = 8 * 8 = 64.\n\nFor the 3rd iteration, we apply the process to each of the 64 squares from the 2nd iteration. So, T(3) = 64 * 8 = 512.\n\nFinally, for the 4th iteration, we apply the process to each of the 512 squares from the 3rd iteration. So, T(4) = 512 * 8 = 4096.\n\nTherefore, the total number of squares in the 4th iteration of the Sierpinski carpet fractal is 4096."
