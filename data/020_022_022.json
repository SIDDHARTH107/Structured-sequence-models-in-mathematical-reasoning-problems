    "message_1": "A company has four projects that require resources from two departments, Department A and Department B. Each project requires a certain amount of resources from each department as shown in the table below:\n\n| Project | Department A | Department B |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1      | 2           | 1           |\n| 2      | 3           | 2           |\n| 3      | 1           | 3           |\n| 4      | 2           | 2           |\n\nDepartment A has 12 units of resources available and Department B has 10 units of resources available. How many units of resources should the company allocate to each project to maximize the total benefit received from all projects? (Assume that the benefit of each project is proportional to the amount of resources allocated to it.)",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total benefit received from all projects, we can use linear programming. Let x1, x2, x3, and x4 represent the amount of resources allocated to projects 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nTotal Benefit = B1 * x1 + B2 * x2 + B3 * x3 + B4 * x4\n\nwhere B1, B2, B3, and B4 are the benefits per unit of resource for projects 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Since the benefits are proportional to the amount of resources allocated, we can assume B1 = B2 = B3 = B4 = 1 for simplicity.\n\nSo, the objective function becomes:\n\nTotal Benefit = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x1 + 3x2 + x3 + 2x4 <= 12 (Department A resources)\nx1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + 2x4 <= 10 (Department B resources)\nx1, x2, x3, x4 >= 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method or any other optimization technique. The optimal solution is:\n\nx1 = 4\nx2 = 2\nx3 = 0\nx4 = 3\n\nSo, the company should allocate 4 units of resources to Project 1, 2 units to Project 2, 0 units to Project 3, and 3 units to Project 4 to maximize the total benefit. The maximum total benefit is 4 + 2 + 0 + 3 = 9 units."
