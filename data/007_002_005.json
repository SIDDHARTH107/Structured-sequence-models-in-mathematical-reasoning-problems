    "message_2": "To find the smallest four-digit number divisible by both 6 and 8, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8, and then find the smallest multiple of that LCM that is a four-digit number.\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 6 and 8. Prime factorize the numbers:\n\n6 = 2 × 3\n8 = 2^3\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor and multiply them together:\n\nLCM(6, 8) = 2^3 × 3 = 24\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest four-digit multiple of 24. Divide 1000 by 24:\n\n1000 ÷ 24 = 41.666...\n\nSince we need the smallest four-digit multiple, round up to the nearest whole number:\n\n42\n\nNow, multiply 42 by 24:\n\n42 × 24 = 1008\n\nSo, the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by both 6 and 8 is 1008."
