    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it counts the number of integers that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 with n.\n\nTo compute the value of φ(n) for a given n, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 35, we first find its prime factors:\n\n35 = 5 * 7\n\nNow, we can plug these prime factors into the formula:\n\nφ(35) = 35 * (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 1/7)\nφ(35) = 35 * (4/5) * (6/7)\nφ(35) = (35 * 4 * 6) / (5 * 7)\nφ(35) = (2 * 3 * 7) = 42\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for 35 is 42."
