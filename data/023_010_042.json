    "message_2": "To calculate the value of the highest frequency component in the Fourier transform of the image, we first need to understand the properties of the 2D Fourier transform.\n\nThe 2D Fourier transform of an image is given by:\n\nF(u, v) = ∑∑ f(x, y) * e^(-j2π(ux/M + vy/N))\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the Fourier transform, f(x, y) is the image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (512x512 in this case), and u, v, x, and y are the indices in the frequency and spatial domains, respectively.\n\nThe magnitude spectrum is given by:\n\n|F(u, v)| = sqrt(Re(F(u, v))^2 + Im(F(u, v))^2)\n\nwhere Re(F(u, v)) and Im(F(u, v)) are the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform, respectively.\n\nThe center frequency corresponds to the DC component (u = M/2, v = N/2), which is the average intensity of the image. In this case, the magnitude at the center frequency is given as 250.\n\nThe highest frequency components are located at the corners of the Fourier transform (u = 0, v = 0), (u = 0, v = N-1), (u = M-1, v = 0), and (u = M-1, v = N-1). However, we cannot directly calculate the value of the highest frequency component from the given information.\n\nThe magnitude at the center frequency does not provide enough information to determine the value of the highest frequency component. We would need more information about the image or its Fourier transform to calculate the highest frequency component's value."
