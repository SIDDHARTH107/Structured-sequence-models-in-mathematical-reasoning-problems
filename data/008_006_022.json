    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[1-λ, -2, 0], [3, 4-λ, 6], [-1, 0, 3-λ]]\n\nNow, we find the determinant of this matrix:\n\n|A - λI| = (1-λ)[(4-λ)(3-λ)] - (-2)[3(-1)] + 0 - 0 - 6(-1) - 0\n|A - λI| = (1-λ)[(12 - 7λ + λ^2)] + 6\n|A - λI| = -λ^3 + 8λ^2 - 15λ + 6\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation. The roots are λ1 = 1, λ2 = 2, and λ3 = 3.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([[0, -2, 0], [3, 3, 6], [-1, 0, 2]])([x1, x2, x3]) = [0, 0, 0]\n\nWe can simplify this system of equations to:\n-2x2 = 0\n3x1 + 3x2 + 6x3 = 0\n-x1 + 2x3 = 0\n\nSolving this system, we get x1 = 2x3 and x2 = 0. Let x3 = 1, then the eigenvector v1 = [2, 0, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 2:\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([[-1, -2, 0], [3, 2, 6], [-1, 0, 1]])([x1, x2, x3]) = [0, 0, 0]\n\nWe can simplify this system of equations to:\n-x1 - 2x2 = 0\n3x1 + 2x2 + 6x3 = 0\n-x1 + x3 = 0\n\nSolving this system, we get x1 = x3 and x2 = -0.5x1. Let x1 = 1, then the eigenvector v2 = [1, -0.5, 1].\n\nFor λ3 = 3:\n(A - λ3I)v3 = 0\n([[-2, -2, 0], [3, 1, 6], [-1, 0, 0]])([x1, x2, x3]) = [0, 0, 0]\n\nWe can simplify this system of equations to:\n-2x1 - 2x2 = 0\n3x1 + x2 + 6x3 = 0\n-x1 = 0\n\nSolving this system, we get x1 = 0 and x2 = 0. Let x3 = 1, then the eigenvector v3 = [0, 0, 1].\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1, λ2 = 2, and λ3 = 3, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [2, 0, 1], v2 = [1, -0.5, 1], and v3 = [0, 0, 1]."
