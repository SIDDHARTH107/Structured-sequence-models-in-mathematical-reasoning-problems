    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 3x + 5 between the limits x = 0 and x = 5, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nFirst, let's find the integral of the function:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 3x + 5) dx = (1/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 + 5x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the given limits:\n\n[(1/3)(5)^3 + (3/2)(5)^2 + 5(5)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + (3/2)(0)^2 + 5(0)]\n\n= [(1/3)(125) + (3/2)(25) + 25] - [0]\n\n= [41.67 + 37.5 + 25]\n\n= 104.17\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 + 3x + 5 between the limits x = 0 and x = 5 is approximately 104.17 square units."
