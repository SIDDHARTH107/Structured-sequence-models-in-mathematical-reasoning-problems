    "message_2": "In a right triangle with an angle of 30 degrees, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios are as follows:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of 30 degrees: sin(30) = 1/2\n2. Cosine (cos) of 30 degrees: cos(30) = √3/2\n3. Tangent (tan) of 30 degrees: tan(30) = 1/√3 or √3/3\n\nThese values are derived from the special 30-60-90 right triangle, where the side ratios are 1:√3:2."
