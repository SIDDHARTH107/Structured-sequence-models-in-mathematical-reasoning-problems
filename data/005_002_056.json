    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces bags of chips and claims that the mean weight of each bag is 500 grams. A sample of 50 bags was taken and the mean weight was found to be 498 grams with a standard deviation of 5.5 grams. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the bags.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the bags, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 498 grams, the standard deviation is 5.5 grams, and the sample size is 50 bags. First, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 5.5 / √50 ≈ 0.777\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 498 ± (1.96 * 0.777)\n\nConfidence Interval = 498 ± 1.52\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the bags is approximately (496.48, 499.52) grams."
