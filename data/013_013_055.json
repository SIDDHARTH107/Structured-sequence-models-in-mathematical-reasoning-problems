    "message_1": "In an auction, a seller is selling a painting to a group of five potential buyers. Each buyer submits a sealed bid (a non-negative integer) for the painting without knowing the bids of the other buyers. The seller will sell the painting to the highest bidder. If there is a tie for the highest bid, the seller will randomly choose one of the tied bidders to sell the painting to. \n\nThe five bids submitted are: 250, 300, 200, 400, and 250. What is the expected revenue for the seller?",
    "message_2": "In this case, there is no need to calculate expected revenue since we already have the bids submitted by the potential buyers. The highest bid is 400, so the seller will sell the painting for 400. The expected revenue for the seller is 400."
