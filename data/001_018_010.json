    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that $\\log_b(a) - \\log_b(c) = \\log_b(\\frac{a}{c})$. Applying this rule to the given expression, we get:\n\n$\\log_2(8) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(\\frac{8}{2})$\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction inside the logarithm:\n\n$\\log_2(\\frac{8}{2}) = \\log_2(4)$\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the logarithm:\n\n$\\log_2(4) = 2$\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is 2."
