    "message_2": "To find the average acceleration of the car when it is braking, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere v is the final velocity (0 mph, since the car comes to a stop), u is the initial velocity (60 mph), a is the average acceleration, and s is the distance traveled during braking (100 feet).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial velocity from miles per hour to feet per second:\n\n1 mile = 5280 feet\n1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\n60 miles per hour = 60 * (5280 / 3600) feet per second ≈ 88 feet per second\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the kinematic equation:\n\n0^2 = (88)^2 + 2a(100)\n\n0 = 7744 + 200a\n\n-7744 = 200a\n\na = -7744 / 200\n\na ≈ -38.72 feet per second^2\n\nSo, the average acceleration of the car when it is braking is approximately -38.72 feet per second^2 (negative sign indicates deceleration)."
