    "message_1": "A trapezium has bases of length 8cm and 14cm and the height is 5cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the shorter base a (8cm), the length of the longer base b (14cm), and the height h (5cm). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's call the length of the left side c and the length of the right side d. We can form two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from the top left vertex of the trapezium to the base, and another from the top right vertex to the base.\n\nFor the left triangle, we have:\na + x = b\nx = b - a\nx = 14 - 8\nx = 6cm\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for both triangles:\n\nLeft triangle:\nc^2 = h^2 + x^2\nc^2 = 5^2 + 6^2\nc^2 = 25 + 36\nc^2 = 61\nc = √61\n\nRight triangle:\nd^2 = h^2 + (a - x)^2\nd^2 = 5^2 + (8 - 6)^2\nd^2 = 25 + 2^2\nd^2 = 25 + 4\nd^2 = 29\nd = √29\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding all the side lengths:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c + d\nPerimeter = 8 + 14 + √61 + √29\nPerimeter ≈ 22 + 7.81 + 5.39\nPerimeter ≈ 35.20 cm"
