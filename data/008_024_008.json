    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations:\n\n1) 2x - y + z = 1\n2) x + y - z = 3\n\nAdd equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(2x - y + z) + (x + y - z) = 1 + 3\n3x = 4\nx = 4/3\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations:\n\n1) 2x - y + z = 1\n3) 3x + 2y - 2z = 2\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 3 by 2:\n\n1) 6x - 3y + 3z = 3\n3) 6x + 4y - 4z = 4\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(6x + 4y - 4z) - (6x - 3y + 3z) = 4 - 3\n7y - 7z = 1\n\nNow, let's eliminate y from the second and third equations:\n\n2) x + y - z = 3\n3) 3x + 2y - 2z = 2\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2 and equation 3 by -1:\n\n2) 2x + 2y - 2z = 6\n3) -3x - 2y + 2z = -2\n\nAdd equation 2 and equation 3:\n\n(2x + 2y - 2z) + (-3x - 2y + 2z) = 6 - 2\n-x = 4\nx = -4\n\nWe have found two different values for x (4/3 and -4) in the process, which indicates that there is an inconsistency in the given system of linear equations. This means that the system has no solution, and there are no values for x, y, and z that satisfy all three equations simultaneously."
