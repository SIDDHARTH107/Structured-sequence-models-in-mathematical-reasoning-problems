    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to one of the given groups, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible Sylow subgroups of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 18, we have |G| = 2 * 3^2. Therefore, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow p-subgroups:\n\n1. For p = 2, we have n_2 | 9 and n_2 = 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9.\n2. For p = 3, we have n_3 | 2 and n_3 = 1 (mod 3). The only possible value for n_3 is 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P_2 be this normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2. Since n_3 = 1, there is also a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3, of order 9. The intersection of P_2 and P_3 is trivial, as their orders are coprime. Therefore, by the second isomorphism theorem, we have:\n\nG = P_2 * P_3 ≅ C_2 * C_9\n\nSince C_2 and C_9 are both cyclic, their direct product is also cyclic. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18 in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9\nIn this case, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G. However, there is still a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, P_3, of order 9. Let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2. Since P_3 is normal in G, we can form the semi-direct product of H and P_3. The semi-direct product depends on the action of H on P_3, which is determined by a homomorphism φ: H → Aut(P_3).\n\nNow, Aut(P_3) is isomorphic to the group of units of the integers modulo 9, which is (Z/9Z)^× ≅ C_6. Since |H| = 2, the only non-trivial homomorphism φ maps H to an element of order 2 in Aut(P_3). This gives us a non-abelian semi-direct product of H and P_3, which is a group of order 18.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18 or the non-abelian group of order 18, depending on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. However, G cannot be isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6, as this would imply the existence of a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, which is not the case when n_2 = 9."
