    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions of the equation x^2 + 1 = 5y^2, we can proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, rearrange the equation to get x^2 - 5y^2 = -1.\n\nThis is a Pell-type equation, which can be solved using continued fractions. However, we can also find the solutions by inspection and then use the properties of Pell-type equations to generate all solutions.\n\nWe are looking for integer solutions (x, y) such that x^2 - 5y^2 = -1. We can start by trying out some values of y and see if we get a perfect square for x^2.\n\nFor y = 1, x^2 = 4, which gives x = ±2.\nFor y = 2, x^2 = 16, which gives x = ±4.\nFor y = 3, x^2 = 36, which gives x = ±6.\n\nWe can notice that for y = 1, x^2 - 5y^2 = 4 - 5 = -1, which is a solution. However, for y = 2 and y = 3, the equation x^2 - 5y^2 is not equal to -1.\n\nNow, we can use the property of Pell-type equations that states that if (x1, y1) is a solution, then all other solutions can be generated using the formula:\n\nx_n + y_n * sqrt(5) = (x1 + y1 * sqrt(5))^n\n\nFor n = 1, we have the initial solution (x1, y1) = (2, 1).\n\nFor n = 2, we get:\n\n(x2 + y2 * sqrt(5)) = (2 + sqrt(5))^2 = 9 + 4 * sqrt(5)\n\nThis gives us x2 = 9 and y2 = 4.\n\nFor n = 3, we get:\n\n(x3 + y3 * sqrt(5)) = (2 + sqrt(5))^3 = 38 + 17 * sqrt(5)\n\nThis gives us x3 = 38 and y3 = 17.\n\nWe can continue this process to generate all integer solutions of the equation x^2 + 1 = 5y^2. The solutions will be of the form:\n\n(x_n, y_n) = ((2 + sqrt(5))^n + (2 - sqrt(5))^n)/2, ((2 + sqrt(5))^n - (2 - sqrt(5))^n)/(2 * sqrt(5))\n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSo, the integer solutions are:\n\n(2, 1), (9, 4), (38, 17), ..."
