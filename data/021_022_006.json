    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, product A and product B. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, whereas each unit of product B requires 1 hour of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The company has a total of 160 hours of labor and 240 hours of machine time available. If the profit per unit of product A is $20 and the profit per unit of product B is $30, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit using firefly algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that cannot be directly applied to solve this linear programming problem. However, we can solve this problem using graphical method or simplex method.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are:\n\n2x + y ≤ 160 (labor constraint)\n3x + 4y ≤ 240 (machine time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 160\ny ≤ -2x + 160\n\n2. 3x + 4y ≤ 240\ny ≤ -3/4x + 60\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities, which forms a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,60), (40,80), and (80,0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0,60) = 20(0) + 30(60) = $1800\n3. P(40,80) = 20(40) + 30(80) = $3200\n4. P(80,0) = 20(80) + 30(0) = $1600\n\nThe maximum profit is $3200, which occurs when the company produces 40 units of product A and 80 units of product B."
