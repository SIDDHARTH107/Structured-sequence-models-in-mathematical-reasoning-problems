    "message_2": "Differential evolution is a numerical optimization algorithm that can be used to find the global minimum of a function. In this case, we will use it to find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x over the range -5 ≤ x ≤ 5.\n\nTo implement differential evolution, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 50 random solutions (x-values) within the given range.\n2. For each iteration, create a new population by applying the mutation, crossover, and selection operations.\n3. Repeat step 2 for 1000 iterations or until convergence is reached.\n4. The best solution found during the process will be the global minimum.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the differential evolution algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 3*x**2 - 9*x\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, max_iter, bounds):\n    # Initialize population\n    population = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], pop_size)\n    \n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        new_population = []\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            # Mutation\n            a, b, c = population[np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)]\n            mutant = a + 0.8 * (b - c)\n            \n            # Crossover\n            trial = population[i] if np.random.rand() < 0.9 else mutant\n            \n            # Selection\n            new_population.append(trial if f(trial) < f(population[i]) else population[i])\n        \n        population = np.array(new_population)\n    \n    best_solution = population[np.argmin([f(x) for x in population])]\n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\npop_size = 50\nmax_iter = 1000\nbounds = (-5, 5)\n\nbest_solution, best_value = differential_evolution(pop_size, max_iter, bounds)\nprint(\"Global minimum value: {:.4f} at x = {:.4f}\".format(best_value, best_solution))\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the global minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x over the range -5 ≤ x ≤ 5 using differential evolution with a population size of 50 and a maximum of 1000 iterations. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm."
