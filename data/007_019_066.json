    "message_2": "The product of the first 20 positive integers is 20! (20 factorial), which is equal to 20 × 19 × 18 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1. To find the smallest prime number that evenly divides this product, we need to find the smallest prime factor of any of the numbers in the sequence.\n\nThe smallest prime number is 2, and since there are even numbers in the sequence (e.g., 2, 4, 6, ..., 20), the smallest prime number that evenly divides the product of the first 20 positive integers is 2."
