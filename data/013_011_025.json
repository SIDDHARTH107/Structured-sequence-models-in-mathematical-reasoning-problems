    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms, A and B, that sell identical products in a market. The cost of producing one unit of the product is $10 for both firms. Firm A decides to set a price of $20 per unit, while firm B sets a price of $25 per unit. Given these prices, how many units will each firm sell and what will be their profits? Assume that customers will always choose the firm with the lower price if the prices are different.",
    "message_2": "Since customers will always choose the firm with the lower price if the prices are different, Firm A will sell all the units while Firm B will sell none. However, without knowing the total demand for the product in the market, we cannot determine the exact number of units Firm A will sell. \n\nLet's assume Firm A sells 'x' units of the product. The profit for Firm A will be:\n\nProfit_A = (Price_A - Cost) * Units_sold_A\nProfit_A = ($20 - $10) * x\nProfit_A = $10 * x\n\nSince Firm B doesn't sell any units, its profit will be $0.\n\nIn conclusion, Firm A will sell all the units in the market and make a profit of $10 per unit, while Firm B will not sell any units and make no profit. The exact number of units sold by Firm A depends on the total demand for the product in the market."
