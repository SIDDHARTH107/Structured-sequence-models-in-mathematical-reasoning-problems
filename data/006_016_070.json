    "message_1": "A manufacturing process produces 5000 products with a probability of a certain type of defect occurring in 0.05%. What is the probability that out of 5000 products, exactly 3 will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (defective products) in n trials (total products)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (defect) on a single trial\n- n is the total number of trials (products)\n- k is the number of successes (defective products)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 5000 (total number of products)\n- k = 3 (we want to find the probability of exactly 3 defective products)\n- p = 0.05% = 0.0005 (probability of a defect occurring in a single product)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5000, 3) * (0.0005)^3 * (1-0.0005)^(5000-3)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(5000, 3):\n\nC(5000, 3) = 5000! / (3!(5000-3)!)\nC(5000, 3) = 5000! / (3! * 4997!)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nC(5000, 3) ≈ 20,833,667,500\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 20,833,667,500 * (0.0005)^3 * (0.9995)^(4997)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.141467\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 out of 5000 products will have the defect is approximately 14.15%."
