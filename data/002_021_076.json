    "message_2": "To calculate the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle in degrees / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven, the radius of the circle (r) is 8 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 8²\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 64\nArea of sector = 64π/6\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nArea of sector = 32π/3\n\nSo, the area of the sector is (32π/3) cm²."
