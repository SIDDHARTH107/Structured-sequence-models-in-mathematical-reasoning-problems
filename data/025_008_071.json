    "message_2": "First, let's solve the system of linear equations for x and y:\n\n4x + 5y = 12\n3x - 2y = -1\n\nWe can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5 to make the coefficients of y the same:\n\n8x + 10y = 24\n15x - 10y = -5\n\nNow, add the two equations to eliminate y:\n\n(8x + 10y) + (15x - 10y) = 24 + (-5)\n8x + 15x = 19\n23x = 19\n\nNow, divide by 23 to solve for x:\n\nx = 19/23\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n4(19/23) + 5y = 12\n76/23 + 5y = 12\n\nSubtract 76/23 from both sides:\n\n5y = 12 - 76/23\n5y = (276 - 76)/23\n5y = 200/23\n\nNow, divide by 5 to solve for y:\n\ny = (200/23) / 5\ny = 40/23\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 19/23 and y = 40/23.\n\nNow, let's use Hodge theory to determine the dimension of the vector space of harmonic forms on the complex projective plane CP^2. The Hodge diamond for CP^2 is given by:\n\n```\n  1\n 0 0\n1 0 1\n```\n\nThe numbers in the Hodge diamond represent the dimensions of the vector spaces of harmonic forms. The total dimension of the vector space of harmonic forms on CP^2 is the sum of all the numbers in the Hodge diamond:\n\n1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the dimension of the vector space of harmonic forms on the complex projective plane CP^2 is 3."
