    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain company's stock price increasing tomorrow by $10\\%$ is $0.6$ and the probability of a decrease of $5\\%$ is $0.4$. If the current stock price is $100$, what is the expected stock price change tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected stock price change, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding change in stock price and then sum the results.\n\nIf the stock price increases by 10%, the change in stock price is $100 * 0.1 = 10$.\nIf the stock price decreases by 5%, the change in stock price is $100 * (-0.05) = -5$.\n\nNow, we multiply each change in stock price by its probability and sum the results:\n\nExpected stock price change = (10 * 0.6) + (-5 * 0.4) = 6 - 2 = 4\n\nSo, the expected stock price change tomorrow is $4."
