    "message_1": "A string with a length of 50 cm is tied between two fixed points. The wave propagates with a speed of 100 cm/s and has a frequency of 50 Hz. Write the wave equation for the given wave and find the wavelength, amplitude, and period.",
    "message_2": "To write the wave equation, we first need to find the angular frequency (ω) and the wave number (k). The angular frequency can be found using the formula:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nwhere f is the frequency. Given that the frequency is 50 Hz, we can calculate the angular frequency:\n\nω = 2π(50) = 100π rad/s\n\nNext, we need to find the wave speed (v) and the wavelength (λ). The wave speed is given as 100 cm/s. We can use the formula:\n\nv = fλ\n\nto find the wavelength:\n\n100 cm/s = 50 Hz * λ\n\nλ = 100 cm/s / 50 Hz = 2 cm\n\nNow we have the wavelength and the wave speed, we can find the wave number (k) using the formula:\n\nk = 2π/λ\n\nk = 2π / 2 cm = π cm^(-1)\n\nThe general form of the wave equation is:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, x is the position, t is the time, and φ is the phase constant. Since we don't have information about the amplitude and phase constant, we can write the wave equation as:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(πx - 100πt + φ)\n\nNow, let's summarize our findings:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 2 cm\nAmplitude (A) = Not given\nPeriod (T) = 1/frequency = 1/50 Hz = 0.02 s"
