    "message_2": "To compute the approximate value of f'(2) using the forward difference formula, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at x = 2 and x = 2 + h, where h = 0.1.\n\nFirst, let's find f(2):\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 5(2)^2 + 3(2) - 1\nf(2) = 2(8) - 5(4) + 6 - 1\nf(2) = 16 - 20 + 6 - 1\nf(2) = 1\n\nNow, let's find f(2 + h) = f(2.1):\nf(2.1) = 2(2.1)^3 - 5(2.1)^2 + 3(2.1) - 1\nf(2.1) = 2(9.261) - 5(4.41) + 6.3 - 1\nf(2.1) = 18.522 - 22.05 + 6.3 - 1\nf(2.1) = 1.772\n\nNow, we can use the forward difference formula to approximate f'(2):\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + h) - f(2)) / h\nf'(2) ≈ (1.772 - 1) / 0.1\nf'(2) ≈ 7.72\n\nSo, the approximate value of f'(2) using the forward difference formula with a step size of h = 0.1 is 7.72."
