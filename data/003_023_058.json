    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + (-2)² + 0²) = √(9 + 4) = √13\n|B| = √(0² + 5² + (-1)²) = √(25 + 1) = √26\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between A and B using the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A||B|cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A||B|)\n\nThe dot product of A and B is:\n\nA · B = (3 * 0) + (-2 * 5) + (0 * -1) = -10\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (-10) / (√13 * √26) ≈ -0.6547\n\nNow, we can find the sine of the angle θ:\n\nsin(θ) = √(1 - cos²(θ)) ≈ √(1 - (-0.6547)²) ≈ 0.7559\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nTo find the unit vector n, we can use the right-hand rule. Since A = [3, -2, 0] and B = [0, 5, -1], the unit vector n will point in the positive z-direction (out of the plane formed by A and B). Therefore, n = [0, 0, 1].\n\nA x B = (√13)(√26)(0.7559)[0, 0, 1] ≈ [0, 0, 15.4919]\n\nSo, the cross product of A and B is approximately [0, 0, 15.49]."
