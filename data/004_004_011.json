    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve represented by y = 2x + 1 between x = 1 and x = 5, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = 2x + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\nâˆ«(2x + 1) dx = x^2 + x + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the given limits, x = 1 and x = 5:\n\nArea = (x^2 + x)|[1, 5]\n\nFirst, let's find the value of the integral at the upper limit, x = 5:\n\n(5^2 + 5) = 25 + 5 = 30\n\nNow, let's find the value of the integral at the lower limit, x = 1:\n\n(1^2 + 1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nFinally, subtract the value of the integral at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit:\n\nArea = 30 - 2 = 28\n\nSo, the area under the curve represented by y = 2x + 1 between x = 1 and x = 5 is 28 square units."
