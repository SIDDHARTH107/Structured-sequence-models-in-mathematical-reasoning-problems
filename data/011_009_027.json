    "message_2": "We will use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We have 8 guests (stars) and we need to distribute them into 10 rooms (bars). We can think of this as placing 9 dividers (bars) between the guests (stars) to separate them into different rooms.\n\nFor example, if we have the following arrangement:\n\nGuests: * * * * * * * *\nDividers: | | | | | | | | | \n\nWe can place the dividers between the guests to separate them into different rooms:\n\n* * | * | * * | | * | * | | | | \n\nIn this example, we have placed the guests into 5 rooms, with 2 guests in the first room, 1 guest in the second room, 2 guests in the third room, 1 guest in the fifth room, and 1 guest in the sixth room.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to place the 9 dividers between the 8 guests. Since each room can accommodate up to 3 guests, we can place at most 2 dividers between any pair of guests. So, we can think of this as placing 9 dividers into 7 available spaces between the guests (with at most 2 dividers in each space).\n\nWe can use the formula for combinations with repetitions to find the number of ways to place the dividers:\n\nC(n + r - 1, r) = C(n - 1, r - 1)\nwhere n is the number of spaces (7) and r is the number of dividers (9).\n\nC(7 + 9 - 1, 9) = C(15, 9) = 15! / (9! * (15 - 9)!)\n\nCalculating the factorial values:\n\n15! = 1,307,674,368,000\n9! = 362,880\n6! = 720\n\nNow, we can find the number of combinations:\n\nC(15, 9) = 1,307,674,368,000 / (362,880 * 720) = 5005\n\nSo, there are 5005 ways to accommodate groups of 8 guests in the hotel with 10 rooms, where each room can accommodate up to 3 guests."
