    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 49. Since 49 = 7^2, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 7-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 7-subgroup of G. Since the index of P in G is 7, which is the smallest prime dividing the order of G, P is a normal subgroup of G (by the Sylow Theorems).\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since |G/P| = |G|/|P| = 49/7 = 7, G/P is a cyclic group of order 7. Let gP be a generator of G/P, where g is an element of G. Then, for any element x in G, we can write x = g^n * p for some n in {0, 1, ..., 6} and p in P. This is because the cosets of P partition G, and g generates all the cosets.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 49.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then there is no single element that generates the entire group. In this case, we claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7.\n\nLet P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨g⟩, where a and g are elements of order 7 in G. Since G is not cyclic, we know that ⟨a⟩ ∩ ⟨g⟩ = {e}, where e is the identity element. Now, consider the map φ: G → ⟨a⟩ × ⟨g⟩ defined by φ(x) = (x * g^(-n), g^n), where x = g^n * p for some p in P (as described earlier). We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is a homomorphism:\nLet x = g^n * p and y = g^m * q, where p, q are in P. Then,\nφ(xy) = φ(g^n * p * g^m * q) = (g^(n+m) * p * q * g^(-n-m), g^(n+m))\n= (g^m * p * q * g^(-m), g^n * g^m) = (g^m * p * g^(-m), g^n) * (p * q * g^(-n), g^m)\n= φ(x)φ(y).\n\n2. φ is injective:\nSuppose φ(x) = φ(y). Then, (x * g^(-n), g^n) = (y * g^(-m), g^m) for some n, m. This implies x * g^(-n) = y * g^(-m) and g^n = g^m. Hence, x * g^(-m) = y * g^(-n), which implies x = y * g^(-n) * g^m = y * g^(m-n). Since g generates a cyclic group of order 7, g^(m-n) is in P. Thus, x and y differ by an element in P, which means x and y belong to the same coset of P. But since x and y have the same power of g, they must be the same element. Therefore, x = y, and φ is injective.\n\n3. φ is surjective:\nFor any (p, g^n) in ⟨a⟩ × ⟨g⟩, we can find x = g^n * p in G such that φ(x) = (p, g^n). Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7: G ≅ ⟨a⟩ × ⟨g⟩.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 49 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7."
