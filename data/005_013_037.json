They produce the following table of data:\n\n|Advertising Expenditure | Sales|\n|-----------|------|\n|5000        | 10000|\n|7500        | 12000|\n|10000      | 15000|\n|8500        | 13500|\n|6000        | 11000|\n\nUsing multivariate analysis, find the equation of the line of best fit to predict sales based on advertising expenditure, and use the equation to predict the sales when the advertising expenditure is $9000.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line of best fit, we will use the least squares method. First, we need to find the mean of advertising expenditure (x) and sales (y).\n\nMean of advertising expenditure (x̄) = (5000 + 7500 + 10000 + 8500 + 6000) / 5 = 39500 / 5 = 7900\nMean of sales (ȳ) = (10000 + 12000 + 15000 + 13500 + 11000) / 5 = 61500 / 5 = 12300\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (b) of the line of best fit using the formula:\n\nb = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nCalculating the values for each data point:\n\n(5000 - 7900)(10000 - 12300) = -2900 * -2300 = 6670000\n(7500 - 7900)(12000 - 12300) = -400 * -300 = 120000\n(10000 - 7900)(15000 - 12300) = 2100 * 2700 = 5670000\n(8500 - 7900)(13500 - 12300) = 600 * 1200 = 720000\n(6000 - 7900)(11000 - 12300) = -1900 * -1300 = 2470000\n\nSum of the numerators: 6670000 + 120000 + 5670000 + 720000 + 2470000 = 15672000\n\n(5000 - 7900)^2 = 8410000\n(7500 - 7900)^2 = 160000\n(10000 - 7900)^2 = 4410000\n(8500 - 7900)^2 = 360000\n(6000 - 7900)^2 = 3610000\n\nSum of the denominators: 8410000 + 160000 + 4410000 + 360000 + 3610000 = 17000000\n\nNow we can find the slope (b):\n\nb = 15672000 / 17000000 = 0.9218823529411765\n\nNext, we need to find the y-intercept (a) using the formula:\n\na = ȳ - b * x̄\n\na = 12300 - 0.9218823529411765 * 7900 = 12300 - 7282.941176470588 = 5017.058823529412\n\nNow we have the equation of the line of best fit:\n\ny = 0.9218823529411765x + 5017.058823529412\n\nTo predict the sales when the advertising expenditure is $9000, plug in x = 9000:\n\ny = 0.9218823529411765 * 9000 + 5017.058823529412 = 8296.941176470588 + 5017.058823529412 = 13314\n\nSo, the predicted sales when the advertising expenditure is $9000 is approximately $13,314."
