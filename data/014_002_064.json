    "message_2": "In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Alice's public key, A, is calculated using the formula:\n\nA = g^a mod p\n\nwhere g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret key, and p is the prime number.\n\nIn this case, g = 2, a = 4, and p = 11.\n\nA = 2^4 mod 11\nA = 16 mod 11\nA = 5\n\nSo, the value of Alice's public key, A, is 5."
