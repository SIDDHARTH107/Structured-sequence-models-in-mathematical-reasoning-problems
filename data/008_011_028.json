    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix, which we'll call D.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2  1 |\n| 1 -3 |\n\nD = (2 * -3) - (1 * 1) = -6 - 1 = -7\n\nNow, we need to find the determinants of the matrices formed by replacing the columns of the coefficient matrix with the constants from the right-hand side of the equations. We'll call these determinants Dx and Dy.\n\nFor Dx, replace the first column of the coefficient matrix with the constants (7 and -2):\n| 7  1 |\n| -2 -3 |\n\nDx = (7 * -3) - (1 * -2) = -21 + 2 = -19\n\nFor Dy, replace the second column of the coefficient matrix with the constants (7 and -2):\n| 2  7 |\n| 1 -2 |\n\nDy = (2 * -2) - (1 * 7) = -4 - 7 = -11\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = Dx / D = -19 / -7 = 19/7\n\ny = Dy / D = -11 / -7 = 11/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 19/7 and y = 11/7."
