    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n Ã— n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, the symbols are the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. To complete the Latin square, we need to fill in the remaining cells while maintaining the Latin square property.\n\nLet's fill in the remaining cells:\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2 | 4 | 1 | 3 |\n| 3 | 1 | 4 | 2 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n\nNow, the Latin square is complete, and each number appears exactly once in each row and column."
