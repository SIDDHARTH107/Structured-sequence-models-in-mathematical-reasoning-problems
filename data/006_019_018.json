    "message_1": "What is the probability that in a country with a population of 50 million, exactly 25% of the population will vote for a certain political party in the upcoming national elections, given that the margin of error is plus or minus 2%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the percentage of the population voting for the political party falls within the range of 23% to 27% (25% Â± 2%).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that we cannot provide an exact probability without more information about the distribution of voters' preferences, such as whether the preferences are normally distributed or follow some other distribution.\n\nIf we assume a normal distribution and have information about the standard deviation, we could use the z-score formula and a standard normal table to find the probability. But without that information, we cannot provide an exact probability for this scenario."
