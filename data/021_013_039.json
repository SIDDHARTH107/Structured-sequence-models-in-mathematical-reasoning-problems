    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem that a math student can solve related to \"Solving optimization problems using simulated annealing method\":\n\nSuppose a manufacturer produces two products A and B that require two types of raw materials X and Y. The company wants to maximize its profit. The unit profit from product A is $20, from product B is $10, the total amount of raw material X is 100 units, the total amount of raw material Y is 80 units. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of raw material X and 1 unit of raw material Y, and each unit of product B requires 1 unit of raw material X and 2 units of raw material Y. Using simulated annealing method, determine how many units of each product should the manufacturer produce to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and initial solution.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 20A + 10B\nConstraints: 2A + B <= 100 (raw material X constraint)\n             A + 2B <= 80 (raw material Y constraint)\n             A, B >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nLet's start with an initial solution, for example, A = 0 and B = 0.\n\nNow, we will perform the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Set an initial temperature T and a cooling rate alpha (e.g., T = 1000 and alpha = 0.99).\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution by slightly changing the values of A and B.\n3. Calculate the change in profit (delta_P) between the current solution and the neighboring solution.\n4. If delta_P > 0, accept the neighboring solution as the new current solution.\n5. If delta_P <= 0, accept the neighboring solution with a probability of exp(delta_P / T).\n6. Update the temperature T = alpha * T.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the temperature is below a certain threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter performing the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain an approximate solution for the number of units of products A and B that the manufacturer should produce to maximize the profit. Note that the simulated annealing method provides an approximate solution, and the result may vary depending on the initial solution, temperature, cooling rate, and other parameters."
