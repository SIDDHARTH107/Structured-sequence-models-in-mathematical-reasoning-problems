    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nTo find the total number of squares in a level-5 Menger sponge, we need to consider the number of squares added at each level of the construction.\n\nAt level 0, there is just one cube, which has 6 faces (squares).\n\nAt level 1, 20 smaller cubes are left after the removal process, and each of these cubes has 6 faces. So, there are 20 * 6 = 120 squares at level 1.\n\nFor each subsequent level, the number of squares increases by a factor of 20, since each remaining cube from the previous level is replaced by 20 smaller cubes.\n\nSo, the total number of squares in a level-5 Menger sponge is:\n\nLevel 0: 6\nLevel 1: 120\nLevel 2: 120 * 20 = 2400\nLevel 3: 2400 * 20 = 48000\nLevel 4: 48000 * 20 = 960000\nLevel 5: 960000 * 20 = 19200000\n\nThus, there are 19,200,000 squares in a level-5 Menger sponge."
