    "message_2": "To determine the order and type of the zero at z = 2i for the complex function f(z) = (z^3 + 3z^2 - 2)/(z - 2i), we first need to find if 2i is a zero of the numerator.\n\nLet's substitute z = 2i into the numerator:\n\n(2i)^3 + 3(2i)^2 - 2\n= -8i + 3(4) - 2\n= -8i + 12 - 2\n= -8i + 10\n\nSince the result is not zero, 2i is not a zero of the numerator.\n\nNow let's check if 2i is a zero of the denominator:\n\nz - 2i = 2i - 2i = 0\n\nSince the result is zero, 2i is a zero of the denominator.\n\nSince 2i is a zero of the denominator but not the numerator, it is a pole of the function f(z). To determine the order of the pole, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that the function (z - 2i)^n * f(z) has a non-zero limit as z approaches 2i.\n\nLet's consider n = 1:\n\nlim (z→2i) [(z - 2i)^1 * f(z)]\n= lim (z→2i) [(z - 2i) * (z^3 + 3z^2 - 2)/(z - 2i)]\n\nSince (z - 2i) cancels out, we have:\n\n= lim (z→2i) (z^3 + 3z^2 - 2)\n\nNow, substitute z = 2i:\n\n= (2i)^3 + 3(2i)^2 - 2\n= -8i + 12 - 2\n= -8i + 10\n\nSince the limit is non-zero, the order of the pole at z = 2i is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) has a pole of order 1 at z = 2i."
