    "message_1": "Suppose a committee of 5 people needs to be formed from a pool of 10 people consisting of 5 men and 5 women. How many ways are there to form the committee with 2 men, 2 women, and 1 person of any gender?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nFirst, we need to choose 2 men from the 5 men available. This can be done in C(5, 2) ways.\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10 ways\n\nNext, we need to choose 2 women from the 5 women available. This can be done in C(5, 2) ways.\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10 ways\n\nNow, we need to choose 1 person of any gender from the remaining 6 people (3 men and 3 women). This can be done in C(6, 1) ways.\nC(6, 1) = 6! / (1!(6-1)!) = 6 ways\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to choose 2 men, 2 women, and 1 person of any gender to get the total number of ways to form the committee.\nTotal ways = 10 (ways to choose 2 men) * 10 (ways to choose 2 women) * 6 (ways to choose 1 person of any gender) = 600 ways."
