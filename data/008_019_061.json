    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n6x + 4yi = 16 + 14i\n\nSecond equation * 3:\n6x + 15yi = 3 + 12i\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate x:\n\n(6x + 15yi) - (6x + 4yi) = (3 + 12i) - (16 + 14i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n11yi = -13 - 2i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 11i:\n\ny = (-13 - 2i) / 11i\n\nTo get rid of the complex number in the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 11i, which is -11i:\n\ny = (-13 - 2i)(-11i) / (11i)(-11i)\n\ny = (286i - 22) / 121\n\nSo, y = -22/121 + (286/121)i\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n3x + 2(-22/121 + 286/121i)i = 8 + 7i\n\n3x - 44/121i + 572/121i^2 = 8 + 7i\n\nSince i^2 = -1, the equation becomes:\n\n3x + 572/121 - 44/121i = 8 + 7i\n\nNow, equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n3x + 572/121 = 8  (Real part)\n-44/121i = 7i  (Imaginary part)\n\nFor the imaginary part, divide both sides by i:\n\n-44/121 = 7\n\nNow, multiply both sides by -1/7:\n\n44/121 = -1\n\nSo, x = -44/121\n\nNow we have the values for x and y:\n\nx = -44/121\ny = -22/121 + (286/121)i\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = -44/121\ny = -22/121 + (286/121)i"
