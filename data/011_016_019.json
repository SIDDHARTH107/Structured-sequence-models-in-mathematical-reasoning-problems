    "message_1": "A school is organizing a field trip to a museum. There are 5 teachers and 60 students who want to attend. The museum requires that there is at least 1 teacher per group and no more than 15 students per group. How many different ways can the school divide into smaller groups that satisfy these conditions?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible group combinations that satisfy the conditions:\n\n1. 5 groups with 1 teacher and 12 students each: This satisfies the condition of having at least 1 teacher per group and no more than 15 students per group. There are 5 teachers and 60 students, so this is a valid combination.\n\n2. 4 groups with 1 teacher and 15 students each, and 1 group with 1 teacher and no students: This satisfies the condition of having at least 1 teacher per group. However, it does not satisfy the condition of having no more than 15 students per group, as there are 4 groups with 15 students each. Therefore, this combination is not valid.\n\n3. 3 groups with 1 teacher and 20 students each, and 2 groups with 1 teacher and no students: This does not satisfy the condition of having no more than 15 students per group, as there are 3 groups with 20 students each. Therefore, this combination is not valid.\n\nBased on the analysis, there is only 1 valid combination: 5 groups with 1 teacher and 12 students each."
