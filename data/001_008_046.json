    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 ≥ 13, follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality:\n   2x + 3 - 3 ≥ 13 - 3\n   2x ≥ 10\n\n2. Divide both sides of the inequality by 2:\n   2x/2 ≥ 10/2\n   x ≥ 5\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the inequality are x ≥ 5."
