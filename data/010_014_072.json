    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups of the product space X × Y, we can use the Künneth formula, which relates the cohomology groups of the product space to the cohomology groups of the individual spaces X and Y. The Künneth formula states that:\n\nH^k(X × Y) ≅ ⊕_(i+j=k) (H^i(X) ⊗ H^j(Y))\n\nHere, ⊕ denotes the direct sum, and ⊗ denotes the tensor product. We are interested in the case k = n + m. Using the Künneth formula, we have:\n\nH^(n+m)(X × Y) ≅ ⊕_(i+j=n+m) (H^i(X) ⊗ H^j(Y))\n\nSince H^i(X) and H^j(Y) are non-zero only when i = n and j = m, the only non-zero term in the direct sum is:\n\nH^n(X) ⊗ H^m(Y)\n\nTherefore, the cohomology group H^(n+m)(X × Y) is isomorphic to the tensor product of the cohomology groups H^n(X) and H^m(Y):\n\nH^(n+m)(X × Y) ≅ H^n(X) ⊗ H^m(Y)"
