    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 4 and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. Let's analyze the possibilities for these subgroups and the elements of G.\n\n1. Elements of order 2:\n\nSince P is a group of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2 (the cyclic group of order 4 or the Klein 4-group). If P is isomorphic to C4, then it has one element of order 2 (the square of the generator). If P is isomorphic to C2 × C2, then it has three elements of order 2.\n\n2. Elements of order 3:\n\nSince Q is a group of order 3, it must be isomorphic to C3 (the cyclic group of order 3). Thus, Q has one element of order 3 (the generator) and one element of order 3 (the square of the generator).\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for G based on the number of elements of order 2 and 3:\n\nCase 1: G has one element of order 2 and two elements of order 3.\n\nIn this case, P is isomorphic to C4, and G has 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 distinct elements: the identity, one element of order 2, and two elements of order 3. Since G has 12 elements, there must be 12 - 4 = 8 more elements in G. However, this is not possible since the remaining elements would have to be of order 4, but G cannot have more than one cyclic subgroup of order 4. This case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: G has three elements of order 2 and two elements of order 3.\n\nIn this case, P is isomorphic to C2 × C2, and G has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 distinct elements: the identity, three elements of order 2, and two elements of order 3. Since G has 12 elements, there must be 12 - 6 = 6 more elements in G. These elements must be of order 6 since they cannot be of order 2 or 3. Therefore, G has a subgroup of order 6, which must be normal since it has index 2. Let H be this subgroup.\n\nNow, we have |P ∩ H| = 1 since P has only elements of order 2 and H has only elements of order 6 and the identity. By the second isomorphism theorem, we have G/P ∩ H ≅ (G × P)/H, so G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P and H. Since P is isomorphic to C2 × C2 and H is isomorphic to C6, G must be isomorphic to either C12 (the cyclic group of order 12) or D6 (the dihedral group of order 12).\n\nCase 3: G has no elements of order 2 and three elements of order 3.\n\nIn this case, G has 1 + 3 = 4 distinct elements: the identity and three elements of order 3. Since G has 12 elements, there must be 12 - 4 = 8 more elements in G. However, this is not possible since the remaining elements would have to be of order 4, but G cannot have more than one cyclic subgroup of order 4. This case is not possible.\n\nThus, we have shown that G must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6."
