    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material initially contains 1000 grams. The material has a half-life of 10 years. Write a differential equation that models the decay of the material and use it to find the amount of material remaining after 20 years.",
    "message_2": "To model the decay of the radioactive material, we can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nA(t) = A0 * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere A(t) is the amount of material remaining after time t, A0 is the initial amount of material, k is the decay constant, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nFirst, we need to find the decay constant k. We know that the half-life of the material is 10 years, so after 10 years, half of the material will remain:\n\nA(10) = 1000 * e^(-10k) = 1000/2 = 500\n\nNow we can solve for k:\n\n500 = 1000 * e^(-10k)\n1/2 = e^(-10k)\nln(1/2) = -10k\nk = -ln(1/2) / 10 ≈ 0.0693\n\nNow that we have the decay constant k, we can write the differential equation that models the decay of the material:\n\nA(t) = 1000 * e^(-0.0693t)\n\nTo find the amount of material remaining after 20 years, we can plug t = 20 into the equation:\n\nA(20) = 1000 * e^(-0.0693 * 20) ≈ 1000 * e^(-1.386) ≈ 250 grams\n\nSo after 20 years, there will be approximately 250 grams of the radioactive material remaining."
