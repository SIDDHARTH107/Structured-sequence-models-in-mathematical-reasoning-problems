    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has the order as the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. According to the Sylow theorems, we can find the Sylow subgroups for these prime factors.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35. Let n_5 and n_7 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G, respectively.\n\nBy Sylow's first theorem, there exists a subgroup of G with order 5 and a subgroup of G with order 7.\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, we have:\n1. n_5 divides 7 and n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n2. n_7 divides 5 and n_7 is congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n\nFrom the first condition, n_5 can only be 1. This means there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, which we will call P_5.\n\nFrom the second condition, n_7 can only be 1. This means there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup, which we will call P_7.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they are both normal subgroups of G (as any conjugate of a Sylow p-subgroup is also a Sylow p-subgroup, and there is only one of each, they must be invariant under conjugation).\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of P_5 and P_7. Since their orders are prime and distinct, their intersection can only be the identity element. Therefore, P_5 and P_7 have trivial intersection.\n\nSince P_5 and P_7 are both normal subgroups of G with trivial intersection, we can apply the following result:\n\nIf H and K are normal subgroups of a group G with trivial intersection, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K.\n\nIn our case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_5 and P_7. Since P_5 and P_7 are cyclic groups of order 5 and 7, respectively (as they are groups of prime order), G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups.\n\nAlternatively, if we can show that G is generated by the elements of P_5 and P_7, then G is a cyclic group. However, in this case, we have shown that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups."
