The half-life of Uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years. \n\na) Determine the amount of Uranium-238 that will remain after 13.5 billion years.\n\nb) How many half-lives have passed after 13.5 billion years? \n\nc) What was the initial mass of the sample if 20 grams remains after 4.5 billion years?",
    "message_2": "a) To determine the amount of Uranium-238 that will remain after 13.5 billion years, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nFinal mass = 80 grams * (1/2)^(13.5 billion years / 4.5 billion years)\n\nFinal mass = 80 grams * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 80 grams * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 10 grams\n\nSo, 10 grams of Uranium-238 will remain after 13.5 billion years.\n\nb) To find out how many half-lives have passed after 13.5 billion years, we can simply divide the time elapsed by the half-life:\n\nNumber of half-lives = Time elapsed / Half-life\n\nNumber of half-lives = 13.5 billion years / 4.5 billion years\n\nNumber of half-lives = 3\n\nSo, 3 half-lives have passed after 13.5 billion years.\n\nc) To find the initial mass of the sample if 20 grams remains after 4.5 billion years, we can use the same formula as in part a, but rearrange it to solve for the initial mass:\n\nInitial mass = Final mass / (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nInitial mass = 20 grams / (1/2)^(4.5 billion years / 4.5 billion years)\n\nInitial mass = 20 grams / (1/2)^1\n\nInitial mass = 20 grams / 0.5\n\nInitial mass = 40 grams\n\nSo, the initial mass of the sample was 40 grams."
