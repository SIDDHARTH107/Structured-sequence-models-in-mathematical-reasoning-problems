    "message_2": "To find the number of perfect matchings in a graph, we can use the Tutte's theorem, which states that a graph G has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of vertices, the number of vertices in the odd components of G-U is less than or equal to the number of vertices in U.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific graph, we cannot determine the number of perfect matchings. The graph could be a complete graph, a bipartite graph, or have some other structure that affects the number of perfect matchings.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the graph, we can help you find the number of perfect matchings."
