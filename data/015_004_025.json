    "message_2": "The largest cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is the main cardioid, which is the region connected to the origin. The area of the main cardioid can be found using the formula for the area of a cardioid:\n\nArea = (1/2)πa²\n\nwhere a is the length of the major axis of the cardioid. For the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set, the length of the major axis is 1/4. Therefore, the area of the largest cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is:\n\nArea = (1/2)π(1/4)² = (1/2)π(1/16) = π/32 ≈ 0.09817477042"
