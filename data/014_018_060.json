    "message_2": "To decrypt the message \"DlroW olleH\", we need to reverse the substitution applied. Since 'A' is replaced by 'D', it means that each letter is shifted 3 positions forward in the alphabet. To decrypt, we need to shift each letter 3 positions backward.\n\nD -> A\nl -> i\nr -> o\no -> l\nW -> T\n(space remains the same)\no -> l\nl -> i\nl -> i\ne -> b\nH -> E\n\nSo, the original message is \"AiolT llibE\". However, this doesn't seem to make sense. It's possible that the message is reversed. Reversing the decrypted message, we get \"EbillT loiaA\". This still doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's try shifting the letters 3 positions forward instead of backward, as the initial assumption might have been incorrect.\n\nD -> G\nl -> o\nr -> u\no -> r\nW -> Z\n(space remains the same)\no -> r\nl -> o\nl -> o\ne -> h\nH -> K\n\nThe decrypted message is \"GourZ roohK\". Reversing this message, we get \"Khoor ZruoG\". This still doesn't make sense.\n\nIt seems that the initial information about 'A' being replaced by 'D' might not be accurate or applicable to this specific encrypted message. The message \"DlroW olleH\" is a simple reverse of the original message \"Hello World\"."
