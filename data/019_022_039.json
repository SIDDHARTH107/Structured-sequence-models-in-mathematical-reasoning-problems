Option B has a 60% chance of making a profit of $120,000 and a 40% chance of making a loss of $80,000. \n\nAssuming the company can only choose one option, which one should they choose based on the expected monetary value?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option the company should choose based on the expected monetary value, we need to calculate the expected value for each option.\n\nExpected value (EV) is calculated as follows: EV = (probability of outcome 1) * (value of outcome 1) + (probability of outcome 2) * (value of outcome 2)\n\nFor Option A:\nEV_A = (0.7 * $100,000) + (0.3 * -$50,000)\nEV_A = ($70,000) + (-$15,000)\nEV_A = $55,000\n\nFor Option B:\nEV_B = (0.6 * $120,000) + (0.4 * -$80,000)\nEV_B = ($72,000) + (-$32,000)\nEV_B = $40,000\n\nBased on the expected monetary value, the company should choose Option A, as it has a higher expected value of $55,000 compared to Option B's expected value of $40,000."
