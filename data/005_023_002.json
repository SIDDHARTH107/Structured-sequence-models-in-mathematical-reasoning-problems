    "message_2": "To determine the outlier threshold using the 1.5 interquartile range (IQR) rule, we first need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the dataset. Since we only have the mean and standard deviation, we cannot directly calculate the quartiles. However, we can use the empirical rule to approximate the quartiles.\n\nThe empirical rule states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. Since the dataset is not given, we will assume that the distribution of heights is approximately normal.\n\nUsing the empirical rule, we can estimate the first quartile (Q1) to be around the 25th percentile and the third quartile (Q3) to be around the 75th percentile. \n\nFor a normal distribution, the 25th percentile is approximately at the mean minus 0.675 standard deviations, and the 75th percentile is approximately at the mean plus 0.675 standard deviations.\n\nQ1 = mean - 0.675 * standard deviation\nQ1 = 66 - 0.675 * 3\nQ1 ≈ 64\n\nQ3 = mean + 0.675 * standard deviation\nQ3 = 66 + 0.675 * 3\nQ3 ≈ 68\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\nIQR = 68 - 64\nIQR = 4\n\nNext, we'll find the outlier thresholds using the 1.5 IQR rule:\n\nLower outlier threshold = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\nLower outlier threshold = 64 - 1.5 * 4\nLower outlier threshold = 64 - 6\nLower outlier threshold = 58\n\nUpper outlier threshold = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\nUpper outlier threshold = 68 + 1.5 * 4\nUpper outlier threshold = 68 + 6\nUpper outlier threshold = 74\n\nSo, the outlier threshold for this dataset is between 58 inches and 74 inches. Any height below 58 inches or above 74 inches would be considered an outlier."
