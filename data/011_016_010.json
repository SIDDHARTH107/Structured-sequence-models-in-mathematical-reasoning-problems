    "message_2": "In a round-robin tournament with 7 teams, we can use the formula for combinations to determine the number of matches played. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams and k is the number of teams playing in each match (which is 2 in this case).\n\nSo, for our problem:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!5!)\nC(7, 2) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / (2*1*5*4*3*2*1)\nC(7, 2) = (7*6) / (2*1)\nC(7, 2) = 42 / 2\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nTherefore, 21 matches will be played during the tournament."
