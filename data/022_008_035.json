Since w = ±sqrt(1/3), we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: w = sqrt(1/3)\n\ne^(iz) = sqrt(1/3)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\niz = ln(sqrt(1/3)) + 2πni\n\nDividing by i:\n\nz = -i * ln(sqrt(1/3)) + 2πn\n\nCase 2: w = -sqrt(1/3)\n\ne^(iz) = -sqrt(1/3)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\niz = ln(-sqrt(1/3)) + (2k + 1)πi\n\nDividing by i:\n\nz = -i * ln(-sqrt(1/3)) + (2k + 1)π\n\nCombining both cases, we have the general solution for z:\n\nz = -i * ln(sqrt(1/3)) + 2πn (for integers n)\nz = -i * ln(-sqrt(1/3)) + (2k + 1)π (for integers k)\n\nThese are all the values of z such that sin(z) = i."
