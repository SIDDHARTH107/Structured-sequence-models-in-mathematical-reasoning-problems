    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = beta * x(t-tau) / (a + x(t-tau)^n) - gamma * x(t)\n\nTo find the equilibrium point, we need to find the value of x(t) when dx(t)/dt = 0. At equilibrium, x(t) = x(t-tau) = x_eq. So, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = beta * x_eq / (a + x_eq^n) - gamma * x_eq\n\nNow, we can plug in the given parameter values:\n\n0 = 0.2 * x_eq / (0.1 + x_eq^10) - 0.1 * x_eq\n\nTo solve for x_eq, we can use numerical methods, such as the bisection method or Newton's method, as the equation is highly nonlinear and does not have a simple closed-form solution. Using a numerical solver, we find that:\n\nx_eq â‰ˆ 1.2267\n\nSo, the equilibrium point of the Mackey-Glass equation with the given parameters is approximately x_eq = 1.2267."
