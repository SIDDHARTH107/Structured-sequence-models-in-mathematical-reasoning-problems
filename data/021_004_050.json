Using the forward difference formula with a step size of h = 0.5, compute the approximate values of the first derivative of f at x = 1.5 and x = 2.5. Also, use the central difference formula with the same step size to compute the approximate value of the second derivative of f at x = 2.",
    "message_2": "To compute the approximate values of the first derivative of f at x = 1.5 and x = 2.5 using the forward difference formula, we use the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere h = 0.5.\n\nFor x = 1.5:\nf(1.5) = 2(1.5)^3 - 5(1.5)^2 + 3(1.5) - 1 = -1.875\nf(1.5 + 0.5) = f(2) = 2(2)^3 - 5(2)^2 + 3(2) - 1 = -7\nf'(1.5) ≈ (f(2) - f(1.5)) / 0.5 = (-7 - (-1.875)) / 0.5 = -10.25\n\nFor x = 2.5:\nf(2.5) = 2(2.5)^3 - 5(2.5)^2 + 3(2.5) - 1 = -12.625\nf(2.5 + 0.5) = f(3) = 2(3)^3 - 5(3)^2 + 3(3) - 1 = -19\nf'(2.5) ≈ (f(3) - f(2.5)) / 0.5 = (-19 - (-12.625)) / 0.5 = -12.75\n\nNow, to compute the approximate value of the second derivative of f at x = 2 using the central difference formula, we use the formula:\n\nf''(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - 2f(x) + f(x - h)) / h^2\n\nFor x = 2:\nf(2 - 0.5) = f(1.5) = -1.875\nf(2) = -7\nf(2 + 0.5) = f(2.5) = -12.625\nf''(2) ≈ (f(2.5) - 2f(2) + f(1.5)) / 0.5^2 = (-12.625 - 2(-7) + (-1.875)) / 0.25 = -10\n\nSo, the approximate values of the first derivative of f at x = 1.5 and x = 2.5 are -10.25 and -12.75, respectively, and the approximate value of the second derivative of f at x = 2 is -10."
