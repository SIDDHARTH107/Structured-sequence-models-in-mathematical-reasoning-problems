    "message_2": "First, let's consider the case when the number of elements in G of order 2 is odd. Since the identity element has order 1, there must be an even number of non-identity elements in G. Thus, there must be an element of order 4 in G. Let x be an element of order 4, so x^4 = 1.\n\nNow, let y be an element of order 2 in G. Then, y^2 = 1, and (yx)^2 = y^2x^2 = 1. Since x and y are not equal to the identity, yx ≠ 1. Thus, yx has order 2. Notice that yx ≠ x, since otherwise y = 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are at least three elements of order 2 in G: y, yx, and (yx)^2 = x^2.\n\nSince G has order 8, there are 4 remaining elements. Let z be one of these elements. Then, z cannot have order 1, 2, or 4, since we have already accounted for all elements of those orders. Therefore, z must have order 8. But then G is generated by z, so G is a cyclic group of order 8, which contradicts the assumption that the number of elements of order 2 is odd.\n\nThus, G must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, which has an odd number of elements of order 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when the number of elements in G of order 2 is even. If G has an element of order 8, then G is generated by that element and is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.\n\nIf G does not have an element of order 8, then all non-identity elements in G must have order 2 or 4. Since the number of elements of order 2 is even, there must be an element of order 4. Let x be an element of order 4, so x^4 = 1.\n\nLet y be an element in G not equal to 1, x, x^2, or x^3. Then, y^2 = 1, since y cannot have order 4 (otherwise, G would be cyclic). Now, consider the element z = xy. Then, z^2 = (xy)^2 = xyxy = x^2y^2 = x^2, since y^2 = 1. Thus, z has order 4.\n\nNow, we have the following relations: x^4 = y^2 = (xy)^2 = 1, and yx = x^3y. These are precisely the relations satisfied by the quaternion group Q8. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, if the number of elements in G of order 2 is odd, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4. If the number of elements in G of order 2 is even, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8 or the quaternion group Q8."
