    "message_1": "A metal ring with an outer radius of 8 cm and a cross-sectional radius of 2 cm is rotated about an axis in the plane of the ring. Determine the volume of the resulting torus.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π * R * π * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the cross-sectional circle (outer radius - cross-sectional radius), and r is the cross-sectional radius.\n\nR = 8 cm - 2 cm = 6 cm\nr = 2 cm\n\nNow, plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π * 6 cm * π * (2 cm)^2\nVolume = 2 * π * 6 cm * π * 4 cm^2\nVolume = 48π^2 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the resulting torus is 48π^2 cubic centimeters."
