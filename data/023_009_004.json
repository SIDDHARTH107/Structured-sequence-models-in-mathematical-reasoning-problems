Using the Fourier transform, find the steady-state temperature distribution of the rod if the two ends are held at fixed temperatures of 1 and 3 degrees Celsius, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution of the rod, we need to solve the heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the material and t is time. In the steady-state, the temperature distribution does not change with time, so ∂T(x,t) / ∂t = 0. Thus, we have:\n\n0 = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation with the given boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = 1\nT(1) = 3\n\nLet's assume the steady-state temperature distribution is given by T(x) = Ax² + Bx + C. Then, the second derivative with respect to x is:\n\n∂²T(x) / ∂x² = 2A\n\nSince the steady-state temperature distribution satisfies the heat equation, we have:\n\n0 = α * 2A\n\nSince α is a non-zero constant (thermal diffusivity), we can conclude that A = 0. Therefore, the steady-state temperature distribution is given by:\n\nT(x) = Bx + C\n\nNow, we can use the boundary conditions to solve for B and C:\n\nT(0) = 1 => C = 1\nT(1) = 3 => B + C = 3\n\nSince C = 1, we have B = 2. Thus, the steady-state temperature distribution of the rod is:\n\nT(x) = 2x + 1"
