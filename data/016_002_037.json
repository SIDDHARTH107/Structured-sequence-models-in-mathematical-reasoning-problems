    "message_2": "The Koch Snowflake is a fractal that is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. After each iteration, the number of sides of the snowflake increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Koch Snowflake after n iterations as P(n). The perimeter after 0 iterations (the starting equilateral triangle) is P(0) = 3 * 3 = 9 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter after 4 iterations:\n\n1. After the first iteration, the number of sides is 3 * 4 = 12, and the length of each side is 3 * (1/3) = 1 cm. So, P(1) = 12 * 1 = 12 cm.\n2. After the second iteration, the number of sides is 12 * 4 = 48, and the length of each side is 1 * (1/3) = 1/3 cm. So, P(2) = 48 * (1/3) = 16 cm.\n3. After the third iteration, the number of sides is 48 * 4 = 192, and the length of each side is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 cm. So, P(3) = 192 * (1/9) = 64/3 cm.\n4. After the fourth iteration, the number of sides is 192 * 4 = 768, and the length of each side is (1/9) * (1/3) = 1/27 cm. So, P(4) = 768 * (1/27) = 256/9 cm.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the Koch Snowflake after 4 iterations, with the starting equilateral triangle having sides of length 3 cm, is 256/9 cm or approximately 28.44 cm."
