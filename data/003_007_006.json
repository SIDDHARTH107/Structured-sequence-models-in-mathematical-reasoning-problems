    "message_2": "To find the length of side XZ, we can use the Law of Cosines. First, we need to find the measure of ∠Z. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we can find ∠Z as follows:\n\n∠Z = 180° - (∠X + ∠Y) = 180° - (35° + 75°) = 180° - 110° = 70°\n\nNow, we can apply the Law of Cosines to find the length of side XZ. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we want to find the length of side XZ (c), and we have the following information:\n\na = XY = 8\nb = YZ (unknown)\nC = ∠Z = 70°\n\nWe are given only one side length, so we cannot directly apply the Law of Cosines. However, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side YZ (b) first, and then apply the Law of Cosines to find the length of side XZ (c).\n\nThe Law of Sines states:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe can use the given information to find the length of side YZ (b) using the Law of Sines:\n\n8/sin(35°) = b/sin(75°)\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb = (8 * sin(75°))/sin(35°)\n\nb ≈ 11.45\n\nNow that we have the length of side YZ (b), we can apply the Law of Cosines to find the length of side XZ (c):\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\nc² = 8² + 11.45² - 2(8)(11.45) * cos(70°)\nc² ≈ 64 + 131.10 - 183.20 * 0.342\nc² ≈ 195.10 - 62.65\nc² ≈ 132.45\n\nNow, we can find the length of side XZ (c) by taking the square root of c²:\n\nc = √132.45\nc ≈ 11.50\n\nSo, the length of side XZ is approximately 11.50 units."
