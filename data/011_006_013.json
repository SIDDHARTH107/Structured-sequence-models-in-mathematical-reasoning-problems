    "message_1": "Suppose you have four different types of chocolates: milk, dark, white, and caramel. If you want to pick 8 chocolates in total, how many different ways can you choose them if you want at least 2 of each type? Use generating functions to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to represent each type of chocolate with a generating function. Since we want at least 2 of each type, we can represent the generating functions for each type of chocolate as follows:\n\nMilk chocolate: M(x) = x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + ... (since we want at least 2 milk chocolates)\nDark chocolate: D(x) = x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + ... (since we want at least 2 dark chocolates)\nWhite chocolate: W(x) = x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + ... (since we want at least 2 white chocolates)\nCaramel chocolate: C(x) = x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + ... (since we want at least 2 caramel chocolates)\n\nNow, we need to find the generating function for the total number of ways to choose 8 chocolates with at least 2 of each type. We can do this by multiplying the generating functions for each type of chocolate:\n\nT(x) = M(x) * D(x) * W(x) * C(x)\n\nSince M(x), D(x), W(x), and C(x) are all the same, we can rewrite T(x) as:\n\nT(x) = (x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + ...)^4\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of x^8 in T(x), which will give us the total number of ways to choose 8 chocolates with at least 2 of each type.\n\nT(x) = (x^2(1 + x + x^2 + ...))^4\n\nUsing the geometric series formula, we can rewrite T(x) as:\n\nT(x) = (x^2(1/(1-x)))^4\n\nNow, we can use the binomial theorem to expand T(x):\n\nT(x) = (x^8) * (1/(1-x))^4\n\nWe need to find the coefficient of x^8 in the expansion of (1/(1-x))^4. Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\n(1/(1-x))^4 = C(3,0) * x^0 + C(4,1) * x^1 + C(5,2) * x^2 + ... + C(11,8) * x^8 + ...\n\nThe coefficient of x^8 in the expansion is C(11,8) = 11!/(8!3!) = 165.\n\nTherefore, there are 165 different ways to choose 8 chocolates with at least 2 of each type."
