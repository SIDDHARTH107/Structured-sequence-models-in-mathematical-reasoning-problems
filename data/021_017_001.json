    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: A and B. The production of product A requires 3 units of raw material and 2 units of labor, while the production of product B requires 2 units of raw material and 4 units of labor. Each unit of product A is sold for $60, and each unit of product B is sold for $80. The company has a total of 240 units of raw material and 320 units of labor available for production.\n\nDesign an optimization model that will help the company determine how many units of each product to produce in order to maximize profit. Use differential evolution algorithm to solve this optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To design an optimization model, we first need to define the objective function and constraints. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function is the total profit, which we want to maximize:\n\nObjective function: P(x, y) = 60x + 80y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 240\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 320\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can use the differential evolution algorithm to solve this optimization problem. Differential evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm that works by evolving a population of candidate solutions over several generations. Here's a general outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions randomly within the feasible region.\n2. For each generation, create a new population by applying mutation, crossover, and selection operators.\n3. Repeat step 2 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of generations or a minimum improvement in the objective function).\n\nIn Python, we can use the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function to solve this problem. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\n# Define the objective function\ndef objective_function(x):\n    return -1 * (60 * x[0] + 80 * x[1])\n\n# Define the constraints\nbounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]\nconstraints = (\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 240 - (3 * x[0] + 2 * x[1])},\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 320 - (2 * x[0] + 4 * x[1])}\n)\n\n# Solve the optimization problem using differential evolution\nresult = differential_evolution(\n    objective_function,\n    bounds=bounds,\n    constraints=constraints,\n    strategy='best1bin',\n    maxiter=1000,\n    popsize=50,\n    tol=1e-6,\n    mutation=(0.5, 1),\n    recombination=0.7,\n    seed=42\n)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Optimal number of units of product A: {result.x[0]:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Optimal number of units of product B: {result.x[1]:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Maximum profit: ${-1 * result.fun:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the optimal number of units of product A and B to produce, as well as the maximum profit. Note that the actual implementation of the differential evolution algorithm is beyond the scope of this answer, but the provided code should be sufficient to solve the given problem."
