    "message_1": "A market researcher conducts a survey on 200 consumers, asking them about their preference for a particular brand of toothpaste. The results show that 120 consumers prefer the brand. What is the probability that a randomly selected consumer from the market prefers the brand?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected consumer prefers the brand, we need to divide the number of consumers who prefer the brand (120) by the total number of consumers surveyed (200).\n\nProbability = (Number of consumers who prefer the brand) / (Total number of consumers surveyed)\n\nProbability = 120 / 200\n\nProbability = 0.6 or 60%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected consumer from the market prefers the brand is 60%."
