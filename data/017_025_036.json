The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2^3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 2^3 * 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1, 6, or 24.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow subgroups.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow subgroups P_2, P_3, and P_5 of orders 8, 3, and 5, respectively. Since they are unique, they are normal in G. The product of P_2, P_3, and P_5 has order 120, so G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5. There are 5 groups of order 8 (4 abelian and 1 non-abelian), so this case gives us 5 non-isomorphic groups.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 ≠ 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, both normal in G. However, G has more than one Sylow 5-subgroup. Since P_2 and P_3 are normal, we can consider the direct product P_2 × P_3, which is a normal subgroup of G of order 24. By the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have G/(P_2 × P_3) isomorphic to a subgroup of order 5. This implies that G has a normal subgroup of order 5, contradicting our assumption that n_5 ≠ 1. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 ≠ 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both normal in G. However, G has more than one Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P_2 and P_5 are normal, we can consider the direct product P_2 × P_5, which is a normal subgroup of G of order 40. By the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have G/(P_2 × P_5) isomorphic to a subgroup of order 3. This implies that G has a normal subgroup of order 3, contradicting our assumption that n_3 ≠ 1. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 4: n_2 ≠ 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 and Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both normal in G. However, G has more than one Sylow 2-subgroup. Since P_3 and P_5 are normal, we can consider the direct product P_3 × P_5, which is a normal subgroup of G of order 15. By the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have G/(P_3 × P_5) isomorphic to a subgroup of order 8. This implies that G has a normal subgroup of order 8, contradicting our assumption that n_2 ≠ 1. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 5: n_2 ≠ 1, n_3 ≠ 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, which is normal in G. The factor group G/P_5 has order 24. There are 15 groups of order 24, but only 3 of them have more than one Sylow 3-subgroup: the symmetric group S_4, the special linear group SL(2,3), and the direct product (C_2 × C_2) × A_4. In each of these cases, the Sylow 5-subgroup can be extended to a group of order 120, giving us 3 non-isomorphic groups.\n\nCase 6: n_2 ≠ 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 ≠ 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, which is normal in G. The factor group G/P_3 has order 40. There are 14 groups of order 40, but only 4 of them have more than one Sylow 5-subgroup: the direct product (C_2 × C_2) × (C_5 × C_4), (C_2 × C_2) × D_20, (C_2 × C_2) × (C_5 : C_4), and (C_2 × C_2) × Q_20. In each of these cases, the Sylow 3-subgroup can be extended to a group of order 120, giving us 4 non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn total, we have found 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 non-isomorphic groups of order 120. However, there is one more group of order 120 that we have not considered: the alternating group A_5. This group is simple and has order 120, so it is not isomorphic to any of the groups we have found so far.\n\nThus, there exist exactly 13 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
