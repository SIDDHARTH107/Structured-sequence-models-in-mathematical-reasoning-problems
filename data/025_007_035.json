Let $H^i(X,\\mathcal{O}_X(L))$ denote the $i$th sheaf cohomology group of $\\mathcal{O}_X(L)$. \n\nSuppose $L$ is an ample bundle and $H^i(X,\\mathcal{O}_X(L))=0$ for all $i>0$. If the degree of $L$ is $d$, what is the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X,\\mathcal{O}_X(L))$ of the sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_X(L)$ in terms of $d$?",
    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a sheaf is defined as the alternating sum of the dimensions of its cohomology groups:\n\n$$\\chi(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(L)) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(L)).$$\n\nSince $H^i(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(L)) = 0$ for all $i > 0$, the Euler characteristic simplifies to:\n\n$$\\chi(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(L)) = \\dim H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(L)).$$\n\nNow, by the Riemann-Roch theorem for line bundles on a projective variety, we have:\n\n$$\\chi(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(L)) = \\int_X c_1(L)^n,$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the dimension of $X$ and $c_1(L)$ is the first Chern class of the line bundle $L$. Since $L$ has degree $d$, we have $c_1(L) = d$. Therefore, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\n$$\\chi(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(L)) = \\int_X d^n = d^n \\int_X 1.$$\n\nThe integral of 1 over $X$ is equal to the degree of the fundamental class of $X$, which is 1 for a projective variety. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\\chi(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(L)) = d^n.$$"
