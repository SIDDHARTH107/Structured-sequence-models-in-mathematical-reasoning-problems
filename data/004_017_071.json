    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve y = 2x^(3/2) + 3x between x = 0 and x = 4, we need to use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = 2x^(3/2) + 3x\ndy/dx = (3/2) * 2x^(1/2) + 3\n\nNow, let's find the square of the derivative:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = [(3x^(1/2) + 3)^2]\n\nNext, we add 1 to the square of the derivative:\n\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (3x^(1/2) + 3)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of the expression:\n\nsqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = sqrt(1 + (3x^(1/2) + 3)^2)\n\nFinally, we integrate the expression with respect to x from 0 to 4:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + (3x^(1/2) + 3)^2) dx\n\nThis integral does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we need to use numerical methods to approximate the value. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a computer software, we get:\n\nL ≈ 16.882\n\nSo, the length of the curve y = 2x^(3/2) + 3x between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 16.882 units."
