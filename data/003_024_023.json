    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector 𝐀 onto vector 𝐁 using trigonometry, we need to find the angle between the two vectors and then use the dot product formula. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Find the angle between 𝐀 and 𝐁:\nFirst, we need to find the magnitudes of 𝐀 and 𝐁:\n\n‖𝐀‖ = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n‖𝐁‖ = √(1² + 2²) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of 𝐀 and 𝐁:\n\n𝐀 · 𝐁 = (3 * 1) + (4 * 2) = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nUsing the dot product formula, we can find the angle θ between 𝐀 and 𝐁:\n\ncos(θ) = (𝐀 · 𝐁) / (‖𝐀‖ * ‖𝐁‖)\ncos(θ) = 11 / (5 * √5)\nθ = arccos(11 / (5 * √5))\n\n2. Find the projection of 𝐀 onto 𝐁:\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the projection of 𝐀 onto 𝐁 using the following formula:\n\nproj_𝐁(𝐀) = ‖𝐀‖ * cos(θ) * (𝐁 / ‖𝐁‖)\n\nproj_𝐁(𝐀) = 5 * (11 / (5 * √5)) * (1/√5, 2/√5)\n\nproj_𝐁(𝐀) = (11/5) * (1, 2)\n\nproj_𝐁(𝐀) = (11/5, 22/5)\n\nSo, the projection of vector 𝐀 onto vector 𝐁 is (11/5, 22/5)."
