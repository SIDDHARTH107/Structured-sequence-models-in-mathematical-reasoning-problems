    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(3x+5) = 7, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(3x+5))^2 = 7^2\n\n2. Simplify both sides of the equation.\n3x + 5 = 49\n\n3. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.\n3x = 44\n\n4. Divide both sides of the equation by 3.\nx = 44/3\n\nSo, the solution for x is x = 44/3."
