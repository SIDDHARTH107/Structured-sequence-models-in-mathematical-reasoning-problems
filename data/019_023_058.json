They found that for the past five years, their customers have been the following ages:\n25, 28, 32, 35, 38, 42, 48, 50, 55\nUsing inductive logic, what is the probability that the age of the next person to purchase their policy will be 60 or older?",
    "message_2": "Using inductive logic, we can analyze the pattern in the given data and make an educated guess about the probability of the next person being 60 or older. \n\nFirst, let's find the differences between consecutive ages:\n28 - 25 = 3\n32 - 28 = 4\n35 - 32 = 3\n38 - 35 = 3\n42 - 38 = 4\n48 - 42 = 6\n50 - 48 = 2\n55 - 50 = 5\n\nThe differences are not consistent, but we can observe that the differences are generally increasing. This suggests that the age of customers is likely to continue increasing. \n\nBased on this pattern, we can estimate that the next difference could be around 6 or higher. If we add 6 to the last age (55), we get 61, which is 60 or older. \n\nHowever, we cannot determine an exact probability using inductive logic alone, as it is based on patterns and not on a mathematical model. To provide a probability, we would need more information or a statistical model to base our prediction on."
