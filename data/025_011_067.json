    "message_1": "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over the field of complex numbers with the following Weierstrass equation: $y^2=x^3+ax+b$, where $a=-7$ and $b=10$. Let $\\phi:E\\rightarrow E$ be an isogeny of degree $3$. What is the equation of the elliptic curve $\\phi(E)$?",
    "message_2": "Given an elliptic curve $E$ with Weierstrass equation $y^2 = x^3 - 7x + 10$, we want to find the equation of the elliptic curve $\\phi(E)$, where $\\phi: E \\rightarrow E$ is an isogeny of degree 3.\n\nFirst, let's compute the discriminant $\\Delta$ of the elliptic curve $E$. The discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$. Plugging in the values of $a$ and $b$, we get:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4(-7)^3 + 27(10)^2) = -16(-1372) = 21952$\n\nSince $\\Delta \\neq 0$, the elliptic curve $E$ is non-singular.\n\nNow, let's compute the j-invariant $j$ of the elliptic curve $E$. The j-invariant is given by the formula $j = 1728 \\frac{4a^3}{4a^3 + 27b^2}$. Plugging in the values of $a$ and $b$, we get:\n\n$j = 1728 \\frac{4(-7)^3}{4(-7)^3 + 27(10)^2} = 1728 \\frac{-1372}{21952} = -108$\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the elliptic curve $\\phi(E)$. Since $\\phi$ is an isogeny of degree 3, the j-invariant of $\\phi(E)$ will be the same as that of $E$. Therefore, we need to find an elliptic curve with j-invariant $-108$.\n\nLet the equation of $\\phi(E)$ be given by $y^2 = x^3 + A x + B$. We can compute the discriminant $\\Delta'$ and j-invariant $j'$ of this curve using the same formulas as before:\n\n$\\Delta' = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$\n\n$j' = 1728 \\frac{4A^3}{4A^3 + 27B^2}$\n\nWe want to find $A$ and $B$ such that $j' = -108$. Plugging in the value of $j'$, we get:\n\n$-108 = 1728 \\frac{4A^3}{4A^3 + 27B^2}$\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$-108(4A^3 + 27B^2) = 1728(4A^3)$\n\nDividing both sides by $-108$, we get:\n\n$4A^3 + 27B^2 = -16A^3$\n\nNow, we have a Diophantine equation in two variables $A$ and $B$. Solving this equation, we find that one possible solution is $(A, B) = (1, -2)$. Therefore, the equation of the elliptic curve $\\phi(E)$ is given by:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + x - 2$"
