    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(27), we need to find the prime factors of 27 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n27 can be factored as 3 × 3 × 3, or 3^3.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as √(3^3). Since there are no pairs of the same factor, we can't simplify it further in terms of whole numbers. However, we can rewrite it as 3√(3) by taking one 3 out of the radical. So, the simplified radical expression is 3√(3)."
