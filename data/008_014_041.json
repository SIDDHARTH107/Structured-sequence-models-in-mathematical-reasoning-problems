    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be represented as follows:\n\nA = | 3  4  2 |\n    | 2 -3  5 |\n    | 1  1  6 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 10  |\n    | -8  |\n    | 16  |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we need to find orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R.\n\n1.

Normalize the orthogonal basis to get the orthonormal basis:\n\nq1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (3, 2, 1) / sqrt(3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = (3/√14, 2/√14, 1/√14)\nq2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (1/14, -37/14, 3/14) / sqrt((1/14)^2 + (-37/14)^2 + (3/14)^2) = (1/√1850, -37/√1850, 3/√1850)\nq3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (0, 1, 4) / sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + 4^2) = (0, 1/√17, 4/√17)\n\n3.
