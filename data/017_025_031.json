    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to one of the given groups, we will use the Sylow theorems and properties of group theory.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for a prime p dividing the order of G is denoted by n_p and satisfies:\n\n1. n_p divides the order of G, and\n2. n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, we have n_2 | 3 * 5, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, we have n_3 | 2^3 * 5, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, we have n_5 | 2^3 * 3, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120:\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C120, then G must have a unique 2-Sylow, 3-Sylow, and 5-Sylow subgroup, as a cyclic group of order 120 has a unique subgroup of each order dividing 120. This means n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1. However, we cannot conclude that G is isomorphic to C120 just based on the Sylow subgroups, as there might be other groups with the same Sylow subgroup structure.\n\n2. G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2:\n\nThe order of A5 × C2 × C2 is 60 * 2 * 2 = 120. The number of 2-Sylow subgroups in A5 × C2 × C2 is 3 (as A5 has n_2 = 3), and the number of 3-Sylow and 5-Sylow subgroups is 1. Thus, if G has n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, it is possible that G is isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2. However, we still cannot conclude this, as there might be other groups with the same Sylow subgroup structure.\n\n3. G is one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120:\n\nIf G is not isomorphic to C120 or A5 × C2 × C2, then it must be one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. Since we cannot conclude that G is isomorphic to C120 or A5 × C2 × C2 based on the Sylow subgroups alone, it is possible that G is one of these non-abelian groups.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot determine with certainty whether G is isomorphic to C120, A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120 just by using the Sylow theorems and properties of group theory. Further information about the structure of G would be needed to make a definite conclusion."
