    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 * 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, and 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 * 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^2 * 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 5, so n_5 can only be 1.\n\nIf n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then G has unique Sylow subgroups of orders 2^2, 3, and 5, say P_2, P_3, and P_5, respectively. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Since the orders of P_2, P_3, and P_5 are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 60. In this case, G is isomorphic to C60.\n\nIf G is not isomorphic to C60, then either n_2 > 1 or n_3 > 1. If n_2 = 3 or 15, then G has more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, and G cannot be abelian. If n_3 = 10, then G has more than one Sylow 3-subgroup, and G cannot be abelian. In either case, G must be non-abelian.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is non-abelian. Since G has order 60, it is not possible to write down its group table directly without more information about the structure of G. However, we can analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems and the fact that G is non-abelian.\n\nIf n_2 = 3 or 15, then G has a non-normal Sylow 2-subgroup, which implies that G is not a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Similarly, if n_3 = 10, then G has a non-normal Sylow 3-subgroup, which also implies that G is not a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. In either case, G cannot be isomorphic to A5 × C2, since A5 × C2 is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nTherefore, if G is non-abelian, it must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. However, without more information about the structure of G, it is not possible to write down its group table."
