    "message_2": "To find the probability that the first player wins the game, we need to calculate the probability of getting at least 4 heads in 6 coin flips. This can happen in the following scenarios:\n\n1. Getting exactly 4 heads\n2. Getting exactly 5 heads\n3. Getting exactly 6 heads\n\nWe will calculate the probability of each scenario and then add them up.\n\n1. Probability of getting exactly 4 heads:\nThere are C(6,4) ways to choose 4 heads out of 6 flips, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. C(6,4) = 6! / (4! * (6-4)!) = 15.\nSince the coin is fair, the probability of getting a head is 1/2 and the probability of getting a tail is also 1/2. So, the probability of getting exactly 4 heads is (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^2 * C(6,4) = 15/64.\n\n2. Probability of getting exactly 5 heads:\nThere are C(6,5) ways to choose 5 heads out of 6 flips. C(6,5) = 6! / (5! * (6-5)!) = 6.\nThe probability of getting exactly 5 heads is (1/2)^5 * (1/2)^1 * C(6,5) = 6/64.\n\n3. Probability of getting exactly 6 heads:\nThere is only 1 way to get 6 heads out of 6 flips. The probability of getting exactly 6 heads is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n\nNow, we add up the probabilities of each scenario:\nP(at least 4 heads) = P(4 heads) + P(5 heads) + P(6 heads) = 15/64 + 6/64 + 1/64 = 22/64.\n\nThe probability that the first player wins the game is 22/64, which can be simplified to 11/32."
