    "message_2": "To disconnect a connected graph, we need to remove enough edges to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate connected components.\n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In our case, with 10 vertices, a tree would have 9 edges. If we remove enough edges to create two trees, the graph will be disconnected.\n\nLet's say we have two trees, one with x vertices and the other with y vertices. The sum of the vertices in both trees must equal the total number of vertices in the graph:\n\nx + y = 10\n\nThe sum of the edges in both trees must equal the total number of edges in the graph minus the number of edges we removed:\n\n(x - 1) + (y - 1) = 15 - k\n\nSubstituting y = 10 - x, we get:\n\n(x - 1) + (10 - x - 1) = 15 - k\nx + 8 - x = 15 - k\n8 = 15 - k\n\nSolving for k, we find that k = 7.\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 7."
