    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 49 and 210 using the Euclidean algorithm, we will perform a series of divisions with remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. Then, the GCD will be the last non-zero remainder. Here's the process:\n\n1. Divide 210 by 49:\n   210 ÷ 49 = 4 with a remainder of 18\n   (210 = 49 * 4 + 18)\n\n2. Now, divide the previous divisor (49) by the remainder (18):\n   49 ÷ 18 = 2 with a remainder of 13\n   (49 = 18 * 2 + 13)\n\n3. Divide the previous remainder (18) by the new remainder (13):\n   18 ÷ 13 = 1 with a remainder of 5\n   (18 = 13 * 1 + 5)\n\n4. Divide the previous remainder (13) by the new remainder (5):\n   13 ÷ 5 = 2 with a remainder of 3\n   (13 = 5 * 2 + 3)\n\n5. Divide the previous remainder (5) by the new remainder (3):\n   5 ÷ 3 = 1 with a remainder of 2\n   (5 = 3 * 1 + 2)\n\n6. Divide the previous remainder (3) by the new remainder (2):\n   3 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 1\n   (3 = 2 * 1 + 1)\n\n7. Divide the previous remainder (2) by the new remainder (1):\n   2 ÷ 1 = 2 with a remainder of 0\n   (2 = 1 * 2 + 0)\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is 1, so the GCD of 49 and 210 is 1."
