    "message_1": "Consider the following optimization problem: \n\nMinimize f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 6 \n\nsubject to the constraint x <= 5 \n\nUse the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to find the value of x that minimizes f(x) within the given constraint. Set up the ABC algorithm with a population size of 20, maximum number of iterations of 100, and limit the number of scouts to 50. Use the uniform distribution for generating the initial population and the onlooker bees.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given optimization problem using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Population size (SN) = 20\n   - Maximum number of iterations (MaxIter) = 100\n   - Limit for scout bees (Limit) = 50\n   - Lower and upper bounds for x (LB, UB) = (0, 5)\n\n2. Generate the initial population of employed bees using a uniform distribution within the given constraint (x <= 5).\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each employed bee using the objective function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 6.\n\n4. For each iteration, perform the following steps:\n   a. Send employed bees to search for new solutions (food sources) in the neighborhood of their current positions.\n   b. Calculate the fitness of the new solutions and apply the greedy selection process to update the positions of employed bees.\n   c. Calculate the probability values for the solutions based on their fitness.\n   d. Send onlooker bees to search for new solutions based on the probability values.\n   e. Calculate the fitness of the new solutions found by onlooker bees and apply the greedy selection process to update their positions.\n   f. Determine the abandoned solution (food source) that has not been improved for the Limit number of iterations and replace it with a new randomly generated solution (scout bee).\n   g. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n5. Repeat step 4 for the maximum number of iterations (MaxIter).\n\n6. The best solution found after the maximum number of iterations is the value of x that minimizes f(x) within the given constraint.\n\nNote that the ABC algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the solution found may not be the exact global minimum. However, it is usually a good approximation of the optimal solution."
