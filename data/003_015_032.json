    "message_1": "The equation of a trigonometric function is given by y = 5 sin(2x - pi/3) + 2. Find the period and amplitude of the function.",
    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given trigonometric function, we need to analyze the equation y = 5 sin(2x - pi/3) + 2.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 5. Therefore, the amplitude of the function is |5| = 5.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 2. The general formula to find the period of a sine function is (2π) / |coefficient of x|.\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function is 5, and the period is π."
