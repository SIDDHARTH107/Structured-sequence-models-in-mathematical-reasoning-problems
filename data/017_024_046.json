    "message_2": "There are 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 96. They are:\n\n1. C96 (Cyclic group of order 96)\n2. C48 × C2\n3. C32 × C3\n4. C24 × C4\n5. C16 × C6\n6. C8 × C12\n7. C4 × C24\n8. C2 × C48\n9. C2 × (C16 × C3)\n10. C2 × (C8 × C4)\n11. C2 × (C4 × C6)\n12. C2 × (C2 × C24)\n13. C2 × (C2 × (C8 × C3))\n14. C2 × (C2 × (C4 × C4))\n15. C2 × (C2 × (C2 × C12))\n\nThese groups are constructed using direct products of cyclic groups of various orders. The numbers in the group names represent the orders of the cyclic groups. For example, C48 × C2 is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 48 and a cyclic group of order 2."
