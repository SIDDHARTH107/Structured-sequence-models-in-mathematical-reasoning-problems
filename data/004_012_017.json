    "message_1": "A certain region has a population of 100,000 people growing at a rate of 2% every year. Find the rate of growth in the population after 5 years using the quotient rule to differentiate the function that models population growth.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the function that models the population growth. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\nP(t) = P₀(1 + r)^t\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P₀ is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in years. In this case, the initial population P₀ is 100,000 and the growth rate r is 2% or 0.02. So the function becomes:\n\nP(t) = 100,000(1 + 0.02)^t\n\nNow we need to find the rate of growth in the population after 5 years, which means we need to find the derivative of P(t) with respect to t, and then evaluate it at t = 5. To differentiate P(t) with respect to t, we can use the quotient rule. However, in this case, it's easier to use the chain rule since there is no quotient involved in the function.\n\nThe chain rule states that if we have a function y = f(g(x)), then the derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nIn our case, we have P(t) = 100,000(1.02)^t, which can be written as P(t) = 100,000(e^(ln(1.02)*t)). Now we can apply the chain rule:\n\ndP/dt = 100,000 * d(e^(ln(1.02)*t))/dt\n\nTo differentiate the exponential function, we have:\n\nd(e^(ln(1.02)*t))/dt = e^(ln(1.02)*t) * d(ln(1.02)*t)/dt\n\nNow we need to differentiate ln(1.02)*t with respect to t:\n\nd(ln(1.02)*t)/dt = ln(1.02)\n\nSo, the derivative of P(t) with respect to t is:\n\ndP/dt = 100,000 * e^(ln(1.02)*t) * ln(1.02)\n\nNow we need to evaluate this derivative at t = 5:\n\ndP/dt(5) = 100,000 * e^(ln(1.02)*5) * ln(1.02)\ndP/dt(5) = 100,000 * (1.02)^5 * ln(1.02)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\ndP/dt(5) ≈ 10,408.16\n\nSo, the rate of growth in the population after 5 years is approximately 10,408 people per year."
