    "message_1": "In a statistics class, the instructor gives a final exam, which has a normal distribution with a mean score of 80 and a standard deviation of 10. If John's z-score on the exam is 1.5, what is his actual score on the exam?",
    "message_2": "To find John's actual score on the exam, we can use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere z is the z-score, X is the actual score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. We are given z = 1.5, μ = 80, and σ = 10. We need to solve for X.\n\n1.5 = (X - 80) / 10\n\nNow, we can isolate X by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:\n\n1.5 * 10 = (X - 80)\n\n15 = X - 80\n\nNow, add 80 to both sides of the equation to find X:\n\nX = 15 + 80\n\nX = 95\n\nJohn's actual score on the exam is 95."
