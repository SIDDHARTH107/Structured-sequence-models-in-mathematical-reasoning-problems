Find the partial derivatives $u_x$, $u_y$, $v_x$, and $v_y$ for $f(z)$, where $u(x,y) = \\operatorname{Re}(f(z))$ and $v(x,y) = \\operatorname{Im}(f(z))$. Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to determine if $f(z)$ is analytic at any point.",
    "message_2": "To find the partial derivatives, we first need to express the complex function $f(z) = e^z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. We can do this by writing $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = e^{x+iy} = e^x e^{iy} = e^x (\\cos y + i \\sin y).$$\n\nNow, we can identify the real and imaginary parts of the function:\n\n$$u(x,y) = \\operatorname{Re}(f(z)) = e^x \\cos y$$\n$$v(x,y) = \\operatorname{Im}(f(z)) = e^x \\sin y$$\n\nNext, we find the partial derivatives of $u$ and $v$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = e^x \\cos y$$\n$$u_y = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -e^x \\sin y$$\n$$v_x = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = e^x \\sin y$$\n$$v_y = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = e^x \\cos y$$\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to determine if $f(z)$ is analytic at any point. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are:\n\n$$u_x = v_y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u_y = -v_x$$\n\nComparing the partial derivatives we found earlier, we see that:\n\n$$u_x = e^x \\cos y = v_y$$\n$$u_y = -e^x \\sin y = -v_x$$\n\nSince both Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied for all values of $x$ and $y$, the function $f(z) = e^z$ is analytic at every point in the complex plane."
