    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a burglary occurring in a certain neighborhood is 0.05 in a given month. If there are 500 homes in the neighborhood, how many burglaries are we likely to see in a month?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of burglaries in a month, we can multiply the probability of a burglary occurring by the total number of homes in the neighborhood.\n\nExpected number of burglaries = Probability of a burglary * Total number of homes\nExpected number of burglaries = 0.05 * 500\nExpected number of burglaries = 25\n\nSo, we can expect to see approximately 25 burglaries in the neighborhood in a given month."
