    "message_2": "To find the probability of a hurricane occurring in a region, we can use the historical data provided. \n\nAn average of 2 hurricanes occur every 5 years. Therefore, the probability of a hurricane occurring in a given year can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability of a hurricane occurring in a year = (Number of hurricanes) / (Number of years)\n\nProbability = 2 hurricanes / 5 years\n\nProbability = 0.4 or 40%\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane occurring in the region in a given year is 40%."
