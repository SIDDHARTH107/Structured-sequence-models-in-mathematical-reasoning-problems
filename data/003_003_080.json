    "message_2": "To find the sine of 60 degrees using the unit circle, we first need to convert the degrees to radians. \n\n60 degrees * (π / 180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, we can find the sine value using the unit circle. The coordinates of a point on the unit circle are (cos(θ), sin(θ)), where θ is the angle in radians.\n\nFor an angle of π/3 radians (60 degrees), the coordinates on the unit circle are:\n\n(cos(π/3), sin(π/3)) = (1/2, √3/2)\n\nSo, the sine of 60 degrees (π/3 radians) is:\n\nsin(60°) = sin(π/3) = √3/2"
