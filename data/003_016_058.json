    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sine function is the horizontal shift of the function from its standard position. In the given equation, y = 3sin(2x - π/4), the phase shift can be found by looking at the term inside the sine function, which is (2x - π/4).\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to determine the value of x that makes the term inside the sine function equal to zero:\n\n2x - π/4 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = π/4\nx = π/8\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function is π/8 units to the right."
