    "message_1": "Consider two algebraic curves in the plane given by the equations:\n\nC1: x^2 - y^2 = 1 \n\nC2: x + y = 2 \n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, find the number of intersection points of these two curves.",
    "message_2": "To apply Bezout's theorem, we first need to find the degrees of the two curves. The degree of a curve is the highest degree of its defining polynomial.\n\nFor C1: x^2 - y^2 = 1, the highest degree is 2 (from the x^2 and y^2 terms). So, the degree of C1 is 2.\n\nFor C2: x + y = 2, the highest degree is 1 (from the x and y terms). So, the degree of C2 is 1.\n\nNow, we can apply Bezout's theorem, which states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are finite and distinct.\n\nIn this case, the number of intersection points is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nSo, the two curves C1 and C2 have 2 intersection points."
