    "message_2": "To find the number of different committees that can be formed, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (10 in this case), k is the number of people to be selected (4 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different committees that can be formed from a group of 10 people."
