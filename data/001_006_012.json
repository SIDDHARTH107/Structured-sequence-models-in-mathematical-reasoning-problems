    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x - 21, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = x^2 + 4x - 21\n\nNow we can try to factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula. Let's use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 4, and c = -21. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(1)(-21))) / 2(1)\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 84)) / 2\nx = (-4 ± √100) / 2\nx = (-4 ± 10) / 2\n\nNow we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (-4 + 10) / 2\nx = 6 / 2\nx = 3\n\nand\n\nx = (-4 - 10) / 2\nx = -14 / 2\nx = -7\n\nSo the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x - 21 are x = 3 and x = -7."
