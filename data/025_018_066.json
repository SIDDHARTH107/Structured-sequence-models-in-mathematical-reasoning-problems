    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of X and L, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the equation of the conic X and the equation of the line L:\n\n1) x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0\n2) x + y - 2z = 0\n\nFirst, we can solve equation (2) for y:\n\ny = 2z - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in equation (1):\n\nx^2 + (2z - x)^2 - z^2 = 0\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\nx^2 + 4z^2 - 4xz + x^2 - z^2 = 0\n2x^2 - 4xz + 3z^2 = 0\n\nNow, factor out the common factor of 2:\n\nx^2 - 2xz + (3/2)z^2 = 0\n\nLet's complete the square for x:\n\n(x - z)^2 + (1/2)z^2 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in terms of x and z. Since we are working in the projective plane, we can set z = 1 (since we can always scale the homogeneous coordinates). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n(x - 1)^2 + (1/2) = 0\n\nThis equation has no real solutions for x, which means that the intersection points are complex. Let's find the complex solutions for x:\n\nx = 1 ± i√(1/2)\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding values for y using the expression y = 2z - x:\n\ny = 2(1) - (1 ± i√(1/2))\ny = 1 ∓ i√(1/2)\n\nSo, the intersection points of X and L are:\n\nP1 = [1 + i√(1/2) : 1 - i√(1/2) : 1]\nP2 = [1 - i√(1/2) : 1 + i√(1/2) : 1]\n\nSince these points are distinct and not real, the intersection is a simple one."
