    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices and minimum degree δ has girth at least:\n\ng ≥ 1 + log_δ(n)\n\nIn our case, we have 10 vertices and 18 edges. The average degree of the graph is:\n\n(2 * 18) / 10 = 3.6\n\nSince the average degree is 3.6, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher (δ ≥ 4). Now, we can use the inequality above to find the lower bound for the girth:\n\ng ≥ 1 + log_4(10)\ng ≥ 1 + 1.660964\ng ≥ 2.660964\n\nSince the girth must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer:\n\ng ≥ 3\n\nThus, the girth of the graph is at least 3. However, we need to check if a cycle of length 3 is possible in this graph. A cycle of length 3 requires that there is a vertex connected to two other vertices, which are also connected to each other. Since we have a vertex with a degree of 4 or higher, it is possible to have a cycle of length 3.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph is 3."
