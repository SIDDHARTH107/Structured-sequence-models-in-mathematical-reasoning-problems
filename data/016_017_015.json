    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the curve doubles, and the length of each segment remains the same.\n\nAfter 10 iterations, the number of segments in the curve will be 2^10 = 1024. Since the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations will be 1024 * 1 = 1024 units.\n\nThe perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve is the same as its total length since it is a continuous curve without any closed loops. Therefore, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is also 1024 units."
