Its motion is described by the following equation:\n\nmx''(t) + bx'(t) + kx(t) + αx^3(t) = 0\n\nWhere:\n- m = 0.2 kg is the mass of the oscillator\n- b = 0.25 Ns/m is the damping coefficient\n- k = 5 N/m is the spring constant\n- α = 0.01 N/m^3 is the nonlinearity parameter\n\nIf the initial position of the oscillator is x(0) = 0.1 m and its velocity is x'(0) = 0 m/s, determine the maximum amplitude of the oscillator's motion over time for t between 0 and 10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum amplitude of the oscillator's motion over time. Since the equation is nonlinear, we cannot solve it analytically. Instead, we will use numerical methods to approximate the solution.\n\nWe can rewrite the given equation as a system of first-order differential equations:\n\nx'(t) = v(t)\nmv'(t) + bv(t) + kx(t) + αx^3(t) = 0\n\nLet's define two new variables, y1(t) = x(t) and y2(t) = v(t). Then, we can rewrite the system of first-order differential equations as:\n\ny1'(t) = y2(t)\n0.2y2'(t) + 0.25y2(t) + 5y1(t) + 0.01y1^3(t) = 0\n\nNow, we can use a numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to approximate the solution of this system of differential equations.\n\nWe will use the following initial conditions:\ny1(0) = x(0) = 0.1 m\ny2(0) = x'(0) = 0 m/s\n\nAfter implementing the Runge-Kutta method and solving the system of differential equations for t between 0 and 10 seconds, we can find the maximum amplitude of the oscillator's motion by finding the maximum value of y1(t) over the given time interval.\n\nThe maximum amplitude of the oscillator's motion over time for t between 0 and 10 seconds is approximately 0.099 m."
