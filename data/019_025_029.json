If 25 workers are currently working in the factory, how many workers should the factory management hire to produce 700 units of the product per day according to the causal logic?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find out the increase in production per worker according to the factory management's belief. They think that increasing the number of workers by 20 will increase the production by 150 units per day.\n\nIncrease in production = 150 units\nIncrease in workers = 20\n\nSo, the increase in production per worker is:\n\n150 units / 20 workers = 7.5 units/worker\n\nNow, the factory wants to produce 700 units per day. Currently, they are producing 500 units per day. So, they need an increase in production of:\n\n700 units - 500 units = 200 units\n\nTo find out how many workers are needed to increase the production by 200 units, we can use the increase in production per worker:\n\n200 units / 7.5 units/worker = 26.67 workers\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a worker, we will round up to the nearest whole number:\n\n27 workers\n\nSo, the factory management should hire 27 workers to produce 700 units of the product per day according to the causal logic."
