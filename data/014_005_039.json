    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and she wants to use digital signatures to ensure that the message cannot be tampered with. Alice's private key has a modulus of 253 and her public key has a modulus of 256. She chooses a random number k = 19 and computes the message digest hash(m) = 127. What is the value of the digital signature that Alice should send to Bob to ensure that the message has not been tampered with?",
    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature, Alice needs to raise the message digest hash(m) to the power of her private key modulus and then take the result modulo her public key modulus.\n\nIn this case, the message digest hash(m) is 127, the private key modulus is 253, and the public key modulus is 256.\n\nSo, the digital signature (s) can be calculated as follows:\n\ns = (hash(m) ^ private_key_modulus) % public_key_modulus\ns = (127 ^ 253) % 256\n\nUsing a calculator or a programming language that supports large number calculations, we find:\n\ns = 239\n\nSo, the value of the digital signature that Alice should send to Bob to ensure that the message has not been tampered with is 239."
