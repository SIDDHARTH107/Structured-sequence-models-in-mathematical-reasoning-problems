    "message_2": "To find the order of the zero of the function f(z) = sin(z)/(z^2 + 1)^3 at z = i, we first need to determine if f(z) has a zero at z = i.\n\nLet's plug z = i into the function:\n\nf(i) = sin(i)/((i^2 + 1)^3)\n\nRecall that sin(i) = (e^(i*i) - e^(-i*i))/(2i) = (e^(-1) - e)/2i. Now, let's plug this into the function:\n\nf(i) = ((e^(-1) - e)/2i)/((i^2 + 1)^3)\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we have:\n\nf(i) = ((e^(-1) - e)/2i)/((-1 + 1)^3) = ((e^(-1) - e)/2i)/(0^3)\n\nThe denominator is 0, which means f(i) is undefined. However, we can apply L'Hopital's rule to find the limit as z approaches i:\n\nlim (z->i) f(z) = lim (z->i) sin(z)/(z^2 + 1)^3\n\nWe need to find the derivative of the numerator and denominator with respect to z:\n\nd(sin(z))/dz = cos(z)\nd((z^2 + 1)^3)/dz = 3(z^2 + 1)^2 * 2z = 6z(z^2 + 1)^2\n\nNow, let's apply L'Hopital's rule:\n\nlim (z->i) f(z) = lim (z->i) cos(z) / 6z(z^2 + 1)^2\n\nPlugging in z = i:\n\nlim (z->i) f(z) = cos(i) / 6i(i^2 + 1)^2\n\nRecall that cos(i) = (e^(i*i) + e^(-i*i))/2 = (e^(-1) + e)/2. Now, let's plug this into the limit:\n\nlim (z->i) f(z) = ((e^(-1) + e)/2) / 6i(-1 + 1)^2 = ((e^(-1) + e)/2) / 6i(0)^2\n\nThe limit is nonzero, which means that f(z) has a zero at z = i. Since we only applied L'Hopital's rule once, the order of the zero is 1."
