    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n3^(x+1) = 9\n\nSince 9 is the same as 3^2, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3^(x+1) = 3^2\n\nNow, since the bases are the same (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 1 = 2\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 1 from both sides:\n\nx = 2 - 1\n\nx = 1"
