    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In this case, we are looking for isometries that fix the point $(1,0,0)$. Let $T$ be an isometry of the metric $g_{ij} = \\operatorname{diag}(1,9,9)$, and let $T(x) = Ax + b$ be an affine transformation, where $A$ is a linear transformation and $b$ is a translation vector.\n\nSince $T$ fixes the point $(1,0,0)$, we have $T(1,0,0) = (1,0,0)$. Thus, $A(1,0,0) + b = (1,0,0)$, which implies that $b = (0,0,0)$. Therefore, $T$ is a linear transformation, i.e., $T(x) = Ax$.\n\nNow, we need to find the matrix $A$ that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. Let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The distance between $x$ and $y$ in the metric $g_{ij}$ is given by:\n\n$$d(x,y) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + 9(x_2 - y_2)^2 + 9(x_3 - y_3)^2}$$\n\nSince $T$ is an isometry, we have $d(x,y) = d(T(x), T(y))$. Thus,\n\n$$\\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + 9(x_2 - y_2)^2 + 9(x_3 - y_3)^2} = \\sqrt{(A_{11}(x_1 - y_1) + A_{12}(x_2 - y_2) + A_{13}(x_3 - y_3))^2 + 9(A_{21}(x_1 - y_1) + A_{22}(x_2 - y_2) + A_{23}(x_3 - y_3))^2 + 9(A_{31}(x_1 - y_1) + A_{32}(x_2 - y_2) + A_{33}(x_3 - y_3))^2}$$\n\nSquaring both sides and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$(x_1 - y_1)^2 + 9(x_2 - y_2)^2 + 9(x_3 - y_3)^2 = (A_{11}(x_1 - y_1) + A_{12}(x_2 - y_2) + A_{13}(x_3 - y_3))^2 + 9(A_{21}(x_1 - y_1) + A_{22}(x_2 - y_2) + A_{23}(x_3 - y_3))^2 + 9(A_{31}(x_1 - y_1) + A_{32}(x_2 - y_2) + A_{33}(x_3 - y_3))^2$$\n\nThis equation must hold for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Comparing the coefficients, we get the following conditions on the matrix $A$:\n\n1. $A_{11}^2 + A_{12}^2 + A_{13}^2 = 1$\n2. $A_{21}^2 + A_{22}^2 + A_{23}^2 = 1$\n3. $A_{31}^2 + A_{32}^2 + A_{33}^2 = 1$\n4. $A_{11}A_{21} + A_{12}A_{22} + A_{13}A_{23} = 0$\n5. $A_{11}A_{31} + A_{12}A_{32} + A_{13}A_{33} = 0$\n6. $A_{21}A_{31} + A_{22}A_{32} + A_{23}A_{33} = 0$\n\nThese conditions imply that the columns of the matrix $A$ are orthonormal. Since $A$ is a real matrix, it is an orthogonal matrix. Moreover, since $T$ is an isometry, the determinant of $A$ must be either $1$ or $-1$. However, since $T$ fixes the point $(1,0,0)$, we have $A(1,0,0) = (1,0,0)$, which implies that the first column of $A$ is $(1,0,0)$. Thus, the determinant of $A$ is $1$, and $A$ is a rotation matrix.\n\nIn summary, all isometries of the metric $g_{ij} = \\operatorname{diag}(1,9,9)$ that fix the point $(1,0,0)$ are given by the linear transformations $T(x) = Ax$, where $A$ is a rotation matrix with the first column being $(1,0,0)$."
