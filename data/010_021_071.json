    "message_1": "Consider a symplectic manifold M of dimension 4 with a symplectic form $\\omega$. Suppose that there exists a Hamiltonian function $H \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$ with only two critical points, both of which are non-degenerate. If one of the critical points of H has $H(p)=2$ and the other has $H(q)=8$, find the number of closed orbits of the Hamiltonian vector field XH intersecting a given 2-sphere of radius 1 in M centered at a regular point.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the Hamiltonian vector field by $X_H$. Since $H$ has only two non-degenerate critical points, by the Morse theory, the Morse index of $p$ and $q$ must be different. Without loss of generality, let's assume that the Morse index of $p$ is 1 and the Morse index of $q$ is 3. \n\nNow, consider the energy level sets $H^{-1}(c)$ for $c \\in [2, 8]$. Since the critical points are non-degenerate, the level sets are regular for all $c \\in (2, 8)$. Moreover, since the Morse indices are different, the topology of the level sets changes only at the critical points. Thus, the level sets are diffeomorphic to each other for $c \\in (2, 8)$.\n\nLet $S$ be the given 2-sphere of radius 1 in $M$ centered at a regular point. Since $S$ is compact, there exists a constant $c_0 \\in (2, 8)$ such that $S$ is contained in the level set $H^{-1}(c_0)$. By the above discussion, $H^{-1}(c_0)$ is diffeomorphic to all other regular level sets. \n\nNow, let's consider the flow of $X_H$. Since $X_H$ is tangent to the level sets, the flow preserves the level sets. Therefore, the closed orbits of $X_H$ intersecting $S$ are also closed orbits of $X_H$ intersecting $H^{-1}(c_0)$. \n\nTo find the number of closed orbits, we can use the Poincar√©-Birkhoff theorem. Since the Morse index of $p$ is 1, there is one closed orbit of $X_H$ intersecting $H^{-1}(c_0)$ near $p$. Similarly, since the Morse index of $q$ is 3, there are three closed orbits of $X_H$ intersecting $H^{-1}(c_0)$ near $q$. However, one of these orbits is homotopic to the other two, so it does not contribute to the count of distinct closed orbits.\n\nThus, there are 1 (from $p$) + 2 (from $q$) = 3 distinct closed orbits of $X_H$ intersecting the given 2-sphere $S$."
