    "message_1": "A company wants to distribute its resources optimally to maximize profit. The company has a budget of $10,000, and two products that they can produce: Product A and Product B. The production cost of Product A is $1000 per unit, and the production cost of Product B is $1500 per unit. Product A generates a profit of $3000 per unit sold, and Product B generates a profit of $4000 per unit sold. Due to market demand, the company can produce a maximum of 8 units of Product A and 6 units of Product B. What is the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B the company should produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. Production cost constraint: 1000x + 1500y ≤ 10,000 (the total cost of producing x units of Product A and y units of Product B should not exceed the budget of $10,000)\n2. Market demand constraint for Product A: x ≤ 8\n3. Market demand constraint for Product B: y ≤ 6\n4. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit: P = 3000x + 4000y\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then determine the optimal solution by evaluating the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\n1. 1000x + 1500y ≤ 10,000\n   Divide by 500: 2x + 3y ≤ 20\n\n2. x ≤ 8\n3. y ≤ 6\n4. x ≥ 0\n5. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0,0), (0,6), (4,4), (8,0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 3000x + 4000y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 3000(0) + 4000(0) = 0\n2. P(0,6) = 3000(0) + 4000(6) = 24,000\n3. P(4,4) = 3000(4) + 4000(4) = 28,000\n4. P(8,0) = 3000(8) + 4000(0) = 24,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (4,4), where the company produces 4 units of Product A and 4 units of Product B, resulting in a total profit of $28,000."
