    "message_1": "A radioactive substance has a half-life of 10 days. If the initial amount of the substance is 200 grams, how much will remain after 30 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 200 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, 25 grams of the radioactive substance will remain."
