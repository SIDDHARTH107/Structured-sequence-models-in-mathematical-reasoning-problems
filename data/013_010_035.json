    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, that are competing in a Cournot market with demand given by P(Q) = 96 - 4Q, where Q = qA + qB. Both firms have the same constant marginal cost of $10 per unit. Firm A currently produces 20 units of output. How much output should firm B produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing output for firm B, we first need to find the reaction function for firm B. The reaction function shows the optimal output for a firm given the output of its competitor.\n\nLet qA be the output of firm A and qB be the output of firm B. The total output in the market is Q = qA + qB. The demand function is given by P(Q) = 96 - 4Q. The marginal cost for both firms is $10 per unit.\n\nFirst, we need to find the revenue for firm B, which is given by the product of price and quantity: R_B = P(Q) * qB.\n\nSubstitute the demand function into the revenue function:\n\nR_B = (96 - 4Q) * qB\n\nNow, substitute Q = qA + qB into the revenue function:\n\nR_B = (96 - 4(qA + qB)) * qB\n\nNext, we need to find the cost function for firm B, which is given by the product of marginal cost and quantity: C_B = 10 * qB.\n\nNow, we can find the profit function for firm B, which is the difference between revenue and cost: π_B = R_B - C_B.\n\nSubstitute the revenue and cost functions into the profit function:\n\nπ_B = (96 - 4(qA + qB)) * qB - 10 * qB\n\nNow, to find the profit-maximizing output for firm B, we need to take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to qB and set it equal to zero:\n\ndπ_B/dqB = 0\n\nTake the derivative:\n\ndπ_B/dqB = -4qA - 8qB + 86\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for qB:\n\n-4qA - 8qB + 86 = 0\n\nGiven that firm A produces 20 units, we can substitute qA = 20 into the equation:\n\n-4(20) - 8qB + 86 = 0\n\nSolve for qB:\n\n-80 - 8qB + 86 = 0\n-8qB = -6\nqB = 6/8 = 3/4\n\nSo, to maximize its profit, firm B should produce 3/4 units of output. However, since output must be a whole number, firm B should produce either 0 or 1 unit of output to maximize its profit."
