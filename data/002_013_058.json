    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base that measures 8 cm by 12 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nThe base of the pyramid is a rectangle with dimensions 8 cm by 12 cm, so its area is:\n\nbase_area = 8 cm * 12 cm = 96 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 96 cm² * 10 cm = 32 cm² * 10 cm = 320 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 320 cm³."
