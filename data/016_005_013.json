    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/R)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and R is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set, the initial segment is divided into 3 equal parts, and the middle third is removed, leaving 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2). The scaling factor is the ratio of the length of each remaining segment to the original segment, which is 1/3 (R = 1/3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Cantor set is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(1/3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is approximately 0.6309."
