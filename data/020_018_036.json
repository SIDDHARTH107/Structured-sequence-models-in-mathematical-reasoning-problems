The company estimates that for every player in the game, they will need 0.2 Mbps (megabits per second) of bandwidth to ensure smooth gameplay. The company is working with an internet service provider that charges $0.005 per Mbps per hour. What is the cost per hour of providing enough bandwidth for a maximum of 10,000 players for the game?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the total bandwidth required for 10,000 players. \n\nBandwidth per player = 0.2 Mbps\nTotal players = 10,000\n\nTotal bandwidth required = Bandwidth per player * Total players\nTotal bandwidth required = 0.2 Mbps * 10,000\nTotal bandwidth required = 2,000 Mbps\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost per hour for providing this bandwidth.\n\nCost per Mbps per hour = $0.005\n\nTotal cost per hour = Total bandwidth required * Cost per Mbps per hour\nTotal cost per hour = 2,000 Mbps * $0.005\nTotal cost per hour = $10,000"
