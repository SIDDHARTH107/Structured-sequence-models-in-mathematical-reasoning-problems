    "message_2": "To find the maximum magnitude value of the Fourier coefficients, we first need to understand the 2D Fourier transform and its properties. The 2D Fourier transform of a grayscale image f(x, y) is given by:\n\nF(u, v) = ∫∫ f(x, y) * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx dy\n\nwhere F(u, v) are the Fourier coefficients, and u and v are the frequency variables. The magnitude of the Fourier coefficients is given by:\n\n|F(u, v)| = sqrt(Re(F(u, v))^2 + Im(F(u, v))^2)\n\nwhere Re(F(u, v)) and Im(F(u, v)) are the real and imaginary parts of F(u, v), respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of the 2D Fourier transform. The maximum magnitude value of the Fourier coefficients occurs at the lowest frequencies (u = 0 and v = 0), which corresponds to the DC component of the image. This component represents the average intensity of the image.\n\nTo find the maximum magnitude value, we need to calculate the DC component:\n\nF(0, 0) = ∫∫ f(x, y) dx dy\n\nSince the image size is 256x256 pixels, the maximum intensity value for each pixel in a grayscale image is 255. Therefore, the maximum average intensity of the image occurs when all pixels have the maximum intensity value:\n\nF(0, 0) = ∫∫ 255 dx dy = 255 * 256 * 256\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnitude of the maximum Fourier coefficient:\n\n|F(0, 0)| = sqrt(Re(F(0, 0))^2 + Im(F(0, 0))^2) = sqrt((255 * 256 * 256)^2 + 0^2) = 255 * 256 * 256\n\nSo, the maximum magnitude value of the Fourier coefficients for a 256x256 grayscale image is 255 * 256 * 256."
