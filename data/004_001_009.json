    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x - 7, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = (4 * 3x^(4-1)) - (3 * 2x^(3-1)) + 5 - 0\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 12(2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 5\nf'(2) = 12(8) - 6(4) + 5\nf'(2) = 96 - 24 + 5\nf'(2) = 77\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x - 7 at x = 2 is 77."
