    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the network, we will first find the Fourier transform of the input and output signals.\n\nThe input signal v(t) = 3sin(2π(50)t) can be represented as:\nv(t) = 3sin(ωt), where ω = 2π(50)\n\nThe Fourier transform of v(t) is given by:\nV(ω) = (3/2)j[δ(ω - 2π(50)) - δ(ω + 2π(50))]\n\nThe output signal y(t) = 7sin(2π(50)t - π/3) can be represented as:\ny(t) = 7sin(ωt - φ), where ω = 2π(50) and φ = π/3\n\nThe Fourier transform of y(t) is given by:\nY(ω) = (7/2)j[δ(ω - 2π(50))e^(-jφ) - δ(ω + 2π(50))e^(jφ)]\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) by dividing the output Fourier transform by the input Fourier transform:\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / V(ω)\n\nH(ω) = [(7/2)j[δ(ω - 2π(50))e^(-jφ) - δ(ω + 2π(50))e^(jφ)]] / [(3/2)j[δ(ω - 2π(50)) - δ(ω + 2π(50))]]\n\nBy canceling out the common terms and simplifying, we get:\n\nH(ω) = (7/3)e^(-jφ)\n\nThe amplitude of the transfer function is the magnitude of H(ω):\n\nAmplitude = |H(ω)| = 7/3\n\nThe phase shift of the transfer function is the argument of H(ω):\n\nPhase shift = -φ = -π/3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the network's transfer function is 7/3, and the phase shift is -π/3."
