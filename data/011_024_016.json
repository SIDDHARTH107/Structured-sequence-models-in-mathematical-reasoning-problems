The table below lists the roads, their capacities, and the transportation cost per unit:\n\n| Road  | Capacity | Cost per Unit |\n|-------|----------|---------------|\n|   A   |  1500    |     $5        |\n|   B   |  2000    |     $6        |\n|   C   |  1000    |     $7        |\n|   D   |  2500    |     $4        |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost to transport all 5000 units of the product from the warehouse to the cities using the given road network?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the transportation cost, we should prioritize using the roads with the lowest cost per unit. In this case, the roads should be used in the following order: D, A, B, and C.\n\n1. Use Road D to transport 2500 units at $4 per unit:\n   2500 units * $4 = $10,000\n\n2. Use Road A to transport 1500 units at $5 per unit:\n   1500 units * $5 = $7,500\n\nAt this point, we have transported 4000 units (2500 + 1500) and still need to transport 1000 more units.\n\n3. Use Road B to transport the remaining 1000 units at $6 per unit:\n   1000 units * $6 = $6,000\n\nThe total cost for transporting all 5000 units is:\n\n   $10,000 (Road D) + $7,500 (Road A) + $6,000 (Road B) = $23,500\n\nSo, the minimum cost to transport all 5000 units of the product from the warehouse to the cities using the given road network is $23,500."
