    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The distance between the wall and the ladder's base on the ground is 8 feet, and the ladder makes a 60-degree angle with the ground. How long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side (the distance between the wall and the ladder's base) to the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder).\n\ncos(60°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(60°) = 8 feet / length of the ladder\n\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5, so we have:\n\n0.5 = 8 feet / length of the ladder\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of the ladder:\n\nlength of the ladder = 8 feet / 0.5\nlength of the ladder = 16 feet\n\nThe ladder is 16 feet long."
