    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of a cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe formula for the area of a square is side length × side length. In this case, the side length is 5 cm.\n\nArea of one face = 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube.\n\nSurface area of the cube = 6 × 25 square centimeters = 150 square centimeters."
