    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose a committee of 4 people from a group of 8 people, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (8 in this case), k is the number of people to be chosen (4 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo, there are 70 ways to choose a committee of 4 people from a group of 8 people."
