    "message_1": "A math student needs to make a decision on whether to take an advanced calculus course or a statistics course. The payoffs for each decision are as follows: If the student takes the advanced calculus course, he has a 60% chance of getting an A and a 40% chance of getting a B, with a payoff of 4 if he gets an A and 3 if he gets a B. If he takes the statistics course, there is a 70% chance of getting an A and a 30% chance of getting a B, with a payoff of 5 if he gets an A and 2 if he gets a B. Based on these payoffs, which course should the math student take?",
    "message_2": "To determine which course the student should take, we can calculate the expected payoff for each course by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its respective payoff and then summing the results.\n\nFor the advanced calculus course:\nExpected payoff = (0.6 * 4) + (0.4 * 3)\nExpected payoff = 2.4 + 1.2\nExpected payoff = 3.6\n\nFor the statistics course:\nExpected payoff = (0.7 * 5) + (0.3 * 2)\nExpected payoff = 3.5 + 0.6\nExpected payoff = 4.1\n\nSince the expected payoff for the statistics course (4.1) is higher than the expected payoff for the advanced calculus course (3.6), the math student should take the statistics course."
