    "message_2": "To find the degree of the intersection of the two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$, we can use Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the degree of the intersection of two algebraic curves in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$ is equal to the product of the degrees of the curves, unless they share a common component.\n\nFirst, let's find the degrees of the curves $C_1$ and $C_2$. The degree of an algebraic curve is the highest total degree of its defining polynomial. In this case, both $C_1$ and $C_2$ are defined by polynomials of total degree 4. Therefore, the degree of both curves is 4.\n\nNow, we need to check if the curves share a common component. If they do, Bézout's theorem does not apply, and we need to find the intersection degree in a different way. However, in this case, the curves do not share a common component, as their defining polynomials have no common factors.\n\nSince the curves do not share a common component, we can apply Bézout's theorem. The degree of the intersection of $C_1$ and $C_2$ is equal to the product of their degrees:\n\n$d = \\deg(C_1) \\cdot \\deg(C_2) = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16$\n\nTherefore, the degree of the intersection of the two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ is 16."
