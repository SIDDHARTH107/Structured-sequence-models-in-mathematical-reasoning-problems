    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 1, we will integrate each term separately with respect to x.\n\nThe antiderivative of x^n, where n is a constant, is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2, we have:\n\n∫(3x^2) dx = 3∫(x^2) dx = 3(x^(2+1))/(2+1) + C1 = x^3 + C1\n\nFor the second term, 4x, we have:\n\n∫(4x) dx = 4∫(x) dx = 4(x^(1+1))/(1+1) + C2 = 2x^2 + C2\n\nFor the third term, -1, we have:\n\n∫(-1) dx = -∫(1) dx = -x + C3\n\nNow, we add the antiderivatives of each term together:\n\nF(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x + (C1 + C2 + C3)\n\nSince C1, C2, and C3 are constants, we can combine them into a single constant, C:\n\nF(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 1 is F(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x + C."
