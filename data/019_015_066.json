    "message_2": "In type theory, the type of a function is determined by the types of its input and output. Assuming that the function f(x) = x + 2 takes an integer as input and returns an integer as output, the type of the function f would be:\n\nf : Integer -> Integer\n\nHere, the arrow (->) denotes that the function f takes an Integer as input and returns an Integer as output."
