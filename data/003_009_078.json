    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 8 cm and 10 cm. The included angle between those two sides is 120 degrees. What is the perimeter of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, a = 8 cm, b = 10 cm, and C = 120 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (120 * π) / 180 = (2 * π) / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos((2 * π) / 3)\nc² = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos((2 * π) / 3)\nc² = 164 - 160 * (-1/2)\nc² = 164 + 80\nc² = 244\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √244 ≈ 15.62 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the third side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 8 + 10 + 15.62\nPerimeter ≈ 33.62 cm"
