    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism to the nearest tenth?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (d) is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h):\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nl = 8 cm\nw = 5 cm\nh = 4 cm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nd = √((8 cm)² + (5 cm)² + (4 cm)²)\nd = √(64 cm² + 25 cm² + 16 cm²)\nd = √(105 cm²)\n\nThe exact value of the diagonal is √(105) cm. To find the length of the diagonal to the nearest tenth, we can approximate the square root:\n\nd ≈ 10.2 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 10.2 cm."
