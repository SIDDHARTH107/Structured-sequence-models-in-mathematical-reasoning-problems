    "message_2": "Let the length of the other leg be x cm. Since it is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is 10 cm and one leg is 6 cm.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + x^2\n100 = 36 + x^2\n100 - 36 = x^2\n64 = x^2\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nâˆš64 = x\n8 = x\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
