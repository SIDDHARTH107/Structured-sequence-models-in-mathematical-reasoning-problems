    "message_1": "A furniture factory receives orders for two types of chairs, chair A and chair B. Chair A requires 4 hours of carpentry work and 3 hours of painting work, while chair B requires 2 hours of carpentry work and 5 hours of painting work. The factory has 100 hours of carpentry work and 80 hours of painting work available per week. Chair A sells for $50 and requires $10 worth of materials, while chair B sells for $70 and requires $15 worth of materials. How many chairs of each type should the factory produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chair A produced and y be the number of chair B produced.\n\nThe profit for chair A is $50 - $10 = $40 per chair, and the profit for chair B is $70 - $15 = $55 per chair. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 40x + 55y.\n\nThe constraints for the available hours of carpentry and painting work are:\n\n4x + 2y ≤ 100 (carpentry constraint)\n3x + 5y ≤ 80 (painting constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow we need to find the feasible region defined by these constraints and find the maximum profit point.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the carpentry constraint for y:\n\n2y ≤ 100 - 4x\ny ≤ 50 - 2x\n\nNext, we'll solve the painting constraint for y:\n\n5y ≤ 80 - 3x\ny ≤ 16 - 0.6x\n\nNow we'll find the intersection points of these constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of carpentry constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n0 ≤ 50 - 2x\nx ≤ 25\n\n2. Intersection of painting constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n0 ≤ 16 - 0.6x\nx ≤ 26.67 (approximately)\n\n3. Intersection of carpentry constraint and painting constraint:\n50 - 2x = 16 - 0.6x\n34 = 1.4x\nx ≈ 24.29\n\ny = 50 - 2(24.29) ≈ 1.42\n\nNow we'll check the profit at each of these intersection points:\n\n1. P(25, 0) = 40(25) + 55(0) = $1000\n2. P(26.67, 0) is not valid since it exceeds the carpentry constraint.\n3. P(24.29, 1.42) ≈ 40(24.29) + 55(1.42) ≈ $1000.58\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the factory produces approximately 24 chair A and 1 chair B, with a profit of approximately $1000.58. However, since the factory can only produce whole chairs, they should produce 24 chair A and 1 chair B to maximize their profit at $1000."
