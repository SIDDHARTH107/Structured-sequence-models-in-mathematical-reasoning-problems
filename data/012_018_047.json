    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges that, when removed, will result in the graph being split into two or more disconnected components.\n\nTo find the edge connectivity of a graph G with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we can use the following formula:\n\nEdge connectivity (Î») = min{degree(v) for all vertices v in G}\n\nSince G has 6 vertices and 9 edges, the average degree of the vertices in G is (2 * 9) / 6 = 3. Therefore, the minimum degree of any vertex in G must be less than or equal to 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario where there is a vertex with degree 3, and all other vertices have a higher degree. In this case, removing the 3 edges connected to the vertex with degree 3 will disconnect the graph.\n\nSo, the edge connectivity of the graph G with 6 vertices and 9 edges is at most 3.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact edge connectivity. It could be less than 3 if there is a vertex with a degree of 1 or 2, which would result in a disconnected graph after removing fewer edges."
