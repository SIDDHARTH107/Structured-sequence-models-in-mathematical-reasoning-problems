    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a self-similar fractal, which means it can be broken down into smaller copies of itself. To find the fractal dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, each iteration consists of 3 smaller copies of itself (N = 3), and each smaller copy is half the size of the original (S = 2).\n\nSo, the fractal dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nThe fractal dimension remains the same after each iteration, so the fractal dimension after the fourth iteration is still approximately 1.5849625."
