    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to find the solutions for x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 1  2  1 | 0\n| 2  4  2 | 0\n| 3  6  3 | 0\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n| 1  2  1 | 0\n| 0  0  0 | 0\n| 0  0  0 | 0\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. We can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the second and third equations do not provide any new information. We are left with only one non-trivial equation:\n\nx + 2y + z = 0\n\nSince this is a homogeneous system, we can express the solutions in terms of a free variable. Let's choose z as the free variable, and express x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = -2y - z\ny = y\nz = z\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a vector:\n\n(x, y, z) = (-2y - z, y, z)\n\nWe can also express this as a linear combination of two vectors:\n\n(x, y, z) = y(-2, 1, 0) + z(-1, 0, 1)\n\nSo, the solution set for this homogeneous system of linear equations is a 2-dimensional subspace in R^3, spanned by the vectors (-2, 1, 0) and (-1, 0, 1)."
