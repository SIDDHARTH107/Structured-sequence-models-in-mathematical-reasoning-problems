    "message_2": "To find a birational map from the given algebraic curve C to a curve C' such that C' is isomorphic to a rational nodal curve, we first need to understand the properties of the curve C and the properties of rational nodal curves.\n\nA rational nodal curve is a curve that is topologically equivalent to a circle with a single node (self-intersection point). It is also a rational curve, meaning that it can be parameterized by rational functions.\n\nLet's assume that the given algebraic curve C has an equation F(x, y, z) = 0 in the projective space P^2. To find a birational map from C to C', we need to find rational functions X(u, v), Y(u, v), and Z(u, v) such that F(X(u, v), Y(u, v), Z(u, v)) = 0 and the curve C' defined by these rational functions is a rational nodal curve.\n\nOne way to construct a rational nodal curve is to consider the curve defined by the equation X^2Y - Z^2(X + Y) = 0 in P^2. This curve has a node at the point [0:0:1] and is a rational curve since it can be parameterized by the rational functions X(u, v) = u^2, Y(u, v) = uv, and Z(u, v) = v^2.\n\nNow, we need to find a birational map between the curve C and this rational nodal curve. To do this, we can try to find a transformation of the form:\n\nX(u, v) = A(u, v) * x + B(u, v) * y + C(u, v) * z\nY(u, v) = D(u, v) * x + E(u, v) * y + F(u, v) * z\nZ(u, v) = G(u, v) * x + H(u, v) * y + I(u, v) * z\n\nwhere A(u, v), B(u, v), ..., I(u, v) are rational functions in u and v, such that F(X(u, v), Y(u, v), Z(u, v)) = 0 and the curve C' defined by these rational functions is isomorphic to the rational nodal curve X^2Y - Z^2(X + Y) = 0.\n\nFinding such a transformation can be a challenging task and may require a case-by-case analysis depending on the specific equation of the curve C. In general, one can try to use techniques from algebraic geometry, such as blowing up points or using Cremona transformations, to find a birational map between the curves."
