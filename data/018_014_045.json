    "message_2": "First, let's find B^c, the complement of set B. Since we are not given a universal set, we cannot determine the exact elements in B^c. However, we can still represent it symbolically as B^c = {x | x ∉ B}.\n\nNow, let's find A × (B^c):\n\nA × (B^c) = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B^c}\n= {(1, x), (2, x), (3, x) | x ∉ B}\n\nNext, let's find A × B:\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\n= {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A × B, denoted as (A × B)^c:\n\n(A × B)^c = {(a, b) | (a, b) ∉ A × B}\n\nWe can see that A × (B^c) contains ordered pairs with elements from A and elements not in B, while (A × B)^c contains all ordered pairs that are not in A × B. \n\nTo prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement, we need to show that A × (B^c) ≠ (A × B)^c.\n\nLet's assume that there exists an element (a, b) ∈ A × (B^c). This means that a ∈ A and b ∉ B. However, this element (a, b) may or may not be in (A × B)^c, as (A × B)^c contains all ordered pairs that are not in A × B, which could include pairs with elements not in A or B as well.\n\nSimilarly, let's assume that there exists an element (a, b) ∈ (A × B)^c. This means that (a, b) ∉ A × B. However, this element (a, b) may or may not be in A × (B^c), as A × (B^c) contains ordered pairs with elements from A and elements not in B.\n\nSince we cannot guarantee that the elements in A × (B^c) and (A × B)^c are the same, we can conclude that A × (B^c) ≠ (A × B)^c, and therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
