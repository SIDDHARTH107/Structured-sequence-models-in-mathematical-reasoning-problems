    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner. After cutting out the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the resulting open box will be:\n\nLength: 30 - 2x\nWidth: 20 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as the product of its length, width, and height:\n\nV(x) = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we can find the critical points of the volume function by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nV'(x) = d/dx[(30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)x]\n\nFirst, expand the volume function:\n\nV(x) = 4x^3 - 100x^2 + 600x\n\nNow, find the derivative:\n\nV'(x) = 12x^2 - 200x + 600\n\nSet V'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 12x^2 - 200x + 600\n\nDivide by 4 to simplify:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 50x + 150\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n0 = (3x - 30)(x - 5)\n\nThe solutions are x = 10 and x = 5/3. Since x must be less than half of the smallest side (20 cm) to create a box, the valid solution is x = 5/3 cm.\n\nNow, plug this value of x back into the volume function to find the maximum volume:\n\nV(5/3) = (30 - 2(5/3))(20 - 2(5/3))(5/3)\nV(5/3) = (80/3)(50/3)(5/3)\nV(5/3) = 2000/9 cm³\n\nThe maximum volume of the box that can be made using this method is 2000/9 cm³."
