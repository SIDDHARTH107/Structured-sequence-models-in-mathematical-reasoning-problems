    "message_2": "To find the general solution to the given nonlinear differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. \n\nGiven: dy/dx = 2xy^2\n\nSeparate the variables by dividing both sides by y^2 and multiplying both sides by dx:\n\n(dy/y^2) = 2x dx\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫(1/y^2) dy = ∫(2x) dx\n\nUsing the power rule for integration, we have:\n\n-1/y = x^2 + C\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the constant C using the initial condition y(0) = -1:\n\n-1/(-1) = 0^2 + C\n\n1 = C\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\n-1/y = x^2 + 1\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = -1/(x^2 + 1)\n\nThis is the general solution to the given nonlinear differential equation with the initial condition y(0) = -1."
