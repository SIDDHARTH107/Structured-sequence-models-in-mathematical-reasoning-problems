    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the right triangle as follows: the side of length 8 cm is the adjacent side (A), the side opposite the 30° angle is the opposite side (O), and the hypotenuse is the longest side (H).\n\nWe can use the trigonometric function tangent to find the length of the opposite side (O). The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.\n\ntan(30°) = O / A\n\nWe know the length of the adjacent side (A) is 8 cm, and we can find the tangent of 30°:\n\ntan(30°) = 1 / √3 ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can solve for the opposite side (O):\n\n0.577 = O / 8\nO ≈ 8 * 0.577\nO ≈ 4.62 cm\n\nNext, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (H):\n\nA² + O² = H²\n8² + 4.62² = H²\n64 + 21.3444 = H²\n85.3444 = H²\nH = √85.3444\nH ≈ 9.24 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all three sides, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = A + O + H\nPerimeter ≈ 8 + 4.62 + 9.24\nPerimeter ≈ 21.86 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is approximately 21.86 cm."
