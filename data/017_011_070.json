The direct product of two cyclic groups, C_2 x C_6 (generated by an element of order 2 and an element of order 6).\n3. The direct product of two cyclic groups, C_3 x C_4 (generated by an element of order 3 and an element of order 4).\n4. The alternating group A_4 (the group of even permutations of 4 elements).\n5. The dihedral group D_6 (the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon).\n\nThese are all the non-isomorphic groups of order 12."
