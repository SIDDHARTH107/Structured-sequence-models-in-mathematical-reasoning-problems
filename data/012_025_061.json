Start at vertex A.\n2. The nearest unvisited vertex to A is B with a weight of 1. Move to vertex B.\n3. The nearest unvisited vertex to B is C with a weight of 2. Move to vertex C.\n4. The nearest unvisited vertex to C is D with a weight of 3. Move to vertex D.\n5. The nearest unvisited vertex to D is E with a weight of 4. Move to vertex E.\n6. The nearest unvisited vertex to E is F with a weight of 5. Move to vertex F.\n7. All vertices have been visited. Return to vertex A with a weight of 6.\n\nThe shortest Hamiltonian cycle using the nearest neighbor algorithm is A → B → C → D → E → F → A with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21."
