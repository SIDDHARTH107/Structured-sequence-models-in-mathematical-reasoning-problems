The cost of transporting one unit of goods from each warehouse to each store is known. \n\nThe demand and availability of the goods are given as follows:\n\nWarehouse 1: 100 units\nWarehouse 2: 150 units\nWarehouse 3: 200 units\nWarehouse 4: 150 units\n\nStore 1: 50 units\nStore 2: 150 units\nStore 3: 50 units\nStore 4: 100 units\nStore 5: 150 units\nStore 6: 200 units\nStore 7: 100 units\nStore 8: 50 units\n\nThe cost of transporting one unit of goods from each warehouse to each store is given in the table below:\n\n|          | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 | Store 6 | Store 7 | Store 8 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n|W arehouse 1|    $20      |    $10      |   $30       |   $25       |    $15      |   $35       |   $18       |   $12       |\n|Warehouse 2|  $18        |   $12       |   $28       |  $22        |    $17      |  $30        |  $20        |  $16        |\n|Warehouse 3|   $13       |   $8        |  $24        |  $15        |   $12       |  $28        |  $16        |   $10       |\n|Warehouse 4|   $17       |  $11        |  $25        |  $20        |   $14       | $32         |   $22       |   $18       |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of transporting the goods from the warehouses to the stores that satisfies the demand and availability of goods?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of transporting the goods, we can use the transportation algorithm, which is a special case of the linear programming problem. We will use the Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) to find an initial feasible solution and then apply the stepping stone method to optimize the solution.\n\n1. Calculate the penalty cost for each row and column by subtracting the smallest cost from the second smallest cost in each row and column.\n\n2. Select the row or column with the highest penalty cost. If there is a tie, choose any one of them.\n\n3. Allocate as many units as possible to the cell with the lowest cost in the selected row or column. The allocation should not exceed the supply or demand.\n\n4. Cross out the row or column that has its supply or demand completely satisfied.\n\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all supplies and demands are satisfied.\n\nInitial allocation using VAM:\n\n|          | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 | Store 6 | Store 7 | Store 8 | Supply |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|\n|Warehouse 1|         |  100     |         |         |         |         |         |         |  100  |\n|Warehouse 2|         |  50      |         |         |  100     |         |         |         |  150  |\n|Warehouse 3|  50      |         |         |  100     |  50      |         |         |         |  200  |\n|Warehouse 4|         |         |  50      |         |         |  100     |  100     |         |  150  |\n| Demand   |  50      |  150     |  50      |  100     |  150     |  100     |  100     |  50      |  600  |\n\nNow, calculate the total cost of this initial allocation:\n\n(100 * $10) + (50 * $12) + (100 * $17) + (50 * $13) + (100 * $15) + (50 * $12) + (50 * $25) + (100 * $32) + (100 * $22) = $1000 + $600 + $1700 + $650 + $1500 + $600 + $1250 + $3200 + $2200 = $12700\n\nSince there are no unallocated cells with a lower cost in any row or column, this is the minimum cost solution. The minimum cost of transporting the goods from the warehouses to the stores that satisfies the demand and availability of goods is $12,700."
