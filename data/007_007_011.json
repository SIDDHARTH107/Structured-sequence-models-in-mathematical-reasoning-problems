    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 7x + 12y = 31, we first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 12.\n\nThe GCD(7, 12) = 1, since 7 is a prime number and does not divide 12. Since the GCD(7, 12) divides 31, there exists a solution to the Diophantine equation.\n\nNow, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers x and y such that 7x + 12y = GCD(7, 12) = 1.\n\n7 = 1 * 7 + 0 * 12\n12 = 0 * 7 + 1 * 12\n\nWe can rewrite 12 as a linear combination of 7 and 12:\n12 = 1 * 12 - 1 * 7\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by 31 to get the desired equation:\n31 = 31 * (1 * 12 - 1 * 7)\n31 = 31 * 12 - 31 * 7\n\nSo, one solution is x = -31 and y = 31.\n\nHowever, there are infinitely many solutions to this Diophantine equation. To find the general solution, we can use the following formula:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions we found (x0 = -31, y0 = 31), a = 7, b = 12, d = GCD(7, 12) = 1, and n is an integer.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nx = -31 + 12n\ny = 31 - 7n\n\nFor any integer value of n, this will give a valid solution for the Diophantine equation."
