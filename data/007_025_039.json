Alice chooses a secret number a=4 and Bob chooses a secret number b=3. What is the shared secret key that they will use for encryption?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, we first need to calculate Alice's and Bob's public keys.\n\nAlice's public key (A) is calculated as follows:\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 5^4 mod 23\nA = 625 mod 23\nA = 6\n\nBob's public key (B) is calculated as follows:\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 5^3 mod 23\nB = 125 mod 23\nB = 10\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using each other's public keys.\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key (S) as follows:\nS = B^a mod p\nS = 10^4 mod 23\nS = 10000 mod 23\nS = 18\n\nBob computes the shared secret key (S) as follows:\nS = A^b mod p\nS = 6^3 mod 23\nS = 216 mod 23\nS = 18\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key, S = 18. This will be the key they use for encryption."
