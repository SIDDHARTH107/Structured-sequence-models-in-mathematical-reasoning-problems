    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. Find the Cartesian product A × B and B × A, and show that they are not equal, thus demonstrating that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product A × B, we form ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. Similarly, for B × A, we form ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets:\n\nA × B ≠ B × A\n\nThis is because the ordered pairs in A × B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B × A. For example, (1, 4) is in A × B, but not in B × A. Similarly, (4, 1) is in B × A, but not in A × B.\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
