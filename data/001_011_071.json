    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3x - 4)/(x + 1) = 2/3, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(3x - 4)(3) = (x + 1)(2)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n9x - 12 = 2x + 2\n\nNext, subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n7x - 12 = 2\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n7x = 14\n\nFinally, divide by 7:\n\nx = 2"
