    "message_2": "The chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn the given graph G, we can color the edges as follows:\n\n```\n   A --- B (color 1)\n   |     |\n   C --- D (color 1)\n```\n\n```\n   A (color 2)\n   |     \n   C (color 2)\n```\n\n```\n   B (color 3)\n   |     \n   D (color 3)\n```\n\nWith this coloring, no two adjacent edges share the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index χ'(G) of the graph G is 3."
