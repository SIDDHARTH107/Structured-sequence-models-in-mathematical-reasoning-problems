    "message_2": "A phase shift is the horizontal shift of a trigonometric function. The general form of a sine function is:\n\nf(x) = A * sin(B * (x - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given function, f(x) = 2sin(3x - π/2), we can see that:\n\nA = 2\nB = 3\nC = π/2\nD = 0\n\nThe phase shift is C, which in this case is π/2. However, we need to consider the direction of the shift. Since the function is in the form of sin(B * (x - C)), the phase shift is to the right. Therefore, the phase shift of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x - π/2) is to the right by π/2 units."
