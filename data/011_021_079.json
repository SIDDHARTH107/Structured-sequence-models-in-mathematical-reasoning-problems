The distances between the cities are as follows:\n\nA to B: 20 km  \nA to C: 15 km  \nA to D: 40 km  \nB to C: 25 km  \nB to D: 30 km  \nC to D: 10 km  \nC to E: 35 km  \nC to F: 20 km  \nD to E: 15 km  \nD to F: 50 km  \nE to F: 30 km  \n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance the salesman can travel, visiting each city only once and returning to city F?",
    "message_2": "Since the salesman needs to visit the cities in a specific order, we can simply add the distances between each consecutive city in the given order. \n\nThe order is A → B → C → D → E → F.\n\nThe distances between these cities are:\n\nA to B: 20 km\nB to C: 25 km\nC to D: 10 km\nD to E: 15 km\nE to F: 30 km\n\nNow, we add these distances together:\n\n20 km + 25 km + 10 km + 15 km + 30 km = 100 km\n\nTherefore, the shortest possible distance the salesman can travel, visiting each city only once and returning to city F, is 100 km."
