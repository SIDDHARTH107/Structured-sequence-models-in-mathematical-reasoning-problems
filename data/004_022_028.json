    "message_1": "A company wants to manufacture cylindrical cans of radius 5 cm and height 20 cm. The company wants to minimize the cost of material used to create these cans, which is proportional to the surface area of the can. The can must hold at least 400 mL of liquid. What is the minimum cost of material and how many cans can be made from 1 square meter of material?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the volume of the cylindrical can with the given dimensions:\n\nVolume = π * r^2 * h\nVolume = π * (5 cm)^2 * 20 cm\nVolume = π * 25 cm^2 * 20 cm\nVolume = 500π cm^3\n\nSince 1 mL is equal to 1 cm^3, the volume of the can is 500π mL. This is greater than the required 400 mL, so the dimensions are acceptable.\n\nNow, let's find the surface area of the can, which consists of the lateral surface area and the two circular bases:\n\nLateral surface area = 2π * r * h\nLateral surface area = 2π * 5 cm * 20 cm\nLateral surface area = 200π cm^2\n\nArea of one circular base = π * r^2\nArea of one circular base = π * (5 cm)^2\nArea of one circular base = 25π cm^2\n\nTotal surface area of the can = Lateral surface area + 2 * Area of one circular base\nTotal surface area = 200π cm^2 + 2 * 25π cm^2\nTotal surface area = 200π cm^2 + 50π cm^2\nTotal surface area = 250π cm^2\n\nNow, let's convert the surface area to square meters:\n\n1 cm^2 = 0.0001 m^2\n\nTotal surface area = 250π * 0.0001 m^2\nTotal surface area ≈ 0.07854 m^2\n\nThe minimum cost of material is proportional to the surface area, so the minimum cost is proportional to 0.07854 m^2.\n\nTo find out how many cans can be made from 1 square meter of material, divide 1 by the surface area of one can:\n\nNumber of cans = 1 m^2 / 0.07854 m^2\nNumber of cans ≈ 12.73\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a can, the company can make 12 cans from 1 square meter of material."
