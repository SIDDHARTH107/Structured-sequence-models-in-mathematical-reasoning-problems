    "message_2": "The smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the difference between two prime numbers is 2. \n\nExplanation: \nEvery even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, according to the Goldbach Conjecture. However, the difference between two prime numbers can only be even if one of the prime numbers is 2 (since all other prime numbers are odd). So, for an even number to be expressed as the difference between two prime numbers, it must be in the form of (P - 2), where P is a prime number.\n\nFor the smallest even number, 2, there is no prime number P such that P - 2 = 2, as that would require P to be equal to 4, which is not a prime number. Therefore, 2 is the smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the difference between two prime numbers."
