    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, two players are given a sum of money to divide between themselves. Player 1 proposes a split, and if Player 2 accepts, both players receive the proposed amounts. If Player 2 rejects the proposal, neither player receives any money. If the players are rational and only care about their own payoffs, what is the minimum amount of money that Player 1 should offer Player 2 if they are given $100 to split?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, if both players are rational and only care about their own payoffs, Player 1 should offer the minimum amount that Player 2 would accept. Since any amount of money is better than no money, Player 2 would rationally accept any offer greater than $0. Therefore, the minimum amount Player 1 should offer Player 2 is $1, keeping $99 for themselves."
