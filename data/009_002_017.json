    "message_1": "A town has a population of 10,000 people. A new infectious disease has started spreading in the town with an initial infection rate of 50 people per day. The recovery rate of the infected people is 10% per day. Assuming that there are no measures taken to control the spread of the disease, write a differential equation to model the spread of the disease and find the number of infected people after 10 days.",
    "message_2": "Let I(t) be the number of infected people at time t (in days). The infection rate is 50 people per day, and the recovery rate is 10% per day. Therefore, the rate of change of the number of infected people can be described by the following differential equation:\n\ndI/dt = 50 - 0.1 * I(t)\n\nTo find the number of infected people after 10 days, we need to solve this differential equation. We can do this by separating variables and integrating:\n\n(1/I'(t) + 0.1) dI = dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/I'(t) + 0.1) dI = ∫ dt\n\nln(I'(t) + 0.1) = 0.1t + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition. At t=0, I(0) = 0 (assuming no one is infected initially):\n\nln(0.1) = 0.1 * 0 + C\n\nC = ln(0.1)\n\nNow we can write the general solution:\n\nln(I'(t) + 0.1) = 0.1t + ln(0.1)\n\nI'(t) + 0.1 = 0.1 * e^(0.1t)\n\nI'(t) = 0.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1\n\nNow, we can find the number of infected people after 10 days:\n\nI'(10) = 0.1 * e^(0.1 * 10) - 0.1\nI'(10) = 0.1 * e - 0.1 ≈ 0.1718\n\nHowever, this is the rate of change of the number of infected people at t=10. To find the total number of infected people after 10 days, we need to integrate I'(t) from 0 to 10:\n\nI(10) = ∫(0.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1) dt from 0 to 10\n\nI(10) = [e^(0.1t) - 0.1t] from 0 to 10\n\nI(10) = (e - 0.1 * 10) - (1 - 0) = e - 1 ≈ 1.718\n\nHowever, this result seems incorrect, as it is not consistent with the initial infection rate of 50 people per day. The issue is that we assumed no one was infected initially, which is not true. Let's reconsider the problem with the correct initial condition:\n\nAt t=0, I(0) = 50:\n\nln(50 + 0.1) = 0.1 * 0 + C\n\nC = ln(50.1)\n\nNow we can write the general solution:\n\nln(I'(t) + 0.1) = 0.1t + ln(50.1)\n\nI'(t) + 0.1 = 50.1 * e^(0.1t)\n\nI'(t) = 50.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1\n\nNow, we can find the number of infected people after 10 days:\n\nI(10) = ∫(50.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1) dt from 0 to 10\n\nI(10) = [500.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1t] from 0 to 10\n\nI(10) = (500.1 * e - 0.1 * 10) - (500.1 * 1 - 0) ≈ 500.1 * (e - 1) ≈ 818.7\n\nSo, after 10 days, there will be approximately 818.7 infected people in the town."
