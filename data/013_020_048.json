    "message_1": "In the Beauty Contest Game, there are 100 players who must choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner will be the person who chooses a number closest to 2/3 of the average of all the numbers chosen by the players. If two or more players choose the same number closest to 2/3 of the average, the one who entered the number first will win. \n\nWhat number should you choose to maximize your chances of winning the Beauty Contest Game?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning the Beauty Contest Game, you should try to predict what the average of all the numbers chosen by the players will be, and then choose a number that is 2/3 of that predicted average.\n\nAssuming that all players are rational and aiming to win, they will also try to predict the average and choose 2/3 of that value. This creates a recursive process, where each player is trying to predict the predictions of the other players.\n\nIn the first round of predictions, if players assume that everyone else will choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average would be 50. So, in this case, you would choose 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players are rational, they will also choose 33.33 in the first round. In the second round of predictions, you would assume that everyone else will choose 33.33, so the new average would be 33.33, and you would choose 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nThis process continues, and the chosen numbers will converge towards 0. In practice, you should choose a number slightly above 0 to maximize your chances of winning, as the recursive process will not go on indefinitely, and other players might not be perfectly rational. A safe choice could be around 1 or 2, but the exact optimal number depends on the level of rationality and strategic thinking of the other players."
