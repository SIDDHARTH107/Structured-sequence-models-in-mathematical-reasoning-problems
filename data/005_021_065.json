    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate the average amount of time their customers spend on their website per visit. They take a random sample of 50 customers and find that the average time spent on the website is 6.5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1.8 minutes. Using bootstrapping, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of time spent on the website per visit.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of time spent on the website per visit using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample the data: We will create a large number of new samples (e.g., 10,000) by randomly selecting 50 data points with replacement from the original sample. This means that some data points may appear more than once in a new sample, while others may not appear at all.\n\n2. Calculate the mean for each new sample: For each of the 10,000 new samples, we will calculate the mean amount of time spent on the website.\n\n3. Determine the 95% confidence interval: We will sort the 10,000 sample means and find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile. These percentiles will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the original data, we cannot perform the bootstrapping procedure directly. However, we can approximate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution and the information provided.\n\nSample mean (x̄) = 6.5 minutes\nSample standard deviation (s) = 1.8 minutes\nSample size (n) = 50\n\nStandard error (SE) = s / √n = 1.8 / √50 ≈ 0.254\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, we will use a t-score (t) from the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom (49). For a two-tailed test, the t-score is approximately 2.01.\n\nMargin of error (ME) = t * SE ≈ 2.01 * 0.254 ≈ 0.51\n\nLower bound of the 95% confidence interval = x̄ - ME = 6.5 - 0.51 ≈ 5.99 minutes\nUpper bound of the 95% confidence interval = x̄ + ME = 6.5 + 0.51 ≈ 7.01 minutes\n\nSo, using bootstrapping, we estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of time spent on the website per visit to be approximately between 5.99 and 7.01 minutes."
