    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime number greater than 50 that can be written in the form 6n + 1, we can start by finding the smallest value of n that makes 6n + 1 greater than 50:\n\n6n + 1 > 50\n6n > 49\nn > 49/6\nn > 8.16\n\nSince n must be a positive integer, the smallest value of n that satisfies the inequality is n = 9. Now, we can plug this value of n into the equation 6n + 1:\n\n6(9) + 1 = 54 + 1 = 55\n\nHowever, 55 is not a prime number, as it can be factored into 5 * 11. We can continue testing the next values of n until we find a prime number:\n\nn = 10: 6(10) + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61\n\n61 is a prime number, as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the smallest prime number greater than 50 that can be written in the form 6n + 1 is 61."
