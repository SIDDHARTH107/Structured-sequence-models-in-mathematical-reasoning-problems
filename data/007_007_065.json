    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 2x + 5y = 41, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the integer solutions.\n\nFirst, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 and 5 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n5 = 2 * 2 + 1\n2 = 1 * 2\n\nThe GCD of 2 and 5 is 1. Since 1 divides 41, there are integer solutions for x and y.\n\nNow, let's use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients for the Bézout's identity:\n\n1 = 5 - 2 * 2\n1 = 5 - 2 * (5 - 2 * 2)\n1 = 5 - 2 * 5 + 2 * 2 * 2\n1 = -2 * 5 + 4 * 2\n\nSo, the Bézout's identity for 2 and 5 is:\n\n1 = -2 * 5 + 4 * 2\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 41 to get:\n\n41 = -2 * 5 * 41 + 4 * 2 * 41\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in the form of the original Diophantine equation:\n\n41 = 2 * (4 * 41) + 5 * (-2 * 41)\n\nSo, one solution for the Diophantine equation is:\n\nx = 4 * 41 = 164\ny = -2 * 41 = -82\n\nHowever, this is not the only solution. Since the GCD of 2 and 5 is 1, there are infinitely many solutions for x and y. We can find the general solution by adding multiples of the coefficients of the Bézout's identity:\n\nx = 164 + 5t\ny = -82 - 2t\n\nwhere t is any integer."
