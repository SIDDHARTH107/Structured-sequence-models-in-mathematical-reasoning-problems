    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |sin(x)|, we first need to find its Fourier coefficients c_n. Since f(x) is an even function (f(-x) = f(x)), we know that the Fourier series will only contain cosine terms. Therefore, we can represent f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + ∑ (n=1)^(∞) a_n cos(nx)\n\nwhere a_n is the nth Fourier coefficient, given by:\n\na_n = (1/π) ∫(π,-π) f(x) cos(nx) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients a_n. First, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) ∫(π,-π) |sin(x)| dx\n\nTo compute this integral, we can split it into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) [∫(π,0) -sin(x) dx + ∫(0,-π) sin(x) dx]\n\na_0 = (1/π) [(-cos(π) + cos(0)) + (cos(0) - cos(π))]\n\na_0 = (1/π) [2 + 2] = 4/π\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_n for n ≥ 1:\n\na_n = (1/π) ∫(π,-π) |sin(x)| cos(nx) dx\n\nAgain, we can split this integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1/π) [∫(π,0) -sin(x) cos(nx) dx + ∫(0,-π) sin(x) cos(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve these integrals. Let u = sin(x) and dv = cos(nx) dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = (1/n) sin(nx).\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\na_n = (1/π) [(1/n) [sin(x) sin(nx)](π,0) - (1/n) ∫(π,0) cos(x) sin(nx) dx + (1/n) [sin(x) sin(nx)](-π,0) - (1/n) ∫(0,-π) cos(x) sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we notice that sin(x) sin(nx) is zero at x = 0 and x = ±π. Therefore, the first and third terms in the expression above are zero. We are left with:\n\na_n = (1/π) [-(1/n) ∫(π,0) cos(x) sin(nx) dx - (1/n) ∫(0,-π) cos(x) sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we can combine the integrals:\n\na_n = -(1/nπ) ∫(π,-π) cos(x) sin(nx) dx\n\nTo compute this integral, we can use the product-to-sum trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(A)cos(B) = 1/2 [sin(A-B) - sin(A+B)]\n\nApplying this identity, we get:\n\na_n = -(1/2nπ) ∫(π,-π) [sin((n-1)x) - sin((n+1)x)] dx\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\na_n = -(1/2nπ) [(-1/(n-1))cos((n-1)x) + (1/(n+1))cos((n+1)x)](π,-π)\n\nEvaluating the integral, we find that the cos((n-1)x) and cos((n+1)x) terms are zero for odd values of n-1 and n+1 at x = ±π. Therefore, the Fourier coefficients a_n are:\n\na_n = 0 for n even\n\na_n = -2/(nπ) for n odd\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = |sin(x)|:\n\nf(x) = (4/π) + ∑ (n=1,3,5,...) (-2/(nπ)) cos(nx)\n\nTo determine the convergence of this Fourier series, we can use the Dirichlet's test for convergence. The Dirichlet's test states that if the partial sums of the coefficients a_n are bounded and the function cos(nx) is a decreasing function of x, then the Fourier series converges.\n\nIn our case, the partial sums of the coefficients a_n are:\n\nS_N = ∑ (n=1,3,5,...,N) (-2/(nπ))\n\nSince the terms (-2/(nπ)) are alternating and decreasing in magnitude, the partial sums S_N are bounded. Moreover, the function cos(nx) is a decreasing function of x for n ≥ 1. Therefore, by Dirichlet's test, the Fourier series converges.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |sin(x)| converges conditionally."
