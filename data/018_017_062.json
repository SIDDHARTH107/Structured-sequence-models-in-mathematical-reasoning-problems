    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference (A × B) △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\n(A × B) △ B = { (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4) } △ {2, 3, 4}\n\nSince none of the elements in B are ordered pairs, there is no intersection between (A × B) and B. Therefore, the symmetric difference is just the union of the two sets:\n\n(A × B) △ B = { (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), 2, 3, 4 }"
