    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity. We can do this by iterating through all possible x values in the finite field and checking if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation.\n\nThe equation for the elliptic curve is y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 2 (mod 11).\n\nWe will iterate through x values from 0 to 10 and find the corresponding y values:\n\nx = 0: y^2 = 0^3 + 3*0 + 2 (mod 11) = 2 (mod 11)\nThere are two y values that satisfy this equation: y = 5 and y = 6.\n\nx = 1: y^2 = 1^3 + 3*1 + 2 (mod 11) = 6 (mod 11)\nThere are two y values that satisfy this equation: y = 4 and y = 7.\n\nx = 2: y^2 = 2^3 + 3*2 + 2 (mod 11) = 8 (mod 11)\nThere are no y values that satisfy this equation.\n\nx = 3: y^2 = 3^3 + 3*3 + 2 (mod 11) = 1 (mod 11)\nThere are two y values that satisfy this equation: y = 1 and y = 10.\n\nx = 4: y^2 = 4^3 + 3*4 + 2 (mod 11) = 10 (mod 11)\nThere are no y values that satisfy this equation.\n\nx = 5: y^2 = 5^3 + 3*5 + 2 (mod 11) = 4 (mod 11)\nThere are two y values that satisfy this equation: y = 2 and y = 9.\n\nx = 6: y^2 = 6^3 + 3*6 + 2 (mod 11) = 4 (mod 11)\nThere are two y values that satisfy this equation: y = 2 and y = 9.\n\nx = 7: y^2 = 7^3 + 3*7 + 2 (mod 11) = 1 (mod 11)\nThere are two y values that satisfy this equation: y = 1 and y = 10.\n\nx = 8: y^2 = 8^3 + 3*8 + 2 (mod 11) = 10 (mod 11)\nThere are no y values that satisfy this equation.\n\nx = 9: y^2 = 9^3 + 3*9 + 2 (mod 11) = 6 (mod 11)\nThere are two y values that satisfy this equation: y = 4 and y = 7.\n\nx = 10: y^2 = 10^3 + 3*10 + 2 (mod 11) = 2 (mod 11)\nThere are two y values that satisfy this equation: y = 5 and y = 6.\n\nNow, we count the number of points we found: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 points. We also need to include the point at infinity, so the order of the elliptic curve is 12 + 1 = 13."
