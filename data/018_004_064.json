    "message_2": "The complement of B in A, denoted as A\\B or A - B, is the set of all elements in A that are not in B. Since B is a subset of A with 12 elements, there must be 20 - 12 = 8 elements in the complement of B in A.\n\nTo prove that the complement is unique, we need to show that there can be only one such set with 8 elements that satisfies the condition of being the complement of B in A.\n\nLet's assume there are two different complements of B in A, called C and D. This means that C and D both contain elements from A that are not in B, and C ≠ D.\n\nSince C and D are both complements of B in A, we know that:\n1. A = B ∪ C\n2. A = B ∪ D\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of C and D:\nC ∩ D = (B ∪ C) ∩ (B ∪ D) = A ∩ (B ∪ D) = A ∩ A = A\n\nSince C and D are both subsets of A, their intersection must also be a subset of A. However, we just showed that their intersection is equal to A, which means that C and D must contain all the elements of A that are not in B.\n\nSince there are only 8 elements in A that are not in B, and both C and D contain all of these elements, it must be the case that C = D. This contradicts our initial assumption that C ≠ D.\n\nTherefore, there can be only one unique complement of B in A, which contains 8 elements."
