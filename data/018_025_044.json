The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}\nA ∩ B = {3, 5, 7}\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA ∆ B = {2, 11, 13, 17}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∩ B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {13, 17}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B ∆ A:\n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}\nB ∩ A = {3, 5, 7}\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nB ∆ A = {2, 11, 13, 17}\n\nNow, let's find (B ∆ A) ∩ A:\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ A = {2, 11}\n\nNotice that (A ∆ B) ∩ B ≠ (B ∆ A) ∩ A, since {13, 17} ≠ {2, 11}. This shows that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection."
