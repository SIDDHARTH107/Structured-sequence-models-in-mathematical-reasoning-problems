    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 17^23 is divided by 11, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We know that:\n\n17 ≡ 6 (mod 11) since 17 - 6 = 11\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 6^23 is divided by 11. We can do this by breaking down the exponent:\n\n6^23 = (6^2)^11 * 6^1\n\nNow, let's find the remainder of 6^2 when divided by 11:\n\n6^2 = 36 ≡ 3 (mod 11) since 36 - 3 = 33\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our original equation:\n\n(6^2)^11 * 6^1 ≡ 3^11 * 6 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 3^11 is divided by 11. We can break down the exponent again:\n\n3^11 = (3^2)^5 * 3^1\n\nNow, let's find the remainder of 3^2 when divided by 11:\n\n3^2 = 9 ≡ 9 (mod 11) since 9 - 0 = 9\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our equation:\n\n(3^2)^5 * 3^1 ≡ 9^5 * 3 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 9^5 is divided by 11. We can break down the exponent again:\n\n9^5 = (9^2)^2 * 9^1\n\nNow, let's find the remainder of 9^2 when divided by 11:\n\n9^2 = 81 ≡ 4 (mod 11) since 81 - 4 = 77\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our equation:\n\n(9^2)^2 * 9^1 ≡ 4^2 * 9 (mod 11)\n\nNow, let's find the remainder of 4^2 when divided by 11:\n\n4^2 = 16 ≡ 5 (mod 11) since 16 - 5 = 11\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our equation:\n\n4^2 * 9 ≡ 5 * 9 (mod 11)\n\nNow, let's find the remainder of 5 * 9 when divided by 11:\n\n5 * 9 = 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11) since 45 - 1 = 44\n\nSo, the remainder when 17^23 is divided by 11 is 1."
