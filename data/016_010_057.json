    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by starting with three mutually tangent circles and repeatedly filling in the interstices with new tangent circles. The curvatures of the circles in an Apollonian gasket follow Descartes' Circle Theorem, which states that if four mutually tangent circles have curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4, then (k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2).\n\nGiven the initial curvatures 1, 2, and 3, we can find the curvature of the fourth circle using Descartes' Circle Theorem:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n(1 + 2 + 3 + k4)^2 = 2(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + k4^2)\n(6 + k4)^2 = 2(14 + k4^2)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n36 + 12k4 + k4^2 = 28 + 2k4^2\nk4^2 - 12k4 + 8 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for k4: k4 = 2 and k4 = 4. However, since the fourth circle must be tangent to all three initial circles, it must have a larger curvature than any of them, so we choose k4 = 4.\n\nNow, for each new circle added to the gasket, three more circles will be created in the interstices. However, the Apollonian gasket is a fractal, meaning it has an infinite number of circles as we keep adding circles indefinitely. Therefore, the total number of circles in the Apollonian gasket starting with three mutually tangent circles with curvatures 1, 2, and 3 is infinite."
