    "message_2": "To calculate the Hodge star operator on the 2-dimensional manifold M, we first need to find the metric tensor g_ij and its determinant. The metric tensor is given by the dot product of the partial derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to u and v.\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives of x and y with respect to u and v:\n\n∂x/∂u = 2u\n∂x/∂v = -2v\n∂y/∂u = 2v\n∂y/∂v = 2u\n\nNow, let's find the metric tensor g_ij:\n\ng_11 = (∂x/∂u)^2 + (∂y/∂u)^2 = (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\ng_12 = g_21 = (∂x/∂u)(∂x/∂v) + (∂y/∂u)(∂y/∂v) = (2u)(-2v) + (2v)(2u) = 0\ng_22 = (∂x/∂v)^2 + (∂y/∂v)^2 = (-2v)^2 + (2u)^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\n\nThe metric tensor g_ij is:\n\ng_ij = | 4(u^2 + v^2)    0    |\n       |      0      4(u^2 + v^2) |\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the metric tensor:\n\ndet(g_ij) = 4(u^2 + v^2)^2 - 0 = 16(u^2 + v^2)^2\n\nSince we are working on a 2-dimensional manifold, the Hodge star operator acts on 1-forms and 2-forms. Let α be a 1-form and β be a 2-form. Then, the Hodge star operator is defined as:\n\n*(α) = (√(det(g_ij)) / (2!)) * α^ij * ε_ij\n*(β) = (√(det(g_ij)) / (1!)) * β^i * ε_i\n\nwhere ε_ij and ε_i are the Levi-Civita symbols.\n\nFor this problem, we have calculated the determinant of the metric tensor, which is needed to compute the Hodge star operator on the given manifold."
