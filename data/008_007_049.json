    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we first need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. \n\nStep 1: Find the eigenvalues\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [4-λ 2; 1 3-λ]\n\nThe determinant of (A - λI) is:\n\n(4-λ)(3-λ) - (2)(1) = λ^2 - 7λ + 10\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we set the determinant equal to zero:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 10 = 0\n\nFactoring the equation, we get:\n\n(λ - 2)(λ - 5) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 5.\n\nStep 2: Find the eigenvectors\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n\n(A - 2I)v1 = 0\n[2 2; 1 1]v1 = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\n2x + 2y = 0\nx + y = 0\n\nWe can find the eigenvector v1 by solving the system of equations:\n\ny = -x\nv1 = x[-1; 1]\n\nWe can choose x = 1, so v1 = [-1; 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 5:\n\n(A - 5I)v2 = 0\n[-1 2; 1 -2]v2 = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\n-x + 2y = 0\nx - 2y = 0\n\nWe can find the eigenvector v2 by solving the system of equations:\n\nx = 2y\nv2 = x[2; 1]\n\nWe can choose y = 1, so v2 = [2; 1].\n\nStep 3: Form the matrix P and diagonal matrix D\nNow that we have the eigenvectors, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [-1 2; 1 1]\n\nThe diagonal matrix D will have the eigenvalues on its diagonal:\n\nD = [2 0; 0 5]\n\nStep 4: Verify A = PDP^(-1)\nTo verify that A = PDP^(-1), we need to find the inverse of P, P^(-1), and then multiply PDP^(-1).\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of P:\n\nP = [-1 2; 1 1]\n\nThe determinant of P is:\n\ndet(P) = (-1)(1) - (2)(1) = -3\n\nThe adjugate of P is:\n\nadj(P) = [1 -2; -1 -1]\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of P:\n\nP^(-1) = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = (-1/3)[1 -2; -1 -1]\n\nNow, let's multiply PDP^(-1):\n\nPDP^(-1) = [-1 2; 1 1][2 0; 0 5](-1/3)[1 -2; -1 -1]\n\nMultiplying the first two matrices:\n\n[-1 2; 1 1][2 0; 0 5] = [-1*2 + 2*0, -1*0 + 2*5; 1*2 + 1*0, 1*0 + 1*5] = [-2 10; 2 5]\n\nNow, multiplying the result by P^(-1):\n\n[-2 10; 2 5](-1/3)[1 -2; -1 -1] = (-1/3)[-2 - 10; 2 + 5][-2 -1; 1 1]\n\nMultiplying the matrices:\n\n(-1/3)[4 2; 1 3]\n\nFinally, multiplying by -1/3:\n\n[4 2; 1 3]\n\nThis is equal to the original matrix A, so we have successfully diagonalized the matrix:\n\nA = PDP^(-1) = [-1 2; 1 1][2 0; 0 5](-1/3)[1 -2; -1 -1]"
