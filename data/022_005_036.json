    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z = -1, we first need to factor the denominator and find the order of the pole.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^2 + 4z + 3 = (z + 1)(z + 3)\n\nNow we can see that the pole z = -1 is a simple pole (order 1) since the factor (z + 1) appears only once in the denominator.\n\nTo find the residue, we can use the formula for the residue of a simple pole:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * f(z)]\n\nSubstitute f(z) into the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * ((2z^2 + 5z + 6) / ((z + 1)(z + 3)))]\n\nSimplify the expression by canceling out the (z + 1) term:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(2z^2 + 5z + 6) / (z + 3)]\n\nNow, evaluate the limit as z approaches -1:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = (2(-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 6) / (-1 + 3)\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = (2 - 5 + 6) / 2\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = 3 / 2\n\nSo, the residue of f(z) at the pole z = -1 is 3/2."
