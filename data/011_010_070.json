    "message_1": "A student is organizing a debate competition with 10 participants. In how many ways can the order of the speakers be arranged if the first and the last speakers must be the judges of the debate?",
    "message_2": "There are 10 participants, and 2 of them must be the judges. So, there are 8 remaining participants who can be speakers.\n\nSince the first and last speakers must be the judges, we have 2 choices for the first speaker and 1 choice for the last speaker (the other judge). Now, we need to arrange the remaining 8 speakers.\n\nThere are 8! (8 factorial) ways to arrange the 8 speakers. So, the total number of ways to arrange the speakers with the given condition is:\n\n2 (choices for the first speaker) * 1 (choice for the last speaker) * 8! (arrangements for the remaining speakers) = 2 * 1 * 8! = 2 * 40320 = 80640 ways."
