    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) + 3x * cos(x), we will use the product rule and the sum rule. The sum rule states that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, and the product rule states that the derivative of a product is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function.\n\nLet's first find the derivatives of the individual functions:\n\n1. Derivative of x^2: Using the power rule, the derivative is 2x.\n2. Derivative of sin(x): The derivative is cos(x).\n3. Derivative of 3x: The derivative is 3.\n4. Derivative of cos(x): The derivative is -sin(x).\n\nNow, let's apply the product rule and sum rule:\n\nf'(x) = (2x * sin(x) + x^2 * cos(x)) + (3 * cos(x) + 3x * (-sin(x)))\n\nNow, we will evaluate f'(x) at x = pi/4:\n\nf'(pi/4) = (2(pi/4) * sin(pi/4) + (pi/4)^2 * cos(pi/4)) + (3 * cos(pi/4) - 3(pi/4) * sin(pi/4))\n\nSince sin(pi/4) = cos(pi/4) = √2/2, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\nf'(pi/4) = (2(pi/4) * (√2/2) + (pi/4)^2 * (√2/2)) + (3 * (√2/2) - 3(pi/4) * (√2/2))\n\nNow, let's simplify:\n\nf'(pi/4) = (pi * (√2/2) + (pi^2/16) * (√2/2)) + (3√2/2 - 3π√2/8)\n\nf'(pi/4) = (π√2/2 + π^2√2/32) + (3√2/2 - 3π√2/8)\n\nNow, we can combine like terms:\n\nf'(pi/4) = (π√2/2 - 3π√2/8) + (3√2/2 + π^2√2/32)\n\nf'(pi/4) = (π√2/8) + (3√2/2 + π^2√2/32)\n\nThis is the value of the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) + 3x * cos(x) at x = pi/4."
