    "message_2": "a) To show that the curve is smooth, we need to check that the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to the variables $s, u, v, w$ do not simultaneously vanish at any point on the curve.\n\nThe equation of the curve is given by $t^2 = su^2 + uv^2 + vw^2$. Let's compute the partial derivatives with respect to each variable:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} = u^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} = 2su + 2uv$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} = 2uv + 2w^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w} = 2vw$\n\nNow, we need to check if there is any point on the curve where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. Suppose they do, then we have:\n\n$u^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow u = 0$\n\n$2su + 2uv = 0 \\Rightarrow v = -\\frac{s}{u}v \\Rightarrow v = 0$ (since $u = 0$)\n\n$2uv + 2w^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow w^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow w = 0$\n\n$2vw = 0 \\Rightarrow v = 0$ (since $w = 0$)\n\nHowever, the point $(u:v:w:t) = (0:0:0:1)$ is not on the curve, because it does not satisfy the equation $t^2 = su^2 + uv^2 + vw^2$. Therefore, there is no point on the curve where all the partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, and the curve is smooth.\n\nb) To compute the degree of the curve, we can look at the highest degree of the homogeneous polynomial that defines the curve. In this case, the equation is $t^2 = su^2 + uv^2 + vw^2$. The highest degree term is $t^2$, which has degree 2. Therefore, the degree of the curve is 2.\n\nc) To find the equations of the tangent plane and the normal line to the curve at the point $(u:v:w:t) = (1:0:0:1)$, we first need to compute the gradient of the curve at this point. The gradient is given by the vector of partial derivatives:\n\n$\\nabla = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}\\right) = (u^2, 2su + 2uv, 2uv + 2w^2, 2vw)$\n\nAt the point $(u:v:w:t) = (1:0:0:1)$, the gradient is:\n\n$\\nabla = (1^2, 2(1)(1) + 2(1)(0), 2(1)(0) + 2(0)^2, 2(0)(0)) = (1, 2, 0, 0)$\n\nThe tangent plane at this point is given by the equation:\n\n$\\nabla \\cdot (s - 1, u - 1, v, w) = 0$\n\n$(1, 2, 0, 0) \\cdot (s - 1, u - 1, v, w) = 0$\n\n$s - 1 + 2(u - 1) = 0$\n\n$s + 2u - 3 = 0$\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane is $s + 2u - 3 = 0$.\n\nThe normal line to the curve at this point is given by the parametric equations:\n\n$s(t) = 1 + t$\n\n$u(t) = 1 + 2t$\n\n$v(t) = 0$\n\n$w(t) = 0$\n\nThese are the equations of the tangent plane and the normal line to the curve at the point $(u:v:w:t) = (1:0:0:1)$."
