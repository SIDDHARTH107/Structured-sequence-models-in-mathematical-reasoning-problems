    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, player A is given $10 and must decide how much money to send to player B (any amount from $0 to $10), while player B receives the sent amount and can choose to either keep it all or to send some of it back (any amount from $0 to the amount received). If player B sends back any amount, that amount is tripled before being given to player A. If player B keeps the entire amount, no additional money is exchanged.\n\nIf player A sends $5 to player B, what is the minimum amount that player B needs to send back in order to ensure that both players receive the same amount of money?",
    "message_2": "If player A sends $5 to player B, player A will have $5 left. In order for both players to have the same amount of money, player B needs to ensure that player A ends up with a total of $7.5 (half of the initial $10 each).\n\nSince the amount player B sends back is tripled before being given to player A, we can set up the following equation:\n\n5 + 3x = 7.5\n\nWhere x is the amount player B sends back. Solving for x:\n\n3x = 2.5\nx = 2.5 / 3\nx â‰ˆ 0.8333\n\nSo, player B needs to send back approximately $0.83 to ensure that both players receive the same amount of money."
