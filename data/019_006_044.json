    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is not typically associated with numerical problems. It deals with the study of norms, permissions, and obligations, and focuses on principles that govern how one ought to act. Therefore, it may not be possible to provide a precise numerical problem for the student to solve in this context. Can I assist you with anything else?",
    "message_2": "Of course! If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask. I'm here to help."
