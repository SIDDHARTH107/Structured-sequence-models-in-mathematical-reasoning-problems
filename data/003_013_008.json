    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation that results in the maximum volume of the tank, we will first find the volume of the cone as a function of the angle of elevation, and then find the angle that maximizes the volume using calculus.\n\nLet's denote the angle of elevation as θ. The slant height of the cone, L, can be expressed in terms of the angle θ as follows:\n\nL = 4 / sin(θ)\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the cone. The volume V of a cone is given by the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nIn our case, the height h and the radius r are related by the angle θ. We can express the height h in terms of the angle θ and the slant height L as follows:\n\nh = L * cos(θ) = (4 / sin(θ)) * cos(θ)\n\nSimilarly, we can express the radius r in terms of the angle θ and the slant height L as follows:\n\nr = L * sin(θ) = (4 / sin(θ)) * sin(θ)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for h and r in the volume formula:\n\nV(θ) = (1/3)π[(4 / sin(θ)) * sin(θ)]^2 * [(4 / sin(θ)) * cos(θ)]\n\nV(θ) = (1/3)π * (4^2) * cos(θ)\n\nTo find the angle θ that maximizes the volume, we need to find the critical points of the volume function V(θ). We do this by taking the derivative of V(θ) with respect to θ and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndV(θ)/dθ = (1/3)π * (4^2) * (-sin(θ))\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for θ:\n\n0 = (1/3)π * (4^2) * (-sin(θ))\n\n0 = -sin(θ)\n\nsin(θ) = 0\n\nThe sine function is equal to 0 at θ = 0 and θ = π. However, θ = 0 corresponds to a degenerate cone with no volume, and θ = π corresponds to a flat cone with no height. Therefore, we need to consider the local maximum of the volume function, which occurs at the angle θ where the second derivative of the volume function is negative.\n\nLet's find the second derivative of the volume function:\n\nd^2V(θ)/dθ^2 = (1/3)π * (4^2) * (-cos(θ))\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical point θ = π:\n\nd^2V(π)/dθ^2 = (1/3)π * (4^2) * (-cos(π)) = (1/3)π * (4^2) * 1 > 0\n\nSince the second derivative is positive at the critical point θ = π, this corresponds to a local minimum of the volume function. Therefore, the angle of elevation that results in the maximum volume of the tank is θ = π."
