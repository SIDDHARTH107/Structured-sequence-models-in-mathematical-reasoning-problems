    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and two bases that measure 6 cm and 10 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 8 cm, and the two bases are 6 cm and 10 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (6 + 10) * 8\n\nArea = (1/2) * (16) * 8\n\nArea = 8 * 8\n\nArea = 64 square centimeters\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 64 square centimeters."
