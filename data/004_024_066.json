    "message_2": "To find dy/dx, we need to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x. \n\nDifferentiating x^2y with respect to x, we get:\nd(x^2y)/dx = 2xy + x^2(dy/dx)\n\nDifferentiating xy^3 with respect to x, we get:\nd(xy^3)/dx = y^3 + 3x(y^2)(dy/dx)\n\nNow, differentiate the whole equation with respect to x:\n2xy + x^2(dy/dx) + y^3 + 3x(y^2)(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find dy/dx when x = 1. To do this, we first need to find the corresponding value of y when x = 1. Substitute x = 1 into the original equation:\n\n1^2 * y + 1 * y^3 = 10\ny + y^3 = 10\n\nThis equation has multiple solutions for y, but we will consider the real solution y ≈ 1.857. \n\nNow, substitute x = 1 and y ≈ 1.857 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(1)(1.857) + 1^2(dy/dx) + (1.857)^3 + 3(1)((1.857)^2)(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSolve for dy/dx:\n\n3.714 + dy/dx + 6.407 + 6.48(dy/dx) = 0\n7.121(dy/dx) = -10.121\ndy/dx ≈ -1.421\n\nSo, when x = 1, dy/dx ≈ -1.421."
