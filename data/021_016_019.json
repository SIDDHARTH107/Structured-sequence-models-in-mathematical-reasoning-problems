    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Define the number of ants (n), the interval for x ([0, 4]), and the initial pheromone values (τ) for each position in the interval. Also, set the evaporation rate (ρ) and the number of iterations (T).\n\n2. Ants' movement: Each ant will move from its current position to a new position based on the probability distribution determined by the pheromone values and the heuristic information (η) related to the function f(x).\n\n3. Pheromone update: After all ants have moved, update the pheromone values based on the quality of the solutions found by the ants.\n\n4. Termination: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for T iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nFor this problem, we will not implement the full ACO algorithm but will provide an outline of how it can be applied to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x + 7 in the interval [0, 4].\n\n1. Initialization:\n   - n = 10 (for example)\n   - Interval for x: [0, 4]\n   - Initial pheromone values: τ(x) = 1 for all x in [0, 4]\n   - Evaporation rate: ρ = 0.1\n   - Number of iterations: T = 100\n\n2. Ants' movement:\n   - For each ant, choose a new position x' based on the probability distribution determined by the pheromone values and the heuristic information (η). The heuristic information can be the inverse of the function value (1/f(x)) or the negative of the function value (-f(x)).\n   - Update the position of each ant.\n\n3. Pheromone update:\n   - For each position x in the interval [0, 4], update the pheromone value τ(x) based on the quality of the solutions found by the ants:\n     τ(x) = (1 - ρ) * τ(x) + Δτ(x)\n     where Δτ(x) is the sum of the pheromone contributions of all ants that visited position x in the current iteration.\n\n4. Termination:\n   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 for T iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the minimum value does not change significantly for a certain number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the ACO algorithm, the position x with the highest pheromone value will be the approximate solution for the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x + 7 in the interval [0, 4]. Note that the ACO algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution found may not be the exact minimum value."
