    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to minimize the cost of producing two products, P1 and P2. The production process involves three machines, M1, M2, and M3. The processing times for each product on each machine are given in the following table. \n\n|      | Machine M1 | Machine M2 | Machine M3 |\n|------|------------|------------|------------|\n| P1   | 2          | 4          | 1          |\n| P2   | 3          | 1          | 2          |\n\nThe total processing time available per day on each machine is 8 hours for M1, 10 hours for M2, and 6 hours for M3. The unit production cost for P1 and P2 are $10 and $20, respectively. What is the minimum cost of producing 10 units of P1 and 20 units of P2 per day?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of producing 10 units of P1 and 20 units of P2 per day, we first need to determine if it is possible to produce the required number of units within the available machine hours.\n\nLet x be the number of P1 units produced and y be the number of P2 units produced. The constraints for the available machine hours are:\n\nMachine M1: 2x + 3y ≤ 8\nMachine M2: 4x + y ≤ 10\nMachine M3: x + 2y ≤ 6\n\nWe want to produce at least 10 units of P1 and 20 units of P2, so we have the additional constraints:\n\nx ≥ 10\ny ≥ 20\n\nNow we need to find the minimum cost, which is given by the objective function:\n\nCost = 10x + 20y\n\nWe can use linear programming to solve this problem. The feasible region is determined by the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 8\n4x + y ≤ 10\nx + 2y ≤ 6\nx ≥ 10\ny ≥ 20\n\nPlotting these constraints on a graph and finding the feasible region, we can determine the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nA (10, 20)\nB (10, 22/3)\nC (2, 2)\n\nNow we can evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nCost(A) = 10(10) + 20(20) = 100 + 400 = 500\nCost(B) = 10(10) + 20(22/3) = 100 + 440 = 540\nCost(C) = 10(2) + 20(2) = 20 + 40 = 60\n\nThe minimum cost occurs at vertex A, with a cost of $500. Therefore, the minimum cost of producing 10 units of P1 and 20 units of P2 per day is $500."
