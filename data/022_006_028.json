    "message_2": "We are given the function $f(z) = \\frac{z}{(z-2)}$ and the domain $D = \\{z: |z| < 3\\}$. We want to find the point $z_0$ on the boundary of the domain $D$ (i.e., $|z_0| = 3$) where the modulus of the function attains its minimum value.\n\nFirst, let's find $|f(0)|$:\n\n$$|f(0)| = \\left|\\frac{0}{(0-2)}\\right| = \\frac{0}{2} = 0$$\n\nNow, let's use the minimum modulus principle. The minimum modulus principle states that if $f$ is a non-constant holomorphic function on a domain $D$, then the minimum of $|f(z)|$ on $D$ is attained on the boundary of $D$. Since $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $D$, we have:\n\n$$|f(z_0)| \\geq |f(0)| = 0$$\n\nfor any $z_0 \\in \\partial D$. Now, we want to find the point $z_0$ at which equality holds. To do this, let's consider the function $g(z) = \\frac{1}{f(z)} = \\frac{z-2}{z}$. We have:\n\n$$|g(z_0)| = \\frac{1}{|f(z_0)|} \\leq \\frac{1}{|f(0)|} = \\infty$$\n\nSince $g(z)$ is also holomorphic on $D$, the maximum modulus principle applies, which states that the maximum of $|g(z)|$ on $D$ is attained on the boundary of $D$. Therefore, there exists a point $z_0 \\in \\partial D$ such that:\n\n$$|g(z_0)| = \\max_{z \\in \\partial D} |g(z)|$$\n\nNow, let's find the point $z_0$ on the boundary of $D$ (i.e., $|z_0| = 3$) where the modulus of $g(z)$ attains its maximum value. We have:\n\n$$|g(z_0)| = \\left|\\frac{z_0 - 2}{z_0}\\right| = \\frac{|z_0 - 2|}{|z_0|}$$\n\nSince $|z_0| = 3$, we can write $z_0 = 3e^{i\\theta}$ for some $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. Then:\n\n$$|g(z_0)| = \\frac{|3e^{i\\theta} - 2|}{|3e^{i\\theta}|} = \\frac{|3e^{i\\theta} - 2|}{3}$$\n\nTo maximize $|g(z_0)|$, we need to minimize $|3e^{i\\theta} - 2|$. By the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n$$|3e^{i\\theta} - 2| \\geq |3 - 2| = 1$$\n\nEquality holds when $3e^{i\\theta} - 2$ is a positive real number. This occurs when $\\theta = 0$. Therefore, the point $z_0$ at which the modulus of $f(z)$ attains its minimum value is:\n\n$$z_0 = 3e^{i\\cdot 0} = 3$$"
