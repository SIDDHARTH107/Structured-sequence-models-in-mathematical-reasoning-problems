    "message_2": "1. In classical logic, P is false. A natural number is even if it is divisible by 2, and odd if it is not divisible by 2. No natural number can be both even and odd at the same time, as it would contradict the definitions of even and odd numbers.\n\n2. In intuitionistic logic, P is also false. Intuitionistic logic is a constructive logic, which means that to prove the existence of an object, one must provide a construction or example of that object. Since there is no natural number that is both even and odd, we cannot construct such a number, and therefore, the proposition P is false in intuitionistic logic as well."
