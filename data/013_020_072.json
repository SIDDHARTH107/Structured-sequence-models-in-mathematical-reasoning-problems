    "message_1": "In a Beauty Contest game, there are 10 contestants who must choose a number between 0 and 100. The goal is to choose the number that is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the numbers chosen. What number should each contestant choose to maximize their chances of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that all the contestants are rational and will try to maximize their chances of winning. Let x be the average of all the numbers chosen by the contestants. Then, the target number to choose is (2/3)x.\n\nIf all contestants think that everyone will choose a number between 0 and 100, they will assume the average x to be 50. In this case, the target number would be (2/3)(50) = 100/3 ≈ 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all contestants think that everyone will choose a number around 33.33, the average x will be lower. Let's assume the new average is 33.33, then the new target number would be (2/3)(33.33) ≈ 22.22.\n\nThis process of iteratively adjusting the target number can continue, with each iteration assuming that all contestants will choose a number closer to the previous target. This is known as the \"iterated elimination of dominated strategies\" in game theory.\n\nAs the iterations continue, the target number will approach a value close to 0. In practice, the optimal number to choose would be a small positive number, as choosing 0 would not be rational since it would not maximize the chances of winning.\n\nHowever, since the game involves human psychology and not all contestants may be rational or follow the same thought process, there is no definitive answer to the optimal number to choose. It would be best to choose a number slightly above 0, taking into account the possibility that some contestants may not follow the iterated elimination of dominated strategies."
