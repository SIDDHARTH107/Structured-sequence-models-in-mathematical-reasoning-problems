Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of Control theory and optimal control problems:\n\nConsider a simple circuit consisting of a capacitor C and a resistor R connected in series. The voltage across the capacitor at any time t is given by V(t), where V(0) = 0. The current flowing through the circuit is given by I(t) = C(dV/dt) + V/R.\n\nSuppose we want to control the current flowing through the circuit to follow a desired current function given by I_d(t) = 2sin(t) + 1. We can control the circuit by choosing the voltage across the capacitor, V(t), at each time t. However, the voltage cannot exceed a maximum value of V_max = 5.\n\nFind the optimal voltage function V(t) that minimizes the following cost function:\n\nJ(V) = ∫[I(t) - I_d(t)]^2 dt     from t=0 to T\n\nwhere T is the final time and I_d(t) is the desired current function.\n \nFind the optimal voltage function for T=10 seconds, given that R = 1 ohm, C = 1 farad.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the calculus of variations and the Euler-Lagrange equation. Let's first rewrite the cost function J(V) as:\n\nJ(V) = ∫[C(dV/dt) + V/R - I_d(t)]^2 dt     from t=0 to T\n\nNow, let's define the Lagrangian L as:\n\nL = [C(dV/dt) + V/R - I_d(t)]^2\n\nWe want to minimize J(V) by finding the optimal voltage function V(t) that satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dV/dt)) - ∂L/∂V = 0\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂L/∂(dV/dt) = 2[C(dV/dt) + V/R - I_d(t)] * C\n∂L/∂V = 2[C(dV/dt) + V/R - I_d(t)] * (1/R)\n\nNow, let's compute the time derivative of ∂L/∂(dV/dt):\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dV/dt)) = 2[C(d²V/dt²) + (1/R)(dV/dt)] * C\n\nNow, we can plug these derivatives into the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\n2[C(d²V/dt²) + (1/R)(dV/dt)] * C - 2[C(dV/dt) + V/R - I_d(t)] * (1/R) = 0\n\nSince R = 1 ohm and C = 1 farad, we can simplify the equation:\n\n2(d²V/dt² + dV/dt) - 2(dV/dt + V - I_d(t)) = 0\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nd²V/dt² - dV/dt + V = I_d(t)\n\nThis is a second-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation with a forcing function I_d(t) = 2sin(t) + 1. To solve this equation, we will first find the complementary solution V_c(t) by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\nd²V_c/dt² - dV_c/dt + V_c = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\nr² - r + 1 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get two complex roots: r = 1/2 ± i√3/2. Therefore, the complementary solution is:\n\nV_c(t) = e^(t/2) * [A * cos(√3 * t / 2) + B * sin(√3 * t / 2)]\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution V_p(t) for the inhomogeneous equation. Since the forcing function is a linear combination of sin(t) and cos(t), we can assume a particular solution of the form:\n\nV_p(t) = C * sin(t) + D * cos(t)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives of V_p(t) and plugging them into the inhomogeneous equation, we can solve for the constants C and D:\n\nC = 5/2\nD = -1/2\n\nThus, the particular solution is:\n\nV_p(t) = (5/2) * sin(t) - (1/2) * cos(t)\n\nNow, we can find the general solution V(t) by adding the complementary and particular solutions:\n\nV(t) = e^(t/2) * [A * cos(√3 * t / 2) + B * sin(√3 * t / 2)] + (5/2) * sin(t) - (1/2) * cos(t)\n\nTo find the optimal voltage function, we need to determine the constants A and B using the initial conditions V(0) = 0 and the constraint that V(t) cannot exceed V_max = 5. However, finding the exact values of A and B requires more information about the system, such as additional boundary conditions or constraints. Without this information, we cannot determine the unique optimal voltage function."
