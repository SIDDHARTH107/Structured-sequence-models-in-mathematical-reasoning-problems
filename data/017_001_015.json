The multiplication table for this group will be a 4x4 table, where the rows and columns are indexed by the elements of the group, and the entry in the i-th row and j-th column is the product of the i-th and j-th elements.\n\nMultiplication table:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  c\n---+----------\n e | e  a  b  c\n a | a  ?  ?  ?\n b | b  ?  ?  ?\n c | c  ?  ?  ?\n```\n\nWe need to fill in the missing entries in the table. We know that the group must satisfy the group axioms:\n\n1. Closure: The product of any two elements in the group must also be in the group.\n2. Associativity: (ab)c = a(bc) for all a, b, c in the group.\n3. Identity: There exists an element e in the group such that ae = ea = a for all a in the group.\n4. Inverse: For each element a in the group, there exists an element a' such that aa' = a'a = e.\n\nWe already have the identity element e in our table. Now let's try to fill in the rest of the table while satisfying the group axioms.\n\nCase 1: Cyclic group C4\n\nIn a cyclic group of order 4, there is a generator element, say a, such that the group elements can be written as {e, a, a^2, a^3}. In this case, the multiplication table would look like:\n\n```\n   | e  a  a^2  a^3\n---+--------------\n e | e  a  a^2  a^3\n a | a a^2 a^3   e\na^2|a^2a^3  e    a\na^3|a^3  e  a  a^2\n```\n\nCase 2: Klein four-group V4\n\nIn the Klein four-group, every non-identity element has order 2, meaning that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. In this case, the multiplication table would look like:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  c\n---+----------\n e | e  a  b  c\n a | a  e  c  b\n b | b  c  e  a\n c | c  b  a  e\n```\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these two cases is the correct one for our group. To do this, we can check the properties of the group elements.\n\nIn the cyclic group C4, there is only one element of order 2 (a^2). In the Klein four-group V4, there are three elements of order 2 (a, b, and c). So, we can check the order of the elements in our group to determine which case it is.\n\nIf our group has only one element of order 2, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4. If our group has three elements of order 2, it is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
