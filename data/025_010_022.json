    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space H^0(X,L), we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem for a smooth projective curve X of genus g with a line bundle L of degree d is given by:\n\nh^0(X,L) - h^1(X,L) = d - g + 1\n\nHere, h^0(X,L) is the dimension of the space of global sections of L, and h^1(X,L) is the dimension of the space of first cohomology of L.\n\nIn our case, we have a curve X of genus g = 3 and a line bundle L of degree d = 5. Plugging these values into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\nh^0(X,L) - h^1(X,L) = 5 - 3 + 1 = 3\n\nNow, we need to find h^1(X,L). To do this, we will use the Serre duality theorem, which states that for a smooth projective curve X of genus g and a line bundle L on X, we have:\n\nh^1(X,L) = h^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1))\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical bundle on X. The canonical bundle K_X has degree 2g - 2, so in our case, it has degree 2(3) - 2 = 4.\n\nNow, we need to compute the degree of the line bundle K_X ⊗ L^(-1). Since L has degree 5, L^(-1) has degree -5. Therefore, the degree of K_X ⊗ L^(-1) is:\n\ndeg(K_X ⊗ L^(-1)) = deg(K_X) + deg(L^(-1)) = 4 + (-5) = -1\n\nSince the degree of K_X ⊗ L^(-1) is negative, there are no global sections, so h^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1)) = 0. By Serre duality, we have h^1(X,L) = 0.\n\nFinally, plugging this value back into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\nh^0(X,L) - 0 = 3\n\nSo, the dimension of the vector space H^0(X,L) is 3."
