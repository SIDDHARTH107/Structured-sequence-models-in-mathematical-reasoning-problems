    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S by the map:\n\nΦ(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nThen, the tangent vectors are given by:\n\nΦ_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nΦ_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, let's compute the first fundamental form (the metric tensor):\n\nE = <Φ_u, Φ_u> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <Φ_u, Φ_v> = 4uv\nG = <Φ_v, Φ_v> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we need to compute the second fundamental form (the shape operator):\n\nΦ_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nΦ_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nΦ_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <Φ_uu, N> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = <Φ_uv, N> = 0\nN = <Φ_vv, N> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2) = 1/3\nM = 0\nN = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2) = 1/3\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (1/9 - 0) / (25 - 16) = 1/9\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / (2(EG - F^2)) = (5/3 + 5/3 - 0) / (2(9)) = 5/9\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1, 2) is given by the Gaussian curvature K, which is 1/9."
