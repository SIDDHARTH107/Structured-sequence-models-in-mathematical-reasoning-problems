    "message_2": "We know that sin²x + cos²x = 1 (Pythagorean identity). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1 - tan²x = 1\n\nNow, subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-tan²x = 0\n\nSince tan²x is non-negative, the only way for -tan²x to be equal to 0 is if tan²x = 0. Therefore:\n\ntan²x = 0\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\ntanx = 0\n\nThe tangent function is 0 when x is an integer multiple of π:\n\nx = nπ, where n is an integer."
