    "message_1": "Suppose you are managing a factory that produces two types of products P1 and P2. The profit per unit of P1 and P2 is 20$ and 30$ respectively. The cost to produce one unit of P1 and P2 is 5$ and 10$ respectively. The factory can produce a total of 500 units of products each day. Moreover, there is a demand of at least 150 units of P1 and at least 100 units of P2 each day. Determine the optimal number of units of P1 and P2 to be produced such that the total profit is maximized using the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm.",
    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. In this case, we want to maximize the total profit by determining the optimal number of units of P1 and P2 to be produced.\n\nTo apply the ABC algorithm, we need to define the following components:\n\n1. Objective function: The objective function represents the total profit, which we want to maximize. The profit per unit of P1 is 20 - 5 = 15$, and the profit per unit of P2 is 30 - 10 = 20$. Therefore, the objective function is F(x) = 15 * P1 + 20 * P2.\n\n2. Constraints: The factory can produce a total of 500 units of products each day (P1 + P2 <= 500), and there is a demand of at least 150 units of P1 (P1 >= 150) and at least 100 units of P2 (P2 >= 100) each day.\n\n3. Parameters: The number of employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees, as well as the maximum number of iterations, should be set according to the problem's complexity and size.\n\nNow, let's apply the ABC algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the search space, considering the constraints.\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the objective function.\n\n3. For each employed bee, search for a new solution in the neighborhood of the current solution, and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the current solution with the new one.\n\n4. Calculate the probability of selecting each solution by the onlooker bees based on their fitness.\n\n5. For each onlooker bee, select a solution based on the calculated probabilities, search for a new solution in the neighborhood of the selected solution, and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the selected solution with the new one.\n\n6. If there is any abandoned solution (not improved for a certain number of iterations), replace it with a new randomly generated solution (scout bee).\n\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the optimal solution is found.\n\nAfter applying the ABC algorithm, we will obtain the optimal number of units of P1 and P2 to be produced such that the total profit is maximized. Note that the actual implementation of the algorithm requires programming skills and appropriate software tools."
