    "message_2": "The given sequence is a geometric sequence, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor. In this case, the constant factor is 2.\n\n2 × 2 = 4\n4 × 2 = 8\n8 × 2 = 16\n\nTo find the next term, multiply the last term (16) by the constant factor (2):\n\n16 × 2 = 32\n\nSo, the next term in the sequence is 32."
