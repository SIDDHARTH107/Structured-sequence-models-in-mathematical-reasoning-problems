    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is in degrees.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nArc length = (45 / 360) × 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/8) × 16π\nArc length = 2π cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = 2π + 2(8)\nPerimeter = 2π + 16\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is 2π + 16 cm."
