    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process of a certain type of product, the probability of a defect occurring is 0.03. If the company produces 5000 units of the product, what is the expected number of defective units?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of defective units, we can multiply the total number of units produced by the probability of a defect occurring:\n\nExpected number of defective units = (Total number of units) × (Probability of a defect)\n= 5000 × 0.03\n= 150\n\nSo, the expected number of defective units is 150."
