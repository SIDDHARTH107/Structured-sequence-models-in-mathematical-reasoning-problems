    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 4 heads and 6 tails in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads)\n- n is the total number of trials (coin flips)\n- k is the number of successes (heads)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is equal to 1 - p\n\nIn this problem, n = 10, k = 4, p = 0.5 (since it's a fair coin), and q = 1 - p = 0.5.\n\nFirst, we need to find nCk, which is the number of ways to choose 4 heads out of 10 coin flips:\n\nnCk = C(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * (10 - 4)!)\n= 10! / (4! * 6!)\n= (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 210\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = (210) * (0.5^4) * (0.5^6)\n= 210 * 0.000244140625 * 0.015625\n= 210 * 0.003814697265625\n= 0.8017578125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 4 heads and 6 tails in 10 coin flips is approximately 0.8018 or 80.18%."
