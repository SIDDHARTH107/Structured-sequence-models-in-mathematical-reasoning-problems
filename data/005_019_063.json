    "message_1": "Suppose that on any given day, 70% of the people who visit a particular cafe order a cappuccino, while the remaining 30% order an espresso. If someone orders a cappuccino on a given day, there is a 60% chance that they will order a cappuccino again the next day. On the other hand, if someone orders an espresso on a given day, there is a 40% chance that they will order a cappuccino the next day.\n\nIf there are currently 100 people in the cafe, how many cappuccinos and espressos do we expect to be ordered in two days?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem into two days and calculate the expected number of cappuccinos and espressos ordered on each day.\n\nDay 1:\n- 70% of 100 people order a cappuccino: 0.7 * 100 = 70 cappuccinos\n- 30% of 100 people order an espresso: 0.3 * 100 = 30 espressos\n\nDay 2:\n- 60% of the 70 cappuccino drinkers from Day 1 order a cappuccino again: 0.6 * 70 = 42 cappuccinos\n- 40% of the 30 espresso drinkers from Day 1 order a cappuccino: 0.4 * 30 = 12 cappuccinos\n- Total cappuccinos on Day 2: 42 + 12 = 54 cappuccinos\n\n- 40% of the 70 cappuccino drinkers from Day 1 order an espresso: 0.4 * 70 = 28 espressos\n- 60% of the 30 espresso drinkers from Day 1 order an espresso again: 0.6 * 30 = 18 espressos\n- Total espressos on Day 2: 28 + 18 = 46 espressos\n\nIn two days:\n- Total cappuccinos: 70 (Day 1) + 54 (Day 2) = 124 cappuccinos\n- Total espressos: 30 (Day 1) + 46 (Day 2) = 76 espressos\n\nSo, we expect 124 cappuccinos and 76 espressos to be ordered in two days."
