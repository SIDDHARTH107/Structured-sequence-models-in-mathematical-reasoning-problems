    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical optimization problem for a math student to solve using tabu search:\n\nThe management of a manufacturing company needs to determine the optimal production levels of two products, A and B, to maximize the total profit subject to the following constraints:\n\n- Product A requires 3 units of labor and 2 units of raw material per unit produced\n- Product B requires 2 units of labor and 4 units of raw material per unit produced\n- There are 500 units of labor and 600 units of raw material available for production\n- The company can sell a maximum of 100 units of product A and 200 units of product B\n\nThe profit per unit for product A is $10 and for product B is $15. Use tabu search to determine the optimal production levels of products A and B that maximize the total profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the search parameters:\n   - Tabu list size: 10\n   - Number of iterations: 100\n   - Neighborhood size: 5\n\n2. Define the objective function (total profit) and constraints:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 10A + 15B\n\nConstraints:\n- 3A + 2B ≤ 500 (labor constraint)\n- 2A + 4B ≤ 600 (raw material constraint)\n- 0 ≤ A ≤ 100 (product A constraint)\n- 0 ≤ B ≤ 200 (product B constraint)\n\n3. Generate an initial solution (A, B) randomly within the feasible region.\n\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Generate a set of neighboring solutions within the feasible region.\n   b. Select the best solution from the neighbors that is not in the tabu list.\n   c. Update the tabu list by adding the selected solution and removing the oldest one if the list is full.\n   d. Update the best solution found so far if the selected solution has a higher profit.\n\n5. After completing all iterations, return the best solution found.\n\nApplying the tabu search algorithm with the given parameters, we can find the optimal production levels of products A and B that maximize the total profit. The optimal solution may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm, but it should be close to the following values:\n\nA = 100 units\nB = 100 units\n\nTotal profit: P = 10(100) + 15(100) = $2,500."
