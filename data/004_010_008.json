    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 4x² - 6x + 7, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nThe antiderivative F(x) is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(4x² - 6x + 7) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\nF(x) = ∫(4x²) dx - ∫(6x) dx + ∫(7) dx\n\nNow, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that ∫(x^n) dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nF(x) = (4x^(2+1))/(2+1) - (6x^(1+1))/(1+1) + 7x + C\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nF(x) = (4x^3)/3 - (6x^2)/2 + 7x + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 4x² - 6x + 7 is:\n\nF(x) = (4/3)x^3 - 3x^2 + 7x + C"
