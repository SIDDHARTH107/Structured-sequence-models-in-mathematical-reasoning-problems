    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The company has a total of 50 units of raw material available for production. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of raw material and each unit of product B requires 3 units of raw material. The company has a market demand of at least 10 units of product A and at least 15 units of product B. The profit of each unit of product A is $5 and the profit of each unit of product B is $6. What is the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 50\n2. Market demand constraint for product A: x ≥ 10\n3. Market demand constraint for product B: y ≥ 15\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 5x + 6y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies all the constraints.\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 50\n   y ≤ (50 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. x ≥ 10\n\n3. y ≥ 15\n\nNow, we need to find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nA. Intersection of x = 10 and y = 15: (10, 15)\nB. Intersection of x = 10 and 2x + 3y = 50: (10, (50 - 2*10) / 3) = (10, 10)\nC. Intersection of y = 15 and 2x + 3y = 50: (50 - 3*15) / 2 = 5, (5, 15)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function (profit) at each corner point:\n\nA. P(10, 15) = 5*10 + 6*15 = 50 + 90 = $140\nB. P(10, 10) = 5*10 + 6*10 = 50 + 60 = $110\nC. P(5, 15) = 5*5 + 6*15 = 25 + 90 = $115\n\nThe maximum profit is $140, which occurs at the production plan (10, 15). Therefore, the company should produce 10 units of product A and 15 units of product B to maximize its profit."
