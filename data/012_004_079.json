    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, ensuring that adding the edge does not create a cycle in the tree.\n4. Continue adding edges until the minimum spanning tree includes all the vertices.\n\nSorted edges by weight:\n1. BD: 1\n2. CE: 1\n3. HI: 1\n4. AB: 2\n5. GH: 2\n6. AC: 3\n7. AD: 3\n8. HJ: 3\n9. IJ: 3\n10. BE: 4\n11. DE: 5\n12. FG: 6\n13. EF: 7\n\nNow, let's build the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add edge BD (weight 1)\n2. Add edge CE (weight 1)\n3. Add edge HI (weight 1)\n4. Add edge AB (weight 2)\n5. Add edge GH (weight 2)\n6. Add edge AC (weight 3) - skip, as it would create a cycle (A-B-C-A)\n7. Add edge AD (weight 3)\n8. Add edge HJ (weight 3)\n9. Add edge IJ (weight 3) - skip, as it would create a cycle (H-I-J-H)\n10. Add edge BE (weight 4) - skip, as it would create a cycle (A-B-E-C-A)\n11. Add edge DE (weight 5) - skip, as it would create a cycle (A-D-E-C-A)\n12. Add edge FG (weight 6)\n13. Add edge EF (weight 7) - skip, as it would create a cycle (E-F-G-H-I-E)\n\nThe minimum spanning tree includes the following edges:\n- BD (weight 1)\n- CE (weight 1)\n- HI (weight 1)\n- AB (weight 2)\n- GH (weight 2)\n- AD (weight 3)\n- HJ (weight 3)\n- FG (weight 6)\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 19."
