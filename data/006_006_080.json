    "message_2": "To find the probability of the basketball player making exactly 4 out of 5 free throw shots, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x!(n-x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of making exactly x successful shots\n- n is the total number of shots (in this case, 5)\n- x is the number of successful shots (in this case, 4)\n- p is the probability of making a successful shot (in this case, 0.8)\n- q is the probability of missing a shot (in this case, 1 - p = 0.2)\n- ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(4) = (5! / (4!(5-4)!)) * (0.8^4) * (0.2^(5-4))\n\nFirst, we calculate the factorials:\n\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n(5-4)! = 1! = 1\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(4) = (120 / (24 * 1)) * (0.8^4) * (0.2^1)\n\nNext, we calculate the powers:\n\n0.8^4 = 0.4096\n0.2^1 = 0.2\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(4) = (120 / 24) * 0.4096 * 0.2\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(4) = 5 * 0.4096 * 0.2 = 0.4096\n\nThe probability that the basketball player will make exactly 4 out of 5 free throw shots in their next game is approximately 40.96%."
