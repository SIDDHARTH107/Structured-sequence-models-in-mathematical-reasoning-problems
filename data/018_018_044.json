    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it consists of elements that are unique to each set.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nB = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is commutative. The symmetric difference is commutative if A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSince A Δ B = B Δ A, the symmetric difference is commutative."
