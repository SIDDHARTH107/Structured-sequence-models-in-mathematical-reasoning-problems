    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that a certain brand of batteries lasts an average of 50 hours in a particular electronic device, with a standard deviation of 5 hours. A consumer advocacy group suspects that the batteries actually last less than 50 hours on average. To test this claim, a random sample of 36 batteries is selected and tested in the electronic device, yielding a sample mean battery life of 48 hours. \n\nQuestion for the math student to solve: Based on this sample data, can we reject the manufacturer's claim and conclude with 95% confidence that the average battery life is less than 50 hours?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average battery life is equal to 50 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average battery life is less than 50 hours.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score for the sample data. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (48 - 50) / (5 / sqrt(36))\n\nt = (-2) / (5 / 6)\n\nt = -2 / (5/6)\n\nt = -2 * (6/5)\n\nt = -12/5\n\nt = -2.4\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with 95% confidence and 35 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the critical t-value is approximately -1.69.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-2.4) is less than the critical t-value (-1.69), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude with 95% confidence that the average battery life is less than 50 hours."
