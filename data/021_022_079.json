The production cost is modeled by the function \n\nC(x)= 100+10x+0.1x^2\n\nwhere x is the number of units produced. Using firefly algorithm, determine the minimum cost of production and the optimal number of units to be produced.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is based on the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that can be used to find the optimal solution to a problem. In this case, we want to find the minimum cost of production and the optimal number of units to be produced.\n\nTo apply the Firefly Algorithm to this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies (solutions) with random positions (x values) within the search space.\n2. Define the attractiveness of each firefly based on the objective function value (C(x)).\n3. Update the positions of the fireflies based on their attractiveness and the distance between them.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy).\n\nHowever, as a mathematician, I can provide you with a more straightforward method to find the minimum cost of production and the optimal number of units to be produced by using calculus.\n\nTo find the minimum cost, we can take the first derivative of the cost function C(x) and set it equal to zero:\n\nC'(x) = dC(x)/dx = 10 + 0.2x\n\nNow, set C'(x) to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 10 + 0.2x\nx = -10 / 0.2\nx = -50\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of units produced, we need to find the critical points of the function. To do this, we can take the second derivative of the cost function:\n\nC''(x) = d²C(x)/dx² = 0.2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, the function is concave up, and there is a minimum at x = 0. Therefore, the optimal number of units to be produced is 0, and the minimum cost of production is:\n\nC(0) = 100 + 10(0) + 0.1(0)^2\nC(0) = 100\n\nSo, the minimum cost of production is $100, and the optimal number of units to be produced is 0."
