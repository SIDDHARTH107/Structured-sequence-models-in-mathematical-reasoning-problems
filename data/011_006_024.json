    "message_1": "Suppose you have 6 identical balls and 2 identical boxes labeled A and B. How many ways are there to distribute the balls between the two boxes if box A can contain at most 4 balls? Use generating functions to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to find the generating functions for each box. \n\nLet's denote the generating function for box A as A(x) and for box B as B(x). Since box A can contain at most 4 balls, the generating function for box A is:\n\nA(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4\n\nThe 1 represents the case when there are no balls in box A, x represents the case when there is 1 ball, x^2 represents the case when there are 2 balls, and so on.\n\nNow, let's find the generating function for box B. Since there are 6 balls in total and box A can contain at most 4 balls, box B can contain anywhere from 0 to 6 balls. Therefore, the generating function for box B is:\n\nB(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6\n\nNow, we need to find the generating function for the distribution of balls between the two boxes. We can do this by multiplying the generating functions for box A and box B:\n\nC(x) = A(x) * B(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4) * (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of x^6 in the resulting polynomial, as this will give us the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls between the two boxes.\n\nC(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4) * (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)\n     = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 + 6x^5 + 7x^6 + 6x^7 + 5x^8 + 4x^9 + 3x^10 + 2x^11 + x^12\n\nThe coefficient of x^6 in C(x) is 7. Therefore, there are 7 ways to distribute the 6 balls between the two boxes with box A containing at most 4 balls."
