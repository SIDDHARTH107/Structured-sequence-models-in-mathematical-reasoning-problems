    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to find the production level (q) that maximizes the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue function (R(q)) and the cost function (C(q)).\n\nFirst, let's find the revenue function. Revenue is the product of the price (P(q)) and the quantity (q):\n\nR(q) = P(q) * q = (500 - 0.5q) * q = 500q - 0.5q^2\n\nNow, let's find the profit function by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function:\n\nProfit(q) = R(q) - C(q) = (500q - 0.5q^2) - (5000 + 50q + 0.1q^2)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nProfit(q) = -0.6q^2 + 450q - 5000\n\nTo find the optimal production level, we need to find the maximum point of the profit function. To do this, we can take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dq = -1.2q + 450 = 0\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq = 450 / 1.2 = 375\n\nSo, the optimal production level to maximize the company's profit is 375 units."
