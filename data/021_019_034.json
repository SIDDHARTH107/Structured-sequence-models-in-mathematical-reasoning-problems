Product B uses 2 units of material M1 and 4 units of material M2. If the company has 300 units of M1 and 400 units of M2 available, what is the maximum profit the company can obtain if the profit for each unit of product A is 5 dollars and for each unit of product B is 8 dollars using Harmony Search Algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The Harmony Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. However, this problem can be solved using linear programming since it involves maximizing profit under given constraints.\n\nLet x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize): P = 5x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Material M1: 3x + 2y ≤ 300\n2. Material M2: 2x + 4y ≤ 400\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. For 3x + 2y ≤ 300:\n   y ≤ (300 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. For 2x + 4y ≤ 400:\n   y ≤ (400 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of 3x + 2y = 300 and 2x + 4y = 400:\n   Solving this system of equations, we get x = 60 and y = 70.\n\n2. Intersection of 3x + 2y = 300 and y = 0 (x-axis):\n   Solving this system of equations, we get x = 100 and y = 0.\n\n3. Intersection of 2x + 4y = 400 and x = 0 (y-axis):\n   Solving this system of equations, we get x = 0 and y = 100.\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 8y at each corner point:\n\n1. P(60, 70) = 5(60) + 8(70) = 300 + 560 = 860\n2. P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500\n3. P(0, 100) = 5(0) + 8(100) = 800\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at the point (60, 70), with a profit of 860 dollars. Therefore, the company should produce 60 units of Product A and 70 units of Product B to maximize their profit."
