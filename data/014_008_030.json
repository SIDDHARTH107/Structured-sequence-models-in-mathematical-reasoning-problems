    "message_2": "The number of possible keys for a Block Cipher with a key length of 256 bits can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of possible keys = 2^(key length)\n\nIn this case, the key length is 256 bits, so the number of possible keys is:\n\nNumber of possible keys = 2^256\n\nThe number of possible keys for a Block Cipher using a 128-bit block size and a 256-bit key length is approximately 1.1579209 x 10^77."
