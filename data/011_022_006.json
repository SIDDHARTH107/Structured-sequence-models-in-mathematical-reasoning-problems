    "message_1": "Suppose you have a knapsack with a capacity of 15 kg. You have 6 items, with weights of 4 kg, 6 kg, 3 kg, 2 kg, 5 kg, and 7 kg, and respective values of $100, $150, $50, $30, $90, and $200. What is the maximum value of items you can fit inside the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "This is a classic example of the 0/1 Knapsack problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming. Let's create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained with a given capacity and number of items.\n\nLet's denote the table as dp[i][j], where i is the number of items and j is the capacity of the knapsack. The table will have dimensions (6+1) x (15+1) = 7 x 16, as we need to account for the case when there are no items or when the capacity is 0.\n\nWe will fill the table using the following rules:\n\n1. If there are no items or the capacity is 0, the maximum value is 0: dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 0\n2. If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the remaining capacity, we can choose to either include the item or not. In this case, we will take the maximum value between including the item (value of the item + maximum value for the remaining capacity after including the item) and not including the item (maximum value for the same capacity without the current item): dp[i][j] = max(value[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-weight[i-1]], dp[i-1][j])\n3. If the weight of the current item is greater than the remaining capacity, we cannot include the item, so the maximum value is the same as for the same capacity without the current item: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]\n\nAfter filling the table, the maximum value for the given capacity and number of items will be stored in dp[6][15].\n\nHere's the filled table for the given problem:\n\n```\n   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15\n0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n1  0   0   0   0 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100\n2  0   0   0   0 100 100 150 150 150 150 250 250 250 250 250 250\n3  0   0   0  50 100 100 150 150 200 200 250 250 300 300 300 300\n4  0   0  30  50 100 100 150 150 200 200 250 250 300 300 330 330\n5  0   0  30  50 100  90 150 150 200 200 250 250 300 300 330 390\n6  0   0  30  50 100  90 150 200 200 200 250 290 300 350 350 390\n```\n\nThe maximum value that can be obtained with a capacity of 15 kg and 6 items is $390."
