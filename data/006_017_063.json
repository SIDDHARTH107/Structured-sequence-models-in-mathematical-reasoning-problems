    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one car accident occurring on a particular road within a week, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, car accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (car accidents), k is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...), λ is the average rate of events (0.5 accidents per week in this case), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least one car accident occurring, which is the complement of the probability of no car accidents occurring. In other words:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nUsing the Poisson PMF formula with k = 0 and λ = 0.5:\n\nP(X = 0) = (0.5^0 * e^(-0.5)) / 0! = (1 * e^(-0.5)) / 1 = e^(-0.5)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one car accident:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-0.5)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the value of e^(-0.5):\n\ne^(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653\n\nSo, the probability of at least one car accident occurring within a week is:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - 0.60653 ≈ 0.39347\n\nTherefore, there is approximately a 39.35% chance of at least one car accident occurring on the particular road within a week, based on the historical data provided."
