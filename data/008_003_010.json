We can do this by row reducing the matrix to its row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 times Row 1 from Row 2, and subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 3.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Subtract Row 2 from Row 3.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that there are 2 non-zero rows, which means the rank of matrix A is 2."
