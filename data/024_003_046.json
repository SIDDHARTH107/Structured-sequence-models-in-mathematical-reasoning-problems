    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nS(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the tangent vectors:\n\nSu = dS/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nSv = dS/dv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = Su • Su = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = Su • Sv = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = Sv • Sv = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives:\n\nSuu = d^2S/du^2 = (0, 0, 2)\nSuv = d^2S/dudv = (0, 0, 0)\nSvv = d^2S/dv^2 = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = Suu • N = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\nM = Suv • N = (0, 0, 0) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 0\nN = Svv • N = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\n\nFinally, we find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 2\nM = 0\nN = 2\n\nK = (2*2 - 0^2) / (5*5 - 4^2) = 4 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) is 4/9."
