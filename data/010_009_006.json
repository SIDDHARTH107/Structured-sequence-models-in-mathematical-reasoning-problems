    "message_1": "Suppose you have a closed polygon with 7 sides. How many distinct ways can you triangulate this polygon?",
    "message_2": "To triangulate a polygon with n sides, we can use the Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nFor a polygon with 7 sides (heptagon), we need to find the 5th Catalan number (n-2), since we start counting from a triangle (3 sides) which corresponds to the 1st Catalan number.\n\nC(5) = (1/(5+1)) * (2*5! / (5! * 5!))\nC(5) = (1/6) * (10! / (5! * 5!))\nC(5) = (1/6) * (3628800 / (120 * 120))\nC(5) = (1/6) * (30240)\nC(5) = 5040\n\nSo, there are 5040 distinct ways to triangulate a polygon with 7 sides."
