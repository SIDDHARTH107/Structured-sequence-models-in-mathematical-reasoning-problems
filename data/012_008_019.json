    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is planar or non-planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs and Kuratowski's theorem.\n\nEuler's formula states that for any connected planar graph, the following relationship holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nKuratowski's theorem states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on 5 vertices) or K_3,3 (the complete bipartite graph on 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nIn our case, we have a graph with 10 vertices (V = 10) and 15 edges (E = 15). Let's first use Euler's formula to see if we can determine the planarity of the graph.\n\nV - E + F = 2\n10 - 15 + F = 2\nF = 7\n\nSince F is a positive integer, Euler's formula does not immediately disprove the graph's planarity. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is planar.\n\nNow let's consider Kuratowski's theorem. The graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. The complete graph K_5 has 5 vertices and 10 edges, while the complete bipartite graph K_3,3 has 6 vertices and 9 edges. Since our graph has more vertices and edges than both K_5 and K_3,3, it is possible that it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of either K_5 or K_3,3.\n\nHowever, we can also use the following inequality to check for planarity:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds, which means that the graph could be planar. However, this is not a definitive proof of planarity. To be certain, one would need to examine the specific graph and check for the presence of a K_5 or K_3,3 subgraph.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, it is possible that the graph is planar, but we cannot definitively determine its planarity without examining the specific graph."
