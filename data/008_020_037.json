    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same:\n\n2(x + y + z) = 2(6)\n2x + 2y + 2z = 12\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n2x + 2y + 2z = 12\n2x + y - z = -1\n\nNext, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(2x + 2y + 2z) - (2x + y - z) = 12 - (-1)\n2x - 2x + 2y - y + 2z - (-z) = 13\ny + 3z = 13\n\nNow we have a new equation with only two variables, y and z. We can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 13 - 3z\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y back into either of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:\n\nx + (13 - 3z) + z = 6\nx - 2z = -7\n\nNow we can solve for x in terms of z:\n\nx = -7 + 2z\n\nWe now have expressions for x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = -7 + 2z\ny = 13 - 3z\n\nSince we have only two equations and three variables, we cannot find a unique solution for x, y, and z. The system has infinitely many solutions, and they can be expressed in terms of the free variable z:\n\nx = -7 + 2z\ny = 13 - 3z\nz = z"
