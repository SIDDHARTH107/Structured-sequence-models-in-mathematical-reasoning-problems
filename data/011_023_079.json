    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph with six nodes in such a way that no two adjacent nodes have the same color depends on the structure of the graph. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph (every node is connected to every other node). In this case, the minimum number of colors required is equal to the maximum degree of the nodes plus 1, which for a complete graph with six nodes is 6.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not a complete graph, the minimum number of colors required could be less than 6. For example, if the graph is a cycle with six nodes, the minimum number of colors required is 3 (since it is an even cycle). If the graph is a tree or has a lower degree, the minimum number of colors required could be even less.\n\nSo, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact minimum number of colors required."
