    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter (circumference) of the circular pond, we can use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the pond is 14 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = 3.14159 × 14\n\nC ≈ 43.98226\n\nTherefore, the perimeter (circumference) of the pond is approximately 43.98 meters."
