    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 6z + 13 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 13.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (Δ):\n\nΔ = b^2 - 4ac = 6^2 - 4(1)(13) = 36 - 52 = -16\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we know that there will be two complex solutions.\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-6 ± √(-16)) / 2(1)\n\nz = (-6 ± 4i) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify:\n\nz = -3 ± 2i\n\nSo, the two complex solutions are:\n\nz1 = -3 + 2i\nz2 = -3 - 2i"
