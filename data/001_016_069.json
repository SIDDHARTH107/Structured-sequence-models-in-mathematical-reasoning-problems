    "message_2": "To simplify the given exponential expression, we can use the properties of exponents. Specifically, when multiplying exponential expressions with the same base, we add the exponents, and when dividing, we subtract the exponents.\n\nSo, $2^3 \\times 2^6 \\div 2^2 = 2^{(3+6)} \\div 2^2 = 2^9 \\div 2^2$\n\nNow, we subtract the exponents while dividing:\n\n$2^9 \\div 2^2 = 2^{(9-2)} = 2^7$\n\nThus, the simplified expression is $2^7$."
