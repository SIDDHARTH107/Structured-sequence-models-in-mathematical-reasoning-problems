    "message_2": "To find the height of the kite above the ground, we can use the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is equal to the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle (the height of the kite) to the length of the hypotenuse (the length of the string).\n\nsin(60°) = height / 100\n\nThe sine of 60 degrees is equal to √3/2, so:\n\n(√3/2) = height / 100\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 100 * (√3/2)\n\nheight ≈ 100 * 0.866\n\nheight ≈ 86.6\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the kite above the ground is approximately 87 meters."
