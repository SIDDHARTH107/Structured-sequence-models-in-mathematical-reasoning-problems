    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix, which consists of the partial derivatives of the functions with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 and g(x, y) = x^2 - y. Then the Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y |\n      | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂g/∂x = 2x\n∂g/∂y = -1\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ = | 2x  2y |\n      | 2x  -1 |\n\nNow we can apply Newton's method using the following iterative formula:\n\n(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_n, y_n) - J(x_n, y_n)^(-1) * F(x_n, y_n)\n\nwhere F(x, y) = (f(x, y), g(x, y)) and J(x_n, y_n)^(-1) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at (x_n, y_n).\n\nWe start with the initial guess (x_0, y_0) = (1, 1) and perform 5 iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nJ(1, 1) = | 2  2 |\n              | 2 -1 |\n\nF(1, 1) = (1, 0)\n\nJ(1, 1)^(-1) = | -1/6  1/3 |\n                         |  1/3  1/3 |\n\nJ(1, 1)^(-1) * F(1, 1) = (-1/6, 1/3)\n\n(x_1, y_1) = (1, 1) - (-1/6, 1/3) = (7/6, 2/3)\n\nIteration 2:\nJ(7/6, 2/3) = | 7/3  4/3 |\n                      | 7/3 -1  |\n\nF(7/6, 2/3) = (1/36, 1/36)\n\nJ(7/6, 2/3)^(-1) = | 1/15  2/15 |\n                           |  7/15 -7/15 |\n\nJ(7/6, 2/3)^(-1) * F(7/6, 2/3) = (1/540, -1/540)\n\n(x_2, y_2) = (7/6, 2/3) - (1/540, -1/540) = (1267/1080, 721/1080)\n\nIteration 3:\nJ(1267/1080, 721/1080) ≈ | 2.339  1.335 |\n                                            | 2.339 -1    |\n\nF(1267/1080, 721/1080) ≈ (0.000308, -0.000308)\n\nJ(1267/1080, 721/1080)^(-1) ≈ | -0.392  0.496 |\n                                                 |  0.869 -0.869 |\n\nJ(1267/1080, 721/1080)^(-1) * F(1267/1080, 721/1080) ≈ (0.000153, -0.000153)\n\n(x_3, y_3) ≈ (1267/1080, 721/1080) - (0.000153, -0.000153) ≈ (0.997, 0.498)\n\nIteration 4:\nJ(0.997, 0.498) ≈ | 1.994  0.996 |\n                          | 1.994 -1    |\n\nF(0.997, 0.498) ≈ (0.000002, -0.000002)\n\nJ(0.997, 0.498)^(-1) ≈ | -0.498  0.498 |\n                               |  0.997 -0.997 |\n\nJ(0.997, 0.498)^(-1) * F(0.997, 0.498) ≈ (0.000001, -0.000001)\n\n(x_4, y_4) ≈ (0.997, 0.498) - (0.000001, -0.000001) ≈ (0.997, 0.498)\n\nIteration 5:\nSince the values of x and y have not changed significantly from iteration 4 to iteration 5, we can conclude that the solution has converged.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of nonlinear equations after 5 iterations using Newton's method is approximately (x, y) = (0.997, 0.498), rounded to three decimal places."
