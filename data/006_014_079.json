    "message_2": "To find the probability that the system will fail at least once, we can first find the probability that it will not fail at all in the 8 tests, and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nThe probability of not failing in a single test is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\n\nSince the tests are independent, the probability of not failing in all 8 tests is (0.85)^8.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of failing at least once by subtracting the probability of not failing in all 8 tests from 1:\n\nProbability of failing at least once = 1 - (0.85)^8 â‰ˆ 0.758.\n\nSo, there is approximately a 75.8% chance that the system will fail at least once in the 8 tests."
