    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two products, A and B, which have different production costs and sell for different prices. Product A requires 3 hours of labor and 4 units of raw material, while product B requires 5 hours of labor and 3 units of raw material. The company has 180 hours of labor and 120 units of raw material available for production. Product A sells for $10 per unit and costs $8 to produce, while product B sells for $12 per unit and costs $10 to produce. Using the artificial bee colony algorithm, what is the optimal production plan for the company to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees. However, since I am an AI language model, I cannot execute the ABC algorithm. Instead, I can help you solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 2x + 2y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 5y ≤ 180 (labor constraint)\n4x + 3y ≤ 120 (raw material constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 5y = 180\n   y = (180 - 3x) / 5\n\n2. 4x + 3y = 120\n   y = (120 - 4x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,36), (30,0), and (20,20). We'll now evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0,0) = 2(0) + 2(0) = 0\nP(0,36) = 2(0) + 2(36) = 72\nP(30,0) = 2(30) + 2(0) = 60\nP(20,20) = 2(20) + 2(20) = 80\n\nThe maximum profit is $80, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of product A and 20 units of product B."
