    "message_1": "Airlines typically overbook their flights to compensate for no-shows. If an airline overbooks a flight by 10 seats, and the probability of a passenger showing up for the flight is 0.9, what is the probability that there will be at least one passenger who cannot board the flight due to overbooking?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one passenger cannot board the flight due to overbooking, we can first find the probability that all passengers can board the flight (i.e., 10 or fewer passengers show up) and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nLet's assume the flight has N seats. Then, the airline sells N+10 tickets. We want to find the probability that 10 or fewer passengers show up out of the N+10 ticket holders.\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula, the probability of k passengers showing up out of N+10 ticket holders is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(N+10, k) * (0.9)^k * (0.1)^(N+10-k)\n\nwhere C(N+10, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k passengers from N+10 ticket holders.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that 10 or fewer passengers show up:\n\nP(X≤10) = Σ P(X=k) for k=0 to 10\n\nP(X≤10) = Σ [C(N+10, k) * (0.9)^k * (0.1)^(N+10-k)] for k=0 to 10\n\nFinally, the probability that at least one passenger cannot board the flight due to overbooking is:\n\nP(at least one passenger cannot board) = 1 - P(X≤10)\n\nThis is the general formula. To find the exact probability, we need to know the value of N (the number of seats on the flight)."
