    "message_2": "Since f(x) is a non-periodic function, we cannot directly find the Fourier coefficients a0, an, and bn. However, we can find the Fourier coefficients for the periodic extension of f(x) with period 2L, where L is a positive constant.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients for a function with period 2L are given by:\n\na0 = (1/L) ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx\n\nan = (1/L) ∫[-L, L] f(x) cos(nπx/L) dx\n\nbn = (1/L) ∫[-L, L] f(x) sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nLet's compute these coefficients for n = 0, 1, and 2.\n\na0 = (1/L) ∫[-L, L] xe^(-x^2) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = -x^2, then du = -2x dx.\n\na0 = (1/L) ∫[-L, L] (-1/2) e^u du\n\nSince e^u is an even function, the integral of e^u over the symmetric interval [-L, L] is twice the integral over [0, L]. Therefore,\n\na0 = (1/L) (-1/2) [2 ∫[0, L] e^u du]\n\na0 = (1/L) (-1/2) [2 (e^u) | [0, L]]\n\na0 = (1/L) (-1/2) [2 (e^L - e^0)]\n\na0 = (1/L) (-1/2) [2 (e^L - 1)]\n\na0 = -e^L + 1\n\nNow let's compute an and bn for n = 1 and n = 2.\n\nan = (1/L) ∫[-L, L] xe^(-x^2) cos(nπx/L) dx\n\nbn = (1/L) ∫[-L, L] xe^(-x^2) sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nNotice that f(x) is an odd function, and cos(nπx/L) is an even function. The product of an odd function and an even function is an odd function. Since the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero, we have:\n\nan = 0 for n = 1, 2\n\nNow let's compute bn for n = 1 and n = 2.\n\nbn = (1/L) ∫[-L, L] xe^(-x^2) sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function and sin(nπx/L) is an odd function, their product is an even function. Therefore, we can compute the integral over [0, L] and multiply by 2:\n\nbn = (2/L) ∫[0, L] xe^(-x^2) sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nThis integral is difficult to compute analytically. However, we can approximate the values of b1 and b2 using numerical integration methods, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. Keep in mind that the values of b1 and b2 will depend on the choice of L.\n\nIn summary, the Fourier coefficients for the periodic extension of f(x) with period 2L are:\n\na0 = -e^L + 1\n\nan = 0 for n = 1, 2\n\nbn = (2/L) ∫[0, L] xe^(-x^2) sin(nπx/L) dx for n = 1, 2 (approximated using numerical integration)"
