    "message_2": "First, let's apply the reflection principle with respect to the real axis. The reflection of a complex number $z = x + yi$ with respect to the real axis is its complex conjugate, $\\bar{z} = x - yi$. So, the image of the unit disk under this reflection is the set of all complex numbers $\\bar{z}$ such that $|z| < 1$.\n\nNow, let's apply the reflection principle with respect to the unit circle $|z| = 1$. The reflection of a complex number $z$ with respect to the unit circle is given by its inverse, $z^{-1} = \\frac{1}{z}$. So, we need to find the image of the set of all complex numbers $\\bar{z}$ such that $|z| < 1$ under the transformation $z \\mapsto \\frac{1}{z}$.\n\nLet $w = \\frac{1}{\\bar{z}}$. Then, $\\bar{z} = \\frac{1}{w}$, and $z = \\frac{1}{\\bar{w}}$. Since $|z| < 1$, we have $|\\frac{1}{\\bar{w}}| < 1$, which implies $|\\bar{w}| > 1$. Thus, the image of the unit disk under the given transformations is the set of all complex numbers $w$ such that $|\\bar{w}| > 1$, or equivalently, $|w| > 1$. This is the exterior of the unit circle in the complex plane."
