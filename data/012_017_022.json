    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In this graph, we have 6 vertices, so a perfect matching will consist of 3 edges.\n\nWe can start by considering the possible edges that can be matched with vertex A. There are three possibilities: AC, AD, or AB. We will analyze each case separately.\n\n1. If A is matched with C (AC):\n   In this case, B must be matched with D (BD), which leaves E unmatched. Therefore, there is no perfect matching in this case.\n\n2. If A is matched with D (AD):\n   In this case, B can be matched with either C (BC) or E (BE). If B is matched with C, then E must be matched with D, but D is already matched with A. So, there is no perfect matching in this case either.\n\n   If B is matched with E, then C must be matched with D (CD). This gives us a perfect matching: {AD, BE, CD}.\n\n3. If A is matched with B (AB):\n   In this case, C can be matched with either D (CD) or E (CE). If C is matched with D, then E is left unmatched, so there is no perfect matching in this case.\n\n   If C is matched with E, then D must be matched with B, but B is already matched with A. So, there is no perfect matching in this case either.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one perfect matching for the graph G: {AD, BE, CD}."
