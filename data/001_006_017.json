    "message_2": "To find the y-coordinate of the vertex of the parabolic graph, we first need to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation y = ax² + bx + c. In this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 3.\n\nx = -(-4) / 2(1)\nx = 4 / 2\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging the x-value back into the quadratic equation:\n\ny = (2)² - 4(2) + 3\ny = 4 - 8 + 3\ny = -1\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of the vertex of the parabolic graph is -1."
