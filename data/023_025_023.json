    "message_1": "A piece of metal has a thermal diffusivity, α, of 9.7 x 10^-5 m^2/s. The temperature at any point of the object can be described as a function of time, t, and distance from the surface, x, such that T(x,t) = 100e^-αx^2t. Using Fourier transform, find the temperature distribution at t = 0.1 s.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution at t = 0.1 s using Fourier transform, we first need to express the given temperature function T(x, t) in terms of the spatial frequency domain using the Fourier transform formula. The one-dimensional Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), i is the imaginary unit, and k is the spatial frequency.\n\nIn our case, the function we want to transform is T(x, t) = 100e^(-αx^2t). We will find the Fourier transform of T(x, t) with respect to x and then evaluate it at t = 0.1 s.\n\nLet's denote the Fourier transform of T(x, t) as T_hat(k, t). Then,\n\nT_hat(k, t) = ∫[100e^(-αx^2t) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral. This integral is a Gaussian integral, and its solution can be found using the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫[e^(-ax^2 + bx)] dx = √(π/a) * e^(b^2/4a)\n\nApplying this formula to our integral, we get:\n\nT_hat(k, t) = 100√(π/αt) * e^(-π^2k^2/αt)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 0.1 s:\n\nT_hat(k, 0.1) = 100√(π/(9.7 * 10^-5 * 0.1)) * e^(-π^2k^2/(9.7 * 10^-5 * 0.1))\n\nT_hat(k, 0.1) = 100√(π/9.7 * 10^-6) * e^(-π^2k^2/9.7 * 10^-6)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution in the spatial frequency domain at t = 0.1 s. To find the temperature distribution in the spatial domain, we can apply the inverse Fourier transform. However, the inverse Fourier transform of this function does not have a simple closed-form expression. To obtain the temperature distribution in the spatial domain, numerical methods such as the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can be used."
