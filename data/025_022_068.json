Suppose that the derived category D^b(X) of bounded complexes of coherent sheaves on X has finite-dimensional cohomology spaces. Prove that the Euler characteristic of X is given by χ(X) = ∑ (-1)^i dim H^i (X, O_X). If X is a smooth complex projective surface, what is its Euler characteristic?",
    "message_2": "To prove that the Euler characteristic of X is given by χ(X) = ∑ (-1)^i dim H^i (X, O_X), we will use the fact that the Euler characteristic is additive with respect to short exact sequences of coherent sheaves.\n\nLet 0 → F' → F → F'' → 0 be a short exact sequence of coherent sheaves on X. Then, we have the long exact sequence in cohomology:\n\n0 → H^0(X, F') → H^0(X, F) → H^0(X, F'') → H^1(X, F') → H^1(X, F) → ...\n\nBy the additivity of the Euler characteristic, we have:\n\nχ(X, F) = χ(X, F') + χ(X, F'').\n\nNow, consider the short exact sequence of sheaves:\n\n0 → O_X → O_X → O_X → 0.\n\nApplying the additivity of the Euler characteristic, we get:\n\nχ(X) = χ(X, O_X) + χ(X, O_X).\n\nSince the derived category D^b(X) has finite-dimensional cohomology spaces, we can compute the Euler characteristic as the alternating sum of the dimensions of the cohomology spaces:\n\nχ(X) = ∑ (-1)^i dim H^i (X, O_X).\n\nNow, let X be a smooth complex projective surface. By the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\nχ(X, O_X) = (1/12)(c_1^2(X) + c_2(X)),\n\nwhere c_1(X) and c_2(X) are the first and second Chern classes of X, respectively.\n\nFor a smooth complex projective surface, c_1^2(X) is always even, and c_2(X) is always divisible by 12. Therefore, χ(X, O_X) is an integer.\n\nSince X is a smooth complex projective surface, its Euler characteristic is given by the same formula:\n\nχ(X) = ∑ (-1)^i dim H^i (X, O_X) = χ(X, O_X).\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic of a smooth complex projective surface is an integer."
