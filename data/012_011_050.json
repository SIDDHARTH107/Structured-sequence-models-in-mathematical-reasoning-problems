    "message_2": "To determine the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we need to analyze the graph's structure. However, the problem does not provide any specific information about the graph's structure, such as whether it is connected or not, or any details about the vertices' degrees.\n\nIn general, a cut vertex is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nWithout more information about the graph's structure, we cannot determine the exact number of cut vertices and bridges. However, we can provide some bounds on the number of cut vertices and bridges based on the given information.\n\nFor a graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges, the maximum number of cut vertices can be 8, which occurs when the graph is a tree (i.e., a connected graph with no cycles). In this case, removing any vertex except the leaves will increase the number of connected components. The minimum number of cut vertices is 0, which occurs when the graph is a complete graph (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex), but this is not possible with only 12 edges.\n\nThe maximum number of bridges can also be 12, which occurs when the graph is a tree, as every edge in a tree is a bridge. The minimum number of bridges is 0, which occurs when the graph has a cycle and is connected.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the graph's structure, we cannot determine the exact number of cut vertices and bridges. However, we can say that the number of cut vertices is between 0 and 8, and the number of bridges is between 0 and 12."
