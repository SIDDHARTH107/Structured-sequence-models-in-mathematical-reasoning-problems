    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, we first compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y.\n$$\n\nA critical point occurs when both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$$\n2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0, \\quad 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0.\n$$\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, which is $(0,0)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify this critical point using Morse theory. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation:\n\n$$\n\\det(H(f) - \\lambda I) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n2 - \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 - \\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix} = (2 - \\lambda)^2.\n$$\n\nThis equation has a double root at $\\lambda = 2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the Hessian matrix is positive definite, and by Morse theory, the critical point $(0,0)$ is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one critical point, which is $(0,0)$, and it is a local minimum."
