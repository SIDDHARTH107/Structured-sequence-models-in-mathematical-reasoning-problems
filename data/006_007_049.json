    "message_1": "What is the probability of a stock price increase of at least $50 within the next 3 months, given that the stock has historically had a standard deviation of $20 and a mean increase of $30 within a 3-month period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Z-score formula to standardize the value and then find the probability using a standard normal distribution table (also known as the Z-table).\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere:\n- Z is the Z-score\n- X is the value we want to find the probability for (in this case, a $50 increase)\n- μ is the mean (in this case, a $30 increase)\n- σ is the standard deviation (in this case, $20)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nZ = ($50 - $30) / $20\nZ = $20 / $20\nZ = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of having a Z-score of 1 or higher. We can use a standard normal distribution table for this. Looking up a Z-score of 1 in the table, we find that the probability of having a Z-score less than 1 is approximately 0.8413. Since we want the probability of a Z-score of 1 or higher, we need to subtract this value from 1:\n\nProbability (Z ≥ 1) = 1 - 0.8413\nProbability (Z ≥ 1) ≈ 0.1587\n\nSo, the probability of a stock price increase of at least $50 within the next 3 months is approximately 15.87%."
