    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, vertical shift, and phase shift of the given function y = -3sin(2x + π/4) + 2, we can compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D.\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = |-3| = 3. So, the amplitude is 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sinusoidal function is the length of one complete cycle. For a sine function, the period is given by the formula P = 2π/B. In this case, B = 2, so the period is P = 2π/2 = π. So, the period is π.\n\nVertical Shift (D): The vertical shift is the value added or subtracted from the sine function, which moves the graph up or down. In this case, D = 2. So, the vertical shift is 2 units up.\n\nPhase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value that is subtracted from the input (x) inside the sine function, which moves the graph left or right. In this case, we have B(x - C) = 2x + π/4. To find C, we can rewrite the expression as 2(x - (-π/8)) = 2x + π/4. So, C = -π/8. The phase shift is π/8 units to the left.\n\nIn summary:\n- Amplitude: 3\n- Period: π\n- Vertical Shift: 2 units up\n- Phase Shift: π/8 units to the left"
