    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B, which is denoted as A∩B. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA∩B = {2, 3} (since 2 and 3 are the common elements in both sets)\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A∩B) and C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set, and b is an element of the second set.\n\nC = {5, 6, 7}\n\n(A∩B) x C = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)}\n\nNow, let's show that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection. We need to show that:\n\n(A x C) ∩ (B x C) = (A∩B) x C\n\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian products A x C and B x C:\n\nA x C = {(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)}\nB x C = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A x C) ∩ (B x C) = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)}\n\nComparing the results, we can see that:\n\n(A x C) ∩ (B x C) = (A∩B) x C\n\n{(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)} = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)}\n\nThus, the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection."
