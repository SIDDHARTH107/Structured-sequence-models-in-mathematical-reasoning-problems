    "message_2": "An isometry is a map that preserves the distance between points. In this case, we are looking for an isometry $f$ that maps the origin to itself and maps the point $(1,0)$ to the point $(3,4)$. \n\nFirst, we notice that the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ is 1, and the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(3,4)$ is 5. Therefore, the isometry must be a combination of a rotation and a dilation. \n\nLet $f(x,y) = (ax - by + c, bx + ay + d)$, where $a, b, c, d$ are constants. Since $f(0,0) = (0,0)$, we have $c = 0$ and $d = 0$. Now we have $f(x,y) = (ax - by, bx + ay)$.\n\nWe are given that $f(1,0) = (3,4)$. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n$(a - 0, b + 0) = (3,4)$\n\nSo, $a = 3$ and $b = 4$. Thus, the isometry is given by:\n\n$f(x,y) = (3x - 4y, 4x + 3y)$\n\nNow we need to verify that this is indeed an isometry. Let $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ be two arbitrary points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Then the distance between $P$ and $Q$ in the standard metric is given by:\n\n$g(P,Q) = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\n\nNow let's compute the distance between $f(P)$ and $f(Q)$:\n\n$f(P) = (3x_1 - 4y_1, 4x_1 + 3y_1)$\n$f(Q) = (3x_2 - 4y_2, 4x_2 + 3y_2)$\n\n$g(f(P), f(Q)) = \\sqrt{((3x_2 - 4y_2) - (3x_1 - 4y_1))^2 + ((4x_2 + 3y_2) - (4x_1 + 3y_1))^2}$\n\n$= \\sqrt{(3(x_2 - x_1) - 4(y_2 - y_1))^2 + (4(x_2 - x_1) + 3(y_2 - y_1))^2}$\n\n$= \\sqrt{9(x_2 - x_1)^2 - 24(x_2 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1) + 16(y_2 - y_1)^2}$\n\n$= \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\n\nSince $g(f(P), f(Q)) = g(P,Q)$ for all points $P$ and $Q$, the map $f(x,y) = (3x - 4y, 4x + 3y)$ is indeed an isometry. Therefore, the isometry we are looking for is:\n\n$f(x,y) = (3x - 4y, 4x + 3y)$"
