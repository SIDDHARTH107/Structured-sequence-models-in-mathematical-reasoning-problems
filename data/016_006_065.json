    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) with four affine transformations. The scaling ratio of the Barnsley fern after four iterations can be found by analyzing the scaling factors of each transformation and their probabilities.\n\nThe four affine transformations used to create the Barnsley fern are as follows:\n\n1. f1(x, y) = (0.85x + 0.04y, -0.04x + 0.85y + 1.6) with probability 0.85\n2. f2(x, y) = (0.2x - 0.26y, 0.23x + 0.22y + 1.6) with probability 0.07\n3. f3(x, y) = (-0.15x + 0.28y, 0.26x + 0.24y + 0.44) with probability 0.07\n4. f4(x, y) = (0, 0.16y) with probability 0.01\n\nThe scaling factors for each transformation can be found by calculating the determinant of the linear part of the transformation matrix:\n\n1. det(A1) = det([[0.85, 0.04], [-0.04, 0.85]]) = 0.85^2 - 0.04^2 = 0.7225\n2. det(A2) = det([[0.2, -0.26], [0.23, 0.22]]) = 0.2 * 0.22 - (-0.26) * 0.23 = 0.044\n3. det(A3) = det([[-0.15, 0.28], [0.26, 0.24]]) = (-0.15) * 0.24 - 0.28 * 0.26 = -0.036\n4. det(A4) = det([[0, 0], [0, 0.16]]) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the average scaling factor after four iterations by considering the probabilities of each transformation:\n\naverage_scaling_factor = 0.85 * 0.7225 + 0.07 * 0.044 + 0.07 * (-0.036) + 0.01 * 0 = 0.614125\n\nAfter four iterations, the scaling ratio of the Barnsley fern will be the average scaling factor raised to the power of 4:\n\nscaling_ratio = (average_scaling_factor)^4 = (0.614125)^4 â‰ˆ 0.141267\n\nSo, the scaling ratio of the Barnsley fern after four iterations is approximately 0.141267."
