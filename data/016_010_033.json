    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by recursively filling the interstices between tangent circles with new tangent circles. In this case, we start with three tangent circles with radii 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's denote the number of circles in the nth generation as C(n). We know that C(0) = 3 since we start with three circles.\n\nFor each new generation, we add circles in the interstices between the existing circles. In the first generation, there is only one interstice between the three initial circles, so we add one circle. Thus, C(1) = C(0) + 1 = 4.\n\nFrom the second generation onwards, the number of new circles added in each generation follows a pattern. In the second generation, we add circles in the interstices between the new circle from the first generation and the three initial circles, which gives us three new circles. So, C(2) = C(1) + 3 = 7.\n\nIn general, the number of new circles added in the nth generation is 2^(n-1) * 3. Therefore, the total number of circles in the nth generation can be calculated as:\n\nC(n) = C(n-1) + 2^(n-1) * 3\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of circles in the 7th generation:\n\nC(7) = C(6) + 2^(7-1) * 3\nC(6) = C(5) + 2^(6-1) * 3\nC(5) = C(4) + 2^(5-1) * 3\nC(4) = C(3) + 2^(4-1) * 3\nC(3) = C(2) + 2^(3-1) * 3\n\nWe already know C(2) = 7, so we can calculate the rest:\n\nC(3) = 7 + 2^2 * 3 = 7 + 12 = 19\nC(4) = 19 + 2^3 * 3 = 19 + 24 = 43\nC(5) = 43 + 2^4 * 3 = 43 + 48 = 91\nC(6) = 91 + 2^5 * 3 = 91 + 96 = 187\nC(7) = 187 + 2^6 * 3 = 187 + 192 = 379\n\nSo, the total number of circles in the 7th generation of the Apollonian gasket with the initial configuration of three tangent circles with radii 1, 2, and 3 is 379."
