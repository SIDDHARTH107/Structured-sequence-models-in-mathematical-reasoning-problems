    "message_1": "What is the order of the entire function defined by $f(z) = e^{z^2 + 3z + 7}$?\n\nTo solve this problem, the student would need to use the definition of the order of an entire function and apply it to $f(z)$. They would need to find the largest value of $\\alpha$ such that $|f(z)| \\leq e^{M|z|^\\alpha}$ for some positive constants $M$ and $|z|$.",
    "message_2": "To find the order of the entire function $f(z) = e^{z^2 + 3z + 7}$, we first need to analyze the growth of the function.\n\nLet's rewrite the function as $f(z) = e^{z^2} \\cdot e^{3z} \\cdot e^7$. Now, we can analyze the growth of each part separately.\n\n1. $e^{z^2}$: The growth of this part is determined by the quadratic term $z^2$. As $|z|$ goes to infinity, the growth of this part is faster than any polynomial.\n\n2. $e^{3z}$: The growth of this part is determined by the linear term $3z$. As $|z|$ goes to infinity, the growth of this part is faster than any polynomial.\n\n3. $e^7$: This is just a constant factor and does not affect the growth of the function.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest value of $\\alpha$ such that $|f(z)| \\leq e^{M|z|^\\alpha}$ for some positive constants $M$ and $|z|$.\n\nSince the growth of $f(z)$ is determined by the quadratic term $z^2$, we can say that the order of the entire function is $\\alpha = 2$. This is because the growth of $f(z)$ is faster than any polynomial of degree less than 2, and the inequality $|f(z)| \\leq e^{M|z|^2}$ holds for some positive constant $M$ and $|z|$.\n\nSo, the order of the entire function $f(z) = e^{z^2 + 3z + 7}$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
