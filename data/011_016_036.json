    "message_2": "In a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD), each pair of treatments occurs together in the same block the same number of times, denoted by λ. To find λ, we can use the following formula:\n\nλ = (r - 1) / (k - 1)\n\nwhere r is the number of times each treatment appears in the design, and k is the number of treatments in each block.\n\nFirst, we need to find r. Since there are 15 treatments and 5 blocks, each block must contain 3 treatments. The total number of treatments in the design is 15, so the total number of treatments in all blocks is 15 * 3 = 45. Since there are 5 blocks, each treatment must appear 45 / 15 = 3 times in the design. So, r = 3.\n\nNow we can find λ:\n\nλ = (r - 1) / (k - 1)\nλ = (3 - 1) / (3 - 1)\nλ = 2 / 2\nλ = 1\n\nSo, in this balanced incomplete block design, each specific pair of treatments appears together in the same block 1 time."
