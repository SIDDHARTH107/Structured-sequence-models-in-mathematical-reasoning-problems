    "message_2": "To find the probability of a flood occurring at least once in the next five years, we can first find the probability of a flood NOT occurring in any of the five years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a flood not occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nFor a flood not to occur in any of the five years, this has to happen in each of the five years. So, the probability of no flood in five years is (0.8)^5 = 0.32768.\n\nNow, to find the probability of a flood occurring at least once in the next five years, we subtract the probability of no flood from 1:\n\n1 - 0.32768 = 0.67232\n\nSo, the probability of a flood occurring at least once in the next five years is approximately 0.67232 or 67.23%."
