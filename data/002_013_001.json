    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base of length 8 cm and width 6 cm, and a height of 12 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width\nBase Area = 8 cm * 6 cm\nBase Area = 48 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume using the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\nVolume = (1/3) * 48 cm² * 12 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 576 cm³\nVolume = 192 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 192 cubic centimeters."
