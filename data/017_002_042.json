    "message_2": "Let H be a subgroup of G. Since G is a cyclic group generated by g with order n, we can write G = {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^(n-1)}. The order of H must be a divisor of n, say m, where m divides n. \n\nAccording to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group. So, the order of H, which is m, divides the order of G, which is n.\n\nNow, let h be a generator of H. Then H = {h^0, h^1, h^2, ..., h^(m-1)}. Since H is a subgroup of G, every element of H must also be an element of G. Therefore, we can write h = g^k for some integer k.\n\nThe generator of H, h, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. h^m = e (the identity element of G), where m is the order of H.\n2. For any element x in H, there exists an integer j such that x = h^j.\n\nTo find the generator h, we need to find the smallest positive integer k such that g^k is an element of H and the order of g^k in G is m. This can be achieved by choosing k such that k = n/m, where n is the order of G and m is the order of H. \n\nSo, the generator of H is h = g^(n/m)."
