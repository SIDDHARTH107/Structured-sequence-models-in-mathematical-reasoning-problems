    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative method used to solve a system of linear equations. The idea is to rearrange each equation in the system so that the variable on the left side is isolated, and then iteratively update the variables using the rearranged equations.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the given system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 4\n-2x + 4y + 2z = -6\nx - y - 5z = -14\n\nRearrange the equations to isolate x, y, and z:\n\nx = (4 - 2y + z) / 3\ny = (-6 + 2x + 2z) / 4\nz = (-14 - x + y) / -5\n\nNow, we will perform the first three iterations of the Jacobi method starting with x0 = (0, 0, 0) and using a tolerance level of 0.01.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (4 - 2(0) + 0) / 3 = 4/3\ny1 = (-6 + 2(0) + 2(0)) / 4 = -3/2\nz1 = (-14 - 0 + 0) / -5 = 14/5\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (4 - 2(-3/2) + 14/5) / 3 = (4 + 3 + 14/5) / 3 = (23/5) / 3 = 23/15\ny2 = (-6 + 2(4/3) + 2(14/5)) / 4 = (-6 + 8/3 + 28/5) / 4 = (2/15) / 4 = 1/30\nz2 = (-14 - 4/3 + (-3/2)) / -5 = (-14 - 4/3 - 3/2) / -5 = (49/6) / -5 = -49/30\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (4 - 2(1/30) + (-49/30)) / 3 = (4 - 1/15 - 49/30) / 3 = (31/30) / 3 = 31/90\ny3 = (-6 + 2(23/15) + 2(-49/30)) / 4 = (-6 + 46/15 - 49/15) / 4 = (-3/15) / 4 = -1/20\nz3 = (-14 - 23/15 + 1/30) / -5 = (-14 - 23/15 + 1/30) / -5 = (157/30) / -5 = -157/150\n\nAfter three iterations, we have the following approximate solutions:\n\nx ≈ 31/90\ny ≈ -1/20\nz ≈ -157/150\n\nSince we have not reached the tolerance level of 0.01, we would need to continue iterating until the difference between consecutive iterations is less than the tolerance level."
