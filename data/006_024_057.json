    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, tourists getting motion sickness)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of tourists, which is 10)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of tourists getting motion sickness, which is 3)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a tourist getting motion sickness, which is 0.2)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a tourist not getting motion sickness, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * 0.2^3 * 0.8^7\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(10, 3):\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!) = 10! / (3!7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 120 * 0.2^3 * 0.8^7 â‰ˆ 0.201\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 tourists get motion sickness during the trip is approximately 0.201 or 20.1%."
