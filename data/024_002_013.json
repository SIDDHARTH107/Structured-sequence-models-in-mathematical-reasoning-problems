    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 between the points (1,0,1) and (-1,0,1), we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we need to parameterize the curve on the surface. Let's use the parameter t, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, and write the curve as:\n\nr(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\n\nSince the curve lies on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we have:\n\nz(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the length of the curve. The length L of the curve can be expressed as:\n\nL = ∫(0 to 1) sqrt(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + z'(t)^2) dt\n\nUsing the constraint z(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2, we can write:\n\nL = ∫(0 to 1) sqrt(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + (2x(t)x'(t) + 2y(t)y'(t))^2) dt\n\nTo find the geodesic, we need to minimize the length L. We can do this using the Euler-Lagrange equations, which state that for a functional F(x, y, z, x', y', z'):\n\nd/dt (∂F/∂x') - ∂F/∂x = 0\nd/dt (∂F/∂y') - ∂F/∂y = 0\nd/dt (∂F/∂z') - ∂F/∂z = 0\n\nApplying the Euler-Lagrange equations to our problem, we get a system of differential equations:\n\nx''(t) - 4x(t)(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2) = 0\ny''(t) - 4y(t)(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2) = 0\n\nwith the boundary conditions:\n\nx(0) = 1, y(0) = 0, x(1) = -1, y(1) = 0\n\nSolving this system of differential equations is quite challenging and typically requires numerical methods. However, we can make an educated guess for the geodesic. Since the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is a paraboloid, we expect the geodesic to be a straight line in the xy-plane, connecting the points (1,0) and (-1,0). This line can be parameterized as:\n\nx(t) = 1 - 2t\ny(t) = 0\n\nPlugging this into the constraint equation, we get:\n\nz(t) = (1 - 2t)^2\n\nThus, the geodesic is given by the curve:\n\nr(t) = (1 - 2t, 0, (1 - 2t)^2)\n\nfor 0 ≤ t ≤ 1."
