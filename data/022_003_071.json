    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (holomorphic) in a simply connected domain, and C is a closed contour in that domain, then the integral of the function over the contour is zero.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 + 3z + 2 is a polynomial, and polynomials are analytic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic in the domain containing the circle C.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic in the domain containing C, we can apply Cauchy's theorem:\n\n∫C f(z) dz = 0"
