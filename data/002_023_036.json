    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)²\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm²\n\nSurface Area = 100π cm²\n\nApproximately, Surface Area ≈ 100 * 3.1416 cm² ≈ 314.16 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 314.16 cm²."
