    "message_2": "There are two isomorphism classes of groups with order 10:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 10 (C10)\n2. Dihedral group of order 10 (D10)\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 10 (C10):\nExample: The group of integers modulo 10 under addition, denoted as Z10 or C10.\nThis group is isomorphic to the class of cyclic groups of order 10 because it has one generator (1 or 9) that can generate all the other elements in the group by repeated addition. The elements of this group are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the group operation is addition modulo 10. Since it is a cyclic group, it is abelian.\n\n2. Dihedral group of order 10 (D10):\nExample: The group of symmetries of a regular pentagon, denoted as D5 or D10.\nThis group is isomorphic to the class of dihedral groups of order 10 because it consists of 5 rotations and 5 reflections, making a total of 10 elements. The elements of this group can be represented as {r^k, sr^k} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, where r is a rotation by 72 degrees (2Ï€/5 radians) and s is a reflection about an axis of symmetry. The group operation is the composition of symmetries. This group is non-abelian.\n\nIn summary, the two isomorphism classes of groups with order 10 are the cyclic group C10 (e.g., Z10) and the dihedral group D10 (e.g., symmetries of a regular pentagon)."
