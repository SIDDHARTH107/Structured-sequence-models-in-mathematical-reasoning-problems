The cost of producing one unit of product A is $2 and the cost of producing one unit of product B is $3. The company sold 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B, earning a total revenue of $1,450. But the data shows that due to some noise, the number of units sold might have been distorted by a small error margin of ±10 units. \n\nFind the exact number of units sold for each product A and B and their respective selling prices given that product A was sold at a price of $8 per unit and product B was sold at a price of $10 per unit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A sold and y be the number of units of product B sold. We are given that product A was sold at a price of $8 per unit and product B was sold at a price of $10 per unit. The total revenue earned is $1,450. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n8x + 10y = 1450\n\nWe are also given that the company sold 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B, but there might be an error margin of ±10 units. So, we can write the inequalities:\n\n190 ≤ x ≤ 210\n140 ≤ y ≤ 160\n\nNow, we need to find the exact number of units sold for each product A and B that satisfy the equation and inequalities.\n\nWe can start by solving the equation for y:\n\ny = (1450 - 8x) / 10\n\nNow, we can plug in the lower and upper bounds of x and check if the resulting y values are within the given range for y:\n\nFor x = 190:\ny = (1450 - 8*190) / 10\ny = 70\n\nFor x = 210:\ny = (1450 - 8*210) / 10\ny = 50\n\nSince y = 70 is within the given range for y (140 ≤ y ≤ 160), we can use x = 190 and y = 70 as the exact number of units sold for each product A and B.\n\nNow, we can find the selling prices for each product:\n\nSelling price of product A = Total revenue from product A / Number of units of product A sold\n= (8 * 190) / 190\n= $8 per unit\n\nSelling price of product B = Total revenue from product B / Number of units of product B sold\n= (10 * 70) / 70\n= $10 per unit\n\nSo, the exact number of units sold for product A is 190 at a selling price of $8 per unit, and the exact number of units sold for product B is 70 at a selling price of $10 per unit."
