    "message_1": "A rectangular garden has a length of 20 meters and a width of 10 meters. What is the perimeter of the garden in meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 20 meters and the width (W) is 10 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(20 + 10)\nP = 2(30)\nP = 60 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is 60 meters."
