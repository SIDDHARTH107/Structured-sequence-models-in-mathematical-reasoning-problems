    "message_1": "During a data analysis project, a math student needs to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a dataset. The dataset contains scores of 50 students in 5 different subjects. The student wants to reduce the dimensions of the dataset to two using PCA so that the dataset can be plotted on the Cartesian plane. \n\nThe dataset can be represented as a matrix X of size 50 x 5, where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject. The student wants to compute the first two principal components of X and plot the dataset on the two principal components. \n\nWhat are the values ​​of the first two principal components, and how much of the total variance do they represent?",
    "message_2": "To compute the first two principal components and the total variance they represent, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the dataset: Since PCA is affected by the scale of the variables, we need to standardize the dataset so that each variable has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\n2. Compute the covariance matrix: Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized dataset to understand how the variables are related to each other.\n\n3. Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues: Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the eigenvalues represent the variance explained by each principal component.\n\n4. Sort the eigenvectors by their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order: This will give us the principal components in order of importance.\n\n5. Select the first two principal components: Choose the first two eigenvectors (corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues) as the first two principal components.\n\n6. Project the dataset onto the first two principal components: Multiply the standardized dataset by the first two principal components to obtain the new dataset with reduced dimensions.\n\nUnfortunately, without the actual dataset, we cannot compute the exact values of the first two principal components and the total variance they represent. However, once you have the dataset, you can follow these steps to perform PCA and obtain the required information."
