    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems and properties of groups of order p^3, where p is a prime number.\n\nSince G is a group of order 27, we know that |G| = 27 = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G, denoted n_3, must divide the order of G and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. By the Sylow theorems, every element of order 3 or 9 in G must be in P. If there exists an element of order 9 in P, then P is cyclic and G has an element of order 27, making G isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, let P, Q, and R be these subgroups. Each of these subgroups has order 9. Since the intersection of any two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups must have order dividing 3, the intersection of any two of these subgroups must be a subgroup of order 3. Let x be an element of order 3 in P ∩ Q. Then, the order of x in G must be a multiple of 3, so the order of x is either 3, 9, or 27.\n\nIf the order of x is 27, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C27. If the order of x is 9, then G has an element of order 9, and G is either cyclic or non-abelian of order 27. If the order of x is 3, then G has an element of order 3, and G is either cyclic or non-abelian of order 27.\n\nIn all cases, we have shown that there exists an element in G such that its order is either 1, 3, 9, or 27. Therefore, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27."
