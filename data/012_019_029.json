    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic index of the graph, we can use Vizing's theorem, which states that the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either its maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn this graph, the maximum degree Δ(G) is 3, as there are vertices with 3 edges connected to them. Now, we will try to color the edges using 3 colors.\n\nLet's use the colors Red (R), Blue (B), and Green (G). We can color the edges as follows:\n\n1. Color the top-left edge R.\n2. Color the top-right edge B.\n3. Color the bottom-left edge B.\n4. Color the bottom-right edge R.\n5. Color the left vertical edge G.\n6. Color the right vertical edge G.\n7. Color the top horizontal edge B.\n8. Color the bottom horizontal edge R.\n\nThe resulting colored graph will have no two adjacent edges with the same color, and we used 3 colors. Therefore, the chromatic index of the graph is 3."
