    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set obtained by removing the middle third from each line segment of the interval [0,1] can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and M is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor set obtained by removing the middle third, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces (the left and right thirds), and the scaling factor is M = 3 (since each piece is 1/3 the size of the original interval).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThis dimension remains the same regardless of how many times the middle third is removed, including 7 times."
