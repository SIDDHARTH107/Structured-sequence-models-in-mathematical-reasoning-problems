    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2 - 3xy\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y, z) where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n3z^2 - 3xy = 0\n\nDivide each equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\nz^2 - xy = 0\n\nNow, let's analyze the system of equations. If x = 0, then from the first equation, yz = 0. If y = 0, then from the second equation, xz = 0. If z = 0, then from the third equation, xy = 0. In each case, at least two of the variables must be zero. \n\nThus, the singular points are (0, 0, 0), (0, y, 0), (x, 0, 0), and (0, 0, z) for any values of x, y, and z."
