If the wind is blowing from the south at 50 km/h, find the component of the plane's velocity that is fighting against the wind. Round your answer to the nearest whole number in km/h.",
    "message_2": "To find the component of the plane's velocity that is fighting against the wind, we need to break down the plane's velocity into its east-west and north-south components, and then find the component that is opposite to the wind's direction.\n\nFirst, let's find the east-west (x) and north-south (y) components of the plane's velocity:\n\nx = 400 * cos(135°)\ny = 400 * sin(135°)\n\nNote that 135° is in the second quadrant, where both sine and cosine are positive.\n\nx = 400 * cos(135°) = 400 * (-0.7071) = -282.84 km/h\ny = 400 * sin(135°) = 400 * (0.7071) = 282.84 km/h\n\nNow, the wind is blowing from the south, which means it is blowing in the north direction. So, we need to find the component of the plane's velocity that is fighting against the wind, which is the north-south component (y).\n\nThe component of the plane's velocity that is fighting against the wind is 282.84 km/h (rounded to the nearest whole number)."
