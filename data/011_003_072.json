    "message_1": "A committee of five students is to be formed from a class of twelve students. How many different committees can be formed if there must be at least one male and one female student on the committee? Use Pascal's triangle to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's triangle, we first need to find the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 students from a class of 12 students, and then subtract the number of ways to form a committee with only male students or only female students.\n\nLet's assume there are M male students and F female students in the class, with M + F = 12.\n\nThe total number of ways to form a committee of 5 students from a class of 12 students can be found using the combination formula, which is represented in Pascal's triangle:\n\nC(n, k) = C(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * (12-5)!)\n\nUsing Pascal's triangle, we can find the value for C(12, 5) in the 13th row (remember that Pascal's triangle starts with row 0) and the 6th element:\n\n1 12 66 220 495 792 924 792 495 220 66 12 1\n\nC(12, 5) = 792\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of ways to form a committee with only male students or only female students. Let's find the number of ways to form a committee with only male students:\n\nC(M, 5) = M! / (5! * (M-5)!)\n\nSimilarly, let's find the number of ways to form a committee with only female students:\n\nC(F, 5) = F! / (5! * (F-5)!)\n\nSince there must be at least one male and one female student on the committee, the total number of different committees that can be formed is:\n\nTotal committees = C(12, 5) - C(M, 5) - C(F, 5)\n\nHowever, we don't have the values for M and F. In order to solve this problem, we need more information about the number of male and female students in the class."
