    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by iteratively removing tetrahedra from a larger tetrahedron. After each iteration, the volume of the remaining structure is reduced.\n\nIn the first iteration, the original tetrahedron is divided into four smaller, congruent tetrahedra, and the central one is removed. This leaves 3/4 of the original volume.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the three remaining tetrahedra from the first iteration is again divided into four smaller tetrahedra, and the central one is removed. This leaves 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 of the original volume.\n\nAfter the third iteration, the same process is repeated for each of the nine remaining tetrahedra from the second iteration. This leaves 3/4 * 9/16 = 27/64 of the original volume.\n\nSo, if the initial volume of the Sierpinski tetrahedron is 1 cubic unit, after three iterations, the volume will be 27/64 cubic units."
