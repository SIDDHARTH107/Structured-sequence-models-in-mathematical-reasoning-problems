    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can explain the process of encryption using a Feistel cipher, but I cannot provide the exact ciphertext without knowing the specific key and round functions used in the cipher.\n\nA Feistel cipher works as follows:\n\n1. The plaintext is divided into two equal parts, the left half (L0) and the right half (R0).\n2. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main key using a key schedule algorithm.\n3. The round function is applied to the right half of the data and the subkey for that round.\n4. The output of the round function is XORed with the left half of the data.\n5. The halves are swapped for the next round, except for the last round where no swap is performed.\n\nAfter 16 rounds, the final left and right halves are combined to form the ciphertext.\n\nGiven the plaintext \"1100101011110010\", we can divide it into two halves:\n\nL0 = 1100 1010\nR0 = 1111 0010\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific key and round functions, we cannot proceed further to calculate the ciphertext. In practice, the key and round functions are designed to provide strong security and resistance against various attacks."
