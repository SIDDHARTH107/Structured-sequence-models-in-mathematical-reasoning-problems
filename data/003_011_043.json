    "message_1": "A building is located 500 meters away from a lighthouse. The angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the lighthouse is 30 degrees. What is the height of the lighthouse rounded to the nearest meter? (Assume the building and the lighthouse are at the same elevation.)",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the lighthouse, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, we have the angle of elevation (30 degrees) and the distance from the building to the lighthouse (500 meters). We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 500\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 500:\n\nheight = 500 * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can multiply this value by 500 to find the height:\n\nheight ≈ 500 * 0.577\nheight ≈ 288.5\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the height of the lighthouse is approximately 289 meters."
