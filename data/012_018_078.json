    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges whose removal results in a disconnected graph or a trivial graph (a single vertex).\n\nTo determine the edge connectivity of a graph with 8 vertices and 14 edges, we can use the following inequality:\n\nedge connectivity â‰¤ minimum degree\n\nThe minimum degree of a vertex in a graph is the smallest number of edges connected to any vertex in the graph. Since the graph has 8 vertices and 14 edges, the average degree of a vertex in the graph is (2 * 14) / 8 = 3.5. Since the average degree is 3.5, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less.\n\nTherefore, the edge connectivity of the graph is at most 3. We cannot determine the exact edge connectivity without more information about the specific graph, but we know that it is at most 3."
