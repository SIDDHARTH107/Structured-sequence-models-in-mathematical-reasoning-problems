    "message_1": "A student is standing 15 meters away from the base of a tree. If the angle of elevation from the student's eyes to the top of the tree is 45 degrees, what is the height of the tree to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and we are given the distance from the student to the tree (15 meters), which is the adjacent side. We want to find the height of the tree, which is the side opposite the angle.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45Â°) = height / 15\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 15\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 15 * 1\n\nheight = 15 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree is approximately 15 meters."
