    "message_2": "To find the intersection cohomology groups of a singular projective variety with given Betti numbers, we can use the Poincaré duality theorem. The Poincaré duality theorem states that for a compact, oriented, smooth manifold of dimension n, the k-th cohomology group is isomorphic to the (n-k)-th cohomology group. In our case, the singular projective variety has dimension 4, as the highest Betti number is $b_4=1$.\n\nUsing Poincaré duality, we can find the intersection cohomology groups as follows:\n\n- $IH^0 = H^0 = \\mathbb{Z}^1$, since $b_0=1$.\n- $IH^1 = H^3 = \\mathbb{Z}^2$, since $b_3=2$.\n- $IH^2 = H^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^3$, since $b_2=3$.\n- $IH^3 = H^1 = \\mathbb{Z}^2$, since $b_1=2$.\n- $IH^4 = H^0 = \\mathbb{Z}^1$, since $b_0=1$.\n\nSo, the intersection cohomology groups of the singular projective variety are:\n\n$IH^0 = \\mathbb{Z}^1$,\n$IH^1 = \\mathbb{Z}^2$,\n$IH^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^3$,\n$IH^3 = \\mathbb{Z}^2$,\n$IH^4 = \\mathbb{Z}^1$."
