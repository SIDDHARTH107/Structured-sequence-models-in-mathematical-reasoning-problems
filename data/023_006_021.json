    "message_1": "A signal $f(t)=\\sin(2\\pi 500 t)+0.5\\sin(2\\pi 1000 t)$ is transmitted over a cable. Use Fourier transform to determine the frequency components of the signal.",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequency components of the signal, we can analyze the given function $f(t)$. The Fourier transform is used to convert a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. However, in this case, we can directly identify the frequency components from the given function without computing the Fourier transform.\n\nThe function is given by:\n\n$f(t) = \\sin(2\\pi 500 t) + 0.5\\sin(2\\pi 1000 t)$\n\nThe function consists of two sinusoidal components:\n\n1. $\\sin(2\\pi 500 t)$: This component has a frequency of $500$ Hz, as it can be written as $\\sin(2\\pi f_1 t)$ with $f_1 = 500$ Hz.\n\n2. $0.5\\sin(2\\pi 1000 t)$: This component has a frequency of $1000$ Hz, as it can be written as $0.5\\sin(2\\pi f_2 t)$ with $f_2 = 1000$ Hz.\n\nSo, the frequency components of the signal are $500$ Hz and $1000$ Hz."
