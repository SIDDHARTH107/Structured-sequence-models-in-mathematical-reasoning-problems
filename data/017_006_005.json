    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power orders. Since 35 = 5 * 7, the only possibilities are that G is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 35, or G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to Z_35 (the integers modulo 35 under addition), which is a cyclic group of order 35.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then G must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7. Let H be a subgroup of G of order 5 and K be a subgroup of G of order 7. By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) and the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n_7) must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo the respective prime. \n\nFor n_5, we have the possible divisors of 35 as 1, 5, 7, and 35. The only divisor that is congruent to 1 modulo 5 is 1. Therefore, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, H, and it is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, for n_7, the possible divisors of 35 are 1, 5, 7, and 35. The only divisor that is congruent to 1 modulo 7 is 1. Therefore, there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup, K, and it is normal in G.\n\nSince both H and K are normal subgroups of G, their intersection is trivial, i.e., H âˆ© K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Also, since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, the product of their orders is equal to the order of G: |H||K| = |G|. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 35, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
