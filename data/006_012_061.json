    "message_1": "In a neighborhood of 500 households, the probability of a burglary occurring in any given week is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 25 households will experience a burglary in a given week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (burglaries) in n trials (households)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the number of trials (households)\n- k is the number of successes (burglaries)\n- p is the probability of success (0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (0.95)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 25 households experiencing a burglary, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for 25, 26, 27, ..., 500 burglaries. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 24\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 24:\n\nΣ P(X = k) = Σ C(500, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(500-k) for k = 0 to 24\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use software or a calculator with a built-in binomial probability function. Using such a tool, we find:\n\nΣ P(X = k) ≈ 0.9804\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 25 households experiencing a burglary:\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) ≈ 1 - 0.9804 = 0.0196\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 households will experience a burglary in a given week is approximately 0.0196 or 1.96%."
