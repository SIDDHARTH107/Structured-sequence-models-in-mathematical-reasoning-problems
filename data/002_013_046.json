    "message_1": "What is the volume of a rectangular pyramid with a base of length 5 cm and width 8 cm, and a height of 10 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width:\n\nBase_area = length * width\nBase_area = 5 cm * 8 cm\nBase_area = 40 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\nVolume = (1/3) * 40 cm² * 10 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 400 cm³\nVolume = 133.33 cm³ (approximately)\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 133.33 cm³."
