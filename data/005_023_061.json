    "message_1": "A math student wants to determine whether there are any outliers in a dataset of 50 numbers. The mean of the dataset is 25 and the standard deviation is 5. The student decides to identify outliers by using the 1.5 x IQR rule. Using this method, what is the lower and upper limit for outliers in this dataset? Are there any outliers in the dataset?",
    "message_2": "To determine the lower and upper limits for outliers using the 1.5 x IQR rule, we first need to find the Interquartile Range (IQR). However, the given information only provides the mean and standard deviation, which are not sufficient to calculate the IQR directly. The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1) of the dataset.\n\nIf we had the IQR, we could calculate the lower and upper limits for outliers as follows:\n\nLower limit = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\nUpper limit = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\n\nUnfortunately, without the IQR or the actual dataset, we cannot determine the lower and upper limits for outliers using the 1.5 x IQR rule, nor can we identify any outliers in the dataset."
