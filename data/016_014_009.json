    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its length after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (4^n) / (3^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 12 iterations. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = (1) * (4^12) / (3^12)\n\nLength = (2^24) / (3^12)\n\nNow, we can calculate the length:\n\nLength ≈ 191,102.27 / 531,441\n\nLength ≈ 0.359841\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after 12 iterations is approximately 0.359841 units."
