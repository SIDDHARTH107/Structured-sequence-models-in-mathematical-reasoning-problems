    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first and second equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 1:\n\n(3x + 2y - z) * 4 = 7 * 4\n(2x - y + 4z) * 1 = 4 * 1\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n12x + 8y - 4z = 28\n2x - y + 4z = 4\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(12x + 8y - 4z) + (2x - y + 4z) = 28 + 4\n14x + 7y = 32\n\nNow, let's eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 2 and the third equation by 1:\n\n(3x + 2y - z) * 2 = 7 * 2\n(x + 3y + 2z) * 1 = 10 * 1\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n6x + 4y - 2z = 14\nx + 3y + 2z = 10\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(6x + 4y - 2z) + (x + 3y + 2z) = 14 + 10\n7x + 7y = 24\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\n14x + 7y = 32\n7x + 7y = 24\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(14x + 7y) - (7x + 7y) = 32 - 24\n7x = 8\n\nNow, divide by 7:\n\nx = 8 / 7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y using the second equation:\n\n7x + 7y = 24\n7(8/7) + 7y = 24\n8 + 7y = 24\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n7y = 16\n\nNow, divide by 7:\n\ny = 16 / 7\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can find the value of z using the third equation:\n\nx + 3y + 2z = 10\n(8/7) + 3(16/7) + 2z = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 7 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n8 + 48 + 14z = 70\n\nNow, subtract 56 from both sides:\n\n14z = 14\n\nNow, divide by 14:\n\nz = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 8/7\ny = 16/7\nz = 1"
