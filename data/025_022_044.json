Let F and G be objects in D(X) such that F ⊗ G ≅ O_X ⊕ O_X[1]. Find the dimensions of Hom(F,G) and Ext^1(F,G).",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimensions of Hom(F,G) and Ext^1(F,G), we will use the derived category formalism and the Serre duality on the curve X.\n\nFirst, let's compute Hom(F,G). By definition, Hom(F,G) = Hom(F,G[0]) = Hom(F,G) in the derived category. Since F ⊗ G ≅ O_X ⊕ O_X[1], we have:\n\nHom(F,G) = Hom(F, F^* ⊗ (O_X ⊕ O_X[1])) = Hom(F, F^* ⊗ O_X) ⊕ Hom(F, F^* ⊗ O_X[1]).\n\nNow, we use the adjunction formula:\n\nHom(F, F^* ⊗ O_X) = Hom(F ⊗ F^*, O_X) = Hom(O_X ⊕ O_X[1], O_X).\n\nBy the definition of the derived category, we have Hom(O_X ⊕ O_X[1], O_X) = Hom(O_X, O_X) = k, and Hom(O_X[1], O_X) = 0. Therefore, Hom(F,G) has dimension 1.\n\nNext, let's compute Ext^1(F,G). By definition, Ext^1(F,G) = Hom(F,G[1]) in the derived category. Using the same argument as before, we have:\n\nExt^1(F,G) = Hom(F, F^* ⊗ (O_X ⊕ O_X[1]))[1] = Hom(F, F^* ⊗ O_X)[1] ⊕ Hom(F, F^* ⊗ O_X[1])[1].\n\nUsing the adjunction formula again, we get:\n\nExt^1(F,G) = Hom(F ⊗ F^*, O_X[1]) = Hom(O_X ⊕ O_X[1], O_X[1]).\n\nIn this case, we have Hom(O_X, O_X[1]) = 0 and Hom(O_X[1], O_X[1]) = k. Therefore, Ext^1(F,G) has dimension 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the dimensions of Hom(F,G) and Ext^1(F,G) are both 1."
