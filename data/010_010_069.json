    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find its derivative f'(x) and set it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx = 1, 3\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points using Morse theory. To do this, we will find the second derivative f''(x) and evaluate it at the critical points.\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nAt x = 1:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the critical point x = 1 is a local maximum.\n\nAt x = 3:\n\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point x = 3 is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 has two critical points: x = 1 (local maximum) and x = 3 (local minimum)."
