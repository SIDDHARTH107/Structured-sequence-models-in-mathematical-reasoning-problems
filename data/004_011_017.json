If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when it is 16 feet from the ground?\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and related rates. Let x be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. The ladder's length is constant at 20 feet.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 20^2\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t):\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, so dx/dt = 2 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt when y = 16 feet.\n\nWhen y = 16 feet, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the corresponding value of x:\n\nx^2 + 16^2 = 20^2\nx^2 = 20^2 - 16^2\nx^2 = 144\nx = 12 feet\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(12)(2) + 2(16)(dy/dt) = 0\n\n48 + 32(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dt:\n\n32(dy/dt) = -48\ndy/dt = -48 / 32\ndy/dt = -1.5 ft/s\n\nSo, when the top of the ladder is 16 feet from the ground, it is sliding down the wall at a rate of 1.5 feet per second."
