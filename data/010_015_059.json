    "message_2": "To find the first De Rham cohomology group of the plane with a hole of radius 2 centered at the origin, we will first define the space and then compute the cohomology group.\n\nLet X be the punctured plane, i.e., X = ℝ² - {0}, where {0} is the origin. We will compute the first De Rham cohomology group H¹(X) of this space.\n\nRecall that the De Rham cohomology groups are defined as the quotient of the closed forms by the exact forms. In this case, we are interested in the 1-forms.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closed 1-forms on X. A 1-form ω is closed if dω = 0. The most general 1-form on X can be written as:\n\nω = f(x, y) dx + g(x, y) dy,\n\nwhere f and g are smooth functions on X. The condition dω = 0 implies that ∂f/∂y = ∂g/∂x.\n\nNow, let's consider the exact 1-forms on X. A 1-form ω is exact if there exists a 0-form (i.e., a function) φ such that ω = dφ. In this case, we have:\n\nf(x, y) = ∂φ/∂x and g(x, y) = ∂φ/∂y.\n\nSince X has a hole of radius 2 centered at the origin, we can use polar coordinates (r, θ) to describe X. In polar coordinates, we can write the 1-form ω as:\n\nω = h(r, θ) dr + k(r, θ) dθ,\n\nwhere h and k are smooth functions on X. The condition dω = 0 implies that ∂h/∂θ = ∂k/∂r.\n\nNow, we can find the closed 1-forms that are not exact. Consider the 1-form:\n\nω = dθ = (1/r) (xdy - ydx).\n\nThis form is closed since dω = 0. However, it is not exact because there is no function φ such that ω = dφ. This is because the integral of ω along a closed curve around the origin is nonzero.\n\nTherefore, the first De Rham cohomology group H¹(X) is generated by the closed 1-form dθ, and we have:\n\nH¹(X) ≅ ℝ.\n\nSo, the first De Rham cohomology group of the plane with a hole of radius 2 centered at the origin is isomorphic to the real numbers ℝ."
