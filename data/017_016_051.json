    "message_2": "Let H = ⟨a⟩ be the cyclic subgroup generated by a. Since a has order 3, we know that H = {e, a, a^2}, where e is the identity element in G. Now, we want to show that a has exactly 9 powers in G.\n\nSince G is a group of order 27, by the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G divides 27/3 = 9, and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G is either 1 or 9.\n\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup of G, then H is the unique 3-Sylow subgroup, and all elements of order 3 in G are in H. In this case, a has exactly 3 powers in G: e, a, and a^2.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are 9 distinct 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Let H_1, H_2, ..., H_9 be these 3-Sylow subgroups, and let H_1 = H = ⟨a⟩. Since the 3-Sylow subgroups are all of order 3, they are all cyclic and generated by an element of order 3. Let b_i be the generator of H_i for i = 2, 3, ..., 9.\n\nNow, consider the powers of a in G. We have a, a^2, a^3 = e, a^4 = a, a^5 = a^2, and so on. Notice that the powers of a are exactly the elements of H. Since a is not in any other 3-Sylow subgroup (by the distinctness of the 3-Sylow subgroups), the powers of a are not in any H_i for i = 2, 3, ..., 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the powers of a*b_2 in G. We have (a*b_2), (a*b_2)^2, (a*b_2)^3 = e, (a*b_2)^4 = a*b_2, (a*b_2)^5 = (a*b_2)^2, and so on. Notice that the powers of a*b_2 are exactly the elements of the form a*b_2^j for j = 0, 1, 2. Since a*b_2 is not in any other 3-Sylow subgroup (by the distinctness of the 3-Sylow subgroups), the powers of a*b_2 are not in any H_i for i = 3, 4, ..., 9.\n\nRepeating this process for a*b_3, a*b_4, ..., a*b_9, we find that the powers of a in G are exactly the elements of the form a*b_i^j for i = 1, 2, ..., 9 and j = 0, 1, 2. Since there are 9 choices for i and 3 choices for j, there are a total of 9 * 3 = 27 elements in G of this form. However, we have counted the identity element e = a^3 = a*b_i^3 for each i, so we have overcounted by 8. Thus, there are 27 - 8 = 19 elements of the form a*b_i^j in G.\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the elements of the form b_i^j for i = 2, 3, ..., 9 and j = 0, 1, 2, as these are not powers of a. There are 8 choices for i and 3 choices for j, giving a total of 8 * 3 = 24 such elements. However, we have counted the identity element e = b_i^3 for each i, so we have overcounted by 7. Thus, there are 24 - 7 = 17 elements of the form b_i^j in G.\n\nTherefore, the number of powers of a in G is 19 - 17 = 2, which is the number of non-identity elements in H. Adding the identity element e, we find that a has exactly 9 powers in G."
