    "message_2": "Let $G$ be a group of order $35$. Since $35 = 5 \\cdot 7$, where $5$ and $7$ are prime numbers, we can apply Sylow's Theorems to analyze the possible structure of $G$.\n\nFirst, let $n_5$ and $n_7$ be the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups and Sylow $7$-subgroups of $G$, respectively. By Sylow's Theorems, we have:\n\n1. $n_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ and $n_5 \\mid 7$, so $n_5 = 1$ or $n_5 = 7$.\n2. $n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ and $n_7 \\mid 5$, so $n_7 = 1$ or $n_7 = 5$.\n\nWe will now show that $n_5 = n_7 = 1$. Suppose, for contradiction, that $n_5 = 7$. Then there are $7$ distinct Sylow $5$-subgroups, each of order $5$. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow $5$-subgroups is trivial, there are $7 \\cdot (5-1) = 28$ elements of order $5$ in $G$. Similarly, if $n_7 = 5$, there are $5 \\cdot (7-1) = 30$ elements of order $7$ in $G$. But this would mean there are $28 + 30 = 58$ non-identity elements in $G$, which is a contradiction since $G$ has only $34$ non-identity elements. Therefore, we must have $n_5 = n_7 = 1$.\n\nLet $P_5$ and $P_7$ be the unique Sylow $5$-subgroup and Sylow $7$-subgroup of $G$, respectively. Since $n_5 = n_7 = 1$, both $P_5$ and $P_7$ are normal in $G$. Moreover, $P_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$ and $P_7 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_7$, as they are both cyclic groups of prime order.\n\nNow, consider the product $P_5P_7 = \\{ab \\mid a \\in P_5, b \\in P_7\\}$. Since $P_5$ and $P_7$ are both normal in $G$, we have $P_5P_7 \\leq G$. Moreover, $|P_5P_7| = \\frac{|P_5||P_7|}{|P_5 \\cap P_7|} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 7}{1} = 35$, as $P_5 \\cap P_7 = \\{e\\}$ (the trivial subgroup). Thus, $P_5P_7 = G$.\n\nWe claim that $G \\cong P_5 \\times P_7$. To see this, note that for any $a \\in P_5$ and $b \\in P_7$, we have $ab = ba$. Indeed, since $P_5$ and $P_7$ are normal in $G$, we have $aba^{-1}b^{-1} \\in P_5 \\cap P_7 = \\{e\\}$. Thus, $ab = ba$. This implies that $G$ is the internal direct product of $P_5$ and $P_7$, and so $G \\cong P_5 \\times P_7 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_7$.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two possible groups of order $35$: the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_{35}$ and the direct product $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_7$."
