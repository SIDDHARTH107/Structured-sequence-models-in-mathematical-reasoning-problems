    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x + 7 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\n1. Differentiate the first term: 4x^3\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2. So, the derivative of 4x^3 is 4 * 3x^2 = 12x^2.\n\n2. Differentiate the second term: 2x\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x is 1. So, the derivative of 2x is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n3. Differentiate the third term: 7\nThe derivative of a constant is 0. So, the derivative of 7 is 0.\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 + 2 + 0\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x + 7 is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 + 2"
