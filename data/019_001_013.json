    "message_2": "No, John is not eating pizza.\n\nLet's use propositional logic to justify the answer. We can represent the given proposition as follows:\n\nP: John eats pizza.\nQ: John is happy.\n\nThe given proposition is \"If P, then Q\" or P → Q, which is true.\n\nWe are also given that John is not happy, which means ¬Q is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if John is eating pizza (P) or not (¬P).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we know that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P is also true.\n\nSince ¬Q is true, we can conclude that ¬P is true, which means John is not eating pizza."
