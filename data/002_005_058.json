    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism in centimeters ?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 6 cm, and the height is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal = √(8² + 6² + 5²)\nDiagonal = √(64 + 36 + 25)\nDiagonal = √(125)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √(125) cm, which is approximately 11.18 cm."
