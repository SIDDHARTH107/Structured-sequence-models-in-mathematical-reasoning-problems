    "message_1": "A company that produces rectangular boxes has a fixed amount of cardboard. The length of the box is 3 times the height and the width is equal to the height. The company wants to maximize the volume of the box. If they have 600 square inches of cardboard, what should be the dimensions of the box to maximize its volume? Solve the problem using calculus.",
    "message_2": "Let the height of the box be h, the width be w, and the length be l. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:\n\nl = 3h\nw = h\n\nThe surface area of the box is given by the formula:\n\nA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nWe know that the company has 600 square inches of cardboard, so:\n\n600 = 2(3h)(h) + 2(3h)(h) + 2(h)(h)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n600 = 6h^2 + 6h^2 + 2h^2\n600 = 14h^2\n\nNow, we can find the height:\n\nh^2 = 600 / 14\nh^2 = 42.857\nh ≈ 6.545\n\nNow we can find the width and length:\n\nw = h ≈ 6.545\nl = 3h ≈ 19.636\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that maximize its volume with 600 square inches of cardboard are approximately:\n\nHeight: 6.545 inches\nWidth: 6.545 inches\nLength: 19.636 inches"
