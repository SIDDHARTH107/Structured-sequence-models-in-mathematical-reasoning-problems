    "message_1": "A trucking company needs to transport goods from city A to city D passing through cities B and C. The distance between each city is as follows: A to B is 100 km, B to C is 150 km, C to D is 200 km. The fuel cost for the truck is $2.50 per km. What is the optimal route for the truck to take to minimize the fuel cost? Assume that the truck's fuel consumption is constant on all roads.",
    "message_2": "Since the truck needs to pass through all the cities in order (A to B, B to C, and C to D), there is only one route to take: A → B → C → D. The total distance of this route is 100 km + 150 km + 200 km = 450 km. \n\nTo calculate the fuel cost for this route, we can use the given fuel cost per km:\n\nFuel cost = Distance × Cost per km\nFuel cost = 450 km × $2.50/km\nFuel cost = $1125\n\nSo, the optimal route for the truck to take is A → B → C → D, and the total fuel cost for this route is $1125."
