    "message_2": "A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Similarly, B × A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are different. In A × B, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set A, while in B × A, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set B. Therefore, A × B ≠ B × A."
