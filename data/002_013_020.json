    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 10 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 8 cm * 6 cm * 10 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 480 cubic cm\n\nVolume = 160 cubic cm\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is approximately 160 cubic centimeters."
