    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. A safe prime is a prime number of the form 2p + 1, where p is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a safe prime, we can start by listing the first few Sophie Germain primes and their corresponding safe primes:\n\n1. p = 2, 2p + 1 = 5 (Sophie Germain prime, but not a safe prime)\n2. p = 3, 2p + 1 = 7 (Sophie Germain prime, but not a safe prime)\n3. p = 5, 2p + 1 = 11 (Sophie Germain prime, but not a safe prime)\n4. p = 11, 2p + 1 = 23 (Sophie Germain prime, but not a safe prime)\n5. p = 23, 2p + 1 = 47 (Sophie Germain prime and a safe prime)\n\nThe smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a safe prime is 23."
