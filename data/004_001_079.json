    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 3, we will first find the derivative with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3) + d/dx (2x^2) - d/dx (5x) - d/dx (3)\n\nUsing the power rule for derivatives (d/dx (x^n) = nx^(n-1)), we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 + 4(2) - 5\nf'(2) = 3(4) + 8 - 5\nf'(2) = 12 + 8 - 5\nf'(2) = 15\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 3 at x = 2 is 15."
