    "message_1": "Suppose we have a moduli space of algebraic curves that consist of all smooth plane quartic curves. If we add one singular quartic curve to this moduli space, how many nodal curves are needed to keep the moduli space smooth?",
    "message_2": "To answer this question, we need to consider the dimension of the moduli space of smooth plane quartic curves and the dimension of the space of singular quartic curves with nodes.\n\nThe moduli space of smooth plane quartic curves has dimension 3(4+1)-10 = 5, where 3 is the number of coefficients in a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4, 4+1 is the number of monomials in a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4, and 10 is the dimension of the projective linear group PGL(3) acting on the space of quartic curves.\n\nNow, let's consider the space of singular quartic curves with nodes. A nodal curve is a curve with a single ordinary double point (a node). The condition for a quartic curve to have a node is that its partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z vanish simultaneously at some point. This gives us three equations in the coefficients of the quartic curve, so the space of nodal quartic curves has dimension 3(4+1)-10-3 = 2.\n\nWhen we add one singular quartic curve to the moduli space of smooth plane quartic curves, we are adding a 2-dimensional space to a 5-dimensional space. To keep the moduli space smooth, we need to add enough nodal curves to fill the 2-dimensional space of singular quartic curves with nodes.\n\nSince each nodal curve contributes a 1-dimensional subspace to the space of singular quartic curves with nodes, we need to add 2 nodal curves to keep the moduli space smooth."
