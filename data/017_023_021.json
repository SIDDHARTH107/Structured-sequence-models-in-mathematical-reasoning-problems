    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we need to consider the prime factorization of 72 and the possible ways to construct groups from those factors. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nWe can use the formula for the number of distinct groups of order p^n * q^m, where p and q are prime numbers, and n and m are their respective powers:\n\nf(p^n * q^m) = (1 + n) * (1 + m)\n\nIn our case, p = 2, n = 3, q = 3, and m = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nf(2^3 * 3^2) = (1 + 3) * (1 + 2) = 4 * 3 = 12\n\nHowever, this formula assumes that the Sylow p-subgroups are cyclic, which is not always the case. In the case of order 72, there are two additional non-isomorphic groups that can be formed by considering a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. These are the generalized quaternion group and the dicyclic group.\n\nTaking these additional groups into account, the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72 is 12 + 2 = 14."
