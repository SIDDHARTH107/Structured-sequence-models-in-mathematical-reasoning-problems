    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes and n+1 pigeons, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this case, the pigeonholes are the colors of the drinks (red, blue, and green), and the pigeons are the 6 people at the party. Since there are 3 pigeonholes (colors) and 6 pigeons (people), by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one color must be chosen by at least ⌈6/3⌉ = 2 people.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: One color is chosen by at least 3 people.\nIn this case, we have three people who each have a drink of the same color, which satisfies the condition.\n\nCase 2: Each color is chosen by exactly 2 people.\nIn this case, let's pick one person with a red drink (Person A), one person with a blue drink (Person B), and one person with a green drink (Person C). Now, consider the remaining three people. If any of them have a drink of a different color than A, B, or C, then we have three people who each have a drink of a different color. If all of them have drinks of the same color as A, B, or C, then we have three people who each have a drink of the same color.\n\nIn both cases, we have either three people who each have a drink of the same color or three people who each have a drink of a different color."
