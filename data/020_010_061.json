Each product is created from two materials, X and Y. To produce one unit of product A, the factory needs 2 units of material X and 1 unit of material Y. To produce one unit of product B, the factory needs 3 units of material X and 2 units of material Y. However, the quality of these materials can vary. For material X, the uncertain parameter λ can range from 0.8 to 1.2 and for material Y, the uncertain parameter ω can range from 0.9 to 1.1. The factory wants to maximize its profit under those uncertain parameters. What is the optimal production plan and what is the maximum profit that the factory can earn?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first define the variables and the objective function. Let x_A and x_B be the number of units produced for products A and B, respectively. The profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit = 10x_A + 20x_B - Cost\n\nThe cost function depends on the uncertain parameters λ and ω. We can write the cost function as:\n\nCost = (2λx_A + 3λx_B) * Cost_X + (ωx_A + 2ωx_B) * Cost_Y\n\nTo find the optimal production plan, we need to minimize the cost function while maximizing the profit function. We can do this by taking the partial derivatives of the profit function with respect to x_A and x_B and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂Profit/∂x_A = 10 - (2λ * Cost_X + ω * Cost_Y) = 0\n∂Profit/∂x_B = 20 - (3λ * Cost_X + 2ω * Cost_Y) = 0\n\nNow, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the uncertain parameters λ and ω. We can do this by finding the maximum cost function:\n\nMax_Cost = (2 * 1.2 * x_A + 3 * 1.2 * x_B) * Cost_X + (1.1 * x_A + 2 * 1.1 * x_B) * Cost_Y\n\nSubstitute the Max_Cost back into the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x_A + 20x_B - Max_Cost\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations:\n\n10 - (2 * 1.2 * Cost_X + 1.1 * Cost_Y) = 0\n20 - (3 * 1.2 * Cost_X + 2 * 1.1 * Cost_Y) = 0\n\nSolve for Cost_X and Cost_Y:\n\nCost_X = (10 - 1.1 * Cost_Y) / (2 * 1.2)\nCost_Y = (20 - 2 * 1.1 * Cost_X) / (3 * 1.2)\n\nNow, we can find the optimal production plan by solving for x_A and x_B:\n\nx_A = (10 - 1.1 * Cost_Y) / (2 * 1.2 * Cost_X)\nx_B = (20 - 2 * 1.1 * Cost_X) / (3 * 1.2 * Cost_Y)\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum profit by substituting the optimal production plan back into the profit function:\n\nMax_Profit = 10 * x_A + 20 * x_B - Max_Cost\n\nThe optimal production plan and the maximum profit will depend on the specific costs of materials X and Y. By plugging in the costs for materials X and Y, you can find the optimal production plan (x_A and x_B) and the maximum profit."
