    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of a matrix. We will perform 5 iterations starting with an initial approximation of [1, 1]. \n\nLet's denote the initial approximation as x_0 = [1, 1]. \n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = A * x_0 = [[5, -2], [2, -1]] * [1, 1] = [3, 1]\nNormalize x_1: x_1 = [3/√10, 1/√10] ≈ [0.948, 0.316]\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = A * x_1 ≈ [[5, -2], [2, -1]] * [0.948, 0.316] ≈ [3.790, 1.264]\nNormalize x_2: x_2 ≈ [3.790/√15.56, 1.264/√15.56] ≈ [0.965, 0.322]\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 = A * x_2 ≈ [[5, -2], [2, -1]] * [0.965, 0.322] ≈ [3.931, 1.310]\nNormalize x_3: x_3 ≈ [3.931/√16.62, 1.310/√16.62] ≈ [0.966, 0.323]\n\nIteration 4:\nx_4 = A * x_3 ≈ [[5, -2], [2, -1]] * [0.966, 0.323] ≈ [3.975, 1.322]\nNormalize x_4: x_4 ≈ [3.975/√16.90, 1.322/√16.90] ≈ [0.967, 0.323]\n\nIteration 5:\nx_5 = A * x_4 ≈ [[5, -2], [2, -1]] * [0.967, 0.323] ≈ [3.993, 1.326]\nNormalize x_5: x_5 ≈ [3.993/√17.00, 1.326/√17.00] ≈ [0.967, 0.323]\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the eigenvector approximation is [0.967, 0.323]. To find the dominant eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nλ = (x_5^T * A * x_5) / (x_5^T * x_5) ≈ ([0.967, 0.323] * [[5, -2], [2, -1]] * [0.967, 0.323]) / ([0.967, 0.323] * [0.967, 0.323])\n\nλ ≈ (3.993) / (0.967^2 + 0.323^2) ≈ 3.993 / (0.935 + 0.104) ≈ 3.993 / 1.039\n\nλ ≈ 3.843\n\nThus, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately 3.843, and its corresponding eigenvector is approximately [0.967, 0.323]. Both values are rounded to 3 decimal places."
