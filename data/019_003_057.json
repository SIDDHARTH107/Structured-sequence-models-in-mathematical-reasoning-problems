    "message_2": "In a modal language with 3 propositional variables (p, q, and r), each variable can take on one of two truth values: true (T) or false (F). To determine the number of possible worlds in this system, we need to consider all the possible combinations of truth values for these variables.\n\nFor each of the 3 variables, there are 2 possible truth values. So, the total number of possible worlds can be calculated as follows:\n\n2 (truth values for p) × 2 (truth values for q) × 2 (truth values for r) = 2³ = 8\n\nTherefore, there are 8 possible worlds in this modal language system with 3 propositional variables."
