    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point located at (2, 3, 4) meters away from the wire in the y-direction, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field B at a point P due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire is carrying a current in the x-direction, the differential length vector dl can be written as:\n\ndl = dx * i\n\nwhere dx is a small segment of the wire in the x-direction, and i is the unit vector in the x-direction.\n\nThe position vector r from the current element to the point P can be written as:\n\nr = (x - 0) * i + (3 - 0) * j + (4 - 0) * k = x * i + 3 * j + 4 * k\n\nNow, we can compute the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (dx * i) x (x * i + 3 * j + 4 * k) = dx * (-3 * k + 4 * j)\n\nNext, we can compute the magnitude of the position vector r:\n\n|r| = sqrt(x^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(x^2 + 25)\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (-3 * dx * k + 4 * dx * j)) / (x^2 + 25)^(3/2)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at the point P, we need to integrate dB over the entire length of the wire. Since the wire has a length of 10 meters in the x-direction, we need to integrate from x = 0 to x = 10:\n\nB = ∫(dB) from 0 to 10\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫((-3 * dx * k + 4 * dx * j) / (x^2 + 25)^(3/2)) from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we can separate the integral into two components, one for the j-direction and one for the k-direction:\n\nB_j = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫((4 * dx) / (x^2 + 25)^(3/2)) from 0 to 10\nB_k = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫((-3 * dx) / (x^2 + 25)^(3/2)) from 0 to 10\n\nTo solve these integrals, we can use a substitution method. Let u = x^2 + 25, then du = 2x * dx:\n\nB_j = (μ₀ * I / 8π) * ∫(du / u^(3/2)) from u = 25 to u = 125\nB_k = (-3 * μ₀ * I / 8π) * ∫(du / u^(3/2)) from u = 25 to u = 125\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\n\nB_j = (μ₀ * I / 8π) * [-2 / sqrt(u)] from 25 to 125\nB_k = (-3 * μ₀ * I / 8π) * [-2 / sqrt(u)] from 25 to 125\n\nB_j = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (1 / sqrt(125) - 1 / sqrt(25))\nB_k = (-3 * μ₀ * I / 4π) * (1 / sqrt(125) - 1 / sqrt(25))\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of μ₀ and I:\n\nB_j = (4π × 10^-7 * 5 / 4π) * (1 / sqrt(125) - 1 / sqrt(25))\nB_k = (-3 * 4π × 10^-7 * 5 / 4π) * (1 / sqrt(125) - 1 / sqrt(25))\n\nB_j = (5 × 10^-7) * (1 / sqrt(125) - 1 / sqrt(25))\nB_k = (-15 × 10^-7) * (1 / sqrt(125) - 1 / sqrt(25))\n\nB_j ≈ 2.0 × 10^-7 T\nB_k ≈ -6.0 × 10^-7 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point (2, 3, 4) meters away from the wire in the y-direction is approximately:\n\nB ≈ 2.0 × 10^-7 T * j - 6.0 × 10^-7 T * k"
