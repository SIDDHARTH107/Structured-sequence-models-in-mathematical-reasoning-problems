    "message_1": "Suppose an investor has a portfolio of two stocks. The expected returns and standard deviations of the stocks are as follows:\n\nStock A: Expected Return = 0.10, Standard Deviation = 0.20\n\nStock B: Expected Return = 0.15, Standard Deviation = 0.30\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the two stocks is 0.5. If the investor wants to allocate 60% of the portfolio to Stock A and the rest to Stock B, what is the expected return and standard deviation of the portfolio?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected return and standard deviation of the portfolio, we can use the following formulas:\n\nExpected Return of Portfolio (ERp) = (Weight of Stock A * Expected Return of Stock A) + (Weight of Stock B * Expected Return of Stock B)\n\nStandard Deviation of Portfolio (SDp) = √[(Weight of Stock A)^2 * (Standard Deviation of Stock A)^2 + (Weight of Stock B)^2 * (Standard Deviation of Stock B)^2 + 2 * (Weight of Stock A) * (Weight of Stock B) * (Standard Deviation of Stock A) * (Standard Deviation of Stock B) * Correlation Coefficient]\n\nGiven the weights of the stocks in the portfolio:\n\nWeight of Stock A = 0.6\nWeight of Stock B = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected return and standard deviation of the portfolio:\n\nERp = (0.6 * 0.10) + (0.4 * 0.15)\nERp = 0.06 + 0.06\nERp = 0.12 or 12%\n\nSDp = √[(0.6)^2 * (0.20)^2 + (0.4)^2 * (0.30)^2 + 2 * (0.6) * (0.4) * (0.20) * (0.30) * 0.5]\nSDp = √[0.0144 + 0.0144 + 0.0144]\nSDp = √[0.0432]\nSDp ≈ 0.2079 or 20.79%\n\nSo, the expected return of the portfolio is 12%, and the standard deviation of the portfolio is approximately 20.79%."
