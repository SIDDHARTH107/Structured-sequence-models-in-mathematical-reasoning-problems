    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the optimal solution to a problem by iteratively updating the positions of fireflies based on the attractiveness of other fireflies and random movements. However, as a mathematician, I cannot execute the algorithm directly. Instead, I will provide you with the steps to perform the Firefly Algorithm for the given problem.\n\n1. Initialize the fireflies: Create a population of 20 fireflies with their initial positions as x1 = -1, x2 = 0, and x3 = 2. You can generate the remaining 17 fireflies randomly within a reasonable range, e.g., between -10 and 10.\n\n2. Calculate the fitness: Evaluate the fitness of each firefly using the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 1. The fitness value represents the brightness of the firefly.\n\n3. Sort the fireflies: Sort the fireflies based on their fitness values in ascending order, as we are looking for the minimum value of f(x).\n\n4. Update the positions: For each firefly, compare its fitness with the fitness of all other fireflies. If a firefly has a better fitness (i.e., lower f(x) value), update the position of the current firefly towards the better firefly using the attraction coefficient and mutation coefficient.\n\n5. Check for the stopping criterion: If the maximum number of iterations (50) is reached, stop the algorithm. Otherwise, go back to step 2.\n\n6. Return the best solution: After the algorithm stops, the firefly with the best fitness value represents the minimum value of f(x).\n\nPlease note that the Firefly Algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the results may vary depending on the random movements and initial positions of the fireflies. To get a more accurate result, you can run the algorithm multiple times and take the average of the best solutions."
