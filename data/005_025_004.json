    "message_2": "A standard six-sided dice has six faces, numbered 1 through 6. To find the probability of rolling a 5 or a 6, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 5 or a 6) and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nThere are 2 successful outcomes (rolling a 5 or a 6) and 6 possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 5 or a 6 is:\n\nP(5 or 6) = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a 5 or a 6 on a standard six-sided dice is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (rounded to four decimal places)."
