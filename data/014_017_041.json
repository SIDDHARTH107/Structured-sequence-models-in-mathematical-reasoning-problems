    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot determine the most frequent letter in a message encrypted using a substitution cipher without any additional information about the message or the cipher used. The frequency of letters in an encrypted message depends on the original message's content and the specific substitution cipher applied. If you provide more information, I would be happy to help you solve the problem."
