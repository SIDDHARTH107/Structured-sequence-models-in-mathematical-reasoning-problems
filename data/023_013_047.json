Given the thermal diffusivity of the rod to be 0.1 cm²/s, find the temperature distribution in the rod at t = 15 s using the Fourier transform method for solving heat transfer problems.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution in the rod at t = 15 s using the Fourier transform method, we need to solve the one-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity (0.1 cm²/s in this case).\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\nT(0, t) = 100°C\nT(10, t) = 0°C\n\nWe can solve this problem using the method of separation of variables. Assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation and dividing by XT, we get:\n\n(1/T) ∂T/∂t = (α/X) ∂²X/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -λ²:\n\n(1/T) ∂T/∂t = -λ²\n(α/X) ∂²X/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n∂T/∂t = -λ²T\n∂²X/∂x² = -(λ²/α)X\n\nThe general solution for the time-dependent equation is:\n\nT(t) = A e^(-λ²t)\n\nThe general solution for the position-dependent equation is:\n\nX(x) = B cos(√(λ²/α)x) + C sin(√(λ²/α)x)\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = X(0)T(t) = 100 => X(0) = 100\nT(10, t) = X(10)T(t) = 0\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, we get B = 100. The second boundary condition gives:\n\n100 cos(√(λ²/α)10) + C sin(√(λ²/α)10) = 0\n\nSince cos(0) = 1 and sin(0) = 0, we have:\n\n100 cos(√(λ²/α)10) = 100\n\nThis implies that √(λ²/α)10 = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, λ_n = nπ/10√α.\n\nNow we can write the general solution as a sum of the individual solutions:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [A_n e^(-λ_n²t) (100 cos(λ_n x) + C_n sin(λ_n x))]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n and C_n, we need the initial temperature distribution, which is not given in the problem. However, we can still express the temperature distribution in the rod at t = 15 s in terms of these coefficients:\n\nT(x, 15) = Σ [A_n e^(-λ_n²(15)) (100 cos(λ_n x) + C_n sin(λ_n x))]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution in the rod at t = 15 s using the Fourier transform method for solving heat transfer problems."
