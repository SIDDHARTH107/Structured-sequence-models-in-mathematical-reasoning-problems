    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = √(4 + 9 + 1) = √14\n|B| = √(1^2 + (-5)^2 + 4^2) = √(1 + 25 + 16) = √42\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A||B|cos(θ)\n\nThe dot product of A and B is:\n\nA · B = (2)(1) + (3)(-5) + (-1)(4) = 2 - 15 - 4 = -17\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A||B|) = (-17) / (√14√42)\n\nNow, we can find the sine of the angle using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - cos^2(θ)\n\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (-17/√(14*42))^2)\n\nNow, we can find the cross product:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nTo find the unit vector n, we can use the right-hand rule. The cross product of A and B will be a vector perpendicular to both A and B. We can find the components of the cross product by taking the determinant of the following matrix:\n\n|   i      j      k  |\n|   2      3     -1  |\n|   1     -5      4  |\n\nA x B = (3 * 4 - (-1) * (-5))i - (2 * 4 - (-1) * 1)j + (2 * (-5) - 3 * 1)k\nA x B = (12 - 5)i - (8 + 1)j + (-10 - 3)k\nA x B = 7i - 9j - 13k\n\nSo, the cross product of A and B is:\n\nA x B = <7, -9, -13>"
