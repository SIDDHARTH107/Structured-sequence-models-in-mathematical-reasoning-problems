    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question a math student can solve:\n\nA force of 50 N is used to move an object horizontally a distance of 10 meters. The force is applied at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal. Find the work done on the object using integration. (Assume that the coefficient of kinetic friction is negligible and the force is constant.)",
    "message_2": "To find the work done on the object, we need to calculate the horizontal component of the force and then multiply it by the distance the object is moved. Since the force is applied at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal, we can use the cosine function to find the horizontal component of the force.\n\nThe horizontal component of the force (F_horizontal) can be calculated as follows:\n\nF_horizontal = F * cos(θ)\n\nwhere F is the force (50 N) and θ is the angle (45 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ (in radians) = (45 * π) / 180 = π / 4\n\nNow, we can calculate the horizontal component of the force:\n\nF_horizontal = 50 * cos(π / 4) = 50 * (√2 / 2) = 25√2 N\n\nSince the force is constant and the coefficient of kinetic friction is negligible, we can use the formula for work done:\n\nWork = F_horizontal * distance\n\nwhere distance is the distance the object is moved (10 meters).\n\nWork = 25√2 N * 10 m = 250√2 J\n\nSo, the work done on the object is 250√2 Joules."
