    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B x A) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, both (A x B) U (B x A) and (B x A) U (A x B) result in the same set. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. To show that the Cartesian product is not commutative, we need to compare A x B and B x A themselves:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, A x B ≠ B x A, which means that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative. The union operation does not affect the commutativity of the Cartesian product, as it is a separate operation applied after the Cartesian product has been calculated."
