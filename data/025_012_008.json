    "message_2": "We are given three points (0,1), (1,1), and (4,-4) that lie on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. We can use these points to form a system of equations to solve for a and b.\n\nFor point (0,1):\n1^2 = 0^3 + a(0) + b\n1 = b\n\nFor point (1,1):\n1^2 = 1^3 + a(1) + b\n1 = 1 + a + 1\na = -1\n\nFor point (4,-4):\n(-4)^2 = 4^3 + a(4) + b\n16 = 64 - 4 + 1\n16 = 61\n\nHowever, this last equation is not true. It seems there is a mistake in the given points or the elliptic curve does not pass through all three points. Please check the points and try again."
