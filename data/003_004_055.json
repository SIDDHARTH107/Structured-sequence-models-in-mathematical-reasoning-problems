    "message_2": "To find all solutions of the equation sin(x) = 1/2 in the interval [0, 2𝜋], we need to find the angles x for which the sine function equals 1/2.\n\nWe know that sin(𝜋/6) = 1/2 and sin(5𝜋/6) = 1/2. These are the two angles in the interval [0, 𝜋] that have a sine value of 1/2. Since the sine function has a period of 2𝜋, we can find the other solutions in the interval [𝜋, 2𝜋] by adding 2𝜋 to each of these angles:\n\nsin(𝜋/6 + 2𝜋) = sin(𝜋/6 + 12𝜋/6) = sin(13𝜋/6) = 1/2\nsin(5𝜋/6 + 2𝜋) = sin(5𝜋/6 + 12𝜋/6) = sin(17𝜋/6) = 1/2\n\nSo, the solutions of the equation sin(x) = 1/2 in the interval [0, 2𝜋] are:\n\nx = 𝜋/6, 5𝜋/6, 13𝜋/6, 17𝜋/6"
