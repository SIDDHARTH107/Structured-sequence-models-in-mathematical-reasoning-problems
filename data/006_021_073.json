    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a severe storm in a given month)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of months)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of months with a severe storm)\n\nFor this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (since we are considering the next 5 months)\n- k = 2 (since we want to find the probability of exactly 2 severe storms)\n- p = 0.3 (since there is a 30% chance of a severe storm in any given month)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(5, 2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 months out of 5:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!)\n         = 5! / (2! * 3!)\n         = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n         = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)\n         = 10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=2) = C(5, 2) * p^2 * (1-p)^(5-2)\n       = 10 * (0.3)^2 * (1-0.3)^(5-2)\n       = 10 * (0.3)^2 * (0.7)^3\n       = 10 * 0.09 * 0.343\n       â‰ˆ 0.3087\n\nSo, the probability that the region will experience a severe storm in exactly 2 out of the next 5 months is approximately 30.87%."
