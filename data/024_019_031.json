    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total curvature of a closed surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic of the surface. For a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2.\n\nTotal curvature = 2π * Euler characteristic\n\nFor a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2:\n\nTotal curvature = 2π * 2\n\nTotal curvature = 4π\n\nNow, we know that the total curvature of a sphere is also equal to the surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nSurface area = 4π * radius^2\n\nWe are given that the radius of the sphere S is 3 units:\n\nSurface area = 4π * (3^2)\n\nSurface area = 4π * 9\n\nSurface area = 36π\n\nSince the total curvature is equal to the surface area, the total curvature of the sphere S is 36π."
