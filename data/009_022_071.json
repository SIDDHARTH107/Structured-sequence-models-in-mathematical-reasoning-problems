    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the steady-state solution of the reaction-diffusion equation, which is when $u_t = 0$. This gives us the following equation:\n\n$$ 0 = u_{xx} + u(1-u)(u-a). $$\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $a$ such that after time $T=5$ units, the rod has two regions of equal length, one where the concentration of the substance is less than or equal to $0.5$ and the other where the concentration is larger than $0.5$. In other words, we want to find $a$ such that $u(x,5) = 0.5$ when $x = L/2 = 5$.\n\nTo do this, we can first try to find an expression for $u(x,t)$ by solving the steady-state equation. Since the equation is nonlinear, it is difficult to find an exact solution. However, we can make an educated guess for the form of the solution and then solve for $a$.\n\nLet's assume that the solution has the form:\n\n$$ u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x-5)}} $$\n\nwhere $k$ is a constant. This function has the property that $u(5,t) = 0.5$ for all $t$, and it approaches $0$ and $1$ as $x$ goes to $0$ and $L$, respectively.\n\nNow, we can plug this expression into the steady-state equation and solve for $a$. First, we need to compute the second derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$$ u_x = \\frac{ke^{-k(x-5)}}{(1 + e^{-k(x-5)})^2} $$\n\n$$ u_{xx} = \\frac{k^2e^{-k(x-5)}(1-e^{-k(x-5)})}{(1 + e^{-k(x-5)})^3} $$\n\nNow, substitute $u$ and $u_{xx}$ into the steady-state equation:\n\n$$ 0 = \\frac{k^2e^{-k(x-5)}(1-e^{-k(x-5)})}{(1 + e^{-k(x-5)})^3} + \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x-5)}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x-5)}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x-5)}}-a\\right) $$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$ 0 = k^2e^{-k(x-5)}(1-e^{-k(x-5)}) + (1-u)(u-a) $$\n\nNow, we can plug in $x=5$ and $u(5,t)=0.5$:\n\n$$ 0 = k^2e^0(1-e^0) + (1-0.5)(0.5-a) $$\n\n$$ 0 = k^2 + 0.5(0.5-a) $$\n\nSince we want to find the value of $a$, we can solve for $a$ in terms of $k$:\n\n$$ a = 0.5 - \\frac{k^2}{2} $$\n\nNow, we need to find a value of $k$ that satisfies the boundary conditions $u(0,t)=u(L,t)=1$. Plugging in $x=0$ and $x=L$ into the expression for $u(x,t)$, we get:\n\n$$ u(0,t) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(0-5)}} = 1 $$\n\n$$ u(L,t) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(10-5)}} = 1 $$\n\nSolving for $k$ in either equation gives us:\n\n$$ k = \\pm\\infty $$\n\nSince we are looking for a positive value of $k$, we can take the limit as $k$ goes to infinity:\n\n$$ \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} a = 0.5 - \\frac{k^2}{2} = 0.5 $$\n\nThus, the value of $a$ that satisfies the given conditions is $a = 0.5$."
