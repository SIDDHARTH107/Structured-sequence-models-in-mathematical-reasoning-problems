    "message_1": "A researcher collects a sample of 25 test scores from a population with an unknown mean and standard deviation. The sample mean is 85 and the sample standard deviation is 10. Using the bootstrap method, calculate a 90% confidence interval for the population mean.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 90% confidence interval for the population mean using the bootstrap method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000) from the original sample with replacement.\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n3. Arrange the bootstrap sample means in ascending order.\n4. Determine the 5th and 95th percentiles of the bootstrap sample means, which will be the lower and upper bounds of the 90% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the original sample data, we can't perform the bootstrap method directly. However, we can approximate the confidence interval using the t-distribution, which is a common method for small sample sizes.\n\n1. Calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean: SE = sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size) = 10 / sqrt(25) = 2.\n2. Determine the t-score for a 90% confidence interval with 24 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1): t ≈ 1.711 (using a t-table or calculator).\n3. Calculate the margin of error (ME): ME = t * SE = 1.711 * 2 ≈ 3.422.\n4. Calculate the lower and upper bounds of the 90% confidence interval: lower bound = sample mean - ME = 85 - 3.422 ≈ 81.578; upper bound = sample mean + ME = 85 + 3.422 ≈ 88.422.\n\nSo, the approximate 90% confidence interval for the population mean using the t-distribution method is (81.578, 88.422). Note that the bootstrap method would likely give slightly different results, but this approximation should be reasonably close."
