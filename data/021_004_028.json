What is the numerical value of the first derivative using this method? Also, compute the error in the approximation by comparing it with the exact value of the derivative at x = pi/4.",
    "message_2": "To compute the first derivative of f(x) = cos(x) using the forward difference formula, we use the following formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere h is the step size, which is given as 0.1. We want to compute the derivative at x = pi/4.\n\nFirst, let's calculate f(x + h) and f(x):\n\nf(x) = cos(pi/4) = √2 / 2\nf(x + h) = cos(pi/4 + 0.1)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the forward difference formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (cos(pi/4 + 0.1) - √2 / 2) / 0.1\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (-0.677281571625741 - √2 / 2) / 0.1 ≈ -0.740261\n\nNow, let's compute the exact value of the derivative at x = pi/4. The derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), so:\n\nf'(pi/4) = -sin(pi/4) = -√2 / 2 ≈ -0.707107\n\nFinally, let's compute the error in the approximation:\n\nError = |Approximate value - Exact value| = |-0.740261 - (-0.707107)| ≈ 0.033154\n\nSo, the numerical value of the first derivative using the forward difference formula is approximately -0.740261, and the error in the approximation is approximately 0.033154."
