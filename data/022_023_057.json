    "message_1": "Sure, here's a complex analysis numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the wave equation u_{tt} -4u_{xx} = 0, where x and t are real variables. Find the solution of the equation with initial conditions u(x,0) = x and u_t(x,0) = 0.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation with the initial conditions, we can use the method of d'Alembert's formula. The wave equation is given by:\n\nu_{tt} - 4u_{xx} = 0\n\nwith initial conditions:\n\nu(x, 0) = x\nu_t(x, 0) = 0\n\nThe d'Alembert's formula for the solution of the wave equation is:\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2)[f(x + ct) + f(x - ct)] + (1/2c)∫(x-ct)^(x+ct) g(s) ds\n\nwhere c is the wave speed, f(x) represents the initial displacement, and g(x) represents the initial velocity. In our case, c = 2, f(x) = x, and g(x) = 0.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2)[x + 2t + x - 2t] + (1/4)∫(x-2t)^(x+2t) 0 ds\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2)[2x] + 0\n\nu(x, t) = x\n\nSo, the solution to the wave equation with the given initial conditions is u(x, t) = x."
