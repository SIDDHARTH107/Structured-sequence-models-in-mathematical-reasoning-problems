    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of $f(x) = |\\cos(x)|$, we first need to compute the Fourier coefficients. Since $f(x)$ is an even function, we only need to compute the cosine coefficients, i.e., the $a_n$ coefficients. The formula for the $a_n$ coefficients is given by:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\cos(nx) dx$$\n\nFor $n = 0$, we have:\n\n$$a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} |\\cos(x)| dx = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos(x) dx = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos(x) dx = \\frac{2}{\\pi} [\\sin(x)]_{0}^{\\pi} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} (0) = 0$$\n\nFor $n \\geq 1$, we can split the integral into two parts, from $0$ to $\\pi$ and from $-\\pi$ to $0$:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[\\int_{-\\pi}^{0} -\\cos(x) \\cos(nx) dx + \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos(x) \\cos(nx) dx\\right]$$\n\nSince $\\cos(x)$ is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos(x) \\cos(nx) dx$$\n\nNow, we can use the product-to-sum formula:\n\n$$\\cos(A) \\cos(B) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A-B) + \\cos(A+B)]$$\n\nApplying this formula to our integral:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} [\\cos((n-1)x) + \\cos((n+1)x)] dx$$\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sin((n-1)x) + \\frac{1}{n+1}\\sin((n+1)x)\\right]_{0}^{\\pi}$$\n\nSince $\\sin(k\\pi) = 0$ for all integer values of $k$, we get:\n\n$$a_n = 0$$\n\nThus, the Fourier series of $f(x) = |\\cos(x)|$ is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\cos(nx) = 0$$\n\nHowever, this result is not correct, as the Fourier series does not converge pointwise to $f(x)$. This is because $f(x)$ is not smooth at $x = k\\pi$ for all integer values of $k$. In fact, the Fourier series converges to the function $g(x) = 0$, which is not equal to $f(x)$. Therefore, the Fourier series does not converge pointwise to $f(x)$."
