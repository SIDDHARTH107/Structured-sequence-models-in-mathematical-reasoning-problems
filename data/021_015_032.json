    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Here, we will use PSO to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = -x^2 + 5x + 6 over the interval [0, 6].\n\n1. Initialize the swarm: Create a population of particles with random positions and velocities within the search space [0, 6].\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle: Calculate the value of f(x) for each particle's position.\n\n3. Update the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) positions: If the current position of a particle has a better fitness value than its previous pbest, update its pbest. If a particle's pbest is better than the current gbest, update the gbest.\n\n4. Update the velocity and position of each particle: For each particle, update its velocity and position using the following equations:\n\n   - v_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * r1 * (pbest_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * r2 * (gbest - x_i(t))\n   - x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n\n   where:\n   - v_i(t) is the current velocity of particle i\n   - w is the inertia weight (e.g., 0.7)\n   - c1 and c2 are acceleration constants (e.g., 2)\n   - r1 and r2 are random numbers between 0 and 1\n   - pbest_i is the personal best position of particle i\n   - x_i(t) is the current position of particle i\n   - gbest is the global best position\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a sufficiently small change in gbest).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, the maximum value of the function f(x) will be the value of f(x) at the gbest position. Note that the PSO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the result may not be the exact maximum value but an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, you can find the maximum value of the function analytically by taking the derivative of f(x) and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = -2x + 5\n0 = -2x + 5\nx = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nNow, check the value of f(x) at the endpoints of the interval and at x = 2.5:\n\nf(0) = -0^2 + 5*0 + 6 = 6\nf(2.5) = -(2.5)^2 + 5*2.5 + 6 = 10.25\nf(6) = -6^2 + 5*6 + 6 = -12\n\nThe maximum value of the function f(x) = -x^2 + 5x + 6 over the interval [0, 6] is 10.25 at x = 2.5."
