    "message_1": "Consider the space curve C defined by the vector equation:\nr(t) = <3cos(t), 3sin(t), 4t>\n\nFind the curvature and torsion of the curve at t = π/2.",
    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the vector equation r(t).\n\nr(t) = <3cos(t), 3sin(t), 4t>\n\nFirst derivative:\nr'(t) = <-3sin(t), 3cos(t), 4>\n\nSecond derivative:\nr''(t) = <-3cos(t), -3sin(t), 0>\n\nNow, we need to find the unit tangent vector T(t) and its derivative T'(t). The unit tangent vector is given by:\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nAt t = π/2, we have:\n\nr'(π/2) = <-3sin(π/2), 3cos(π/2), 4> = <-3, 0, 4>\n\nNow, we find the magnitude of r'(π/2):\n\n||r'(π/2)|| = √((-3)^2 + 0^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = 5\n\nSo, the unit tangent vector T(π/2) is:\n\nT(π/2) = <-3/5, 0, 4/5>\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the unit tangent vector T'(t):\n\nT'(t) = (1/||r'(t)||) * r''(t)\n\nAt t = π/2, we have:\n\nr''(π/2) = <-3cos(π/2), -3sin(π/2), 0> = <0, -3, 0>\n\nSo, T'(π/2) = (1/5) * <0, -3, 0> = <0, -3/5, 0>\n\nNow we can find the curvature k(t) and torsion τ(t) at t = π/2.\n\nCurvature k(t) is given by:\n\nk(t) = ||T'(t)||\n\nAt t = π/2:\n\nk(π/2) = ||<0, -3/5, 0>|| = √(0^2 + (-3/5)^2 + 0^2) = 3/5\n\nSo, the curvature at t = π/2 is k(π/2) = 3/5.\n\nNow, let's find the torsion τ(t). We need the unit normal vector N(t) and the binormal vector B(t). The unit normal vector N(t) is given by:\n\nN(t) = T'(t) / ||T'(t)||\n\nAt t = π/2:\n\nN(π/2) = <0, -3/5, 0> / (3/5) = <0, -1, 0>\n\nThe binormal vector B(t) is given by:\n\nB(t) = T(t) x N(t)\n\nAt t = π/2:\n\nB(π/2) = <-3/5, 0, 4/5> x <0, -1, 0> = <0, 0, 3/5>\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the binormal vector B'(t):\n\nB'(t) = (dT/dt) x N + T x (dN/dt)\n\nAt t = π/2:\n\nB'(π/2) = <-3/5, 0, 4/5> x <0, -1, 0> = <0, 0, 0>\n\nFinally, the torsion τ(t) is given by:\n\nτ(t) = -B'(t) • N(t)\n\nAt t = π/2:\n\nτ(π/2) = -<0, 0, 0> • <0, -1, 0> = 0\n\nSo, the torsion at t = π/2 is τ(π/2) = 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the curvature of the curve at t = π/2 is 3/5, and the torsion is 0."
