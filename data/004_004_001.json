    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 from x = 0 to x = 2, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of f(x) is:\n\n∫(3x^2 - 4x + 5) dx\n\nTo integrate, we apply the power rule, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1):\n\n∫(3x^2) dx - ∫(4x) dx + ∫(5) dx\n\n= (3x^3)/3 - (4x^2)/2 + 5x + C\n\n= x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the limits x = 0 and x = 2:\n\nF(2) - F(0) = [(2^3) - 2(2^2) + 5(2)] - [(0^3) - 2(0^2) + 5(0)]\n\n= [(8 - 8 + 10)] - [0]\n\n= 10\n\nSo, the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 from x = 0 to x = 2 is 10 square units."
