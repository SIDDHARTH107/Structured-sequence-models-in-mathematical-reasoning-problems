The iterations refer to the number of times this replacement process is carried out.)",
    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using an L-system with the following rules:\n\nAxiom: A\nRules: A -> A-B--B+A++AA+B-\n           B -> +A-BB--B-A++A+B\n\nEach iteration of the Gosper curve replaces each line segment with a set of smaller segments, and the length of each new segment is 1/sqrt(2) times the length of the previous segment.\n\nLet's denote the length of the initial segment as L. The perimeter of the Gosper curve after each iteration can be calculated as follows:\n\nIteration 1: 6 * (L / sqrt(2))\nIteration 2: 6^2 * (L / (sqrt(2))^2)\nIteration 3: 6^3 * (L / (sqrt(2))^3)\nIteration 4: 6^4 * (L / (sqrt(2))^4)\nIteration 5: 6^5 * (L / (sqrt(2))^5)\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 5th iteration of the Gosper curve is:\n\nP = 6^5 * (L / (sqrt(2))^5)"
