The cost of production is given by the function p(x) = 5000x^2 - 10000x + 30000, where x is the number of units produced. The selling price of each unit is $250. The company wants to maximize profit. Use gradient descent method to find the optimum number of units to be produced and the maximum profit.\n\nNote: Assume that the fixed costs such as rent and salaries are already paid for and are not included in the cost of production.",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we first need to find the profit function. The profit function is given by the revenue function minus the cost function. The revenue function is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units produced, which is R(x) = 250x. The cost function is given as p(x) = 5000x^2 - 10000x + 30000. Therefore, the profit function P(x) is:\n\nP(x) = R(x) - p(x) = 250x - (5000x^2 - 10000x + 30000)\n\nSimplifying the profit function, we get:\n\nP(x) = -5000x^2 + 10250x - 30000\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the optimum number of units to be produced that maximizes the profit. First, we need to find the derivative of the profit function with respect to x:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = -10000x + 10250\n\nNext, we will choose an initial value for x, say x0 = 0, and set a learning rate, say α = 0.01. We will update the value of x using the gradient descent update rule:\n\nx_new = x_old - α * P'(x_old)\n\nWe will iterate this process until the change in x becomes very small or reaches a certain number of iterations. Let's set the maximum number of iterations to 1000 and the minimum change in x to 0.0001.\n\nx_old = 0\nfor i in range(1000):\n    x_new = x_old - 0.01 * (-10000 * x_old + 10250)\n    if abs(x_new - x_old) < 0.0001:\n        break\n    x_old = x_new\n\nAfter running the gradient descent algorithm, we get the optimum number of units to be produced as x_new. To find the maximum profit, we plug this value into the profit function:\n\nmax_profit = P(x_new)\n\nNow we have the optimum number of units to be produced and the maximum profit."
