    "message_1": "A company has ten available employees to fill five different job positions. In how many ways can they assign the employees to the five jobs?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 10 employees and 5 job positions, we want to find the number of ways to arrange 5 employees out of the 10 available.\n\nThis can be calculated using the formula for permutations:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nWhere n is the total number of items (employees) and r is the number of items to be arranged (job positions).\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and r = 5.\n\nP(10, 5) = 10! / (10 - 5)!\n\nP(10, 5) = 10! / 5!\n\nP(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nP(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) = 30,240\n\nSo, there are 30,240 ways to assign the 10 employees to the 5 job positions."
