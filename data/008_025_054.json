    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination. First, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the y variable:\n\nx + 2y + 3x - 2y = 5 + 4\n4x = 9\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 9/4\n\nNext, we can substitute the value of x back into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:\n\n(9/4) + 2y = 5\n\nNow, isolate y:\n\n2y = 5 - (9/4)\n2y = 11/4\n\nDivide by 2:\n\ny = (11/4) / 2\ny = 11/8\n\nSo, the solution to this system of linear equations is x = 9/4 and y = 11/8. In ordered pair notation, the solution is (9/4, 11/8)."
