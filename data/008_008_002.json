    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor, while each unit of product B requires 4 hours of machine time and 1 hour of labor. The company has 300 hours of machine time and 160 hours of labor available each day. If the profit for each unit of product A is $10 and the profit for each unit of product B is $15, what is the maximum daily profit the company can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced each day.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and labor are as follows:\n\nMachine time: 3x + 4y ≤ 300\nLabor: 2x + y ≤ 160\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nFor machine time: y ≤ (300 - 3x) / 4\nFor labor: y ≤ (160 - 2x)\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by plotting these inequalities on a graph:\n\n1. For the machine time constraint, the line is y = (300 - 3x) / 4. The feasible region is below this line.\n2. For the labor constraint, the line is y = (160 - 2x). The feasible region is below this line.\n\nThe feasible region is the area below both lines, and since x and y must be non-negative (we can't produce a negative number of units), the feasible region is in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane.\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the points of intersection between the constraint lines and the axes:\n\n1. Intersection with the x-axis (y = 0): \n   For machine time: 0 = (300 - 3x) / 4 => x = 100\n   For labor: 0 = (160 - 2x) => x = 80\n   Points: (100, 0) and (80, 0)\n\n2. Intersection with the y-axis (x = 0):\n   For machine time: y = (300 - 3*0) / 4 => y = 75\n   For labor: y = (160 - 2*0) => y = 160\n   Points: (0, 75) and (0, 160)\n\n3. Intersection between the machine time and labor lines:\n   (300 - 3x) / 4 = (160 - 2x) => 300 - 3x = 640 - 8x => 5x = 340 => x = 68\n   y = (160 - 2*68) => y = 24\n   Point: (68, 24)\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are (100, 0), (80, 0), (0, 75), (0, 160), and (68, 24).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(100, 0) = 10*100 + 15*0 = $1000\n2. P(80, 0) = 10*80 + 15*0 = $800\n3. P(0, 75) = 10*0 + 15*75 = $1125\n4. P(0, 160) = 10*0 + 15*160 = $2400 (This point is not in the feasible region as it does not satisfy the machine time constraint)\n5. P(68, 24) = 10*68 + 15*24 = $680 + $360 = $1040\n\nThe maximum daily profit is $1125, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 75 units of product B."
