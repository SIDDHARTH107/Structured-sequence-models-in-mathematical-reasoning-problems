    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 7, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, for the given function:\n\n∫(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 7) dx = ∫(2x^3) dx + ∫(5x^2) dx - ∫(3x) dx + ∫(7) dx\n\nNow, we apply the power rule for each term:\n\n∫(2x^3) dx = (2/4)x^4 = (1/2)x^4 + C1\n∫(5x^2) dx = (5/3)x^3 + C2\n∫(3x) dx = (3/2)x^2 + C3\n∫(7) dx = 7x + C4\n\nNow, we combine the results:\n\n∫(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 7) dx = (1/2)x^4 + (5/3)x^3 - (3/2)x^2 + 7x + C\n\nwhere C = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 is the constant of integration."
