    "message_1": "Suppose you have to send a message to your friend using RSA encryption. Your friend's public key is (17, 29). You want to send the message \"HELLO\". Convert the message into numbers using the ASCII table (H=72, E=69, L=76, O=79). Encrypt the message using RSA encryption and show the steps involved in the process, including finding the encryption key, calculating the ciphertext, and writing the final encrypted message to be sent to your friend.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using RSA encryption, follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the message into numbers using the ASCII table:\n   H = 72, E = 69, L = 76, L = 76, O = 79\n\n2. Use your friend's public key (e, n) = (17, 29) for encryption.\n\n3. Calculate the ciphertext for each character using the formula:\n   C = M^e mod n\n   where M is the ASCII value of the character and C is the ciphertext.\n\n   For H (72):\n   C = 72^17 mod 29 = 25\n\n   For E (69):\n   C = 69^17 mod 29 = 14\n\n   For L (76):\n   C = 76^17 mod 29 = 20\n\n   For L (76) again:\n   C = 76^17 mod 29 = 20\n\n   For O (79):\n   C = 79^17 mod 29 = 13\n\n4. Write the final encrypted message as a sequence of numbers:\n   Encrypted message: 25, 14, 20, 20, 13\n\nNow, you can send this encrypted message (25, 14, 20, 20, 13) to your friend. They will use their private key to decrypt it and retrieve the original message \"HELLO\"."
