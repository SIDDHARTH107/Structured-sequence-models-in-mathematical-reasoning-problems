    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a ciphertext encrypted using a Hill cipher with a 2x2 matrix key. The ciphertext is \"HMSE\". Decrypt the message using the Hill cipher and find the plaintext message. The Hill cipher uses modular arithmetic over the 26-letter English alphabet.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Hill cipher, we need to find the inverse of the 2x2 matrix key. However, the key is not given in the problem. Without the key, it is impossible to decrypt the message. Please provide the key to proceed with the decryption."
