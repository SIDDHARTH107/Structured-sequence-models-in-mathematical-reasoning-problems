    "message_2": "To compute the amplitude and phase angle of the 3rd harmonic component of a square wave signal, we can use the Fourier series representation of the square wave. The Fourier series of a square wave with frequency f and peak amplitude A can be expressed as:\n\nx(t) = A * Σ [(1/n) * sin(2πnft + φ_n)] for all odd n\n\nwhere n is the harmonic number, and φ_n is the phase angle of the nth harmonic component.\n\nFor the 3rd harmonic component (n = 3), we can compute the amplitude and phase angle as follows:\n\nAmplitude of the 3rd harmonic component:\nA_3 = A * (1/n) = 10 V * (1/3) = 10/3 V ≈ 3.33 V\n\nPhase angle of the 3rd harmonic component:\nSince the square wave is symmetric, the phase angle for all odd harmonics is 0 degrees or 0 radians.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the 3rd harmonic component is approximately 3.33 V, and the phase angle is 0 degrees or 0 radians."
