    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since the elements in set A and set B are all integers, we can define the universal set U as the set of all integers, or a subset of integers that includes all the elements in sets A and B. For simplicity, let's define the universal set U as the set of integers from 1 to 10:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. In other words, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}.\n\nUsing this definition, we can find the complement of set A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, to show that the complement of set A is unique, we need to prove that there cannot be another set that is also the complement of set A.\n\nLet's assume there is another set, C, that is also the complement of set A. This means that C contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. Since A' is already the complement of set A, this implies that C = A'.\n\nNow, let's consider an element x ∈ A'. Since x is in A', it must also be in C, as we assumed that C is also the complement of set A. Therefore, x ∈ C. Since this holds true for all elements in A', we can conclude that A' ⊆ C.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider an element y ∈ C. Since y is in C, it must also be in A', as we assumed that C is also the complement of set A. Therefore, y ∈ A'. Since this holds true for all elements in C, we can conclude that C ⊆ A'.\n\nSince A' ⊆ C and C ⊆ A', we can conclude that A' = C. This means that there cannot be another set that is also the complement of set A, as any such set would be equal to A'. Therefore, the complement of set A is unique."
