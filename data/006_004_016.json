    "message_1": "A student is playing a game at a carnival where they must select a numbered ball out of a barrel. There are 20 balls numbered 1 to 20, and the student wins if they select ball number 7. What is the probability that the student will win the game on their first attempt?",
    "message_2": "The probability of an event occurring is calculated by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, there is only 1 successful outcome (selecting ball number 7) and 20 possible outcomes (selecting any of the 20 balls).\n\nSo, the probability of the student winning the game on their first attempt is:\n\n1 (successful outcome) / 20 (total possible outcomes) = 1/20\n\nThe probability of the student winning on their first attempt is 1/20 or 0.05, which is equal to 5%."
