    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = t^2 + 2t + 3, we can use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nIn this case, f(t) = t^2 + 2t + 3. So, we need to find the Laplace transform of each term separately and then add them together.\n\n1. L{t^2}:\nL{t^2} = ∫(e^(-st) * t^2) dt, from 0 to infinity\nUsing integration by parts twice, we get:\nL{t^2} = 2! / s^3\n\n2. L{2t}:\nL{2t} = ∫(e^(-st) * 2t) dt, from 0 to infinity\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\nL{2t} = 2 / s^2\n\n3. L{3}:\nL{3} = ∫(e^(-st) * 3) dt, from 0 to infinity\nThis is a simple exponential integral, so we get:\nL{3} = 3 / s\n\nNow, we can add the Laplace transforms of each term together:\n\nF(s) = L{t^2} + L{2t} + L{3}\nF(s) = (2! / s^3) + (2 / s^2) + (3 / s)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = t^2 + 2t + 3 is:\n\nF(s) = 2/s^3 + 2/s^2 + 3/s"
