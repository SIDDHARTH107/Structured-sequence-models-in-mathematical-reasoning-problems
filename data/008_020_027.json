    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 2 -3  4 | 1\n| 1  2  3 | 0\n| 3  1 -1 | -2\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nWe'll use the first row as the pivot row. To eliminate x from the second row, we'll subtract (1/2) times the first row from the second row. To eliminate x from the third row, we'll subtract (3/2) times the first row from the third row.\n\n```\n|  2  -3   4 |  1\n|  0   3.5  1 | -0.5\n|  0   5.5 -7 | -3.5\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nWe'll use the second row as the pivot row. To eliminate y from the third row, we'll multiply the second row by (5.5/3.5) and subtract it from the third row.\n\n```\n|  2  -3   4 |  1\n|  0   3.5  1 | -0.5\n|  0   0  -6 | -3\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nNow we have a triangular matrix, so we can solve for z by dividing the third row by -6.\n\n```\n|  2  -3   4 |  1\n|  0   3.5  1 | -0.5\n|  0   0   1 |  0.5\n```\n\nSo, z = 0.5.\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find y and x.\n\nNow we'll back-substitute to find y and x. From the second row, we have:\n\n3.5y + 1z = -0.5\n3.5y = -0.5 - 0.5\ny = -1/3.5 = -2/7\n\nNow, from the first row, we have:\n\n2x - 3y + 4z = 1\n2x = 1 + 3(-2/7) - 4(0.5)\n2x = 1 + 6/7 - 2\n2x = (1/7)\nx = 1/14\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1/14, y = -2/7, z = 0.5"
