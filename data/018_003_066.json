    "message_2": "The union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set containing all elements that are in either set A or set B or in both. In this case, the union of sets A and B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's confirm that the resulting set is a superset of both sets A and B. A set C is considered a superset of set A if every element of A is also an element of C. Similarly, C is a superset of B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nFor set A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, all of its elements (1, 2, 3, and 4) are also elements of the union set A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Therefore, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nFor set B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, all of its elements (3, 4, 5, and 6) are also elements of the union set A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Therefore, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nSince A ∪ B is a superset of both sets A and B, we have confirmed the statement."
