    "message_1": "Consider the system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n4x + 6y = 16\n\nWhat is the solution of this system of equations?",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n2x + 3y = 8\n\nSince the two equations are the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. Therefore, this system of equations has infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line 2x + 3y = 8 is a solution. To express the solution set, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\n3y = -2x + 8\ny = (-2/3)x + 8/3\n\nSo the solution set is y = (-2/3)x + 8/3 for all values of x."
