The following table contains the data collected for 10 randomly selected employees:\n\n| Employee | Salary   | Experience (years) | Education Level | Performance Rating |\n|----------|----------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| 1        | $62,000 | 8                  | Bachelor's            | 3.2                       |\n| 2        | $58,000 | 5                  | Associate's             | 2.8                       |\n| 3        | $70,000 | 10               | Master's              | 3.9                       |\n| 4        | $50,000 | 2                  | High School           | 2.1                       |\n| 5        | $68,000 | 9                  | Bachelor's            | 3.6                       |\n| 6        | $75,000 | 12               | PhD                     | 4.2                       |\n| 7        | $55,000 | 4                  | Associate's             | 2.6                       |\n| 8        | $63,000 | 7                  | Bachelor's            | 3.3                       |\n| 9        | $67,000 | 8                  | Master's              | 3.8                       |\n| 10      | $48,000 | 1                  | High School           | 1.8                       |\n\nUsing multivariate analysis, determine the relationship (if any) between the salaries of the employees and their years of experience, level of education, and performance rating.",
    "message_2": "To analyze the relationship between the salaries of the employees and their years of experience, level of education, and performance rating, we can use a multiple linear regression model. First, we need to assign numerical values to the education levels:\n\nHigh School: 1\nAssociate's: 2\nBachelor's: 3\nMaster's: 4\nPhD: 5\n\nNow, we can create a dataset with the numerical values:\n\n| Employee | Salary   | Experience (years) | Education Level (Numerical) | Performance Rating |\n|----------|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| 1        | $62,000 | 8                  | 3                           | 3.2               |\n| 2        | $58,000 | 5                  | 2                           | 2.8               |\n| 3        | $70,000 | 10               | 4                           | 3.9               |\n| 4        | $50,000 | 2                  | 1                           | 2.1               |\n| 5        | $68,000 | 9                  | 3                           | 3.6               |\n| 6        | $75,000 | 12               | 5                           | 4.2               |\n| 7        | $55,000 | 4                  | 2                           | 2.6               |\n| 8        | $63,000 | 7                  | 3                           | 3.3               |\n| 9        | $67,000 | 8                  | 4                           | 3.8               |\n| 10      | $48,000 | 1                  | 1                           | 1.8               |\n\nWe will use the multiple linear regression model:\n\nSalary = b0 + b1 * Experience + b2 * Education_Level + b3 * Performance_Rating\n\nUsing statistical software or programming languages like R or Python, we can calculate the coefficients (b0, b1, b2, and b3) for the model. After calculating the coefficients, we can analyze the significance of each variable and the overall model fit (e.g., R-squared value) to determine the relationship between the variables and the salaries.\n\nNote: Due to the small sample size (only 10 employees), the results may not be very reliable. It is recommended to collect more data for a more accurate analysis."
