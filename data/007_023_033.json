    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many different messages can be created with 45 characters, where each character can be represented with 8 bits.\n\nSince there are 2^8 possible values for each character (because each character is represented by 8 bits), there are (2^8)^45 different possible messages.\n\nNow, let's find out how many different hash values can be generated by the cryptographic hash function. Since it generates a 160-bit hash value, there are 2^160 different possible hash values.\n\nTo find out how many different messages can have the same hash value, we need to divide the total number of possible messages by the total number of possible hash values:\n\nNumber of messages with the same hash value = (Number of possible messages) / (Number of possible hash values)\n\nNumber of messages with the same hash value = ((2^8)^45) / (2^160)\n\nNumber of messages with the same hash value = (2^(8*45)) / (2^160)\n\nNumber of messages with the same hash value = 2^(360-160)\n\nNumber of messages with the same hash value = 2^200\n\nSo, 2^200 different messages can have the same hash value."
