    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, 150 people being affected by the disease)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 1000 people)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 150 people being affected)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.12)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, 1 - 0.12 = 0.88)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 150) = C(1000, 150) * (0.12)^150 * (0.88)^(1000-150)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(1000, 150):\n\nC(1000, 150) = 1000! / (150!(1000-150)!)\nC(1000, 150) = 1000! / (150! * 850!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 150) = C(1000, 150) * (0.12)^150 * (0.88)^850\n\nCalculating this probability using a calculator or software (such as Python or Wolfram Alpha) gives:\n\nP(X = 150) â‰ˆ 0.0363\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 150 people from the demographic group will be affected by the disease is approximately 3.63%."
