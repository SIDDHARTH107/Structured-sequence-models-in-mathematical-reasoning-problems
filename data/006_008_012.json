    "message_2": "To find the probability of it raining for 3 consecutive days, we need to multiply the probability of it raining on each day. Since the probability of rain on any given day is 30% (0.30), the calculation is as follows:\n\n0.30 (day 1) * 0.30 (day 2) * 0.30 (day 3) = 0.027\n\nSo, the probability of it raining for 3 consecutive days is 2.7%."
