    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature, we first need to find the normal vector to the surface S at the point (1, 1, 1). We can do this by finding the gradient of the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3z.\n\n∇F(x, y, z) = (dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz) = (2x, 2y, 2z - 3)\n\nNow, we plug in the point (1, 1, 1) to find the normal vector at that point:\n\nN = ∇F(1, 1, 1) = (2, 2, -1)\n\nNext, we need to find the tangent vectors in the plane spanned by the given vectors (1, 0, -1) and (0, 1, -1). We can do this by projecting the given vectors onto the tangent plane, which is orthogonal to the normal vector N.\n\nLet u = (1, 0, -1) and v = (0, 1, -1). We can find the tangent vectors by subtracting the projection of u and v onto N from u and v, respectively.\n\nProjection of u onto N: ((u · N) / ||N||^2) * N = ((1, 0, -1) · (2, 2, -1)) / ||(2, 2, -1)||^2 * (2, 2, -1) = (1/3, 1/3, -2/3)\n\nProjection of v onto N: ((v · N) / ||N||^2) * N = ((0, 1, -1) · (2, 2, -1)) / ||(2, 2, -1)||^2 * (2, 2, -1) = (1/3, 1/3, -2/3)\n\nNow, we find the tangent vectors:\n\nT1 = u - projection of u onto N = (1, 0, -1) - (1/3, 1/3, -2/3) = (2/3, -1/3, -1/3)\nT2 = v - projection of v onto N = (0, 1, -1) - (1/3, 1/3, -2/3) = (-1/3, 2/3, -1/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the second fundamental form (also known as the shape operator) for the surface S. The second fundamental form is a quadratic form that measures how the surface bends. We can find the second fundamental form by taking the covariant derivative of the normal vector N with respect to the tangent vectors T1 and T2.\n\nLet's denote the second fundamental form as II(T1, T2). We can find this by taking the dot product of the covariant derivative of N with respect to T1 and T2.\n\nII(T1, T2) = (∇_T1 N) · T2\n\nSince we are working in Euclidean space, the covariant derivative is the same as the regular derivative. So, we can find the components of the covariant derivative of N with respect to T1 and T2.\n\n∇_T1 N = (dN/dx, dN/dy, dN/dz) * T1 = (2, 2, 2) * (2/3, -1/3, -1/3) = (4/3, -2/3, -2/3)\n\nNow, we can find II(T1, T2):\n\nII(T1, T2) = (4/3, -2/3, -2/3) · (-1/3, 2/3, -1/3) = (-4/9 + 4/9 + 2/9) = 2/9\n\nFinally, we can find the sectional curvature K by dividing the second fundamental form by the product of the magnitudes of the tangent vectors:\n\nK = II(T1, T2) / (||T1|| * ||T2||)\n\n||T1|| = sqrt((2/3)^2 + (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)^2) = sqrt(6/9) = sqrt(2/3)\n||T2|| = sqrt((-1/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 + (-1/3)^2) = sqrt(6/9) = sqrt(2/3)\n\nK = (2/9) / (2/3 * 2/3) = (2/9) / (4/9) = 1/2\n\nSo, the sectional curvature along the plane spanned by the vectors (1, 0, -1) and (0, 1, -1) at the point (1, 1, 1) is 1/2."
