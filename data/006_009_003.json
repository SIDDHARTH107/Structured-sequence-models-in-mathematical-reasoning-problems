    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected individual from this population has the medical condition, we can simply divide the number of individuals with the condition by the total population.\n\nNumber of individuals with the condition = 5% of 10,000 = 0.05 * 10,000 = 500\n\nProbability = (Number of individuals with the condition) / (Total population)\nProbability = 500 / 10,000 = 0.05 or 5%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this population has the medical condition is 5%."
