    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n4x + 6iy = 8 + 4i\n\n4x - 5y = 8i\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x:\n\n(4x + 6iy) - (4x - 5y) = (8 + 4i) - 8i\n\n6iy + 5y = 8 + 4i - 8i\n\nCombine the real and imaginary parts:\n\n(6i + 5)y = 8 - 4i\n\nNow, divide both sides by (6i + 5) to solve for y:\n\ny = (8 - 4i) / (6i + 5)\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator (6i - 5):\n\ny = [(8 - 4i)(6i - 5)] / [(6i + 5)(6i - 5)]\n\ny = [48i - 40 + 20i - 24i^2] / [36i^2 - 30i + 30i - 25]\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can simplify the expression:\n\ny = [48i - 40 + 20i + 24] / [-36 + 25]\n\ny = (68i - 16) / (-11)\n\ny = 16/11 - 68i/11\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3i(16/11 - 68i/11) = 4 + 2i\n\n2x + (48/11 - 204i/11) = 4 + 2i\n\n2x = (4 - 48/11) + (2i + 204i/11)\n\n2x = (4 - 48/11) + (2i + 204i/11)\n\n2x = (-4/11) + (218i/11)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = (-2/11) + (109i/11)\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = -2/11 + 109i/11\ny = 16/11 - 68i/11"
