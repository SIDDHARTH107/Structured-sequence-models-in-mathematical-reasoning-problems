    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2/x) + (5/x^2) = 1, we first want to get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD), which in this case is x^2.\n\nx^2 * (2/x) + x^2 * (5/x^2) = x^2 * 1\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x + 5 = x^2\n\nNow, we want to set the equation to 0 by moving all the terms to one side:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-5))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (2 ± √(4 + 20)) / 2\n\nx = (2 ± √24) / 2\n\nx = (2 ± 2√6) / 2\n\nNow, we can factor out the 2:\n\nx = 1 ± √6\n\nSo, the two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = 1 + √6\nx = 1 - √6"
