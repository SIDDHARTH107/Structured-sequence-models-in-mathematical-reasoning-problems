    "message_2": "To analyze the behavior of the network and determine the frequencies present in the system's output, we will first consider the modulation process. In this case, the signal is modulated using a sine wave with a frequency of 10,000 Hz. This is typically done using amplitude modulation (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). We will consider amplitude modulation for this problem.\n\nFor amplitude modulation, the modulated signal can be represented as:\n\ns(t) = (1 + m * sin(2 * pi * f_m * t)) * sin(2 * pi * f_c * t)\n\nwhere:\ns(t) is the modulated signal,\nm is the modulation index (0 < m < 1),\nf_m is the frequency of the message signal (2000 Hz),\nf_c is the frequency of the carrier signal (10,000 Hz), and\nt is time.\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier transform to analyze the behavior of the network and determine the frequencies present in the system's output. The Fourier transform of the modulated signal s(t) can be represented as:\n\nS(f) = ∫ s(t) * e^(-j * 2 * pi * f * t) dt\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to s(t) will yield the frequency components present in the modulated signal. Due to the modulation process, the modulated signal will have frequency components at the carrier frequency (f_c) and sidebands at (f_c ± f_m).\n\nIn this case, the carrier frequency is 10,000 Hz, and the message signal frequency is 2000 Hz. Therefore, the frequency components present in the system's output will be:\n\n1. Lower sideband: f_c - f_m = 10,000 Hz - 2000 Hz = 8,000 Hz\n2. Carrier frequency: f_c = 10,000 Hz\n3. Upper sideband: f_c + f_m = 10,000 Hz + 2000 Hz = 12,000 Hz\n\nSo, the frequencies present in the system's output are 8,000 Hz, 10,000 Hz, and 12,000 Hz."
