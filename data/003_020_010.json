    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall at a 60 degree angle. The bottom of the ladder is 6 feet away from the base of the wall. How long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the adjacent side (the side next to the angle) divided by the hypotenuse (the longest side, which is the ladder in this case).\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\ncos(60°) = adjacent side (6 feet) / hypotenuse (length of the ladder)\n\nWe know that cos(60°) = 0.5, so we can set up the equation:\n\n0.5 = 6 / length of the ladder\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of the ladder:\n\nlength of the ladder = 6 / 0.5\nlength of the ladder = 12 feet\n\nThe ladder is 12 feet long."
