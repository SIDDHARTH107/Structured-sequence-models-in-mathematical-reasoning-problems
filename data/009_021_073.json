    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation with the initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the PDE:\n\n∂u/∂t = 14∂^2u/∂x^2\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = 14∂^2X(x)/∂x^2 T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 14X(x)T(t):\n\n(1/14T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X(x))∂^2X(x)/∂x^2\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\n(1/14T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = -λ^2\n(1/X(x))∂^2X(x)/∂x^2 = -λ^2\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) ∂^2X(x)/∂x^2 + λ^2X(x) = 0, with boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0\n2) ∂T(t)/∂t + 14λ^2T(t) = 0\n\nSolve the first ODE for X(x):\n\nX(x) = A*sin(λx) + B*cos(λx)\n\nApply the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A*sin(0) + B*cos(0) = B = 0\nX(1) = A*sin(λ) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (trivial solution), sin(λ) must be zero. Thus, λ = nπ, where n is a positive integer. So, the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX_n(x) = A_n*sin(nπx)\n\nNow, solve the second ODE for T(t):\n\n∂T(t)/∂t + 14n^2π^2T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n*exp(-14n^2π^2t)\n\nThe general solution for u(x, t) is a sum of the product of X_n(x) and T_n(t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ[D_n*sin(nπx)*exp(-14n^2π^2t)]\n\nNow, apply the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(πx):\n\nsin(πx) = Σ[D_n*sin(nπx)*exp(0)]\n\nComparing both sides, we can see that D_1 = 1 and D_n = 0 for n > 1. Thus, the solution for u(x, t) is:\n\nu(x, t) = sin(πx)*exp(-14π^2t)\n\nNow, we can find the solution at t = 0.5s:\n\nu(x, 0.5) = sin(πx)*exp(-14π^2*0.5)\n\nFor the given interpolation points x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1:\n\nu(0, 0.5) = 0\nu(0.25, 0.5) = sin(π*0.25)*exp(-14π^2*0.5)\nu(0.5, 0.5) = sin(π*0.5)*exp(-14π^2*0.5)\nu(0.75, 0.5) = sin(π*0.75)*exp(-14π^2*0.5)\nu(1, 0.5) = 0"
