    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead transformation involves replacing a straight line segment with two segments of equal length, each of which is half the length of the original segment, and then connecting the endpoints of these two new segments with a third segment of equal length, forming an equilateral triangle without the base.\n\nLet's denote the number of line segments of length 1 cm in the resulting figure after the nth iteration as S_n. After the first iteration, the original 12 cm line segment is replaced by three segments of length 6 cm each. So, S_1 = 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nNow, let's find the general formula for S_n. Each iteration replaces each line segment with three segments of half the length. Therefore, the number of line segments in the resulting figure after the nth iteration is 3^n times the number of line segments in the original figure, and the length of each line segment after the nth iteration is (1/2)^n times the length of the original line segment.\n\nSo, S_n = 3^n * (12 / (2^n)).\n\nNow, we need to find S_8:\n\nS_8 = 3^8 * (12 / (2^8))\nS_8 = 6561 * (12 / 256)\nS_8 = 6561 * (3 / 64)\nS_8 = 3069\n\nAfter the 8th iteration, there would be 3069 line segments of length 1 cm in the resulting figure."
