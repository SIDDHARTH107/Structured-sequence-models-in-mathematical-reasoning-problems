    "message_2": "Proof: Let f: X -> Y be a continuous function, and let {k_n} be a sequence in X converging to x. We want to show that {f(k_n)} converges to f(x) in Y.\n\nSince f is continuous, for any open neighborhood V of f(x) in Y, there exists an open neighborhood U of x in X such that f(U) ⊆ V. Since {k_n} converges to x, there exists an integer N such that for all n ≥ N, k_n ∈ U. Then, for all n ≥ N, f(k_n) ∈ f(U) ⊆ V. This shows that {f(k_n)} converges to f(x) in Y.\n\nNow, let X = [0,1] with the standard topology, and let {k_n} be the sequence (1/n). Let f:[0,1] -> [0,1] be a continuous function defined by f(x) = x^2. We want to find the limit of the sequence {f(k_n)}.\n\nWe have k_n = 1/n, so f(k_n) = (1/n)^2 = 1/n^2. As n goes to infinity, 1/n^2 goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of the sequence {f(k_n)} is 0."
