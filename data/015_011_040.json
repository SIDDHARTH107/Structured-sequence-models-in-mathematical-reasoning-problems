    "message_2": "To find the maximum angle of deflection of the lower pendulum in a double pendulum system, we need to consider the equations of motion for the system. However, the equations of motion for a double pendulum are highly complex and nonlinear, which makes it difficult to find an analytical solution for the maximum angle of deflection.\n\nInstead, we can use numerical methods to approximate the maximum angle of deflection. One such method is to use a simulation of the double pendulum system and track the angle of the lower pendulum over time.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses the Runge-Kutta method to simulate the double pendulum system and find the maximum angle of deflection for the lower pendulum:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef double_pendulum_equations(y, t, L1, L2, m1, m2, g):\n    theta1, theta2, p1, p2 = y\n    cos_delta_theta = np.cos(theta1 - theta2)\n    sin_delta_theta = np.sin(theta1 - theta2)\n    \n    theta1_dot = (L2 * p1 - L1 * p2 * cos_delta_theta) / (L1**2 * L2 * (m1 + m2 * sin_delta_theta**2))\n    theta2_dot = (L1 * (m1 + m2) * p2 - L2 * m2 * p1 * cos_delta_theta) / (L1 * L2**2 * (m1 + m2 * sin_delta_theta**2))\n    p1_dot = -(m1 + m2) * g * L1 * np.sin(theta1) - p1 * theta1_dot * L2 * m2 * sin_delta_theta\n    p2_dot = -m2 * g * L2 * np.sin(theta2) + p1 * theta1_dot * L1 * (m1 + m2) * sin_delta_theta\n    \n    return [theta1_dot, theta2_dot, p1_dot, p2_dot]\n\ndef runge_kutta_step(y, t, dt, f, *args):\n    k1 = f(y, t, *args)\n    k2 = f(y + dt/2 * k1, t + dt/2, *args)\n    k3 = f(y + dt/2 * k2, t + dt/2, *args)\n    k4 = f(y + dt * k3, t + dt, *args)\n    \n    return y + dt/6 * (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)\n\ndef simulate_double_pendulum(L1, L2, m1, m2, g, theta1_init, theta2_init, t_max, dt):\n    y = [theta1_init, theta2_init, 0, 0]\n    t = 0\n    theta2_max = theta2_init\n    \n    while t < t_max:\n        y = runge_kutta_step(y, t, dt, double_pendulum_equations, L1, L2, m1, m2, g)\n        theta2_max = max(theta2_max, abs(y[1]))\n        t += dt\n    \n    return theta2_max\n\nL1 = 1\nL2 = 0.5\nm1 = 1\nm2 = 1\ng = 9.8\ntheta1_init = np.radians(10)\ntheta2_init = 0\nt_max = 10\ndt = 0.001\n\ntheta2_max = simulate_double_pendulum(L1, L2, m1, m2, g, theta1_init, theta2_init, t_max, dt)\nprint(\"Maximum angle of deflection of the lower pendulum (in degrees):\", np.degrees(theta2_max))\n```\n\nPlease note that this code snippet is for illustration purposes only and may not be optimized for performance or accuracy. The maximum angle of deflection found using this method is an approximation and may vary depending on the simulation parameters (e.g., time step size, simulation duration)."
