    "message_1": "A computer manufacturing company has 3 assembly lines with 7, 5 and 4 workers respectively. Each worker can produce 4, 5 and 6 computers in a day for assembly lines 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The company has a contract to produce a minimum of 220 computers each day. Determine the optimal number of workers to assign to each assembly line to meet the contract while minimizing the total number of workers.",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z be the number of workers assigned to assembly lines 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We need to find the values of x, y, and z that minimize the total number of workers while meeting the contract requirement of producing at least 220 computers per day.\n\nWe can set up the following inequality to represent the contract requirement:\n\n4x + 5y + 6z ≥ 220\n\nWe want to minimize the total number of workers, which can be represented by the following equation:\n\nx + y + z = W (where W is the total number of workers)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the inequality while minimizing W.\n\nFirst, we can try to find the minimum value of x, y, and z that satisfies the inequality:\n\n4x + 5y + 6z ≥ 220\n\nWe can start by setting x = 0 and solving for y and z:\n\n5y + 6z ≥ 220\n\nNow, we can try different values of y and z to find the minimum values that satisfy the inequality:\n\ny = 0: 6z ≥ 220, z ≥ 36.67 (not an integer value, so we need to try another value for y)\n\ny = 1: 5 + 6z ≥ 220, 6z ≥ 215, z ≥ 35.83 (not an integer value, so we need to try another value for y)\n\ny = 2: 10 + 6z ≥ 220, 6z ≥ 210, z ≥ 35 (integer value, so we can use this value for z)\n\nSo, the minimum values that satisfy the inequality are x = 0, y = 2, and z = 35. This gives us a total of 37 workers (W = x + y + z = 0 + 2 + 35 = 37).\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of workers to assign to each assembly line to meet the contract while minimizing the total number of workers is 0 workers for assembly line 1, 2 workers for assembly line 2, and 35 workers for assembly line 3."
