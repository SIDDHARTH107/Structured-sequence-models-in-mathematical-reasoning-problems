    "message_2": "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. It can be used to estimate the confidence interval for a population parameter, such as the mean. Here's how to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the average weight of fish in the pond using bootstrapping:\n\n1. Draw a random sample of 100 fish with replacement from the original dataset.\n2. Calculate the mean weight of the fish in the resampled dataset.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (e.g., 1000 or more) to create a distribution of resampled means.\n4. Calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of resampled means to obtain the 95% confidence interval.\n\nHowever, since we don't have the actual dataset of fish weights, we can't perform the bootstrapping procedure directly. Instead, we can use the given information to approximate the confidence interval using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\nThe CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. In this case, we have a sample size of 100, which is large enough to apply the CLT.\n\nGiven the average weight (mean) of 2.5 kg and the standard deviation of 0.4 kg, we can calculate the standard error (SE) of the mean:\n\nSE = (standard deviation) / sqrt(sample size)\nSE = 0.4 kg / sqrt(100)\nSE = 0.4 kg / 10\nSE = 0.04 kg\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) to approximate the 95% confidence interval. For a 95% confidence interval, we use the Z-score of 1.96, which corresponds to the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the standard normal distribution.\n\nLower limit = mean - (Z-score * SE)\nLower limit = 2.5 kg - (1.96 * 0.04 kg)\nLower limit = 2.5 kg - 0.0784 kg\nLower limit ≈ 2.4216 kg\n\nUpper limit = mean + (Z-score * SE)\nUpper limit = 2.5 kg + (1.96 * 0.04 kg)\nUpper limit = 2.5 kg + 0.0784 kg\nUpper limit ≈ 2.5784 kg\n\nTherefore, the approximate 95% confidence interval for the average weight of fish in the pond is (2.4216 kg, 2.5784 kg)."
