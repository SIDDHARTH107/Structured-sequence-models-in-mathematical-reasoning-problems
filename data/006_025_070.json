    "message_1": "A magic show has 12 different magic tricks that are performed randomly each time. What is the probability that a specific trick, Trick A, will be performed exactly 3 times in a 5-show performance?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of the event happening exactly x times\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as nCx or \"n choose x\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the 5-show performance)\n- x is the number of successful trials (in this case, Trick A being performed exactly 3 times)\n- p is the probability of success in a single trial (in this case, the probability of Trick A being performed in a single show)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure in a single trial (in this case, the probability of Trick A not being performed in a single show)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of Trick A being performed in a single show. Since there are 12 different magic tricks, and each trick has an equal chance of being performed, the probability of Trick A being performed in a single show is 1/12.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of combinations of 5 shows taken 3 at a time. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, x) = n! / (x!(n-x)!)\n\nwhere \"n!\" denotes the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n= 5! / (3!2!)\n= (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(2*1))\n= 120 / (6*2)\n= 120 / 12\n= 10\n\nNow we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(3) = C(5, 3) * (1/12)^3 * (11/12)^2\n= 10 * (1/12)^3 * (11/12)^2\n= 10 * (1/1728) * (121/144)\n= 10 * (121/248832)\n= 1210 / 248832\n\nThe probability of Trick A being performed exactly 3 times in a 5-show performance is approximately 1210 / 248832, or approximately 0.00486, or 0.486%."
