    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products - Product A and Product B. Each unit of A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while each unit of B requires 2 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The company has 2000 hours of labor and 3000 hours of machine time available. \nProduct A generates a profit of $20 per unit while Product B generates a profit of $30 per unit. \nHow many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabor: 3x + 2y ≤ 2000\nMachine time: 2x + 4y ≤ 3000\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nLabor: y ≤ (2000 - 3x) / 2\nMachine time: y ≤ (3000 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by plotting these inequalities on a coordinate plane. The feasible region is the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy both inequalities.\n\nNext, we will find the vertices of the feasible region. These are the points where the constraint lines intersect. We will solve the system of equations:\n\n1) x = (2000 - 2y) / 3\n2) y = (3000 - 2x) / 4\n\nSubstitute equation 1 into equation 2:\n\ny = (3000 - 2((2000 - 2y) / 3)) / 4\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = 375\n\nNow, substitute y back into equation 1 to find x:\n\nx = (2000 - 2(375)) / 3\nx = 416.67 (approximately)\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, we will consider producing 416 units of Product A and 375 units of Product B. To check if producing 417 units of Product A and 374 units of Product B would yield a higher profit, we will calculate the profit for both scenarios:\n\nP(416, 375) = 20(416) + 30(375) = $19,320\nP(417, 374) = 20(417) + 30(374) = $19,290\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved by producing 416 units of Product A and 375 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $19,320."
