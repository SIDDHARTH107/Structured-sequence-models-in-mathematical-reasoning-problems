    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t), then the Fourier transform of y''(t) is given by (-ω^2)Y(ω), and the Fourier transform of y(t) is Y(ω). Thus, the Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\n(-ω^2)Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) (-ω^2 + 4) = 0\n\nY(ω) = 0, for ω ≠ ±2\nY(ω) is undefined for ω = ±2\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get y(t). Since Y(ω) = 0 for ω ≠ ±2, the inverse Fourier transform will only have contributions from the undefined points at ω = ±2. We can represent Y(ω) as a sum of Dirac delta functions:\n\nY(ω) = Aδ(ω - 2) + Bδ(ω + 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω):\n\ny(t) = (1 / (2π)) ∫[Aδ(ω - 2) + Bδ(ω + 2)] e^(iωt) dω\n\nUsing the properties of the Dirac delta function, we can simplify the integral:\n\ny(t) = (A / (2π)) e^(2it) + (B / (2π)) e^(-2it)\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions to find A and B:\n\ny(0) = 2 = (A / (2π)) + (B / (2π))\ny'(0) = 3 = (2iA / (2π)) - (2iB / (2π))\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nA = π\nB = π\n\nThus, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = (π / (2π)) (e^(2it) + e^(-2it))\n\ny(t) = (1/2) (e^(2it) + e^(-2it))\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite the solution in terms of cosine:\n\ny(t) = cos(2t)"
