    "message_2": "To find the force required to drag the plate, we can use the drag force equation for a flat plate parallel to the flow:\n\nF = 0.5 * C_d * ρ * A * V^2\n\nwhere F is the drag force, C_d is the drag coefficient, ρ is the fluid density, A is the plate area, and V is the relative velocity between the plate and the fluid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relative velocity between the plate and the fluid. The plate is moving at 4 m/s in the positive x direction, while the fluid has a velocity component u = 2x in the x direction. Assuming the plate is at x = 1, the fluid velocity at the plate is u = 2(1) = 2 m/s. Therefore, the relative velocity V = 4 - 2 = 2 m/s.\n\nNext, we need to find the drag coefficient C_d. For a flat plate parallel to the flow, the drag coefficient is typically around 1.98. However, this value can vary depending on the Reynolds number and the surface roughness of the plate. For this problem, we will assume C_d = 1.98.\n\nNow we can calculate the drag force:\n\nF = 0.5 * 1.98 * 800 kg/m³ * 1 m² * (2 m/s)^2\nF = 0.99 * 800 * 1 * 4\nF = 3168 N\n\nTherefore, the force required to drag the 1m x 1m plate parallel to the x-y plane at a velocity of 4 m/s in the positive x direction is approximately 3168 N."
