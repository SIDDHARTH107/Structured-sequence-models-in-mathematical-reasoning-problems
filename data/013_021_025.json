    "message_1": "Suppose two players are playing a two-player Centipede game in which each player starts with $1. In each round, Player 1 can choose to either take the current amount of money and end the game or pass the turn to Player 2. If Player 1 passes, Player 2 can either take the current amount of money and end the game or pass the turn back to Player 1. The game continues in this way, with each player alternating turns and the amount of money doubling after each round until one player chooses to take the money. If the game ends on round 10, what is the total amount of money won?",
    "message_2": "In the Centipede game, the amount of money doubles after each round. If the game ends on round 10, we can calculate the total amount of money won by finding the value after 10 rounds of doubling.\n\nStarting with $1, we double the amount 10 times:\n\n1. $1 * 2 = $2\n2. $2 * 2 = $4\n3. $4 * 2 = $8\n4. $8 * 2 = $16\n5. $16 * 2 = $32\n6. $32 * 2 = $64\n7. $64 * 2 = $128\n8. $128 * 2 = $256\n9. $256 * 2 = $512\n10. $512 * 2 = $1024\n\nSo, if the game ends on round 10, the total amount of money won is $1024."
