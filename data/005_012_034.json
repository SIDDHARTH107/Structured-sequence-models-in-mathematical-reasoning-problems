    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum sample size needed, we can use the formula for the margin of error (E) in a confidence interval:\n\nE = Z * (σ / √n)\n\nwhere E is the margin of error, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for a 95% confidence interval), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nWe want to find the minimum sample size (n) needed to achieve a margin of error of 2. Rearranging the formula to solve for n:\n\nn = (Z * σ / E)^2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nn = (1.96 * 8 / 2)^2\nn = (7.84)^2\nn = 61.4656\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a sample, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the margin of error is no greater than 2:\n\nn = 62\n\nSo, the minimum sample size needed is 62."
