    "message_2": "An entire function is a function that is holomorphic (analytic) on the entire complex plane. Since f(z) is a polynomial, it is an entire function.\n\nThe number of zeros of an entire function is equal to the degree of the polynomial. In this case, the degree of the polynomial f(z) is 5 (the highest power of z is z^5). Therefore, the number of zeros of the entire function f(z) in the complex plane, counted with multiplicity, is 5."
