    "message_2": "To determine the possible values of the third Betti number b3(M), we can use Poincar√© duality, which states that for a closed, oriented manifold M of dimension n, the Betti numbers satisfy the following relationship:\n\nb_k(M) = b_{n-k}(M)\n\nIn our case, M is a 3-dimensional manifold, so we have:\n\nb3(M) = b_{3-3}(M) = b_0(M)\n\nThe zeroth Betti number, b0(M), counts the number of connected components of the manifold. Since M is a connected manifold, we have:\n\nb0(M) = 1\n\nTherefore, the possible value of the third Betti number b3(M) is:\n\nb3(M) = 1"
