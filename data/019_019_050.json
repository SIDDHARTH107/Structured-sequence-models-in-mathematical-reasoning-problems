    "message_2": "To design a finite state machine that accepts binary inputs in which the number of 0's is divisible by 3, we can use the following states:\n\n1. State A: Initial state, where the number of 0's seen so far is 0 (which is divisible by 3).\n2. State B: The number of 0's seen so far is 1 (not divisible by 3).\n3. State C: The number of 0's seen so far is 2 (not divisible by 3).\n\nNow, let's define the transitions between these states based on the input:\n\n- If the current state is A and the input is 0, the number of 0's becomes 1, so we move to state B.\n- If the current state is A and the input is 1, the number of 0's remains the same, so we stay in state A.\n- If the current state is B and the input is 0, the number of 0's becomes 2, so we move to state C.\n- If the current state is B and the input is 1, the number of 0's remains the same, so we stay in state B.\n- If the current state is C and the input is 0, the number of 0's becomes 3 (which is divisible by 3), so we move back to state A.\n- If the current state is C and the input is 1, the number of 0's remains the same, so we stay in state C.\n\nThe finite state machine will accept the input if it ends in state A, as this means the number of 0's is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, the minimum number of states required in a finite state machine that accepts binary inputs in which the number of 0's is divisible by 3 is 3 (states A, B, and C)."
