    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent, and they represent the same plane in three-dimensional space. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions for this system of linear equations, and we cannot find unique values for x, y, and z.\n\nHowever, we can express the solution in terms of a parameter. Let's solve the first equation for z:\n\nz = 2x + 4y - 10\n\nNow, we can introduce a parameter t:\n\ny = t\n\nThen, x can be expressed in terms of t:\n\nx = (z - 4t + 10) / 2\n\nSo, the general solution for this system of linear equations is:\n\nx = (z - 4t + 10) / 2\ny = t\nz = z\n\nwhere t and z can be any real numbers."
