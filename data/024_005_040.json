    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to find the normal vector, the shape operator, and the eigenvalues of the shape operator.\n\nThe given surface is a sphere with radius 3 centered at the origin. The equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\n1. Normal vector:\nThe gradient of the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 9 at the point (1, 2, √2) will give us the normal vector.\n∇F(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\n∇F(1, 2, √2) = (2, 4, 2√2)\n\n2. Shape operator:\nThe shape operator S is defined as the derivative of the normal vector with respect to the surface. We can find the shape operator by taking the gradient of the normal vector and evaluating it at the given point.\n\nS = -d(∇F)/dF\n\nThe partial derivatives of the normal vector components are:\n∂(2x)/∂x = 2, ∂(2x)/∂y = 0, ∂(2x)/∂z = 0\n∂(4y)/∂x = 0, ∂(4y)/∂y = 4, ∂(4y)/∂z = 0\n∂(2√2z)/∂x = 0, ∂(2√2z)/∂y = 0, ∂(2√2z)/∂z = 2√2\n\nSo, the shape operator S is given by the matrix:\nS = -[ [2, 0, 0],\n          [0, 4, 0],\n          [0, 0, 2√2] ]\n\n3. Eigenvalues:\nTo find the principal curvatures, we need to find the eigenvalues of the shape operator S.\n\nThe characteristic equation is given by:\ndet(S - λI) = 0\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n(2 - λ)((4 - λ)(2√2 - λ)) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 2, λ2 = 4, and λ3 = 2√2.\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, 2, √2) are 2, 4, and 2√2."
