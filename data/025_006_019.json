    "message_2": "To determine the number of solutions of the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_5$, we will use the Weil conjectures, which relate the number of points on an algebraic variety over a finite field to the cohomology of the variety.\n\nFirst, we compute the zeta function of the variety, which is given by\n$$Z(t) = \\exp\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{N_n}{n} t^n\\right),$$\nwhere $N_n$ is the number of solutions of the equation in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{F}_{5^n})$ up to projective equivalence.\n\nThe Weil conjectures tell us that the zeta function can be expressed in terms of the Betti numbers $b_i$ of the variety as follows:\n$$Z(t) = \\frac{P_1(t)P_3(t)\\cdots}{(1-t)P_0(t)P_2(t)\\cdots},$$\nwhere $P_i(t) = \\prod_{j=1}^{b_i} (1 - \\alpha_{i,j} t)$ and the $\\alpha_{i,j}$ are algebraic integers with complex absolute value $q^{i/2}$, where $q = 5$ in our case.\n\nFor a smooth projective surface in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we have the following Betti numbers: $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 0$, and $b_2 = 1$. Therefore, the zeta function takes the form\n$$Z(t) = \\frac{1}{(1-t)(1-\\alpha t)}.$$\n\nNow, we want to compute $N_1$, the number of solutions in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{F}_5)$. To do this, we can use the fact that $N_1 = 5^2 + 1 - \\alpha - \\overline{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\overline{\\alpha}$ are the roots of the polynomial $1 - \\alpha t$.\n\nWe can compute $N_1$ directly by counting the solutions in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{F}_5)$. For each non-zero element $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_5$, there are two other elements $b$ and $c$ such that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 0$. There are four choices for $a$, and for each choice of $a$, there are two choices for $b$ and $c$. This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ solutions. Additionally, we have the point $(0:0:1)$, which is also a solution. Therefore, $N_1 = 9$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\alpha$ and $\\overline{\\alpha}$:\n$$9 = 25 + 1 - \\alpha - \\overline{\\alpha} \\Rightarrow \\alpha + \\overline{\\alpha} = 17.$$\n\nSince $\\alpha$ and $\\overline{\\alpha}$ have complex absolute value $5^{1/2}$, we can write $\\alpha = 5^{1/2} e^{i\\theta}$ and $\\overline{\\alpha} = 5^{1/2} e^{-i\\theta}$. Then,\n$$17 = 5^{1/2} e^{i\\theta} + 5^{1/2} e^{-i\\theta} = 5^{1/2} (e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta}) = 5^{1/2} (2\\cos\\theta).$$\n\nSolving for $\\cos\\theta$, we get $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{17}{2\\cdot 5^{1/2}}$. Since $\\cos\\theta$ must be real, this implies that $\\alpha$ and $\\overline{\\alpha}$ are real numbers. Therefore, the number of solutions of the equation in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{F}_5)$ up to projective equivalence is $N_1 = 9$."
