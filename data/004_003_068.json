    "message_1": "A company wants to build a rectangular pen with an area of 100 square meters to contain their livestock. They have decided to use one side of their barn as part of the fence, so they need to build three sides of the pen. They want to minimize the amount of fencing used while still maintaining an area of 100 square meters. What should the dimensions of the rectangular pen be to achieve this?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the pen be L meters and the width be W meters. Since one side of the barn is used as part of the fence, we only need to build three sides of the pen. The area of the pen is given by:\n\nArea = L * W = 100 square meters\n\nWe want to minimize the amount of fencing used, which is the perimeter of the pen minus the side of the barn. The perimeter of the pen is given by:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2W\n\nTo minimize the perimeter, we can use calculus. First, we need to express either L or W in terms of the other variable using the area equation. Let's express L in terms of W:\n\nL = 100 / W\n\nNow, substitute this expression for L in the perimeter equation:\n\nPerimeter = (100 / W) + 2W\n\nTo find the minimum value of the perimeter, we can take the derivative of the perimeter with respect to W and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Perimeter)/dW = -100/W^2 + 2 = 0\n\nSolving for W:\n\n100/W^2 = 2\nW^2 = 100/2\nW^2 = 50\nW = sqrt(50)\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding value of L:\n\nL = 100 / W\nL = 100 / sqrt(50)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular pen that minimize the amount of fencing used while maintaining an area of 100 square meters are:\n\nL = 100 / sqrt(50) meters\nW = sqrt(50) meters"
