    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2 and 5 is a prime, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must divide the order of G and satisfy n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. However, since 25 ≡ 0 (mod 5), we must have n_5 = 1. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, P is a normal subgroup of G, since it is the only 5-Sylow subgroup.\n\nNow, we know that the order of P is 5, so P is a cyclic group of order 5, generated by some element a with a^5 = e (the identity element of G). Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/P. The order of G/P is |G|/|P| = 25/5 = 5, so G/P is also a cyclic group of order 5, generated by some coset bP with (bP)^5 = P.\n\nNow, consider the element b in G. Since (bP)^5 = P, we have b^5 ∈ P. If b^5 = e, then G would be generated by a and b, and G would be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. If b^5 ≠ e, then b^5 must be some power of a, say b^5 = a^k for some integer k. Since b^5 ∈ P, we have (b^5)^5 = a^(5k) = e, so a^(25k) = e. Since the order of a is 5, we must have 25k ≡ 0 (mod 5), so k ≡ 0 (mod 5). Thus, k = 5l for some integer l, and b^5 = a^(5l) = (a^5)^l = e^l = e.\n\nIn either case, we have shown that G is generated by a and b, with a^5 = b^5 = e. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, as required."
