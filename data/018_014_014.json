    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of two sets, we need to find all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a is from set A and b is from set B. Let's first find A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A x B, denoted as (A x B) x̄. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the given set. Since we are dealing with Cartesian products, we need to consider the universal set U x V, where U is the universal set for A and V is the universal set for B. Let's assume U = {1, 2} and V = {3, 4} for simplicity. Then, U x V = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\n(A x B) x̄ = U x V - A x B = ∅ (empty set)\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A x̄ and B x̄. Since A and B are subsets of U and V, respectively, we have:\n\nA x̄ = U - A = ∅\nB x̄ = V - B = ∅\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A x̄ and B x̄:\n\nA x̄ x B x̄ = ∅ x ∅ = ∅\n\nFinally, let's find the union of (A x B) x̄ and A x̄ x B x̄:\n\n(A x B) x̄ U (A x̄ x B x̄) = ∅ U ∅ = ∅\n\nNow, let's compare the results:\n\n(A U B) x̄ = ∅\nA x̄ U B x̄ = ∅\n\nIn this specific case, the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over complement, as both (A U B) x̄ and A x̄ U B x̄ are equal to the empty set. However, this result is not generally true for all sets A and B. The distributive property does not hold for the Cartesian product of two sets over complement in general."
