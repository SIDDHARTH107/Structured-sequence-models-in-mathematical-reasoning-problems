    "message_2": "The hint to use Bell numbers is incorrect for this problem. Instead, we will use the concept of permutations to solve this problem.\n\nThere are 10 students who can potentially rank in the first position. Once the first position is filled, there are 9 students left who can potentially rank in the second position. Finally, once the first and second positions are filled, there are 8 students left who can potentially rank in the third position.\n\nTo find the total number of different ways the students can rank in the top three positions, we simply multiply the number of possibilities for each position:\n\n10 (first position) * 9 (second position) * 8 (third position) = 720 different ways."
