The goal is to find the maximum flow that can be sent from node A to node H.\n\nUsing the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, find the maximum flow in the network and show the flow path with its corresponding flow values.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in the network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we will iteratively find augmenting paths from the source (node A) to the sink (node H) and update the residual capacities of the edges. We will continue this process until there are no more augmenting paths left.\n\nStep 1: Initialize flow in all edges to 0.\n\nStep 2: Find an augmenting path from A to H using DFS or BFS. We will use DFS in this example.\n\n1st Augmenting Path: A -> B -> E -> H\nFlow in this path: min(10, 8, 10) = 8\nUpdate the residual capacities of the edges in the path.\n\n2nd Augmenting Path: A -> B -> D -> F -> H\nFlow in this path: min(2, 10, 9, 10) = 2\nUpdate the residual capacities of the edges in the path.\n\n3rd Augmenting Path: A -> C -> D -> F -> H\nFlow in this path: min(10, 6, 7, 8) = 6\nUpdate the residual capacities of the edges in the path.\n\n4th Augmenting Path: A -> C -> G -> H\nFlow in this path: min(4, 4, 4) = 4\nUpdate the residual capacities of the edges in the path.\n\nNow, there are no more augmenting paths left from A to H.\n\nThe maximum flow in the network is the sum of the flows in the augmenting paths: 8 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 20.\n\nThe flow path with its corresponding flow values is as follows:\n\nA -> B -> E -> H: 8\nA -> B -> D -> F -> H: 2\nA -> C -> D -> F -> H: 6\nA -> C -> G -> H: 4"
