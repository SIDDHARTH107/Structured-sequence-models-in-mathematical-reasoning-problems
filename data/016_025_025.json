    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that can be generated through an iterative process. In each iteration (or order), the number of black squares increases. The first order has only one black square. For each subsequent order, the number of black squares triples.\n\nTo find the total number of black squares in the Sierpinski sieve of order 5, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal black squares = (3^(n-1) - 1) / 2\n\nwhere n is the order of the Sierpinski sieve.\n\nFor order 5:\n\nTotal black squares = (3^(5-1) - 1) / 2\nTotal black squares = (3^4 - 1) / 2\nTotal black squares = (81 - 1) / 2\nTotal black squares = 80 / 2\nTotal black squares = 40\n\nSo, the total number of black squares in the Sierpinski sieve of order 5 is 40."
