    "message_2": "The function f(x) = 3x - 2 is computable. A function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can compute the function for any given input. In this case, the function is a simple linear equation, and we can easily create an algorithm to compute the value of f(x) for any input value of x.\n\nAlgorithm for computing f(x) = 3x - 2:\n\n1. Take the input value x.\n2. Multiply x by 3.\n3. Subtract 2 from the result obtained in step 2.\n4. The result obtained in step 3 is the value of f(x).\n\nFor example, if the input value x is 4, the algorithm would compute f(4) as follows:\n\n1. Take the input value x = 4.\n2. Multiply x by 3: 4 * 3 = 12.\n3. Subtract 2 from the result obtained in step 2: 12 - 2 = 10.\n4. The result obtained in step 3 is the value of f(x): f(4) = 10."
