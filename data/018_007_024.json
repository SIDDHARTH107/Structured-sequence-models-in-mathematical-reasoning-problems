    "message_2": "Let X be a set containing exactly 4 elements, i.e., X = {a, b, c, d}. The power set of X, denoted as P(X), is the set of all possible subsets of X, including the empty set and X itself.\n\nTo calculate the number of elements in the power set of X, we can use the formula:\n\n|P(X)| = 2^|X|\n\nwhere |P(X)| represents the number of elements in the power set of X, and |X| represents the number of elements in X.\n\nIn this case, |X| = 4, so:\n\n|P(X)| = 2^4 = 16\n\nThus, the power set of X contains 16 elements.\n\nNow, let's show that the power set of X is always strictly larger than X. We know that |X| = 4 and |P(X)| = 16. Since 16 > 4, it is clear that the power set of X is strictly larger than X. In general, for any set Y with |Y| = n, the power set of Y will have 2^n elements, which will always be strictly larger than n."
