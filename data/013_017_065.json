    "message_1": "In a job market, there are two types of employees: high-quality workers and low-quality workers. The employer can't distinguish between them before hiring. High-quality workers produce a value of $50,000 for the company, while low-quality workers produce only $30,000. The employer offers a salary of $40,000. High-quality workers would be willing to accept the salary, but low-quality workers would not. If the employer offers $50,000, both types of workers will accept. However, the employer would prefer to pay less if possible. What can the employer do to hire more high-quality workers while paying less than $50,000?",
    "message_2": "The employer can implement a screening process to differentiate between high-quality and low-quality workers. This can be done through various methods such as:\n\n1. Skill-based tests: The employer can design tests that assess the skills and knowledge required for the job. High-quality workers are more likely to perform better on these tests, allowing the employer to identify and hire them.\n\n2. Education and experience requirements: The employer can set specific education and experience requirements for the job. High-quality workers may have more relevant education and experience, making them more likely to meet these requirements.\n\n3. Training programs: The employer can offer a training program that only high-quality workers would be willing to complete. For example, the employer could offer a lower starting salary with the promise of a higher salary after successful completion of the training program. High-quality workers, confident in their abilities, would be more likely to accept this offer, while low-quality workers may not be willing to invest the time and effort.\n\n4. Performance-based incentives: The employer can offer performance-based bonuses or salary increases. High-quality workers, who are more likely to achieve higher performance levels, would be more attracted to these incentives.\n\n5. Probationary period: The employer can implement a probationary period during which the worker's performance is closely monitored. If the worker does not meet the performance expectations, the employer can terminate their contract. High-quality workers are more likely to pass the probationary period successfully.\n\nBy using these methods, the employer can increase the likelihood of hiring high-quality workers while offering a salary below $50,000."
