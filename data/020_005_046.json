    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. The production process for each product requires machines that operate at a rate of 120 minutes per day. Each unit of product A requires 30 minutes on machine 1 and 40 minutes on machine 2. Each unit of product B requires 60 minutes on machine 1 and 50 minutes on machine 2. The company has 240 hours of machine time available each month for each machine. If the profit per unit of product A is $50 and the profit per unit of product B is $70, how many units of each product should be produced to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe time constraints for the machines can be represented as linear inequalities:\n\nMachine 1: 30x + 60y ≤ 240 * 60 (since there are 240 hours available per month and 60 minutes in an hour)\nMachine 2: 40x + 50y ≤ 240 * 60\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 50x + 70y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n30x + 60y ≤ 14400\n40x + 50y ≤ 14400\n\nTo find the feasible region, we can find the intercepts and graph the inequalities:\n\nFor Machine 1:\nx-intercept: Set y = 0, then 30x = 14400, x = 480\ny-intercept: Set x = 0, then 60y = 14400, y = 240\n\nFor Machine 2:\nx-intercept: Set y = 0, then 40x = 14400, x = 360\ny-intercept: Set x = 0, then 50y = 14400, y = 288\n\nNow we can find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines:\n\nIntersection of Machine 1 and Machine 2 lines:\n30x + 60y = 14400\n40x + 50y = 14400\n\nWe can use substitution or elimination method to solve this system. Let's use the elimination method:\n\nMultiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\n120x + 240y = 57600\n120x + 150y = 43200\n\nNow subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n90y = 14400\ny = 160\n\nNow substitute y back into one of the original equations to find x:\n\n30x + 60(160) = 14400\n30x + 9600 = 14400\n30x = 4800\nx = 160\n\nSo the intersection point is (160, 160).\n\nNow we need to evaluate the profit function at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 0): Profit = 50(0) + 70(0) = $0\n2. (480, 0): Profit = 50(480) + 70(0) = $24,000\n3. (0, 240): Profit = 50(0) + 70(240) = $16,800\n4. (160, 160): Profit = 50(160) + 70(160) = $19,200\n\nThe maximum profit is $24,000, which occurs when 480 units of product A and 0 units of product B are produced."
