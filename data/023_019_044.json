    "message_2": "To find the frequency response H(jw) of the system, we need to replace s with jw in the given transfer function H(s):\n\nH(jw) = 5/((jw)^2 + 6(jw) + 10)\n\nNow, we need to simplify the expression:\n\nH(jw) = 5/(-w^2 + 6jw + 10)\n\nThe frequency response H(jw) is now in the form of a complex function. To analyze the stability of the system, we need to look at the poles of the transfer function H(s). The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero:\n\ns^2 + 6s + 10 = 0\n\nTo find the roots of this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 10:\n\ns = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4*1*10)) / 2*1\ns = (-6 ± √(36 - 40)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the roots of the equation are complex conjugates:\n\ns = -3 ± j√4\n\nThe poles of the transfer function are s1 = -3 + j2 and s2 = -3 - j2. Since the real parts of both poles are negative, the system is stable."
