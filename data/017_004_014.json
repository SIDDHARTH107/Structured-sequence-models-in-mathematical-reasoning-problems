    "message_2": "To prove that there exists a unique group of order 7², we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of prime order p is always cyclic and isomorphic to the group of integers modulo p (Z_p).\n2. A group of order p^n, where p is prime and n is a positive integer, is a p-group.\n3. The number of groups of order p^n is determined by the number of partitions of n.\n\nSince 7 is a prime number, a group of order 7² is a 7-group. The number of groups of order 7² is determined by the number of partitions of 2. There are two partitions of 2: 2 itself and 1+1. Therefore, there are two possible groups of order 7² up to isomorphism:\n\n1. A group of order 7² that is a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7 (Z_7 × Z_7).\n2. A cyclic group of order 7² (Z_49).\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the group of order 7² is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7.\n\nA group G of order 7² is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 7². If G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7 (Z_7 × Z_7), then the order of any element (a, b) in G is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b. Since the orders of a and b are at most 7, the order of (a, b) is at most 7. Therefore, G cannot be cyclic if it is isomorphic to Z_7 × Z_7.\n\nOn the other hand, if G is cyclic, then it must be isomorphic to Z_49. In this case, G has an element of order 49, and it is not isomorphic to Z_7 × Z_7.\n\nIn conclusion, there exists a unique group of order 7² up to isomorphism. This group can either be cyclic and isomorphic to Z_49 or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7 (Z_7 × Z_7). The group is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 49, and it is isomorphic to Z_7 × Z_7 otherwise."
