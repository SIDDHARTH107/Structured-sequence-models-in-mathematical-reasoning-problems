    "message_1": "A curve is defined by the equation y = 2x^2 - 4x + 5. Find the arc length of the curve from x = 0 to x = 4.",
    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we need to use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx):\n\ny = 2x^2 - 4x + 5\ndy/dx = 4x - 4\n\nNow, we need to square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(4x - 4)^2 + 1 = 16x^2 - 32x + 17\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of this expression:\n\n√(16x^2 - 32x + 17)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the arc length:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(16x^2 - 32x + 17) dx\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. We can use numerical methods, such as Simpson's rule or a computer software like Wolfram Alpha, to approximate the value of the integral.\n\nUsing Wolfram Alpha, we find that the approximate arc length of the curve from x = 0 to x = 4 is:\n\nL ≈ 13.4765"
