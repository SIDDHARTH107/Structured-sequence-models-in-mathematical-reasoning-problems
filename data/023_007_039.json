    "message_2": "To find the value of the signal at t=2 seconds, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω) and then evaluate it at t=2. The inverse Fourier transform of F(ω) is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫ F(ω) e^(jωt) dω\n\nSince F(ω) consists of three terms, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of each term separately and then sum them up.\n\n1. For the first term, 3δ(ω-4):\n\nf₁(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫ 3δ(ω-4) e^(jωt) dω\n\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\n\nf₁(t) = (1/(2π)) * 3 * e^(j(4)t)\n\n2. For the second term, -2jδ(ω+2):\n\nf₂(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫ -2jδ(ω+2) e^(jωt) dω\n\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\n\nf₂(t) = (1/(2π)) * (-2j) * e^(-j(2)t)\n\n3. For the third term, 5e^(-j5ω):\n\nf₃(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫ 5e^(-j5ω) e^(jωt) dω\n\nCombining the exponentials, we get:\n\nf₃(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫ 5e^(j(ωt - 5ω)) dω\n\nThis is a Fourier transform of a complex sinusoid, which can be represented as a Dirac delta function in the frequency domain:\n\nf₃(t) = 5δ(t - 5)\n\nNow, we sum up the three terms:\n\nf(t) = f₁(t) + f₂(t) + f₃(t)\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) * 3 * e^(j(4)t) + (1/(2π)) * (-2j) * e^(-j(2)t) + 5δ(t - 5)\n\nSince f(t) is a real-valued signal, we need to consider only the real parts of the complex exponentials:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) * 3 * cos(4t) - (1/(2π)) * 2 * sin(2t) + 5δ(t - 5)\n\nNow, we evaluate f(t) at t=2 seconds:\n\nf(2) = (1/(2π)) * 3 * cos(8) - (1/(2π)) * 2 * sin(4) + 5δ(2 - 5)\n\nSince the Dirac delta function δ(2 - 5) is zero at t=2, we can ignore that term:\n\nf(2) = (1/(2π)) * 3 * cos(8) - (1/(2π)) * 2 * sin(4)\n\nf(2) ≈ (1/(2π)) * 3 * (-0.1455) - (1/(2π)) * 2 * (-0.7568)\n\nf(2) ≈ -0.6955 + 0.2411\n\nf(2) ≈ -0.4544\n\nSo, the value of the signal at t=2 seconds is approximately -0.4544."
