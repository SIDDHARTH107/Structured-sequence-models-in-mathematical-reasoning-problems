    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems. Since the order of G is 27, which is a prime power (3^3), G is a p-group. Let's find the Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27, so n_3 divides 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. The only divisor that satisfies both conditions is n_3 = 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which is of order 27. By the Sylow theorems, this subgroup is normal in G. Since there is only one such subgroup, it must be G itself.\n\nNow, we know that G is a group of order 27 with a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 27. This means that G is either a cyclic group of order 27, or a non-abelian group of order 27. To determine which one it is, we can look at the center of G, denoted Z(G).\n\nIf G is abelian, then Z(G) = G, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27. If G is non-abelian, then Z(G) is a proper nontrivial subgroup of G. Since G is a p-group, Z(G) is also a p-group, and its order must be a power of 3. The only possibilities are |Z(G)| = 3 or |Z(G)| = 9.\n\nIf |Z(G)| = 3, then G/Z(G) is a group of order 9, which is abelian, and G is a non-abelian group of order 27. If |Z(G)| = 9, then G/Z(G) is a group of order 3, which is cyclic, and G is also abelian, so G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of proper subgroups that G has. If G is isomorphic to C27, then it has subgroups of order 1, 3, and 9. There is 1 subgroup of order 1 (the trivial subgroup), 1 subgroup of order 27 (G itself), and by the formula for the number of subgroups of a cyclic group, there are (27-1)/3 = 8 subgroups of order 3, and (9-1)/3 = 2 subgroups of order 9. So, in this case, G has 8 + 2 = 10 proper subgroups.\n\nIf G is the non-abelian group of order 27, then it has a normal subgroup of order 9, say H. By the correspondence theorem, the subgroups of G containing H correspond to the subgroups of G/H, which is a group of order 3. Since a group of order 3 has only two subgroups (the trivial subgroup and itself), there are two subgroups of G containing H. One of them is H itself, and the other is G. So, in this case, G has 1 (trivial subgroup) + 8 (subgroups of order 3) + 1 (subgroup of order 9) = 10 proper subgroups.\n\nIn either case, G has 10 proper subgroups."
