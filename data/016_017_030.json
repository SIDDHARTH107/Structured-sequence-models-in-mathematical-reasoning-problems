    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the curve doubles, and the length of each segment is halved.\n\nAfter 10 iterations, the number of segments in the curve will be 2^10 = 1024. Since the initial line segment has a length of 1, the length of each segment after 10 iterations will be 1/(2^10) = 1/1024.\n\nThe perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is the total length of all the segments, which can be calculated as follows:\n\nPerimeter = (Number of segments) * (Length of each segment)\nPerimeter = 1024 * (1/1024)\nPerimeter = 1\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1."
