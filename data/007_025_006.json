    "message_1": "Alice and Bob are trying to share a secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. They both agree to use a prime number p = 23 and a base number g = 5. Alice chooses a secret number a = 6 and Bob chooses a secret number b = 9. What is the secret key that they will share?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the base number, a is Alice's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n5. If the protocol is successful, K_A and K_B should be equal, and this value is the shared secret key.\n\nLet's compute the shared secret key:\n\n1. A = 5^6 mod 23\n   A = 15625 mod 23\n   A = 8\n\n2. B = 5^9 mod 23\n   B = 1953125 mod 23\n   B = 2\n\n3. K_A = B^a mod p\n   K_A = 2^6 mod 23\n   K_A = 64 mod 23\n   K_A = 18\n\n4. K_B = A^b mod p\n   K_B = 8^9 mod 23\n   K_B = 134217728 mod 23\n   K_B = 18\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, the shared secret key is 18."
