    "message_2": "The statement \"If I study math every day, then I complete all my assignments on time\" is a conditional statement represented as P → Q. In this case, P is true and Q is false. \n\nA conditional statement is false only when the antecedent (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is false. Since P is true and Q is false in this situation, the statement P → Q is false. So, the truth value of the statement \"If I study math every day, then I complete all my assignments on time\" is false."
