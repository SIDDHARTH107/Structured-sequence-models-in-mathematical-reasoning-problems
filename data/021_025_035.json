    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. However, using WOA for a simple quadratic function like f(x) = 4x^2 + 5x - 2 is not necessary. Instead, we can find the minimum value of f(x) using calculus.\n\nTo find the minimum value of f(x) = 4x^2 + 5x - 2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x.\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n3. Determine if the critical point is a minimum or maximum by analyzing the second derivative.\n\nStep 1: Find the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x.\n\nf'(x) = d(4x^2 + 5x - 2)/dx = 8x + 5\n\nStep 2: Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n\n8x + 5 = 0\n8x = -5\nx = -5/8\n\nStep 3: Determine if the critical point is a minimum or maximum by analyzing the second derivative.\n\nf''(x) = d(8x + 5)/dx = 8\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, the critical point at x = -5/8 is a minimum.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [-5, 5] to ensure that the minimum value occurs within this interval.\n\nf(-5) = 4(-5)^2 + 5(-5) - 2 = 100\nf(5) = 4(5)^2 + 5(5) - 2 = 120\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) over the interval [-5, 5] occurs at x = -5/8:\n\nf(-5/8) = 4(-5/8)^2 + 5(-5/8) - 2 â‰ˆ -6.5625\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) = 4x^2 + 5x - 2 over the interval [-5, 5] is approximately -6.5625."
