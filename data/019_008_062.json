    "message_1": "What is the degree of truth of the following statement: \"The temperature in the room is hot\"? Assume the degrees of truth are as follows: Cold (0), Cool (0.4), Warm (0.7), and Hot (1). The thermometer in the room indicates a temperature reading of 26.5°C, but it is up to the student to decide if this constitutes \"hot\" or not. Using fuzzy logic, the student should assign a numerical degree of truth to the statement.",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of truth for the statement \"The temperature in the room is hot\" using fuzzy logic, we need to establish some reference points for the temperature categories. Let's assume the following temperature ranges:\n\n- Cold: below 15°C\n- Cool: 15°C to 20°C\n- Warm: 20°C to 25°C\n- Hot: above 25°C\n\nSince the temperature in the room is 26.5°C, it falls into the \"Hot\" category. However, it's just above the boundary between \"Warm\" and \"Hot.\" Using fuzzy logic, we can assign a degree of truth that takes into account the proximity to the boundary.\n\nLet's assume a linear transition between the categories. In this case, the degree of truth for \"Hot\" would be:\n\nDegree of truth (Hot) = (26.5 - 25) / (30 - 25) = 1.5 / 5 = 0.3\n\nSince the maximum degree of truth for \"Hot\" is 1, we can add this 0.3 to the degree of truth for \"Warm\" (0.7):\n\nDegree of truth (Hot) = 0.7 + 0.3 = 1\n\nTherefore, using fuzzy logic, the degree of truth for the statement \"The temperature in the room is hot\" is 1."
