The plant needs to produce at least 500 units of a product using a maximum of 60 workers and 40 machines per hour. Use the cuckoo search algorithm to optimize the number of workers and machines required to produce the 500 units with the minimum cost per hour.",
    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. In this problem, we will use the algorithm to optimize the number of workers and machines required to produce at least 500 units with the minimum cost per hour.\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function\nThe objective function is the total cost per hour, which is given by:\nf(x, y) = 25x + 30y\nwhere x is the number of workers and y is the number of machines.\n\nStep 2: Define the constraints\n1. x + y <= 100 (maximum of 60 workers and 40 machines)\n2. x >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negative number of workers and machines)\n3. Production constraint: The plant needs to produce at least 500 units per hour. We need to know the production rate of workers and machines to include this constraint. Let's assume that each worker can produce 10 units per hour and each machine can produce 15 units per hour. Then, the constraint is:\n10x + 15y >= 500\n\nStep 3: Initialize the cuckoo search algorithm\n1. Set the initial population size (n) and the number of iterations (T).\n2. Generate n random solutions (x_i, y_i) that satisfy the constraints.\n3. Evaluate the objective function for each solution.\n\nStep 4: Perform the cuckoo search algorithm\n1. For each iteration t = 1, 2, ..., T:\n   a. Select a random cuckoo (x_i, y_i) and generate a new solution (x', y') by performing a random walk.\n   b. If the new solution satisfies the constraints and has a better objective function value, replace the old solution with the new one.\n   c. Choose a random solution (x_j, y_j) from the population. If the cuckoo's solution (x_i, y_i) is better, replace (x_j, y_j) with (x_i, y_i).\n   d. Update the best solution found so far.\n2. Return the best solution found after T iterations.\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm, we will obtain the optimal number of workers and machines that minimize the cost per hour while satisfying the production and constraint requirements."
