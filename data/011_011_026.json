    "message_1": "A group of 12 students is preparing for a school talent show. They want to perform a dance routine, but they want to split into smaller groups for the routine. Each group must have at least 2 members, and all of the students must belong to a group. In how many different ways can the students be split into groups for the routine?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of partitioning. A partition of a number is a way of writing it as a sum of positive integers. In this case, we want to partition the number 12 into groups of at least 2 members.\n\nLet's represent the students as 12 dots:\n\n• • • • • • • • • • • •\n\nWe can partition the 12 students into groups by placing dividers between the dots. Since each group must have at least 2 members, we can place the dividers in the following ways:\n\n1. 5 dividers: This will create 6 groups of 2 members each.\n•|• •|• •|• •|• •|•\n2. 4 dividers: This will create 5 groups, with at least one group having 3 members.\n•|• •|• •|• •|• • •\n3. 3 dividers: This will create 4 groups, with various possible group sizes.\n   a) One group of 4 members and three groups of 2 members.\n   •|• •|• •|• • • •\n   b) Two groups of 3 members and two groups of 2 members.\n   •|• •|• • •|• • •\n4. 2 dividers: This will create 3 groups, with various possible group sizes.\n   a) One group of 6 members and two groups of 2 members.\n   •|• • • • • •|• •\n   b) One group of 5 members, one group of 3 members, and one group of 2 members.\n   •|• • • • • • •|•\n   c) One group of 4 members and two groups of 3 members.\n   •|• • • •|• • • •\n5. 1 divider: This will create 2 groups, with one group having 10 members and the other group having 2 members.\n•|• • • • • • • • • •\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways we can arrange the dividers for each case:\n\n1. 5 dividers: There is only 1 way to arrange the dividers to create 6 groups of 2 members each.\n2. 4 dividers: There are 5 spaces between the dots, so there are 5 ways to place the dividers.\n3. 3 dividers: \n   a) There are 6 spaces between the dots, so there are 6 ways to place the dividers.\n   b) There are 5 spaces between the dots, so there are 5 ways to place the dividers.\n4. 2 dividers: \n   a) There are 7 spaces between the dots, so there are 7 ways to place the dividers.\n   b) There are 6 spaces between the dots, so there are 6 ways to place the dividers.\n   c) There are 5 spaces between the dots, so there are 5 ways to place the dividers.\n5. 1 divider: There are 8 spaces between the dots, so there are 8 ways to place the divider.\n\nAdding up all the possible ways to arrange the dividers, we get:\n\n1 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 8 = 43\n\nSo there are 43 different ways the students can be split into groups for the routine."
