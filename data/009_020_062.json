    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the differential equation for exponential growth:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, and k is the growth constant.\n\nFirst, we need to separate the variables:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nNow, we'll integrate both sides:\n\n∫(dP/P) = ∫(k dt)\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we'll use the initial condition P(0) = 1000:\n\nln(1000) = k(0) + C\n\nC = ln(1000)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = kt + ln(1000)\n\nTo solve for P, we'll use the exponential function:\n\nP(t) = e^(kt + ln(1000))\n\nP(t) = e^(kt) * e^(ln(1000))\n\nP(t) = 1000 * e^(kt)\n\nNow we can find the population at t=5 hours with k=0.02 hr^-1:\n\nP(5) = 1000 * e^(0.02 * 5)\n\nP(5) = 1000 * e^0.1\n\nP(5) ≈ 1000 * 1.10517\n\nP(5) ≈ 1105.17\n\nSo, the population at t=5 hours is approximately 1105 bacteria."
