    "message_1": "Consider the English alphabet has 26 letters. A substitution cipher replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter from the alphabet. If a monoalphabetic substitution cipher is used where only one letter from the alphabet is used to replace all the other letters, how many possible different ciphers can be created?",
    "message_2": "In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher where only one letter from the alphabet is used to replace all the other letters, we have 25 possible choices for each letter in the plaintext (since we cannot replace a letter with itself). Therefore, there are 25 different ciphers that can be created."
