    "message_1": "Consider the moduli space M_{2,1} of all elliptic curves with a marked point. Suppose that we want to count the number of isomorphism classes of curves in M_{2,1} defined over the field of rational numbers Q. How many non-isomorphic elliptic curves with a marked point over Q are there in M_{2,1}?",
    "message_2": "The moduli space M_{2,1} of elliptic curves with a marked point is isomorphic to the moduli space M_1 of elliptic curves without a marked point, since the marked point does not affect the isomorphism class of the curve. Therefore, we can count the number of non-isomorphic elliptic curves over Q in M_1.\n\nAn elliptic curve E over Q can be given by a Weierstrass equation of the form:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B\n\nwhere A and B are rational numbers, and the discriminant Δ = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2) is nonzero. Two elliptic curves given by Weierstrass equations are isomorphic over Q if and only if they can be obtained from each other by a change of variables of the form:\n\nx = u^2 x' + r, y = u^3 y' + su^2 x' + t\n\nwhere r, s, t, and u are rational numbers, and u is nonzero.\n\nTo count the number of non-isomorphic elliptic curves over Q, we can use the j-invariant, which is an invariant of the isomorphism class of an elliptic curve. The j-invariant of an elliptic curve given by a Weierstrass equation is defined as:\n\nj(E) = 1728 * (4A^3) / Δ\n\nSince Δ is nonzero, j(E) is well-defined and is a rational number. Moreover, two elliptic curves are isomorphic over Q if and only if they have the same j-invariant.\n\nTherefore, the problem of counting the number of non-isomorphic elliptic curves over Q reduces to counting the number of distinct rational j-invariants. However, there is no known formula or method for counting the number of distinct rational j-invariants, and the number of non-isomorphic elliptic curves over Q is infinite. Thus, there are infinitely many non-isomorphic elliptic curves with a marked point over Q in M_{2,1}."
