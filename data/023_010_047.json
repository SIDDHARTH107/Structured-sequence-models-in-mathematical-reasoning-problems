    "message_1": "Here's a specific numerical problem for a math student to solve regarding applying the Fourier transform to image processing:\n\nA grayscale image has dimensions of 512 x 512. After applying the 2D Fourier Transform, only the frequencies in the range [20, 60] in both the x and y directions are kept. The inverse 2D Fourier Transform is then applied to the filtered image. Determine the dimensions of the resulting image, and the size (in bytes) of the resulting image file assuming each pixel is represented using a single byte.",
    "message_2": "After applying the 2D Fourier Transform and keeping only the frequencies in the range [20, 60] in both the x and y directions, we have a filtered image of dimensions 41 x 41 (since there are 60 - 20 + 1 = 41 frequencies in the specified range for both x and y directions).\n\nWhen the inverse 2D Fourier Transform is applied to the filtered image, the dimensions of the resulting image will still be the same as the filtered image, which is 41 x 41.\n\nTo calculate the size of the resulting image file, we need to multiply the dimensions by the number of bytes per pixel. Since each pixel is represented using a single byte, the size of the resulting image file will be:\n\nSize = Width x Height x Bytes per pixel\nSize = 41 x 41 x 1\nSize = 1681 bytes"
