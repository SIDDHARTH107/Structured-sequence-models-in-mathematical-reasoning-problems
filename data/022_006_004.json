Use the maximum modulus principle to find the maximum value of |f(z)| over the boundary of the disk.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of |f(z)| over the boundary of the disk, we need to evaluate f(z) on the unit circle, where |z| = 1. We can parametrize the unit circle using z = e^(iθ), where θ ranges from 0 to 2π.\n\nNow, let's substitute z = e^(iθ) into the function f(z):\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = (e^(iθ))^3 - 4(e^(iθ))^2 + 6(e^(iθ)) - 2\n= e^(3iθ) - 4e^(2iθ) + 6e^(iθ) - 2\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of |f(e^(iθ))|. To do this, we can rewrite the function in terms of its real and imaginary parts:\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = (e^(3iθ) - 4e^(2iθ) + 6e^(iθ) - 2)\n= (cos(3θ) - 4cos(2θ) + 6cos(θ) - 2) + i(sin(3θ) - 4sin(2θ) + 6sin(θ))\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of f(e^(iθ)):\n\n|f(e^(iθ))|^2 = (cos(3θ) - 4cos(2θ) + 6cos(θ) - 2)^2 + (sin(3θ) - 4sin(2θ) + 6sin(θ))^2\n\nTo find the maximum value of |f(e^(iθ))|^2, we can use calculus to find the critical points of the function with respect to θ. However, this approach can be quite complicated. Instead, we can use the maximum modulus principle, which states that the maximum value of |f(z)| on a closed, bounded domain occurs on the boundary of the domain.\n\nSince we are considering the boundary of the unit disk, we can find the maximum value of |f(e^(iθ))|^2 by evaluating the function at various points on the unit circle and comparing the magnitudes.\n\nLet's consider the following points on the unit circle: z = 1, z = -1, z = i, and z = -i.\n\n1. f(1) = 1^3 - 4(1)^2 + 6(1) - 2 = 1 - 4 + 6 - 2 = 1\n   |f(1)| = 1\n\n2. f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 4(-1)^2 + 6(-1) - 2 = -1 - 4 - 6 - 2 = -13\n   |f(-1)| = 13\n\n3. f(i) = (i)^3 - 4(i)^2 + 6(i) - 2 = -i - 4(-1) + 6i - 2 = 4i + 2\n   |f(i)| = √(4^2 + 2^2) = √20\n\n4. f(-i) = (-i)^3 - 4(-i)^2 + 6(-i) - 2 = i - 4(-1) - 6i - 2 = -5i + 2\n   |f(-i)| = √((-5)^2 + 2^2) = √29\n\nComparing the magnitudes, we find that the maximum value of |f(z)| on the boundary of the unit disk is |f(-i)| = √29."
