    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find all pairs of natural numbers (n, m) such that their sum is a perfect square and m ≠ n. We can start by analyzing the properties of perfect squares.\n\nLet's denote the perfect square as k^2, where k is a natural number. Then, we have:\n\nn + m = k^2\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\nm = k^2 - n\n\nNow, let's analyze the difference between consecutive perfect squares:\n\n(k + 1)^2 - k^2 = (k^2 + 2k + 1) - k^2 = 2k + 1\n\nThis means that the difference between consecutive perfect squares is an odd number. We can use this property to find pairs (n, m) that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's consider the case when n is even. Then, n = 2a for some natural number a. We can rewrite the equation for m as:\n\nm = k^2 - 2a\n\nSince the difference between consecutive perfect squares is odd, we can find a pair (n, m) such that their sum is a perfect square if and only if a is odd. In this case, m will also be even, and m ≠ n.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n is odd. Then, n = 2a + 1 for some natural number a. We can rewrite the equation for m as:\n\nm = k^2 - (2a + 1)\n\nIn this case, we can find a pair (n, m) such that their sum is a perfect square if and only if a is even. Then, m will also be odd, and m ≠ n.\n\nTo find the sum of all pairs (n, m) that satisfy the given conditions, we can iterate through all natural numbers and check if the corresponding value of m is also a natural number. If it is, we add n to the sum. We can do this for both even and odd values of n.\n\nLet's denote the sum as S. Then, we have:\n\nS = ∑(even n) + ∑(odd n)\n\nWe can calculate the sum for even and odd values of n separately:\n\nS_even = ∑(2a) for odd a\nS_odd = ∑(2a + 1) for even a\n\nTo find the total sum, we can combine these two sums:\n\nS = S_even + S_odd\n\nHowever, there is no upper bound for the natural numbers, so the sum will be infinite. Therefore, the value of the sum ∑n∈Sn, ∑m∈Sn, (P(n,m) ∧ m≠n) is infinite."
