    "message_2": "To find the probability of neither a flood nor an earthquake occurring during any given year, we first need to find the probability of each event not occurring.\n\nThe probability of a flood not occurring is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\nThe probability of an earthquake not occurring is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nAssuming that the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each event not occurring to find the probability of neither event occurring:\n\n0.95 * 0.98 = 0.931\n\nSo, the probability of neither a flood nor an earthquake occurring during any given year in the region is approximately 0.931 or 93.1%."
