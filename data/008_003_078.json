    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the given matrix, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nGiven matrix:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n2 & 4 & 6 \\\\ \n3 & 6 & 9 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that there is only one non-zero row, which means there is only one linearly independent row (or column).\n\nTherefore, the rank of the given matrix is 1."
