The project has three possible outcomes: a profit of $50,000 with a probability of 0.4, a profit of $20,000 with a probability of 0.3, and a loss of $10,000 with a probability of 0.3. Using decision theory, what is the expected value of this investment?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of this investment, we need to multiply each outcome by its respective probability and then sum the results. \n\nExpected Value (EV) = (Profit1 * Probability1) + (Profit2 * Probability2) + (Loss * Probability3)\n\nEV = ($50,000 * 0.4) + ($20,000 * 0.3) + (-$10,000 * 0.3)\n\nEV = $20,000 + $6,000 - $3,000\n\nEV = $23,000\n\nThe expected value of this investment is $23,000."
