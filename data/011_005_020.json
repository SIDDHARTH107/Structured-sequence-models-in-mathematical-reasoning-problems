    "message_2": "To ensure that no two girls sit next to each other, we can place the girls in the gaps between the boys or at the ends of the row. There are 6 possible positions for the girls (5 gaps between the boys and 2 ends of the row).\n\nFirst, arrange the 5 boys in a row. There are 5! (5 factorial) ways to do this, which is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 ways.\n\nNext, arrange the 3 girls in the 6 available positions. There are 6!/(6-3)! = 6 × 5 × 4 ways to do this, which is 120 ways.\n\nFinally, multiply the number of ways to arrange the boys and the number of ways to arrange the girls to get the total number of ways to seat them: 120 (boys) × 120 (girls) = 14,400 ways."
