    "message_2": "To calculate the De Rham cohomology of the differential form df, we first need to find the exterior derivative of the given function f(x, y, z).\n\nGiven f(x, y, z) = 2x^2 + 3xy - 5yz, let's compute its differential df:\n\ndf = (∂f/∂x) dx + (∂f/∂y) dy + (∂f/∂z) dz\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 4x + 3y\n∂f/∂y = 3x - 5z\n∂f/∂z = -5y\n\nSo, df = (4x + 3y) dx + (3x - 5z) dy - 5y dz\n\nNow, we need to find the exterior derivative of df, which is d(df). Since df is a 1-form, d(df) will be a 2-form:\n\nd(df) = (∂(4x + 3y)/∂y - ∂(3x - 5z)/∂x) dx∧dy + (∂(4x + 3y)/∂z - ∂(-5y)/∂x) dx∧dz + (∂(3x - 5z)/∂z - ∂(-5y)/∂y) dy∧dz\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂(4x + 3y)/∂y = 3\n∂(3x - 5z)/∂x = 3\n∂(4x + 3y)/∂z = 0\n∂(-5y)/∂x = 0\n∂(3x - 5z)/∂z = -5\n∂(-5y)/∂y = -5\n\nSo, d(df) = (3 - 3) dx∧dy + (0 - 0) dx∧dz + (-5 - (-5)) dy∧dz = 0\n\nSince d(df) = 0, the De Rham cohomology of the differential form df is trivial, meaning it belongs to the closed forms but not to the exact forms. In other words, the De Rham cohomology group is H^1(M) = 0, where M is the 3-dimensional space."
