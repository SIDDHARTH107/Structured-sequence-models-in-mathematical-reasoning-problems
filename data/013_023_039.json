    "message_1": "Consider two players, Alice and Bob, playing a trust game. Alice is provided with $10 and has the choice to either keep the money or send some or all of it to Bob. If Alice sends the money to Bob, the amount she sends will be tripled (i.e., if Alice sends $5 to Bob, Bob will receive $15). Bob then has the option to send some of the tripled money back to Alice or keep it for himself. Suppose that Bob is very trustworthy and will always send back half of the amount he receives from Alice. What is the amount Alice should send to Bob to maximize her potential return?",
    "message_2": "To maximize her potential return, Alice should send the entire $10 to Bob. When Bob receives the $10, it will be tripled to $30. Since Bob is very trustworthy and will always send back half of the amount he receives, he will send back $15 to Alice. \n\nIn this scenario, Alice will end up with $15, which is more than the initial $10 she started with. By sending the entire $10 to Bob, Alice maximizes her potential return."
