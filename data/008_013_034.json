    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\nx + y + z = 6\n2x + 3y + 4z = 20\n4x + 5y + 6z = 34\n\nThe coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix B are:\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |\n    | 2  3  4 |\n    | 4  5  6 |\n\nB = | 6  |\n    | 20 |\n    | 34 |\n\nNow, let's find the LU decomposition of matrix A.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the elements of the first column of L and the first row of U.\n\nL11 = 1 (since L has 1's on the diagonal)\nU11 = A11 = 1\nU12 = A12 = 1\nU13 = A13 = 1\n\nStep 2: Calculate the elements of the second column of L and the second row of U.\n\nL21 = A21 / U11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nL22 = sqrt(A22 - L21 * U12) = sqrt(3 - 2 * 1) = sqrt(1) = 1\nU23 = (A23 - L21 * U13) / L22 = (4 - 2 * 1) / 1 = 2\n\nStep 3: Calculate the elements of the third column of L and the third row of U.\n\nL31 = A31 / U11 = 4 / 1 = 4\nL32 = (A32 - L31 * U12) / U22 = (5 - 4 * 1) / 1 = 1\nL33 = sqrt(A33 - L31 * U13 - L32 * U23) = sqrt(6 - 4 * 1 - 1 * 2) = sqrt(0) = 0\n\nSince L33 = 0, we cannot proceed with the LU decomposition as it requires a non-zero value on the diagonal of L. This means that the given matrix A is singular and cannot be decomposed into LU form. Therefore, we cannot use LU decomposition to solve this system of linear equations."
