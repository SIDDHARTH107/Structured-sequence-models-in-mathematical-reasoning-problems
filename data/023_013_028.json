One end of the rod is kept at 500 degrees Celsius while the other end is kept at 0 degrees Celsius. Using the Fourier transform method, find the temperature distribution of the rod after 20 seconds if its thermal diffusivity is 0.5 cm^2/s. Assume that the temperature oscillates sinusoidally with time, with no steady-state temperature distribution.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the rod after 20 seconds, we can use the Fourier series method. The temperature distribution can be represented by the following equation:\n\nT(x, t) = A0 + ∑[An * cos(n * π * x / L) * exp(-α * (n * π / L)^2 * t)]\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, A0 is the average temperature, An are the Fourier coefficients, L is the length of the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity, and n is the index of summation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Fourier coefficients An. Since the temperature at the ends of the rod is fixed, we can use the boundary conditions T(0, t) = 500 and T(L, t) = 0 to find the coefficients:\n\nAn = (2 / L) * ∫[T(x, 0) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is T(x, 0) = 200. Plugging this into the equation, we get:\n\nAn = (2 / L) * ∫[200 * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nIntegrating and simplifying, we get:\n\nAn = (400 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can plug the coefficients An into the equation for T(x, t) and sum the series. Since the thermal diffusivity α is given in cm^2/s, we need to convert the length of the rod to centimeters: L = 200 cm. The thermal diffusivity α is 0.5 cm^2/s, and the time t is 20 seconds.\n\nT(x, t) = A0 + ∑[(400 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * cos(n * π * x / 200) * exp(-0.5 * (n * π / 200)^2 * 20)]\n\nTo find the average temperature A0, we can use the initial temperature distribution:\n\nA0 = (1 / L) * ∫[T(x, 0) dx] from 0 to L = (1 / 200) * ∫[200 dx] from 0 to 200 = 200\n\nSo, the temperature distribution after 20 seconds is:\n\nT(x, t) = 200 + ∑[(400 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * cos(n * π * x / 200) * exp(-0.5 * (n * π / 200)^2 * 20)]\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution of the rod at any position x and time t = 20 seconds. To find the temperature at a specific position, plug in the value of x and sum the series. Note that the series converges quickly, so you can truncate the series after a few terms to get a good approximation of the temperature distribution."
