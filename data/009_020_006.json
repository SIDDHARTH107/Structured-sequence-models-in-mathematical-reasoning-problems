    "message_2": "1. To find the general solution to the differential equation y'' - y' - 6y = 0, we first find the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 - r - 6 = 0\n\nThis factors to (r - 3)(r + 2) = 0, so the roots are r1 = 3 and r2 = -2. Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = C1 * e^(3t) + C2 * e^(-2t)\n\n2. To find the specific solution that satisfies the initial conditions y(0) = 5 and y'(0) = -1, we first plug in the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = C1 * e^(3*0) + C2 * e^(-2*0) = C1 + C2 = 5\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the general solution:\n\ny'(t) = 3 * C1 * e^(3t) - 2 * C2 * e^(-2t)\n\nAnd plug in the initial condition for y'(0):\n\ny'(0) = 3 * C1 * e^(3*0) - 2 * C2 * e^(-2*0) = 3C1 - 2C2 = -1\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n\nC1 + C2 = 5\n3C1 - 2C2 = -1\n\nSolving this system, we find C1 = 1 and C2 = 4. Thus, the specific solution is:\n\ny(t) = e^(3t) + 4 * e^(-2t)\n\n3. The given differential equation is a linear time-invariant system, and the cost functional is quadratic. However, the problem is not stated in the standard form of a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, and there is no control input u(t) in the differential equation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the system is controllable or to find the optimal control function that minimizes the cost functional J(u) as stated."
