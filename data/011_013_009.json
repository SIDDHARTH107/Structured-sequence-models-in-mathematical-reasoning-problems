In how many ways can they be arranged in a line for a group photo if:\n- One of the managers must always be in the center of the photo?\n- The managers must stand together in the photo? \n- The engineers must be arranged in a row first, followed by the managers in a row behind them?",
    "message_2": "1. One of the managers must always be in the center of the photo:\n\nSince there are 10 employees, the center position is the 5th position. We can choose 1 manager out of 3 to be in the center, which can be done in 3 ways (3C1 = 3). Now, we have 9 remaining positions and 9 remaining employees (2 managers and 7 engineers). These 9 employees can be arranged in 9! ways. \n\nSo, the total number of arrangements with one manager in the center is 3 * 9! = 3 * 362,880 = 1,088,640 ways.\n\n2. The managers must stand together in the photo:\n\nWe can consider the 3 managers as a single unit. Now, we have 8 units (1 unit of managers and 7 engineers) to arrange, which can be done in 8! ways. Within the managers' unit, the 3 managers can be arranged in 3! ways. \n\nSo, the total number of arrangements with managers standing together is 8! * 3! = 40,320 * 6 = 241,920 ways.\n\n3. The engineers must be arranged in a row first, followed by the managers in a row behind them:\n\nSince the engineers are in the first row, there are 7! ways to arrange them. In the second row, there are 3 managers, and they can be arranged in 3! ways. \n\nSo, the total number of arrangements with engineers in the first row and managers in the second row is 7! * 3! = 5,040 * 6 = 30,240 ways."
