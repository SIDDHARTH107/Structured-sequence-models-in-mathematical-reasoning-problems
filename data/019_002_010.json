    "message_1": "Consider the following predicates:\n\nP(x) = \"x is an even number\"\nQ(x) = \"x is a multiple of 3\"\n\nUsing predicate logic, determine if the statement \"There exists an even number that is not a multiple of 3\" is true or false. If your answer is true, provide an example of such an even number.",
    "message_2": "The statement \"There exists an even number that is not a multiple of 3\" can be written in predicate logic as:\n\n∃x (P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x))\n\nTo determine if this statement is true or false, we need to find an even number that is not a multiple of 3. Let's consider the even number 4.\n\nP(4) is true because 4 is an even number.\nQ(4) is false because 4 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nSince P(4) is true and Q(4) is false, the statement \"There exists an even number that is not a multiple of 3\" is true. An example of such an even number is 4."
