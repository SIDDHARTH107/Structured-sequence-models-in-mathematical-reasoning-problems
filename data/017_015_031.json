    "message_2": "The five non-abelian groups of order 24 are:\n\n1. S_4 (Symmetric group on 4 elements)\n2. A_4 (Alternating group on 4 elements)\n3. D_12 (Dihedral group of order 12)\n4. Z_2 × S_3 (Direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the symmetric group on 3 elements)\n5. Z_2 × A_4 (Direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the alternating group on 4 elements)\n\nTo determine which of these groups is isomorphic to the group of rotations and reflections of a regular tetrahedron, we can consider the properties of the group of symmetries of a tetrahedron, which is called the tetrahedral group T.\n\nThe tetrahedral group T has 12 elements, consisting of 8 rotations and 4 reflections. The rotations form a subgroup of T, which is isomorphic to A_4. The reflections form a normal subgroup of T, which is isomorphic to Z_2.\n\nSince the rotations form a subgroup isomorphic to A_4 and the reflections form a normal subgroup isomorphic to Z_2, the group of rotations and reflections of a regular tetrahedron is isomorphic to the direct product Z_2 × A_4."
