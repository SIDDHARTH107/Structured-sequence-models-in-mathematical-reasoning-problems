    "message_2": "The Cantor set is formed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment in the previous iteration. The total length of the Cantor set after an infinite number of iterations can be found using the geometric series formula:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere a is the initial length, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of iterations. In this case, the initial length is 27 units, and the common ratio is 2/3 (since we are removing 1/3 of the length and keeping 2/3 of it).\n\nAs the number of iterations approaches infinity, the term r^n approaches 0. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:\n\nSum = a / (1 - r)\n\nPlugging in the values for a and r, we get:\n\nSum = 27 / (1 - 2/3)\n\nSum = 27 / (1/3)\n\nSum = 27 * 3\n\nSum = 81\n\nSo, the total length of the Cantor set after an infinite number of iterations, starting with a line segment of length 27 units, is 81 units."
