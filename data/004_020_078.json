    "message_2": "To find the total work done by the force of friction and the force applied to the crate, we need to consider the work done by each force separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Work done by the applied force:\nThe work done by the applied force (W_applied) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW_applied = F_applied * d * cos(theta)\n\nwhere F_applied is the applied force, d is the distance, and theta is the angle between the force and the displacement.\n\nIn this case, F_applied = 40 N, d = 8 m, and since the force is applied horizontally and the displacement is also horizontal, theta = 0 degrees. Therefore, cos(theta) = cos(0) = 1.\n\nW_applied = 40 N * 8 m * 1 = 320 J\n\n2. Work done by the force of friction:\nTo find the work done by the force of friction (W_friction), we first need to find the frictional force (F_friction). We can use the formula:\n\nF_friction = friction_coefficient * F_normal\n\nwhere friction_coefficient is the coefficient of friction between the crate and the surface, and F_normal is the normal force acting on the crate.\n\nSince the crate is on a flat surface, the normal force is equal to the weight of the crate, which is 200 N. We are not given the coefficient of friction, so we'll denote it as \"μ\".\n\nF_friction = μ * 200 N\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done by the force of friction using the same formula as before:\n\nW_friction = F_friction * d * cos(theta)\n\nIn this case, F_friction = μ * 200 N, d = 8 m, and since the force of friction acts opposite to the direction of the displacement, theta = 180 degrees. Therefore, cos(theta) = cos(180) = -1.\n\nW_friction = (μ * 200 N) * 8 m * (-1) = -1600 μ J\n\n3. Total work done:\nThe total work done (W_total) is the sum of the work done by the applied force and the work done by the force of friction:\n\nW_total = W_applied + W_friction = 320 J - 1600 μ J\n\nSince we don't have the value of the coefficient of friction (μ), we cannot find the exact value of the total work done. However, the expression 320 J - 1600 μ J represents the total work done by the force of friction and the force applied to the crate."
