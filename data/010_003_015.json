    "message_2": "In a $T_1$ space, for any two distinct points x and y, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∉ U, and y ∈ V, x ∉ V. In other words, every pair of distinct points can be separated by open sets.\n\nLet's consider a $T_1$ space with 7 points: {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}. To separate each pair of points, we need to find the smallest number of open sets required.\n\nWe can start by constructing an open set for each point that does not contain the other points. For example:\n\n1. U1 = {a} (separates a from b, c, d, e, f, g)\n2. U2 = {b} (separates b from a, c, d, e, f, g)\n3. U3 = {c} (separates c from a, b, d, e, f, g)\n4. U4 = {d} (separates d from a, b, c, e, f, g)\n5. U5 = {e} (separates e from a, b, c, d, f, g)\n6. U6 = {f} (separates f from a, b, c, d, e, g)\n7. U7 = {g} (separates g from a, b, c, d, e, f)\n\nWith these 7 open sets, each point is separated from the other 6 points. Therefore, the smallest number of open sets required to separate the points of a $T_1$ space with 7 points is 7."
