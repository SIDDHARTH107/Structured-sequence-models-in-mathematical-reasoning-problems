    "message_1": "A company claims that their vacuum cleaner has a mean suction power of 1000 watts with a standard deviation of 50 watts. A customer randomly selects 25 vacuum cleaners and measures their suction power. The sample mean is calculated to be 995 watts. \n\nCan the customer reject the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the customer can reject the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05, we will perform a one-sample z-test. \n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean suction power of the vacuum cleaners is 1000 watts, as claimed by the company. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean suction power is not 1000 watts.\n\nGiven information:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 1000 watts\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 50 watts\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample mean (x̄) = 995 watts\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean:\nSE = σ / √n = 50 / √25 = 50 / 5 = 10 watts\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score for the sample mean:\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (995 - 1000) / 10 = -5 / 10 = -0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05. We can look this up in a standard z-table or use a calculator:\nz_critical = ±1.96\n\nSince the calculated z-score (-0.5) is within the range of the critical z-values (-1.96 to 1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that the customer does not have enough evidence to reject the company's claim that the mean suction power is 1000 watts at a significance level of 0.05."
