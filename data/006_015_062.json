    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, DDoS attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (24 hours) given a constant average rate (0.5 attacks per hour).\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of observing k events in the given time period\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events per time period (in this case, λ = 0.5 attacks per hour * 24 hours = 12 attacks per 24-hour period)\n- k is the number of events we are interested in (in this case, we want to find the probability of at least one DDoS attack occurring, so we will need to calculate the complementary probability of no attacks occurring and subtract it from 1)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of no DDoS attacks occurring (k=0):\n\nP(X=0) = (e^(-12) * 12^0) / 0!\nP(X=0) = (e^(-12) * 1) / 1\nP(X=0) ≈ 0.000006144\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability of at least one DDoS attack occurring:\n\nP(X≥1) = 1 - P(X=0)\nP(X≥1) = 1 - 0.000006144\nP(X≥1) ≈ 0.999993856\n\nSo, the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a network during a 24-hour period, given an average occurrence rate of 0.5 attacks per hour, is approximately 99.9994%."
