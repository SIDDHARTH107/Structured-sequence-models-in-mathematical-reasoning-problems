    "message_1": "Suppose that you want to find the minimum value of a function f(x) = x^2 + 40sin(x) defined on the interval [-10, 10] using simulated annealing method. At each iteration, the algorithm generates x_new based on the current value x_old by adding a random perturbation delta, such that x_new = x_old + delta. The acceptance probability for moving from x_old to x_new is given by: \n\nP(x_old -> x_new) = exp(-[f(x_new) - f(x_old)]/T) \n\nwhere T is the current temperature. Starting from an initial value x_0 randomly chosen in the interval [-10, 10], apply simulated annealing method to find the minimum value of f(x) with a maximum of 1000 iterations, a cooling rate of 0.95, and an initial temperature of 100. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
