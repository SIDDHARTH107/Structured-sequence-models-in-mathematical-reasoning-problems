If the ladder begins to slip down the wall, at what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 4 feet away from the wall?\"",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We know that the ladder is 10 feet long, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nNow, we are given that the ladder is slipping down the wall, and we want to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall (dy/dt) when the bottom of the ladder is 4 feet away from the wall (x = 4). \n\nTo do this, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t):\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are not given the rate at which the base of the ladder is moving away from the wall (dx/dt), but we can find it by using the given information. When x = 4, we can find the corresponding value of y using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n4^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n16 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 84\ny = √84\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x and y into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(4)(dx/dt) + 2(√84)(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe need to find dy/dt, so we'll rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n\ndy/dt = -(4/√84)(dx/dt)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of dx/dt. Since the ladder is slipping down the wall, the base of the ladder is moving away from the wall. We can assume that the ladder is slipping at a constant rate, so the ratio of the rates of change of x and y will be constant:\n\ndx/dt / dy/dt = 6 / 8\n\nNow, we can solve for dx/dt:\n\ndx/dt = (6/8) * dy/dt\n\nPlugging this back into the equation for dy/dt:\n\ndy/dt = -(4/√84) * ((6/8) * dy/dt)\n\nSolving for dy/dt:\n\ndy/dt = -3/√84\n\nSo, when the bottom of the ladder is 4 feet away from the wall, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/√84 feet per second."
