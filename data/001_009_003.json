    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power. In this case, we have two like terms with the variable x (5x and -3x) and two like terms with the variable y (2y and 4y).\n\n5x - 3x = 2x\n2y + 4y = 6y\n\nNow, we can rewrite the simplified expression:\n\n2x + 6y"
