    "message_1": "Here's a possible numerical problem on using the Fourier transform for stability analysis:\n\nConsider a linear time-invariant system described by the differential equation:\n y''(t) + 3y'(t) + 2y(t) = u(t)\n\nwhere y(t) is the response, u(t) is the input, and ' is the derivative with respect to t. \n\nAssume that the input u(t) is a sine wave with frequency 5Hz and amplitude 1. To check if the system is stable, determine the amplitude and phase of the steady-state response y(t) for this input, assuming zero initial conditions, using the Fourier transform method.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the transfer function of the system using the Laplace transform, and then use the Fourier transform to find the steady-state response for the given input.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\ny''(t) + 3y'(t) + 2y(t) = u(t)\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get:\n(s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)) + 3(sY(s) - y(0)) + 2Y(s) = U(s)\n\nAssuming zero initial conditions (y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0), the equation simplifies to:\n(s^2 + 3s + 2)Y(s) = U(s)\n\nNow we can find the transfer function H(s) as the ratio of the output Y(s) to the input U(s):\nH(s) = Y(s) / U(s) = 1 / (s^2 + 3s + 2)\n\nThe input u(t) is a sine wave with frequency 5Hz and amplitude 1:\nu(t) = sin(2π(5)t)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the input, we get:\nU(jω) = π[δ(ω - 2π(5)) - δ(ω + 2π(5))]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of the output Y(jω) by multiplying the transfer function H(jω) with the Fourier transform of the input U(jω):\nY(jω) = H(jω)U(jω)\n\nSubstituting the values of H(jω) and U(jω), we get:\nY(jω) = (1 / ((jω)^2 + 3(jω) + 2)) * π[δ(ω - 2π(5)) - δ(ω + 2π(5))]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate Y(jω) at ω = ±2π(5) to find the amplitude and phase of the steady-state response:\n\nY(j(2π(5))) = (1 / ((j(2π(5)))^2 + 3(j(2π(5))) + 2)) * π\nY(j(2π(5))) = (1 / (-100π^2 + 30πj + 2)) * π\n\nLet Y(j(2π(5))) = AejΦ, where A is the amplitude and Φ is the phase. We can find A and Φ by converting the complex number to polar form:\n\nA = |Y(j(2π(5)))| = π / sqrt((-100π^2 + 2)^2 + (30π)^2)\nΦ = arctan(Im(Y(j(2π(5)))) / Re(Y(j(2π(5))))) = arctan(30π / (-100π^2 + 2))\n\nNow, we have the amplitude A and phase Φ of the steady-state response y(t) for the given input:\ny(t) = A * sin(2π(5)t + Φ)\n\nSo, the amplitude of the steady-state response is A, and the phase is Φ."
