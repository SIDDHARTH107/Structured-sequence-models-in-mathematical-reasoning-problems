    "message_2": "To solve for the value of 'y' in the equation 3x + 2y = 8, we can express y in terms of x. \n\nStep 1: Isolate the term with 'y' on one side of the equation.\n2y = 8 - 3x\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 2.\ny = (8 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we have y in terms of x: y = (8 - 3x) / 2. To graph this line on the Cartesian plane, we can find the x and y-intercepts and then connect them with a straight line.\n\nTo find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x:\n0 = (8 - 3x) / 2\n0 = 8 - 3x\n3x = 8\nx = 8/3\n\nSo, the x-intercept is (8/3, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y:\ny = (8 - 3(0)) / 2\ny = 8 / 2\ny = 4\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 4).\n\nNow, plot the points (8/3, 0) and (0, 4) on the Cartesian plane and connect them with a straight line. This line represents the equation 3x + 2y = 8."
