    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination. First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent, and the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate z by adding the first equation to the third equation:\n\n(2x + 3y - z) + (6x + 9y - 3z) = 1 + 3\n\n8x + 12y - 4z = 4\n\nNow, divide the equation by 4:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 1\n\nThis is the same as the first equation, so we can express z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = 2x + 3y - 1\n\nNow we can express the general solution as:\n\nx = x\ny = y\nz = 2x + 3y - 1\n\nThis means that for any values of x and y, we can find a corresponding value of z that satisfies the system of equations."
