    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In other words, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nWe are given that (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by 77. Since 77 = 7 * 11, we can rewrite the condition as:\n\n(n-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(n-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)\n\nUsing Wilson's theorem, we know that:\n\n(7-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 7)\n(11-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 11)\n\nWhich means:\n\n6! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n10! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies both conditions. Since 6! + 1 is divisible by 7, we can start by checking if it is also divisible by 11:\n\n6! + 1 = 720 + 1 = 721\n\n721 is not divisible by 11, so we move on to the next multiple of 7:\n\n7! + 1 = 5040 + 1 = 5041\n\n5041 is divisible by 11 (5041 = 11 * 458), so the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the given condition is n = 7 + 1 = 8."
