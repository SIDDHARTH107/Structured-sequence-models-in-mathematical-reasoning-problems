    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B, and then find the intersection of the sets A and B. Finally, find the symmetric difference of the intersection of A and B with the set A, and compare the result with the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. Verify that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA Δ B = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B, but not both}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the sets A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements which are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {x: x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of the intersection of A and B with the set A.\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ A = {x: x ∈ (A ∩ B) or x ∈ A, but not both}\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ A = {1, 2, 3} Δ {2, 3} = {1}\n\nNow, let's compare the result with the symmetric difference of the sets A and B.\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ A = {1}\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nSince (A ∩ B) Δ A ≠ A Δ B, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over intersection."
