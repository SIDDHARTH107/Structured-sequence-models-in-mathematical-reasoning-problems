    "message_1": "Suppose there are two bidders in an auction for a unique item. Bidder 1 has a valuation of $500 for the item, while Bidder 2 has a valuation of $400. The auction follows a second-price sealed bid format, meaning the highest bidder wins the item and pays the price of the second-highest bid. If both bidders bid their true valuations, what will be the final price paid for the item?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed bid auction, the highest bidder wins the item and pays the price of the second-highest bid. In this case, Bidder 1 has a valuation of $500 and Bidder 2 has a valuation of $400. Since both bidders bid their true valuations, Bidder 1 will win the auction with a bid of $500. However, they will only pay the price of the second-highest bid, which is $400. Therefore, the final price paid for the item will be $400."
