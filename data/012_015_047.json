    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges. Determine if the graph is connected or not.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a graph is connected if and only if it has at least (n-1) edges, where n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn this case, n = 10, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is (10-1) = 9 edges.\n\nSince the graph G has 15 edges, which is greater than the minimum required number of edges (9), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, we cannot definitively say that the graph is connected without knowing the specific arrangement of the edges. It is possible that the edges are arranged in such a way that the graph is not connected, even though there are enough edges for it to be connected."
