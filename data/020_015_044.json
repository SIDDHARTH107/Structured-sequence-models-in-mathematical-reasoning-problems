    "message_2": "To cut the square metal sheet into four smaller squares of equal area, we can divide the area of the original square by 4.\n\nThe area of the original square is:\nArea = side^2 = 20cm * 20cm = 400 square centimeters\n\nNow, we divide the area by 4 to find the area of each smaller square:\n400 square centimeters / 4 = 100 square centimeters\n\nSo, the largest possible area of each smaller square that can be obtained is 100 square centimeters."
