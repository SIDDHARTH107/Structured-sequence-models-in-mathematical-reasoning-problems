    "message_2": "To find the edge connectivity of a graph, we need to determine the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. The edge connectivity is denoted by λ(G).\n\nMenger's theorem states that the edge connectivity λ(G) is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot directly apply Menger's theorem or determine the exact edge connectivity. We can, however, provide an upper bound for the edge connectivity using the following formula:\n\nλ(G) ≤ min{deg(u) + deg(v) - 2 | uv ∈ E(G)}\n\nwhere deg(u) and deg(v) are the degrees of vertices u and v, and E(G) is the set of edges in the graph.\n\nSince the graph has 20 edges and 12 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in the graph is (2 * 20) / 12 ≈ 3.33. This means that there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less. Let's assume there is a vertex u with a degree of 3. \n\nNow, let's consider the vertex v connected to u with the smallest degree. If v also has a degree of 3, then deg(u) + deg(v) - 2 = 3 + 3 - 2 = 4. In this case, the edge connectivity λ(G) would be at most 4.\n\nIf v has a degree greater than 3, then deg(u) + deg(v) - 2 will be greater than 4, but since u has a degree of 3, removing the 3 edges connected to u would disconnect the graph. So, the edge connectivity λ(G) would still be at most 3.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we can only conclude that the edge connectivity λ(G) is at most 3."
