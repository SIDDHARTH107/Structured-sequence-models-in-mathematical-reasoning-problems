    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges have the same color. We can use Vizing's theorem to find the chromatic index of the graph G.\n\nVizing's theorem states that for any simple, undirected graph G, the chromatic index χ'(G) satisfies the inequality:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nwhere Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph G.\n\nSince G has 8 vertices and 14 edges, the average degree of the vertices in G is:\n\n(2 * 14) / 8 = 3.5\n\nSince the average degree is 3.5, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher. Therefore, Δ(G) ≥ 4.\n\nNow, we need to determine if χ'(G) = Δ(G) or χ'(G) = Δ(G) + 1. To do this, we can use the fact that if a graph has an odd number of vertices with an odd degree, then χ'(G) = Δ(G) + 1.\n\nLet's consider the parity of the degrees of the vertices in G. Since the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges, we have:\n\nsum(degrees) = 2 * 14 = 28\n\nSince 28 is an even number, there must be an even number of vertices with odd degrees in G. Therefore, G does not have an odd number of vertices with odd degrees, and we can conclude that χ'(G) = Δ(G) = 4.\n\nSo, the chromatic index of the graph G is 4."
