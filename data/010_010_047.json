    "message_2": "To apply Morse theory, we first need to find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^4 + y^4 - 4xy$. To do this, we compute the gradient of $f$ and set it equal to the zero vector:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (4x^3 - 4y, 4y^3 - 4x)$.\n\nSetting the gradient equal to the zero vector, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$4x^3 - 4y = 0$,\n$4y^3 - 4x = 0$.\n\nDividing both equations by 4, we get:\n\n$x^3 - y = 0$,\n$y^3 - x = 0$.\n\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n\n$x^3 + y^3 = x + y$.\n\nFactoring the left side, we have:\n\n$(x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = x + y$.\n\nSince $x^2 - xy + y^2 \\geq 0$ for all $x, y$, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. $x + y = 0$, which gives us the critical point $(0,0)$.\n2. $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 1$, which gives us the critical point $(1,1)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of critical points that lie below the level set $f(x,y) = 1/2$. Evaluating $f$ at the critical points, we get:\n\n$f(0,0) = 0^4 + 0^4 - 4(0)(0) = 0$,\n$f(1,1) = 1^4 + 1^4 - 4(1)(1) = -2$.\n\nSince both critical points have function values below the level set $f(x,y) = 1/2$, there are $\\boxed{2}$ critical points of $f$ that lie below this level set."
