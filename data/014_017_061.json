    "message_1": "Suppose you have a ciphertext message which was encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, and you want to apply frequency analysis to decrypt it. The ciphertext message has 600 characters, and the most frequent character is \"W\", which appears 120 times. If E is the most frequent letter in English text and occurs 13 percent of the time, then what letter was most likely substituted for \"W\" in the encryption process?",
    "message_2": "Since \"W\" is the most frequent character in the ciphertext, and E is the most frequent letter in English text, it is likely that \"W\" was substituted for \"E\" in the encryption process."
