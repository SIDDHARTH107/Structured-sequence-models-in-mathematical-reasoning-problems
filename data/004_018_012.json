    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 2x^2 - 7 using the power rule of differentiation, we will apply the power rule to each term individually. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, 3x^4, the derivative is 4 * 3x^(4-1) = 12x^3.\nFor the second term, -5x^3, the derivative is 3 * -5x^(3-1) = -15x^2.\nFor the third term, 2x^2, the derivative is 2 * 2x^(2-1) = 4x.\nFor the fourth term, -7, the derivative is 0, since the derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 15x^2 + 4x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 2x^2 - 7 is f'(x) = 12x^3 - 15x^2 + 4x."
