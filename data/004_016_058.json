    "message_2": "To find the average speed of the car between points A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nIn this case, the total distance is 120 km, and the total time is 2 hours. So the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = 120 km / 2 hours = 60 km/h\n\nNow, let's use the Mean Value Theorem to show that at some point during the journey, the car must have been traveling at exactly 60 km/h. The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at point c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet f(t) represent the position of the car at time t, where t is measured in hours and the position is measured in kilometers. Since the car is traveling from point A to point B, we can say that f(0) = 0 km (the starting position) and f(2) = 120 km (the ending position).\n\nThe average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 2] is:\n\n( f(2) - f(0) ) / (2 - 0) = (120 km - 0 km) / (2 hours - 0 hours) = 60 km/h\n\nSince the car is moving continuously and smoothly over the 2-hour interval, we can assume that the position function f(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 2] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 2). Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the position function at point c is equal to the average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nf'(c) = 60 km/h\n\nThe derivative of the position function, f'(t), represents the instantaneous speed of the car at time t. So, at some point c during the journey (0 < c < 2), the car must have been traveling at exactly 60 km/h."
