If $A$ has complex multiplication by the quadratic imaginary field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$, where $d$ is a negative non-square integer, then prove that $A$ has exactly $d$ endomorphisms.",
    "message_2": "Let $A$ be an Abelian variety of dimension 2 with complex multiplication by the quadratic imaginary field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$. Let $\\text{End}(A)$ denote the ring of endomorphisms of $A$. Since $A$ has complex multiplication, we know that $\\text{End}(A)$ is an order in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$. \n\nRecall that an order is a subring of an algebraic number field that is also a lattice. In particular, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$ of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$ is an order, and $\\text{End}(A)$ is a subring of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$.\n\nNow, we claim that $\\text{End}(A) = \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$. To see this, note that the rank of $\\text{End}(A)$ as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module is at most 4, since the dimension of $A$ is 2. On the other hand, the rank of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$ as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module is 2. Since $\\text{End}(A)$ is a subring of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$, it follows that $\\text{End}(A) = \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$.\n\nNow, we want to count the number of elements in $\\text{End}(A)$. Since $\\text{End}(A) = \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$, it suffices to count the number of elements in $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$. Let $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-d}}{2}$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $\\omega = \\sqrt{-d}$ if $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Then $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$, and the elements of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$ are of the form $a + b\\omega$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe can think of the elements of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}$ as lattice points in the complex plane. The fundamental parallelogram of this lattice is given by the vertices $0, 1, \\omega, 1+\\omega$. The area of this parallelogram is $|\\text{Im}(\\omega)| = \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{2}$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $\\sqrt{d}$ if $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. \n\nNow, consider the endomorphisms of $A$ that map the origin to the origin. These endomorphisms correspond to the lattice points inside the fundamental parallelogram. Since the area of the fundamental parallelogram is equal to the number of lattice points inside it, we conclude that there are exactly $d$ such endomorphisms.\n\nTherefore, $A$ has exactly $d$ endomorphisms."
