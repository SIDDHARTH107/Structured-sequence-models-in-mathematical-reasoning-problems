    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the context of game theory:\n\nSuppose there are two players competing in a game of rock-paper-scissors, and each player has to choose whether to play rock, paper, or scissors. The payoff matrix for this game is:\n\n|         | Rock | Paper | Scissors |\n|---------|------|-------|----------|\n| Rock    | 0    | -1    | 1        |\n| Paper | 1    | 0      | -1       |\n| Scissors | -1   | 1      | 0        |\n\nAssuming both players play perfectly rational strategies, what is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "In the game of rock-paper-scissors, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both players choose each action (rock, paper, or scissors) with equal probability, i.e., 1/3 chance of playing each action. This is because no player can improve their expected payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the opponent's strategy.\n\nIn this case, the Nash equilibrium strategy for both players is to play rock, paper, and scissors with probabilities (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)."
