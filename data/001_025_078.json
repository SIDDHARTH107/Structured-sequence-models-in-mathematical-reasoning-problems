    "message_2": "To solve the complex number equation $z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 13$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(13)}}{2(1)}$$\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 52}}{2}$$\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-36}}{2}$$\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is a complex number, we can rewrite $\\sqrt{-36}$ as $6i$ (since $6i * 6i = -36$). So, the equation becomes:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm 6i}{2}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by dividing both the real and imaginary parts by 2:\n\n$$z = -2 \\pm 3i$$\n\nSo, the two solutions for $z$ are:\n\n$$z_1 = -2 + 3i$$\n$$z_2 = -2 - 3i$$"
