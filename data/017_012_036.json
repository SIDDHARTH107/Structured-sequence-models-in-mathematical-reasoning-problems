    "message_2": "First, let's consider the case where G has an element of order 16. Let a be an element of G with order 16. Then, we can generate a cyclic subgroup H of G by taking powers of a: H = {e, a, a^2, ..., a^15}, where e is the identity element. Since the order of H is 16 and the order of G is also 16, we can conclude that H = G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group generated by a, and is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G does not have an element of order 16. By Sylow's Theorem, G has a subgroup of order 8. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G with order 8. Since the index of P in G is 2, P is a normal subgroup of G. \n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of P. Since P has order 8, it must be either cyclic (isomorphic to C8), or isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, or isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8. However, since G does not have an element of order 16, P cannot be cyclic. Also, P cannot be isomorphic to Q8 because Q8 is non-abelian, and a non-abelian group of order 8 cannot be a normal subgroup of an abelian group of order 16. Therefore, P must be isomorphic to D4.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/P. Since P is a normal subgroup of G with order 8, the quotient group G/P has order 2. Thus, G/P is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2. Let b be an element of G that is not in P, so G/P = {P, bP}. \n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8. The dihedral group D8 is generated by two elements, r and s, with the following relations: r^4 = s^2 = e, and sr = r^(-1)s. We can define a map φ: G → D8 as follows:\n\nφ(a) = r, for a in P\nφ(b) = s\n\nWe will show that φ is an isomorphism. First, we show that φ is a homomorphism:\n\n1. φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) for a, b in P: Since P is isomorphic to D4, the elements of P satisfy the relations of D4, which are also satisfied by the elements of D8. Therefore, φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) for a, b in P.\n\n2. φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) for a in P, b not in P: Since G/P is isomorphic to C2, we have (ab)^2 = e. Thus, φ(ab)^2 = φ(a^2)φ(b)^2 = e, which implies that φ(ab) = r^(-1)s, as required.\n\nNow, we show that φ is bijective:\n\n1. Injectivity: Suppose φ(a) = φ(b) for some a, b in G. Then, either both a and b are in P, or both are not in P. In the first case, since φ is an isomorphism between P and D4, a = b. In the second case, a = bP for some b not in P, which implies a = b.\n\n2. Surjectivity: Since G has order 16 and D8 has order 8, there must be two elements in G that map to each element of D8. Since P has order 8 and is isomorphic to D4, there are exactly two elements in G that map to each element of D4. Moreover, since G/P has order 2, there are exactly two elements in G that map to s.\n\nTherefore, φ is an isomorphism between G and D8, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 16, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16. If G does not have an element of order 16, it is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8."
