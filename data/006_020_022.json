    "message_2": "First, we need to find out how many women are in the community. To do this, we can multiply the total number of people in the community by the percentage of women:\n\n500 people * 60% = 500 * 0.6 = 300 women\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of these women attend the monthly book club meeting. We can do this by multiplying the number of women by the percentage of women who attend the meeting:\n\n300 women * 30% = 300 * 0.3 = 90 women\n\nSo, 90 women can be expected to attend the monthly book club meeting."
