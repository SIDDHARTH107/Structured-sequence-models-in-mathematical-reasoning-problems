    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G with 6 vertices, we need more information about the graph's structure, such as the number of edges or the degree of each vertex. The chromatic polynomial depends on the specific connections between vertices, and without that information, we cannot determine the exact chromatic polynomial.\n\nHowever, we can provide some general information about chromatic polynomials. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a graph G is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of G, where a proper coloring is an assignment of colors to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFor a complete graph K_n, the chromatic polynomial is P(K_n, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1), and for an empty graph E_n, the chromatic polynomial is P(E_n, k) = k^n.\n\nSince G is neither a complete graph nor an empty graph, its chromatic polynomial will be different from these cases. However, without more information about G, we cannot determine the exact chromatic polynomial."
