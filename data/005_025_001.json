    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the mean weight of a bag of potato chips is 10 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.5 ounces. A random sample of 25 bags is selected and their mean weight is found to be 9.8 ounces. Is there enough evidence to suggest that the manufacturer's claim is false at the 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is enough evidence to suggest that the manufacturer's claim is false at the 5% significance level, we will perform a hypothesis test using the z-test for the sample mean.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 10 ounces (The manufacturer's claim is true.)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 10 ounces (The manufacturer's claim is false.)\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance.\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic (z-score).\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nz = (9.8 - 10) / (0.5 / √25)\nz = (-0.2) / (0.5 / 5)\nz = (-0.2) / 0.1\nz = -2\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical z-value.\nSince this is a two-tailed test (H1: μ ≠ 10), we will find the critical z-values for α/2 = 0.025 in each tail.\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find the critical z-values to be -1.96 and 1.96.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical z-values.\nOur test statistic, z = -2, falls in the rejection region (z < -1.96).\n\nStep 6: Make a decision.\nSince the test statistic falls in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence at the 5% significance level to suggest that the manufacturer's claim of a mean weight of 10 ounces is false."
