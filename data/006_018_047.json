    "message_1": "A company has 100 employees, and the probability that any one of them will commit financial fraud is 0.02. What is the probability that at least 2 employees will commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability that at least 2 employees commit financial fraud, we can find the probability that either 0 or 1 employee commits financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet X be the number of employees who commit financial fraud. We can model this situation using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of employees (100), k is the number of employees who commit financial fraud, p is the probability that an employee commits financial fraud (0.02), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\").\n\nFirst, let's find the probability that 0 employees commit financial fraud (k = 0):\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * (0.02)^0 * (1-0.02)^(100-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.98)^100\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.1326\n\nNow, let's find the probability that 1 employee commits financial fraud (k = 1):\n\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (1-0.02)^(100-1)\nP(X = 1) = 100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.3714\n\nNow, we can find the probability that either 0 or 1 employee commits financial fraud:\n\nP(X = 0 or X = 1) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) ≈ 0.1326 + 0.3714 ≈ 0.5040\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that at least 2 employees commit financial fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0 or X = 1) ≈ 1 - 0.5040 ≈ 0.4960\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 employees commit financial fraud is approximately 0.4960 or 49.60%."
