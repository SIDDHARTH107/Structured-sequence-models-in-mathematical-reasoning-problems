The mass moves back and forth along a linear path, and the motion is described by the differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 8x = 0$\n\nwhere x is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n\nIf the mass is initially displaced 0.2 meters from equilibrium and given an initial velocity of 1 meter/second, find the position x(t) of the mass as a function of time t.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first note that the given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution to this type of equation is given by:\n\n$x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t) + B\\sin(\\omega t)$\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation. In this case, the differential equation is:\n\n$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 8x = 0$\n\nComparing this to the standard form, we can see that the angular frequency is:\n\n$\\omega = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$\n\nNow we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions. At t = 0, the mass is initially displaced 0.2 meters from equilibrium, so:\n\n$x(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A$\n\nSince the initial displacement is 0.2 meters, we have:\n\n$A = 0.2$\n\nThe initial velocity is given as 1 meter/second. To find the velocity as a function of time, we differentiate the position function with respect to time:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t) + B\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)$\n\nAt t = 0, the initial velocity is 1 meter/second, so:\n\n$v(0) = -A\\omega\\sin(0) + B\\omega\\cos(0) = B\\omega$\n\nSince the initial velocity is 1 meter/second, we have:\n\n$B\\omega = 1$\n\nWe already know that $\\omega = 2\\sqrt{2}$, so:\n\n$B(2\\sqrt{2}) = 1$\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\n$B = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$\n\nNow we have all the constants, and we can write the position function as:\n\n$x(t) = 0.2\\cos(2\\sqrt{2}t) + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\sin(2\\sqrt{2}t)$"
