Divide the larger number (120) by the smaller number (84) and find the remainder.\n   120 รท 84 = 1 with a remainder of 36.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (120) with the smaller number (84) and the smaller number with the remainder (36).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 84 and 36.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (84) by the new smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n   84 รท 36 = 2 with a remainder of 12.\n\n4. Replace the larger number (84) with the smaller number (36) and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 36 and 12.\n\n5. Divide the new larger number (36) by the new smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n   36 รท 12 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12. So, the GCD of 120 and 84 is 12."
