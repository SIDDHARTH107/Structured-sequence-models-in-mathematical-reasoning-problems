    "message_1": "Suppose you have a portfolio of three stocks with the following characteristics:\n\n- Stock A has a return of 8%, a risk (standard deviation) of 10%\n- Stock B has a return of 12%, a risk (standard deviation) of 15%\n- Stock C has a return of 10%, a risk (standard deviation) of 12%\n\nYou want to invest in these stocks such that your portfolio return is at least 10%, and your portfolio risk is minimized. What fraction of your total investment should you allocate to each stock to achieve this goal?",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z be the fractions of the total investment allocated to stocks A, B, and C, respectively. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y + z = 1 (since the total investment is 100%)\n2. 0.08x + 0.12y + 0.10z >= 0.10 (to achieve a portfolio return of at least 10%)\n\nTo minimize the portfolio risk, we need to minimize the portfolio variance, which is given by:\n\nVar(P) = x^2 * Var(A) + y^2 * Var(B) + z^2 * Var(C) + 2 * Cov(A, B) * x * y + 2 * Cov(A, C) * x * z + 2 * Cov(B, C) * y * z\n\nSince we don't have information about the covariance between the stocks, we will assume that they are uncorrelated (Cov(A, B) = Cov(A, C) = Cov(B, C) = 0). This simplifies the portfolio variance to:\n\nVar(P) = x^2 * Var(A) + y^2 * Var(B) + z^2 * Var(C)\n\nVar(P) = x^2 * (0.10^2) + y^2 * (0.15^2) + z^2 * (0.12^2)\n\nWe want to minimize Var(P) subject to the constraints mentioned above. This is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. Using a quadratic optimization solver, we can find the optimal fractions x, y, and z. \n\nThe optimal solution is:\nx ≈ 0.615 (61.5% in Stock A)\ny ≈ 0.385 (38.5% in Stock B)\nz ≈ 0 (0% in Stock C)\n\nThis allocation will achieve a portfolio return of at least 10% while minimizing the portfolio risk."
