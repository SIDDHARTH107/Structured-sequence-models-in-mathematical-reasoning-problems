    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n2 & 4 & -6 & 8 \\\\\n3 & 6 & -9 & 12\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we'll perform the Gauss-Jordan elimination method:\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by the leading coefficient (1):\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n2 & 4 & -6 & 8 \\\\\n3 & 6 & -9 & 12\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the leading coefficient of the second and third rows by subtracting multiples of the first row:\n\nSubtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 6 & -9 & 12\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nSubtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can express the remaining variables in terms of the free variable, z:\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n$x + 2y - 3z = 4$\n\nExpress x in terms of y and z:\n\n$x = 4 - 2y + 3z$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\n$(x, y, z) = (4 - 2y + 3z, y, z)$\n\nWhere y and z can be any real numbers."
