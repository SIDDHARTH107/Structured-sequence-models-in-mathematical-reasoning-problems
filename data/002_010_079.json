    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon, you simply multiply the length of one side by the number of sides. In this case, each side measures 8 cm, and there are 6 sides in a hexagon.\n\nPerimeter = (side length) × (number of sides)\nPerimeter = 8 cm × 6\nPerimeter = 48 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular hexagon is 48 cm."
