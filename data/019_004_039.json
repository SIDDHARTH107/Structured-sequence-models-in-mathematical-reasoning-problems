    "message_2": "To determine whether the given statement is true or false, let's first understand the meaning of the temporal logic operators:\n\n- $\\lozenge p$: \"Eventually $p$\" or \"Sometime in the future, $p$ is true\"\n- $\\Box q$: \"Always $q$\" or \"At all times after the current time, $q$ is true\"\n- $\\Box r$: \"Always $r$\" or \"At all times after the current time, $r$ is true\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statement:\n\n$$(\\lozenge p \\land \\Box q) \\rightarrow \\Box r$$\n\nThis statement can be read as: \"If it rains sometime in the future and the grass is wet at all times after it rains, then the grass is always wet.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If it never rains in the future, the premise $(\\lozenge p \\land \\Box q)$ is false, and a false premise implies a true or false conclusion. In this case, the statement is true.\n\n2. If it rains sometime in the future and the grass is wet at all times after it rains, then the grass is always wet. In this case, the premise $(\\lozenge p \\land \\Box q)$ is true, and the conclusion $\\Box r$ is also true. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nIn both scenarios, the given statement is true. Therefore, the statement $$(\\lozenge p \\land \\Box q) \\rightarrow \\Box r$$ is true."
