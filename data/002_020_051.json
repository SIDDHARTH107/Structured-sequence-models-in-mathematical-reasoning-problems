    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 10 meters. What is the perimeter of a sector formed by an angle of 45 degrees in the circle? Keep the answer in terms of pi.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (angle/360) * 2 * pi * radius\n\nIn this case, the angle is 45 degrees and the radius is 10 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (45/360) * 2 * pi * 10\nArc length = (1/8) * 20 * pi\nArc length = (20/8) * pi\nArc length = (5/2) * pi meters\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii (each 10 meters) to the arc length:\n\nPerimeter of the sector = arc length + 2 * radius\nPerimeter of the sector = (5/2) * pi + 2 * 10\nPerimeter of the sector = (5/2) * pi + 20 meters"
