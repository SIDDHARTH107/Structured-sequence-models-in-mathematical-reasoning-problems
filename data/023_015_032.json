    "message_1": "Here's a question for a mathematics student to solve:\n\nA square wave signal f(t) with a frequency of 5 Hz and an amplitude of 10 V is transmitted along a 100-meter-long transmission line with a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. If the Fourier transform of the signal is given by F(w), determine the expression for the current in the transmission line, and find the attenuation of the signal after it has propagated through the transmission line.",
    "message_2": "To find the expression for the current in the transmission line, we first need to determine the Fourier series representation of the given square wave signal f(t). A square wave with a frequency of 5 Hz and an amplitude of 10 V can be represented as:\n\nf(t) = 10 * ∑[ (2n-1)^(-1) * sin((2n-1) * 2π * 5 * t) ], where the summation is over all odd integers n.\n\nNext, we need to find the Fourier transform F(w) of the square wave signal f(t). Using the Fourier transform formula:\n\nF(w) = ∫[ f(t) * e^(-j * w * t) ] dt, where the integral is over the entire time domain.\n\nSubstituting the square wave representation into the Fourier transform formula:\n\nF(w) = ∫[ 10 * ∑( (2n-1)^(-1) * sin((2n-1) * 2π * 5 * t) ) * e^(-j * w * t) ] dt\n\nNow, we can find the expression for the current in the transmission line. The voltage across the transmission line is given by the square wave signal, and the characteristic impedance is 50 ohms. Using Ohm's law:\n\nI(t) = V(t) / Z0\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nI(t) = f(t) / 50\n\nNow, we need to find the attenuation of the signal after it has propagated through the transmission line. The attenuation of a signal in a transmission line is given by:\n\nα = (8.686 * R * L * C * f)^(1/2)\n\nwhere α is the attenuation in dB/m, R is the resistance per unit length, L is the inductance per unit length, C is the capacitance per unit length, and f is the frequency of the signal.\n\nHowever, we are not given the values of R, L, and C for the transmission line. Therefore, we cannot calculate the attenuation of the signal in this case."
