The first department requires $20,000, the second department requires $30,000, and the third department requires $40,000. The profit generated by the first department is $50,000, by the second department is $60,000 and by the third department is $70,000. Determine the optimal allocation of resources that maximizes the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal allocation of resources, we need to calculate the profit per dollar invested in each department. \n\nProfit per dollar for Department 1:\n$50,000 / $20,000 = $2.50\n\nProfit per dollar for Department 2:\n$60,000 / $30,000 = $2.00\n\nProfit per dollar for Department 3:\n$70,000 / $40,000 = $1.75\n\nDepartment 1 has the highest profit per dollar, followed by Department 2, and then Department 3. To maximize the company's profit, the company should allocate its budget in the following way:\n\n1. Allocate $20,000 to Department 1, which will generate $50,000 in profit.\n2. Allocate $30,000 to Department 2, which will generate $60,000 in profit.\n3. Allocate the remaining $50,000 ($100,000 - $20,000 - $30,000) to Department 3, which will generate $87,500 in profit (since the profit per dollar is $1.75, we multiply $50,000 * $1.75).\n\nThe total profit generated by this allocation will be $50,000 + $60,000 + $87,500 = $197,500."
