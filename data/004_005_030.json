    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation y' + 3y = 6 with the initial condition y(0) = 2, we will use an integrating factor.\n\nFirst, rewrite the differential equation in the standard form: y' + 3y = 6.\n\nThe integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y, which is 3 in this case:\n\nIntegrating factor = e^(∫3 dx) = e^(3x).\n\nNow, multiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(3x)(y' + 3y) = 6e^(3x).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nd/dx (ye^(3x)) = 6e^(3x).\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(d/dx (ye^(3x))) dx = ∫(6e^(3x)) dx.\n\nThis gives:\n\nye^(3x) = 2e^(3x) + C.\n\nNow, divide by e^(3x) to isolate y:\n\ny(x) = 2 + Ce^(-3x).\n\nTo find the constant C, use the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = 2 + Ce^(-3*0).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2 = 2 + C.\n\nThus, C = 0.\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = 2."
