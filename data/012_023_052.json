    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. In the given graph G=(V,E), with V={1,2,3,4,5} and E={{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{3,4},{4,5}}, we can identify the cliques:\n\n1. {1,2,3} is a clique of size 3, as all three vertices are connected to each other.\n2. {3,4} is a clique of size 2.\n3. {4,5} is a clique of size 2.\n\nThere are no cliques of size 4 or 5 in the graph. Therefore, the clique number of the given graph is 3."
