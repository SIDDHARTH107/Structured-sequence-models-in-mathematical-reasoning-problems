    "message_1": "A factory has 300 employees working in the packaging department. The probability of an employee being involved in a workplace accident during a shift is 0.05. What is the probability that out of 300 employees, exactly 15 employees will be involved in accidents during their shifts?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, accidents) out of n trials (employees)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (accident) for each trial (employee), which is 0.05\n- n is the number of trials (employees), which is 300\n- k is the number of successes (accidents) we want to find the probability for, which is 15\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 15) = C(300, 15) * (0.05)^15 * (1-0.05)^(300-15)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(300, 15):\n\nC(300, 15) = 300! / (15!(300-15)!)\nC(300, 15) = 300! / (15! * 285!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 15) = C(300, 15) * (0.05)^15 * (0.95)^285\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 15) â‰ˆ 0.109\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 15 employees will be involved in accidents during their shifts is approximately 10.9%."
