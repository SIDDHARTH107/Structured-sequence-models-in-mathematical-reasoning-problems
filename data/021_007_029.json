    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nWe'll start with an initial guess of x_0 = 2 and iterate until the result is accurate to 4 decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - f(x_0) / f'(x_0)\nx_1 = 2 - (2^3 - 2*2 - 5) / (3*(2^2) - 2)\nx_1 = 2 - (8 - 4 - 5) / (12 - 2)\nx_1 = 2 - (-1) / 10\nx_1 = 2.1\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = x_1 - f(x_1) / f'(x_1)\nx_2 = 2.1 - (2.1^3 - 2*2.1 - 5) / (3*(2.1^2) - 2)\nx_2 ≈ 2.0952\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 = x_2 - f(x_2) / f'(x_2)\nx_3 = 2.0952 - (2.0952^3 - 2*2.0952 - 5) / (3*(2.0952^2) - 2)\nx_3 ≈ 2.0951\n\nSince the result has not changed after the third iteration to 4 decimal places, we can conclude that the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x=2 is approximately x ≈ 2.0951."
