    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve, and its perimeter increases with each order. The perimeter of a Hilbert curve of order $n$ with a side length of $s$ units can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = $4^n * s$\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order $n=3$ with a side length of $s=100$ units, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:\n\nPerimeter = $4^3 * 100$\n\nPerimeter = $64 * 100$\n\nPerimeter = $6400$ units\n\nSo, the perimeter of a Hilbert curve of order $n=3$ with a side length of $s=100$ units is 6400 units."
