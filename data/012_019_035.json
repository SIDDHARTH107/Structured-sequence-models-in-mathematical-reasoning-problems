    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree (Δ) of the graph. The maximum degree is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex.\n\nVertex 1: degree 4\nVertex 2: degree 4\nVertex 3: degree 4\nVertex 4: degree 4\nVertex 5: degree 3\nVertex 6: degree 4\nVertex 7: degree 4\nVertex 8: degree 3\nVertex 9: degree 3\n\nThe maximum degree (Δ) of the graph is 4.\n\nAccording to Vizing's Theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G satisfies:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nIn our case, Δ(G) = 4, so the chromatic index χ'(G) must be either 4 or 5.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges of the graph using 4 colors. We can use the following edge coloring:\n\n```\n   1-----2       5\n  1|\\   /|2     1/ \\\n   | \\ / |      /   \\\n   |  X  |     /     \\\n   | / \\ |    2-------3\n  2|/   \\|1   |       |\n   3-----4    4-------5\n```\n\nColoring:\n1-2: 1\n1-3: 2\n1-4: 3\n1-5: 4\n2-3: 3\n2-4: 2\n2-6: 4\n3-4: 1\n3-7: 4\n4-8: 4\n5-6: 1\n5-7: 2\n6-7: 3\n6-8: 2\n7-9: 4\n8-9: 3\n\nWe have successfully colored the edges of the graph using 4 colors, and no two adjacent edges have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of this graph is 4."
