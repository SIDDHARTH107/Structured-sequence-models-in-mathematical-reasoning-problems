    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to Block ciphers:\n\nSuppose you have a 64-bit block cipher encryption key and you want to use it to encrypt a 128-bit message using the Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode of operation. How many blocks of size 64-bit will you have in the resulting ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt a 128-bit message using a 64-bit block cipher in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, you would divide the message into two 64-bit blocks. Therefore, the resulting ciphertext will have 2 blocks of size 64-bit each."
