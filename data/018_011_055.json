The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C, which is represented by (A ∩ B) x C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A ∩ B) x C = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product (A ∩ B) x C is {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6)}."
