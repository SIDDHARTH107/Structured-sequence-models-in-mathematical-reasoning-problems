The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA = {1, 3, 5}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of A and B: A ∩ B = {3}\n\nNow, let's find the elements that are in A or B but not in their intersection:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 4, 5} (we exclude the element 3, which is in the intersection)\n\nNow, we need to find the union of (A Δ B) and B:\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 4, 5} ∪ {2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSo, (A Δ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}."
