    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\n1. First, parameterize the surface:\nLet x = u and y = v, then the surface can be parameterized as:\nr(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\n2. Compute the first fundamental form:\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nCompute the metric coefficients:\nE = <ru, ru> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <ru, rv> = 2uv\nG = <rv, rv> = 1 + 4v^2\n\n3. Compute the second fundamental form:\nruu = d^2r/du^2 = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = d^2r/dudv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = d^2r/dv^2 = (0, 0, 2)\n\nCompute the shape coefficients:\nL = <ruu, n> = (2 - 4u^2) / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = <ruv, n> = -2uv / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nN = <rvv, n> = (2 - 4v^2) / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\n4. Compute the principal curvatures:\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u = 1 and v = 1.\nE = 5, F = 1, G = 5\nL = -1/3, M = -1/3, N = -1/3\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) using the formula:\n\nk1, k2 = (L + N)/2 ± sqrt(((L - N)/2)^2 + M^2) / sqrt(EG - F^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nk1, k2 = (-2/3) ± sqrt((0)^2 + (-1/3)^2) / sqrt(5^2 - 1^2)\nk1, k2 = (-2/3) ± sqrt(1/9) / 4\n\nSo, the principal curvatures are:\n\nk1 = (-2/3) + sqrt(1/9) / 4 = -1/3\nk2 = (-2/3) - sqrt(1/9) / 4 = -1\n\nThus, the principal curvatures of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) are k1 = -1/3 and k2 = -1."
