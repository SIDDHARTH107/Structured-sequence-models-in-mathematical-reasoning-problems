    "message_2": "Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can find the number of students who play both football and basketball.\n\nLet A be the set of students who play football, and B be the set of students who like basketball.\n\n|A| = 25 (number of students who play football)\n|B| = 30 (number of students who like basketball)\n\nWe know that the total number of students is 40, so:\n\n|A ∪ B| = 40\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have:\n\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|\n\nWhere |A ∩ B| is the number of students who play both football and basketball.\n\nNow, we can solve for |A ∩ B|:\n\n40 = 25 + 30 - |A ∩ B|\n40 = 55 - |A ∩ B|\n|A ∩ B| = 55 - 40\n|A ∩ B| = 15\n\nSo, 15 students play both football and basketball."
