    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression $\\log_3(81)-\\log_3(27)$, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that $\\log_b(a) - \\log_b(c) = \\log_b(\\frac{a}{c})$. Applying this rule, we get:\n\n$\\log_3(81)-\\log_3(27) = \\log_3(\\frac{81}{27})$\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction inside the logarithm:\n\n$\\log_3(\\frac{81}{27}) = \\log_3(3)$\n\nSince $\\log_3(3)$ is asking \"to what power must we raise 3 to get 3?\", the answer is 1, because $3^1 = 3$. Therefore,\n\n$\\log_3(81)-\\log_3(27) = \\log_3(3) = \\boxed{1}$."
