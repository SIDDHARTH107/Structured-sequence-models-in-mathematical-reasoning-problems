Identity transformation:\nThe identity transformation leaves the sphere unchanged. The matrix representation in homogeneous coordinates is:\n\nI = | 1 0 0 0 |\n    | 0 1 0 0 |\n    | 0 0 1 0 |\n    | 0 0 0 1 |\n\n2.

Note that combinations of these transformations (e.g., rotations followed by reflections or rotations around different axes) will also be symmetries of the sphere."
