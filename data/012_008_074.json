    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar, we can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 6 vertices with each partition having 3 vertices).\n\nIn the given graph, we can observe that it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K3,3. The subgraph can be formed with the following vertices and edges:\n\nVertices: A, B, C, D, E, F\nEdges: AB, AC, AD, BE, BF, CF, DE, DF, EF\n\nThis subgraph is a subdivision of K3,3, where the partitions are {A, B, C} and {D, E, F}. Therefore, the given graph is not planar."
