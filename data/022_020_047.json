    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using the method of images, we first note that the region is a half-disk centered at 3 with radius 2 in the complex plane. Let z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers.\n\nWe can use the method of images by considering a harmonic function u(z) that satisfies Laplace's equation and the given boundary conditions. We can construct such a function using the complex potential.\n\nLet w(z) be the complex potential, where u(z) = Re(w(z)). We can use the method of images by considering a point charge at z = 3 + 2i and its image charge at z = 3 - 2i. The complex potential due to these charges is given by:\n\nw(z) = k * log((z - (3 + 2i))(z - (3 - 2i)))\n\nwhere k is a constant to be determined. Now, we can find u(z) by taking the real part of w(z):\n\nu(z) = Re(w(z)) = k * Re(log((z - (3 + 2i))(z - (3 - 2i))))\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the boundary conditions. First, let's consider the condition u(x,0) = 0:\n\nu(x,0) = k * Re(log((x - 3 + 2i)(x - 3 - 2i))) = k * Re(log((x - 3)^2 + 4)) = 0\n\nSince log((x - 3)^2 + 4) is never zero, we must have k = 0. However, this would result in a trivial solution u(z) = 0, which does not satisfy the second boundary condition.\n\nTo satisfy the second boundary condition, we need to modify our complex potential. Let's add a constant term to w(z):\n\nw(z) = k * log((z - (3 + 2i))(z - (3 - 2i))) + C\n\nNow, as |z - 3| → 2+, we have:\n\nu(z) → Re(C) = 1\n\nSo, we can choose C = 1 + 0i. Thus, the complex potential is:\n\nw(z) = k * log((z - (3 + 2i))(z - (3 - 2i))) + 1\n\nNow, we need to determine the constant k. Since u(z) = Re(w(z)), we have:\n\nu(z) = k * Re(log((z - (3 + 2i))(z - (3 - 2i)))) + 1\n\nWe can determine k by considering the boundary condition u(x,0) = 0:\n\n0 = k * Re(log((x - 3)^2 + 4)) + 1\n\nWe can choose k = -1/Re(log(4)) to satisfy this condition. Therefore, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\nu(z) = -1/Re(log(4)) * Re(log((z - (3 + 2i))(z - (3 - 2i)))) + 1"
