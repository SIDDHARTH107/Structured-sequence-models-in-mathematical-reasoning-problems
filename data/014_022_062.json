    "message_2": "To encrypt a message using the Playfair cipher, we first need to create a 5x5 grid using the keyword and the English alphabet (excluding the letter 'J', which is usually combined with 'I').\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the keyword: MATH -> MATH\n2. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the keyword followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet:\n\n   M  A  T  H  B\n   C  D  E  F  G\n   I  K  L  N  O\n   P  Q  R  S  U\n   V  W  X  Y  Z\n\n3. Break the plaintext message into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them: ME ET ME AT FO UR -> ME ET ME AT FX OU R\n4. For each pair of letters, apply the following rules:\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its right (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter below it (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each with the letter in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nApplying these rules to the pairs, we get the encrypted message:\n\nME -> OD\nET -> GT\nME -> OD\nAT -> MC\nFX -> IN\nOU -> KI\nR -> R (single letter, no change)\n\nEncrypted message: ODGTODMCINKIR\n\nTo decrypt the message, we apply the reverse rules:\n\n1. For each pair of letters, apply the following rules:\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its left (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter above it (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each with the letter in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nApplying these rules to the encrypted pairs, we get the decrypted message:\n\nOD -> ME\nGT -> ET\nOD -> ME\nMC -> AT\nIN -> FX\nKI -> OU\nR -> R (single letter, no change)\n\nDecrypted message: MEETMEATFXOUR\n\nSince 'X' was inserted between the original letters, we can remove it to get the original plaintext message: MEET ME AT FOUR."
