    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's Triangle, we need to find the number of combinations of choosing 3 people from a group of 7. This can be represented as C(7,3) or 7 choose 3.\n\nPascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top, and the outer edges of the triangle are always 1. The entries in Pascal's Triangle represent the number of combinations for a given row and position.\n\nHere's a representation of Pascal's Triangle up to row 7:\n\n```\n          1\n         1 1\n        1 2 1\n       1 3 3 1\n      1 4 6 4 1\n     1 5 10 10 5 1\n    1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n```\n\nTo find the value of C(7,3), we look at the 7th row (starting from row 0) and the 3rd position (starting from position 0). In this case, the value is 35.\n\nSo, there are 35 ways to choose a team of 3 people from a group of 7 people using Pascal's Triangle."
