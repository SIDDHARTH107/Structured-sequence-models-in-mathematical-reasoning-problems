    "message_2": "To find the global minimum value of the convex function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1, we can use the first and second derivative tests.\n\nFirst, find the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 + 2x + 1) = 2x + 2\n\nNow, set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x + 2 = 0\n2x = -2\nx = -1\n\nNow, find the second derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (x^2 + 2x + 1) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, this means that the function is convex and has a global minimum at x = -1.\n\nNow, find the value of the function at this point:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\n\nTherefore, the global minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 is 0."
