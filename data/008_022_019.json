    "message_2": "First, let's find the condition number of the matrix to check if it is ill-conditioned. The condition number is the ratio of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value of a matrix. A large condition number indicates that the matrix is ill-conditioned and may lead to numerical instability when solving the system of equations.\n\nThe matrix A is:\n\nA = |  3    2   -1 |\n    |  6    4   -2 |\n    |  9  6.001 -3 |\n\nTo find the condition number, we first need to find the singular values of A. We can do this by finding the eigenvalues of A^T * A, where A^T is the transpose of A.\n\nA^T * A = | 126    84    -42  |\n          |  84  56.004 -28.002|\n          | -42 -28.002  14.001|\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues of A^T * A:\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n| 126 - λ    84      -42    |\n|   84    56.004 - λ -28.002|\n|  -42   -28.002   14.001 - λ|\n\nDet(A^T * A - λI) = λ^3 - 196.005λ^2 + 384.120024λ - 248.016\n\nThe eigenvalues are approximately λ1 = 0.00016, λ2 = 0.00484, and λ3 = 196.00000.\n\nNow, we can find the singular values by taking the square root of the eigenvalues:\n\nσ1 ≈ 0.01266, σ2 ≈ 0.06957, and σ3 ≈ 14.00000.\n\nThe condition number is the ratio of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value:\n\nCondition number ≈ σ3 / σ1 ≈ 14.00000 / 0.01266 ≈ 1105.53\n\nSince the condition number is large, the matrix A is ill-conditioned, and solving the system of equations using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting may lead to numerical instability.\n\nHowever, we will proceed with Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting to demonstrate the process.\n\n1. First, we will pivot the matrix to ensure the largest absolute value is in the first row:\n\nPivoted matrix:\n\n|  9  6.001 -3 |\n|  6    4   -2 |\n|  3    2   -1 |\n\n2. Perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R1\n\n|  9  6.001 -3 |\n|  0  0.001  0 |\n|  0    0    0 |\n\nSince the third row has all zeros, we have an underdetermined system. There are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations, and Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting cannot provide a unique solution."
