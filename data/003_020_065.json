    "message_1": "A building is 40 meters tall. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 60 degrees. What is the distance between the base of the building and the ground point (to the nearest meter)?",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (40 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance between the base of the building and the ground point (which we will call x).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = 40/x\n\nTo find x, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 40/tan(60°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of tan(60°), which is √3:\n\nx = 40/√3\n\nTo get the distance to the nearest meter, we can approximate the value of x:\n\nx ≈ 40/(1.732) ≈ 23.094\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the distance between the base of the building and the ground point is approximately 23 meters."
