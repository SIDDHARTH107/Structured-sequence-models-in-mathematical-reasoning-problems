    "message_2": "The logistic map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) represents the population at time step n, and r is a parameter that controls the growth rate and behavior of the system.\n\nThe behavior of the logistic map shifts from a stable fixed point to a cycle of two values at the first bifurcation point. This occurs when the parameter r reaches the value of 3.\n\nAt r = 3, the logistic map transitions from a single stable fixed point to oscillating between two values, marking the onset of more complex behavior in the system."
