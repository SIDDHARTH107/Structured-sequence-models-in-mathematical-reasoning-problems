    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the constant column vector.\n\nThe given system can be represented as:\n\nA = |  5   2  -1 |\n    |  1  -4   6 |\n    |  3   7  -5 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  12  |\n    | -22  |\n    |   6  |\n\nNow, we will convert the matrix A into a sparse matrix representation. Since all the elements in the matrix A are non-zero, the sparse matrix representation will be the same as the original matrix A.\n\nNext, we will solve the matrix equation Ax = b using a suitable method, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule. In this case, we will use Gaussian elimination.\n\n1. Swap the first and second rows to make the pivot element 1:\n\nA = |  1  -4   6 |\n    |  5   2  -1 |\n    |  3   7  -5 |\n\nb = | -22  |\n    |  12  |\n    |   6  |\n\n2. Perform row operations to make the elements below the pivot element 0:\n\nR2 = R2 - 5 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\nA = |  1  -4   6  |\n    |  0  22 -29 |\n    |  0  19 -23 |\n\nb = | -22  |\n    | 122  |\n    |  72  |\n\n3. Divide the second row by the pivot element 22:\n\nA = |  1  -4   6  |\n    |  0   1 -29/22 |\n    |  0  19 -23 |\n\nb = | -22   |\n    |  11/2 |\n    |  72   |\n\n4. Perform row operations to make the elements below and above the second pivot element 0:\n\nR1 = R1 + 4 * R2\nR3 = R3 - 19 * R2\n\nA = |  1   0  22/11 |\n    |  0   1 -29/22 |\n    |  0   0   1    |\n\nb = | -11  |\n    | 11/2 |\n    |  -2  |\n\n5. Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = -2\ny = 11/2 + 29/22 * z = 11/2 + 29/22 * (-2) = 1\nx = -11 - 22/11 * z - 4 * y = -11 - 22/11 * (-2) - 4 * 1 = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 1, and z = -2."
