    "message_1": "A rocket is launched into the air with an initial height of 30 meters above the ground. Its height can be modeled by the quadratic equation h = -5t^2 + 30t + 10, where h is the height of the rocket in meters after t seconds. At what time will the rocket hit the ground?",
    "message_2": "To find the time when the rocket hits the ground, we need to find the value of t when the height h is equal to 0 (since the ground is at 0 height). So, we need to solve the equation:\n\n0 = -5t^2 + 30t + 10\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by dividing all terms by -5:\n\n0 = t^2 - 6t - 2\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation. Since it's not easily factorable, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nt = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -6, and c = -2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nt = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\n\nt = (6 ± √(36 + 8)) / 2\n\nt = (6 ± √44) / 2\n\nt = (6 ± 2√11) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions: t = (6 + 2√11) / 2 and t = (6 - 2√11) / 2. However, since time cannot be negative, we can discard the second solution. Therefore, the rocket will hit the ground at:\n\nt = (6 + 2√11) / 2 ≈ 4.27 seconds"
