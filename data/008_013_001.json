    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A = [[2, 1, 3], [5, -4, 1], [1, 3, -2]], X = [[x], [y], [z]], and B = [[7], [-19], [-5]].\n\nStep 1: LU decomposition of matrix A\n\nWe can perform LU decomposition using the Doolittle algorithm. \n\nL = [[1, 0, 0], [l21, 1, 0], [l31, l32, 1]]\nU = [[u11, u12, u13], [0, u22, u23], [0, 0, u33]]\n\nApplying the Doolittle algorithm:\n\nu11 = 2\nu12 = 1\nu13 = 3\n\nl21 = 5 / 2 = 2.5\nu22 = -4 - (2.5 * 1) = -6\nu23 = 1 - (2.5 * 3) = -6.5\n\nl31 = 1 / 2 = 0.5\nl32 = (3 - (0.5 * 1)) / -6 = -0.5\nu33 = -2 - (0.5 * 3) - (-0.5 * -6.5) = -3\n\nSo, L = [[1, 0, 0], [2.5, 1, 0], [0.5, -0.5, 1]] and U = [[2, 1, 3], [0, -6, -6.5], [0, 0, -3]].\n\nStep 2: Solve L * Y = B for Y\n\nLet Y = [[y1], [y2], [y3]], then we have the following system of equations:\n\ny1 = 7\n2.5y1 + y2 = -19\n0.5y1 - 0.5y2 + y3 = -5\n\nSolving for y1, y2, and y3:\n\ny1 = 7\ny2 = -19 - 2.5y1 = -19 - 2.5 * 7 = -36.5\ny3 = -5 - 0.5y1 + 0.5y2 = -5 - 0.5 * 7 + 0.5 * (-36.5) = 3\n\nSo, Y = [[7], [-36.5], [3]].\n\nStep 3: Solve U * X = Y for X\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n2x + y + 3z = 7\n-6y - 6.5z = -36.5\n-3z = 3\n\nSolving for x, y, and z:\n\nz = -1\ny = (-36.5 + 6.5 * z) / -6 = (-36.5 + 6.5 * -1) / -6 = 6\nx = (7 - y - 3 * z) / 2 = (7 - 6 - 3 * -1) / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2, y = 6, and z = -1."
