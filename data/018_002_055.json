The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A. To do this, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A. The elements in A ∩ B are {3, 4, 5}, and we can see that all of these elements are also in A:\n\n3 ∈ A, 4 ∈ A, and 5 ∈ A\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNext, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of B.
