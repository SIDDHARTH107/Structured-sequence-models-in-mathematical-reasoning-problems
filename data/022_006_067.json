    "message_2": "The Maximum Modulus Principle states that if a function is holomorphic (analytic and has a continuous derivative) inside and on a closed curve, then the maximum of the modulus of the function on the curve occurs on the boundary of the curve.\n\nThe function $f(z) = z^3 - 2z + 1$ is a polynomial, so it is holomorphic everywhere. The curve $C$ is the circle $|z - 2| = 3$. To find the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on $C$, we can parameterize the curve and then maximize the modulus of the function.\n\nLet $z = 2 + 3e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = (2 + 3e^{i\\theta})^3 - 2(2 + 3e^{i\\theta}) + 1$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = -23 + 12e^{i\\theta} + 27e^{2i\\theta} + 18e^{3i\\theta}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of $|f(z)|$:\n\n$$|f(z)| = |-23 + 12e^{i\\theta} + 27e^{2i\\theta} + 18e^{3i\\theta}|$$\n\nTo find the maximum value of this expression, we can use the fact that the maximum value of the modulus of a sum of complex numbers is less than or equal to the sum of the moduli of the individual complex numbers:\n\n$$|f(z)| \\le |-23| + |12e^{i\\theta}| + |27e^{2i\\theta}| + |18e^{3i\\theta}|$$\n\nSince the moduli of the exponential terms are 1, we have:\n\n$$|f(z)| \\le 23 + 12 + 27 + 18 = 80$$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $\\theta$ for which this maximum is achieved. We can do this by considering the angle between the vectors formed by the complex numbers in the sum. When the angle between the vectors is 180 degrees, the sum of the moduli is maximized.\n\nBy inspection, we can see that the angle between the vectors formed by the complex numbers $-23$, $12e^{i\\theta}$, $27e^{2i\\theta}$, and $18e^{3i\\theta}$ is 180 degrees when $\\theta = \\pi$. In this case, the sum of the moduli is indeed 80.\n\nSo, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on $C$ is 80, and the corresponding value of $z$ is $2 + 3e^{i\\pi} = 2 - 3 = -1$."
