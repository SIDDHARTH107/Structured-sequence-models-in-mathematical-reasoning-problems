    "message_1": "Sorry, but it is not possible to write a numerical problem for the topic \"Non-monotonic Logic.\" Non-monotonic logic is a type of logic that does not follow the usual truth-preserving rules of standard logic, so it is not directly related to numerical problems. \n\nHowever, here is an example of a question related to Non-monotonic logic that a math student could solve:\n\nWhat are some real-world applications of non-monotonic logic in Artificial Intelligence, and how can it be used to deal with uncertainty and incomplete information?",
    "message_2": "Some real-world applications of non-monotonic logic in Artificial Intelligence include:\n\n1. Expert systems: Non-monotonic logic can be used to model the reasoning process of human experts, who often deal with incomplete or uncertain information. By incorporating non-monotonic logic, expert systems can draw conclusions based on the available information and update their knowledge as new information becomes available.\n\n2. Default reasoning: Non-monotonic logic is used in default reasoning, where conclusions are drawn based on typical or default assumptions. For example, if we know that birds typically fly, we can assume that a newly discovered bird species can fly unless we have evidence to the contrary.\n\n3. Commonsense reasoning: Non-monotonic logic is useful for modeling commonsense reasoning, which involves making inferences based on general knowledge and everyday experiences. Commonsense reasoning often involves dealing with incomplete information and making assumptions based on what is typically true.\n\n4. Planning and decision-making: In AI planning and decision-making, non-monotonic logic can be used to represent and reason about the effects of actions and the uncertainty of the environment. This allows AI systems to make informed decisions based on the available information and update their plans as new information becomes available.\n\n5. Knowledge representation and reasoning: Non-monotonic logic can be used to represent and reason about incomplete or uncertain information in knowledge bases. This is particularly useful in AI systems that need to reason about the world and make decisions based on incomplete or uncertain information.\n\nIn summary, non-monotonic logic is a valuable tool in Artificial Intelligence for dealing with uncertainty and incomplete information. It allows AI systems to make reasonable inferences based on the available information and update their knowledge and reasoning as new information becomes available."
