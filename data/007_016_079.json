To find the Sophie Germain primes between 1 and 100, we first need to list the prime numbers in that range:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\nNow, we'll check if 2p + 1 is prime for each of these numbers:\n\n2: 2(2) + 1 = 5 (prime)\n3: 2(3) + 1 = 7 (prime)\n5: 2(5) + 1 = 11 (prime)\n7: 2(7) + 1 = 15 (not prime)\n11: 2(11) + 1 = 23 (prime)\n13: 2(13) + 1 = 27 (not prime)\n17: 2(17) + 1 = 35 (not prime)\n19: 2(19) + 1 = 39 (not prime)\n23: 2(23) + 1 = 47 (prime)\n29: 2(29) + 1 = 59 (prime)\n31: 2(31) + 1 = 63 (not prime)\n37: 2(37) + 1 = 75 (not prime)\n41: 2(41) + 1 = 83 (prime)\n43: 2(43) + 1 = 87 (not prime)\n47: 2(47) + 1 = 95 (not prime)\n53: 2(53) + 1 = 107 (prime, but greater than 100)\n59: 2(59) + 1 = 119 (not prime)\n61: 2(61) + 1 = 123 (not prime)\n67: 2(67) + 1 = 135 (not prime)\n71: 2(71) + 1 = 143 (not prime)\n73: 2(73) + 1 = 147 (not prime)\n79: 2(79) + 1 = 159 (not prime)\n83: 2(83) + 1 = 167 (prime, but greater than 100)\n89: 2(89) + 1 = 179 (prime, but greater than 100)\n97: 2(97) + 1 = 195 (not prime)\n\nThe Sophie Germain primes between 1 and 100 are:\n\n2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, and 41\n\nThere are 7 Sophie Germain primes between 1 and 100."
