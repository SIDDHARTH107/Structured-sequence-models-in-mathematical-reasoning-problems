    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to take the partial derivatives of the coefficients of $\\omega$ with respect to the local coordinates $(x, y)$ and then apply the antisymmetry property of the exterior product. \n\nRecall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form $\\omega = A dx + B dy$ is given by:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y}\\right) dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nIn our case, $\\omega = x dy - y dx$, so $A = -y$ and $B = x$. Now, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial (-y)}{\\partial y} = -1\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x} = 1\n$$\n\nPlugging these into the formula for $d\\omega$, we get:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = \\left(1 - (-1)\\right) dx \\wedge dy = 2 dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ on $M$ is $d\\omega = 2 dx \\wedge dy$."
