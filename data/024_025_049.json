    "message_2": "To determine the values of the Chern classes of the complex manifold X, we need to recall the definitions of the Chern numbers and Chern classes. The Chern numbers are the topological invariants of the complex manifold, and they are given by the integrals of the products of the Chern classes over the manifold.\n\nThe Chern classes are cohomology classes associated with complex vector bundles, and they are denoted by c_i, where i is the index of the Chern class. For a complex manifold of dimension n, there are n Chern classes, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n. The Chern numbers are given by the integrals of the products of the Chern classes over the manifold:\n\nc1(X) = ∫ c_1(X)\nc2(X) = ∫ c_1(X) * c_1(X) - 2 * c_2(X)\nc3(X) = ∫ c_1(X) * c_1(X) * c_1(X) - 3 * c_1(X) * c_2(X) + 3 * c_3(X)\n\nGiven the Chern numbers c1(X) = 2, c2(X) = 4, and c3(X) = 6, we can solve for the Chern classes:\n\n1. ∫ c_1(X) = 2\n2. ∫ c_1(X) * c_1(X) - 2 * c_2(X) = 4\n3. ∫ c_1(X) * c_1(X) * c_1(X) - 3 * c_1(X) * c_2(X) + 3 * c_3(X) = 6\n\nFrom equation (1), we have:\n\nc_1(X) = 2\n\nNow, substituting c_1(X) into equation (2):\n\n∫ (2) * (2) - 2 * c_2(X) = 4\n∫ 4 - 2 * c_2(X) = 4\n\nThus, we have:\n\nc_2(X) = 0\n\nFinally, substituting c_1(X) and c_2(X) into equation (3):\n\n∫ (2) * (2) * (2) - 3 * (2) * (0) + 3 * c_3(X) = 6\n∫ 8 + 3 * c_3(X) = 6\n\nHence, we get:\n\nc_3(X) = -2/3\n\nTherefore, the Chern classes of the complex manifold X are:\n\nc_1(X) = 2\nc_2(X) = 0\nc_3(X) = -2/3"
