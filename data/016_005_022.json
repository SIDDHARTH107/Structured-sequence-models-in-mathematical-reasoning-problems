    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. Let's denote the sum of the lengths of the removed line segments at the nth iteration as S(n).\n\nAt the first iteration (n = 1), we remove a line segment of length 1/3.\n\nAt the second iteration (n = 2), we remove two line segments, each of length 1/9 (1/3^2).\n\nAt the third iteration (n = 3), we remove four line segments, each of length 1/27 (1/3^3).\n\nIn general, at the nth iteration, we remove 2^(n-1) line segments, each of length 1/3^n.\n\nSo, the sum of the lengths of the removed line segments at the nth iteration, S(n), can be calculated as:\n\nS(n) = (1/3) + 2(1/9) + 4(1/27) + ... + 2^(n-1)(1/3^n)\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term a = 1/3, common ratio r = 2/3, and n terms. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\nS(n) = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nSubstituting the values for a and r, we get:\n\nS(n) = (1/3)(1 - (2/3)^n) / (1 - 2/3)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nS(n) = (1/3)(1 - (2/3)^n) / (1/3)\n\nS(n) = 1 - (2/3)^n\n\nSo, the sum of the lengths of all the line segments removed in the construction of the Cantor set up to the nth iteration is S(n) = 1 - (2/3)^n."
