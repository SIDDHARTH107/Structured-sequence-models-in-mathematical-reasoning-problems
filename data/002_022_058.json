    "message_1": "A torus has a minor radius of 5 cm and a major radius of 9 cm. What is the volume of the torus in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "The volume V of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In this case, R = 9 cm and r = 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 9 * 5^2\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 9 * 25\n\nV = 50 * π^2 * 9\n\nV ≈ 50 * (9.8696) * 9\n\nV ≈ 4451.65 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 4451.65 cubic centimeters."
