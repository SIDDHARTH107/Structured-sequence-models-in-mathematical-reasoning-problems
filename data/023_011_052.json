    "message_2": "The given music signal is already in the time domain as a sum of sinusoidal functions. We can directly read the frequency components and their respective amplitudes from the equation without needing to perform the Fourier transform.\n\nThe equation is: `s(t) = sin(2πf1 t) + 0.5 sin(2πf2 t) + 0.25 sin(2πf3 t)`, where `f1 = 100Hz`, `f2 = 300Hz`, and `f3 = 500Hz`.\n\nThe frequency components and their respective amplitudes are:\n\n1. Frequency component `f1 = 100Hz` with amplitude `A1 = 1` (since the coefficient of the first term is 1).\n2. Frequency component `f2 = 300Hz` with amplitude `A2 = 0.5` (since the coefficient of the second term is 0.5).\n3. Frequency component `f3 = 500Hz` with amplitude `A3 = 0.25` (since the coefficient of the third term is 0.25).\n\nSo, the frequency components are 100Hz, 300Hz, and 500Hz with respective amplitudes of 1, 0.5, and 0.25."
