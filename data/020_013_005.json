    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the semi-definite constraint as a matrix inequality:\n\n[[2, 1], [1, 2]] [[x1], [x2]] - 3I >= 0\n\nThis can be expanded to:\n\n[[2x1 + x2, x1 + 2x2]] - [[3, 0], [0, 3]] >= 0\n\nWhich results in:\n\n[[2x1 + x2 - 3, x1 + 2x2], [x1 + 2x2, 2x1 + x2 - 3]] >= 0\n\nFor a matrix to be positive semi-definite, all its principal minors must be non-negative. In this case, we have two principal minors:\n\n1. The determinant of the 1x1 matrix in the top-left corner: 2x1 + x2 - 3 >= 0\n2. The determinant of the entire 2x2 matrix: (2x1 + x2 - 3)^2 - (x1 + 2x2)^2 >= 0\n\nNow we have the following constraints:\n\n1. x1 + x2 <= 8\n2. x1 - x2 >= 2\n3. x1 >= 0\n4. x2 >= 0\n5. 2x1 + x2 - 3 >= 0\n6. (2x1 + x2 - 3)^2 - (x1 + 2x2)^2 >= 0\n\nWe can solve this problem graphically by plotting the feasible region and finding the optimal solution.\n\n1. x2 <= 8 - x1\n2. x2 <= x1 - 2\n3. x1 >= 0\n4. x2 >= 0\n5. x2 >= 3 - 2x1\n\nPlotting these constraints, we find that the feasible region is a pentagon with vertices at (0, 3), (1, 2), (4, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 0).\n\nNow we need to find the optimal solution within this feasible region. We can do this by evaluating the objective function 2x1 + x2 at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 3): 2(0) + 3 = 3\n2. (1, 2): 2(1) + 2 = 4\n3. (4, 4): 2(4) + 4 = 12\n4. (6, 2): 2(6) + 2 = 14\n5. (6, 0): 2(6) + 0 = 12\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 14, which occurs at the vertex (6, 2). Therefore, the optimal solution is x1 = 6 and x2 = 2, with an optimal value of 14."
