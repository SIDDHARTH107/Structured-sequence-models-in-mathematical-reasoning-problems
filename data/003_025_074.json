    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the east direction, we can use the components of the velocity vector. Since the boat is moving at an angle of 45 degrees north of the east direction, we can use trigonometry to find the components of the velocity in the east and north directions.\n\nLet V_east be the component of the velocity in the east direction and V_north be the component of the velocity in the north direction.\n\nV_east = V * cos(45)\nV_north = V * sin(45)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the velocity (5 m/s) and 45 degrees is the angle between the velocity vector and the east direction.\n\nUsing the given values:\n\nV_east = 5 * cos(45)\nV_north = 5 * sin(45)\n\nSince cos(45) = sin(45) = √2/2:\n\nV_east = 5 * (√2/2) = 5√2/2 ≈ 3.54 m/s\nV_north = 5 * (√2/2) = 5√2/2 ≈ 3.54 m/s\n\nThe magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the east direction is the component of the velocity in the east direction, which is approximately 3.54 m/s.\n\nThe direction of the boat's velocity relative to the east direction is given by the angle between the east direction and the velocity vector. Since the boat is moving at an angle of 45 degrees north of the east direction, the direction of the boat's velocity relative to the east direction is 45 degrees north."
