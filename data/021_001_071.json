    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its reduced row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 3  4 -2 | 10 |\n| 2 -1  3 | -1 |\n| 1  2  1 |  5 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 3 to get the 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1  2  1 |  5 |\n| 2 -1  3 | -1 |\n| 3  4 -2 | 10 |\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 2 * Row 1, and replace Row 3 with Row 3 - 3 * Row 1:\n\n| 1  2  1 |  5 |\n| 0 -5  1 | -11|\n| 0 -2 -5 | -5 |\n\nStep 3: Multiply Row 2 by -1/5 to get a 1 in the second row and second column:\n\n| 1  2  1 |  5  |\n| 0  1 -1/5| 11/5|\n| 0 -2 -5 | -5  |\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - 2 * Row 2, and replace Row 3 with Row 3 + 2 * Row 2:\n\n| 1  0  9/5 | -1/5 |\n| 0  1 -1/5 | 11/5 |\n| 0  0 -9  |  1   |\n\nStep 5: Multiply Row 3 by -1/9 to get a 1 in the third row and third column:\n\n| 1  0  9/5 | -1/5 |\n| 0  1 -1/5 | 11/5 |\n| 0  0  1   | -1/9 |\n\nStep 6: Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - (9/5) * Row 3, and replace Row 2 with Row 2 + (1/5) * Row 3:\n\n| 1  0  0 |  1/3 |\n| 0  1  0 |  2   |\n| 0  0  1 | -1/9 |\n\nNow the matrix is in its reduced row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly:\n\nx = 1/3\ny = 2\nz = -1/9"
