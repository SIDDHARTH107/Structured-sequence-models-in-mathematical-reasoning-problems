    "message_1": "A boat is sailing due north with a speed of 12 km/hr. If the water current flowing towards east is at a speed of 8 km/hr, find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity with respect to the ground.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity with respect to the ground, we need to consider both the boat's velocity in the north direction and the water current's velocity in the east direction.\n\nLet Vb represent the boat's velocity (12 km/hr due north) and Vc represent the water current's velocity (8 km/hr due east).\n\nWe can represent these velocities as vectors:\n\nVb = 12 km/hr (due north) = <0, 12>\nVc = 8 km/hr (due east) = <8, 0>\n\nTo find the boat's velocity with respect to the ground (Vg), we add the two vectors:\n\nVg = Vb + Vc = <0, 12> + <8, 0> = <8, 12>\n\nNow we have the boat's velocity with respect to the ground as a vector: <8, 12>. To find the magnitude of this vector, we use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n|Vg| = √(8^2 + 12^2) = √(64 + 144) = √208 ≈ 14.42 km/hr\n\nTo find the direction of the boat's velocity with respect to the ground, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(opposite/adjacent) = arctan(12/8) = arctan(1.5) ≈ 56.31°\n\nSince the boat is moving in the first quadrant (north and east), the direction is measured counterclockwise from the east direction:\n\nDirection = 90° - 56.31° ≈ 33.69° (north of east)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's velocity with respect to the ground is approximately 14.42 km/hr, and the direction is approximately 33.69° north of east."
