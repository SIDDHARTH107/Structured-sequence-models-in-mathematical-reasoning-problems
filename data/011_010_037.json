    "message_2": "Let's call the two certain books A and B. We will first count the total number of ways to arrange the other 4 books, and then insert A and B into the arrangement such that they are not adjacent.\n\nThere are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the other 4 books. Now, we need to insert A and B into the arrangement. There are 5 spaces between the 4 books and 2 spaces at the ends, giving us a total of 7 spaces to insert A and B. We can think of this as choosing 2 of the 7 spaces to insert A and B.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the cases where A and B are adjacent. To do this, we can treat A and B as a single unit (AB or BA), and now we have 5 \"units\" to arrange (the 4 other books and the AB/BA unit). There are 5! = 120 ways to arrange these 5 units. But since A and B can be in either order (AB or BA), we need to divide this by 2, giving us 60 arrangements where A and B are adjacent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of ways to insert A and B into the arrangement without them being adjacent:\n\nC(7, 2) - 60 = 21 - 60 = -39\n\nHowever, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of arrangements. This means that we have made an error in our calculations. Let's reevaluate our approach.\n\nInstead of using the Catalan numbers directly, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We will first count the total number of ways to arrange all 6 books, and then subtract the number of ways where A and B are adjacent.\n\nThere are 6! = 720 ways to arrange all 6 books. Now, we need to subtract the cases where A and B are adjacent, which we already calculated as 60.\n\nSo, the total number of unique ways to arrange the books such that no two certain books are adjacent is:\n\n720 - 60 = 660"
