    "message_2": "In a right triangle with a 30-degree angle, the other acute angle is 60 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees and one angle is a 90-degree right angle). This is a special type of right triangle called a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1 : √3 : 2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest side (1), the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the middle side (√3), and the hypotenuse is the longest side (2).\n\nNow we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for the 30-degree angle:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of 30 degrees:\nsin(30) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 1 / 2\n\n2. Cosine (cos) of 30 degrees:\ncos(30) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = √3 / 2\n\n3. Tangent (tan) of 30 degrees:\ntan(30) = opposite side / adjacent side = 1 / √3 = √3 / 3 (rationalized)\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios of the 30-degree angle are:\n\nsin(30) = 1/2\ncos(30) = √3/2\ntan(30) = √3/3"
