    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-similar fractal, which means it can be constructed by repeating a pattern at a smaller scale. In the case of the Vicsek fractal, the base shape is a square, and the construction process involves dividing the square into 9 smaller squares (3x3 grid) and keeping the center square and the four corner squares, removing the other four squares.\n\nTo find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal, N = 5 (the center square and the four corner squares), and the scaling factor s = 3 (since the square is divided into a 3x3 grid).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension D is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nThe exact Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when its base shape is a square with side length 1 is approximately 1.46497."
