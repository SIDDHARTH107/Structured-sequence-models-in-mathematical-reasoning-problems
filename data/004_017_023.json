    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx):\n\ny = 2x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2) * 2x^(1/2) = 3x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + (3x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + 9x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's set:\n\nu = 1 + 9x\ndu/dx = 9\ndx = du/9\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 37] sqrt(u) * (1/9) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (1/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 37]\n\nL = (2/27) * (37^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (2/27) * (37 * sqrt(37) - 1)\n\nL ≈ 24.412\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve is approximately 24.412 units."
