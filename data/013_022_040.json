    "message_1": "In the Dictator Game, there are two players, A and B. A is given $10 and is asked to divide it between themselves and B. A can choose to give any amount between $0 and $10 to B and keep the rest for themselves. If B accepts the offer, they both get to keep the money. If B rejects the offer, then neither of them gets any money. If B accepts the offer, what is the maximum amount of money A can keep for themselves while still ensuring that B accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the decision of whether to accept or reject the offer lies entirely with player B. Assuming that player B is rational and prefers to have some money rather than none, they would accept any offer greater than $0. Therefore, player A can maximize the amount they keep for themselves by giving the smallest possible positive amount to player B. In this case, A could give $0.01 to B and keep $9.99 for themselves. This ensures that B accepts the offer, as they still receive a positive amount of money."
