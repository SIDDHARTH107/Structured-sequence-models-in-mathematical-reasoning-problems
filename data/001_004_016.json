    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients, which is 4:\n\n4(x^2 + 3x - 4)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two binomials (ax + b)(cx + d) such that:\n\n1. a * c = 1 (the coefficient of x^2)\n2. b * d = -4 (the constant term)\n3. ad + bc = 3 (the coefficient of x)\n\nThe possible factor pairs of -4 are (-1, 4) and (1, -4). We can see that (1, -4) works, because:\n\n1 * -4 = -4\n1 * 1 + (-4) * 1 = 3\n\nSo, the factored form of the quadratic expression is (x + 1)(x - 4). Therefore, the factored form of the given polynomial is:\n\n4(x + 1)(x - 4)"
