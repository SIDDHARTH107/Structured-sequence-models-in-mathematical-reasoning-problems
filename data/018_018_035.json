    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets without their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection operations are commutative, we can rewrite this as:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nNow, let's find B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nWe can see that A Δ B = {1, 2, 5, 6} and B Δ A = {1, 2, 5, 6}. Therefore, the symmetric difference is commutative:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A"
