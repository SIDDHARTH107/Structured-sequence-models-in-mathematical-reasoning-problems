    "message_1": "In a trust game, player A receives $10 and can decide to pass any amount between $0 and $10 to player B. The amount given to player B is then tripled, and player B can choose to keep or return a portion of the tripled amount to player A. If player B decides to keep the tripled amount, what is the maximum amount of money that player A should give to player B to maximize their own earnings?",
    "message_2": "If player B decides to keep the entire tripled amount and not return any portion to player A, then player A should not give any money to player B in order to maximize their own earnings. In this case, player A should give $0 to player B, keeping the entire $10 for themselves."
