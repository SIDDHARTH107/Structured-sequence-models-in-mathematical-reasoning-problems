    "message_2": "First, we need to compute the gradient of the scalar functions $f$ and $g$. Let's start with $f(x,y,z) = x^2y$:\n\n$\\nabla f = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right) = (2xy, x^2, 0)$\n\nNow, let's compute the gradient of $g(x,y,z) = 2x+3y-z$:\n\n$\\nabla g = \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}\\right) = (2, 3, -1)$\n\nNow, we can compute the tensor field $T = f\\nabla g$:\n\n$T = f\\nabla g = (2xy(2), x^2(3), x^2(-1)) = (4xy, 3x^2, -x^2)$\n\nNow, we need to compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the covariant derivative is the same as the regular derivative. So, we need to compute the derivatives of each component of $T$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = (4y, 6x, -2x)$\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = (4x, 0, 0)$\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = (0, 0, 0)$\n\nNow, we can evaluate these derivatives at the point $(1,2,3)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}(1,2,3) = (8, 6, -2)$\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(1,2,3) = (4, 0, 0)$\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}(1,2,3) = (0, 0, 0)$\n\nFinally, we can write the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ at the point $(1,2,3)$ as a matrix:\n\n$\\nabla T(1,2,3) = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 6 & -2 \\\\ 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$"
