One common method is the Euler method, but it's not very accurate for this problem. A better choice is the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. Let's use a time step of Δt = 0.01 and iterate the system 100 times.\n\nHere's the 4th order Runge-Kutta method applied to the Lorenz equations:\n\n1. Initialize the variables:\nx = 1, y = 1, z = 20\nσ = 10, β = 8/3, ρ = 28\nΔt = 0.01\n\n2.

Note that the result is sensitive to the choice of the time step Δt and the number of iterations, so it may vary depending on these parameters."
