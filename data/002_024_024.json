    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and the lengths of its parallel sides are 12 cm and 18 cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter parallel side (12 cm) to the longer parallel side (18 cm). This line will be the height of both right triangles, which is 8 cm.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles with heights of 8 cm. The base of one triangle is the difference between the lengths of the parallel sides, which is (18 - 12) cm = 6 cm. The base of the other triangle is the length of the shorter parallel side, which is 12 cm.\n\nLet's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of a and b:\n\na^2 = 8^2 + 6^2\na^2 = 64 + 36\na^2 = 100\na = √100\na = 10 cm\n\nb^2 = 8^2 + 12^2\nb^2 = 64 + 144\nb^2 = 208\nb = √208\nb ≈ 14.42 cm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all four sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 18 cm + 10 cm + 14.42 cm ≈ 54.42 cm (rounded to two decimal places)"
