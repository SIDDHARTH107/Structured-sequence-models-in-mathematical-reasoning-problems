It costs $3 to produce a unit of A and $6 to produce a unit of B. The selling price of A is $8 and B is $12. What is the optimal production combination of A and B to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production combination of A and B to maximize profit, we need to first determine the profit per unit for each product. \n\nProfit per unit of A = Selling price of A - Cost to produce A\nProfit per unit of A = $8 - $3 = $5\n\nProfit per unit of B = Selling price of B - Cost to produce B\nProfit per unit of B = $12 - $6 = $6\n\nNow, let's assume that the company uses x units of material X for product A and y units of material Y for product B. We need to find the optimal values of x and y to maximize profit.\n\nSince the company has 1000 units of material X and 1500 units of material Y, we have the following constraints:\n\nx ≤ 1000\ny ≤ 1500\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nTotal Profit = 5x + 6y\n\nTo find the optimal production combination, we can use linear programming techniques. However, in this case, we can also use a more straightforward approach by analyzing the profit per unit of each product.\n\nSince the profit per unit of B ($6) is greater than the profit per unit of A ($5), the company should prioritize producing product B to maximize profit. Therefore, the company should use all available units of material Y to produce product B.\n\ny = 1500\n\nNow, the company can use the remaining units of material X to produce product A.\n\nx = 1000\n\nSo, the optimal production combination to maximize profit is to produce 1000 units of product A and 1500 units of product B."
