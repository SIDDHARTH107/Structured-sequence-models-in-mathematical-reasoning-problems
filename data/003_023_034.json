    "message_1": "A question for a math student to solve regarding finding the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry could be:\n\nGiven two vectors A = [3, 5, -2] and B = [2,-1,4], find the cross product A x B using the trigonometric formula.",
    "message_2": "To find the cross product A x B using the trigonometric formula, we first need to find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, the angle between them, and the unit normal vector.\n\n1. Magnitude of A and B:\n‖A‖ = √(3² + 5² + (-2)²) = √(9 + 25 + 4) = √38\n‖B‖ = √(2² + (-1)² + 4²) = √(4 + 1 + 16) = √21\n\n2. Angle between A and B:\nTo find the angle between A and B, we first find the dot product of A and B, and then use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (‖A‖‖B‖)\n\nA · B = (3 * 2) + (5 * -1) + (-2 * 4) = 6 - 5 - 8 = -7\n\ncos(θ) = (-7) / (√38 * √21) = -7 / (√798)\n\nNow, find the angle θ:\nθ = arccos(-7 / √798)\n\n3. Unit normal vector:\nTo find the unit normal vector, we can use the cross product formula:\n\nA x B = ‖A‖‖B‖sin(θ)N\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector.\n\nFirst, we need to find the sine of the angle θ:\nsin(θ) = √(1 - cos²(θ)) = √(1 - (-7/√798)²) = √(1 - 49/798) = √(749/798)\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = (√38 * √21 * √(749/798))N = (√(38 * 21 * 749/798))N = (√(59259/798))N\n\nSince we are asked to find the cross product A x B, we need to find the components of the vector A x B, not just its magnitude. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = (AyBz - AzBy, AzBx - AxBz, AxBy - AyBx)\n\nA x B = (5 * 4 - (-2) * (-1), (-2) * 2 - 3 * 4, 3 * (-1) - 5 * 2) = (20 - 2, -4 - 12, -3 - 10) = (18, -16, -13)\n\nSo, the cross product A x B = [18, -16, -13]."
