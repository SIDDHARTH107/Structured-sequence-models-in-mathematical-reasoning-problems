    "message_2": "Let's use the notation (a, b, c) to represent the number of 1-point, 2-point, and 4-point moves, respectively. We need to find all combinations of (a, b, c) such that a + 2b + 4c = 10 and a + b + c = 5.\n\n1. (4, 1, 0): Four 1-point moves and one 2-point move. This gives a total of 4 + 2 = 6 points.\n2. (3, 2, 0): Three 1-point moves and two 2-point moves. This gives a total of 3 + 4 = 7 points.\n3. (2, 3, 0): Two 1-point moves and three 2-point moves. This gives a total of 2 + 6 = 8 points.\n4. (1, 4, 0): One 1-point move and four 2-point moves. This gives a total of 1 + 8 = 9 points.\n5. (0, 5, 0): Five 2-point moves. This gives a total of 10 points.\n6. (2, 0, 2): Two 1-point moves and two 4-point moves. This gives a total of 2 + 8 = 10 points.\n7. (1, 1, 1): One 1-point move, one 2-point move, and one 4-point move. This gives a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 points.\n8. (0, 2, 1): Two 2-point moves and one 4-point move. This gives a total of 4 + 4 = 8 points.\n9. (0, 0, 2): Two 4-point moves. This gives a total of 8 points.\n\nOut of these 9 possibilities, only two of them result in a total of 10 points: (0, 5, 0) and (2, 0, 2). Therefore, there are 2 ways to score a total of 10 points after 5 moves."
