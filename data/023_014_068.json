Using the Fourier transform, verify that the probability is equal to the square of the coefficient of the k = π/L term in the Fourier series expansion of ψ(x).",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the particle is located between x = L/4 and x = L/2, we need to calculate the integral of the square of the wave function (|ψ(x)|^2) over this interval:\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = ∫[L/4, L/2] |ψ(x)|^2 dx\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the wave function by finding the normalization constant A. We do this by setting the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 over the entire domain equal to 1:\n\n1 = ∫[0, L] |ψ(x)|^2 dx = ∫[0, L] A^2 sin^2(πx/L) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the identity sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2:\n\n1 = A^2 ∫[0, L] (1 - cos(2πx/L))/2 dx\n\n1 = A^2 [x/2 - (L/4π)sin(2πx/L)] [0, L]\n\n1 = A^2 (L/2)\n\nA = sqrt(2/L)\n\nNow we can substitute A back into the wave function:\n\nψ(x) = sqrt(2/L) sin(πx/L)\n\nNext, we calculate the probability:\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = ∫[L/4, L/2] (2/L) sin^2(πx/L) dx\n\nUsing the same identity as before:\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = (2/L) ∫[L/4, L/2] (1 - cos(2πx/L))/2 dx\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = (1/L) [x/2 - (L/4π)sin(2πx/L)] [L/4, L/2]\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = (1/L) [(L/4) - (L/8π)(sin(π) - sin(π/2))]\n\nSince sin(π) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1:\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = (1/L) [(L/4) - (L/8π)(0 - 1)]\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = (1/L) (L/4 - L/8π)\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = 1/4 - 1/8π ≈ 0.1464\n\nNow, we will verify this result using the Fourier series expansion of ψ(x). The Fourier series of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n cos(nπx/L) + b_n sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients:\n\na_n = (2/L) ∫[0, L] f(x) cos(nπx/L) dx\n\nb_n = (2/L) ∫[0, L] f(x) sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFor our wave function ψ(x), we have:\n\nψ(x) = Σ b_n sin(nπx/L)\n\nSince ψ(x) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients. We already know that ψ(x) = sqrt(2/L) sin(πx/L), so we can compare this to the Fourier series expansion:\n\nψ(x) = Σ b_n sin(nπx/L) = sqrt(2/L) sin(πx/L)\n\nThis implies that b_1 = sqrt(2/L) and all other b_n coefficients are zero. Now, we can calculate the probability using the square of the b_1 coefficient:\n\nP(x = L/4 to L/2) = |b_1|^2 = (2/L)\n\nThis result is the same as the one obtained from the integral of the wave function, confirming that the probability is equal to the square of the coefficient of the k = π/L term in the Fourier series expansion of ψ(x)."
