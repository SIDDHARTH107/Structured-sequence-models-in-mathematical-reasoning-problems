    "message_2": "To find the 7th term in the expansion of (x + y)^10, we will use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any natural number n and real numbers x and y, the expansion of (x + y)^n is given by:\n\n(x + y)^n = C(n, 0) * x^n * y^0 + C(n, 1) * x^(n-1) * y^1 + ... + C(n, n) * x^0 * y^n\n\nwhere C(n, r) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 10, and we want to find the 7th term, which corresponds to r = 6 (since we start counting from the 0th term).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the binomial coefficient C(10, 6):\n\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6! * (10 - 6)!)\n\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6! * 4!)\n\nC(10, 6) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(10, 6) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(10, 6) = 210\n\nNow, let's find the 7th term in the expansion:\n\n7th term = C(10, 6) * x^(10-6) * y^6\n\n7th term = 210 * x^4 * y^6\n\nSo, the 7th term in the expansion of (x + y)^10 is 210x^4y^6."
