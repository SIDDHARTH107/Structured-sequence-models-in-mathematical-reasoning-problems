    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 over the field F11, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible x and y values in the field F11 and checking if they satisfy the equation. If they do, we count them as a point on the curve.\n\nHere's the process:\n\n1. Initialize a counter for the number of points on the curve, set it to 1 to account for the point at infinity.\n2. Iterate through all x values in the field F11 (0 to 10).\n3. For each x value, calculate the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 + 5x + 7) modulo 11.\n4. Check if there's a y value in the field F11 such that y^2 is congruent to the calculated right-hand side modulo 11. If there is, increment the counter by 2 (since there are two possible y values for each x value).\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n- For x = 0: RHS = (0^3 + 5*0 + 7) % 11 = 7. There's no y such that y^2 % 11 = 7.\n- For x = 1: RHS = (1^3 + 5*1 + 7) % 11 = 1. y = 1 and y = 10 satisfy the equation, so increment the counter by 2.\n- For x = 2: RHS = (2^3 + 5*2 + 7) % 11 = 6. y = 4 and y = 7 satisfy the equation, so increment the counter by 2.\n- For x = 3: RHS = (3^3 + 5*3 + 7) % 11 = 9. y = 5 and y = 6 satisfy the equation, so increment the counter by 2.\n- For x = 4: RHS = (4^3 + 5*4 + 7) % 11 = 4. y = 2 and y = 9 satisfy the equation, so increment the counter by 2.\n- For x = 5: RHS = (5^3 + 5*5 + 7) % 11 = 3. There's no y such that y^2 % 11 = 3.\n- For x = 6: RHS = (6^3 + 5*6 + 7) % 11 = 8. There's no y such that y^2 % 11 = 8.\n- For x = 7: RHS = (7^3 + 5*7 + 7) % 11 = 0. y = 0 satisfies the equation, so increment the counter by 1 (since there's only one y value for x = 7).\n- For x = 8: RHS = (8^3 + 5*8 + 7) % 11 = 10. There's no y such that y^2 % 11 = 10.\n- For x = 9: RHS = (9^3 + 5*9 + 7) % 11 = 5. y = 3 and y = 8 satisfy the equation, so increment the counter by 2.\n- For x = 10: RHS = (10^3 + 5*10 + 7) % 11 = 2. There's no y such that y^2 % 11 = 2.\n\nAfter iterating through all x values, the counter is at 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12.\n\nSo, the order of the elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 over the field F11 is 12."
