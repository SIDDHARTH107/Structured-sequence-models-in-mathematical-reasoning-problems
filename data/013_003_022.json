    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A is given $100 and must offer a split between himself and Player B. Player B can either accept the split or reject it, in which case neither player gets any money. What is the optimal offer for Player A to make if he wants to maximize his chances of Player B accepting the split?",
    "message_2": "The optimal offer for Player A to make in an Ultimatum Game depends on the assumptions made about the rationality and preferences of Player B. If we assume that both players are perfectly rational and only care about maximizing their own monetary gain, then Player A should offer the smallest possible amount greater than $0 to Player B (e.g., $1). This is because a rational Player B would accept any offer greater than $0, as it is better than getting nothing.\n\nHowever, in reality, people often exhibit fairness concerns and may reject offers that they perceive as unfair, even if it means getting nothing. In this case, the optimal offer for Player A would be to split the money more fairly, such as offering $50 to Player B. This would maximize the chances of Player B accepting the split, as they would perceive it as fair.\n\nIn experimental studies of the Ultimatum Game, the average offer made by Player A is typically around 40-50% of the total amount, and offers below 20-30% are often rejected by Player B. Therefore, to maximize the chances of acceptance, Player A should offer around 40-50% of the total amount to Player B."
