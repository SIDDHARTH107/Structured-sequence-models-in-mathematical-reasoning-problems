    "message_1": "Sure, here is a potential problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose we have a semi-definite program with the following objective function and constraints: \n\nMaximize: $3x_1 + 2x_2$\n\nSubject to:\n\n$x_1 + x_2 \\leq 3$\n\n$x_1 - x_2 \\geq 1$\n\n$x_1, x_2 \\geq 0$\n\nUsing a semi-definite programming solver, determine the optimal values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ that maximize the objective function while satisfying the given constraints.",
    "message_2": "This problem is actually a linear programming problem, not a semi-definite programming problem. To solve it, we can use the graphical method or the simplex method. Here, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the constraints as equalities and plot them on a coordinate plane:\n\n1. $x_1 + x_2 = 3$\n2. $x_1 - x_2 = 1$\n3. $x_1 = 0$\n4. $x_2 = 0$\n\nNow, we can find the intersection points of these lines:\n\n1. Intersection of lines 1 and 2: $(2, 1)$\n2. Intersection of lines 1 and 3: $(0, 3)$\n3. Intersection of lines 1 and 4: $(3, 0)$\n4. Intersection of lines 2 and 3: $(1, -1)$ (not valid, as $x_2 \\geq 0$)\n5. Intersection of lines 2 and 4: $(1, 0)$\n\nNow, we have the feasible region defined by the intersection points $(0, 3)$, $(3, 0)$, $(2, 1)$, and $(1, 0)$. We will evaluate the objective function at each of these points:\n\n1. $3(0) + 2(3) = 6$\n2. $3(3) + 2(0) = 9$\n3. $3(2) + 2(1) = 8$\n4. $3(1) + 2(0) = 3$\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is $9$, which occurs at the point $(3, 0)$. Therefore, the optimal values for $x_1$ and $x_2$ are $x_1 = 3$ and $x_2 = 0$."
