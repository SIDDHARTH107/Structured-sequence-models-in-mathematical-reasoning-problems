    "message_2": "Let A be the number of employees who know Java, B be the number of employees who know C++, and C be the number of employees who know both languages. We are given:\n\nA = 35\nB = 25\nC = 15\n\nWe want to find the number of employees who do not know either language. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal employees = employees who know Java + employees who know C++ - employees who know both languages + employees who know neither language\n\nLet X be the number of employees who know neither language. We have:\n\n60 = 35 + 25 - 15 + X\n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\n60 = 45 + X\nX = 60 - 45\nX = 15\n\nSo, 15 employees do not know either Java nor C++."
