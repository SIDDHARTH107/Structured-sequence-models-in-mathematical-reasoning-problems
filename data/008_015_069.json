    "message_2": "First, we need to rewrite the system of linear equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  5  2 -1 |\n    |  2  8  1 |\n    | -1  0  1 |\n\nb = | 3 |\n    | 8 |\n    | 2 |\n\nNow, we need to perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition is only applicable to symmetric and positive-definite matrices. Our matrix A is symmetric, but it is not positive-definite. Therefore, we cannot use Cholesky decomposition to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or Cramer's rule to solve this system. Here, we will use Gaussian elimination.\n\n1. Add the first row multiplied by 1/5 to the second row:\n\nR2 = R2 - (1/5) * R1\n\nNew matrix A:\n\n|  5  2 -1 |\n|  0  7.6 1.2 |\n| -1  0  1 |\n\n2. Add the first row multiplied by 1/5 to the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 + (1/5) * R1\n\nNew matrix A:\n\n|  5  2 -1 |\n|  0  7.6 1.2 |\n|  0  0.4 0.8 |\n\n3. Divide the third row by 0.4:\n\nR3 = R3 / 0.4\n\nNew matrix A:\n\n|  5  2 -1 |\n|  0  7.6 1.2 |\n|  0  1  2 |\n\n4. Subtract the third row multiplied by 1.2 from the second row:\n\nR2 = R2 - 1.2 * R3\n\nNew matrix A:\n\n|  5  2 -1 |\n|  0  7.6 0 |\n|  0  1  2 |\n\n5. Divide the second row by 7.6:\n\nR2 = R2 / 7.6\n\nNew matrix A:\n\n|  5  2 -1 |\n|  0  1  0 |\n|  0  1  2 |\n\n6. Subtract the second row from the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 - R2\n\nNew matrix A:\n\n|  5  2 -1 |\n|  0  1  0 |\n|  0  0  2 |\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = 1 (from the third row)\ny = 8 - z = 8 - 1 = 7 (from the second row)\nx = (3 + z - 2y) / 5 = (3 + 1 - 14) / 5 = -2 (from the first row)\n\nSo, the solution is x = -2, y = 7, and z = 1."
