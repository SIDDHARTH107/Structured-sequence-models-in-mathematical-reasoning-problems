    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle ABC, AB = AC = 6 cm. The altitude from vertex A to side BC is 4 cm. What is the length of side BC?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the point where the altitude intersects side BC as D. Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude also bisects side BC, dividing it into two equal segments BD and DC. Let's denote the length of each segment as x. So, BD = DC = x.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles ABD and ADC with AD as the altitude. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for x.\n\nIn triangle ABD, we have:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n6^2 = 4^2 + x^2\n36 = 16 + x^2\nx^2 = 20\nx = √20\n\nSince BD = DC, the length of side BC is:\n\nBC = BD + DC = √20 + √20 = 2√20\n\nSo, the length of side BC is 2√20 cm."
