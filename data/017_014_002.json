    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5^1.\n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. By Sylow's first theorem, there must be at least one Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide the order of the group (20) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibilities are 1 and 5. If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By Sylow's first theorem, there must be at least one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide the order of the group (20) and be congruent to 1 mod 4. The only possibilities are 1 and 5. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal.\n\nNow we have four cases to consider:\n\n1. There is one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 2-subgroup. In this case, both subgroups are normal, and the group is the direct product of the two subgroups. There is only one group of order 5 (up to isomorphism), which is cyclic, and there are two groups of order 4 (up to isomorphism), which are cyclic and the Klein four-group. This gives us two isomorphism classes in this case: C_5 x C_4 and C_5 x V_4, where C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n and V_4 denotes the Klein four-group.\n\n2. There is one Sylow 5-subgroup and five Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal, but the Sylow 2-subgroups are not. The group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 5-subgroup and one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since there are two groups of order 4, we have two possible semidirect products for each Sylow 2-subgroup. However, one of these semidirect products is the direct product from case 1, so we have one new isomorphism class in this case.\n\n3. There are five Sylow 5-subgroups and one Sylow 2-subgroup. This case is symmetric to case 2, so we have one new isomorphism class in this case.\n\n4. There are five Sylow 5-subgroups and five Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, neither the Sylow 5-subgroups nor the Sylow 2-subgroups are normal. However, there are no new isomorphism classes in this case, as the groups formed in this case are isomorphic to the groups in cases 2 and 3.\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20."
