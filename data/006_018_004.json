    "message_1": "Consider a company with 100 employees. The probability of an employee committing financial fraud is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 5 employees in the company will commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 employees commit financial fraud, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that fewer than 5 employees commit financial fraud. Then, we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least 5 employees commit financial fraud.\n\nLet X be the number of employees who commit financial fraud. We can model this situation using the binomial distribution, where n = 100 (number of employees) and p = 0.05 (probability of an employee committing financial fraud).\n\nThe probability of fewer than 5 employees committing financial fraud is the sum of probabilities from X = 0 to X = 4:\n\nP(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate these probabilities:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0) ≈ 0.00592\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1) ≈ 0.03116\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2) ≈ 0.08118\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3) ≈ 0.13956\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * 0.05^4 * (1-0.05)^(100-4) ≈ 0.17837\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X < 5) = 0.00592 + 0.03116 + 0.08118 + 0.13956 + 0.17837 ≈ 0.43619\n\nFinally, find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - 0.43619 ≈ 0.56381\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 employees in the company will commit financial fraud is approximately 0.56381 or 56.381%."
