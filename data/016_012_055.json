The curve of order 0 is simply a line segment.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the Peano curve of order 3, we need to first understand how the length changes with each order.\n\nLet L(n) be the length of the Peano curve of order n. For order 0, L(0) is simply a line segment, so L(0) = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the transformation from order n-1 to order n. Each line segment in the curve of order n-1 is divided into three segments, and the middle segment is replaced with two sides of an equilateral triangle. The length of each of these two sides is equal to the length of the middle segment, which is 1/3 of the original segment length.\n\nSo, for each line segment in the curve of order n-1, we replace it with 4 segments, each of length 1/3 of the original segment. This means that the length of the curve of order n is 4/3 times the length of the curve of order n-1:\n\nL(n) = (4/3) * L(n-1)\n\nNow, we can find the length of the Peano curve of order 3 by applying this formula iteratively:\n\nL(1) = (4/3) * L(0) = (4/3) * 1 = 4/3\nL(2) = (4/3) * L(1) = (4/3) * (4/3) = 16/9\nL(3) = (4/3) * L(2) = (4/3) * (16/9) = 64/27\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve of order 3 is 64/27."
