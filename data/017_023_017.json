    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to one of these groups, we can first analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 72, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2. \n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3^2 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 2^3 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIf both n_2 and n_3 are 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, both of which are normal. In this case, G is the direct product of these two normal subgroups, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C72.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9. The group G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2 in this case, as A4 × C3 × C2 has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has nine Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. The group G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2 in this case, as A4 × C3 × C2 has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has nine Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9. The group G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2 in this case, as A4 × C3 × C2 has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the group G, we cannot determine a specific isomorphism. However, we have shown that G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C72 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, but not to the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2."
