    "message_1": "In a chemical plant, the probability of a worker being injured on any given day is 0.003. If the plant operates for 300 days in a year, what is the probability that at least one worker will be injured during the year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one worker will be injured during the year, we can first find the probability that no worker will be injured during the year and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a worker not being injured on any given day is 1 - 0.003 = 0.997.\n\nFor no worker to be injured during the entire year, this has to happen for all 300 days. So, the probability of no worker being injured during the year is (0.997)^300 ≈ 0.049.\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one worker will be injured during the year, we subtract the probability of no worker being injured from 1:\n\n1 - 0.049 ≈ 0.951.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one worker will be injured during the year is approximately 0.951 or 95.1%."
