    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation 5x + 11y = 77, we can first find one particular solution and then use the general form of the solutions to find all of them.\n\nStep 1: Find one particular solution\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution. Since gcd(5, 11) = 1, there exists integers x and y such that 5x + 11y = 1. Multiplying both sides by 77, we get 5(77x) + 11(77y) = 77.\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for 5 and 11:\n11 = 2 * 5 + 1\n1 = 11 - 2 * 5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 77:\n77 = 77 * 11 - 2 * 77 * 5\n\nSo, one particular solution is x = -154 and y = 77.\n\nStep 2: Find the general form of the solutions\nThe general form of the solutions to the Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a and b are coprime, is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, d = gcd(a, b), and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 5, b = 11, d = 1, x0 = -154, and y0 = 77. So the general form of the solutions is:\n\nx = -154 + 11n\ny = 77 - 5n\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for n."
