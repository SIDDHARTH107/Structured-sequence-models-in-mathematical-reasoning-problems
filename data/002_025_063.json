    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of each of the two congruent sides is 8 cm and the length of the base is 12 cm. Determine the length of a line segment drawn from the vertex to the midpoint of the base.",
    "message_2": "Let's call the isosceles triangle ABC, where A is the vertex between the two congruent sides, and B and C are the endpoints of the base. Let M be the midpoint of the base BC. We want to find the length of the line segment AM.\n\nSince M is the midpoint of BC, BM = MC = 12 cm / 2 = 6 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle ABM to find the length of AM. In triangle ABM, AB = 8 cm and BM = 6 cm.\n\nAM^2 = AB^2 - BM^2\nAM^2 = 8^2 - 6^2\nAM^2 = 64 - 36\nAM^2 = 28\nAM = √28\nAM ≈ 5.29 cm\n\nSo, the length of the line segment drawn from the vertex A to the midpoint M of the base is approximately 5.29 cm."
