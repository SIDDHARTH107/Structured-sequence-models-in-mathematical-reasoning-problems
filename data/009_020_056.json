    "message_2": "To find the control law $u(t)$ that minimizes the cost function $J(u)$, we can use the method of optimal control. We will employ the Hamiltonian approach to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's define the Hamiltonian $H$ as follows:\n\n$$\nH(x, u, p) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + u^2) + p(-2x + u)\n$$\n\nwhere $p$ is the costate variable. The necessary conditions for optimality are given by the following equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 0$\n2. $\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$\n3. $p(T) = 0$\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivative of $H$ with respect to $u$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = u + p\n$$\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we get the optimal control law:\n\n$$\nu^*(t) = -p(t)\n$$\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivative of $H$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = x - 2p\n$$\n\nUsing the second necessary condition, we get the costate equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = -x + 2p\n$$\n\nNow, we have two differential equations for $x$ and $p$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} &= -2x - p \\\\\n\\frac{dp}{dt} &= -x + 2p\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $y(0) = 0$. Since we want $y(t) = 0$ for all $t \\geq 0$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = 3x - 5y = 0\n$$\n\nwhich implies $x(t) = \\frac{5}{3}y(t) = 0$. Therefore, $x(t) = 0$ for all $t \\geq 0$. Using this information, we can solve the differential equations for $x$ and $p$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dp}{dt} &= 2p\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(t) &= 1 \\\\\np(t) &= p(0)e^{2t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $x(t) = 0$ for all $t \\geq 0$, we must have $p(0) = -1$. Thus, the optimal control law is:\n\n$$\nu^*(t) = -p(t) = e^{-2t}\n$$\n\nThis control law minimizes the cost function $J(u)$ while ensuring that $y(t) = 0$ for all $t \\geq 0$."
