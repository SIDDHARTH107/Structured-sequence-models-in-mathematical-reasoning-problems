    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, Ampere's law is represented as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field (B) is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop of radius r (5 cm in this case) centered on the wire as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field is tangent to the loop at every point, so the dot product B • dl simplifies to B * dl.\n\nNow, let's rewrite Ampere's law for this specific case:\n\n∮ B * dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮ dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nThe closed line integral of dl around the circular loop is equal to the circumference of the loop (2 * π * r):\n\nB * (2 * π * r) = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2 * π * r)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. The current enclosed by the loop is the same as the current in the wire (2 A). The distance r from the center of the wire is 5 cm, which is equal to 0.05 m. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.1π m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out:\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / (0.1)\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the wire is 8 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
