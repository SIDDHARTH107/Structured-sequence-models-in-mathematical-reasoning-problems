    "message_1": "What is the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 8 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(5)²(8)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(25)(8)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(200)\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(200)\n\nVolume ≈ 104.71976 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 104.72 cm³."
