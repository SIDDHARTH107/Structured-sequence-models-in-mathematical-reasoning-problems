    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 6 cm. Find the volume of the cone.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 6 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(6)^2(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(36)(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(360)\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(360)\n\nVolume ≈ 376.99112 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 376.99 cubic centimeters."
