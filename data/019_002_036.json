    "message_2": "The statement (∃x)S(x) ∧ (∀x)¬P(x) in English means \"There exists a number x such that x is a square number, and for all numbers x, x is not a prime number.\"\n\nNow, let's find the integer value of x that makes the statement (∀y)(S(y) → y>x) true. This statement means \"For all square numbers y, y is greater than x.\"\n\nThe smallest square number is 1 (1^2 = 1). If we choose x = 0, then all square numbers y will be greater than x, since all square numbers are positive. Therefore, the integer value of x that makes the statement true is x = 0."
