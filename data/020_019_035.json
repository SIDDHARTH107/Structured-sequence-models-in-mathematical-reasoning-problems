    "message_2": "To find the optimal control function for the rocket engine, we need to set up the equations of motion for the rocket and then apply the calculus of variations to find the optimal control function that maximizes the rocket's altitude.\n\nLet h(t) be the altitude of the rocket at time t, v(t) be its velocity, and m(t) be its mass (including fuel). The mass of the rocket decreases as fuel is consumed, so m(t) = 500 + (1000 - 100t) for 0 <= t <= 10 seconds, and m(t) = 500 for t > 10 seconds.\n\nThe equation of motion for the rocket is given by Newton's second law:\n\nm(t) * a(t) = T(t) - m(t) * g - k * v(t)^2,\n\nwhere a(t) is the acceleration of the rocket, T(t) is the thrust provided by the engine, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and k is the air resistance constant (0.2 kg/m).\n\nThe thrust T(t) is given by the engine's constant thrust of 15,000 N when the engine is on, and 0 when the engine is off. We want to find the optimal control function u(t) such that T(t) = u(t) * 15,000 N, where 0 <= u(t) <= 1.\n\nUsing the calculus of variations, we can set up the following functional to be maximized:\n\nJ[u(t)] = ∫[h(t) - λ(t) * (T(t) - m(t) * g - k * v(t)^2)] dt,\n\nwhere λ(t) is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional is:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂u') - ∂L/∂u = 0,\n\nwhere L is the integrand of the functional J[u(t)].\n\nSolving the Euler-Lagrange equation for u(t) and applying the boundary conditions, we find the optimal control function:\n\nu(t) = (m(t) * g + k * v(t)^2) / 15,000.\n\nTo find the maximum altitude reached by the rocket, we need to integrate the equations of motion with this optimal control function. This is a complex task that typically requires numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the system of differential equations.\n\nBy solving the system of differential equations numerically, we can find the maximum altitude reached by the rocket. The exact value will depend on the numerical method used and the accuracy of the calculations."
