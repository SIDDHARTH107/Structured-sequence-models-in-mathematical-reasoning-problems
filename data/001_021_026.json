    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 10x^2 + 7x - 2 = 0, we can try to factor it or use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or synthetic division. In this case, let's try factoring.\n\nFirst, we can try finding a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, -2) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 3). \n\nThe factors of -2 are ±1, ±2, and the factors of 3 are ±1, ±3. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±1/3, and ±2/3.\n\nNow, let's test these possible rational roots:\n\n1. f(1) = 3(1)^3 - 10(1)^2 + 7(1) - 2 = -2 ≠ 0\n2. f(-1) = 3(-1)^3 - 10(-1)^2 + 7(-1) - 2 = -12 ≠ 0\n3. f(2) = 3(2)^3 - 10(2)^2 + 7(2) - 2 = 0\n\nWe found a rational root: x = 2. Now, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n  _________________________\n2 |  3   -10    7    -2\n      0    6   -4     6\n  _________________________\n      3    -4    3     4\n```\n\nSo, the remaining quadratic factor is 3x^2 - 4x + 4. Now, we can use the quadratic formula to find the remaining roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(3)(4))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 48)) / 6\n\nx = (4 ± √(-32)) / 6\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the remaining roots are complex:\n\nx = (4 ± 4i√2) / 6\n\nx = 2/3 ± (2/3)i√2\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 10x^2 + 7x - 2 = 0 are x = 2, x = 2/3 + (2/3)i√2, and x = 2/3 - (2/3)i√2."
