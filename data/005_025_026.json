    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs claims that their bulbs have an average lifespan of 1200 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. A sample of 36 light bulbs has an average lifespan of 1180 hours. Test the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 0.05. Is there sufficient evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample z-test. \n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 1200 (The average lifespan of the light bulbs is 1200 hours)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 1200 (The average lifespan of the light bulbs is not 1200 hours)\n\nStep 2: Determine the significance level (α).\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic (z-score).\nz = (sample mean - population mean) / (population standard deviation / √sample size)\nz = (1180 - 1200) / (100 / √36)\nz = -20 / (100 / 6)\nz = -20 / 16.67\nz ≈ -1.20\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value(s) and make a decision.\nSince this is a two-tailed test, we will find the critical values for both tails. Using a z-table or calculator, we find the critical values for a 0.05 significance level to be approximately ±1.96.\n\nOur calculated z-score is -1.20, which falls between the critical values of -1.96 and 1.96. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is not sufficient evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim that their light bulbs have an average lifespan of 1200 hours at a 0.05 significance level."
