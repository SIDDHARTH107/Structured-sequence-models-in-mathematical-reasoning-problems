    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution $u(x,t)$ can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$. That is, $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. \n\nSubstituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (XT)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 (XT)}{\\partial x^2} - x^2XT$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $XT$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{X}\\frac{\\partial^2 X}{\\partial x^2} - x^2$\n\nNotice that the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$. Since these variables are independent, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda$\n\n$\\frac{1}{X}\\frac{\\partial^2 X}{\\partial x^2} - x^2 = -\\lambda$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n(1) $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda T$\n\n(2) $\\frac{\\partial^2 X}{\\partial x^2} - x^2X = -\\lambda X$\n\nSolving (1) is straightforward:\n\n$T(t) = Ce^{-\\lambda t}$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nTo solve (2), we first apply the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$:\n\n$X(0)T(t) = 0 \\Rightarrow X(0) = 0$\n\n$X(\\pi)T(t) = 0 \\Rightarrow X(\\pi) = 0$\n\nNow, we can solve (2) using the method of eigenfunctions. We assume that the eigenfunctions are of the form $X(x) = \\sin(kx)$, where $k$ is a constant. This satisfies the boundary conditions since $\\sin(0) = 0$ and $\\sin(k\\pi) = 0$ for integer values of $k$. Taking the second derivative of $X(x)$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 X}{\\partial x^2} = -k^2\\sin(kx)$\n\nSubstituting this into (2):\n\n$-k^2\\sin(kx) - x^2\\sin(kx) = -\\lambda \\sin(kx)$\n\nDividing by $\\sin(kx)$, we get:\n\n$-k^2 - x^2 = -\\lambda$\n\nNow, we can find the eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ and eigenfunctions $X_k(x)$:\n\n$\\lambda_k = k^2$\n\n$X_k(x) = \\sin(kx)$\n\nThe general solution to the PDE is a linear combination of the eigenfunctions:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_k \\sin(kx)e^{-k^2t}$\n\nTo find the coefficients $a_k$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = e^{-x^2}$:\n\n$e^{-x^2} = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_k \\sin(kx)$\n\nWe can find the coefficients $a_k$ by taking the inner product of both sides with respect to the eigenfunctions:\n\n$a_k = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi} e^{-x^2}\\sin(kx) dx$\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution. However, we now have an expression for the solution $u(x,t)$ in terms of an infinite series:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_k \\sin(kx)e^{-k^2t}$, where $a_k = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi} e^{-x^2}\\sin(kx) dx$"
