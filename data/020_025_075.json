The distances between the deliveries are as follows:\n\n- Delivery 1 to Delivery 2: 8 km\n- Delivery 1 to Delivery 3: 12 km\n- Delivery 1 to Delivery 4: 15 km\n- Delivery 1 to Delivery 5: 10 km\n- Delivery 2 to Delivery 3: 6 km\n- Delivery 2 to Delivery 4: 9 km\n- Delivery 2 to Delivery 5: 11 km\n- Delivery 3 to Delivery 4: 4 km\n- Delivery 3 to Delivery 5: 7 km\n- Delivery 4 to Delivery 5: 5 km\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the delivery driver to take, starting and ending at delivery 1, to minimize the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for all possible routes and then choose the one with the shortest distance. Since there are 5 deliveries, there are 4! (4 factorial) = 24 possible routes.
