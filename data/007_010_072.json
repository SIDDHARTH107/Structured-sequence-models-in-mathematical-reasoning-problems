    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\nN1 = N/3 = 105/3 = 35\nN2 = N/5 = 105/5 = 21\nN3 = N/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 3) = 35^(-1) (mod 3)\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 5) = 21^(-1) (mod 5)\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 7) = 15^(-1) (mod 7)\n\nCalculating the modular inverses, we get:\ny1 = 2 (mod 3)\ny2 = 1 (mod 5)\ny3 = 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can find the solution x using the formula:\nx = (a1 * N1 * y1) + (a2 * N2 * y2) + (a3 * N3 * y3) (mod N)\n\nPlugging in the values from the given congruences:\nx = (2 * 35 * 2) + (3 * 21 * 1) + (2 * 15 * 1) (mod 105)\nx = (140) + (63) + (30) (mod 105)\nx = 233 (mod 105)\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruences is x = 233 % 105 = 23."
