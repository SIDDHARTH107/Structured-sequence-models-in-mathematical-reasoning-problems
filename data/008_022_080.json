    "message_2": "First, let's write down the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 2  3 -1 | -4 |\n| 4  6 -2 | -8 |\n| 8 12 -4 | -16|\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 | -2 |\n| 4  6   -2  | -8 |\n| 8 12   -4  | -16|\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 8 times the first row from the third row to eliminate the leading coefficients in the second and third rows:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 | -2  |\n| 0  0    0   |  0  |\n| 0  0    0   |  0  |\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means the system of equations is dependent. This means there are infinitely many solutions, and we cannot find a unique solution for x, y, and z. This is consistent with the fact that the coefficient matrix is ill-conditioned with a determinant close to 0."
