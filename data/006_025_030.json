    "message_1": "A magician is performing a trick in which he selects a card from a deck of 52 playing cards. What is the probability that he selects a heart card?",
    "message_2": "There are 13 heart cards in a standard deck of 52 playing cards (Ace through King of hearts). To find the probability of selecting a heart card, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (the heart cards), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (the total number of cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a heart card is:\n\nProbability = 13/52 = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a heart card is 0.25 or 25%."
