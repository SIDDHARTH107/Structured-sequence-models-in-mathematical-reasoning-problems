    "message_2": "To find the actual speed and direction of the plane, we need to consider both the plane's speed and the wind's speed as vectors and add them together.\n\nLet's represent the plane's speed vector as P and the wind's speed vector as W. We can break down each vector into its components along the x (East-West) and y (North-South) axes.\n\nFor the plane's speed vector P:\nP_x = P * cos(30°) = 400 * cos(30°) = 400 * (√3/2) ≈ 346.41 km/h (East)\nP_y = P * sin(30°) = 400 * sin(30°) = 400 * (1/2) = 200 km/h (North)\n\nFor the wind's speed vector W:\nW_x = W * cos(60°) = 50 * cos(60°) = 50 * (1/2) = 25 km/h (West)\nW_y = W * sin(60°) = 50 * sin(60°) = 50 * (√3/2) ≈ 43.30 km/h (North)\n\nNow, let's add the two vectors together:\nActual_x = P_x - W_x = 346.41 - 25 = 321.41 km/h (East)\nActual_y = P_y + W_y = 200 + 43.30 = 243.30 km/h (North)\n\nNow, we can find the actual speed and direction of the plane using the Pythagorean theorem and the arctangent function.\n\nActual speed = √(Actual_x^2 + Actual_y^2) = √(321.41^2 + 243.30^2) ≈ 404.32 km/h\n\nTo find the actual direction, we can use the arctangent function:\nActual direction = arctan(Actual_y / Actual_x) = arctan(243.30 / 321.41) ≈ 36.87°\n\nSo, the actual speed of the plane is approximately 404.32 km/h, and its direction is approximately 36.87° North of East."
