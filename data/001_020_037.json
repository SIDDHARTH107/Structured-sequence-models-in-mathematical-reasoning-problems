    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the equation |x - 3| + 2 = 5, we first need to isolate the absolute value term:\n\n|x - 3| = 5 - 2\n|x - 3| = 3\n\nNow, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x - 3 â‰¥ 0\nIn this case, the absolute value can be removed, and we have:\nx - 3 = 3\nx = 6\n\nCase 2: x - 3 < 0\nIn this case, the absolute value can be removed by multiplying the expression inside the absolute value by -1:\n-(x - 3) = 3\n-x + 3 = 3\n-x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, the solutions of the equation are x = 0 and x = 6.\n\nNow, let's find the x-coordinates of the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. The graph intersects the x-axis when the y-coordinate is 0. The given equation is already in the form of y = |x - 3| + 2. So, we set y = 0:\n\n0 = |x - 3| + 2\n\nWe need to solve for x:\n\n-2 = |x - 3|\n\nSince the absolute value of a number cannot be negative, there are no x-coordinates where the graph intersects the x-axis."
