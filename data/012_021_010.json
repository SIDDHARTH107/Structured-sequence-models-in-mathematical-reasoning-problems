    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of a graph G with 8 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.\n2. A tree decomposition of a graph G is a tree T where each node of T is associated with a subset of vertices of G, called a bag, such that:\n   a. The union of all bags is the vertex set of G.\n   b. For each edge (u, v) in G, there is a bag in T containing both u and v.\n   c. For each vertex v in G, the bags containing v form a connected subtree of T.\n3. The width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1.\n4. The treewidth of a graph G is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions of G.\n\nSince G has 8 vertices and 10 edges, it cannot be a tree, as a tree with 8 vertices would have only 7 edges. Therefore, the treewidth of G must be at least 1.\n\nNow, let's try to find a tree decomposition of G with width 2 (i.e., each bag contains at most 3 vertices). If we can find such a decomposition, the treewidth of G will be 2; otherwise, it will be larger.\n\nConsider the following procedure to construct a tree decomposition of G:\n\n1. Choose an arbitrary vertex v in G and put it in a bag B1.\n2. Choose an arbitrary neighbor u of v and put it in the same bag B1.\n3. Remove vertex v from G.\n4. If G still has vertices, go back to step 1.\n\nSince G has 8 vertices and 10 edges, we can apply this procedure at least 4 times (as each time we remove a vertex, we also remove at least one edge). After 4 iterations, we will have a tree decomposition with 4 bags, each containing 2 vertices. The width of this decomposition is 2-1 = 1, which is the minimum possible treewidth for G.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of G is 1."
