Here is a question for the math student to solve:\n\nFind the Riemann map that maps unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ onto $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus (-\\infty, 0]$ using the formula\n\n$$\nf(z)=\\frac{1+az}{a+z},\n$$\n\nwhere $a\\in(-1, 0)$ and $f(0)=\\infty$.\n\nThen, use the Riemann mapping theorem to find the conformal map that maps the upper half plane $\\mathbb{H}$ onto the region bounded by the curves $y=0$, $x^2+y^2=1$, and $y=x^2$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Riemann map that maps the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ onto $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus (-\\infty, 0]$ using the formula\n\n$$\nf(z)=\\frac{1+az}{a+z},\n$$\n\nwhere $a\\in(-1, 0)$ and $f(0)=\\infty$.\n\nSince $f(0) = \\infty$, we have\n\n$$\n\\infty = \\frac{1+0}{a+0} \\Rightarrow a = 0.\n$$\n\nHowever, this contradicts the condition that $a \\in (-1, 0)$. Instead, we should consider the limit as $z$ approaches $0$:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{z\\to 0} \\frac{1+az}{a+z}.\n$$\n\nFor this limit to be infinity, the denominator must approach zero as $z$ approaches $0$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\n\\lim_{z\\to 0} (a+z) = a = 0.\n$$\n\nThis also contradicts the condition that $a \\in (-1, 0)$. Thus, there is no such Riemann map using the given formula.\n\nNow, let's find the conformal map that maps the upper half plane $\\mathbb{H}$ onto the region bounded by the curves $y=0$, $x^2+y^2=1$, and $y=x^2$.\n\nFirst, we need to find a conformal map that maps the upper half plane $\\mathbb{H}$ to the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$. We can use the Möbius transformation:\n\n$$\ng(z) = \\frac{z-i}{z+i}.\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find a conformal map that maps the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ to the region bounded by the curves $y=0$, $x^2+y^2=1$, and $y=x^2$. Unfortunately, there is no simple formula for this conformal map. However, we can use the Riemann mapping theorem to guarantee the existence of such a map. Let's call this map $h(z)$.\n\nFinally, the conformal map that maps the upper half plane $\\mathbb{H}$ onto the region bounded by the curves $y=0$, $x^2+y^2=1$, and $y=x^2$ is the composition of the two conformal maps $g(z)$ and $h(z)$:\n\n$$\n\\phi(z) = h(g(z)) = h\\left(\\frac{z-i}{z+i}\\right).\n$$\n\nAlthough we don't have an explicit formula for $h(z)$, we know that it exists and is unique up to a composition with a Möbius transformation."
