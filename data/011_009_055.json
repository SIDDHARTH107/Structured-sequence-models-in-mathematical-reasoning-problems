    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. The Bell number B(n) gives the number of partitions for a set of n elements.\n\nFor a set of 5 elements, we need to find the Bell number B(5). The first few Bell numbers are:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo, there are 52 ways to partition a set of 5 elements using Bell numbers."
