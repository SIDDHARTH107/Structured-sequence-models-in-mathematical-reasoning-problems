    "message_1": "A Lorenz Attractor system is defined by the following system of differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\n\ndy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y\n\ndz/dt = xy - βz\n\nwhere σ = 10, ρ = 28 and β = 8/3. \n\nUsing numerical methods, solve this system of equations with initial conditions (x0, y0, z0) = (1, 1, 1) for a time span of t = 50. Then plot the x, y and z coordinates as a function of time on the same graph. \n\nWhat is the behavior of the system over time? Does it display chaotic behavior or settle into a periodic orbit?",
    "message_2": "To solve the Lorenz Attractor system, we can use a numerical method such as the Runge-Kutta method. Here's a Python code using the Runge-Kutta method to solve the system and plot the results:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef lorenz(t, xyz, sigma, rho, beta):\n    x, y, z = xyz\n    return [\n        sigma * (y - x),\n        x * (rho - z) - y,\n        x * y - beta * z\n    ]\n\nsigma = 10\nrho = 28\nbeta = 8/3\nxyz0 = [1, 1, 1]\nt_span = (0, 50)\n\nsol = solve_ivp(lorenz, t_span, xyz0, args=(sigma, rho, beta), dense_output=True)\n\nt = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 10000)\nxyz = sol.sol(t)\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(t, xyz[0], label='x')\nplt.plot(t, xyz[1], label='y')\nplt.plot(t, xyz[2], label='z')\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Coordinates')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nRunning this code will produce a plot of x, y, and z coordinates as a function of time. The behavior of the system over time appears to be chaotic, as the trajectories do not settle into a periodic orbit but instead oscillate irregularly between two regions in the phase space. This is a characteristic feature of the Lorenz Attractor, which is known for its chaotic behavior."
