    "message_2": "To maximize the number of times the resource can be used, we should alternate between the two states. We start with the first state, which can use the resource twice. After the first use, the state changes to the second state. The second state can use the resource three times, but we will only use it once to change back to the first state. Now, we can use the resource one more time in the first state. After that, we change back to the second state and use the resource two more times.\n\nSo, the maximum number of times the resource can be used is:\n\n2 (first state) + 1 (second state) + 1 (first state) + 2 (second state) = 6 times."
