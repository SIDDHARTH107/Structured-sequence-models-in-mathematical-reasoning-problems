    "message_1": "Given a smooth two-dimensional manifold $M$, assume that its second De Rham cohomology group $H^2_{dR}(M)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $\\alpha$ be a closed two-form on $M$ that represents a non-zero element of $H^2_{dR}(M)$.\n\nIf $M$ is the surface of a torus (i.e. a doughnut), what is the integral of $\\alpha$ over the entire surface of the torus?",
    "message_2": "Since $M$ is the surface of a torus, we can parameterize it using the standard coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle around the \"hole\" of the torus and $\\phi$ is the angle around the \"tube\" of the torus. Both $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ vary from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Let $R$ be the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and $r$ be the radius of the tube.\n\nThe parameterization of the torus can be given by the following function:\n\n$$\nX(\\theta, \\phi) = ((R + r\\cos\\phi)\\cos\\theta, (R + r\\cos\\phi)\\sin\\theta, r\\sin\\phi)\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the tangent vectors with respect to $\\theta$ and $\\phi$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\theta} = (-(R + r\\cos\\phi)\\sin\\theta, (R + r\\cos\\phi)\\cos\\theta, 0)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\phi} = (-r\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta, -r\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta, r\\sin\\phi)\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the area form $\\omega$ by taking the wedge product of the tangent vectors and their dual one-forms:\n\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\theta} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\phi} = (R + r\\cos\\phi)r\\, d\\theta \\wedge d\\phi\n$$\n\nSince $\\alpha$ is a closed two-form on $M$ that represents a non-zero element of $H^2_{dR}(M)$, there exists a constant $c$ such that $\\alpha = c\\omega$. Now, we can compute the integral of $\\alpha$ over the entire surface of the torus:\n\n$$\n\\int_M \\alpha = \\int_M c\\omega = c \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (R + r\\cos\\phi)r\\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\n\nWe can compute the inner integral first:\n\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} (R + r\\cos\\phi)r\\, d\\phi = r^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos\\phi\\, d\\phi + Rr \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = 2\\pi Rr\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the outer integral:\n\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} 2\\pi Rr\\, d\\theta = 2\\pi Rr \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 4\\pi^2 Rr\n$$\n\nTherefore, the integral of $\\alpha$ over the entire surface of the torus is:\n\n$$\n\\int_M \\alpha = c \\cdot 4\\pi^2 Rr\n$$\n\nSince $c$ is a constant, we cannot determine its value without more information. However, we have found the expression for the integral of $\\alpha$ over the entire surface of the torus in terms of the constant $c$ and the geometric parameters $R$ and $r$."
