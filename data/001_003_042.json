    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the y variable:\n\nx + y = 7\n2x - y = 4\n\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n\nx + y + 2x - y = 7 + 4\n3x = 11\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 11 / 3\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the first equation:\n\nx + y = 7\n(11 / 3) + y = 7\n\nTo solve for y, subtract (11 / 3) from both sides:\n\ny = 7 - (11 / 3)\ny = (21 / 3) - (11 / 3)\ny = 10 / 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 11 / 3\ny = 10 / 3"
