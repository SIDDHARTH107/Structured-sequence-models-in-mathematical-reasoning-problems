    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 3, b = 4, and c = -2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (the part inside the square root):\n\nΔ = b^2 - 4ac\nΔ = (4)^2 - 4(3)(-2)\nΔ = 16 + 24\nΔ = 40\n\nNow, we can plug the values of a, b, and Δ into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-4 ± √40) / 6\n\nWe have two solutions, one for the positive square root and one for the negative square root:\n\nx₁ = (-4 + √40) / 6\nx₂ = (-4 - √40) / 6\n\nThese are the two values of x that satisfy the equation 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0:\n\nx₁ ≈ 0.4495\nx₂ ≈ -1.4828"
