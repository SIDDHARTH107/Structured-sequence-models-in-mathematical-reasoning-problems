    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and its two bases measure 5 cm and 12 cm respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (sum of bases) × height\n\nIn this case, the height is 8 cm, and the two bases are 5 cm and 12 cm. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (5 + 12) × 8\n\nArea = (1/2) × 17 × 8\n\nArea = 8.5 × 8\n\nArea = 68 cm²\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 68 square centimeters."
