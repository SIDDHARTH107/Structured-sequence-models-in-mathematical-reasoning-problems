    "message_1": "Consider the rational curve C given by the equation f(t) = (t^2 + 1, t^3 + t). \n\nWhat is the degree of the curve C?",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of the curve C, we need to eliminate the parameter t from the parametric equations x = t^2 + 1 and y = t^3 + t. We can do this by solving one of the equations for t and substituting it into the other equation.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have x = t^2 + 1, so t^2 = x - 1. Now, we can substitute this into the second equation:\n\ny = t^3 + t = (t^2)^(3/2) + t = ((x - 1)^(3/2)) + t.\n\nNow, we need to express t in terms of x and substitute it back into the equation. From the first equation, we have t^2 = x - 1, so t = ±√(x - 1). Substituting this into the equation for y, we get:\n\ny = ±(x - 1)^(3/2) + √(x - 1) or y = ±(x - 1)^(3/2) - √(x - 1).\n\nNow, we can see that the highest power of x in the equation for y is (x - 1)^(3/2), which means that the degree of the curve C is 3."
