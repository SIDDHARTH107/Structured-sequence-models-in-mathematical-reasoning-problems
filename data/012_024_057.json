    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph G, we can use the formula:\n\ng = (e - n + 1)/2\n\nwhere g is the genus, e is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn this case, we have e = 15 and n = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ng = (15 - 10 + 1)/2\ng = (6)/2\ng = 3\n\nTherefore, the genus of the graph G is 3."
