    "message_2": "To show that every group of order 10 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10, we can use the Sylow theorems and the properties of groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 10. The prime factorization of 10 is 2 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, G has a Sylow 5-subgroup P of order 5 and a Sylow 2-subgroup Q of order 2. Since 5 is prime, P is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5, and since 2 is prime, Q is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group of order 10 (C10): If G has an element of order 10, then G is a cyclic group of order 10. In this case, G is isomorphic to C10.\n\n2. G is a dihedral group of order 10 (D5): If G does not have an element of order 10, but the product of elements from P and Q has order 10, then G is the dihedral group of order 10. In this case, G is isomorphic to D5.\n\n3. G is a non-abelian group of order 10: If G does not have an element of order 10 and the product of elements from P and Q does not have order 10, then G is a non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nHowever, this last case is not possible. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime (5 and 2), their intersection is trivial, i.e., P âˆ© Q = {e}, where e is the identity element. Also, the product of their orders is equal to the order of G (5 * 2 = 10). By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, which means G is either the direct product of P and Q (abelian) or a non-trivial semidirect product (non-abelian). But since G is not cyclic, it cannot be the direct product of P and Q. Therefore, G must be a non-trivial semidirect product, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 10 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. There is no non-abelian group of order 10 that is not isomorphic to D5."
