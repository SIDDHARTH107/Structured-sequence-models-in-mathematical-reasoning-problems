    "message_1": "Consider a two-player game, where Player 1 can choose to either cooperate or defect, and similarly Player 2 can choose to cooperate or defect. If both players cooperate, each gets a reward of 3. If one player defects and the other cooperates, the defector gets a reward of 5 while the cooperator receives nothing. If both players defect, each gets a reward of 1. If before the game, Player 1 can send a message to Player 2, but the message cannot contain any new information, how many possible distinct messages can Player 1 use to improve his outcome?",
    "message_2": "Since the message cannot contain any new information, it cannot directly influence Player 2's decision. However, Player 1 can still use the message to signal their intention or try to establish trust. There are two main messages Player 1 can send:\n\n1. A message indicating their intention to cooperate: This message can be something like \"I will cooperate\" or \"Let's both cooperate for mutual benefit.\" The goal of this message is to establish trust and encourage Player 2 to cooperate as well.\n\n2. A message indicating their intention to defect: This message can be something like \"I will defect\" or \"I don't trust you, so I will defect.\" The goal of this message is to make Player 2 believe that Player 1 will defect, which might lead Player 2 to cooperate in the hope of getting a higher payoff than if they both defect.\n\nThese two distinct messages can be used by Player 1 to try to improve their outcome. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these messages depends on the credibility of the sender and the receiver's interpretation of the message."
