    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method for solving a system of nonlinear equations, we first need to find the Jacobian matrix of the given system. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function.\n\nLet F(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)), where f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 25 and f2(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 7.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = 2y\n∂f2/∂x = 2x\n∂f2/∂y = -2y\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x  2y |\n          | 2x -2y |\n\nNow, we need to choose an initial guess for the solution (x0, y0). Let's take (x0, y0) = (3, 4) as our initial guess, which is close to the actual solution.\n\nNewton's method formula for a system of nonlinear equations is:\n\n(x1, y1) = (x0, y0) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0)\n\nWe first compute F(x0, y0):\n\nF(3, 4) = (3^2 + 4^2 - 25, 3^2 - 4^2 - 7) = (0, -14)\n\nNow, we compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix at (x0, y0):\n\nJ(3, 4) = | 6  8 |\n          | 6 -8 |\n\nThe determinant of J(3, 4) is:\n\ndet(J(3, 4)) = (6 * -8) - (8 * 6) = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSince the determinant is 0, the Jacobian matrix is singular and its inverse does not exist. Therefore, we cannot apply Newton's method directly to this system of equations.\n\nHowever, we can try to solve the system of equations using other methods, such as substitution or elimination. In this case, we can solve the first equation for x^2:\n\nx^2 = 25 - y^2\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n(25 - y^2) - y^2 = 7\n\nSolve for y^2:\n\n2y^2 = 18\ny^2 = 9\n\nSo, y = ±3. Now, we can find the corresponding x values:\n\nx^2 = 25 - 9\nx^2 = 16\n\nSo, x = ±4. Therefore, the solutions to the system of equations are (4, 3), (-4, 3), (4, -3), and (-4, -3)."
