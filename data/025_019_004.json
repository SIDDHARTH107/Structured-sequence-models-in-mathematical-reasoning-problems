    "message_2": "Let D be a divisor on the smooth Fano threefold X. Since X has Picard number 1, any divisor on X is linearly equivalent to some multiple of the anticanonical divisor -K_X. Let's say D is linearly equivalent to m times the anticanonical divisor, i.e., D ≡ m(-K_X).\n\nNow, we are given that the anticanonical degree of X is 8, which means the degree of -K_X is 8. The degree of a divisor is the intersection number of the divisor with itself and the anticanonical divisor, i.e., deg(D) = D · D · (-K_X).\n\nWe want to compute the degree of a divisor that is linearly equivalent to 3 times the anticanonical divisor. So, we have D ≡ 3(-K_X). To find the degree of D, we compute the intersection number:\n\ndeg(D) = D · D · (-K_X) = (3(-K_X)) · (3(-K_X)) · (-K_X) = 3^2(-K_X) · (-K_X) · (-K_X) = 9(-K_X) · (-K_X) · (-K_X).\n\nSince the degree of -K_X is 8, we have:\n\ndeg(D) = 9(-K_X) · (-K_X) · (-K_X) = 9(8) = 72.\n\nTherefore, the degree of a divisor that is linearly equivalent to 3 times the anticanonical divisor is 72."
