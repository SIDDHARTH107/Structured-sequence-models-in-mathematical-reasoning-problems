    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 500 liters of water. Water flows into the tank at a rate of 10 liters/min for the first 20 minutes and then at 5 liters/min for the next 30 minutes. If water flows out of the tank at a rate proportional to the amount of water present, and the tank is completely emptied at the end of the 50 minutes, find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 40 minutes. Solve the resulting differential equation to obtain the solution.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount of water in the tank at time t as W(t). We are given that water flows into the tank at a rate of 10 liters/min for the first 20 minutes and then at 5 liters/min for the next 30 minutes. Let's denote the inflow rate as R(t). Then,\n\nR(t) = 10 liters/min for 0 <= t <= 20\nR(t) = 5 liters/min for 20 < t <= 50\n\nWe are also given that water flows out of the tank at a rate proportional to the amount of water present. Let k be the proportionality constant. Then, the outflow rate is given by k * W(t).\n\nNow, we can write the differential equation for the amount of water in the tank:\n\ndW/dt = R(t) - k * W(t)\n\nWe need to find W(40), given that W(0) = 500 and W(50) = 0.\n\nFirst, let's solve the differential equation for 0 <= t <= 20:\n\ndW/dt = 10 - k * W(t)\n\nWe can solve this first-order linear differential equation using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by e^(∫-k dt) = e^(-kt). Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n\ne^(-kt) * dW/dt + k * e^(-kt) * W(t) = 10 * e^(-kt)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product (W(t) * e^(-kt)):\n\nd(W(t) * e^(-kt))/dt = 10 * e^(-kt)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d(W(t) * e^(-kt))/dt dt = ∫10 * e^(-kt) dt\n\nW(t) * e^(-kt) = (-10/k) * e^(-kt) + C1\n\nNow, multiply both sides by e^(kt) to isolate W(t):\n\nW(t) = (-10/k) + C1 * e^(kt)\n\nUsing the initial condition W(0) = 500, we can find C1:\n\n500 = (-10/k) + C1 * e^(0)\nC1 = 500 + 10/k\n\nNow, let's solve the differential equation for 20 < t <= 50:\n\ndW/dt = 5 - k * W(t)\n\nFollowing the same procedure as before, we get:\n\nW(t) = (-5/k) + C2 * e^(kt)\n\nAt t = 20, the amount of water in the tank is:\n\nW(20) = 500 + 10/k - 20 * (10 - k * (500 + 10/k))\n\nNow, we can find C2 using the continuity condition W(20) = W(20):\n\n(-5/k) + C2 * e^(20k) = 500 + 10/k - 20 * (10 - k * (500 + 10/k))\n\nC2 = (5/k - 500 - 10/k + 20 * (10 - k * (500 + 10/k))) * e^(-20k)\n\nNow, we can find W(40) using the second part of the solution:\n\nW(40) = (-5/k) + (5/k - 500 - 10/k + 20 * (10 - k * (500 + 10/k))) * e^(-20k) * e^(40k)\n\nW(40) = (-5/k) + (5/k - 500 - 10/k + 20 * (10 - k * (500 + 10/k))) * e^(20k)\n\nTo find the value of k, we can use the final condition W(50) = 0:\n\n0 = (-5/k) + (5/k - 500 - 10/k + 20 * (10 - k * (500 + 10/k))) * e^(30k)\n\nThis is a transcendental equation for k, which is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can solve it numerically to find the approximate value of k. Once we have the value of k, we can substitute it back into the expression for W(40) to find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 40 minutes."
