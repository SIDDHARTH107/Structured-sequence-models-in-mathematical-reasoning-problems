    "message_2": "The number of possible unique encryption keys for a block cipher with a key size of 128 bits is 2^128. This is because each bit can have two possible values (0 or 1), and there are 128 bits in the key. So, the total number of unique keys is 2 multiplied by itself 128 times, which is 2^128 or approximately 3.4 x 10^38 keys."
