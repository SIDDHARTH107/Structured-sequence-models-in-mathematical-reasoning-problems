Alice's secret value is a = 6 and Bob's secret value is b = 15. Calculate the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for secure communication.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public value (A) using the formula: A = g^a mod p\n   A = 5^6 mod 23\n   A = 15625 mod 23\n   A = 8\n\n2. Bob computes his public value (B) using the formula: B = g^b mod p\n   B = 5^15 mod 23\n   B = 30517578125 mod 23\n   B = 19\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = B^a mod p\n   S = 19^6 mod 23\n   S = 47045881 mod 23\n   S = 2\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = A^b mod p\n   S = 8^15 mod 23\n   S = 35184372088832 mod 23\n   S = 2\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key, S = 2. They can now use this key for secure communication."
