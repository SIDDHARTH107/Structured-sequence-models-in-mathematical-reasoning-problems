    "message_2": "1. Compute N = p * q:\nN = 17 * 11 = 187\n\n2. Compute Φ = (p-1) * (q-1):\nΦ = (17 - 1) * (11 - 1) = 16 * 10 = 160\n\n3. Find e, the encryption key which is coprime with Φ and less than Φ:\nWe need to find a number e such that 1 < e < 160 and gcd(e, 160) = 1. Let's try e = 3:\ngcd(3, 160) = 1, so e = 3 is a valid encryption key.\n\n4. Find d, the decryption key which satisfies d * e = 1 mod Φ:\nWe need to find a number d such that (d * e) % Φ = 1. In other words, we need to find the modular inverse of e (which is 3) modulo Φ (which is 160).\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular inverse of 3 modulo 160:\n\nExtended Euclidean Algorithm for 3 and 160:\n\n1. 160 = 3 * 53 + 1\n2. 1 = 160 - 3 * 53\n\nFrom step 2, we can see that the modular inverse of 3 modulo 160 is -53. However, we need a positive value for d, so we add 160 to -53:\n\nd = -53 + 160 = 107\n\nSo, the decryption key d is 107.\n\nIn summary:\n1. N = 187\n2. Φ = 160\n3. e = 3\n4. d = 107"
