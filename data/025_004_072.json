    "message_2": "To find the degree and genus of the curve, we first need to homogenize the equation. We introduce a new variable $z$ and multiply both sides of the equation by $(x+1)z$ to eliminate the denominator:\n\n$yz = 2xz + 2z^2$.\n\nNow we have a homogeneous equation in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. The degree of the curve is the highest total degree of any monomial in the equation, which in this case is 2 (from the term $2z^2$). So, the degree of the curve is 2.\n\nFor a smooth projective curve of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, the genus $g$ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$.\n\nIn our case, $d = 2$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(2-1)(2-2)}{2} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 0}{2} = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the curve is 2 and the genus is 0."
