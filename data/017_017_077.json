    "message_2": "Let's first find the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. The order of G is 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5. According to Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted as n_5, must divide the order of G and also satisfy n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possible divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. Among these, only 1 and 6 satisfy the congruence condition n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). \n\nIf n_5 = 1, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, which is normal in G. In this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 5 and a normal subgroup of order 2 * 3 = 6 (by Sylow's Theorem for 2 and 3). Since the orders of these normal subgroups are coprime, G is the direct product of these subgroups, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n\nIf n_5 = 6, there are six Sylow 5-subgroups. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, as C30 has a unique subgroup of order 5. Now we need to determine if G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15 or the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nThe dihedral group D15 has 30 elements, with 15 rotations and 15 reflections. The rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 15, which has a unique subgroup of order 5. However, since G has six Sylow 5-subgroups, G cannot be isomorphic to D15.\n\nTherefore, if n_5 = 6, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G helps to determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30. If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, G is isomorphic to C30. If there are six Sylow 5-subgroups, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30."
