    "message_1": "Suppose you are working on a manufacturing floor and you are tasked with optimizing the production process for a new product. You have identified 4 different stages in the process, each with a variable duration that determines the time it takes to complete a unit of the product. You want to use the Cuckoo Search algorithm to find the shortest amount of time it would take to produce 1000 units of the product. The duration of each stage is given by:\n\nStage 1: 12 + x1\nStage 2: 10 + x2\nStage 3: 8 + x3\nStage 4: 14 + x4\n\nwhere x1, x2, x3, and x4 are the decision variables that represent the adjustment in time that can be made in each stage. Use the Cuckoo Search algorithm to determine the optimal values of x1, x2, x3, and x4 that minimize the amount of time it takes to produce 1000 units of the product.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Cuckoo Search algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of cuckoos (solutions) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each cuckoo (the total time to produce 1000 units).\n3. Perform the search process, which includes:\n   a. Choose a cuckoo randomly and generate a new solution using a Levy flight.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. If the new solution is better than the worst solution in the nest, replace the worst solution with the new one.\n   d. Perform a fraction of the worst solutions replacement with new random solutions.\n4. Repeat steps 3a-3d until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nHere's a simplified implementation of the Cuckoo Search algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef fitness(x1, x2, x3, x4):\n    return 1000 * (12 + x1 + 10 + x2 + 8 + x3 + 14 + x4)\n\ndef levy_flight(beta=1.5, size=1):\n    sigma_u = (np.gamma(1 + beta) * np.sin(np.pi * beta / 2) / (np.gamma((1 + beta) / 2) * beta * 2 ** ((beta - 1) / 2))) ** (1 / beta)\n    u = np.random.normal(0, sigma_u, size=size)\n    v = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=size)\n    return u / (np.abs(v) ** (1 / beta))\n\ndef cuckoo_search(n_cuckoos=25, n_iterations=1000, pa=0.25):\n    cuckoos = np.random.uniform(-10, 10, size=(n_cuckoos, 4))\n    cuckoo_fitness = np.array([fitness(*cuckoo) for cuckoo in cuckoos])\n\n    for _ in range(n_iterations):\n        idx = np.random.randint(n_cuckoos)\n        new_cuckoo = cuckoos[idx] + levy_flight(size=4)\n        new_fitness = fitness(*new_cuckoo)\n\n        if new_fitness < cuckoo_fitness.max():\n            cuckoos[np.argmax(cuckoo_fitness)] = new_cuckoo\n            cuckoo_fitness[np.argmax(cuckoo_fitness)] = new_fitness\n\n        worst_cuckoos = np.random.rand(n_cuckoos) < pa\n        cuckoos[worst_cuckoos] = np.random.uniform(-10, 10, size=(worst_cuckoos.sum(), 4))\n        cuckoo_fitness[worst_cuckoos] = np.array([fitness(*cuckoo) for cuckoo in cuckoos[worst_cuckoos]])\n\n    best_cuckoo = cuckoos[np.argmin(cuckoo_fitness)]\n    return best_cuckoo\n\noptimal_values = cuckoo_search()\nprint(\"Optimal values of x1, x2, x3, and x4:\", optimal_values)\n```\n\nThis code will output the optimal values of x1, x2, x3, and x4 that minimize the amount of time it takes to produce 1000 units of the product. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. You can increase the number of iterations or the number of cuckoos to improve the accuracy of the solution."
