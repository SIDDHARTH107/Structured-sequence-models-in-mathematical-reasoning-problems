    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext, we first need to calculate n and then use the RSA encryption formula.\n\n1. Calculate n = pq\nn = 17 * 19\nn = 323\n\nNow that we have n, we can use the RSA encryption formula to compute the ciphertext (C) from the message (M) and the public key (e, n):\n\n2. C = M^e mod n\nC = 3^5 mod 323\nC = 243 mod 323\nC = 243\n\nSo, the ciphertext that Bob sends to Alice is 243."
