    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve at any point t. We can do this by taking the derivative of the position vector r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr(t) = cos(t)i + sin(t)j + tk\ndr(t)/dt = -sin(t)i + cos(t)j + k\n\nNow, let's normalize the tangent vector T(t) to get the unit tangent vector:\n\nT(t) = (-sin(t)i + cos(t)j + k) / ||(-sin(t)i + cos(t)j + k)||\n\nThe magnitude of the tangent vector is:\n\n||(-sin(t)i + cos(t)j + k)|| = sqrt((-sin(t))^2 + cos(t)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the unit tangent vector is:\n\nT(t) = (-sin(t)i + cos(t)j + k) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve. The parallel transport equation is given by:\n\ndv(t)/dt + (v(t) • ∇)T(t) = 0\n\nWe need to find the covariant derivative of the unit tangent vector T(t):\n\n(∇)T(t) = dT(t)/dt + (T(t) • ∇)T(t)\n\nTaking the derivative of T(t) with respect to t:\n\ndT(t)/dt = (-cos(t)i - sin(t)j) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the dot product of T(t) and the gradient of T(t):\n\n(T(t) • ∇)T(t) = (-sin(t)i + cos(t)j + k) • (-cos(t)i - sin(t)j) / sqrt(2)\n\nThis dot product is zero because the unit tangent vector T(t) is orthogonal to its derivative dT(t)/dt.\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of the unit tangent vector T(t) is:\n\n(∇)T(t) = dT(t)/dt = (-cos(t)i - sin(t)j) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the parallel transport equation:\n\ndv(t)/dt + (v(t) • (-cos(t)i - sin(t)j) / sqrt(2)) = 0\n\nSince the vector v is constant (4i + 3j - 2k), its derivative with respect to t is zero:\n\ndv(t)/dt = 0\n\nSo, the parallel transport equation becomes:\n\n(4i + 3j - 2k) • (-cos(t)i - sin(t)j) / sqrt(2) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied for all values of t, which means that the vector v is parallel transported along the curve without changing its components. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector v from t = 0 to t = 2π is:\n\nv_parallel = 4i + 3j - 2k"
