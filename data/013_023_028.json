    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A is given $10 and is asked to decide how much money to send to Player B. Whatever amount sent by A is tripled by the experimenter and then given to B. B then decides how much of this amount (if any) to return to A. Suppose A sends $4 to B. If B returns 50% of the amount received from A, what is the amount of money received by A at the end of the game?",
    "message_2": "Player A sends $4 to Player B. The experimenter triples this amount, so Player B receives 4 * 3 = $12. Player B decides to return 50% of the amount received, which is 12 * 0.5 = $6.\n\nPlayer A initially had $10 and sent $4 to Player B, so they have $10 - $4 = $6 left. After receiving $6 back from Player B, Player A has a total of $6 + $6 = $12 at the end of the game."
