    "message_2": "To find the lengths of the new line segments formed after the first 5 transformations, we need to consider the scaling factors of each transformation. The Barnsley fern fractal is generated using the following affine transformations:\n\n1. f1(x, y) = (0, 0.16y) with probability P1 = 0.01\n2. f2(x, y) = (0.85x + 0.04y, -0.04x + 0.85y + 1.6) with probability P2 = 0.85\n3. f3(x, y) = (0.2x - 0.26y, 0.23x + 0.22y + 1.6) with probability P3 = 0.07\n4. f4(x, y) = (-0.15x + 0.28y, 0.26x + 0.24y + 0.44) with probability P4 = 0.07\n\nThe scaling factor for each transformation can be calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients of x and y in the transformation. For example, for f2, the scaling factor is sqrt((0.85)^2 + (0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.7225 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.7241) ≈ 0.851.\n\nScaling factors for each transformation:\n1. sf1 = sqrt(0^2 + 0.16^2) = 0.16\n2. sf2 = sqrt(0.85^2 + 0.04^2) ≈ 0.851\n3. sf3 = sqrt(0.2^2 + (-0.26)^2) ≈ 0.326\n4. sf4 = sqrt((-0.15)^2 + 0.28^2) ≈ 0.317\n\nNow, we need to find the expected length of the line segment after each transformation. We can do this by multiplying the scaling factor of each transformation by its probability and summing the results.\n\nExpected length after 1 transformation:\nE1 = P1 * sf1 + P2 * sf2 + P3 * sf3 + P4 * sf4\nE1 = 0.01 * 0.16 + 0.85 * 0.851 + 0.07 * 0.326 + 0.07 * 0.317\nE1 ≈ 0.0016 + 0.72285 + 0.02282 + 0.02219 ≈ 0.76947\n\nTo find the expected length after 5 transformations, we can raise the expected length after 1 transformation to the power of 5:\n\nE5 = (E1)^5 ≈ (0.76947)^5 ≈ 0.164\n\nSo, the lengths of the new line segments formed after the first 5 transformations are approximately 0.164 units long."
