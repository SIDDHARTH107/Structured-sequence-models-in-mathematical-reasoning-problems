    "message_2": "Let's denote the angle between the sides of length 6 and 8 as θ. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the cosine of this angle. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle θ opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(θ)\n\nIn this case, a = 6, b = 8, and c = 10. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n10² = 6² + 8² - 2 * 6 * 8 * cos(θ)\n\n100 = 36 + 64 - 96 * cos(θ)\n\n100 = 100 - 96 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can isolate cos(θ):\n\n0 = - 96 * cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0:\n\nθ = arccos(0)\n\nθ = 90°\n\nSo, the angle between the sides of length 6 and 8 in the triangle is 90°."
