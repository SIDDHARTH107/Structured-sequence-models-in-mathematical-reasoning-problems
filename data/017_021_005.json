    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order p^n * m, where p is a prime not dividing m, is congruent to 1 mod p and divides m.\n\nThe prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. So, we need to find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups (order 16):\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups is either 1 or 3 (since it must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2).\n- If there is only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups (order 3):\n- The number of Sylow 3-subgroups is either 1 or 16 (since it must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 mod 3).\n- If there is only 1 Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal.\n\nNow, we can use the following cases to find the non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\nCase 1: Both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are normal.\n- In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, so G ≅ C_16 × C_3, where C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n.\n- There are 5 groups of order 16 (C_16, C_8 × C_2, C_4 × C_4, C_4 × C_2 × C_2, and D_8, where D_n denotes the dihedral group of order n).\n- So, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nCase 2: Only the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal.\n- In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups, so G ≅ C_16 ⋊ C_3 or G ≅ (C_8 × C_2) ⋊ C_3.\n- There are no non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: Only the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.\n- In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups, so G ≅ C_3 ⋊ C_16 or G ≅ C_3 ⋊ (C_8 × C_2).\n- There are 2 non-isomorphic groups in this case (QD_16 and C_3 ⋊ (C_4 × C_4), where QD_n denotes the quasi-dihedral group of order n).\n\nSo, there are a total of 5 + 0 + 2 = 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 48. These groups are:\n\n1. C_48\n2. C_24 × C_2\n3. C_16 × C_3\n4. C_8 × C_2 × C_3\n5. C_4 × C_4 × C_3\n6. QD_16\n7. C_3 ⋊ (C_4 × C_4)"
