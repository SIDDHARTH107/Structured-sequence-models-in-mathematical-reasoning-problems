    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle does not depend on the length of the initial equilateral triangle used to construct it. The Hausdorff dimension is a measure of the fractal's complexity and self-similarity.\n\nTo find the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(r)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, there are N = 3 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of r = 2 compared to the original triangle.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2) â‰ˆ 1.58496\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.58496, regardless of the initial triangle's length."
