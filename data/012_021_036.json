    "message_2": "A graph with treewidth 4 can be represented by a tree decomposition where each bag has at most 5 vertices (treewidth + 1). To separate this graph into bags of treewidth at most 3, we need to ensure that each bag has at most 4 vertices.\n\nIn the worst case, we might need to separate every bag in the original tree decomposition. Since each bag in the original decomposition has at most 5 vertices, we can always separate it into two bags of at most 4 vertices by removing a single vertex separator.\n\nTherefore, in the worst case, the minimum number of vertex separators needed to separate the graph into bags of treewidth at most 3 is equal to the number of bags in the original tree decomposition."
