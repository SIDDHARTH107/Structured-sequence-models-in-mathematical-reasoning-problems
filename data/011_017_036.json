    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we are considering 4x4 Latin squares using the numbers 1 to 4.\n\nFor the first row, there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the numbers 1 to 4, which is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\nFor the second row, we have 3 choices for the first position (since it cannot be the same as the number above it), 2 choices for the second position (again, it cannot be the same as the number above it), and only 1 choice for the third position (since it cannot be the same as the numbers above it or the remaining number). The last position is then determined. So, there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to arrange the second row.\n\nFor the third row, we have 2 choices for the first position and 2 choices for the second position. The remaining two positions are determined. So, there are 2 × 2 = 4 ways to arrange the third row.\n\nThe fourth row is then determined by the previous rows, so there is only 1 way to arrange it.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4x4 Latin squares using the numbers 1 to 4 is 24 × 6 × 4 = 576."
