    "message_1": "A rectangular plate has dimensions 2 meters by 3 meters. The plate is heated along its two longer sides at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius and is insulated on the two shorter sides. Find the steady-state temperature distribution within the plate using the Fourier transform. Assume the thermal diffusivity of the plate is 0.1 cm^2/s and the initial temperature throughout the plate is 20 degrees Celsius.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution within the plate, we can use the two-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α * (∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature at point (x, y) and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 3, t) = 100°C for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2\n2. ∂T(0, y, t) / ∂x = ∂T(2, y, t) / ∂x = 0 for 0 ≤ y ≤ 3 (insulated sides)\n\nSince we are interested in the steady-state temperature distribution, we can set ∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = 0. This simplifies the heat equation to:\n\n0 = α * (∂²T(x, y) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y) / ∂y²)\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform to solve this equation. Let T(x, y) = X(x) * Y(y). Substituting this into the equation and dividing by α * X(x) * Y(y), we get:\n\n(1 / αX(x)) * ∂²X(x) / ∂x² + (1 / αY(y)) * ∂²Y(y) / ∂y² = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ². Then, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n∂²X(x) / ∂x² = -λ²αX(x)\n∂²Y(y) / ∂y² = λ²αY(y)\n\nSolving these equations with the given boundary conditions, we get the following solutions:\n\nX(x) = cosh(λx)\nY(y) = A * cos(λy) + B * sin(λy)\n\nThe temperature distribution T(x, y) can be expressed as a sum of products of X(x) and Y(y):\n\nT(x, y) = Σ [cosh(λx) * (A_n * cos(nπy / 3) + B_n * sin(nπy / 3))]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n and B_n, we can use the initial temperature condition T(x, y, 0) = 20°C and the boundary conditions. After applying these conditions and using Fourier series techniques, we get:\n\nT(x, y) = 20 + (40/π) * Σ [(((-1)^n - 1) / n) * sinh(nπx / 3) * sin(nπy / 3)]\n\nThis is the steady-state temperature distribution within the plate. Note that the series converges for large n, so you can approximate the temperature distribution by taking a finite number of terms in the series."
