    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Hyperbolic Law of Cosines for Angles. The formula is given by:\n\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) - sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the hyperbolic triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c.\n\nGiven the angles of the hyperbolic triangle are 60°, 70°, and 50°, we can find the shortest side by comparing the angles. The shortest side will be opposite the smallest angle, which is 50°. Therefore, we want to find the length of side c, with angle C = 50°.\n\nThe curvature of the hyperbolic plane is given as -1.5. To find the relationship between the lengths of the sides and the angles, we need to use the formula:\n\nArea = (π - (A + B + C)) * (-1/K)\n\nwhere A, B, and C are the angles of the triangle, and K is the curvature of the hyperbolic plane. In our case, K = -1.5.\n\nArea = (π - (60° + 70° + 50°)) * (-1/-1.5)\nArea = (π - 180°) * (1/1.5)\nArea = (π - π) * (2/3)\nArea = 0\n\nSince the area of the triangle is 0, this means that the triangle is degenerate, and the length of the shortest side (side c) is 0."
