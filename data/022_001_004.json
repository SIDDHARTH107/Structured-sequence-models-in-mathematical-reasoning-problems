    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 + 1) along the path γ: t → e^(2πit) for t ∈ [0, 1], we first need to parameterize the function in terms of t using the given path.\n\nLet z(t) = e^(2πit). Then, we can rewrite f(z) in terms of t as:\n\nf(t) = (e^(6πit) - 1)/(e^(4πit) + 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the analytic continuation of f(t) along the path t ∈ [0, 1]. Since f(t) is a rational function, it is analytic everywhere except for its poles. To find the poles, we need to solve the equation e^(4πit) + 1 = 0.\n\ne^(4πit) = -1\n4πit = (2k + 1)πi, for some integer k\nt = (2k + 1)/8, for some integer k\n\nThe poles of f(t) occur at t = (2k + 1)/8 for integer values of k. Since t ∈ [0, 1], the only poles that we need to consider are at t = 1/8 and t = 7/8.\n\nNow, we can find the analytic continuation of f(t) along the path t ∈ [0, 1] by avoiding these poles. One way to do this is to slightly deform the path around the poles. For example, we can use the following path:\n\nt → e^(2πit) + ε(t), where ε(t) is a small perturbation that avoids the poles at t = 1/8 and t = 7/8.\n\nThe analytic continuation of f(z) along this deformed path will be the same as the original function, since the function is analytic everywhere except for its poles. Therefore, the analytic continuation of f(z) along the path γ: t → e^(2πit) for t ∈ [0, 1] is the same as the original function:\n\nf(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^2 + 1)"
