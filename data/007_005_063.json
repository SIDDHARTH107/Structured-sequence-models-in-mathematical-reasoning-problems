    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 36 and 48, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 36: 2^2 * 3^2\nPrime factorization of 48: 2^4 * 3^1\n\nNow, we take the highest powers of each prime factor present in both numbers:\n2^4 * 3^2\n\nMultiply these prime factors together:\n16 * 9 = 144\n\nSo, the LCM of 36 and 48 is 144."
