    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = 1, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we parameterize the surface using two parameters u and v:\n\nx(u, v) = cos(u) * sqrt(1 - 2v^2)\ny(u, v) = sin(u) * sqrt(1 - 2v^2)\nz(u, v) = v\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = (dx/du)^2 + (dy/du)^2 + (dz/du)^2 = 1 - 2v^2\nF = (dx/du)(dx/dv) + (dy/du)(dy/dv) + (dz/du)(dz/dv) = 0\nG = (dx/dv)^2 + (dy/dv)^2 + (dz/dv)^2 = 2\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations for geodesics are given by:\n\nd(∂L/∂x')/dτ - ∂L/∂x = 0\nd(∂L/∂y')/dτ - ∂L/∂y = 0\nd(∂L/∂z')/dτ - ∂L/∂z = 0\n\nwhere L = (1/2)(E(x')^2 + 2F(x')(y') + G(y')^2) is the Lagrangian and τ is the parameter along the geodesic.\n\nSince F = 0, the Euler-Lagrange equations simplify to:\n\nd(Ex')/dτ = 0\nd(Gy')/dτ = 0\n\nIntegrating these equations, we obtain:\n\nEx' = C1\nGy' = C2\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are constants of integration.\n\nNow, we need to find the initial conditions. The point (1,0,0) corresponds to u = 0 and v = 0. The tangent vector at this point making an angle of 45 degrees with the x-axis can be found by taking the derivative of the parameterization with respect to u and v:\n\nx'(0,0) = -sin(0) * sqrt(1 - 2(0)^2) = 0\ny'(0,0) = cos(0) * sqrt(1 - 2(0)^2) = 1\nz'(0,0) = 0\n\nSince the angle between the tangent vector and the x-axis is 45 degrees, we have:\n\ncos(45) = x'(0,0) / sqrt(x'(0,0)^2 + y'(0,0)^2 + z'(0,0)^2) = 0 / sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = 0\n\nThis implies that the geodesic is a curve lying in the yz-plane. Therefore, x'(u,v) = 0, and from the equation Ex' = C1, we have C1 = 0.\n\nNow, we can solve for y'(u,v) and z'(u,v) using the equations:\n\nGy' = C2\n2y' = C2\n\nIntegrating this equation, we obtain:\n\ny(u,v) = (C2/2) * u + C3\n\nSince y(0,0) = 0, we have C3 = 0. Thus, the geodesic is given by:\n\ny(u,v) = (C2/2) * u\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for y(u,v) back into the parameterization:\n\nx(u, v) = cos(u) * sqrt(1 - 2v^2) = 0\ny(u, v) = sin(u) * sqrt(1 - 2v^2) = (C2/2) * u\n\nFrom the first equation, we have cos(u) = 0, which implies that u = π/2 + nπ, where n is an integer. Substituting this into the second equation, we obtain:\n\ny(u,v) = sin(π/2 + nπ) * sqrt(1 - 2v^2) = (C2/2) * (π/2 + nπ)\n\nSince sin(π/2 + nπ) = (-1)^n, we have:\n\ny(u,v) = (-1)^n * sqrt(1 - 2v^2) = (C2/2) * (π/2 + nπ)\n\nThus, the geodesics on the surface x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = 1 that start at the point (1,0,0) and make an angle of 45 degrees with the x-axis are given by:\n\nx(u, v) = 0\ny(u, v) = (-1)^n * sqrt(1 - 2v^2)\nz(u, v) = v"
