    "message_2": "To find the average temperature of the room over a 24-hour period, we need to integrate the sine function representing the temperature and then divide by the length of the interval (24 hours).\n\nThe sine function representing the temperature can be written as:\n\nT(t) = A * sin(B * t) + C\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the coefficient related to the period, t is the time in hours, and C is the average temperature of the room.\n\nGiven the amplitude A = 3 degrees Celsius and the period P = 12 hours, we can find the coefficient B using the formula:\n\nP = 2π/B\nB = 2π/P\n\nB = 2π/12 = π/6\n\nSo, the temperature function is:\n\nT(t) = 3 * sin(π/6 * t) + C\n\nTo find the average temperature C, we can integrate the function over one period (12 hours) and divide by the length of the interval (12 hours). Since the sine function is symmetric, the average value of the sine function over one period is 0. Therefore, the average temperature of the room is equal to C.\n\nNow, we need to find the average temperature over a 24-hour period. Since the period of the function is 12 hours, the temperature function will repeat itself over the next 12 hours. Therefore, the average temperature over a 24-hour period will be the same as the average temperature over a 12-hour period, which is C.\n\nSo, the average temperature of the room over a 24-hour period is C degrees Celsius."
