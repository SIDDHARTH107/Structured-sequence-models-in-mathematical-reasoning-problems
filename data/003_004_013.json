    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos(x) - 1 = 0 for 0 < x < 2π, first isolate the cosine function:\n\n2cos(x) = 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\ncos(x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the given interval (0 < x < 2π) for which the cosine function equals 1/2. Recall that the cosine function is positive in the first and fourth quadrants. The reference angle for which cos(x) = 1/2 is π/3 (or 60°).\n\nIn the first quadrant, the angle x is the same as the reference angle:\n\nx = π/3\n\nIn the fourth quadrant, the angle x is the difference between 2π and the reference angle:\n\nx = 2π - π/3 = 5π/3\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 2cos(x) - 1 = 0 in the interval 0 < x < 2π are:\n\nx = π/3 and x = 5π/3"
