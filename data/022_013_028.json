    "message_2": "To find the real and imaginary parts of f'(z), we first need to find the derivative of f(z) with respect to z. \n\nGiven f(z) = 2z^2 + 3iz + 4, let's find f'(z):\n\nf'(z) = d(2z^2)/dz + d(3iz)/dz + d(4)/dz\n\nf'(z) = 4z + 3i\n\nNow, let's find the real and imaginary parts of f'(z):\n\nThe real part of f'(z) is Re(f'(z)) = 4z, and the imaginary part of f'(z) is Im(f'(z)) = 3i.\n\nSo, the real and imaginary parts of f'(z) are 4z and 3i, respectively."
