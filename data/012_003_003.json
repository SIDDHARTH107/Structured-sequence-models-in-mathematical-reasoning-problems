    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices is a set of vertices in which no two vertices are adjacent. To find the maximum number of independent vertices, we can use a greedy algorithm to select vertices that are not adjacent to any previously selected vertex.\n\n1. Start with an empty set of independent vertices.\n2. Select the vertex with the smallest degree (number of edges connected to it) that is not adjacent to any vertex in the current independent set.\n3. Remove the selected vertex and its adjacent vertices from the graph.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until there are no more vertices left in the graph.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given adjacency matrix:\n\n1. The initial independent set is empty.\n2. The vertex with the smallest degree is vertex 1 (degree 2). Add it to the independent set.\n3. Remove vertex 1 and its adjacent vertices (vertices 2 and 5) from the graph.\n4. The remaining graph has the following adjacency matrix:\n\n   0  1  1  0  0  0\n   1  0  1  0  0  0\n   1  1  0  1  1  0\n   0  0  1  0  1  1\n   0  0  1  1  0  1\n   0  0  0  1  1  0\n\n5. The vertex with the smallest degree is vertex 4 (degree 2). Add it to the independent set.\n6. Remove vertex 4 and its adjacent vertices (vertices 3 and 6) from the graph.\n7. The remaining graph has the following adjacency matrix:\n\n   0  1  0\n   1  0  0\n   0  0  0\n\n8. The vertex with the smallest degree is vertex 7 (degree 0). Add it to the independent set.\n9. Remove vertex 7 from the graph.\n10. The remaining graph has the following adjacency matrix:\n\n   0  1\n   1  0\n\n11. The vertex with the smallest degree is vertex 2 (degree 1). Add it to the independent set.\n12. Remove vertex 2 and its adjacent vertex (vertex 3) from the graph.\n\nNow there are no more vertices left in the graph. The maximum independent set of vertices is {1, 4, 7, 2}, with a size of 4."
