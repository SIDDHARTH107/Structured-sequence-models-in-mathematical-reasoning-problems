    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 7^136 is divided by 5, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. First, let's find the pattern of remainders when powers of 7 are divided by 5.\n\n7^1 % 5 = 7 % 5 = 2\n7^2 % 5 = 49 % 5 = 4\n7^3 % 5 = 343 % 5 = 3\n7^4 % 5 = 2401 % 5 = 1\n\nNotice that after the 4th power, the remainder becomes 1. This means that the pattern will repeat after every 4 powers. So, we can find the remainder of 7^136 by finding the remainder of 136 when divided by 4.\n\n136 % 4 = 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, this means that 7^136 is a multiple of 7^4, and therefore, the remainder when 7^136 is divided by 5 will be the same as the remainder when 7^4 is divided by 5, which is 1.\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^136 is divided by 5 is 1."
