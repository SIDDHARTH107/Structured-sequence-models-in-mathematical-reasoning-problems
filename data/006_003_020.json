    "message_2": "There is only 1 King of Hearts in a standard deck of 52 cards. The probability of drawing the King of Hearts is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (drawing the King of Hearts) to the total number of possible outcomes (drawing any card from the deck).\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 1 / 52\n\nThe probability of drawing the King of Hearts from a standard deck of 52 cards is 1/52 or approximately 0.0192 or 1.92%."
