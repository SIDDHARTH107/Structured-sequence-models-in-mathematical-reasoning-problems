The cost of Project A is $50,000 and it has a 75% chance of generating a profit of $80,000 and a 25% chance of generating a profit of $30,000. The cost of Project B is $80,000 and it has a 60% chance of generating a profit of $100,000 and a 40% chance of generating a profit of $0. What is the better investment option for the company?",
    "message_2": "To determine the better investment option, we need to calculate the expected profit for each project. The expected profit is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the profit of that outcome and then summing the results.\n\nFor Project A:\nExpected profit = (0.75 * $80,000) + (0.25 * $30,000) = $60,000 + $7,500 = $67,500\nNet expected profit (subtracting the cost) = $67,500 - $50,000 = $17,500\n\nFor Project B:\nExpected profit = (0.60 * $100,000) + (0.40 * $0) = $60,000 + $0 = $60,000\nNet expected profit (subtracting the cost) = $60,000 - $80,000 = -$20,000\n\nBased on the net expected profit, Project A is the better investment option for the company, as it has a positive net expected profit of $17,500, while Project B has a negative net expected profit of -$20,000."
