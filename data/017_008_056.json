    "message_2": "To show that there does not exist a non-abelian group of order 8 other than the quaternion group Q8, the dihedral group D4, or the cyclic group C8, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 8 must have an element of order 2 or 4.\n2. If a group has more than one element of order 2, it must be non-abelian.\n\nLet G be a group of order 8. If G has an element of order 4, then G is either cyclic (isomorphic to C8) or a dihedral group (isomorphic to D4). If G has no element of order 4, then every non-identity element must have order 2.\n\nNow, let's assume G has no element of order 4 and show that G must be isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8. Since G has order 8, there must be 7 non-identity elements, all of which have order 2. Let a, b ∈ G be two distinct non-identity elements. Then, their product ab cannot be equal to a or b, since that would imply that either a or b is the identity element. Also, ab cannot be equal to the identity element, since that would imply a = b⁻¹, which contradicts the fact that a and b are distinct non-identity elements.\n\nTherefore, ab must be another non-identity element of order 2. Now, consider the element ba. If ba = ab, then G would be abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. So, ba ≠ ab. Since ba is also an element of order 2, and it is not equal to a, b, or ab, it must be another distinct non-identity element of order 2.\n\nNow, we have four distinct elements: e (the identity), a, b, and ab. Let's consider the product (ab)(ba). Since (ab)(ba) = a(ba)b, and a and b are both of order 2, we have:\n\n(ab)(ba) = a(ba)b = a(ba)(b⁻¹) = a(ba)(b) = a(ba)b = (ab)(ba).\n\nThis implies that (ab)(ba) = e, so (ba) = (ab)⁻¹. Therefore, the group G is generated by the elements a, b, and ab, and is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, there does not exist a non-abelian group of order 8 other than the quaternion group Q8, the dihedral group D4, or the cyclic group C8."
