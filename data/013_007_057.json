    "message_1": "A group of 10 farmers share a plot of land for grazing their animals. The plot of land can sustain up to 50 livestock animals. Each farmer wants to maximize their profits by allowing their animals to graze on the plot of land as much as possible. However, if the total number of animals on the plot of land exceeds 50, the land becomes overgrazed and results in the Tragedy of the Commons, reducing the farmers' profits. Each animal generates a profit of $100 per day for their respective farmer. However, for every animal over 50, the profit per animal gets reduced by $10 per day due to overgrazing.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of livestock animals that each farmer should allow to graze on the plot of land to ensure the maximum collective profits for the group of farmers?",
    "message_2": "To ensure maximum collective profits for the group of farmers without overgrazing, the total number of livestock animals should not exceed 50. Since there are 10 farmers, we can divide the 50 animals evenly among them.\n\n50 animals / 10 farmers = 5 animals per farmer\n\nEach farmer should allow a maximum of 5 livestock animals to graze on the plot of land to ensure the maximum collective profits for the group of farmers without causing overgrazing."
