    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral using the method of residues, we first need to find the residues of the function f(z) at its poles. The function has a pole of order 1 at z = -2 and a pole of order 3 at z = 3. Since the contour C encircles only the pole at z = -2, we only need to find the residue at this pole.\n\nLet's denote the function as f(z) = g(z) / h(z), where g(z) = z^2 - 1 and h(z) = (z + 2)(z - 3)^3. The pole at z = -2 is a simple pole, so we can find the residue using the formula:\n\nRes(f(z), -2) = lim (z -> -2) [(z + 2) * f(z)]\n\nNow, let's substitute f(z) with g(z) / h(z) and simplify:\n\nRes(f(z), -2) = lim (z -> -2) [(z + 2) * g(z) / h(z)]\n\nSince (z + 2) is a factor of h(z), we can cancel it out:\n\nRes(f(z), -2) = lim (z -> -2) [g(z) / (z - 3)^3]\n\nNow, let's substitute g(z) with z^2 - 1 and evaluate the limit:\n\nRes(f(z), -2) = lim (z -> -2) [(z^2 - 1) / (z - 3)^3]\n\nRes(f(z), -2) = [(-2)^2 - 1] / (-2 - 3)^3 = (4 - 1) / (-5)^3 = 3 / -125 = -3/125\n\nNow that we have the residue at z = -2, we can find the value of the integral using the residue theorem. The integral of f(z) along the contour C is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues inside C:\n\n∮[C] f(z) dz = 2πi * Res(f(z), -2) = 2πi * (-3/125)\n\n∮[C] f(z) dz = -6πi/125\n\nSo, the value of the integral is -6πi/125."
