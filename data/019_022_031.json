    "message_1": "A math student needs to make a decision on which university to attend. The student has two options - University A and University B. The probability of getting a job after graduating from University A is 0.7, and the probability of getting a job after graduating from University B is 0.85. The cost of attending University A is $20,000, and the cost of attending University B is $25,000. Assuming the only factor for the student's decision is getting a job after graduation, which university should the student attend according to the expected value criterion?",
    "message_2": "To determine which university the student should attend according to the expected value criterion, we need to calculate the expected value for each university. The expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of an outcome by the value of that outcome. In this case, the outcome is getting a job after graduation, and the value is the cost of attending the university.\n\nExpected Value for University A:\nProbability of getting a job: 0.7\nCost of attending: $20,000\nExpected Value (EV) = Probability * Cost\nEV_A = 0.7 * 20,000 = 14,000\n\nExpected Value for University B:\nProbability of getting a job: 0.85\nCost of attending: $25,000\nExpected Value (EV) = Probability * Cost\nEV_B = 0.85 * 25,000 = 21,250\n\nNow, we compare the expected values for both universities. The higher expected value indicates a better option for the student.\n\nEV_A = 14,000\nEV_B = 21,250\n\nSince the expected value for University B (21,250) is higher than the expected value for University A (14,000), the student should attend University B according to the expected value criterion."
