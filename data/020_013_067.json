    "message_1": "A packaging company produces two types of boxes, type A and type B. Each type A box requires 2 units of material A and 1 unit of material B while each type B box requires 1 unit of material A and 3 units of material B. The company has 240 units of material A and 180 units of material B available. The profit for each type A box sold is $8 and for each type B box sold it is $10. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can achieve by producing a combination of type A and type B boxes?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A boxes and y be the number of type B boxes.\n\nThe constraints for the materials are:\n2x + y ≤ 240 (Material A constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 180 (Material B constraint)\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 8x + 10y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Solve the Material A constraint for y:\ny ≤ -2x + 240\n\n2. Solve the Material B constraint for y:\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 60\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect. We can find these vertices by solving the system of equations:\n\nIntersection of Material A and Material B constraints:\n2x + y = 240\nx + 3y = 180\n\nSolve the system of equations:\nx = 240 - 2y\n(240 - 2y) + 3y = 180\ny = 60\n\nSubstitute y back into the equation for x:\nx = 240 - 2(60)\nx = 120\n\nSo, the intersection point is (120, 60).\n\nIntersection of Material A constraint and y-axis (x=0):\n2x + y = 240\ny = 240\n\nIntersection of Material B constraint and x-axis (y=0):\nx + 3y = 180\nx = 180\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are (0, 240), (180, 0), and (120, 60).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 240) = 8(0) + 10(240) = 2400\nP(180, 0) = 8(180) + 10(0) = 1440\nP(120, 60) = 8(120) + 10(60) = 1680\n\nThe maximum profit is $2400 when producing 0 type A boxes and 240 type B boxes."
