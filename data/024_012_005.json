    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator of the given 2-form ω, we first need to recall the definition of the Hodge star operator. For a k-form α on an n-dimensional manifold M with metric g, the Hodge star operator is defined as:\n\n*(α) = (α ∧ *1) / ||α||^2\n\nwhere *1 is the volume form on M, and ||α||^2 is the square of the norm of α with respect to the metric g.\n\nIn our case, M is a 3-dimensional manifold with metric g = dx1^2 + dx2^2 + dx3^2. The volume form *1 on M is given by:\n\n*1 = dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3\n\nNow, we need to compute the square of the norm of ω with respect to the metric g. The norm of a 2-form is given by:\n\n||ω||^2 = g(ω, ω)\n\nwhere g(ω, ω) is the inner product of ω with itself with respect to the metric g. In our case, ω = dx1 ∧ dx2 + 2dx2 ∧ dx3. We can compute the inner product as follows:\n\ng(ω, ω) = (1)(1) + (2)(2) = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, ||ω||^2 = 5.\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge star operator of ω:\n\n*(ω) = (ω ∧ *1) / ||ω||^2\n     = ((dx1 ∧ dx2 + 2dx2 ∧ dx3) ∧ (dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3)) / 5\n\nTo compute the wedge product, we can use the antisymmetry property of the wedge product:\n\ndx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx1 = 0 (since dx1 ∧ dx1 = 0)\ndx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx2 = 0 (since dx2 ∧ dx2 = 0)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n*(ω) = (dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3 + 2(dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx1)) / 5\n\nNow, we can use the cyclic property of the wedge product:\n\ndx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx1 = - dx2 ∧ dx1 ∧ dx3\n\nSo, we get:\n\n*(ω) = (dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3 - 2dx2 ∧ dx1 ∧ dx3) / 5\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term dx1 ∧ dx3:\n\n*(ω) = (dx1 ∧ dx3) ∧ (dx2 - 2dx1) / 5\n\nThus, the Hodge star operator of the 2-form ω on M is:\n\n*(ω) = (1/5)(dx1 ∧ dx3) ∧ (dx2 - 2dx1)"
