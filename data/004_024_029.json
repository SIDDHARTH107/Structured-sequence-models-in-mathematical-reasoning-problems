    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nStarting with the left side of the equation:\n\nd/dx(x^2) + d/dx(2xy) + d/dx(y^2) = d/dx(25)\n\nThe derivative of x^2 with respect to x is 2x. For the 2xy term, we need to use the product rule:\n\nd/dx(2xy) = 2x(dy/dx) + 2y\n\nThe derivative of y^2 with respect to x is 2y(dy/dx), since we're differentiating with respect to x. The derivative of 25 with respect to x is 0.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n2x + 2x(dy/dx) + 2y + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nWe want to find dy/dx at the point (3,4). Substitute x = 3 and y = 4 into the equation:\n\n2(3) + 2(3)(dy/dx) + 2(4) + 2(4)(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n6 + 6(dy/dx) + 8 + 8(dy/dx) = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n14 + 14(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n\n14(dy/dx) = -14\n\n(dy/dx) = -14/14\n\n(dy/dx) = -1\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at the point (3,4) is -1."
