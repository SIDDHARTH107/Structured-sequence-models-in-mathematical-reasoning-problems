    "message_2": "To find the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood on a given night, we first need to determine the average number of burglaries per night. \n\nSince there are on average 5 burglaries per month, we can assume there are 5 burglaries in 30 days (assuming an average month has 30 days). \n\nNow, we can find the average number of burglaries per night by dividing the total number of burglaries in a month (5) by the number of days in a month (30).\n\nAverage burglaries per night = 5 burglaries / 30 days = 1/6 burglaries per night\n\nThe probability of a burglary occurring on a given night can be represented as a fraction of the average number of burglaries per night (1/6) over the total number of possible outcomes (1, since there's only one night we're considering).\n\nProbability of a burglary on a given night = (1/6) / 1 = 1/6\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood on a given night is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667, which is about 16.67%."
