    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find the union of (A ∆ B) and B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ B = {1, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the union of A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∪ B) and B:\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∆ {2, 3, 4} = {1}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of the two sets we found earlier:\n\n((A ∆ B) ∪ B) ∆ ((A ∪ B) ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∆ {1} = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow we need to prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over union. To do this, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ C = (A ∪ C) ∆ (B ∪ C)\n\nLet's break down the left side of the equation:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ C = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) ∪ C\n\nNow let's break down the right side of the equation:\n\n(A ∪ C) ∆ (B ∪ C) = ((A ∪ C) ∪ (B ∪ C)) - ((A ∪ C) ∩ (B ∪ C))\n\nUsing the distributive property of union over intersection, we can rewrite the right side as:\n\n= ((A ∪ B) ∪ C) - ((A ∩ B) ∪ C)\n\nNow we can see that the left side and the right side of the equation are equal:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ C = (A ∪ C) ∆ (B ∪ C)\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference is distributive over union."
