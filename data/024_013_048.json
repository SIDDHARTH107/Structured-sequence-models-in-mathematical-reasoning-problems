    "message_2": "To find the volume form, we first need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor g. The volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of g, multiplied by the standard volume form in 3 dimensions, which is dx ∧ dy ∧ dz.\n\nThe determinant of g is:\n\ndet(g) = |g| = 4(9*1 - 0*0) - 1(1*1 - 2*0) + 2(1*0 - 9*2)\n       = 4(9) - 1(1) + 2(-18)\n       = 36 - 1 - 36\n       = -1\n\nNow, we take the square root of the absolute value of the determinant:\n\n√|det(g)| = √|-1| = √1 = 1\n\nThe volume form is then given by:\n\nω = (√|det(g)|) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = 1 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nSo, the volume form is simply:\n\nω = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz"
