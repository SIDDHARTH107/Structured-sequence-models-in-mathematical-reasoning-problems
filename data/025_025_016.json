Define the operators L_u and L_v on M by L_u(v) = 0, L_u(u) = v, L_v(v) = 0, L_v(u) = 3u. Find the Jordan form of each of the operators L_u and L_v.",
    "message_2": "To find the Jordan form of the operators L_u and L_v, we first need to find their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let's start with L_u.\n\nFor L_u, we have the following system of equations for the eigenvectors:\n\nL_u(u) = λu\nL_u(v) = λv\n\nFrom the given definitions of L_u, we have:\n\nL_u(u) = v\nL_u(v) = 0\n\nComparing these equations with the eigenvalue equations, we get:\n\nv = λu\n0 = λv\n\nSince λv = 0, either λ = 0 or v = 0. If λ = 0, then v = 0, which is a trivial solution. If v = 0, then u is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ = 0. Thus, the only eigenvalue for L_u is 0, and the corresponding eigenvector is u.\n\nNow let's find the Jordan form of L_u. Since there is only one eigenvalue (0), the Jordan form will have 0's on the diagonal. The matrix representation of L_u with respect to the basis {u, v} is:\n\nL_u = | 0  0 |\n      | 1  0 |\n\nThe Jordan form of L_u is the same as its matrix representation:\n\nJ_u = | 0  0 |\n      | 1  0 |\n\nNow let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for L_v.\n\nFor L_v, we have the following system of equations for the eigenvectors:\n\nL_v(u) = λu\nL_v(v) = λv\n\nFrom the given definitions of L_v, we have:\n\nL_v(u) = 3u\nL_v(v) = 0\n\nComparing these equations with the eigenvalue equations, we get:\n\n3u = λu\n0 = λv\n\nSince 0 = λv, either λ = 0 or v = 0. If λ = 0, then v = 0, which is a trivial solution. If v = 0, then λ = 3, and u is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ = 3. Thus, the only eigenvalue for L_v is 3, and the corresponding eigenvector is u.\n\nNow let's find the Jordan form of L_v. Since there is only one eigenvalue (3), the Jordan form will have 3's on the diagonal. The matrix representation of L_v with respect to the basis {u, v} is:\n\nL_v = | 3  0 |\n      | 0  0 |\n\nThe Jordan form of L_v is the same as its matrix representation:\n\nJ_v = | 3  0 |\n      | 0  0 |\n\nIn conclusion, the Jordan forms of the operators L_u and L_v are:\n\nJ_u = | 0  0 |\n      | 1  0 |\n\nJ_v = | 3  0 |\n      | 0  0 |"
