    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 4x^2 + 2x - 1 in the interval [-2, 3], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 8x + 2\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n4x^3 - 12x^2 + 8x + 2 = 0\n\nThis cubic equation is difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods to find the approximate critical points. Using a numerical solver, we find that there are two critical points in the interval [-2, 3]:\n\nx ≈ 0.317 and x ≈ 2.683\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) ≈ 25\nf(0.317) ≈ 0.439\nf(2.683) ≈ -0.439\nf(3) ≈ 1\n\nThe maximum value of the function in the interval [-2, 3] is approximately 25, which occurs at x = -2."
