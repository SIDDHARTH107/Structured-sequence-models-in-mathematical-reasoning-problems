    "message_1": "Suppose that on any given day, the probability of a customer buying Product A is 0.4 and the probability of a customer buying Product B is 0.2. What is the probability that out of seven customers, exactly four will buy Product A and the remaining three will buy Product B?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, customers buying Product A) in n trials (customers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (buying Product A)\n- n is the number of trials (customers)\n- k is the number of successes (customers buying Product A)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of exactly 4 customers buying Product A out of 7:\n\nn = 7 (total number of customers)\nk = 4 (number of customers buying Product A)\np = 0.4 (probability of a customer buying Product A)\n\nP(X = 4) = C(7, 4) * 0.4^4 * (1-0.4)^(7-4)\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of exactly 3 customers buying Product B out of the remaining 3:\n\nn = 3 (total number of remaining customers)\nk = 3 (number of customers buying Product B)\np = 0.2 (probability of a customer buying Product B)\n\nP(X = 3) = C(3, 3) * 0.2^3 * (1-0.2)^(3-3)\n\nNow, we need to multiply these two probabilities to find the probability of both events happening:\n\nP(4 customers buy A and 3 customers buy B) = P(X = 4) * P(X = 3)\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7-4)!) = 35\nC(3, 3) = 3! / (3! * (3-3)!) = 1\n\nP(X = 4) = 35 * 0.4^4 * 0.6^3 ≈ 0.290304\nP(X = 3) = 1 * 0.2^3 * 0.8^0 = 0.008\n\nP(4 customers buy A and 3 customers buy B) = 0.290304 * 0.008 ≈ 0.002322\n\nSo, the probability that out of seven customers, exactly four will buy Product A and the remaining three will buy Product B is approximately 0.002322 or 0.2322%."
