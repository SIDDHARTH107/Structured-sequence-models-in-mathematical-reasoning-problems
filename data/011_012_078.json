    "message_1": "Suppose that a school has 80 students who play either basketball, volleyball or both. Of these students, 50 play basketball and 45 play volleyball. How many students play both basketball and volleyball? (Use the Inclusion-Exclusion principle to solve the problem)",
    "message_2": "Let A be the set of students who play basketball, and B be the set of students who play volleyball. We are given that |A| = 50, |B| = 45, and |A ∪ B| = 80.\n\nUsing the Inclusion-Exclusion principle, we have:\n\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|\n\nWe want to find the number of students who play both basketball and volleyball, which is represented by |A ∩ B|. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n80 = 50 + 45 - |A ∩ B|\n\nNow, we can solve for |A ∩ B|:\n\n80 - 95 = -15\n\nSo, |A ∩ B| = -(-15) = 15\n\nTherefore, 15 students play both basketball and volleyball."
