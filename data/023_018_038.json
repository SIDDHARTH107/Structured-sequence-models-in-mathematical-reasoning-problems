    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input, we first need to find the frequency response of the system. The frequency response is obtained by substituting s = jω in the transfer function G(s), where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe sinusoidal input has a frequency of 2 Hz, so the angular frequency ω = 2π × 2 = 4π rad/s.\n\nNow, let's substitute s = jω in the transfer function:\n\nG(jω) = (jω + 2) / (ω^2 + 4jω + 5)\n\nFor ω = 4π:\n\nG(j4π) = (j4π + 2) / ((4π)^2 + 4j(4π) + 5)\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnitude and phase of G(j4π):\n\n|G(j4π)| = sqrt( (Re(G(j4π)))^2 + (Im(G(j4π)))^2 )\n∠G(j4π) = arctan( Im(G(j4π)) / Re(G(j4π)) )\n\nThe steady-state response y(t) to a sinusoidal input x(t) = 3sin(2πft) can be expressed as:\n\ny(t) = |G(jω)| * amplitude * sin(2πft + ∠G(jω))\n\nwhere amplitude = 3 and f = 2 Hz.\n\nNow, we need to calculate |G(j4π)| and ∠G(j4π):\n\n|G(j4π)| ≈ 0.1087\n∠G(j4π) ≈ -1.325 rad\n\nFinally, the steady-state response y(t) is:\n\ny(t) ≈ 0.1087 * 3 * sin(2π(2)t - 1.325)\n\ny(t) ≈ 0.3261 * sin(4πt - 1.325)"
