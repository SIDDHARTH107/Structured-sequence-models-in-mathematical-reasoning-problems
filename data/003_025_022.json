    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the plane's velocity vector, we can break down the velocity into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components using trigonometry. \n\nGiven:\nSpeed = 400 km/h\nHeading = 30 degrees\n\nWe can use the sine and cosine functions to find the x and y components of the velocity vector.\n\nx-component (horizontal) = Speed * cos(Heading)\ny-component (vertical) = Speed * sin(Heading)\n\nx-component = 400 * cos(30°)\ny-component = 400 * sin(30°)\n\nNote that 30 degrees is equal to π/6 radians. \n\nx-component = 400 * cos(π/6)\ny-component = 400 * sin(π/6)\n\nx-component ≈ 400 * 0.866\ny-component ≈ 400 * 0.5\n\nx-component ≈ 346.41 km/h\ny-component ≈ 200 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the velocity vector using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nMagnitude = √(x-component² + y-component²)\n\nMagnitude = √(346.41² + 200²)\nMagnitude = √(120000 + 60000)\nMagnitude = √(180000)\nMagnitude = 424.26 km/h\n\nTo find the direction of the velocity vector, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nDirection = arctan(y-component / x-component)\n\nDirection = arctan(200 / 346.41)\n\nDirection ≈ 30 degrees (since the plane is flying at a heading of 30 degrees)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the plane's velocity vector is approximately 424.26 km/h, and its direction is 30 degrees."
