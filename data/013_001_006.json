    "message_1": "In a Prisoner's Dilemma game, two players, A and B, each have to choose between cooperating with the other player or defecting. If both players cooperate, they both win 3 points. If both players defect, they both win 1 point. If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector wins 5 points and the cooperator loses 5 points. \n\nIf Player A cooperates, what should Player B do to maximize their total points, assuming rationality and self-interest?",
    "message_2": "If Player A cooperates, Player B has two options: cooperate or defect.\n\n1. If Player B cooperates, both players win 3 points.\n2. If Player B defects, Player B wins 5 points, and Player A loses 5 points.\n\nAssuming rationality and self-interest, Player B should choose to defect in order to maximize their total points, as they would win 5 points instead of 3 points if they cooperated."
