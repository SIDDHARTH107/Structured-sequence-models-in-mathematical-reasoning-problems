    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval of the population mean, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96)\nσ = standard deviation\nn = sample size\n\nGiven the information in the problem, we have:\n\nx̄ = 75\nσ = 10\nn = 50\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 75 ± (1.96 * (10 / √50))\n\nFirst, calculate the square root of the sample size:\n\n√50 ≈ 7.071\n\nNow, divide the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size:\n\n10 / 7.071 ≈ 1.414\n\nNext, multiply the Z-score by the result:\n\n1.96 * 1.414 ≈ 2.772\n\nFinally, add and subtract this value from the sample mean to find the confidence interval:\n\nLower limit: 75 - 2.772 ≈ 72.228\nUpper limit: 75 + 2.772 ≈ 77.772\n\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval of the population mean is approximately (72.228, 77.772)."
