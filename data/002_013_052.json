    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base length of 8cm and a base width of 5cm. The pyramid also has a height of 12cm. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid is the product of its length and width:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width = 8cm * 5cm = 40 square centimeters\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 40cm² * 12cm = (40/3) * 12cm³ = 160cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
