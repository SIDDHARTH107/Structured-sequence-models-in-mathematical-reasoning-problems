    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular polygon, you simply multiply the number of sides by the length of each side. In this case, the polygon has 8 sides and each side measures 6 cm.\n\nPerimeter = (Number of sides) × (Length of each side)\nPerimeter = 8 × 6 cm\nPerimeter = 48 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular polygon is 48 cm."
