    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. A maximum independent set is an independent set with the largest possible number of vertices.\n\nIn the given graph G, one possible maximum independent set is {A, E, F}. No two vertices in this set are adjacent, and it is not possible to add any more vertices to the set without violating the independence condition.\n\nThe cardinality of this maximum independent set is 3, as there are three vertices in the set {A, E, F}."
