    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference S and the Cartesian product T.\n\nThe symmetric difference S of sets A and B is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In this case, S = {1, 4}.\n\nThe Cartesian product T of sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. In this case, T = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of pairs in T that are NOT in S. Since S contains single elements and T contains ordered pairs, there is no direct overlap between the two sets. Therefore, the question is asking for the total number of pairs in T, which is 9."
