    "message_2": "Let C be a rational curve in the projective plane of degree d=5. We want to find the number of points on C that lie on a line L in the projective plane.\n\nBy Bézout's theorem, the number of intersection points between a curve of degree m and a curve of degree n in the projective plane is equal to m * n, counted with multiplicity. In our case, the curve C has degree 5, and the line L has degree 1.\n\nTherefore, by Bézout's theorem, the number of intersection points between C and L is 5 * 1 = 5, counted with multiplicity. This means that there are 5 points on C that lie on the line L in the projective plane."
