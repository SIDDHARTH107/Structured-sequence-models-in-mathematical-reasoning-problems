    "message_2": "The closure of a set A in a topological space is the smallest closed set containing A. In the case of the real numbers with the usual topology, the closure of a set includes all its limit points.\n\nThe set A = {1/n | n ∈ N} consists of the reciprocals of all natural numbers. To find the closure of A, we need to determine its limit points.\n\nA limit point x of A is a point such that every open neighborhood of x contains at least one point from A other than x itself. In this case, the limit point is 0, as for any open neighborhood around 0, we can find a reciprocal of a natural number within that neighborhood.\n\nTherefore, the closure of the set A is the union of A and its limit point, which is:\n\nClosure(A) = A ∪ {0} = {0, 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...}"
