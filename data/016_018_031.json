    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set (also known as Cantor dust) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set, at each step, we remove the middle third of each line segment, leaving 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2). The scaling factor is 3, as each remaining line segment is 1/3 the length of the original (r = 3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309"
