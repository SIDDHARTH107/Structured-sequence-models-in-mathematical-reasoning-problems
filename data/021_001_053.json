    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix corresponding to the given system.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write down the augmented matrix.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n|  3  1  2 |  5 |\n|  2 -3  1 | -2 |\n|  1  2 -4 |  0 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, we'll swap Row 1 and Row 3 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n|  1  2 -4 |  0 |\n|  2 -3  1 | -2 |\n|  3  1  2 |  5 |\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column below the 1. To do this, we'll perform the following row operations:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\nThis results in:\n\n|  1  2 -4 |  0  |\n|  0 -7  9 | -2  |\n|  0 -5 14 |  5  |\n\nNow, we'll eliminate the -5 in the second column below the -7. To do this, we'll perform the following row operation:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - (5/7) * Row 2\n\nThis results in:\n\n|  1  2 -4 |  0  |\n|  0 -7  9 | -2  |\n|  0  0  1 |  1  |\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the last row, we have:\n\nz = 1\n\nNow, we'll substitute this value into the second row to find y:\n\n-7y + 9z = -2\n-7y + 9(1) = -2\n-7y = -11\ny = 11/7\n\nFinally, we'll substitute the values of y and z into the first row to find x:\n\nx + 2y - 4z = 0\nx + 2(11/7) - 4(1) = 0\nx = 4 - 22/7\nx = (14 - 22)/7\nx = -8/7\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -8/7\ny = 11/7\nz = 1"
