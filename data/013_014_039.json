The bidders are privately informed of their own reservation prices, which are distributed uniformly on the interval [0, 100]. Design a mechanism to sell the object to the highest bidder in terms of expected revenue.\n\nWhat is the expected revenue generated by your mechanism, assuming that both bidders bid truthfully?",
    "message_2": "To design a mechanism that maximizes expected revenue, we can use the well-known Vickrey auction (also known as the second-price sealed-bid auction). In this auction, both bidders submit their bids privately, and the highest bidder wins the object but pays the second-highest bid.\n\nSince the reservation prices are distributed uniformly on the interval [0, 100], the probability density function (pdf) for each bidder's reservation price is:\n\nf(x) = 1/100, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 100\n\nNow, let's find the expected revenue generated by the Vickrey auction, assuming that both bidders bid truthfully. Let X and Y be the reservation prices of bidder 1 and bidder 2, respectively. The expected revenue, E[R], can be calculated as follows:\n\nE[R] = E[min(X, Y)]\n\nTo find the expected value of the minimum of X and Y, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the minimum of two uniform random variables:\n\nF_min(x) = 1 - (1 - F(x))^2\n\nSince the CDF of a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 100] is F(x) = x/100, we have:\n\nF_min(x) = 1 - (1 - x/100)^2\n\nNow, we can find the pdf of the minimum of X and Y by differentiating F_min(x) with respect to x:\n\nf_min(x) = d(F_min(x))/dx = 2 * (1 - x/100) * (-1/100)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the expected revenue by integrating the product of x and f_min(x) over the interval [0, 100]:\n\nE[R] = ∫(x * f_min(x) dx) from 0 to 100\nE[R] = ∫(x * 2 * (1 - x/100) * (-1/100) dx) from 0 to 100\nE[R] = (-1/50) * ∫(x * (200 - 2x) dx) from 0 to 100\nE[R] = (-1/50) * [100x^2 - (2/3)x^3] from 0 to 100\nE[R] = (-1/50) * (100 * 100^2 - (2/3) * 100^3) = 100/3\n\nThus, the expected revenue generated by the Vickrey auction, assuming that both bidders bid truthfully, is $100/3 ≈ $33.33."
