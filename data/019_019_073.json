    "message_2": "According to the Church-Turing thesis, a function is computable if and only if it can be computed by a Turing machine. The decimal expansion of pi is a well-defined mathematical function, and there are algorithms that can compute its digits, such as the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe (BBP) formula and the Chudnovsky algorithm.\n\nSince these algorithms can be implemented on a Turing machine, the decimal expansion of pi can indeed be computed by a Turing machine. This is in accordance with the Church-Turing thesis, which states that any effectively calculable function can be computed by a Turing machine."
