    "message_1": "Alright! Here is a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\n\"An investment firm has a portfolio consisting of 5 different stocks. The firm wants to maximize their return with a constraint that they cannot invest more than 30% of their total budget in any one stock. Using tabu search optimization, what is the optimal allocation of the firm's budget to each stock?\"",
    "message_2": "As a language model AI, I cannot perform tabu search optimization directly. However, I can guide you through the steps to perform it yourself. Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that can be used to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.\n\nHere's a general outline of the tabu search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a solution (in this case, an allocation of the budget to the 5 stocks).\n2. Define a neighborhood function that generates a set of neighboring solutions.\n3. Choose the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list.\n4. Update the tabu list by adding the chosen solution and removing the oldest one.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nTo apply this algorithm to your problem, you'll need to define the objective function (maximizing return), the neighborhood function (generating new allocations), and the constraints (not investing more than 30% in any stock).\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n1. Initialize a solution: Allocate the budget evenly among the 5 stocks (20% each).\n2. Define a neighborhood function: Generate new allocations by moving a small percentage (e.g., 1%) of the budget from one stock to another, ensuring that no stock has more than 30% of the budget.\n3. Calculate the return for each allocation in the neighborhood.\n4. Choose the allocation with the highest return that is not in the tabu list.\n5. Update the tabu list.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nNote that you'll need historical data or some other method to estimate the returns for each stock. Also, the quality of the solution will depend on the number of iterations, the size of the neighborhood, and the length of the tabu list. You may need to experiment with these parameters to find a good solution.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that this algorithm provides an approximate solution, and there's no guarantee that it will find the true optimal allocation."
