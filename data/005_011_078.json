    "message_1": "A researcher wants to study the effect of three different types of fertilizers on the growth of tomato plants. She decides to set up a completely randomized design where the three types of fertilizers are randomly assigned to 12 tomato plants, with 4 plants receiving each type of fertilizer. After 8 weeks of growth, the heights of the tomato plants (in centimeters) are measured. The mean height of plants that received Fertilizer A is 30 cm with a standard deviation of 2 cm, the mean height of plants that received Fertilizer B is 32 cm with a standard deviation of 3 cm, and the mean height of plants that received Fertilizer C is 28 cm with a standard deviation of 1.5 cm. Can the researcher conclude that there is a significant difference in mean plant height among the three types of fertilizers? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in mean plant height among the three types of fertilizers, we can perform a one-way ANOVA test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference in mean plant height among the three fertilizers, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant difference in mean plant height among the three fertilizers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the overall mean height (Grand Mean) of all the plants:\n\nGrand Mean = (Sum of all heights) / (Total number of plants)\n= (4 * 30 + 4 * 32 + 4 * 28) / 12\n= (120 + 128 + 112) / 12\n= 360 / 12\n= 30 cm\n\nNow, we need to calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB), Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW), and the total Sum of Squares (SST).\n\nSSB = Σn_i * (mean_i - Grand Mean)^2\n= 4 * (30 - 30)^2 + 4 * (32 - 30)^2 + 4 * (28 - 30)^2\n= 4 * (0) + 4 * (2)^2 + 4 * (-2)^2\n= 0 + 16 + 16\n= 32\n\nSSW = Σ(n_i - 1) * s_i^2\n= (4 - 1) * 2^2 + (4 - 1) * 3^2 + (4 - 1) * 1.5^2\n= 3 * 4 + 3 * 9 + 3 * 2.25\n= 12 + 27 + 6.75\n= 45.75\n\nSST = SSB + SSW\n= 32 + 45.75\n= 77.75\n\nNow, we need to calculate the Mean Squares Between Groups (MSB) and Mean Squares Within Groups (MSW).\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1)\n= 32 / (3 - 1)\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nMSW = SSW / (N - k)\n= 45.75 / (12 - 3)\n= 45.75 / 9\n= 5.083\n\nNow, we can calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW\n= 16 / 5.083\n= 3.146\n\nNow, we need to compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table. The degrees of freedom for the numerator (df1) is k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2, and the degrees of freedom for the denominator (df2) is N - k = 12 - 3 = 9. Using a significance level of 0.05, we find the critical value from the F-distribution table to be F(2, 9) = 4.256.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (3.146) is less than the critical value (4.256), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the researcher cannot conclude that there is a significant difference in mean plant height among the three types of fertilizers at a significance level of 0.05."
