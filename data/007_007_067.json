    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 15x + 21y = 48, we first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 21.\n\nThe GCD(15, 21) = 3.\n\nSince the GCD(15, 21) divides 48, there are solutions to this Diophantine equation.\n\nNow, we divide the equation by the GCD:\n\n(15x + 21y) / 3 = 48 / 3\n\n5x + 7y = 16\n\nWe will now use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution:\n\n5(-2) + 7(1) = -10 + 7 = -3\n\nNow, we multiply this particular solution by -16/-3 to get a solution to 5x + 7y = 16:\n\nx = -2 * (-16/-3) = 32/3\ny = 1 * (-16/-3) = 16/3\n\nSince x and y must be integers, we will find the general solution by adding multiples of 7 to x and subtracting the same multiples of 5 from y:\n\nx = 32/3 + 7t\ny = 16/3 - 5t\n\nNow, we will find the values of t for which x and y are positive integers:\n\nt = 0: x = 32/3, y = 16/3 (not integers)\nt = 1: x = 32/3 + 7 = 53/3, y = 16/3 - 5 = 1/3 (not integers)\nt = 2: x = 32/3 + 14 = 74/3, y = 16/3 - 10 = -14/3 (y is not positive)\n\nThere are no positive integer solutions for x and y for the given Diophantine equation 15x + 21y = 48."
