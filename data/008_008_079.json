    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The production of each unit of A requires 2 units of resource X and 3 units of resource Y. The production of each unit of B requires 4 units of resource X and 1 unit of resource Y. If the company has 60 units of resource X and 45 units of resource Y available, how many units of A and B should they produce to maximize profit? The profit from each unit of A is $10 and from each unit of B is $15.",

Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 60 (Resource X constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 45 (Resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 60\n   Divide by 2: x + 2y ≤ 30\n   y ≤ -0.5x + 30\n\n2. 3x + y ≤ 45\n   y ≤ -3x + 45\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. We'll find these intersection points:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\n\n-0.5x + 30 = -3x + 45\n2.5x = 15\nx = 6\n\nSubstitute x back into either equation to find y:\n\ny = -0.5(6) + 30\ny = 27\n\nSo, the intersection point is (6, 27).\n\nIntersection of (1) and x-axis (y = 0):\n\nx + 2(0) ≤ 30\nx ≤ 30\n\nIntersection of (2) and y-axis (x = 0):\n\n3(0) + y ≤ 45\ny ≤ 45\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 45), (6, 27), and (30, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 45) = 10(0) + 15(45) = $675\nP(6, 27) = 10(6) + 15(27) = $60 + $405 = $465\nP(30, 0) = 10(30) + 15(0) = $300\n\nThe maximum profit is $675, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 45 units of product B."
