    "message_2": "The Hopf map, denoted by $h:M\\to S^2$, is a mapping from the 3-dimensional sphere $M$ (also known as $S^3$) to the 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$. The Hopf map can be defined using quaternions or complex numbers. Here, we will use complex numbers to define the Hopf map.\n\nLet $z_1 = x + iy$ and $z_2 = z + iw$ be two complex numbers, where $x, y, z, w$ are real numbers. The equation of the 3-dimensional sphere $M$ can be written in terms of these complex numbers as:\n\n$|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$\n\nNow, we can define the Hopf map $h:M\\to S^2$ as follows:\n\n$h(z_1, z_2) = \\left(\\frac{2z_1\\overline{z_2}}{1 + |z_2|^2}, \\frac{|z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2}{1 + |z_2|^2}\\right)$\n\nHere, $\\overline{z_2}$ denotes the complex conjugate of $z_2$. The Hopf map maps points on the 3-dimensional sphere $M$ to points on the 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$. The Hopf map is a continuous map and has the interesting property of being a fibration, meaning that the inverse image of a point on $S^2$ is a circle (a 1-dimensional sphere) on $M$."
