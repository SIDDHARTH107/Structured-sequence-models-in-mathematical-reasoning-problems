    "message_2": "First, we'll solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the second equation for x:\n\nx - y = 2\nx = y + 2\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n2(y + 2) + 3y = 14\n\nNow, we'll solve for y:\n\n2y + 4 + 3y = 14\n5y + 4 = 14\n5y = 10\ny = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression for x:\n\nx = y + 2\nx = 2 + 2\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4 and y = 2."
