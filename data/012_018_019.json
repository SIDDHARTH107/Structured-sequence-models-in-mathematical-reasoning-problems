    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. To determine the edge connectivity, we can use Menger's theorem, which states that the edge connectivity is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact edge connectivity. The edge connectivity can range from 1 (if there is a vertex with only one edge) to 9 (if the graph is a complete graph with all vertices having 9 edges). \n\nTo find the edge connectivity, we would need more information about the graph's structure, such as the degree of each vertex or the adjacency matrix."
