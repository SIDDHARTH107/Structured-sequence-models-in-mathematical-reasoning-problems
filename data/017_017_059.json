Then, the prime factorization of 100 is 2^2 * 5^2.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, we know that:\n\n1. There exists a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 2^2 = 4 and a Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5^2 = 25 in G.\n2. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides the index [G:P] = 25, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 5.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides the index [G:Q] = 4, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). So, n_5 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases for n_2 and n_5:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup Q. Since they are unique, they are both normal in G. The order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 4 * 25 / 1 = 100. So, G is isomorphic to the direct product P x Q, which is an abelian group. However, this group does exist, so we need to consider other cases.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. Let P_1 and P_2 be distinct Sylow 2-subgroups. Then, |P_1 ∩ P_2| = 1 or 2. If |P_1 ∩ P_2| = 2, then P_1 = P_2, which is a contradiction. So, |P_1 ∩ P_2| = 1. \n\nNow, let x ∈ P_1 and y ∈ Q. Then, xyx^(-1)y^(-1) ∈ P_1 ∩ Q, since Q is normal in G. But P_1 ∩ Q = {e}, so xyx^(-1)y^(-1) = e, and xy = yx. Thus, G is an abelian group. However, this group also exists, so we need to consider the last case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G, and 4 Sylow 5-subgroups. However, this group also exists.\n\nSince we have considered all possible cases for n_2 and n_5, we can conclude that there does exist a group of order 100. The original statement is incorrect."
