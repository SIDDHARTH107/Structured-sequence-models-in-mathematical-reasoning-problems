    "message_2": "To determine the number of fixed points of the automorphism σ of order 3 on X, we can use the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The formula relates the genera of two curves connected by a finite morphism and the ramification points of the morphism.\n\nLet Y be a smooth projective curve such that there is a finite morphism π: X → Y with π(σ(x)) = π(x) for all x in X. Then σ induces an automorphism on the function field of X, and the fixed field of this automorphism is the function field of Y.\n\nThe Riemann-Hurwitz formula is given by:\n\n2g(X) - 2 = deg(π) * (2g(Y) - 2) + Σ(e_i - 1),\n\nwhere g(X) and g(Y) are the genera of X and Y, respectively, deg(π) is the degree of the morphism π, and e_i are the ramification indices of the morphism at the points x_i in X.\n\nSince σ has order 3, deg(π) = 3. We know that g(X) = 2. We want to find g(Y) and the number of fixed points of σ, which correspond to the ramification points of π with e_i = 3.\n\nLet n be the number of fixed points of σ. Then we have:\n\n2g(X) - 2 = 3 * (2g(Y) - 2) + n(3 - 1).\n\nPlugging in g(X) = 2, we get:\n\n2 = 6g(Y) - 6 + 2n.\n\nNow, we need to find g(Y). Since σ has order 3, the quotient curve X/⟨σ⟩ has genus 0. Thus, g(Y) = 0, and we have:\n\n2 = -6 + 2n.\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn = 4.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 fixed points of the automorphism σ of order 3 on the smooth projective algebraic curve X of genus 2 over C."
