First, let's rewrite the equation as an implicit function:\n\n$F(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4x^3 = 0$\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x - 12x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nTo find the singular points, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$2x - 12x^2 = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\n$y = 0$\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation:\n\n$2x(1 - 6x) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x:\n\n$x = 0$ or $x = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nSo, we have two singular points:\n\n$(0, 0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{6}, 0)$"
