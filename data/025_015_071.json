    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1, 0, -1), we need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2xz - 1.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n∂F/∂x = 2x + 2y + 2z\n∂F/∂y = 2y + 2x + 2z\n∂F/∂z = 2z + 2y + 2x\n\nNow, evaluate the partial derivatives at the point (1, 0, -1):\n∂F/∂x(1, 0, -1) = 2(1) + 2(0) + 2(-1) = 0\n∂F/∂y(1, 0, -1) = 2(0) + 2(1) + 2(-1) = 0\n∂F/∂z(1, 0, -1) = 2(-1) + 2(0) + 2(1) = 0\n\nThe gradient of F at the point (1, 0, -1) is (0, 0, 0), which means the surface is degenerate at this point and does not have a well-defined tangent plane."
