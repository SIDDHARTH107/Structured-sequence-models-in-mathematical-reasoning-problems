    "message_1": "Here's a question for the math student: \n\nIn a principal-agent relationship, the principal will offer a bonus to the agent if a certain target is met. Assume that the principal has a utility function U(p, b) = p × b, where p is the probability of achieving the target and b is the bonus offered. The agent's effort cost is C(e) = 4e, where e is the level of effort exerted. If the probability of achieving the target is given by p = 0.8 - 0.1e, find the optimal level of effort that the agent should exert to maximize the principal's utility. Also, determine the bonus amount that the principal should offer to induce the agent to exert the optimal effort level.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal level of effort that the agent should exert to maximize the principal's utility, we first need to find the optimal combination of p and b. The principal's utility function is U(p, b) = p × b, and the probability of achieving the target is given by p = 0.8 - 0.1e. \n\nWe can substitute the expression for p into the utility function:\n\nU(e, b) = (0.8 - 0.1e) × b\n\nNow we need to find the optimal level of effort e that maximizes the principal's utility. To do this, we can take the partial derivative of U(e, b) with respect to e and set it equal to 0:\n\ndU(e, b)/de = -0.1b = 0\n\nSince b cannot be 0 (otherwise, there would be no incentive for the agent to exert any effort), the partial derivative being 0 implies that the optimal level of effort e is not affected by the bonus b. \n\nNow let's find the optimal level of effort e that maximizes the agent's utility. The agent's utility is the bonus received minus the cost of effort:\n\nA(e, b) = p × b - C(e) = (0.8 - 0.1e) × b - 4e\n\nThe agent will choose the level of effort e that maximizes their utility. To find this, we can take the partial derivative of A(e, b) with respect to e and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA(e, b)/de = -0.1b - 4 = 0\n\nSolving for e, we get:\n\ne = (-0.1b - 4) / (-0.1) = b + 40\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for e back into the probability function:\n\np = 0.8 - 0.1(b + 40) = 0.8 - 0.1b - 4 = -0.1b - 3.2\n\nSince the probability p must be between 0 and 1, we have:\n\n0 ≤ -0.1b - 3.2 ≤ 1\n\nSolving for b, we get:\n\n32 ≤ b ≤ 40\n\nThe principal should choose a bonus b within this range to induce the agent to exert the optimal effort level. For example, if the principal offers a bonus of b = 35, the agent will exert an optimal effort level of:\n\ne = 35 + 40 = 75"
