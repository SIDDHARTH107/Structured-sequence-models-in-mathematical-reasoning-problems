    "message_1": "A researcher wants to study the relationship between a person's age, income, and level of education. They collect data from 500 individuals and perform a factor analysis. The researcher finds that two factors can explain the majority of the variance in the data.\n\nFactor 1 accounts for 60% of the variance and represents a combination of age and income. Factor 2 accounts for 25% of the variance and represents level of education.\n\nWhat is the total variance explained by the two factors? How much of the variance is left unexplained?",
    "message_2": "The total variance explained by the two factors is the sum of the variances explained by each factor. In this case, Factor 1 accounts for 60% of the variance and Factor 2 accounts for 25% of the variance. \n\nTotal variance explained = 60% + 25% = 85%\n\nTo find the amount of variance left unexplained, subtract the total variance explained from 100%.\n\nUnexplained variance = 100% - 85% = 15%\n\nSo, 85% of the variance is explained by the two factors, and 15% of the variance is left unexplained."
