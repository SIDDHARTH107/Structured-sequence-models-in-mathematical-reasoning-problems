    "message_1": "In a certain school, there are 500 students. Of these, 200 students take extracurricular activities, 150 students excel in sports and 100 students are in both categories. What is the probability that a randomly selected student from this school is either in extracurricular activities or excels in sports?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability, we first need to find the total number of students who are either in extracurricular activities or excel in sports, or both. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\nNumber of students in either category = Number of students in extracurricular activities + Number of students who excel in sports - Number of students in both categories\n\nNumber of students in either category = 200 + 150 - 100 = 250\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of students in either category by the total number of students in the school.\n\nProbability = Number of students in either category / Total number of students\n\nProbability = 250 / 500 = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from this school is either in extracurricular activities or excels in sports is 0.5 or 50%."
