    "message_1": "A communication network has a signal of the form $f(t) = 3\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 10t) + 4\\cos(2\\pi \\cdot 20t)$. Using Fourier analysis, find the amplitude and frequency of the components in the signal, and determine the total signal power.",
    "message_2": "The given signal is already in the form of a sum of sinusoids, so we can directly identify the amplitude and frequency of each component.\n\nThe first component is a sine wave with amplitude $A_1 = 3$ and frequency $f_1 = 10$ Hz. The second component is a cosine wave with amplitude $A_2 = 4$ and frequency $f_2 = 20$ Hz.\n\nNow, we need to find the total signal power. The power of a sinusoidal signal is given by the square of its amplitude divided by 2. So, the power of the first component is:\n\n$P_1 = \\frac{A_1^2}{2} = \\frac{3^2}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}$\n\nAnd the power of the second component is:\n\n$P_2 = \\frac{A_2^2}{2} = \\frac{4^2}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8$\n\nSince the two components are orthogonal (i.e., their frequencies are different), we can simply add their powers to find the total signal power:\n\n$P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 = \\frac{9}{2} + 8 = \\frac{9 + 16}{2} = \\frac{25}{2}$\n\nSo, the total signal power is $\\frac{25}{2}$.\n\nIn summary, the signal has two components: one with amplitude 3 and frequency 10 Hz, and another with amplitude 4 and frequency 20 Hz. The total signal power is $\\frac{25}{2}$."
