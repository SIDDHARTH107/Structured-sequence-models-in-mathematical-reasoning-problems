The edges of the graph G are as follows:\n\n- AB, AC, AD\n- BC, BE\n- CD, CE\n- DF, EF\n\nDetermine whether G is a connected graph or not. If it is connected, find the number of connected components of the graph. If it is not connected, find the connected components of the graph.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected, we need to check if there is a path between every pair of vertices. Let's analyze the given edges:\n\n- AB, AC, AD: Vertex A is connected to vertices B, C, and D.\n- BC, BE: Vertex B is connected to vertices A, C, and E.\n- CD, CE: Vertex C is connected to vertices A, B, D, and E.\n- DF, EF: Vertex D is connected to vertices A, C, and F, and vertex E is connected to vertices B, C, and F.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that there is a path between every pair of vertices, which means the graph G is connected.\n\nSince G is connected, there is only one connected component, which includes all the vertices: {A, B, C, D, E, F}."
