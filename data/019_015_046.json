    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem from the subtopic Type theory of Mathematics:\n\nA type theory system contains five types: Bool, Nat, List, Func, and Pair. A variable `x` is of type `Func(Nat, Nat)` and a variable `y` is of type `Pair(Nat, Bool)`. What is the type of the result of the function application `(x 4)` and the first element of the pair `y`?",
    "message_2": "The function application `(x 4)` has the variable `x` of type `Func(Nat, Nat)`. Since `x` takes a `Nat` as input and returns a `Nat`, applying `(x 4)` will result in a value of type `Nat`.\n\nThe variable `y` is of type `Pair(Nat, Bool)`. The first element of the pair `y` is of type `Nat`.\n\nSo, the type of the result of the function application `(x 4)` is `Nat`, and the type of the first element of the pair `y` is also `Nat`."
