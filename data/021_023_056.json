    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, for the given function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1, we can find the minimum value using calculus, which is more straightforward and efficient.\n\nTo find the minimum value of f(x), we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 2\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n\n0 = 2x + 2\nx = -1\n\nNow, we can find the second derivative to determine if this critical point is a minimum or maximum:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince f''(x) is positive, the critical point x = -1 is a minimum. Now we can find the minimum value of f(x) by plugging x = -1 back into the original function:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 1\nf(-1) = 1 - 2 + 1\nf(-1) = 0\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) is 0."
