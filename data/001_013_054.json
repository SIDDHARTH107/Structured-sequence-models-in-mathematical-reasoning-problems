    "message_2": "First, we want to isolate the square root term. To do this, we will subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$\\sqrt{2x+1} + 3 - 3 = 8 - 3$\n\n$\\sqrt{2x+1} = 5$\n\nNow, we want to get rid of the square root. To do this, we will square both sides of the equation:\n\n$(\\sqrt{2x+1})^2 = 5^2$\n\n$2x + 1 = 25$\n\nNext, we want to isolate the x term. We will subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$2x + 1 - 1 = 25 - 1$\n\n$2x = 24$\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:\n\n$2x \\div 2 = 24 \\div 2$\n\n$x = 12$\n\nSo, the solution for x is 12."
