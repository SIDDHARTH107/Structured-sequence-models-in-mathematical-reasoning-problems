    "message_2": "To find the probability that a customer prefers brand A or B, we simply add the probabilities of each preference.\n\nProbability of preferring brand A = 40% = 0.4\nProbability of preferring brand B = 30% = 0.3\n\nProbability of preferring brand A or B = Probability of preferring brand A + Probability of preferring brand B\n\nProbability of preferring brand A or B = 0.4 + 0.3 = 0.7\n\nSo, the probability that a customer prefers brand A or B is 0.7 or 70%."
