    "message_2": "The chromatic number of the given graph is 3.\n\nOne possible coloring is:\n- Color A with color 1\n- Color B with color 2 (since it is adjacent to A)\n- Color C with color 3 (since it is adjacent to both A and B)\n- Color D with color 1 (since it is adjacent to B and C, but not A)\n\nNo two adjacent vertices have the same color, and we used the minimum number of colors possible."
