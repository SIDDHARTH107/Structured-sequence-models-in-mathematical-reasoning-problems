    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces 10,000 toys every day. If you want to estimate the average weight of the toys, how many toys should you sample for an accuracy of 2 grams? Assume the standard deviation of the weight is 5 grams.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the average weight of the toys with a given accuracy, we can use the formula for sample size in a statistical estimation problem. The formula is:\n\nn = (Z^2 * σ^2) / E^2\n\nwhere:\nn = sample size\nZ = Z-score (which corresponds to the desired confidence level)\nσ = standard deviation of the population (in this case, the weight of the toys)\nE = margin of error (the accuracy we want to achieve, in this case, 2 grams)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the Z-score for our desired confidence level. Commonly used confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%. Let's assume we want a 95% confidence level. The corresponding Z-score for a 95% confidence level is 1.96.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 5^2) / 2^2\nn = (3.8416 * 25) / 4\nn = 96.04 / 4\nn = 24.01\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a toy, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need to sample 25 toys to estimate the average weight with an accuracy of 2 grams and a 95% confidence level."
