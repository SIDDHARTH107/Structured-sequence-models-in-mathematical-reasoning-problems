    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle with center $0$ and radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ under the mapping $f(z) = z^3$, we can consider the points on the circle and see how they are transformed by the function.\n\nThe circle with center $0$ and radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ can be parametrized by $z = \\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle in radians and $0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi$. Now, we can apply the function $f(z)$ to this parametrization:\n\n$$f(z) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}e^{3i\\theta}.$$\n\nThis is the parametrization of the image of the circle under the mapping $f(z)$. The image is another circle with center $0$ and radius $\\frac{1}{8}$. The angle has been tripled, but since the circle is a closed curve, the image still covers the entire circle. Therefore, the image of the circle with center $0$ and radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ under the mapping $f(z) = z^3$ is the circle with center $0$ and radius $\\frac{1}{8}$."
