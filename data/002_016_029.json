    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the length of a side in an equilateral triangle with a perimeter of 18 cm. What is the length of each side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we need to divide the perimeter by the number of sides. An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides.\n\nPerimeter = 18 cm\nNumber of sides = 3\n\nLength of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides = 18 cm / 3 = 6 cm\n\nEach side of the equilateral triangle is 6 cm long."
