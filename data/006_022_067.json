    "message_2": "To find the percentage of students who pass at least one of the exams, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that the probability of either of two events occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring individually, minus the probability of both events occurring together.\n\nLet A be the event of passing the math exam, and B be the event of passing the science exam. We are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.60 (60% pass the math exam)\nP(B) = 0.40 (40% pass the science exam)\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.30 (30% pass both exams)\n\nWe want to find the probability of passing at least one of the exams, which is the probability of the union of events A and B:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nPlugging in the given probabilities:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.60 + 0.40 - 0.30\nP(A ∪ B) = 1.00 - 0.30\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.70\n\nSo, 70% of the students pass at least one of the exams in the school."
