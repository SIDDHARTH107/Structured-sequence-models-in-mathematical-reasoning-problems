    "message_2": "To find (AxB)', we first need to find AxB. The Cartesian product AxB is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So,\n\nAxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nNow, let's consider the universal set U. For simplicity, let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, the complement of AxB, denoted as (AxB)', is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in U and b is in U, but (a, b) is not in AxB. So,\n\n(AxB)' = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}\n\nNow, let's find A' and B'. The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. Similarly, the complement of B, denoted as B', is the set of all elements in U that are not in B. So,\n\nA' = {3, 4}\nB' = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find A'xB'. The Cartesian product A'xB' is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A' and b is in B'. So,\n\nA'xB' = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow, let's verify if the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over complement. If it is distributive, then (AxB)' should be equal to A'xB'. However, we can see that:\n\n(AxB)' = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}\nA'xB' = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nSince (AxB)' â‰  A'xB', we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
