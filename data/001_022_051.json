    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x + 8, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x + 8\n\nNow, we need to find the factors of this polynomial. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (8) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, and ±8.\n\nBy trying these possible roots, we find that x = -1 is a root:\n\n0 = (-1)^3 - 5(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 8\n0 = -1 - 5 - 6 + 8\n0 = 0\n\nSo, x = -1 is a root, and (x + 1) is a factor. Now, we need to perform polynomial division to find the other factors:\n\n(x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x + 8) / (x + 1)\n\nUsing synthetic division or long division, we find the quotient to be:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 8\n\nNow, we need to factor this quadratic:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 8 = (x - 2)(x - 4)\n\nSo, the complete factorization of the polynomial is:\n\ny = (x + 1)(x - 2)(x - 4)\n\nNow, we can find the x-intercepts by setting y = 0:\n\n0 = (x + 1)(x - 2)(x - 4)\n\nThis equation is true when any of the factors are equal to 0:\n\nx + 1 = 0 => x = -1\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx - 4 = 0 => x = 4\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = -1, x = 2, and x = 4.\n\nTo graph the function, we can plot the x-intercepts and a few other points to get an idea of the shape of the curve. Here are some points to consider:\n\n(-2, 0) [x-intercept]\n(-1, 0) [x-intercept]\n(0, 8)\n(1, 10)\n(2, 0) [x-intercept]\n(3, 2)\n(4, 0) [x-intercept]\n(5, 18)\n\nPlotting these points and connecting them with a smooth curve, we get the graph of the function y = x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x + 8."
