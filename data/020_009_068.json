The profit per unit of product A is $10 and the profit per unit of product B is $15. However, the demand for these products is subject to uncertainty and follows a normal distribution with mean demand of 50 units and standard deviation of 10 units for product A, and mean demand of 70 units and standard deviation of 15 units for product B. \n\nThe company's production capacity is limited to a maximum of 1000 units per week. Determine how many units of each product the company should produce to maximize its expected weekly profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. The company's production capacity constraint is:\n\nx + y ≤ 1000\n\nThe expected profit function is given by:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nWe want to maximize the expected profit function subject to the production capacity constraint. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function as:\n\nL(x, y, λ) = 10x + 15y - λ(x + y - 1000)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and λ and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 10 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂y = 15 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x + y - 1000 = 0\n\nSolving the first two equations for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 10\nλ = 15\n\nSince the two values of λ are not equal, we have to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: Produce only product A\nIn this case, x = 1000 and y = 0. The expected profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10(1000) + 15(0) = $10,000\n\nCase 2: Produce only product B\nIn this case, x = 0 and y = 1000. The expected profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10(0) + 15(1000) = $15,000\n\nComparing the expected profits for the two cases, we see that producing only product B results in a higher expected profit. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 1000 units of product B to maximize its expected weekly profit."
