    "message_1": "During a magic show, the magician has a deck of 52 cards and pulls out a card at random. What is the probability that the card pulled out will be a black queen?",
    "message_2": "There are 2 black queens in a standard deck of 52 cards: the Queen of Spades and the Queen of Clubs. To find the probability of drawing a black queen, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 2 (drawing either the Queen of Spades or the Queen of Clubs), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (since there are 52 cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a black queen is:\n\nProbability = 2 / 52 = 1 / 26 â‰ˆ 0.0385\n\nAs a percentage, this is approximately 3.85%."
