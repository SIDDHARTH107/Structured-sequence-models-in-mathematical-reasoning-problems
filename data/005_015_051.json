The data collected shows the following information:\n\nCluster 1: Customers who spend between $100 to $499 per month\nCluster 2: Customers who spend between $500 to $999 per month\nCluster 3: Customers who spend $1000 or more per month\n\nThe number of customers in each cluster are:\n\nCluster 1: 250 customers\nCluster 2: 150 customers\nCluster 3: 100 customers\n\nCalculate the overall percentage of customers that spend between $100 to $999 per month.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the overall percentage of customers that spend between $100 to $999 per month, we need to first find the total number of customers in Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, and then divide that by the total number of customers in all clusters.\n\nTotal customers in Cluster 1 and Cluster 2: 250 (Cluster 1) + 150 (Cluster 2) = 400 customers\n\nTotal customers in all clusters: 250 (Cluster 1) + 150 (Cluster 2) + 100 (Cluster 3) = 500 customers\n\nNow, we can find the percentage of customers that spend between $100 to $999 per month:\n\nPercentage = (Number of customers in Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 / Total number of customers) * 100\nPercentage = (400 / 500) * 100\nPercentage = 0.8 * 100\nPercentage = 80%\n\nSo, 80% of the customers spend between $100 to $999 per month."
