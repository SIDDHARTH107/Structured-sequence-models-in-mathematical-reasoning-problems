    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and their opposite angles as A, B, and C respectively. In this case, let a = 7, b = 13, and c = 15. We want to find the largest angle, which will be the angle opposite the longest side. Since c is the longest side, we want to find angle C.\n\nUsing the law of cosines, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n15^2 = 7^2 + 13^2 - 2 * 7 * 13 * cos(C)\n\nSolving for cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (7^2 + 13^2 - 15^2) / (2 * 7 * 13)\n\ncos(C) = (49 + 169 - 225) / 182\n\ncos(C) = (-7) / 182\n\nNow, we find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nC = arccos(-7/182)\n\nC ≈ 95.41°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 95.41°."
