    "message_1": "A teacher wants to organize a project for their class of 20 students. The project requires each student to work in a group of exactly 4 students. How many groups can the teacher form?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of groups the teacher can form, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, k is the number of students in each group, and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nIn this case, n = 20 and k = 4.\n\nC(20, 4) = 20! / (4!(20-4)!)\n\nC(20, 4) = 20! / (4!16!)\n\nC(20, 4) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16!)/(4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 16!)\n\nC(20, 4) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17)/(4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(20, 4) = (2 × 10 × 19 × 3 × 6 × 17)\n\nC(20, 4) = 4845\n\nSo, the teacher can form 4845 different groups of 4 students each."
