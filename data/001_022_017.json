    "message_2": "To find the vertex of a quadratic function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b/(2a). Then, we can plug this x-value back into the original equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\nIn this case, the function is y = 2x^2 - 8x + 5, so a = 2, b = -8, and c = 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\nx = -(-8) / (2 * 2)\nx = 8 / 4\nx = 2\n\nNow, let's find the y-coordinate by plugging the x-value back into the original equation:\n\ny = 2(2)^2 - 8(2) + 5\ny = 2(4) - 16 + 5\ny = 8 - 16 + 5\ny = -8 + 5\ny = -3\n\nSo, the vertex of the polynomial function y = 2x^2 - 8x + 5 is (2, -3)."
