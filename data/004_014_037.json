    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid, we will use the method of slicing. We will integrate the area of the semicircular cross-sections along the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of a semicircular cross-section at a given x. The diameter of the semicircle is equal to the length of the curve y = x² at that x. So, the radius of the semicircle is half of the length, which is (x²)/2. The area of a semicircle is given by the formula (1/2)πr², where r is the radius.\n\nSo, the area of a semicircular cross-section at a given x is:\n\nA(x) = (1/2)π((x²)/2)² = (1/2)π(x²/2)² = (1/2)π(x^4/4)\n\nNow, we will integrate this area function along the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 2 to find the volume of the solid:\n\nV = ∫[A(x) dx] from 0 to 2\nV = ∫[(1/2)π(x^4/4) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nTo integrate, we use the power rule for integration:\n\nV = (1/2)π ∫[x^4/4 dx] from 0 to 2\nV = (1/2)π [(1/5)x^5/4] from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nV = (1/2)π[((1/5)(2^5)/4) - ((1/5)(0^5)/4)]\nV = (1/2)π[(1/5)(32)/4]\nV = (1/2)π[32/20]\nV = (1/2)π[8/5]\n\nSo, the volume of the solid is:\n\nV = (4/5)π cubic units."
