    "message_2": "The Bat Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. It is used to find the global minimum of a function. Here, we will use the Bat Algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4cos(x) - 4cos(y) with the given bounds and tolerance.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters of the Bat Algorithm:\n   Number of bats (n) = 20\n   Lower bounds (lb) = -10 for both x and y\n   Upper bounds (ub) = 10 for both x and y\n   Frequency (fmin, fmax) = (0, 1)\n   Loudness (A0) = 1\n   Pulse rate (r0) = 0.5\n   Maximum number of iterations (Max_iter) = 1000\n   Tolerance (tol) = 0.001\n\n2. Initialize the positions and velocities of the bats:\n   Generate n random positions (x, y) within the given bounds.\n   Initialize the velocities (v) to zero.\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each bat's position using the given function f(x, y).\n\n4. Find the best position (xbest, ybest) among all bats.\n\n5. Iterate until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the tolerance is met:\n   a. Update the frequency, velocity, and position of each bat.\n   b. Generate a new solution for each bat using the current best solution and a random number.\n   c. If the new solution is better than the current solution and a random number is less than the pulse rate, update the bat's position and loudness.\n   d. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   e. Update the best solution if the new solution is better.\n\n6. The minimum value of the function is the fitness of the best solution (xbest, ybest).\n\nNote that the Bat Algorithm involves random numbers and may produce slightly different results in each run. To increase the accuracy of the solution, you can run the algorithm multiple times and take the average of the best solutions."
