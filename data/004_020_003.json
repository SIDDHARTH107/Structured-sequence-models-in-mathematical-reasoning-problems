The displacement of the object is along the x-axis and is given by x(t) = 5t^2 - 10t, where x is in meters and t is in seconds. Find the work done by the force in moving the object from t = 0 to t = 2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force in moving the object from t = 0 to t = 2 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Displacement × cosθ\n\nSince the force is applied along the x-axis and the displacement is also along the x-axis, the angle between them is 0 degrees. Therefore, cosθ = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the displacement of the object from t = 0 to t = 2 seconds.\n\nThe displacement function is given by x(t) = 5t^2 - 10t.\n\nLet's find the displacement at t = 0 and t = 2 seconds:\n\nx(0) = 5(0)^2 - 10(0) = 0\nx(2) = 5(2)^2 - 10(2) = 5(4) - 20 = 20 - 20 = 0\n\nThe displacement from t = 0 to t = 2 seconds is 0 meters. Since there is no displacement, the work done by the force is also 0.\n\nWork = Force × Displacement × cosθ = 1000 N × 0 m × 1 = 0 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force in moving the object from t = 0 to t = 2 seconds is 0 Joules."
