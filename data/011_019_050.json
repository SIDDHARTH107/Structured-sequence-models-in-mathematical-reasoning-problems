The levels for each factor are -1, 0, and +1. \n\n(a) Construct an orthogonal array for this design. \n\n(b) Suppose we wish to run 9 experiments using this design. Use the orthogonal array to determine which experiments should be run.",
    "message_2": "(a) An orthogonal array for this design can be constructed using the L9 (3^3) array, which is a 9x3 array representing the 9 possible combinations of the 3 factors at 3 levels. The L9 (3^3) array is as follows:\n\n```\nExperiment | Factor A | Factor B | Factor C\n-------------------------------------------\n     1      |    -1    |    -1    |    -1\n     2      |    -1    |     0    |     0\n     3      |    -1    |    +1    |    +1\n     4      |     0    |    -1    |     0\n     5      |     0    |     0    |    -1\n     6      |     0    |    +1    |    +1\n     7      |    +1    |    -1    |    +1\n     8      |    +1    |     0    |     0\n     9      |    +1    |    +1    |    -1\n```\n\n(b) To run 9 experiments using this design, we can simply use the 9 rows of the orthogonal array as the combinations of factor levels for each experiment. The experiments to be run are as follows:\n\n1. Experiment 1: Factor A = -1, Factor B = -1, Factor C = -1\n2. Experiment 2: Factor A = -1, Factor B = 0, Factor C = 0\n3. Experiment 3: Factor A = -1, Factor B = +1, Factor C = +1\n4. Experiment 4: Factor A = 0, Factor B = -1, Factor C = 0\n5. Experiment 5: Factor A = 0, Factor B = 0, Factor C = -1\n6. Experiment 6: Factor A = 0, Factor B = +1, Factor C = +1\n7. Experiment 7: Factor A = +1, Factor B = -1, Factor C = +1\n8. Experiment 8: Factor A = +1, Factor B = 0, Factor C = 0\n9. Experiment 9: Factor A = +1, Factor B = +1, Factor C = -1"
