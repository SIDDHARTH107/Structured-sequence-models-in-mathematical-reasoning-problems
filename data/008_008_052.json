    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of assembly time and 3 hours of finishing time, while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of assembly time and 2 hours of finishing time. The company can spend a maximum of 100 hours on assembly and a maximum of 90 hours on finishing each week. Each unit of Product A brings in a profit of $10, while each unit of Product B brings in a profit of $12. How many units of Product A and Product B should the company produce each week to maximize its profit and what is the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for assembly and finishing time can be represented as inequalities:\n\nAssembly time: 2x + 2y ≤ 100\nFinishing time: 3x + 2y ≤ 90\n\nWe can simplify the assembly time inequality by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + y ≤ 50\n\nNow we have a system of linear inequalities:\n\nx + y ≤ 50\n3x + 2y ≤ 90\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 12y\n\nWe will use the graphical method to find the feasible region and the optimal solution.\n\nFirst, we'll find the boundary lines for the inequalities:\n\nx + y = 50\ny = -x + 50\n\n3x + 2y = 90\ny = -(3/2)x + 45\n\nNow, we'll find the intersection points of these lines:\n\nIntersection of x + y = 50 and 3x + 2y = 90:\n\nx + y = 50\n3x + 2(-x + 50) = 90\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx + 100 - 2x = 90\nx = 10\n\nSubstituting x back into x + y = 50:\n\n10 + y = 50\ny = 40\n\nSo, the intersection point is (10, 40).\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region. Since both inequalities are \"less than or equal to,\" the feasible region will be below and to the left of the lines. The feasible region will be a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 45), and (10, 40).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\nP(0, 45) = 10(0) + 12(45) = $540\nP(10, 40) = 10(10) + 12(40) = $580\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 10 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $580 per week."
