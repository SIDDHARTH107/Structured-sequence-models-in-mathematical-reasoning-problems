    "message_2": "The problem statement seems to have a small confusion. The fundamental group is defined for a topological space, not for a pair of points. So, we should be looking for the fundamental group of $S^2$ with two points removed, say $p$ and $q$. Let's denote this punctured sphere by $X = S^2 - \\{p, q\\}$.\n\nNow, we will compute the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\nConsider a stereographic projection from the point $p$ onto a plane. Under this projection, the sphere $S^2$ minus the point $p$ is homeomorphic to the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The point $q$ will be projected to some point $q'$ in the plane. So, we have a homeomorphism $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{q'\\}$.\n\nNow, let's compute the fundamental group of $\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{q'\\}$. We can use the deformation retraction of $\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{q'\\}$ onto a circle $S^1$ centered at $q'$ with some radius. This deformation retraction gives us a homotopy equivalence between $\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{q'\\}$ and $S^1$. Since the fundamental group is a homotopy invariant, we have $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{q'\\}) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1)$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the circle $S^1$ is well-known to be isomorphic to the integers, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, since $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{q'\\}$ is a homeomorphism, it induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups of $X$ and $\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{q'\\}$. Therefore, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{q'\\}) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the punctured sphere $S^2 - \\{p, q\\}$ is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^2 - \\{p, q\\}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
