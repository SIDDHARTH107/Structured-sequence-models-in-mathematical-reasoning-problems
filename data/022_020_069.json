    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we first need to find the characteristic equation, which is given by:\n\n$$r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for r by factoring:\n\n$$(r - 1)(r - 2) = 0$$\n\nThis gives us two roots, $r_1 = 1$ and $r_2 = 2$. Therefore, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\n$$y(x) = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{2x}$$\n\nNow, we need to use the boundary conditions to find the particular solution. First, we apply the boundary condition $y(0) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = c_1 e^{0} + c_2 e^{0} \\Rightarrow 0 = c_1 + c_2$$\n\nNext, we apply the boundary condition $y(1) + y'(1) = 1$. First, we find the derivative of $y(x)$:\n\n$$y'(x) = c_1 e^{x} + 2c_2 e^{2x}$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary condition:\n\n$$y(1) + y'(1) = c_1 e^{1} + c_2 e^{2} + c_1 e^{1} + 2c_2 e^{2} = 1$$\n\nSince $c_1 + c_2 = 0$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$2c_1 e^{1} + 3c_2 e^{2} = 1$$\n\nNow, we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n\n$$\\begin{cases}\nc_1 + c_2 = 0 \\\\\n2c_1 e + 3c_2 e^2 = 1\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\n$$c_1 = \\frac{3e^2 - 2e}{e^2 - 1}, \\quad c_2 = -\\frac{3e^2 - 2e}{e^2 - 1}$$\n\nThus, the particular solution is:\n\n$$y(x) = \\frac{3e^2 - 2e}{e^2 - 1} e^{x} - \\frac{3e^2 - 2e}{e^2 - 1} e^{2x}$$\n\nFinally, we find the value of $y(1/2)$:\n\n$$y\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3e^2 - 2e}{e^2 - 1} e^{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\frac{3e^2 - 2e}{e^2 - 1} e^{1} \\approx 0.3517$$\n\nSo, the value of $y(1/2)$ is approximately $0.3517$."
