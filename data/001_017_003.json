    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x-4) + log(x+3) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the product rule of logarithms, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), we can combine the two logarithms:\n\nlog((x-4)(x+3)) = 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form to get rid of the logarithm:\n\n10^2 = (x-4)(x+3)\n\n100 = x^2 - x - 12\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. To solve for x, we can either factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is possible:\n\n0 = x^2 - x - 112\n\n0 = (x-12)(x+9)\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx-12 = 0 => x = 12\nx+9 = 0 => x = -9\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. If we plug in x = 12:\n\nlog(12-4) + log(12+3) = log(8) + log(15) = 2\n\nThis solution is valid. However, if we plug in x = -9:\n\nlog(-9-4) + log(-9+3)\n\nSince we cannot take the logarithm of a negative number, this solution is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for x is x = 12."
