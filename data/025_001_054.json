    "message_1": "Suppose we have two algebraic curves in the plane given by the equations:\n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 - 5x - 6y + 10 = 0\nC2: 2x^2 + 2y^2 - 4x - 4y + 4 = 0\n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, find the number of points of intersection of C1 and C2 in the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves in the complex plane is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the curves have no common components and that we count intersection points with their multiplicities.\n\nThe degree of a curve is the highest total degree of its terms. In this case, both C1 and C2 are quadratic equations, so their degrees are both 2.\n\nTherefore, by Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of C1 and C2 in the complex plane is 2 * 2 = 4."
