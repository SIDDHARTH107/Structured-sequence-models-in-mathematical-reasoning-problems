    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 3  2 -1 |  7]\n[ 6 -3  2 |  1]\n[ 2  1  1 |  4]\n```\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[ 1  2/3 -1/3 |  7/3]\n[ 6 -3  2   |  1  ]\n[ 2  1  1   |  4  ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the first row. Subtract 6 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2/3 -1/3 |  7/3]\n[ 0 -7  4   | -11 ]\n[ 0  1/3  4/3 |  8/3]\n```\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by -1/7 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2/3 -1/3 |  7/3]\n[ 0  1  -4/7 |  11/7]\n[ 0  1/3  4/3 |  8/3]\n```\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below and above the second row. Subtract 2/3 times the second row from the first row, and subtract 1/3 times the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  1/3 |  3/3]\n[ 0  1 -4/7 | 11/7]\n[ 0  0  4   |  4  ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 4 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  1/3 |  1  ]\n[ 0  1 -4/7 | 11/7]\n[ 0  0  1   |  1  ]\n```\n\nStep 6: Eliminate the third column above the third row. Add 1/3 times the third row to the first row, and add 4/7 times the third row to the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0   |  0  ]\n[ 0  1  0   |  2  ]\n[ 0  0  1   |  1  ]\n```\n\nThe system of linear equations is now in reduced row echelon form, and we can read off the solutions:\n\nx = 0\ny = 2\nz = 1"
