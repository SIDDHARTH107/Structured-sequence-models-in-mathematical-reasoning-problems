    "message_2": "To show that the sequence $(f^n(1))_{n=0}^\\infty$ converges in $(X,d)$, we need to show that it is a Cauchy sequence. Recall that a sequence $(x_n)_{n=0}^\\infty$ in a metric space $(X,d)$ is Cauchy if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m, n \\geq N$, we have $d(x_m, x_n) < \\epsilon$.\n\nLet's first compute the terms of the sequence $(f^n(1))_{n=0}^\\infty$. We have:\n\n- $f^0(1) = 1$\n- $f^1(1) = f(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $f^2(1) = f(f(1)) = f(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $f^3(1) = f(f(f(1))) = f(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nIn general, we have $f^n(1) = \\frac{1}{2^n}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNow, let $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. We want to find an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m, n \\geq N$, we have $d(f^m(1), f^n(1)) < \\epsilon$. Note that:\n\n$$d(f^m(1), f^n(1)) = \\left|\\frac{1}{2^m} - \\frac{1}{2^n}\\right| = \\frac{|2^n - 2^m|}{2^{m+n}} \\leq \\frac{2^{\\max(m,n)}}{2^{m+n}} = \\frac{1}{2^{\\min(m,n)}}$$\n\nNow, choose $N$ such that $\\frac{1}{2^N} < \\epsilon$. Then, for all $m, n \\geq N$, we have:\n\n$$d(f^m(1), f^n(1)) \\leq \\frac{1}{2^{\\min(m,n)}} \\leq \\frac{1}{2^N} < \\epsilon$$\n\nThus, the sequence $(f^n(1))_{n=0}^\\infty$ is Cauchy in $(X,d)$.\n\nSince $(X,d)$ is a subset of the real numbers with the standard metric, it is complete, meaning that every Cauchy sequence converges to a limit in $(X,d)$. Therefore, the sequence $(f^n(1))_{n=0}^\\infty$ converges to some limit $L \\in X$.\n\nTo find the limit $L$, note that since $f$ is continuous, we have:\n\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f^n(1) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(f^{n-1}(1)) = f\\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f^{n-1}(1)\\right) = f(L)$$\n\nThis means that $L = \\frac{L}{2}$, which implies that $L = 0$. Thus, the sequence $(f^n(1))_{n=0}^\\infty$ converges to $0$ in $(X,d)$."
