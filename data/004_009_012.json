    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x + 1)(3x^2 - 2x + 5) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together:\n\nu(x) = 2x + 1\nv(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 5\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(2x + 1)/dx = 2\nv'(x) = d(3x^2 - 2x + 5)/dx = 6x - 2\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nd(uv)/dx = u'v + uv'\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (2)(3x^2 - 2x + 5) + (2x + 1)(6x - 2)\n\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 4x + 10 + 12x^2 - 4x + 6x - 2\nf'(x) = 18x^2 - 2x + 8\n\nThus, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x + 1)(3x^2 - 2x + 5) is:\n\nf'(x) = 18x^2 - 2x + 8"
