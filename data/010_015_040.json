    "message_2": "First, let's prove the existence of a closed $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$ on $M$ such that $\\int_M \\omega \\wedge \\eta \\neq 0$. Since $[\\omega] \\neq 0 \\in H^k(M; \\mathbb{R})$, there exists a $(k-1)$-cycle $C$ such that $\\int_C \\omega \\neq 0$. Now, let's consider the Poincaré dual of $C$, which is a closed $(n-k+1)$-form $\\eta$. By definition of the Poincaré dual, we have that $\\int_M \\omega \\wedge \\eta = \\int_C \\omega \\neq 0$. Thus, we have found the desired closed $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $M$ is a compact, oriented surface of genus 2. The given 1-form $\\alpha$ is not well-defined on $M$ since $x, y, z$ are not coordinate functions on a 2-dimensional manifold. Instead, we need to find a suitable 1-form on $M$ and compute its integrals over the curves $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$.\n\nLet $M$ be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function on $M$. We can define a 1-form $\\alpha$ on $M$ as the differential of $f$, i.e., $\\alpha = df$. Since $M$ is a surface of genus 2, it has a fundamental group with four generators, say $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2$, and their commutators generate the first homology group $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. We can choose $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ to be representatives of two of these generators, say $a_1$ and $a_2$.\n\nNow, let's compute the integrals of $\\alpha$ over $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$. Since $\\alpha = df$, we have\n$$\\int_{\\gamma_1} \\alpha = \\int_{\\gamma_1} df = f(\\gamma_1(1)) - f(\\gamma_1(0)) = 0,$$\nand\n$$\\int_{\\gamma_2} \\alpha = \\int_{\\gamma_2} df = f(\\gamma_2(1)) - f(\\gamma_2(0)) = 0.$$\n\nHowever, this does not imply that the integrals of $\\alpha$ over $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are always equal for any 1-form $\\alpha$. In fact, we can find a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that its integrals over $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are different. For example, let $\\alpha = \\omega_1$ be a harmonic 1-form representing the cohomology class dual to $a_1$. Then, by definition of the Poincaré dual, we have\n$$\\int_{\\gamma_1} \\alpha = \\int_{a_1} \\omega_1 = \\langle [\\omega_1], [a_1] \\rangle = 1,$$\nand\n$$\\int_{\\gamma_2} \\alpha = \\int_{a_2} \\omega_1 = \\langle [\\omega_1], [a_2] \\rangle = 0.$$\n\nThus, we have shown that there exists a 1-form $\\alpha$ on $M$ such that its integrals over the curves $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are not equal."
