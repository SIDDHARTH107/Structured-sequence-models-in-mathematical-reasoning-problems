    "message_2": "To determine the radius of convergence and interval of convergence for the given power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. \n\nLet's denote the general term of the series as $a_n = \\frac{(2x+1)^n}{2^n n^2}$. Then, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(2x+1)^{n+1}}{2^{n+1} (n+1)^2}}{\\frac{(2x+1)^n}{2^n n^2}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(2x+1)(n^2)}{2(n+1)^2}\\right|$$\n\nNow, we want this limit to be less than 1 for the series to converge:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(2x+1)(n^2)}{2(n+1)^2}\\right| < 1$$\n\nAs $n$ approaches infinity, the limit becomes:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{2x+1}{2}\\right| < 1$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$-1 < 2x+1 < 1$$\n$$-2 < 2x < 0$$\n$$-1 < x < 0$$\n\nThus, the interval of convergence is $(-1, 0)$. Now, let's find the radius of convergence. The radius of convergence is half the length of the interval of convergence:\n\n$$R = \\frac{0 - (-1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSo, the radius of convergence is $\\frac{1}{2}$. In summary, the interval of convergence for the given power series is $(-1, 0)$, and the radius of convergence is $\\frac{1}{2}$."
