    "message_2": "There are 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 48. Their corresponding group structures and isomorphism classes are as follows:\n\n1. C_48: The cyclic group of order 48. It is generated by a single element of order 48.\n\n2. C_24 x C_2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 24 and a cyclic group of order 2. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\n3. C_12 x C_4: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 12 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\n4. C_8 x C_6: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 6. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n5. C_4 x C_4 x C_3: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 3. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n6. Dih_48: The dihedral group of order 48. It is the group of symmetries of a regular 24-gon, including both rotations and reflections. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic, meaning that there is no isomorphism (a bijective homomorphism) between any two of them."
