    "message_2": "A dragon curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The order of a dragon curve refers to the number of times the paper is folded.\n\nFor each increase in order, the number of segments in the dragon curve doubles. The total length of a dragon curve of order n with each straight segment having a length of 1 can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = 2^n\n\nFor a dragon curve of order 10:\n\nLength = 2^10 = 1024\n\nSo, the total length of a dragon curve of order 10 with each straight segment having a length of 1 is 1024 units."
