    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase angle of the signal components at 3Hz and 5Hz, we can represent the given signal f(t) in terms of its sinusoidal components:\n\nf(t) = A1 * sin(3t + φ1) + A2 * sin(5t + φ2)\n\nwhere A1 and A2 are the amplitudes, and φ1 and φ2 are the phase angles of the 3Hz and 5Hz components, respectively.\n\nGiven f(t) = 2sin(3t) + 3cos(5t), we can rewrite the cosine term as a sine term with a phase shift:\n\n3cos(5t) = 3sin(5t + π/2)\n\nNow, we can compare the given signal with the general form:\n\nA1 * sin(3t + φ1) = 2sin(3t) => A1 = 2, φ1 = 0\nA2 * sin(5t + φ2) = 3sin(5t + π/2) => A2 = 3, φ2 = π/2\n\nSo, the amplitude and phase angle of the signal components at 3Hz and 5Hz are:\n\n3Hz component: Amplitude A1 = 2, Phase angle φ1 = 0\n5Hz component: Amplitude A2 = 3, Phase angle φ2 = π/2"
