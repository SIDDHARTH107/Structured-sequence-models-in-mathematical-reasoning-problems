The cost of the material used for the top and bottom of the container is $20 per square meter and the cost of the material used for the sides is $10 per square meter. Find the dimensions of the container that will minimize the cost of the material.",
    "message_2": "Let the radius of the cylindrical container be r meters and the height be h meters. The volume V of the cylinder is given by:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nWe are given that the volume is 500 cubic meters, so:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nNow we need to find the cost function that we want to minimize. The cost of the top and bottom of the container is $20 per square meter, and the area of the top and bottom is given by:\n\nA_top_bottom = 2 * πr^2\n\nThe cost of the sides of the container is $10 per square meter, and the area of the sides is given by:\n\nA_sides = 2πrh\n\nNow we can write the cost function C as:\n\nC = 20 * A_top_bottom + 10 * A_sides\nC = 20 * (2 * πr^2) + 10 * (2πrh)\n\nFrom the volume equation, we can express h in terms of r:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the cost function:\n\nC = 40πr^2 + 20πr(500 / (πr^2))\nC = 40πr^2 + 10000r / r^2\n\nNow we want to minimize the cost function C with respect to r. To do this, we will find the first derivative of C with respect to r and set it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = 80πr - 10000 / r^2\n\nSetting dC/dr = 0:\n\n80πr - 10000 / r^2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by r^2:\n\n80πr^3 - 10000 = 0\n\nNow solve for r:\n\nr^3 = 10000 / (80π)\nr^3 ≈ 39.79\nr ≈ 3.42 meters\n\nNow we can find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 500 / (π(3.42)^2)\nh ≈ 14.33 meters\n\nSo the dimensions of the container that will minimize the cost of the material are approximately r = 3.42 meters and h = 14.33 meters."
