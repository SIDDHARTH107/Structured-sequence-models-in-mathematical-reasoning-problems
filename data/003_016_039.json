    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 2 cos(3x - π/4). \n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to look at the term inside the cosine function, which is (3x - π/4). The general form of a cosine function with a phase shift is cos(Bx - C), where B is the coefficient of x and C is the constant term.\n\nIn this case, B = 3 and C = π/4. To find the phase shift, we need to calculate C/B, which is:\n\nPhase shift = C/B = (π/4) / 3 = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function f(x) is π/12 radians."
