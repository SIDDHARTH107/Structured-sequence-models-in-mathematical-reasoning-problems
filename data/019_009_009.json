Negation Introduction (¬I): If we can derive a contradiction from the assumption A, then we can conclude ¬A.\n4. Negation Elimination (¬E): If we have ¬A and A, then we can derive a contradiction (⊥).\n\nProof:\n\n1. Assume (A → B) (Assumption)\n2. Assume ¬B (Assumption)\n3. Assume A (Assumption)\n4. B (→E from 1 and 3)\n5. ⊥ (¬E from 2 and 4)\n6. ¬A (¬I from 3 to 5)\n7. ¬B → ¬A (→I from 2 to 6)\n8.
