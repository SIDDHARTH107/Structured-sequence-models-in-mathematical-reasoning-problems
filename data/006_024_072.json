    "message_1": "A group of 10 friends are planning a road trip. The probability that any one individual friend will suggest taking a detour on the trip is 0.3. What is the probability that at least 3 friends will suggest taking a detour on the trip?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 3 friends will suggest taking a detour, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of the opposite event occurring. In this case, the opposite event is that 0, 1, or 2 friends suggest taking a detour. We can calculate the probabilities of these events and then subtract the sum from 1 to find the probability of at least 3 friends suggesting a detour.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x successes (friends suggesting a detour), C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, n is the total number of friends (10), p is the probability of a friend suggesting a detour (0.3), and x is the number of friends suggesting a detour.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 friends suggesting a detour:\n\nP(0) = C(10, 0) * 0.3^0 * (1-0.3)^(10-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.7^10 ≈ 0.0282\n\nP(1) = C(10, 1) * 0.3^1 * (1-0.3)^(10-1) = 10 * 0.3 * 0.7^9 ≈ 0.1211\n\nP(2) = C(10, 2) * 0.3^2 * (1-0.3)^(10-2) = 45 * 0.09 * 0.7^8 ≈ 0.2335\n\nNow, let's find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - (P(0) + P(1) + P(2)) = 1 - (0.0282 + 0.1211 + 0.2335) ≈ 1 - 0.3828 ≈ 0.6172\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 friends will suggest taking a detour on the trip is approximately 0.6172 or 61.72%."
