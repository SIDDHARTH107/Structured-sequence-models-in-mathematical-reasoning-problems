    "message_2": "The Hopf map $h: S^3 \\rightarrow S^2$ is defined as follows:\n\n$$h(q) = (q_1^2 - q_2^2, 2q_1q_2, q_3^2 - q_4^2, 2q_3q_4)$$\n\nwhere $q = (q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4) \\in S^3$.\n\nWe want to find the pre-image of the point $(0, 1, 0) \\in S^2$. So we need to solve the following equations:\n\n$$q_1^2 - q_2^2 = 0$$\n$$2q_1q_2 = 1$$\n$$q_3^2 - q_4^2 = 0$$\n$$2q_3q_4 = 0$$\n\nSince $q \\in S^3$, we also have the constraint:\n\n$$q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2 + q_4^2 = 2^2 = 4$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $q_1q_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. From the fourth equation, we have either $q_3 = 0$ or $q_4 = 0$. We will consider both cases separately.\n\nCase 1: $q_3 = 0$\n\nIn this case, we have $q_4^2 = 0$ and $q_1^2 - q_2^2 = 0$. Thus, $q_1^2 = q_2^2$. Using the constraint equation, we get:\n\n$$q_1^2 + q_2^2 = 4$$\n\nSince $q_1^2 = q_2^2$, we have $2q_1^2 = 4$, which implies $q_1^2 = 2$. Therefore, $q_1 = \\pm\\sqrt{2}$ and $q_2 = \\pm\\sqrt{2}$. Since $q_1q_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have two solutions in this case:\n\n$$q = (\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n$$q = (-\\sqrt{2}, -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n\nCase 2: $q_4 = 0$\n\nIn this case, we have $q_3^2 = 0$ and $q_1^2 - q_2^2 = 0$. Thus, $q_1^2 = q_2^2$. Using the constraint equation, we get:\n\n$$q_1^2 + q_2^2 = 4$$\n\nSince $q_1^2 = q_2^2$, we have $2q_1^2 = 4$, which implies $q_1^2 = 2$. Therefore, $q_1 = \\pm\\sqrt{2}$ and $q_2 = \\pm\\sqrt{2}$. Since $q_1q_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have two solutions in this case:\n\n$$q = (\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n$$q = (-\\sqrt{2}, -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n\nCombining both cases, we have four solutions for the pre-image of $(0, 1, 0)$:\n\n$$q_1 = (\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n$$q_2 = (-\\sqrt{2}, -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n$$q_3 = (\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n$$q_4 = (-\\sqrt{2}, -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n\nHowever, since $q_1$ and $q_3$ are the same, and $q_2$ and $q_4$ are the same, we have only two distinct pre-images:\n\n$$q_1 = (\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$\n$$q_2 = (-\\sqrt{2}, -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$$"
